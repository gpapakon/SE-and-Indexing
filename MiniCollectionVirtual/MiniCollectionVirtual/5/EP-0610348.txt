A device for fastening a cable car to suspension tackle 
(1), which is provided at its lower end with a carrying 

device (2) which undergrips a suspension frame (3) for the 
car (5), at least one shock-absorbing element (4) in the form 

of an inflatable container being arranged between the 
carrying device (2) and the suspension frame (3), 

characterised in that the carrying device (2) comprises two 
approximately parallel carrying bars (21), on each of the 

free ends of which there is arranged at least one pneumatic 
or gas spring (4) and in that the suspension frame (3) 

comprises two parallel bars (32) which are oriented 
perpendicularly to the carrying bars (21) and which rest on 

the pneumatic or gas springs (4) (Fig. 3) or in that the 
suspension frame (3) is constructed with a wall (36) 

extending in the manner of a roof, the pneumatic or gas 
springs (4) being arranged between the carrying device (2) 

and this wall (36). 
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
carrying device (2) comprises two brackets (22) connected 

with the suspension rod (1), to which brackets (22) the 
carrying bars (21) are attached and in that the suspension 

frame (3) is formed of two parallel bars (32) and two bars 
(31) extending perpendicularly thereto, to the free ends of 

which bars (31) the car (5) is attached. 
A device according to either one of claims 1 and 2, 
characterised in that the car (5) is hinged to the suspension 

frame (3) in a manner known per se by means of approximately 
horizontally oriented pins (35), whereby it is swivellable 

with respect to said frame (3).  
 
A device according to claim 3, characterised in that the 
suspension frame (3) is constructed in its outer area with 

downwardly projecting plates (34) through which pass 
suspension pins (35) for the car (5). 
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
suspension frame (3) is constructed with two walls (3
6, 37) 
spaced vertically from each other, between which the carrying 

device (2) is arranged, pneumatic or gas springs (4) being 
arranged both above and below the carrying device (2). 
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the pneumatic or gas springs (4) are 

connected together and with a central pressure medium supply 
by means of ducts (41). 
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that at least one additional mechanical 

shock-absorbing device (6) is provided between the carrying 
device (2) and the suspension frame (3). 
A device according to claim 7, characterised in that the 
at least one mechanical shock-absorbing device comprises 

rubber buffers (62, 65) and a connecting rod (63).
