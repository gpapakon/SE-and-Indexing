<ABSTRACT>
A multi-sheet overlay is placed over a basic television programs 
listing (10). Two of the sheets of the overlay are removably adhered 

together, one sheet being a transparent sheet (12) and the other sheet 
being a non-transparent sheet (14). The non-transparent sheet (14) is 

selctively kiss-cut so that select sections of the non-transparent sheet 
(14) may be removed to expose corresponding sections of the transparent 

sheet (12) and reveal selcted sections of the television programs 
listing. Data is printed on a sheet of the overlay relating to a 

television system that differs from the basic television listing. By 
selectively removing kiss-cut sections on the overlay, multiple bits of 

data may be combined to provide a television programs listing for a 
television system differing from the system represented in the basic 

television programs listing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to changing or modifying
television program broadcast listings, according to preference
or local television systems.The United States has a large number of television broadcasting
systems, where each system may include two or more
television channels or stations. There are also television
networks which broadcast their own television programs and
also sell their television programs to other television
stations and to television cable companies. Many cities or
television broadcast areas are serviced by several different
local television broadcast stations as well as one or more
television cable companies. For example, the city of New York
has three television cable companies, publicly broadcasts all
the television networks programs and has many local television
broadcasting stations. At times different cable companies
will broadcast the same television program at the same
time but on different channels or channel designations. At
times, the same television program is broadcast by different
cable companies on different channels and at different times.
Channel number designations throughout the television
broadcast industry are not uniform.Access by the public to several different television cable
companies and to many public television broadcast stations
makes the generation of a universal television program
listing a highly complex problem. It has been proposed that
individual television broadcast listing be published for each
cable company and a general television listing be published
for public broadcast television programs. This means that
people with access to two or more television broadcast
systems may be interrogating two or more television program 
listings in order to determine what is to be seen on television
and the most convenient time and channel on which to
view the program. US-A- 48 32 373 discloses an overlay for selectively blocking out or covering unwanted
information or data on a page having a predetermined layout, which overlay comprises
a transparent sheet 10 having indicia 12, 14, 16, horizontal lines 18, and a vertical line
20 printed thereon, and data blocking elements 22, which can be adhesively attached to
the transparent sheet and may be removed by blocking out unwanted information. The present invention avoids the use of a plurality of
different television program listings by using a two-sheet
adjustable television program grid. The invention provides a
two-sheet overlay which fits over and coordinates with the
information in a basic television
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A two-sheet overlay assembly for personalizing data comprising a first sheet (10)
having a first data printed on a first surface thereof, said first data being laid out in a

predetermined format, and a subassembly (12, 14) overlaying said first sheet, said
subassembly being provided with a second data being laid out in said

predetermined format for personalizing said first data,
characterised in
 that

a) said subassembly (12, 14) includes a transparent sheet (12) and a non-transparent
sheet (14), said non-transparent sheet having an adhesive means

(16) on a second surface thereof for removably adhering said non-transparent
sheet to said transparent sheet said non-transparent sheet having a second

data printed on a third surface thereof, said second data laid out in said
predetermined format, said non-transparent sheet being kiss-cut for permitting

removal of a selected portion of said second data from said non-transparent
sheet of said subassembly; and
b) said subassembly overlaying said first sheet so that said transparent sheet is
positioned on said first sheet for viewing said first data through said transparent

sheet and said non-transparent sheet is positioned on said transparent sheet
so that said second data on said non-transparent sheet, is in coincidence with

said first data on said first sheet and personalizes said first data.
A two-sheet overlay assembly for personalizing data as in claim 1, in which said first
data is a first colour and said second data is a second colour, or alternatively, said

first data is printed in a first colour and said second data is printed in a second
colour. 
A two-sheet overlay assembly for personalizing data as in claim 1, in which said first
data relates to a first television broadcasting system, and said second data relates to

a second television broadcasting system.
A two-sheet overlay assembly for personalizing data as in claim 1, in which said first
data relates to a first television program listing and said second data relates to a

second television program listing.
A two-sheet overlay assembly for personalizing data as in claim 1, in which said
adhesive means (16) is a pressure sensitive adhesive mounted on said second

surface of said subassembly and permits removal of said non-transparent portion
(14) from said transparent sheet (12).
A two-sheet overlay assembly for personalizing data as in claim 1, in which said first
data lists a plurality of television programs and a first set of channels over which said

plurality of television programs are to be broadcast and said second data lists a
second set of channels over which said plurality of television programs are to be

broadcast.
