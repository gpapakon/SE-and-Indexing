<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved high-capacity 
getter pump, suitable for creating and maintaining 
the vacuum, for instance in an ultra-high vacuum 
chamber or in a high-energy particle accelerator. Getter pumps are well known in the art and are suitable 
for creating and maintaining the vacuum. The first 
commercially successfull getter pump, described in US 
patent 3,780,501, was employing, in a housing, a pleated 
metal strip having a getter metal embedded therein. 
Additional examples of such getter pumps were described 
in US patents 3,609,064; 3,662,522; 3,961,897 and 
4,137,012. Although these former getter pumps enjoyed a 
wide commercial success and market acceptance, they 
were still suffering from a drawback, residing in a 
limited sorption capacity inside a given volume. In order to increase said sorption capacity, it was 
suggested to simply fill the pump housing with a getter 
material in the form of pellets, having size and shape 
similar to those (tablets) used in the field of drugs; 
such pellets were typically showing a cylindrical shape, 
with a diameter of 5-10 mm and a height of 2-10 mm. 
However, when the housing is filled with such pellets, 
the access of the gas to the bulky getter structure is 
far from being satisfactory. Another drawback, bound to 
the use of said pellets, was their tendency to produce 
undesired loose particles; moreover the bulky structure  
 
can show safety problems because of the possibility of 
a high exothermicity of the getter material during possible 
ignitions (in particular when the used getter material 
has a low activation temperature). Accordingly, it is a first object of the present 
invention to provide an improved getter pump substantially 
free from one or more of the drawbacks hereinabove. Another object of the invention is to provide an 
improved getter pump having a higher sorption rate per 
unit volume, with respect to the getter pumps of the 
prior art. A further object of the invention is to provide an 
improved getter pump having a higher sorption capacity 
per unit volume, with respect to the getter pumps of 
the prior art. An additional object of the invention is to provide 
an improved getter pump resorting neither to pleated 
coated strips nor to pellets of getter material. Other objects of the invention will be apparent to 
those of ordinary skill in the art, by reference to the 
following disclosure and drawings. In its broadest aspect, the invention relates to an 
improved high-capacity getter pump, suitable for

A high-capacity getter pump, suitable 
for creating and maintaining the vacuum, comprising a 

plurality of porous sintered blades made from a non-evaporable 
getter material and having: 


i) a first main surface; 
ii) a second main surface, essentially parallel to said 
first surface and spaced therefrom by a thickness 

of 0.5-5.0 mm; 
 
wherein said blades are arranged in a housing and are 

separated from each other by a gas conductance or empty 
intermediate space, with the adjacent surfaces of adjacent 

blades being spaced from each other by a distance 
of 0.5-10 mm. 
The pump of claim 1, wherein said blades are arranged 
in a substantially radial way, defining with their 

inner extremities an inner channel around a longitudinal 
axis of symmetry of the pump, there being also provided 

a heater and a fastening flange connected to said housing. 
The pump of claim 2, wherein said porous sintered 
blades have a shape selected from planar, in particular 

rectangular and optionally tapered and/or bevelled, 
concave and combinations thereof, with the axes of said 

blades forming an angle with the axial planes, passing 
for each blade through said longitudinal axis of the 

pump, said angle being preferably comprised between 1° 
and 15°.

getter material is a metal selected from zirconium, 

titanium, hafnium, tantalum, thorium, uranium, niobium, 
mixtures and/or alloys thereof and/or with other metals 

and wherein said metal is optionally admixed with antisintering 
agent. 
The pump of claim 5, wherein said non-evaporable 
getter metal is selected from:

getter metal is a combination obtained from: 


I) a ternary particulate Zr-V-Fe non-evaporable getter 
alloy having a composition by weight lying, when 

plotted on a ternary diagram, within a polygon having 
as its corners the following points (% b.w.): 


a) 75% Zr - 20% V - 5% Fe 
b) 45% Zr - 20% V - 35% Fe 
c) 45% Zr - 50% V - 5% Fe 
II) a particulate non-evaporable getter metal, selected 
from Zr and Ti, wherein the Zr and/or Ti particles
