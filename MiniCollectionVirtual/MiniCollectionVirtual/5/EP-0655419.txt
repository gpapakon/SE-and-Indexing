<ABSTRACT>
A process for treating a photographic waste water 
containing a used processing liquid resulting from a 

processing step having a bleaching ability or a fixing 
ability in the processing of a silver halide photographic 

material which process comprises adding a polymer-complex-forming 
agent to the waste water in an amount i
n the range 
of from 0.5 to 4 equivalents to a metal contained in the 

waste water to thereby form a polymer-metal complex and then 
filtering off the polymer-metal complex with a mono-membrane 

filter having a pore size of 0.05 to 10 µm to thereby remove 
the metal. A device for use in practicing the process is 

also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
treating a photographic waste water resulting from the
processing of a silver halide photographic material. More
particularly, the present invention relates to a process for
treating a photographic waste water containing a used
processing chemicals resulting from a processing step having
a bleaching ability or a fixing ability to easily remove a
metal, e.g., silver, from the waste water at low cost with
high removal efficiency.A silver halide photographic material (hereinafter
also referred to as "photographic material") is processed,
after exposure, through the stops of development,
desilvering, washing, stabilizing, etc. In these steps, a
developing bath, a bleaching bath, a bleach-fix bath, a
fixing bath, industrial, municipal or deionized water, and a
stabilizing bath are used to process the photographic
material.Such a processing is usually conducted using a
processing apparatus, e.g., an automatic processor, in which
the photographic material is transferred from one to another
of processing tanks respectively filled with the
aforementioned processing liquids.Of these processing steps, a step having a bleaching 
ability or a fixing ability necessitates a subsequent washing
or stabilizing step or the like in which a fixer ingredient,
the silver complex and other chemiclas generated during
fixing of the silver halide emulsion layers are washed out to
maintain the stability of images. Therefore, those chemicals
are incorporated into processing liquids, such as wash water
and a stabilizing bath, and accumulated to a high
concentration. Examples of such contaminants include silver
complexes from the fixing bath; iron or silver compounds from
the bleach or bleach-fix bath; cerium compounds from a
reducer for photomechanical proces; aluminum compounds from a
hardening fixer.If a waste water containing such contaminants, e.g.,
silver compounds, are discharged directly into a sewer
system, it causes an environmental safety problem.
Particularly, in the United States, Europe, and some areas in
Southeast Asia, regulations for the discharge of sliver
compounds into sewer systems are getting severe in recent
years.The collection and treatment of such waste water is
costly, especially in large-scale photofinishing laboratories
where wash water is used in large quantities. From the
standpoint of resource conservation, the recovery of metals,
e.g., silver, from waste water containing these metals at
especially high concentrations is important. Furthermore, in
most of
