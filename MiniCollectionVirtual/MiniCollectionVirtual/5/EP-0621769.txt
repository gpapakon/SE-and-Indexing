 TRANSDERMAL ADMINISTRATION OF SHORT ORINTERMEDIATE HALF- IFE BENZODIAZEPINESDescriptionTechnical FieldThis invention relates to methods and devices for administering short- and intermediate-acting benzodiazepines, particularly alprazolam and triazolam, transdermally.BackgroundAlprazolam (8-chloro-1-methyl-6-phenyl-4H- l,2,4-triazolo(4,3-a) (1,4) enzodiazepine) is a short to intermediate half-life benzodiazepine drug. It is sold commercially in the U.S. under the brand name Xanax in the form of tablets for treatment of anxiety, depression, and panic disorders. U.S. 3,987,052 describes the preparation and oral administration of alprazolam. It is given orally in doses of 0.25 to 0.5 mg with a maximum dose up to 4 mg for adults. Therapeutic plasma concentrations are typically in the 17 to 30 ng/ml range. (USP Druσ Information for the Health Care Professional, page 595, 10th Ed., 1990.) The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of alprazolam after oral and intravenous administration are reported in J. Clin. Psychiatry (1983)44 (8, Sec. 2) and Psvchopharmacoloσy (1984) 84:452-456.Triazolam (8-chloro-6- (2-chlorophenyl) -1- methyl-4H-l,2,4-triazolo- (4,3-a) -1,4-benzodiazepine is a short half-life benzodiazepine drug. It is sold 

 commercially in the U.S. under the brand name Halcion in the form of oral tablets for treatment of insomnia. It is given orally at doses of 125-250 μg.Japanese Pat. Pub. 61254519 describes formula- 5 tions of drugs with polyvinyl acetate and sulfoxides such as dimethylsulfoxide for transdermal administration. The publication suggests administering benzodiazepines from such formulations but does not mention alprazolam or triazolam. Similarly, Japanese Pat. Pub. 61033129 10 describes pharmaceutical formulations of various drugs in sesquiterpene alcohol and a polar compound for transder¬ mal administration. It, too, mentions benzodiazepines but says nothing about alprazolam or triazolam.The present invention is directed to achieving 15 noninvasive sustained administration of short and intermediate half-life benzodiazepines, particularly alprazolam or triazolam, at therapeutically effective levels by delivering them in combination with a skin permeation enhancer transdermally. 20.Disclosure of the InventionAccordingly, one aspect of the invention is a method for providing short or intermediate half-life benzodiazepine therapy to an individual in need of such 5 therapy comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of said benzodiazepine to the individual transdermally

<CLAIMS>
CLAIMS
1. A method for providing short or intermediate half-life benzodiazepine therapy to a human patient in need of such therapy comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of the benzodiazepine to the patient transdermally through a predetermined area of skin over a sustained time period at a controlled rate in combination with a sufficient amount of a permeation enhancer to enable the benzodiazepine to permeate the area of skin at a rate in excess of about one μg/cm
2
/hr.
2. The method of claim l wherein the benzodiazepine is alprazolam and the alprazolam is administered at a rate of about 0.75 to 6 mg/day.
3. The method of claim 1 wherein the benzodiazepine is triazolam and the triazolam is administered at a rate of 0.1 to 1.0 mg/day.
4. The method of claim 1 wherein the benzodiazepine is alprazolam or triazolam and the enhancer is propylene glycol monolaurate, glyceryl monooleate, lauryl alcohol, mixed vegetable oil, or combinations thereof.
5. The method of claim 1 wherein the area of skin is 20 to 60 cm
2
 , the benzodiazepine is alprazolam and the alprazolam is administered at a rate of at least about 100 μg/hr.
6. A laminated composite for administering a short or intermediate half-life benzodiazepine to an 


 individual transdermally through a predetermined area of skin comprising: a) a backing layer that is substantially impermeable to the benzodiazepine; and b) a reservoir layer comprising a solvent- based acrylate adhesive polymer, the benzodiazepine dissolved in said polymer, and a permeation enhancer that increases the permeability of the skin to the benzodiazepine dissolved in said polymer, the basal surface of said reservoir layer being adapted to be adhered to said area of skin and wherein the amounts of the benzodiazepine and enhancer in said reservoir layer are sufficient to enable a therapeutically effective amount of the benzodiazepine to be administered at a rate in excess of about one μg/cm
2
/hr to the individual through said predetermined area of skin over a sustained time period.
7. The laminated composite of claim 6 wherein the benzodiazepine is alprazolam or triazolam and the permeation enhancer is propylene glycol monolaurate, glyceryl monooleate, lauryl alcohol, mixed vegetable oil, or combinations thereof.
8. The laminated composite of claim 6 wherein the benzodiazepine constitutes 1 to 10% by weight of the reservoir lamina and the permeation enhancer constitutes 2 to 20% by weight of the reservoir lamina.
