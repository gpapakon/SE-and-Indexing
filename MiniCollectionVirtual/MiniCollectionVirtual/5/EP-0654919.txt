<ABSTRACT>
In an information transfer system formed with a terminal and a portable data medium arrangement, authentication of one participant by another participant takes place according to the challenge-and-response principle. The portable data medium arrangement is formed with a value memory, a monitoring device assigned to the latter and a non-volatile, limitable error counter. In the authentication method, a restriction for the performance of computing operations is first set up in the portable data medium arrangement and this can only be cancelled through modification of the error counter reading. Random data are transmitted as challenge data from the terminal to the portable data medium arrangement after the error counter reading has been incremented and the restriction has been cancelled. In both the terminal and the portable data medium arrangement, authentication parameters AP3, AP4 are calculated in each case from the challenge data with the aid of at least one algorithm and secret key data. The terminal transmits its authentication parameters AP3 as a response to the portable data medium arrangement where they are compared with the authentication parameters AP4 calculated there. If the respective authentication parameters AP3, AP4 correspond, the value memory can be reloaded and/or the error counter reset.
