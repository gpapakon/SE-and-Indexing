<ABSTRACT>
A charge plate structure for use in a 
continuous ink jet printer is provided with a 

protective layer of adhesively bonded polyimide film. 
The charge plate is fabricated by forming a substrate 

having charging electrodes along one edge and 
corresponding conductive leads on one surface. The 

surface of the charge plate is precleaned and the 
polyimide film is laminated thereto by means of heat 

and pressure. The resulting charge plate exhibits 
improved adhesion and protection from ink.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
continuous ink jet printers and, more particularly,
to improved constructions for the charge plate
structure in such printers.In continuous ink jet printing,
electrically conductive ink is supplied under
pressure to a manifold region that distributes the
ink to a plurality of orifices, typically arranged in
a linear array(s). The ink discharges from the
orifices in filaments which break into droplet
streams. Individual droplet streams are selectively
charged in the region of the break off from the
filaments and charge drops are deflected from their
normal trajectories. The deflected drops may be
caught and recirculated, and the undeflected drops
allowed to proceed to a print receiving medium.Drops are charged by a charge plate
having a plurality of charging electrodes along one
edge, and a corresponding plurality of connecting
leads along one surface. The edge of the charge
plate having the charging electrodes is placed in
close proximity to the break off point of the ink jet
filaments, and charges applied to the leads to induce
charges in the drops as they break off from the
filaments.U.S. Patent No. 4,560,991, issued
December 24, 1985, to W. Shutrum, describes one
method of fabricating a charge plate for an ink jet
printer. The charge plate taught by Shutrum is
fabricated by electro-depositing the charging
electrodes and leads on a flat sheet of etchable 
material, such as copper foil, to form a so-called
"coupon." The coupon is bent in a jig at
approximately a 90°angle. The leads are then bonded
to a charge plate substrate, and the etchable
material is removed.In the prior art, charge plates are
presently coated with multiple wet layers, such as a
photoresist available as KTFR Photoresist from Union
Carbide Corporation, lacquers, and epoxies. Such
coatings provide insufficient protection of the
charge leads as compared to a solid layer of
polyimide. Wet coatings are prone to pinholing, and
marginal adhesion, are not easily controllable and
have erratic results. Coatings applied by wet
methods inherently form an uneven interface at the
leading edge of the coating on the charge plate
surface where the conductors form a 90° angle.One method for solving this problem is
disclosed in commonly assigned pending application
U.S. Serial No. 857,852, which teaches coating the
conductive lead surface of a charge plate with a two-part
epoxy. Although epoxy such as EPO-TEK 353ND
from Epoxy Technologies, Billerica, Massachusetts, is
shown to be resistent to some ink jet inks, the
