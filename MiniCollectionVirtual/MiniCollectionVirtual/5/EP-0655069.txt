<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of
biologically compatible surfactants, comprising amphiphilic
structures derived from biological molecules. It relates
particularly to amphiphilic derivatives of amino acids or
of peptides, useful in drug preparations or in cosmetic
formulations.Amphiphilic amino acid and peptide derivatives have
surfactant properties that make them utilizable, alone or
with other substances, as emulsifiers or co-emulsifiers, as
dispersants or solubilizers, as modifiers of natural or
synthetic membranes or in forming drug vehicles or
targeting devices. Some of them are capable of forming
vesicles (a structure equivalent to that of the liposomes
obtained from phospholipids).A drug vehicle provides advantages in therapy, among
them prolonged intravascular persistence and a controlled
release of the drug, resulting in greater efficacy and
reduced doses, which is of great importance when the drug
is toxic or provokes side effects. The pharmacokinetics
and biodistribution of the encapsulated drug are determined
by the drug vehicle, and thus on the structure of the
molecules that compose this vesicle. Thus, in order to
enhance the specificity of the vesicles for targeting
cells, derivatives of carbohydrates are incorporated in
vesicles containing an imaging agent or a therapeutic agent
(see Liposome Technology, Targeted Drug Delivery and
Biological Interaction, Vol. III, G. Gregoriadis ed., CRC
Press, Inc., 1984).In preferred embodiments, the present invention
deals with new amphiphiles that can be used as drug
vehicles and for the specific targeting of a drug by virtue
of a terminal sugar group which is recognized by specific 
receptor on the cell membrane. The new amphiphiles
comprise a carbohydrate part and a peptidic spacer between
the hydrophilic saccharidic head and the hydrocarbon and/or
fluorocarbon hydrophobic tail. Hydrocarbon molecules with
a sugar head have been described by Okahaya et al (J. Chem.
Soc. Perkins Trans. 2 (1987) p. 1317), but they do not bear
a peptidic spacer. Amphiphilic compounds derived from
sugars and bearing a fluorocarbon chain, but with no
peptidic spacer, have been described in EP-A-0255443.US-A-2785152 discloses N-aldonyl amino acid esters,
e.g. N-lactobionyl stearyl polyglycyl glycinate. Such
compounds include a single alkyl group with at least 12
carbon atoms. They may be useful as emulsifiers.A. Yekta Özer et al., Eur J Pharm. Biopharm., 37(2)
1991, 75-79 discloses the use of lipophilic ethers and
esters of sugars and polyols for the
