<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus (20) for preventing double feed, comprising means (22) for retaining a flat object which may be entrained by friction by another flat object which is itself entrained in a predetermined transfer direction on one of its sides by transfer means (16). The retention means (22) are mounted on a structure (8) which is movable in a direction substantially perpendicular to the transfer direction. The separator apparatus (20) also comprises means (27) for exerting a holding force on the retention means (22), this holding force being oriented in a holding direction substantially perpendicular to the transfer direction. Use for automatic sorting of mail, particularly envelopes of variable thickness.

Double pick separator device (20) comprising means (22) for
retaining a flat object (6) which might otherwise be entrained by

friction by another flat object (5) being moved in a predetermined
transfer direction (Dt) by transfer means (16, 5), said retaining

means (22) being mounted on a structure (8) mobile in a direction

(Dm) substantially perpendicular to the transfer direction (Dt), the
device further comprising means (27) for exerting a holding force

(Fm) on the retaining means (22), said holding force (Fm) being
oriented in a holding direction (Dm) substantially perpendicular to

the transfer direction (Dt), the device being characterized in that
it further comprises conduction means (37) having a first part (31)

oriented along a first axis substantially parallel to the holding
direction (Dm) and having at its end a suction head (22) and a second

part (32) oriented along a second axis substantially perpendicular to
the first axis and having its end (39) connected by flexible

conduction means (43) to suction generator means (34), said second
part (32) being fastened to an abutment (33) mobile relative to a

frame plane (38, 48).
Separator device (20) according to claim 1, characterized in
that the mobile structure (8) comprises a first arm (21) connected by

first articulation means (28) to a frame (18) and a second arm (19)
connected by second articulation means (29) to the first arm (21),

said second arm (19) carrying the retaining means (22) and being held
substantially parallel to the transfer direction (Dt).
Separator device (20) according to claim 2, characterized in
that the first and second articulation means (28, 29) have axes

substantially perpendicular to the transfer direction (Dt) and to the
holding direction (Dm).
Separator device (20) according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the holding means comprise a spring,

for example a torsion spring (27). 
Separator device (40) according to claim 1, characterized in
that the second part (32) of the rigid conduction means (37) is

guided by guide means (41, 42) fixed relative to the frame plane
(48).
Flat object unstacking device (10) comprising flat object feed
means (14, 13), flat object holding means (17), a double pick

separator device (20) according to any one of the preceding claims
and transfer means (16), characterized in that the separator device

(20) is in the immediate vicinity of the holding means (17) and the
transfer means (16) and in that the retaining means (22) are

controlled in such a way that a retaining force is generated each
time an object (5) is entrained by the transfer means (16).
