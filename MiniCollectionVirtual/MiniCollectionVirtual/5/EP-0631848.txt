<ABSTRACT>
A hand-held blast cleaning machine (10) having a 
motor (30) which serves as a handle. The machine includes a blast 

assembly (12) for propelling abrasive material against a surface (16) 
and a hopper (14) for supplying abrasive material to the blast 

assembly (12). The blast assembly has a blast corridor (20), a rebound 
corridor (24), a blast opening (22), a blast wheel (26) and a motor (30). 

The 
motor (30) drives the rotation of the blast wheel and serves as a 

handle. The hopper (14) has a return corridor (52), a collection 
area (38), 

a feed area (36) and a vacuum conduit (56). The vacuum conduit is 
connected to a vacuum source (58) to collect dust and debris from 

the blast cleaning operation. In one embodiment, an side-blast 
hopper (14A), a down-blast hopper (14B), an up-blast hopper (14C) and a 

side-feed hopper (14D) are all interchangeably attachable to the 
same blast assembly (12). A shut-off handle (80) is attached to the 

blast assembly to provide automatic shut-off abrasive material 
to the blast 
wheel (26) and to function as a second handle. In 
another embodiment, the motor (30E) serves as the only handle. A 

linear actuator connected to a feed valve in the hopper 
provides automatic shut-off of abrasive material to the blast 

wheel.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to 
blast cleaning machines, and particularly to, but not by way 
of limitation, to hand-held blast cleaning machines. Various machines for blast cleaning surfaces 
are known in the art. For example, U. S. Patent No. 3,034,262 
issued to Pawlson discloses a resurfacing and finishing 
machine. The Pawlson machine has no mechanism for 
automatically blocking the flow of abrasive material when the 
machine is intentionally or accidentally released. Moreover, 
the Pawlson machine has no air wash for removing dust and 
debris from the abrasive material. Another example is U. S. Patent No. 3,900,969, 
issued to Diehn and disclosing a portable apparatus for blast 
cleaning. The Diehn apparatus is not designed to be hand-held. 
In fact, it is so unwieldy that it is supported on 
casters. In addition, the Diehn apparatus may only be used 
on surfaces which are somewhat vertically disposed in order 
for the hopper to gravity feed abrasive material to the blast 
wheel. A third example of related art is U. S. Patent 
No. 4,020,596, which is issued to Bergh and discloses a 
convertible blast cleaning unit. The Bergh unit has modules 
for converting the unit between side-blasting mode and up-blasting 
mode. The Bergh unit is designed for cleaning large 
areas, such as the hulls of ships. Accordingly, the Bergh 
machine is not suitable for use as a hand-held device. 
Because only up-blasting and side-blasting are required for 
cleaning the hull of a ship, the Bergh unit is not designed 
for conversion to blast downward. One aspect of this invention comprises a hand-held 
apparatus for blast cleaning a surface, the apparatus  
 
comprising: a housing having a blast corridor, a rebound 
corridor and a blast opening communicating with the blast 
corridor and the rebound corridor; a blast wheel mounted 
within said housing, said blast wheel being adapted for 
rotating and propelling abrasive material through the blast 
corridor and blast opening against a surface to be cleaned; 
at least one hopper attached to said housing and having a 
return corridor, said hopper communicating with the blast 
corridor to provide abrasive material to said blast wheel and 
the return corridor of said hopper communicating with the 
rebound corridor of said housing to receive spent abrasive 
material and means for rotating said blast wheel. The present invention is a hand-held blast 
cleaning machine comprising a blast assembly and a hopper. 
The blast assembly has a blast opening and a blast

<CLAIMS>
A hand-held apparatus for blast cleaning a 
surface, the apparatus comprising: 

   a housing having a blast corridor, a rebound 
corridor and a blast opening communicating 

with the blast corridor and the rebound 
corridor; 

   a blast wheel mounted within said housing, said 
blast wheel being adapted for rotating and 

propelling abrasive material through the blast 
corridor and blast opening against a surface 

to be cleaned; 
   at least one hopper attached to said housing and 

having a return corridor, said hopper 
communicating with the blast corridor to 

provide abrasive material to said blast wheel 
and the return corridor of said hopper 

communicating with the rebound corridor of 
said housing to receive spent abrasive 

material; and 
   means for rotating said blast wheel. 
The apparatus of claim 1 wherein said at least 
one hopper is removably attached to said housing in a position 

to gravity feed abrasive material to said blast wheel when the 
blast opening is disposed generally sideways, downward or 

upward. 
The apparatus of claim 2 wherein there are 
   three hoppers alternately attachable to said 

housing, each one of said hoppers having a 
return corridor communicating with the rebound
