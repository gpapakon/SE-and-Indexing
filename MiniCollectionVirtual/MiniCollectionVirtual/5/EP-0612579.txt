<ABSTRACT>
Brazing copper- or iron-based alloy articles 
containing aluminium, titanium, or zirconium using a 

high temperature solder is made possible by using a 
non-deliquescent flux, especially under an inert gas 

atmosphere. Flux residues are non-corrosive and 
minimal, and need not be washed off after brazing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods for brazing 
metallic alloys containing readily oxidisable components 
such as aluminium, titanium and zirconium. Copper and iron based alloys containing aluminium, 
titanium, zirconium and other such readily oxidisable 
components are now widely used throughout industry, 
owing to their useful properties. However, alloys containing such readily oxidisable 
components are difficult to braze by standard 
techniques, as they tend to be covered with a layer of 
oxide. Conventional brazing techniques require a flux in 
conjunction with high temperature alloys, and such 
fluxes characteristically comprise chloride compounds. 
The chlorides used tend to be deliquescent, and must be 
used in large quantities. Accordingly, it is necessary 
to remove the flux after the brazing operation in order 
to prevent any unnecessary oxidation which might occur 
in the presence of deliquescing water. The removal of 
the used flux is difficult and requires the use of large 
quantities of water. Cleaning the waste water presents 
its own problems. EP-A-140267 describes the brazing of aluminium based 
articles using fluoride based solders. However, such 
articles are brazed at low temperatures, where 
oxidisation during brazing is not a problem. Thus, there is a requirement for a technique for the 
brazing of alloys containing readily oxidised materials 
wherein the flux which is used does not need to be 
washed off, and only needs to be used in small 
quantities. We have now found that it is possible to overcome 
the above problems by using a fluoride flux, together 
with a high temperature solder.  
 Thus, in a first aspect, there is provided a method 
for the brazing of a copper or iron based alloy 
containing one or more readily oxidisable components, 
such as aluminium, titanium and/or zirconium, said 
method comprising using a high temperature solder and a 
flux, characterised in that the flux is non-deliquescent, 
has a melting point of 600째C or higher, 
and comprises fluorides, or fluorine based compounds. The fluxes of the invention should preferably 
contain no chlorides. If chlorides are present, then 
they should be present only in small amounts, preferably 
only in trace amounts, and particularly preferably none 
at all. The flux will usually be prepared as a slurry 
with water before use but, before the addition of water, 
it is preferred that the flux consists essentially of a 
fluoride. Particularly preferred fluorides are 
Na3AlF6 and Li3AlF6. It is especially
