<ABSTRACT>
Methods and devices for the diagnosis, evaluation 
and treatment of coronary artery disease (CAD) by means of a 

closed loop drug delivery system that delivers a catecholamine 
exercise simulating agent, some of which are novel, which 

elicit both acute and adaptive cardiovascular responses 
similar to those elicited by aerobic activity are provided. 

The acute responses to the exercise simulating agent are 
used to diagnose and evaluate CAD in lieu of the acute 

responses to aerobic exercise. Due to their adaptive 
responses these compounds may be used to treat CAD in lieu 

of the adaptive responses caused by aerobic exercise 
training or to treat other conditions which the adaptive 

responses caused by aerobic exercise are desirable.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present application is divided from application 
no. 89301553.7 filed 17 February 1989. The present invention is directed to a novel exercise 
simulating agent and to therapeutic agents having both 
acute and adaptive cardiovascular and metabolic effects. The exercise simulating agent elicits both acute and 
adaptive cardiovascular responses similar to those 
resulting from aerobic activity and is therefore useful in 
the diagnosis, evaluation and treatment of coronary artery 
disease and more specifically in a system for closed loop 
delivery of an exercise simulating agent. Publications and other reference materials referred 
herein are numerically referenced in the following text and 
respectively grouped in the appended Bibliography which 
immediately precedes the claims. The drugs described and claimed herein that elicit 
acute and adaptive cardiovascular response similar to the 
types of responses elicited by aerobic activity are 
referred to as Exercise Simulating Agent Beta Agonists 
(hereinafter "exercise simulating agents" or "ESA™ beta 
agonists") for the purposes of  
 
this invention. While eliciting such cardiovascular responses, 
it has been discovered that the effects of administration of ESA™ 
beta agonists can be finely controlled so that the heart is 
exercised or stressed at selected levels without body motion. According to the American Heart Association, heart 
disease, stroke and related disorders accounted for nearly one 
million deaths in 1984, almost as many deaths as from all other 
causes of deaths combined. Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular 
diseases affect over 63 million people in the United States, 
equivalent to one of every four Americans. Approximately 5 
million people in the United States suffer from coronary artery 
disease (hereinafter "CAD"), resulting in over 1.5 million heart 
attacks yearly, of which 550,000 are fatal. The annual economic 
cost of cardiovascular disease alone is estimated to be $85 
billion. Cardiovascular disease has many manifestations, of 
course, including atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is the most common form of 
arteriosclerosis, commonly referred to as "hardening of the 
arteries." Atherosclerosis is a degenerative process that 
narrows or blocks arteries in the heart, brain and other parts of 
the body; the interior walls of the arteries become lined with 
deposits of fat, cholesterol, fibrin, cellular waste products and 
calcium. These deposits form a rough, thick surface inside the 
blood vessels, and interfere with both the
