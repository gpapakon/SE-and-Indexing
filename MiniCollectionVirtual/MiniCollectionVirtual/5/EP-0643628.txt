<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a fixed-angle centrifuge
rotor according to the precharacterizing portion of claim 1
and a method for fabricating a fixed-angle centrifuge rotor
according to the precharacterizing portion of claim 8.This invention relates generally to centrifuge
rotors, and relates more particularly to a fixed-angle
rotor fabricated and reinforced with composite
materials.Centrifuges are commonly used in medical and
biological research for separating and purifying
materials of differing densities, such as viruses,
bacteria, cells, protein, and other compositions. A
centrifuge includes a rotor typically capable of
spinning at tens of thousands of revolutions per
minute.There are two major types of centrifuge rotors,
continuous flow rotors and preparative rotors. A
continuous flow rotor has a large central cavity to
accept the sample, which is pumped into the central
cavity. Separated fluids are continuously pumped out
of a continuous flow rotor. This type of rotor
constitutes a small portion of the market.The other type of centrifuge rotor is a
preparative rotor, which is the subject of this
patent application. A preparative centrifuge rotor
has some means for accepting tubes or bottles
containing the samples to be centrifuged.
Preparative rotors are commonly classified according
to the orientation of the sample tubes or bottles.
Vertical tube rotors carry the sample tubes or
bottles in a vertical orientation, parallel to the
vertical rotor axis. Fixed-angle rotors carry the
sample tubes or bottles at an angle inclined with
respect to the rotor axis, with the bottoms of the
sample tubes being inclined away from the rotor axis 
so that centrifugal force during centrifugation
forces the sample toward the bottom of the sample
tube or bottle. Swinging bucket rotors have pivoting
tube carriers that are upright when the rotor is
stopped and that pivot the bottoms of the tubes
outward under centrifugal force.Many centrifuge rotors are fabricated from
metal. Since weight is concern, titanium and
aluminum are commonly used materials for metal
centrifuge rotors.Fiber-reinforccd, composite structures have also
been used for centrifuge rotors. Composite
centrifuge rotors are typically made from laminated
layers of carbon fibers embedded in an epoxy resin
matrix. The fibers are arranged in multiple layers
extending in varying directions at right angles to
the rotor axis. During fabrication of such a rotor,
the carbon fibers and resin matrix are cured under
high pressure and temperature to produce a
