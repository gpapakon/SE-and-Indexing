<ABSTRACT>
The amount of particulate matter that is forced 
into the passenger compartment of an automobile by the 

deployment of an air bag as it protects the lives of 
occupants is reduced by improving the filterability of the 

combustion products of a composition for generating gas to 
inflate the bag. The filterability is improved by adding a 

nucleating agent for alkali metal halide vapors formed 
during said combustion. Silica, alumina, and graphite are 

representative of the nucleating agents.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to improved filterability 
of the combustion products of a gas generating composition 
comprised of polyvinyl chloride and inorganic oxidizer 
salts. More particularly, it relates to a gas generating 
composition for use in the inflation of devices such as air 
bags, escape chutes, and life rafts. It is particularly 
directed to a method for improving the filterability of 
such gases during the inflation of air bags used in 
passenger vehicles to restrain the movement of passengers 
in the event of a crash. Inflation of such devices is generally accomplished 
by the controlled decomposition of sodium azide or other 
azo compounds which releases large volumes of nitrogen gas, 
and by the release of a gas such as air, nitrogen, carbon 
dioxide, helium, argon, and the like from pressure vessels. 
Hybrid gas generators combine the stored gas and high 
temperature combustion product gases from the burning of 
gas generating compositions. U. S. Patent Nos. 3,155,749; 
3,723,205; and 4,981,534 (which are incorporated herein by 
reference) describe formulations for gas generating 
compositions which are used primarily in hybrid systems. 
Said formulations comprise a vinyl chloride polymer as the 
binder and fuel, a plasticizer, an oxidizer, a hydrogen 
chloride scavenger, a stabilizer for the polymer, a 
catalyst, and coolants. The hydrogen chloride scavenger is 
a halogen-free alkali metal salt. The alkali metal 
chlorides formed by the scavenging are extremely difficult 
to filter out of the combustion product gas before it 
enters the deploying air bag. At the combustion  
 
temperature of these compositions (on the order of 2800°K 
or about 2500°C and about 4600°F), the chlorides are all in 
the vapor phase. This fact essentially means that the 
filtration of such chlorides from the gas depends on the 
condensation of the vapors on the cold metal surfaces of 
the gas generator device. An object of this invention, therefore, is to 
provide a polyvinyl chloride/inorganic oxidizer-based gas 
generating composition for inflatable devices which 
intrinsically causes an increase of the amount of 
filterable solid products of the combustion as compared 
with that of the prior art. A related object of the invention is to provide 
nucleation sites within the gas generated by the 
composition for vaporized, normally solid products of the 
combustion of the composition. A further related object of the invention is to 
provide a method for improving the filterability of 
combustion products of a
