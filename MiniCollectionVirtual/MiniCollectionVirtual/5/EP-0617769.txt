<ABSTRACT>
A compression spring (14) formed of an elastomer having a ratio of plastic strain to elastic strain that is greater than 1.5 to 1 and formed into a spherical body (22) having cone frustums (24) at end to provide for a substantially constant spring rate over a major portion of its displacement. The spring is precompressed to overcome the compression set characteristics of the elastomer and to orient its molecular structure. The spring is particularly useful as a bumper spring for an automotive vehicle.

<DESCRIPTION>
 "ELASTOMER BUMPER SPRING" BACKGROUND OF INVENTIONField of Invention. This invention relates to elastomeric compression springs. Th preferred embodiment of our invention is primarily directed to a compression spring for th bumper assembly of an automobile.The automotive and insurance industries have long sought a bumper assembly tha would absorb the energy of a collision at speeds of 5 miles an hour or less. Th acceptability of these units is evaluated by two different criteria. The first is the "no visibl damage" criteria. On belief, existing hydraulic bumper assemblies generally meet thi criteria, Le., they protect the vehicle from visible damage. The second is the "no dolla damage" criteria. On belief, the presently used hydraulic units cannot consistently meet the latter criteria. Either the bumper assembly itself or other parts of the automobile suffer functional damage from collisions at 5 mph. Moreover, such bumper assemblies are comprised of a plurality of parts that add undesirable weight, impose assembly costs, require separate, preload springs to minimize vibration, and do not provide a generally constant spring rate.Related Art. Numerous efforts have been made to design a bumper spring for automobiles that would meet the industry goals and criteria. These efforts include U.S. Patent No. 4,893,857 which issued to General Motors Corporation on an application o Bobinger, et. aL This device of General Motors includes a cylindrical tube containing a first energy absorbing medium, a preload unit comprised of a compression spring and disks and a telescoping piston tube that extends to the bumper. One energy absorbing medium described by General Motors is a thermoplastic material such as Hytrel®, a copolymer elastomer manufactured by E.I. duPont de Nemoirs which has a very high compression set characteristic and which, in part, necessitates the preload assembly to insure that the bumper assembly returns to its original position after a collision. 

 Another prior effort to design a bumper spring is illustrated by U.S. Patent 4,624 which issued to Chrysler Motors Corporation on an application of Hillebrand, et. al the General Motors patent, the Chrysler patent also includes a plurality of parts, Le., a l bearing tube member with an abutment, a reaction coil spring for preload and an en absorbing capsule containing the Hytrel® copolymer elastomer of E.I. duPont de Nem Additional prior art related to the present invention is U.S. Patent No. 4,566, which issued to Miner Enterprises, Inc. on an

We claim:
1. A compression spring comprising: a) a hollow spring member formed of an elastomer having a ratio of plastic s to elastic strain that is greater than 1.5 to 1, the molecular structure said me being oriented as a result of plastic deformation of said member in at least direction; b) said spring member having a spherical segment member whose ends term in a transition means having an angle which is generally tangent to the ends o spherical segment for providing a relatively constant spring rate over a substa portion of the compression of said spring; c) said spring having means for interconnection between two members for absor energy upon the application of force to one of said members; and d) said spring having a relatively constant spring rate over a substantial porti . its compressive displacement.
2. A compression spring as recited in claim 1 in which said transition means tak shape of at least one cone shaped frustum.
3. A compression spring as recited in claim 1 in which the spring member has deformed by compression by at least 30% of its length so as to overcome compression set characteristic of the elastomer, to orient its molecular structure to provide for the relatively constant spring rate.

 4. In a vehicle bumper assembly, a compression spring interconnected between the vehicle and its associated bumper, said spring comprising: a) a hollow spring member formed of an elastomer having a ratio of plastic strain to elastic strain that is greater than 1.5 to 1, the molecular structure said member being oriented as a result of plastic deformation of said member in at least one direction; b) said spring member having the shape of a spherical segment with extended ends providing for a relatively constant spring rate over a substantial portion of the compression of said spring.
5. A compression spring as recited in claim 3 in which said extended ends comprise cone shaped frustums extending at an acute angle which is generally tangent to the ends of said spherical segment.
6. A preform for a compression spring comprising: a) a generally cylindrical body formed of an elastomer having a ratio of plastic strain to elastic strain that is greater than 1.5 to 1; b) cone shape frustums extending at an angle from each end of said cylindrical body; and c) attaching means for mounting said compression spring between two structural members.
