<ABSTRACT>
An instrument for detecting the presence of a body, comprising a detector (2) and a housing (1) in which the detector (2) is accommodated. The housing (1) is provided with at least one guide passage (6) for transmission to the detector (2) of one or more signals originating from the body. The housing (1) is also provided with means for supplying a gas flow (8), for example, compressed air, and a means for discharging at least a part of said flow through the guide passage (6) in such a way that, during operation, at least a part of the cleaning gas leaves the housing (1) via the transmission passage (6). At the same time the invention relates to a rolling mill provided with means for determining velocities of the products to be rolled. The means for determining recording velocity comprises at least two of the instruments above and a processing unit which is linked to receive the signals from those instruments for ascertaining the velocity of a product detected by the instruments.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an instrument for detecting the 
presence of a body, comprising a detector and a housing in which the 
detector is accommodated. One known type of instrument is based on the principle of 
thermal radiation detection from a body. However, detection methods 
using other wave ranges are also known. Such a device comprises a 
housing provided with a least a transmission passage aimed in the 
direction of the body to be detected suitable for guiding to the 
detector one or more signals originating from the body. An instrument 
of this type is used in the practice of continuous casting. Applications 
in rolling mill installations are also known. Also applications 
in the field of measuring temperatures in hostile environments are 
known. Reference is made to US-A-5,000,580 and DE-C-895,161. US-A-5,000,580 
discloses a radiation pyrometer suitable for detecting the 
presence of a body, which basically comprises a detector (1) in a 
housing having a guide passage for transmission of radiation from the 
body to be detected, and is equiped with a gas purge system for 
directing cleansing gas (air) onto a lens and down the guide. At the 
distal end of the guide an additonal gas injection system is arranged 
of which one part defines a conduit about the end of said guide, and 
another part defines a slot from which gas (air) is discharged into the 
conduit away from the housing and about the guide passage. A similar configuration is disclosed in DE-C-895,161. Whereas in 
US-A-5,000,580 both purge and injection system are provided with  
 
pressurized gas, in DE-C-895,161 injection of gas takes place only via 
a separate inlet of the additonal injection system resulting in suction 
of gas through the purge system. Further prior art (US-A-4,738,528) shows a method of cleaning a 
pyrometer lens by directing purge aire spirally inward over the lens 
surface such that a vortex is formed by the spiral air flow to increase 
effectivity of the cleaning action. US-A-4,784,491 teaches the application of pitched grooves or 
screw threads in the walls of a gas channel to induce a swirling flow 
to protect optics against debris and moving particles in the air. GB-A-1,114,682 proposes the application of a head for a 
detection instrument, including tangential gas inlet for supply of 
cleaning gas along the sight-way of the instrument. In this application the instrument serves to detect the presence 
of a slab to be rolled out for purposes such as bringing the mill 
stands of the rolling mill up to the

<CLAIMS>
An instrument for detecting the presence of a body, comprising a 
detector (2) and a housing (1), in which the detector (2) is 

accommodated, said housing (1) being provided with at least one 
guide passage (6) for transmission to the detector (2) of 

signals from the body, and with means for supplying a gas 
flow (8), and means for directing at least a part of said flow 

through the guide passage (6) such that, during operation, at 
least a part of the gas flow leaves the housing (1) via the 

guide passage (6), and further comprising a device (10) 
comprising an inner element (11) providing a central throughflow 

conduit (15) surrounding the guide passage (6) or an extension 
of the discharge flow path therefrom, and an outer element (12) 

at least partially arranged about the inner element (11), said 
elements cooperating in defining a slot (13) for discharge of 

gas into said conduit (15) in a direction away from the 
housing (1) and around said passage (6) or said extension, 

characterised in that it is provided with a centrifugal 
separator (5) for separating the gas into a clean and a polluted 

fraction, and with said gas supplying means (8) being connected 
close to the outer periphery of the centrifugal separator (5), 

the centre of the separator (5) being connected to said guide 
(6) by said directing means (9) so as to supply said clean 

fraction to said guide (6), and said separator (5) furthermore 
being connected to said conduit (15) by connecting means 

(14,16,17) so as to supply said polluted fraction to said 
conduit (15).  

 
An instrument according to claim 1, wherein the centrifugal 
separator (5) is provided adjacent its centre with deflector 

means (9) positioned transverse to the direction of flow of the 
gas for reducing the rotational flow energy of the gas.
