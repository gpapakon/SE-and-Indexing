<ABSTRACT>
An aqueous adhesive composition containing a chlorosulfonated polyethylene latex, a polymaleimide compound, a nitroso compound and a metal oxide. The adhesive composition can be effectively utilized without a primer component and exhibits an unusually high resistance to pre-bake conditions and adverse environments. The adhesive also possesses the ability to effectively bond a variety of substrates.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the bonding of various
substrates to surfaces such as ferrous and non-ferrous metal
surfaces. More specifically, the present invention relates to a one-component,
aqueous adhesive composition based on a chlorosulfonated
polyethylene latex and a polymaleimide compound.In an effort to keep pace with increasingly demanding bonding
conditions and to comply with the numerous circumscribing
environmental regulations, much of the research in the adhesives
field is currently being directed towards developing a robust adhesive
that can be applied as an aqueous formulation so as to avoid the use of
volatile solvents. The fruits of these research efforts can be seen in
recently issued U.S. Patent Nos. 4,988,753 and 5,036,122. U.S. Patent
No. 4,988,753 describes an aqueous dispersion for bonding natural and
synthetic elastomers to metallic and non-metallic substrates under
vulcanizing conditions. The adhesive composition contains a mixture
of chlorosulfonated polyethylene and vinyl chloride/vinylidene
chloride/acrylic acid copolymer, an organic polynitroso compound,
and a coreactive compound selected from diallyl acrylamide and
phenylene bis-maleic acid imide. The adhesive composition may 
optionally contain other additives such as metal oxides, lead salts, and
peroxides.U.S. Patent No. 5,036,122 describes an aqueous adhesive
composition containing a latex of a polymerized conjugated diene, a
poly-C-nitroso compound, and a polymaleimide compound which is a
polymer of a bis-maleimide. The polymerized conjugated diene is
preferably poly-2,3-dichlorobutadiene or poly-1,1,2-trichlorobutadiene.
The adhesive may optionally contain additives such as carbon black,
metallic oxides, and surfactants.U.S. Patent No. 4,119,587 describes an adhesive composition
containing a halogen-containing polyolefin, an aromatic nitroso
compound, and a lead salt. The composition may optionally contain a
maleimide compound. The use of a volatile organic solvent is also
disclosed.Many previously developed adhesive compositions such as the
composition disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,119,587 described above
require the use of an organic solvent and/or the use of a lead salt, both
of which can be detrimental to the environment. Also, many
previously developed aqueous adhesive compositions such as those
disclosed above require the use of an additional adhesive component,
such as a primer component, in order to attain acceptable adhesive
performance levels. A primer component is particularly needed in
rubber-to-metal
