<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides novel immunotoxins and methods of treating neoplastic diseases. These immunotoxins are comprised of a conjugation of an antigen binding region exhibiting binding specificity for the CD33 protein and a cell growth modulator. The immunotoxins of the present invention specifically and selectively kill tumor cells that are characterized by the expression of CD33 antigen. Thus, the novel immunotoxins would be useful in treating human leukemias, both acute and chronic, and other myelodysplastic syndromes.

 IMMUNOTOXINS DIRECTED AGAINST CD33RELATED SURFACE ANTIGENSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the InventionThe present invention relates generally to the field of treatment of neoplastic disease. More specifically, the present invention relates to novel immunoconjugates and their use in the treatment of . neoplastic disease. Even more particularly, the present invention relates to novel immunoconjugates cytotoxic to leukemia cells characterized by expression of the CD33 antigen. Description of the Related ArtNeoplastic disease is one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity in the Western World. All neoplastic diseases or "cancers" share at least one characteristic, i.e., the involvement of defects in the cellular growth regulatory process.Antigens located on the surface of cancer cells have been useful in distinguishing lymphoid from non-lymphoid leukemias, subtyping of acute myelogenous leukemia, predicting therapeutic outcome and in therapy in vivo or via a bone marrow purging ex vivo. Antigens defining acute non-lymphocytic cells also identify normal hematopoietic cells during early stages of their development.CD33 antigen is a 67 kilodalton glycoprotein found on normal colony forming unit granulocyte- monocyte (CFU-GM) , on a fraction of burst-forming unit- erythroid (BFU-E and CFU-granulocyte, erythroid, 

monocyte, megakaryocyte) CFU-GEMM, and absent from normal pluripotent stem cells.Antibodies are proteins normally produced by the immune system of an animal in response to antigenic determinants. Antibodies bind to the specific antigen to which they are directed. The development of specific monoclonal antibodies has provided investigators with a possible means of selectively targeting chemotherapeutic agents to cells which overexpress tumor associated antigens.Immunotoxins are hybrid molecules consisting of a monoclonal antibody covalently linked to a toxin. Immunotoxins have several possible advantages over conventional anti-neoplastic agents including selectivity for tumor cells and potential delivery of extremely potent toxins.The presence of the CD33 antigen on acute non-lymphoid leukemic cells and acute myelogenous leukemic cells presents an opportunity for development of selective immunotoxins. Currently, no such effective immunotoxins exist. Thus, there continues to exist a great need and desire in this art for compounds and methods of selectively killing leukemia cells.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a novel composition comprising a conjugate of an
