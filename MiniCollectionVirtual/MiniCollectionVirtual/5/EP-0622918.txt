<ABSTRACT>
An adaptive clock recovery arrangement for deriving a synchronous 
clock from an asynchronous, packet stream (11) such as an asynchronous transfer 

mode (ATM) cell stream. The deviation in the magnitude of information stored in a 
first-in-first-out memory (15) is continually monitored (25), and the synchronous 

clock frequency, referred to as the adaptive line clock frequency, is adjusted in a 
plurality of modes, under the control of a processor (29). The adjustment is made in 

response to a detected increasing condition of the monitored deviation. The 
adjustments are open-loop adjustments made without continually adjusting the 

adaptive line clock frequency based on the monitored deviation. Damping is 
substantially reduced compared with "conventional" PLL arrangements because the 

open-loop adjustments result in a rapid frequency correction with perfect or nearly 
perfect deadbeat damping, i.e. without the frequency oscillations that continue after 

the correct frequency is reached in closed-loop arrangements.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to communications systems. In recent years, many telephone, video and data communication systems 
have been developed where digital data streams are encoded into short packets or 
cells instead of using synchronous transmission. The evolving world-wide standard 
for this packet-based transmission and switching technology is called Asynchronous 
Transfer Mode (ATM). Although networks are evolving to ATM transmission, 
interfaces are needed to present-day synchronous switching and transmission 
systems and to end-point terminal equipment. Voice and video channels invariably 
require constant bit rate, synchronous interfaces. The process of converting from 
ATM, or other packet-based transmission, to a constant bit rate synchronous system 
basically requires two steps. The first step is extracting the cell payload data, which 
carries the synchronous bit stream, and storing it in a first-in-first-out (FIFO) 
memory. The FIFO acts as an elastic store to smooth out the bursty cell arrival. The 
second step is to recover or derive a clock, based on the average data arrival bit rate, 
and use the derived clock to clock data out of the FIFO and into a transmission 
interface circuit for transmission. Adaptive clocking is a name for the process of 
deriving an accurate clock rate from the data rate of the arriving cell/packet stream. The ATM cell stream is often bursty with short term variations in the 
cell arrival rate, which are on the order of one millisecond for some ATM systems. 
The derived (adapted) clock rate must stablize in seconds to a typical level of a few 
parts-per-million (ppm), and in the long term, must track the source rate exactly. 
Requirements vary widely between different systems and applications. Integrating 
the number of arriving ATM cells over a period of time is the fundamental technique 
in determining the mean clock rate. Long integration times can be used to produce a 
low jitter, narrow-band clock output. However, relatively long integration times 
cause a host of stability problems if a "conventional" phase-locked-loop (PLL), e.g., 
arrangement 210 (FIG. 10) described herein, is applied to this application. The 
integration time is directly related to feedback delay in the PLL control loop, which 
tends to make closed loop control systems unstable. Additionally, the adaptive clock 
slew rate must be limited, which causes more feedback delay. The damping factor 
will be large causing slow response and unstable operation. The use of phase-lead or 
multiple
