<ABSTRACT>
A closed tube (13) of plastics film is sealed using transverse sealing jaws (30) and is divided into two halves along its centre with a knife (40). In the centre of the transverse sealing seams, the tube (13) is cut through. By means of this process, a high capacity, a good utilisation of capacity and easy adaptation to other filling volumes are achieved.

A method of making bags (48), more particularly 
for food or drinks, from a tubular film (13) withdrawn 

from a supply reel (11), wherein the tubular film (13) 
is first transversely sealed and then separated into 

two halves along its longitudinal centre and the bags 
(48) are finally separated from the tube (13) by a cut 

in the region of the transverse sealing seams, and 
wherein the tubular film (13) is drawn off stepwise. 
Apparatus for performing the method according to 
claim 1, comprising: 


a holder (10) to receive a supply reel (11) of a 
tubular film (13), 
a storage unit (17) for storing a tubular film 
portion, 
a transverse sealing jaw (30) and co-acting jaw 
(31) for making a sealing seam (78) transversely 

of the length of the tubular film (13), 
a first cutting device (40) disposed downstream of 
the transverse sealing jaw (30) for separating the 

tubular film (13) along its longitudinal centre, 
a draw-off roller (26) disposed downstream of the 
first cutting device (40) and a pressure roller 

(25) pressed against the draw-off roller (26), 
wherein the draw-off roller (26) is connected to 

an intermittent drive (27, 28),  
 
a second cutting device (45, 46, 47) disposed 
downstream of the draw-off roller (26) for 

separating the bag (48) centrally through the 
sealing seams (78), and 
a means (50) for the simultaneous discharge of a 
pair of bags (48) in each case. 
Apparatus according to claim 2, wherein the 
intermittent drive (27, 28) is formed by a motor (29) 

and a pneumatic clutch (27). 
Apparatus according to claim 2 or 3, wherein the 

sealing jaw (30) is followed by a cooling jaw (32). 
Apparatus according to any one of claims 2 to 4, 
wherein the first cutting device (40) is formed by a 

stationary knife. 
Apparatus according to any one of claims 2 to 5, 
wherein the second cutting device (45, 46, 47) is 

formed by a knife (47) movable along a guide (46). 
Apparatus according to any one of claims 2 to 6, 
wherein another sealing device (80, 81) is provided for 

making an additional seal (79) in the region of folded-in 
longitudinal folds (77) at the two edges of the 

tubular film (13). 
Apparatus according to any one of claims 2 to 7, 
wherein the sealing jaw (30) and the co-acting jaw (31) 

are mounted on two carriages (61) jointly movable in 
the direction of advance (A) of the tubular film (13)  

 
and movable in synchronism with one another by means of 

two screw spindles (61). 
A film bag made on an apparatus according to claim 
7, wherein the bag (48) is rectangular in plan view and 

is folded at one of its narrow edges and has two finned 
sealing seams (78) along its two longitudinal edges, 

and wherein the bag (48) has a folded-in bottom fold 
(77) and, in the region of this bottom fold (77), an 

additional arcuate seal (79). 
A film bag according to claim 9, wherein the film 
consists of a plurality of layers, the innermost one of 

which has the lowest melting point, and wherein the 
outside of the film is not welded in the region of the 

bottom folds.
