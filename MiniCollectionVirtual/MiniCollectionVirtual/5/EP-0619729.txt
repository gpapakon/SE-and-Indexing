<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to compositions and methods
useful for subjects who wish to reduce tobacco smoking or
to find a socially acceptable substitute.Because of the reported harmful effects of tobacco
smoking and also due to the current social attitudes to
smoking, resulting in ever-increasing smoke-free public
areas, there is great pressure on tobacco smokers to stop
smoking or to find a more socially acceptable
alternative.For those who are unable to give up smoking
completely, various forms of nicotine-replacement therapy
have been suggested.Nicotine-containing chewing gum is available
commercially and has provided a satisfactory substitute
for tobacco-smoking for some people. For many people,
nicotine gum does not alleviate the craving for tobacco,
due to the gradually achieved and low blood nicotine
levels produced. Many people also experience unpleasant
side effects, such as nausea and indigestion (Jarvis et
al., British Medical Journal, Vol. 285, p. 537 (1982);
Schneider, Comprehensive Therapy, Vol. 13, p. 32 (1987)).Nicotine-containing nose drops have been reported
(Russell et al., British Medical Journal, Vol. 286, p.
683 (1983); Jarvis et al., Brit. J. of Addiction, Vol.
82, p. 983 (1987)). Nose drops, however, are difficult
to administer and are not convenient for use at work or
in other public situations. There may also be local
nasal irritation with use of nicotine nose drops. The
difficulty in administration also results in
unpredictability of the dose of nicotine administered.The use of skin patches for transdermal
administration of nicotine has been reported (Rose, in
Pharmacologic Treatment of Tobacco Dependence, (1986) pp. 
158-166, Harvard Univ. Press). Nicotine-containing skin
patches can cause local irritation and the absorption of
nicotine is slow and affected by cutaneous blood flow.U.S. Patents Nos. 4,920,989 and 4,953,572 disclose
the use of an inhaled nicotine aerosol, sometimes in
conjunction with nicotine skin patches, as a means of
reducing tobacco smoking. When skin patches were used,
transdermal absorption of nicotine gave blood nicotine
levels comparable to those achieved by tobacco smoking.
The use of the nicotine aerosol alone delivered
substantially less nicotine to the blood than is seen
while smoking tobacco but did provide sensations of
irritation in the airways of the user, thus mimicking
sensations associated with tobacco smoking.In order to ensure that the droplets of nicotine
solution would be carried into the respiratory airways on
inhalation through the mouth
