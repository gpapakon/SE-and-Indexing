<ABSTRACT>
Device for adjusting the position of a member (1) such as an alternator which is mounted articulated at a point (X-X) on the structure of an internal combustion engine, and some other point (6) of which is connected to the said structure by clamping means (7) capable of immobilising the said member (1) in position, characterised in that the said member includes recesses (8, 9) allowing the fitting of thrusting means capable of interacting with the said clamping means (6, 7) to allow the said member (1) to be moved about its axis of rotation (X-X) until it comes into a predetermined position.

A device for setting the position of a member (1), such as an
alternator, one point (X-X) of which is articulated on the structure of an internal

combustion engine and another point (6) of which is connected to this structure by

clamp means (7) adapted to lock this member (1) in position, characterised in that
this member comprises recesses (8, 9) enabling the positioning of thrust means

adapted to cooperate with the clamp means (6, 7) in order to enable the member (1)
to be displaced about its axis of rotation (X-X) until it occupies a predetermined

position.
A device for setting the position of a member as claimed in claim 1,
characterised in that the clamp means comprise a threaded rod (7) rigid with the

structure cooperating with a port (6) forming a slideway borne by this member (1),
the axis (Y-Y) of the threaded rod (7) being substantially parallel to the axis of

rotation of the member (1).
A device for setting the position of a member as claimed in claim 2,
characterised in that the thrust means are formed by a screw and a nut.
A device for setting the position of a member as claimed in claim 3,
characterised in that the recesses comprise a rectilinear groove (9) adapted to house

the screw, this groove (9) extending perpendicular to the threaded rod (7) and
substantially in the axis of the port (6) such that the screw can come to bear on the

threaded rod (7), the groove (9) having a polygonal recess (8) adapted partially to
house the screw.
