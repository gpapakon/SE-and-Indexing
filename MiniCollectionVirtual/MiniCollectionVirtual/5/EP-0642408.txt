<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus for the
manufacture of an elongated tubular film product from a
length of flexible flat film, preferably by means of a
forming collar which folds and shapes the flat flexible
film about a cylinder or mandrel.US-A-5,085,036 discloses an apparatus for the high
speed manufacture of elongated tubular film products
from a length of flexible flat film. In that patent,
film from a roll is unspooled, passed over a forming
collar and thence onto a forming tube. The film on the
tube has longitudinal edges that are overlapped and
sealed or attached to one another. The film is advanced
on the tube by a pair of opposed drive units which are
positioned on opposite sides of the forming tube. The
advance or drive units transport the film over the tube
continuously. The film advance units comprise boggie
mounted drive belts positioned on opposite sides of the
forming tube. The closed loop belts are designed to
frictionally engage the formed film and transfer the
film along the tube. In operation these drive units are
precisely adjusted to maintain an appropriate spacing
between the forming tube and the boggie mounted drive
belts. It is important to make sure that the drive
belts on each side of the elongate forming tube are
uniformly and equally spaced from the forming tube so
that the film can be uniformly driven or moved on the
tube.Adjustment of the spacing of the drive units such
as the boggie mounted drive belt has required a mounting
mechanism which independently positions each boggie
mounted drive belts as a desired distance from the
centre line of the tube. There has remained a need, 
however, to provide an improved mechanism to
simultaneously position the drive or transport
assemblies or units on the opposite sides of the
cylindrical forming tube.One mechanism is known from JP-A-61/090911 in which
belts running either side of a fruit conveyor may be
moved toward and away from each other simultaneously.It is also known from EP-A-0,343,601 to provide a
mechanism for mounting and adjusting two parallel spaced
transport assemblies or drive units associated with a
device for forming a sheet of flexible material into a
cylindrical shape, said device including a generally
cylindrical tube as a form for the sheet, said mechanism
comprising, in combination:
at least one assembly support bar mounted generally
transversely to the centre line of the tube;a spacing adjustment plate pivotally mounted
adjacent the assemblies for pivotal movement about an
axis; anda first arm pivotally
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A mechanism for mounting and adjusting two parallel
spaced transport assemblies (22,24) or drive units

associated with a device for forming a sheet (14) of
flexible material into a cylindrical shape, said device

including a generally cylindrical tube (18) as a form
for the sheet, said mechanism comprising, in

combination:

at least one assembly support bar (26,28) mounted
generally transversely to the centre line (20) of the

tube (18);
a spacing adjustment plate (40) pivotally mounted
adjacent the assemblies for pivotal movement about an

axis (42); and
a first arm (34) pivotally connected to one
assembly (22) and a second arm (44) pivotally connected

to the other assembly (24), characterised in that said
at least one assembly support bar (26, 28) extends over

the range of desired travel of the assemblies, means
(30,32) are provided for slidably mounting each assembly

on the support bar for slidable movement toward and away
from the centre line (20), said first arm (34) extends

generally parallel to the support bar to pivotally
attach to the spacing adjustment plate a
t a first
position which is a first fixed radial distance from the

axis thereof, said second arm (44) extends generally
parallel to the support bar to pivotally attach to the

spacing adjustment plate at a second position which is a
second fixed radial distance from the axis thereof, and

in that said first and second positions of attachment to
the plate are on opposite sides of a line through the

plate axis and parallel to the support bar, whereby
pivotal movement of the plate about its axis will

simultaneously move the first and second arms in
opposite directions and simultaneously impart opposite

movement of the assemblies toward or away from the
centre line.
A mechanism as claimed in claim 1, wherein a first
and a second parallel support bar (26,28) are mounted to

slidably support the assemblies (22,24).
A mechanism as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the
spacing adjustment plate (40) is pivotally mounted at

one side of an assembly (22,24).
A mechanism as claimed in claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein
the first fixed radial distance is equal to the second

fixed radial distance whereby the assemblies (22,24)
move in an opposite sense and equal distance upon

pivotal movement of the spacing adjustment plate (40)
about the axis (42).
A mechanism as claimed in any of the preceding
claims including means (52,57) on the spacing adjustment

plate (40) for locking the plate in a fixed pivotal
position.
