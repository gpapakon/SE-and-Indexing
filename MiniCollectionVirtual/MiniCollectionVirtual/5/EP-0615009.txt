<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for feeding an approximately uniform fibre mass over one complete unrolling interval (T) of a lap (9) unrollable from a lap roll (W) to a gripper assembly (12) movable to and fro. It is known from practice that, with a decreasing roll weight, the dynamic differences which occur lead to a drift of the linear density of the fibre sliver formed on the combing machine. To overcome this disadvantage, it is now proposed that a clamping force (K) extending over the width of the lap be exerted on the unrolled lap (9) at least during the largest part of the unrolling interval between the winding rollers (5, 6) and the gripper assembly (12).

<CLAIMS>
A method for supplying a lap (9) which can be 
unwound from a wound lap (W) to a reciprocatable 

nipper unit (12) of a combing machine, with the 
wound lap resting on rotatably held lap rollers 

(5, 6) and with at least one of the lap rollers 
being in contact with a drive (7), characterized 

in that at least during the major part of the unwinding 
interval a nip force (K) extending over 

the width of the lap is exerted between the lap 
rollers (5, 6) and the nipper unit (12) on the unwound 

lap (8), which force is chosen so high that 
the dynamic differences which are taken up by the 

unwound lap and which occur by the reduction of 
the diameter of the wound lap during the unwinding 

interval do not act upon the zone (22) of the lap 
(9) where the lap is supplied directly to the nipper 

unit. 
An apparatus for carrying out the method as 
claimed in claim 1 for supplying a lap (9) which 

can be unwound from a wound lap (W) to a reciprocatable 
nipper unit (12) of a combing machine, 

with the wound lap resting on rotatably held lap 
rollers (5, 6) and with at least one of the lap 

rollers being in contact with a drive (7) and with 
a pair of pressure rollers (10, 11) being arranged 

between the lap rollers (5, 6) and the nipper unit 
(12) transversally to the conveying direction (F) 

of the lap (9) and with at least one of the pressure 
rollers (11) being movably held in the direction 

towards the other one and being loaded so as 
to produce a predetermined nip force, characterized 

in that a spring element (25) is provided for 
loading the pressure rollers (11), which ensures 

that the nip force can be exerted on the unwound  
 

lap at least during the major part of the unwinding 
interval between the lap rollers and the nipper 

unit, with the nip force being chosen so high 
that the dynamic differences which are taken up by 

the unwound lap and which occur by the reduction 
of the diameter of the wound lap during the unwinding 

interval do not act upon the zone (22) of 
the lap (9) where the lap is supplied directly to 

the nipper unit. 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 2, characterized 
in that at least one roller (11) of the pair of 

pressure rollers (10, 11) is connected to a drive 
(7). 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 3, characterized 
in that the pressure roller (11) not connected to 

the drive (7) is held movably and spring-loaded in 
the direction of the central axis of the driven 

roller (10). 
An apparatus for carrying out the method as 
claimed in claim 1 for supplying a lap (9) which 

can be unwound from a wound lap (W) to a reciprocatable 
nipper unit (12) of a combing machine, 

with the wound lap resting on rotatably held lap 
rollers (5, 6) and with at least one of the lap 

rollers being in contact with a drive (7) and with 
a nipper element (30) being arranged between the 

lap rollers (5, 6) and the nipper unit (12) transversally 
to the conveying direction (F) of the lap 

(9), which element cooperates with a further element 
(35, 28, 45) to produce a predetermined nip 

force, with the further element (35, 38, 45) being 
held movably in the direction towards the nipper 

element (30) and is loaded to produce a predetermined 
nip force, characterized in that the nipper  

 
element is arranged as a revolving apron (30) and 

a spring element (41, 46) is provided for loading 
the further element (35, 38, 45), that the nip 

force can be exerted on the unwound lap at least 
during the major part of the unwinding interval 

between the lap rollers and the nipper unit, with 
the nip force being chosen so high that the dynamic 

differences which are taken up by the unwound 
lap and which occur by the reduction of the 

diameter of the wound lap during the unwinding interval 
do not act upon the zone (22) of the lap 

(9) where the lap is supplied directly to the nipper 
unit. 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 5, characterized 
in that the further element consists of a further 

revolving apron (38) opposite of the apron (30) 
and at least one apron (30) rests spring-loaded on 

the other apron (38). 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 5, characterized 
in that the further element consists of a pressure 

roller (45) cooperating with the apron (30). 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 7, characterized 
in that the pressure roller (45) is loaded via a 

spring element (46) in the direction of the apron 
(30).
