<ABSTRACT>
A process is provided for reclaiming rejected 
polycarbonate articles, such as an automotive headlamplens 

having a thermoplastic acrylic primer and a defective 
silicone hardcoat. The silicone hardcoat can be selectively 

removed with an aqueous alkaline bath treatment. The 
treated polycarbonate article can be recovered with the 

thermoplastic acrylic primer remaining substantially 
intact; the article can be restored by treatment with a 

silicone hardcoat.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for 
restoring silicone-polycarbonate parts which have been 
rejected during the manufacture of such articles. More 
particularly, the present invention relates to the use of an 
aqueous alkaline bath to treat a silicone-polycarbonate part 
comprising a silicone hardcoat layer, an intermediate 
thermoplastic acrylic primer layer and a polycarbonate 
substrate to effect the selective removal of a defective 
silicone hardcoat layer. During the manufacture of polycarbonate parts 
having a silicone hardcoat and an intermediate 
thermoplastic acrylic primer layer, several parts are often 
rejected due to a defective silicone hardcoat. A typical 
coating procedure used to make silicone hardcoat 
polycarbonate articles is shown by Goossens et al., U.S. 
patent 4,242,381, Olson et al., U.S. patent 4,284,685 and 
Patel, U.S. patent 5,041,313 which are incorporated herein 
by reference. A procedure for salvaging organic thermoplastic 
values from discarded thermoplastic articles having a 
decorative or protective coating is shown in copending 
application of Gillette et al., serial no. 07/981,668, filed 
September 25, 1992. Among the articles which can be 
treated are silicone-polycarbonate composites which can be 
in granulated form. During the treatment of the composites, 
the silicone hardcoat is removed; if these composites have 
an acrylic primer, it also is removed. The resulting 
thermoplastic polycarbonate can then be reextruded and  
 
remolded. The remolded polycarbonate then has to be 
reprimed and hardcoated. It would be desirable therefore to provide a 
satisfactory procedure for salvaging defective silicone-polycarbonate 
composites, such as intact headlamp-lenses 
having both a thermoplastic acrylic primer and a silicone 
hardcoat. It also would be desirable to avoid the 
requirement of having to remold such rejected parts, or the 
need to reprime such polycarbonate substrates after the 
silicone hardcoat has been removed. The present invention is based on the discovery 
that if a silicone-polycarbonate part comprising a silicone 
hardcoat layer, an intermediate thermoplastic acrylic 
primer layer and a polycarbonate substrate is immersed and 
agitated in an aqueous alkaline solution, as defined 
hereinafter, for a particular duration, the silicone hardcoat 
can be selectively removed without substantially affecting 
the thermoplastic acrylic primer layer. Accordingly, 
substantial restoration of the original silicone-polycarbonate 
part can be achieved by

<CLAIMS>
A process for selectively removing a 
defective silicone hardcoat layer from a silicone-polycarbonate 

composite comprising a silicone hardcoat 
layer, an intermediate thermoplastic acrylic primer layer 

and a polycarbonate substrate which process comprises: 

(1) effecting contact at a temperature of 
about 40°C to about 100°C between a silicone-polycarbonate 

composite and an aqueous alkaline bath having a pH in the 
range of at least 12 and up to about 14 while the bath is 

agitated for a time sufficient to effect the selective 
removal of the silicone hard coat layer from the silicone-polycarbonate 

composite, 
(2) washing and thereafter drying the 
resulting polycarbonate composite of (1) and 
(3) treating the polycarbonate composite 
of (2) with a silicone hardcoat mixture to form a silicone-polycarbonate 

composite. 
The process in accordance with Claim 1, 
where the silicone-polycarbonate composite is a silicone-bisphenol 

A polycarbonate composite. 
The process in accordance with Claim 1, 
where the thermoplastic acrylic primer layer is a 

polymethylmethacrylate. 
The process in accordance with Claim 1, 
where the thermoplastic acrylic primer layer is a 

polyethylmethacrylate. 
A process in accordance with Claim 1, 
where the silicone-polycarbonate composite is contacted to 

the aqueous stripping bath for about 10 to about 120 
minutes. 
A process in accordance with Claim 1, 
where the silicone hardcoat mixture in step (3) has a pH in 

the range of about 3.5 to about 8.
