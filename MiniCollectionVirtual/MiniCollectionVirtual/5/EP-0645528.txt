<ABSTRACT>
A flexible joint (1) for an automobile exhaust system includes a 
flexible 

bellows (8) for sealing the communication between the engine and the 
tail pipe (2) with 

first (3) and second flanges (5) fixed to the respective members and 
interconnected by 

coupling shafts (12) that are fixed at one end to one of the flanges (5) 
and 

passed loosely 
through the other flange (3) whereby compression springs (15,16) 

that surround 
the coupling 

shafts (12) serve together with the bellows (8) to provide 
support capable of 

accommodating relative axial and angular deflections between the 
members. One 

of the flanges is so configured and disposed with respect to the 
bellows (8) as to limit 

the amount of angular deflection imposed on the bellows (8). Damping 
sleeves (17,18) 

composed of compressed wire mesh material operate to dampen vibrations 
imposed on the joint (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a flexible joint for connecting elements for 
conducting exhaust gases from an automobile engine to the outside such that an 
angle of connection between the elements is changeable and the exhaust pipes are 
capable of freely moving relatively toward or away from each other. As a joint of this type, one disclosed in, for instance, Japanese Utility 
Model Unexamined Publication No. 86986/1983 is known. The joint disclosed in 
this publication comprises a bellows tube for preventing the leakage of exhaust 
gases and connecting together respective exhaust pipes of an engine-side exhaust 
system and a tail pipe-side exhaust system in such a manner that an angle of 
connection is changeable and the exhaust pipes are capable of freely moving 
relatively toward or away from each other, as well as a coil spring for resiliently 
connecting the exhaust pipes by resiliently restricting the expansion of the bellows 
tube more than is necessary. The joint of this type is required to absorb the vibrations of the exhaust 
pipe of the engine-side exhaust system and prevent transmission of the vibrations  
 
to the exhaust pipe of the tail pipe-side exhaust system. With the joint disclosed 
in the aforementioned publication, however, since the two exhaust pipes are 
connected resiliently via the coil spring, vibrations based on the phenomenon of 
mechanical resonance are liable to occur. As a result of this phenomenon of 
mechanical resonance, there is a possibility that the vibrations are transmitted to 
the exhaust pipe of the tail pipe-side exhaust system without being dampened, 
thereby producing unpleasant noise in and outside the automobile and deteriorating 
the riding comfort of occupants in the automobile. In addition, with the above-described joint, when the vibration, particularly 
swinging vibration, of the exhaust pipe of the engine-side exhaust system occurs, 
the bellows tube is swung with its fixed portion to the exhaust pipe of the tail 
pipe-side exhaust system as a fulcrum. As a result, large repeated bending occurs 
to one fixed portion of the bellows tube as compared with the other fixed portion. 
Mechanical fatigue due to this repeated bending sometimes causes damage to one 
fixed portion of the bellows tube at an early period. Meanwhile, although the temperature of the exhaust gases from the engine 
is about 1100°C, if the exhaust gases of this temperature are brought into direct 
contact with the bellows tube, the corrosion and deterioration of the bellows tube
