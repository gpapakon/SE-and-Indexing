<DESCRIPTION>
There is considerable commercial interest in simple, disposable, self-contained 
devices for performing biochemical diagnostic assays in extra-laboratory situations. Ideally 
such devices should avoid any need for complex manual procedures, such as a timed 
sequence of reagent additions to an analyte, and so be suitable for use by lay persons. According to Patent Specification WO90/11519 such devices can be of a kind 
comprising first and second liquid flow channels of porous materials leading from a 
respective pair of channel ends to a common site, which channels are operable to transfer 
liquid by capillary flow to the common site in sequentially timed manner following 
simultaneous application of the liquid to the pair of channel ends. However, while Specification WO90/11519 describes a variety of particular devices 
of this kind, they are largely suited to carrying out a single analytical procedure. In contrast 
there are many situations in which it is desirable to perform plural procedures 
simultaneously and there would be advantage in a multiple device of integrated form 
making available such a performance. The present invention provides an improved device of the above-mentioned kind 
which is particularly, but not exclusively, of the subsequently mentioned multiple 
integrated form. According to the present invention, the improved device comprises first and second 
liquid flow channels of porous material leading from a respective pair of channel ends to 
a common site, which channels are operable to transfer liquid by capillary flow to the 
common site in sequentially timed manner following simultaneous application of the liquid 
to the pair of channel ends, wherein said first and second channels are formed by respective 
layers of porous material mutually superposed in a sheet sandwich arrangement, separated 
by a liquid impermeable barrier except for at least one selected area over which the layers 
are held in fixed engagement with each other for liquid flow therebetween. In multiple integrated form the improved device has a plurality of first and second 
channel pairs formed by common respective porous material layers. The plurality of 
channels of each layer of porous material may be formed by application of an agent to 
render the material therebetween impervious. The invention is further described below, by way of example, with reference to the 
accompanying drawings, in which:-  
 Figures 1 to 5 respectively illustrate different forms of 
device which accord with the invention and/or

<CLAIMS>
A device (10) for performing biochemical diagnostic assays comprising first and 
second liquid flow channels (11,12) of porous material leading from a respective pair of 

channel ends to a common site (S), which channels are operable to transfer liquid by 
capillary flow to the common site in sequentially timed manner following simultaneous 

application of the liquid to the pair of channel ends, wherein said first and second channels 
are formed by respective layers of porous material mutually superposed in a sheet sandwich 

arrangement, separated by a liquid impermeable barrier (13a, 13b) except for at least one 
selected area over which the layers are held in fixed engagement with each other for liquid 

flow therebetween. 
A device according to Claim 1, comprising a plurality of said first and second 
channel pairs formed by common respective layers of porous material. 
A device according to claim 2, wherein the plurality of channels of each layer of 
porous material are formed by the excision of porous material therebetween. 
A device according to claim 2, wherein the plurality of channels of each layer of 
porous material are formed by application of an agent to render the material therebetween 

impervious. 
A device according to any preceding claim, wherein the layers of porous material 
are engaged at said selected area by adhesion. 
A device according to any preceding claim, wherein the layers of porous material 
are urged into engagement at said selected area by at least one compression element. 
A device according to claim 6, wherein the said channels are at least partially 
contained within a housing, and each said compression element is supported by the 

housing. 
A device according to any preceding claim, whereby said liquid impermeable 
barrier comprises a sheet of plastics material.
