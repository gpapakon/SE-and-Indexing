<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fungistatic composition 
comprising a Type II endoglycosidase and a peroxidase as 
well as to a fungistatic method utilizing such a composition. Fruit, vegetable and plants are all susceptible to attack by fungi, 
resulting in loss of crops, decreased shelf-life of produce and ultimately 
higher costs for consumers. Many fungi are known pathogens in several 
diseases which harm or destroy crops worldwide. Examples of such fungi 
include, but are not limited to, Peniculliumitalicum, Penicilliumexpansum, 
Penicilliumdigitatum, Diplodianatalenses, Botrytiscinerea, 
Moniliniafructicola, Rhizophusstulonifer, and Rhizopusnigricans. 
These fungi 
attack such produce as citrus, apples, cherries, strawberries, nectarines, 
peaches, etc. A particularly troublesome fungus has been Botrytiscinerea which causes 
gray-mold rot in crops such as citrus, apples, grapes, pears, strawberries 
and cherries. Gray-mold or fruit rot is a widespread disease resulting in 
severe crop losses. The rot can occur in the field, but latent infections 
may not become apparent until the crop has been harvested, thus resulting in 
decreased storage, shipping and shelf-life of the resulting produce. There 
is a need to develop an antifungal agent(s) useful against many fungi and 
particularly Botrytis, such agent to be used as a pre or post-harvest 
treatment of crops susceptible to such infection.  
 EP-A-0 184 288 describes the use of enzymes capable of 
degrading a protecting or supporting component of a target 
organism in herbicidal, insecticidal or fungicidal 
compositions. WO 91/06312 discloses a method for protecting a harvested 
crop from pathogens comprising applying to the harvested 
crop and to any pathogen present thereon a compound capable 
of generating an active oligomer elicitor in the crop or the 
pathogen. The compound is applied with a penetrating agent 
which aids in the entry of the compound into the cuticle layer 
of the harvested grop or the pathogen. WO 91/06313 discloses a method for protecting a growing crop 
from pathogens comprising applying to the growing crop and 
to an pathogen present thereon a compound capable of generating 
an active oligomer elicitor in the crop or the pathogen. EP-A-0 425 019 describes antimirobial compositions comprising 
endo-Î²-N-acetylglucoseaminidase and/or endoglycopeptidase, 
and ruminant stomach lysozyme. JP 54073182 (Derwent Abstract 79-53712B/29) discloses a method 
for preparing a bacteriolytic enzyme having broad bacteriolytic 
spectrum,
