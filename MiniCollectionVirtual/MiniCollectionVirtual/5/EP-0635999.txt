<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to apparatus 
and methods for forming first and second, continuous, 
independent, extrudates, and particularly to apparatus 
and methods for simultaneously forming two dough sheets 
from a single cooker extruder for the preparation of a 
snack product by conventional deep fat frying. One type of snack product which has gained wide 
market acceptance is the "puffed" snack product. In 
certain methods of preparation, a cooked farinaceous 
dough is formed into a single continuous dough sheet. 
This dough sheet is then run through a piece forming 
apparatus which includes an opposed pair of rollers at 
least one of which has depressions which stamp out the 
desired shape and size pieces from the dough sheet. 
After formation of the dough pieces, the pieces are dried 
under controlled conditions from a moisture content of 
about 18% down to a moisture content of between 10% and 
15% to form a half product or pellet. The moisture 
content of the half product is sufficiently low to 
exhibit extended shelf stability. The snack product is  
 
prepared from the half product by conventional deep fat 
frying. The frying of the half product generates steam 
volumes inside of the half product to puff the half 
product resulting in a light, puffed snack product having 
surface corrugations. The sale of snack food products is a highly 
competitive business. The novelty of snack food products 
decline rapidly, as new and different types of snack 
foods are introduced to maintain or increase market share. 
Puffed snack products can be varied in various ways such 
as by changing the shapes, sizes, and surface corrugations 
of the pieces or by changing the composition of the dough 
from which the half products are prepared. Another 
variation is to have the puffed snack product of a hollow 
structure, with the hollow configuration resulting from 
the fabrication of the half products from a two-layer 
laminated dough sheet. One method of forming a laminated 
dough sheet is to fold a single continuous dough sheet 
into a two-plied dough sheet as set forth in U.S. 
application No. 699,039 filed May 13, 1991, now U.S. 
Patent No. 5,092,757. The continuous dough sheet is often formed by passing 
a plurality (such as 4) of spaced ropes of dough between 
sheet pressing rollers. The spaced ropes of dough are 
extruded from a cooker extruder onto a conveyor which 
delivers the ropes of dough to the sheet pressing rollers. 
Generally, the dough ropes are formed by forcing the dough 
through a
