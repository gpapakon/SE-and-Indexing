<ABSTRACT>
An absorbent article having a liquid permeable topsheet (11), 
a liquid impermeable backsheet (12), an absorbent member (13) 

interposed between said topsheet and backsheet, and a 
moisture absorbent material, wherein the amount of moisture 

absorption per unit area of the absorbent article is 
not less than 7.2 x 10⁻⁴ g/hr·cm², and a total amount of 

moisture absorption of the absorbent article is not less 
than 0.10 g/hr in an environment of 35°C/75%RH.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an absorbent article, such 
as a disposable diaper, an incontinence pad or a sanitary 
napkin, which is excellent in hygroscopicity (moisture 
absorbent property) and free from an uncomfortable feeling 
during use, such as stuffiness or stickiness, and to a 
method for controlling the humidity and the rise of the 
humidity in the area of the absorbent article during wear. 
Description of the Prior Art In a well-known manner, an absorbent article comprises 
a liquid permeable surface material, a liquid 
impermeable antileakage material and an absorbent member 
interposed therebetween for absorbing and retaining the 
liquid. The functions required of the absorbent article 
are to absorb excreted body fluid quickly and to prevent 
the return of the absorbed body fluid. Up to now, a 
variety of proposals, centered about these functions, has 
been made. Recently, there has also been a demand for various 
functions concerning the feeling of the absorbent article 
during use. For example, it is strongly desired that the 
color of the body fluid diffused into the absorbent member 
be concealed and that the surface of the absorbent article  
 
in direct contact with the user's skin be similar to a 
cloth in both appearance and touch, and soft in feeling. 
As for feeling, interalia, it has become a crucial task 
to reduce the stuffiness and stickiness of the absorbent 
article worn by the user. The absorbent article is used in such a manner that 
it is in contact with a particular portion of the user's 
body for a prolonged period of time. In accordance with 
the improved absorbent performance of the absorbent article 
in recent years, the article tends to be used for prolonged 
period of time, so that the need to reduce stuffiness 
and stickiness is more strongly felt, than the need 
for improved feeling. That is, if the article is not 
improved with respect to stuffiness and stickiness, the 
skin in contact with the absorbent article is subjected to 
thermal stress for a prolonged period of time, and undergoes 
bloating under high humidity, such that, in the 
worst case, skin troubles, such as itching or a rash are 
produced to the extent that the user cannot continue to 
wear the absorbent article. There has also been proposed a variety of techniques 
of improving a topsheet as a method for combatting the 
stuffy or sticky feel. For example, there has been proposed 
a technique of employing a non-woven fabric of an 
agglomerated mass of hydrophobic fine fibers, as a surface

Use of a sanitary napkin (10) according to any one of claims 1 to 3, for controlling 
the humidity in the area around said sanitary napkin (10) during wear. 
Use of a sanitary napkin (10) according to claim 4, wherein the rise in relative 
humidity in an environment between the skin of a user and said sanitary napkin 

(10) is controlled not to be higher than 70% relative humidity by absorbing any 
moisture transpired from the user by the moisture absorbent material in said 

sanitary napkin (10) and by discharging said absorbed moisture to the outside 
vicinity via a liquid impermeable backsheet (12) having moisture permeability.
