<ABSTRACT>
A kit of curable orthopedic casting/splinting 
materials (11) in a substantially hermetic heat sealed 

package (10). The package (10) is formed of laminate 
sheet material (20; 30) having a heat sealable inner layer 

(24; 34) and an outer layer (21, 22; 31, 32). A plurality 
of evenly-spaced fibers (25; 35) are provided between the 

inner layer (24; 34) and outer layer (21, 22; 31, 32) of 
the laminate sheet material (20; 30) to facilitate tearing 

the laminate sheet material (20; 30) in a predetermined 

direction. The evenly-spaced fibers (25; 35) define the 
predetermined direction for the desired tear path, and are 

arranged and sized so as to facilitate evenly winding the 
laminate sheet material into rolls before cutting and heat 

sealing to form packages (10) and to allow forming 
reliable heat seals containing the fibers (25; 35).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of
orthopedic splinting/casting materials and packaging for
the same. More particularly, the present invention
relates to curable orthopedic splinting/casting material
in a heat sealed hermetic package which includes means for
facilitating tearing of the package in a predetermined
direction.Hermetic packaging constructed from heat
sealable laminated materials is well-known. Many products
are placed in such packages to extend their shelf life by
sealing the products from exposure to air, water vapor,
etc. Heat sealed hermetic packaging constructed from
laminated sheet materials is especially popular because of
its relatively low cost as compared to effectiveness.The hermeticity of such packages is especially
important in the field of packaging for curable orthopedic
splinting/casting materials. Such products are discussed
in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,433,680; 4,609,578; 4,667,661;
4,774,937; and 5,027,803.Briefly, however, such products are extremely
sensitive to ambient levels of water vapor and will harden
(i.e., "cure") upon exposure to very low levels of water
vapor. Once hardened, the product can no longer be used
for its intended purpose and must be discarded. Because
of their sensitivity, such products are typically packaged
in single-use hermetic packages as constructed from
composite laminate sheet materials.Hermetically sealed packages constructed from
laminated sheet materials are, however, typically
difficult to open due to the nature of the materials used
to manufacture them. The laminated sheet materials
typically comprise three or more layers chosen for their 
strength, moisture impermeability, and/or heat
sealability. The composite material is difficult to tear
and is particularly difficulty to tear in a desired
direction. As a result, users must typically first tear
the package once and additionally tear, cut or, for
example, open one of the heat sealed ends to provide a
large enough opening to allow adequate access to the
product inside.One attempt to provide heat sealed hermetic
packages which provide predictable tearing characteristics
is discussed in U.S. Patent No. 4,598,826. Tear strips
are laminated to the interior of the package to facilitate
tearing of the package in a desired direction lying along
the tear strips. Such packages are, however, difficult to
manufacture as the tear strips must typically be
introduced as the package is formed from the laminated
sheet material. In addition, the hermeticity of the
packages can be compromised if the

<CLAIMS>
A kit of orthopedic casting/splinting materials comprising:

a) a sheet (11) of curable casting/splinting material; and
b) a substantially hermetic package (10) containing the
sheet (11) of curable casting/splinting material, the package

(10) comprising:

1) laminate sheet material (20; 30) having opposite
side edges, and an outer layer (21, 22; 31, 32) and a heat

sealable inner layer (24; 34) bonded to the outer layer (21,
22; 31, 32); and
2) a heat seal (12, 14 and 16) bonding at least a
portion of the inner layer (24; 34) of the laminate

sheet material (20; 30) to form the package (10), the
heat seal (12, 14 and 16) bonding the laminate sheet

material (20; 30) to form opposite ends of the package
(10), the ends of the package (10) defining a first

direction extending between the ends and a second
direction extending generally perpendicularly with

respect to the first direction;

the kit being 
characterized in that
 a plurality of
generally parallel fibers (25; 35) are substantially

evenly spaced apart and disposed within the inner layer
(34) or between the inner layer (24) and the outer

layer (21, 22; 31, 32), the fibers extending substantially
along the first direction to guide tearing

the package (10) along the first direction, the fibers
(25; 35) being substantially evenly spaced apart along

the laminate sheet material (20; 30) across
substantially the entire laminate sheet material (20;

30) in the second direction such that the distance
between either side of the laminate sheet material (20;
