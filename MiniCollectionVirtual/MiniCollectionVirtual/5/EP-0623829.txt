<ABSTRACT>
A method and a device are proposed for controlling the pulsed transmitted signal, especially the transmission current, of an analog push-button. In this case, the transmitted signal pulses are converted into push-button pulses, especially into light pulses, which are transmitted by at least one transmitter (13), and the push-button pulses reflected by an object (17) are received by at least one receiver (21) and are converted into at least one received signal, especially into a received current. The actual value of the amplitude of the received signal is compared with an adjustable nominal value (33) and, if the actual value exceeds the nominal value by at least one specific first threshold value, the amplitude (41) of the transmitted signal is reduced, and the frequency (37) of the transmitted signal is increased, or, if the actual value is less than the nominal value by at least one specific second threshold value, the amplitude of the transmitted signal is increased, and the frequency of the transmitted signal is reduced, such that the amplitude of the received signal is equal to the nominal value and the transmitted power remains constant.
