<ABSTRACT>
A transmission apparatus for a round-trip 
satellite which can establish stabilized frame 

synchronization even if the distance between the round-trip 
satellite and a communications terminal varies and 

which can minimize the displacement between a frame 
signal received on the ground and another frame signal 

generated in a communications terminal. The 
transmission apparatus comprises M (M is an integral 

number equal to or greater than 2) composers (3) for 
forming frame signals, M transmitters (8) for outputting 

M spot beams having different radiation directions, and 
M delay circuits (6) interposed between the composers 

(3) and the transmitters (8). The delay times of the 
delay circuits (6) are set so that they are long where 

the radiation angles of the corresponding spot beams are 
small, but they are shorter where the radiation angles 

are larger.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a transmission
apparatus of the frame signal communication type carried
on a round-trip satellite in a satellite communications
system which employs a plurality of round-trip
satellites.A multiple connection communications system
wherein communications are performed by way of
communications satellites normally employs geostationary
satellites on a geostationary orbit. However, also
another system wherein round-trip satellites are used
for communications has been proposed since the period of
the dawn of satellite communications in the decade of
1950.In recent years, as increase of the size of a
rocket for launching a satellite proceeds, the technique
of launching a large satellite with a small satellite
carried thereon has been established and a rocket for
launching a small satellite has been developed, which 
allows economical launching of a small satellite.
Incidentally, particular attention is paid to a
satellite communications system based on round-trip
satellites wherein a plurality of small satellites make
a round-trip along a low earth orbit or a medium earth
orbit. The satellite communications system is
advantageous, when compared with another system which
employs geostationary satellites, in that it involves a
less transmission delay and a transmission/reception
terminal can be reduced in size. The "IRIDIUM system"
proposed by Motorola, Inc., United States is known as
one of such satellite communications systems based on
round-trip satellites.FIG. 7 shows a general construction of a
satellite communications system based on low earth orbit
satellites. Referring to FIG. 7, the satellite
communications system shown includes a plurality of
round-trip satellites 101 to 103 and so forth, and a
plurality of network control stations 104 to 107 and so
forth disposed in communication areas of the round-trip
satellites 101 to 103 such that at least one network
control station is present in each of the communication
areas. Each of the network control stations 104 to 107
connects a communication channel of a satellite to a 
subscriber network 109, performs accounting management
and performs management of network subscribers thereof.
Among the network control stations 104 to 107,
particularly the network 107 serves as a reference
station for controlling the entire network. A small
size communications terminal 108 may be carried freely
by a subscriber of the network or carried by an
automobile.Each of the round-trip satellites 101 to 103
irradiates a plurality of spot beams in

integral number equal to or greater than 2, a frame
generator for generating a frame synchronizing signal at

a fixed interval, M composers for forming frame signals

times are shorter where the radiation angles are larger.
A transmission apparatus for a round-trip
satellite as set forth in claim 1, characterized in that

said delay time setting means (12) sets the delay time
of each of said delay circuits (6) in accordance with 

the distance between said round-trip satellite and a
center line of a cell produced from the corresponding

spot beam on the ground so that the delay time for the delay circuit (6), which
increases in inverse proportion to the distance, is selected from amongst fixed values.
A transmission apparatus for a round-trip

and conversion means (15) for converting measurement

data from said distance measurement means (13) into a

distance, the delay time being adjusted in accordance
with a variation of the distance.
