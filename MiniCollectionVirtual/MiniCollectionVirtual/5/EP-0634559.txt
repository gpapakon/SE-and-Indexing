<ABSTRACT>
Fluid driven down-the-hole drilling machine. The hammer piston (2) of the 
down-the-hole drilling machine is adjacent to its front end provided with a cylindrical 

part (6). The drill bit (3) is provided with a first impact surface (41) which receives 
impacts during drilling, a second impact surface (42) and an annular section (7) which 

surrounds the cylindrical part (6) between the impact surfaces. The second impact 
surface (42) receives the impact energy of the hammer piston at reversed feeding of 

the housing (1) of the down-the-hole drilling machine for freeing the drill bit when it 
has become stuck.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fluid driven down-the-hole drilling machine, i.e. a
drilling machine driven by liquid or gas. More specifically the invention relates to a
down-the-hole drilling machine provided with a backhammer for freeing a drill bit
which has become stuck.In a prior art backhammer for down-the-hole drilling machines, see DE 3802391, a
separate backhammer unit is used which when needed is connected to the drill string
in order to free the drill bit by means of impacts in a direction away from the drill bit.
This device is very time-consuming to use.The present invention, which is defined in the subsequent claims, aims at achieving a
fluid driven down-the-hole drilling machine where the drill bit is easily freed when
stuck through reverse feed of the down-the-hole drilling machine.An embodiment of the invention is described below with reference to the
accompanying drawing in which fig 1A shows the front part of a fluid driven
down-the-hole drilling machine according to the invention. Fig 1B shows the rear part
of the down-the-hole drilling machine. Fig 2 shows a section according to 2-2 in fig
1A. Fig 3 shows a section according to 3-3 in fig 1A. Fig 4 shows a section according
to 4-4 in fig 1A.The fluid driven down-the-hole drilling machine shown in the drawing comprises a
housing 1 in the front end of which a drill bit 3 is arranged. The drill bit is connected
to the housing 1 by means of a splined coupling 11. The drill bit comprises a shaft
part 3 and a head part 51 provided with not shown hard metal bottons. The shaft part
3 and the head part 51 are connected with each other by means of a thread coupling
52. The housing 1 is at its rear end provided with an end piece 12 which by means of
a thread coupling 13 is connected to a tube string 14. The drill bit 3 is during drilling
turned through rotation of the tube string 14, end piece 12 and housing 1 via the
splined coupling 11. Fluid for the driving of the down-the-hole drilling machine is
supplied from a not shown pump via the channel 9 in the tube string. The channel 9 
thus functions as a pressure source. A hammer piston 2 is movable to-and-fro in the
housing 1. The hammer piston is provided with a piston head 15 with a first driving
surface 5. The hammer piston 2 is guided in the housing 1 by the piston head 15 and
a guide 18. The hammer piston 2 is provided with a second driving surface 16 which
is continuously pressurized via channel 17 during drilling. The to-and-fro movement
of the hammer piston is controlled by the
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Fluid driven down-the-hole drilling machine comprising a housing (1), a
hammer piston (2) movable to-and-fro in the housing and intended for impacting a

drill bit (3) arranged in the housing and a valve (4) for alternately connecting at least
one (5) of two driving surfaces (5,16) on the hammer piston to a pressure source (9)

or low pressure, 
characterized
 in that the hammer piston (2) comprises a
cylindrical part (6), that the drill bit (3) comprises a first impact surface (41), a second

impact surface (42) and an annular section (7) arranged between said impact surfaces
and surrounding a major part of said cylindrical part on the hammer piston (2),

whereby said first impact surface (41) is impacted during drilling and said second

impact surface (42) transfers impact energy from the hammer piston (2) to the drill bit
(3) when said housing (1) is fed in a direction away from the drill bit (3).
Down-the-hole drilling machine according to claim 1,
characterized
 in that the hammer piston adjacent to said cylindrical part (6)
is provided with a part (43) with reduced diameter and the drill bit (3) between said

impact surfaces (41,42) is provided with a first slot (44), through which said
cylindrical part (6) can be moved into the drill bit (3) from the side.
Down-the-hole drilling machine according to claim 2,
characterized
 in that said part (43) with reduced diameter on the hammer
piston (2) comprises two diametrically oppositely arranged plane surfaces (45) and the

drill bit comprises a second slot (46), whereby the part (43) with reduced diameter on
the hammer piston (2) at the plane surfaces (45) can pass said second slot (46) at the

same time as said cylindrical part (6) is moved into the drill bit (3) through said first
slot (44).
