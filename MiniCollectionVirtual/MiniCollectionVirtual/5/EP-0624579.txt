<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to alkyl ketene dimers and processes
for making them by the dehydrohalogenation reaction of C8 - C32
fatty acid halides with tertiary amines in inert solvents.The reaction of fatty acid chlorides with tertiary amines in
a variety of inert solvents to make alkyl ketene dimers, which
are useful as constituents of paper sizes as well as for other
applications in industry, is well known, for instance from U.S.
Patent 2,238,826 and an article by J. C. Sauer, Ketene Dimers
from Acid Halides, in the Journal of the American Chemical
Society, 69 2444-8 (1947).That reaction in the inert solvent produces alkyl ketene
dimer (AKD) in solution and tertiary amine hydrochloride as a
finely divided precipitate. Conventionally, the precipitate is
separated from the dimerization slurry by liquid/liquid aqueous
extraction of the amine hydrochloride salt. The filtrate
containing the alkyl ketene dimer and excess tertiary amine is
then stripped of solvent under reduced pressure using a rotary
evaporator and a water bath at about 80°C to give the alkyl
ketene dimer. The product typically has an alkyl ketene dimer
assay of 83% or higher and a non-volatile content up to 99.8%.Among the solvents conventionally used are benzene, toluene,
xylene, ligroin, chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene, diethyl ether,
dibutyl ether, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, and
trichloroethylene. They can be classified as:
1. alkanes and alkane petroleum fractions;2. aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, and
xylene;3. chlorinated solvents such as chlorobenzene,
dichlorobenzene, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride,
propylene dichloride, and trichloroethylene; and4. ethers such as diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether,
diisoamyl ether, and di-n hexyl ether.The conventional dimerization solvents typically used in
current industrial applications are either unacceptably toxic,
particularly benzene and toluene, or are potentially
environmentally objectionable, including the whole class of the
chlorinated solvents. Thus the need exists for an alkyl ketene
dimerization process that uses a solvent with less potential for
health and environmental problems than aromatic hydrocarbons or
halogenated solvents.However, in some of the known solvents the alkyl ketene
dimerization reaction can produce a low yield of AKD (for
instance, below 80%), an excessively viscous dimerization
mixture, or very small amine-hydrohalide crystals in the
dimerization slurry. If the dimerization reaction slurry is
either highly viscous or contains amine-hydrohalide
