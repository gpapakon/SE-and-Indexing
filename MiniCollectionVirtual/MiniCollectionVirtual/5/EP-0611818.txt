<ABSTRACT>
A phosphorous- and sulfur-containing additive and 
its use to impart anti-wear and/or antioxidant 

properties to oleaginous compositions such as fuels and 
lubricating oils, particularly power transmission 

compositions, such as automatic transmission fluids, is 
disclosed. The additive comprises a mixture of 

products formed by simultaneously reacting (1) a beta-hydroxy 
thioether, such as thiobisethanol, and (2) a 

phosphorous-containing reactant, such as tributyl 
phosphite. The reaction is carried out under reduced 

pressure conditions (e.g., -40 KPa to -100 KPa) to 
limit the amount of thioether species in said additive 

to less than about 45 mole %.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hydrocarbon 
soluble or dispersible mixture of phosphorous- and/or 
sulfur-containing reaction products, their method of 
preparation, and their utility as antiwear and anti-oxidation 
additives for oleaginous compositions such as 
fuel oils, lubricating oils, including power transmission 
fluids and crankcase oils, and to the oleaginous 
compositions in which they are contained. The lubrication of modern mechanical equipment 
requires that the lubricating oil possess excellent 
resistance to oxidation as well as the ability to 
protect metal surfaces in sliding or rolling contact 
from wear. These properties are vital to the success 
of any lubricating oil. Additives which improve the 
resistance of base lubricating oils to oxidation and 
extend the life of the equipment are of great 
importance. Oxidation in lubricating oils manifests itself as 
an increase in acidity of the oil, increase in oil 
viscosity, and formation of insoluble products which 
appear as a sludge. Acidity in the oil is detrimental 
as it eventually leads to attack of the metal parts in 
the form of rusting or corrosion. Parts made of the 
yellow metals, copper, brass and bronze are especially 
susceptible to this type of attack. Increasing oil  
 
viscosity adversely effects the efficiency of the 
equipment and can lead to the inability to circulate 
the lubricant through the mechanism. Formation of 
sludge causes deposits in oil sumps and reservoirs. 
These deposits, if formed in small lubricant 
passageways or channels, can block lubricant flow. 
Excessive viscosity increase or sludge formation can 
cause failure due to lubricant starvation. Wear results from the contact of metal surfaces 
in motion relative to each other. Under low loads and 
at high relative speeds hydrodynamic lubrication 
predominates. That is, the two metal parts are 
separated by a film of oil. This type of lubrication 
predominates in journal bearings. At higher loads or 
lower speeds the oil film fails and boundary lubrication 
becomes the main mechanism of lubrication. In 
boundary lubrication the two metal surfaces are separated 
only by a film of chemical additives. Gears 
operate in boundary lubrication mode. It is highly 
desirable that lubricating oils contain additives to 
provide for boundary lubrication conditions. Control of friction is also possible through 
modifying the lubricating oil with additives. It is 
often desirable to modify the frictional performance of 
a lubricating oil but not necessarily to
