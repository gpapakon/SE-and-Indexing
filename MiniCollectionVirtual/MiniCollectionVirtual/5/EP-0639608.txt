<ABSTRACT>
Thermocurable binders for cellulose-containing products contain tannin and a substance which liberates formaldehyde at elevated temperature. Materials produced using these binders exhibit good strength properties and low swelling values after immersion in water.

<CLAIMS>
A process for preparing materials of the group of particle boards, textile fleece,
sound and heat absorbing plates by mixing a binder with cellulose-containing

products, introducing the mixture into a mould and treating it at a temperature in the
range of from 150-210Â°C and at a pressure in the range of from 0.1 to 4 MPa,

characterized in that the binder contains tannin of the group of the procyanidines
and/or of the prodelphinidines, particularly tannin from peka nut and/or pine bark as

well as hexamethylenetetramine.
A process according to claim 1, characterized in that the portion of
hexamethylenetetramine is from 3.0 to 9 % by weight relative to tannin.
A process according to claims 1 and 2, characterized in that the binder contains up
to 50 % by weight of a novolak.
A process according to claims 1 and 2, characterized in that the binder contains up
to 20 % by weight of an at least bifunctional isocyanate compound.
A process according to claim 1, characterized in that the binder is mixed as a
powder with the cellulose-containing products.
A process according to claim 1, characterized in that the binder is sprayed as a
solution onto the cellulose-containing products.
