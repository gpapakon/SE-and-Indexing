<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to electrical
connectors and, more particularly, to arrangements
for connecting insulated, conductive members such as
tap plugs and bushings. Still more particularly, the
invention relates to bushing, cable connector and tap
plug assemblies. The invention also relates to
bushing wells and inserts and to feedthrough devices.It is known to use a T-shaped cable
connector to connect a high-voltage cable and a tap
plug to a bushing on an electrical apparatus.
Typically, the cable connector includes a housing
having therein opposed, coaxial, tapered recesses,
one of which receives a complementary tapered portion
of the bushing and the other of which receives a
complementary tapered portion of the tap plug. The
cable connector assembly also includes a lug which is
connected to the high-voltage cable, which extends
between the recesses, and which is connected to the
bushing and to the tap plug. In one known construction (see, for example, U.S.
Patent No. 4,354,721), the tap plug includes an externally
threaded portion that threads into a bore in the lug and
that has therethrough an axial bore, and the tap plug also
includes an axially movable bolt which extends through the
axial bore in the externally threaded portion and which
threads into an internally threaded bore in the bushing.Additionally, U.S. Patent No. 4,353,611 discloses
a bushing well construction in which a bushing insert is
connected to a bushing well by a threaded coupling member.
A portion of the coupling member is threaded into the
bushing well, and the bushing insert is threaded onto
another portion of the coupling member.The present invention is defined in claims 1 and claim
6 appended hereto.A preferred embodiment of the invention provides an
improved bushing, cable connector and tap plug assembly,
and also provides a method and apparatus for connecting the
cable connector and tap plug to the bushing.The assembly of an embodiment of the invention
comprises a T-shaped cable connector including a housing
defining opposed, coaxial, tapered recesses. The cable
connector also includes a lug which is connected to a high-voltage
cable and which extends into the housing between
the recesses. The assembly also comprises a bushing
adapted to be connected to 
an electrical apparatus such as a transformer. The
bushing includes a tapered outer surface
complementary with one of the recesses in the cable
connector, and the bushing has therein an internally
threaded bore.The assembly also comprises a loadbreak
reducing tap plug. The
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An electrical connector assembly comprising

a first insulated, conductive member (30) adapted to
be connected to a connector (12) having therein an

internally threaded first bore (22) , said first member
(30) including an externally threaded portion (46) which is

adapted to be threaded into the first bore (22) and which
has therein a second bore (44), and
a coupling member (64) rotationally coupled to said
first member (30) and including a first portion (66) which

is coaxial with said externally threaded portion (46) of
said first member (30), which is externally threaded and

which is adapted to be threaded into the first bore (22),
and including a second portion (68) housed in said second

bore (44).
An assembly as set forth in claim 1 and further
comprising frangible means (72) for preventing rotation of

said coupling member (64) relative to said first member
(30).
An assembly as set forth in claim 2 wherein said
frangible means includes a shear pin (72) extending between

said second portion (68) of said coupling member (64) and
said externally threaded portion (46) of said first member. 
An assembly as set forth in claim 2 or 3 wherein
threading of said externally threaded portion (46) into the

first bore (22) creates a torque between said first member
(30) and the connecter (12) and wherein said frangible

means (72) breaks when said coupling member (64) is rotated
and the above-mentioned torque reaches a predetermined

level.
An assembly as set forth in any of the preceding
claims wherein said coupling member (64) includes a socket

(70) adapted to receive a tool (56) operable for rotating
said coupling member (64).
A method for connecting an insulated, conductive
member to a connector, said method comprising the steps of


providing a connector (12) having therein an
internally threaded first bore (22), a first insulated,

conductive member (30) including an externally threaded
portion (46) which is adapted to be threaded into said

first bore (22) and which has therein a second bore (44),
and a coupling member (64) rotationally coupled to the

first member (30) and including a first portion (66) which
is coaxial with said externally threaded portion (46) of

said first member (30), which is externally threaded, and
which is adapted to be threaded into said first bore (22),

and a second portion (68) of said coupling member (64)
housed in said second bore (44),
threading said first portion (66) of said coupling 
member (64) into said first bore (22) until said externally

threaded portion (46) of said first member is aligned with
said first bore (22), and
rotating said coupling member (64) to thread said
externally threaded portion (46) of said first member (30)

into said first bore (22).
A method as set forth in claim 6 and further
comprising the steps of providing frangible means (72) for

preventing rotation of said coupling member (64) relative
to said first member (30), rotating said coupling member

(64) until said frangible means (72) breaks, and removing
said coupling member (64) from said externally threaded

portion (46) of said first member (30) and from said
connector (12).
