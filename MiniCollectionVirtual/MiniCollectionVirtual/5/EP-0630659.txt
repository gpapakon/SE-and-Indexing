<ABSTRACT>
The catheter comprises a perfusion catheter (1), a 
balloon (2) connected by its distal end to a conduit 

(7) and by its proximal end to an inflating tube (11), 
a guide wire (5) inside the conduit (7), a dilator 

member (8) in the perfusion catheter around the conduit 
and with a tapered front portion (9), and side orifices 

(12, 14) in the walls of the perfusion catheter and 
of the conduit before the balloon to allow blood flow. 

Upon usage, only the guide wire (5) and conduit (7) 
dragging the deflated balloon (2) are inserted into 

the stenosis, the balloon is then inflated a short 
while to break the stenosis and thereafter deflated 

to permit insertion of the perfusion catheter therein 
by means of the dilator member; the dilator member 

and guide wire are then withdrawn and the balloon is 
re-inflated for supporting the vessel wall.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to angioplasty perfusion catheter systems
with a perfusion channel, comprising a dilatation
balloon and a perfusion tunnel through the balloon.Catheters of that kind, such as the perfusion catheter
described in US Patent No 4581017, permit the insertion
of the depressurized balloon into a stenosis; the balloon
may then be expanded by means of a suitable fluid
supply feeding the inflating tube in order to compress
the stenosis radially outward; as the perfusion catheter
has a side orifice located before the balloon, the
blood may flow through the perfusion catheter past
the balloon and the stenosis to exit through a central
outlet at the distal end of the perfusion catheter,
which maintains continuity of blood flow in the blood
vessel, and which obviates the necessity of removing
the catheter from a stenotic artery every fiveten
seconds in order to avoid heart damage due to lack
of blood flow. Inflation times longer than fiveten
seconds become necessary when, due to the dilatation
by the balloon, flaps have been formed in the vessel,
and these flaps threaten to obstruct the vessel. Therefore,
the dilatation balloon must be inflated repeatedly
in the position of the stenosis in order to support
the flaps and press them back to the vessel wall where
they heal and bind again to the vessel wall. Sometimes,
this process is finished in a very short time; but
often, this favourable short healing is still too long
to allow complete cutting of the blood flow during
that time. That is the occasion where perfusion balloon
catheters are needed because they allow extension of
the inflation time without endangering blood supply
to the heart muscles.In order to be inserted into narrow stenosis the depressurized
balloon must be capable of reduction to a minimal
thickness around the perfusion catheter; it must 
also be capable to withstand the high inflating pressures
which are required for angioplasty. Hence, the
balloon must have walls which are as thin as possible
to assure a low profile when depressurized and which
are as strong as possible to withstand high pressure.According to the aforesaid US Patent No 4581017 the
perfusion catheter runs axially through the balloon
which is annularly fastened to the catheter by its
fore and rear ends. In that environment, the perfusion
catheter must be sufficiently stiff to constitute sort
of an inner support wall for the balloon to prevent
collapse thereof upon inflation in order to give way
to the blood flow from beginning to end of the balloon
as from
