<ABSTRACT>
Known processes for producing 2-hydroxy-4-methylthiobutyric acid (MHA) use a liquid-liquid extraction or a combined liquid/liquid and solid/liquid phase separation to isolate MHA from a reaction mixture produced by hydrolysing MMP-cyanhydrine. These processes are either costly or produce waste that is difficult to dispose of. These disadvantages are eliminated by isolating MHA by solid/liquid separation. The reaction mixture is evaporated until a MHA-containing salt residue with little or no residual water is obtained, the MHA-containing salt residue is treated with an organic solvent to produce a suspension, solid components are separated from the thus obtained suspension until a MHA-containing solution is obtained, the organic solvent is removed from the MHA-containing solution until a MHA residue is obtained and if required the MHA residue is then conditioned by water admixture. Besides high quality MHA, this process produces marketable crystalline ammonium sulphate and/or hydrogenated ammonium sulphate. This process is useful for producing feedstuff supplements.

Process for the preparation of 2-hydroxy-4-methylthiobutyric
acid (MHA), wherein MHA is isolated

from a reaction mixture which is obtained by addition
of hydrocyanic acid (HCN) to

methylmercaptopropionaldehyde (MMP) and hydrolysis
with sulfuric acid of the

methylmercaptopropionaldehyde cyanohydrin (MMP-CH)
thus obtained,

characterised in that

the reaction mixture is evaporated, an MHA-containing
salt residue having a low residual water content to

virtually no residual water content being obtained,
the MHA-containing salt residue is then treated with
an organic solvent, a suspension being obtained,
the solid constituents are then separated from the
suspension, an MHA-containing solution being

obtained,
thereafter the organic solvent is removed from the
MMA-containing solution, an MHA residue being

obtained
and thereafter the MHA residue is optionally
conditioned by addition of water.
Process according to claim 1,

characterised in that

the reaction mixture is evaporated to a residual
water content of ≤ 5%, based on MHA + oligomers.
Process according to claim 1,

characterised in that

the reaction mixture is substantially completely
freed from water.
Process according to one of claims 1 to 3,

characterised in that

the evaporation of the reaction mixture is conducted
continuously.
Process according to one of claims 1 to 4,

characterised in that

before and/or during the evaporation the reaction
mixture is subjected to an adiabatic evaporative

cooling, with application of a vacuum, down to
approximately 60°C or less, in order to remove

volatile and/or highly odorous constituents in the
reaction mixture.
