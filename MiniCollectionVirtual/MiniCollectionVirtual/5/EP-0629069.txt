<ABSTRACT>
In the digital modulation of sinusoidal carriers with combined keying between amplitude and/or phase states in which the position of the individual amplitude and phase states in the vector diagram is selected in such a manner that their associated decision circuits for unambiguous state detection do not overlap, the position of the individual amplitude and phase states in the vector diagram is arbitrarily freely selected both with respect to phase and with respect to amplitude in accordance with selected optimisation criteria of the modulation.

<CLAIMS>
System for the transmission of digital data via a large
number of discrete radio-frequency carriers situated

alongside one another (multi-carrier transmission system),
in which each individual carrier is modulated with the

data to be transmitted using a higher-order modulation
process with combined keying between amplitude states

and/or phase states, in such a manner that the decision
circles for unambiguous status recognition which are

assigned to the individual amplitude and phase states in
the vector diagram do not overlap,

characterised in that for each individual carrier the
position of the amplitude and phase states in the vector

diagram is freely chosen according to selected modulation
optimisation criteria.
