<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. serial no. 
08/020,315, filed February 19, 1993 which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. 
serial no. 07/989,674, filed December 14, 1992. This invention relates to in-situ remediation of contaminated 
soils. In one aspect, this invention relates to a novel process combining 
formation of a liquid permeable region, electroosmosis and/or 
electromigration and treatment of contaminants using biological, 
physicochemical or electrochemical means. In a further aspect, this 
invention relates to a novel process for the in-situ remediation of soils 
contaminated with toxic organic compounds and/or toxic ionic 
contaminants such as metals and radionuclides. Generally, degradation of toxic organic compounds to innocuous 
products such as CO₂ and water can be accomplished either biologically 
or physicochemically provided the treatment is carried out in a well-controlled 
environment in which key operating parameters such as 
temperature, pressure, mixing, addition of the reactants or nutrients, 
etc. are optimized. Examples of these technologies include incineration 
and its variations, supercritical water oxidation, UV/H₂O₂/ozone/ 
catalytic oxidation, reductive dehalogenation and biodegradation in an 
optimized bioreactor. However, the costs associated with these 
technologies are high for the decontamination of soil, which must first 
be excavated and then processed into a form suitable for the particular 
reactor used. The reactor constitutes a major portion of the overall cost 
in these processes due to either the extreme conditions required with 
thermal approaches or the very long holding times required in biological 
approaches. To overcome these problems, destruction of the 
contaminants needs to be done in-situ to avoid the cost and  
 
complications associated with excavation and handling, and the process 
has to be energy efficient and mild to minimize capital and operating 
costs. Various techniques have been suggested for application in 
processes for the in-situ remediation of soils contaminated with toxic 
organic compounds. Examples of such techniques include hydraulic 
fracturing, also referred to as hydrofracturing, and electroosmosis. 
However, these techniques as currently practiced suffer from 
limitations which make them commercially impractical. Hydraulic fracturing is an established oil field technology for 
increasing the production rates of oil or gas wells which has recently 
been adapted by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
