<ABSTRACT>
The present invention discloses a toner for 
electrophotography. 
This toner comprises a surface tension reducing 
agent and a binder resin. Because the melt viscosity 

of the toner at a temperature of 200
o
C is 30 poises or 
more, a toner having an excellent void resistance can 

be obtained without a worsening of the fixability and 
blocking resistance thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with an electrophotographic toner
having a specific melt viscosity and surface tension.In the electrophotography field, the method
described in U.S. Patent No. 229761 etc. is widely
used. In this method, a uniform electrostatic charge
is applied to a photoconductive insulator
(Photocondrum, etc.) by corona charge, and an
electrostatic latent image is formed by, e.g., light
using various means. Then fine powder, i.e. toner, is
electrostatically adsorbed on to the latent image
thereby to develop the image and make it visible. If
necessary, the toner picture image is transcribed onto
a recording medium such as paper, and is fixed to the
recording medium by, for example, pressure, heating,
solvent vapour blasting or irradiation of light. The
toner used for developing the electrostatic latent
image includes particles obtained by pulverizing binder
resin made of a natural or synthetic high molecular
weight substance dispersing colorant such as carbon
black. Usually the diameter of the toner particles is
about 5 to 20 µm. The toner used for the development
of an electrostatic latent image may consist of these
particles alone, or may comprise the particles mixed
with a carrier such as iron powder or glass beads.Developing methods are either one-component
developing methods or two-component developing methods.
The toner used in the former method usually contains
magnetic powder, which is frictionally charged by
friction between the wall and the developing roller
surfaces and is held on the developing roller by the
magnetic force of a magnet incorporated in the roller.
The toner is developed on to the latent image portion 
of a photoconductive insulator by the rotation of the
roller, whereby the charged toner alone adheres to the
latent image by electric attraction to carry the
development of the image.In the latter developing method, developer
consisting of toner and carrier is frictionally charged
by being mixed and stirred in a developing device. The
toner is conveyed to the latent image portion of
photoconductive insulator while being carried on the
carrier, whereupon the charged toner alone is
selectively adhered to the latent image by an electric
attraction to carry out the development of the image.A hot roller fixing method is conventionally
employed for fixing the toner, although a flash fixing
method utilizing light energy generated by a Xenon lamp
is now under development. This method has the
following favourable characteristics:
