<ABSTRACT>
What is presented is a multi-component interlacing nozzle which has not only at least two interlacing nozzles (3), but a thread guide in the form of thread-guide bodies (1) which are adjustable via an inner eccentric (2) and which fix the exact angle of entry and exit of the thread (12) into and out of the interlacing nozzle (3) and, together with the baffle plates (6), can be lifted off from the device in order to insert the thread (12) into the latter. The adjustment via the inner eccentric of the thread-guide body (1), which can be changed over in a simple way, allows the interlacing of both plain yarns, texturing yarns, industrial yarns and BCF yarns.
