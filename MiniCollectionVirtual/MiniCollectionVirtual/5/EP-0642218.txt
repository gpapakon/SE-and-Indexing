<ABSTRACT>
There is specified an amplifier circuit having bipolar transistors whose emitter resistors are embodied as pinch resistors, these pinch resistors having field electrodes for the purpose of controlling their resistance values. These field electrodes serve as inputs for the amplifier circuit, since a high input voltage swing is achieved with a low supply voltage of the amplifier circuit.
