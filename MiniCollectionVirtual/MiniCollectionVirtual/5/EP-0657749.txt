<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus suited for use in 
photostimulation and reading out of image information stemming from 
penetrating radiation in a photostimulable phosphor material, and to 
a scanner comprising said apparatus. In radiography the interior of objects is reproduced by means of 
penetrating radiation, which is high energy radiation known as 
ionizing radiation belonging to the class of X-rays, gamma-rays and 
high energy elementary particle radiation, e.g. beta-rays, electron 
beam radiation or neutron radiation. The receptor element for said 
radiation is normally a phosphor plate, panel or sheet in which the 
phosphor converts the energy of the absorbed penetrating radiation 
into fluorescent light. In US-P 3,859,527 an X-ray recording system is described wherein 
photostimulable phosphors are used having in addition to their 
immediate fluorescent light emission (prompt emission) on X-ray 
irradiation the property to store temporarily a large part of the X-ray 
energy. Said energy is set free by photostimulation in the form 
of fluorescent light different in wavelength from the light used in 
the photostimulation. In said X-ray recording system the light 
emitted on photostimulation is detected photoelectronically and 
transformed into sequential electrical signals. The basic constituents of such X-ray recording system operating 
with a photostimulable storage phosphor are : 
(1) an imaging sensor containing said phosphor in particulate form 
normally in a plate or panel, which temporarily stores some energy 
of the absorbed X-ray energy pattern, (2) a laser beam for scanningwise photostimulation, (3) a photoelectronic light detector providing analog signals that 
are converted into digital time-series signals, (4) optionally a digital image processor, (5) an electrical signal recorder, e.g. magnetic disk or tape, and (6) an image display unit operating with the obtained electrical 
signals, e.g. cathode-ray tube, or a photosensitive image recording 
material being signalwise exposed to light, e.g. a photographic  
 
silver halide emulsion film material yielding a hard copy of the 
recorded X-ray image. Different devices for reading light patterns in a scanningwise 
fashion have been described e.g. in US-P 4,258,264, 4,346,295, 
4,800,276 and published European patent applications (EP-A) 0 123 
263, 0 144 089 and 0 559 118. The lastmentioned EP-A 0 559 118 relates to an optical fiber 
cable for scanning a storage phosphor plate, said optical fiber 
cable comprising:
