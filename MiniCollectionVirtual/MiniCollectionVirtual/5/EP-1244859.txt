<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for fixing at least one taut film for mounting onto the wall or ceiling. In order to simplify the mounting process, the device is characterised by a two-part profile configuration, in which a first profile (1) has at least one mounting element (8) for receiving at least a second profile (10) in a pivotally displaceable manner and the second profile (10) has a corresponding mounting element (16). The mutual positioning of both individual profiles (1,10) allows the first profile to be mounted onto the ceiling or wall in the conventional manner and the sensitive film can be attached thereto, once the preliminary work has been completed and fixed using the second profile (10).
