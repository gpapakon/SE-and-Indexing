<ABSTRACT>
A cycle is convertible between a standard cycle configuration for normal cycling and an exercise configuration in which the cycle is propelled forwards by alternate saddle strokes, and pedal strokes, the saddle stroke comprising putting the cyclist's weight on the saddle (5) which moves downwardly driving the crank shaft (6) and bringing the two in-phase pedals (4a, 4b) upwardly, the pedal stroke comprising pressing down on both pedals (4a, 4b) to bring the saddle up again. In the exercise configuration the cycle is prevented from stalling by an arrangement whereby when the pedals (4a, 4b) are at bottom dead centre the weight on the saddle (5) is applied to the crank (6c) at an angle to the vertical to maintain forward propulsion, and whereby when the saddle is at bottom dead centre the pedals (4a, 4b) are just forward of top dead centre so as to maintain forward propulsion. In the exercise configuration the pedals may be constrained to rotate in one direction only by means of a ratchet mechanism (12, 13, 14, 16) thereby preventing the pedals hitting the cyclist on the shins.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to cycles, and in particular, to cycles in 
which rotation of the drive wheel can be effected by the application of 
force alternately to pedals and to the saddle. My earlier United Kingdom patent specification No. 2 111 924 
describes a bicycle of the type mentioned above. The bicycle is in the 
nature of an exercise bicycle intended to allow the cyclist to exercise 
muscles and joints different to those which are exercised using a 
conventional bicycle, while at the same time experiencing the pleasures 
of outdoor cycling. My earlier bicycle is not suitable for use in exercising those 
muscles and joints which are exercised by using a conventional bicycle 
and for this reason a person interested in exercising both sets of 
muscles and joints would be obliged to purchase, store and maintain two 
different types of bicycle. My earlier bicycle suffers from stalling at low speed, for 
example when going up hill. The cyclist pushes downwardly on the 
pedals so that they rotate from the top dead centre position to the 
bottom dead centre position, bringing the saddle upwards towards the 
uppermost position. The momentum of the pedals should then cause the 
pedals to move past the bottom dead centre position. Often however the 
momentum does not do so, for example because the cyclist continues to 
push downwardly on the pedals for an instant too long, or because the 
cyclist while sitting on the saddle and putting almost his entire 
weight on the saddle, nevertheless leaves the weight of his feet on the 
pedals. Once the pedals lose their momentum the directly vertically 
downward weight of the cyclist on the saddle is insufficient to bring 
the pedals past the bottom dead centre position. My earlier cycle also suffers from the disadvantage that if a 
cyclist mounts a bicycle with the saddle near but to the rear of the 
top dead centre position and the pedals near but just forward of the 
bottom dead centre position the result may be that the weight of the 
cyclist drives the saddle downwardly, causing the pedals to counter 
rotate upwardly hitting the rider unexpectedly on the shins.  
 Reference is made to DE-A-3137317 which discloses the features of the pre-characterising 
part of the present invention. The present invention provides a cycle in which rotation of the drive wheel can be 
effected by the application of force alternately to pedals and to the saddle, characterised in 
that the saddle and pedals are connected to or are connectable to the crank shaft in a 
configuration
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A cycle in which rotation of the drive wheel can be effected by the application of 
force alternately to pedals and to the saddle, characterised in that the saddle (5) and pedals 

(4a,4b) are connected to or are connectable to the crank shaft (6) in a configuration such that 
when the pedal cranks (6a,6b) and pedals (4a,4b) are at the bottom dead centre position, the 

transmission between the saddle (5) and the saddle crank (6c) is at an angle to the saddle 
crank (6c) such that the weight of the cyclist is applied to the saddle crank (6c) to propel the 

cycle in a forward direction, and when the saddle (5) is at the bottom dead centre position 
the pedal cranks (6a,6b) and pedals (4a,4b) are just forward of the top dead centre position. 
A cycle as claimed in claim 1 wherein the crank mechanism comprises a mechanism 
(12) for limiting rotation to the forward direction only. 
A cycle as claimed in claim 2 wherein said limiting mechanism is a ratchet mechanism 
(12). 
A cycle as claimed in claim 2 wherein said limiting mechanism is a clutch mechanism. 
A cycle as claimed in any of claims 2 to 4 wherein said limiting mechanism is 
releasable. 
A cycle according to any preceding claim, wherein the cycle is convertible between 
a configuration in which the saddle (5) and pedals (4a,4b) are connected to the crank shaft 

(6) generally out of phase with one another so that the cycle may be propelled forwardly by 
the application of force alternately to the pedals (4a,4b) and to the saddle (5), and a cruising 

configuration in which the saddle (5) is connected to the cycle frame (1) and the two pedals 
(4a,4b) are connected to the crank shaft (6) out of phase with one another so that the cycle 

may be cycled in the conventional manner.
