<ABSTRACT>
A multiple stage rotary compressor having a 
housing (34) with a pump cavity, an orbiting ring piston 

(20) in the cavity (36), a cylindrical post (38,42) carried 
by the housing (34) within the orbiting ring, a pair of 

vanes (60,60') engaging the outer surface (24) of the 
orbiting ring (20) to define a pair of primary pumping 

chambers in the cavity (36) and a second pair of internal 
vanes (78,90) contacting the inner surface (26) of the 

orbiting ring (20) to define a pair of secondary pumping 
chambers and a capacity controller (112-126) adapted to 

selectively disable each of the outer vanes (60) to 
establish differing compressor pump capacities depending 

upon the operating requirements of the compressor.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to refrigerant gas
compressors, particularly rotary piston compressors for
automotive climate control systems.It is well known in the art of climate controls
for automotive vehicles to provide reciprocating piston
compressors for pressurizing a refrigerant such as freon
gas. It is also known practice to use a scroll type
compressor, which tends to reduce vibrations caused by
reciprocating pistons and to provide higher volumetric and
mechanical efficiency. The dynamic behavior of such
conventional compressors is described in the literature;
e.g., a paper entitled A Study On Dynamic Behavior Of A
Scroll Compressor, published in the 1986 International
Compressor Engineering Conference at Purdue University, Vol.
3, August 4-7, 1986. The authors are Ishii, Fukushima, Sano
and Sawai.With the introduction of an alternate refrigerant
commonly known as "R134A", which may replace freon gas as a
refrigerant in automotive vehicle air conditioning systems,
it is necessary to provide higher operating pressures. This
tends to introduce problems associated with sealing the
refrigerant. The use of this alternate refrigerant also
makes it necessary to provide a higher volumetric efficiency
than the efficiencies associated with compressors used with
Freon gas and to deal with higher temperature of the inlet
gas.An example of a compressor that is adapted
especially for use with "R134A" refrigerant gas is disclosed
in U.S. Patent No. 5,015,161, which is assigned to the
assignee of the present invention and forms the basis of the preamble of claim 1. The '161 patent
describes a refrigerant gas compressor having high overall
operating efficiency with minimal internal leakage
notwithstanding the presence of higher compression levels.
The compressor of the '161 patent comprises a two stage 
rotary ring piston which reduces the pressure differential
across the rotary mechanism thereby reducing sealing
problems. The rotary piston in the structure of the '161
patent is an orbiting piston which cooperates with a
compression chamber and an internal cylindrical post to
define two first stage compression chambers and two second
stage pressure chambers. The output of the first stage
supplies the inlet of the second stage. The orbiting ring
piston, which is located between the cylindrical post and
the housing wall, rotates about an axis that is offset from
the axis of the post as the outer surface of the orbiting
ring piston contacts the inner surface of the housing and
the inner surface of the orbiting ring

<CLAIMS>
A two stage rotary gas compressor comprising:

a housing (34), a compressor cavity (36) in said housing
having an internal cylindrical surface with a first axis;
a post (38,42) substantially coaxial with said first axis
and having a cylindrical surface (24) spaced radially from

said internal surface and a transverse slot (44);
a ring piston (20) mounted for orbital movement
about a second axis displaced radially from said first axis,

said ring piston (20) being located in said cavity between
said internal surface and said post (38), said piston having

an outer cylindrical surface (24) in contact with said
internal surface and an inner cylindrical surface (26) in

contact with said post (38);
a vane slot (58) in said housing (34), an outer vane (60)
mounted for movement in said slot (58) into contact with

said outer cylindrical surface (24) of said piston (20);
an inner vane (90) mounted in said transverse slot (44)
for movement into contact with said inner cylindrical

surface (26);
a first stage inlet passage adapted to be opened and
closed by movement of said outer vane (60) in said housing

slot (58);
a second stage inlet passage adapted to be opened and
closed by movement of said inner vane (90) in said

transverse slot (44);
a first stage discharge port (52) in said housing (34)
communicating with said second stage inlet passage;

   characterised in that the compressor further comprises;

means (112, 126) for disabling said outer vane (60) to
prevent its movement into contact with said outer

cylindrical surface (24),
a communicating passage (124) communicating between the
said first stage inlet passage and the said second stage

inlet passage, and
a valve assembly including a valve element (112) movable
in a first direction to block the communicating passage 

(124) and in a second direction to open the communicating
passage (124), whereby the capacity of the compressor can be

reduced and the second stage inlet passage can be connected
to the first stage inlet passage.
A compressor as claimed in claim 1, wherein the valve
element comprises a valve spool (112) and the means for

disabling said outer vane (60) comprise a detent portion
(134) of the valve spool (112).
A compressor as claimed in claim 2, wherein the means for
disabling said outer vane comprise a solenoid actuator (126)

for moving the said valve spool (112).
A compressor as claimed in claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein the
valve assembly comprises valve lands on said valve element

(112) adapted to block said communicating passage (124) when
said valve element is moved away from said outer vane (60).
A compressor as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims, wherein the outer vane (60) constitutes one of two

such vanes (60, 60') carried by said housing (34) and
adapted to move into engagement with the outer cylindrical
