<ABSTRACT>
A method and an apparatus for coating tanks and pipe systems internally in that, first, a tank (1) is filled with a liquid (3) consisting of water to which is admixed an acid (10). Oxide coating on the internal surface is removed through heating and circulating the liquid (3) through a filter (4). The liquid (3) is neutralized through the admixture of a base (12). Approximately one fifth of the neutralized liquid (3) is drawn off, the tank (1) being refilled with a concentrated metal solution (15). The temperature, acidity and metal concentration of the liquid (3) are maintained close to constant through supplying heat, acid (10) or base (12), and concentrated metal solution (15), respectively. Air or vapour is supplied through a blowing pipe (5) and creates stirring, surplus liquid and gas being drained through a pipe (16). When the internal surface of the tank (1) has received a coating having the desired thickness, the process is interrupted in that the liquid (3) is cooled and drained.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for 
precipitation coating of internal surfaces in tanks and pipe 
systems. Usually, coating of internal surfaces in tanks and pipe 
systems has the purpose of protecting the base material 
against corrosion or mechanical wear and tear. In some cases 
it is desirable to protect the content of tanks and pipes, 
such as foodstuffs, against undesirable effects from the 
base material. A coating may be applied in a plurality of ways. As known, 
paint is applied by means of a brush, a roller or a sprayer. 
Metal coating is e.g. applied through thermical spraying, 
through electrolysis or through precipitation of metals from 
a metal solution (compare e.g. GB-A-1 209 037 or DE-A-2 815 761). 
Also, various forms of applying metal 
vapour in vacuum are known. On a base material such as steel, metal coatings of e.g. 
chrome and nickel alloys are preferred for corrosion 
protection and resistance to wear and tear. Where a 
particularly large resistance to wear and tear is required, 
coatings of various carbides are used. When immerging an object into a metalliferous solution, 
metal can precipitate on the surface of the object. In order 
to achieve a plain and smooth precipitation, temperature,  
 
acidity and concentration must be controlled. Good 
preliminary work, such as cleaning and removal of oxide 
coating (compare e.g. EP-A-0 380 169), is important in order to obtain good adherence to 
the base material. The treatment may involve immersion into 
up to tens of baths having different chemical composition. 
When the object is moved from one bath to the next, the 
surface thereof is often very reactive. One has to work such 
that corrosive attacks do not arrise when the object is out 
of the baths. Chemical coating through precipitation is difficult to 
accomplish on very large objects, i.a. because it requires 
many and large vessels to immerse the object into. Repair 
treatment involving disassembling, transport and immersion 
of tanks of e.g. two hundred cubic metres, is nearly 
unthinkable with prior art technique. An object of the invention is to provide a method 
for precipitation coating of internal surfaces in 
tanks and pipe systems without immersion into vessels. Also, 
it is an object that surfaces to be coated are not subjected 
to corrosive environment between the various steps of the 
process. The objects are achieved by the processes as defined in claims 1 and 3 in that the object to be coated 
internally is filled with a liquid, the chemical composition, 
acidi

A method for metal coating internal cleaned surfaces of 
tanks and pipe systems through precipitation of metal from a 

metalliferous liquid, 
characterized 
in
 that a tank (1) first is filled with a liquid (3) 
consisting of water to which is admixed an acid (10), and 

wherein the liquid (3), now acid, is heated and circulated 
through a filter (4) until the internal surface of the tank 

(1) is free from oxide coating, whereafter a base (12) is 
supplied until the liquid (3) is neutralized; and whereafter 

approximately one fifth of the neutralized liquid (3) is 
drawn off and replaced by a concentrated metal solution 

(15), whereafter the liquid (3), now metalliferous, is 
stirred, simultaneously as the temperature, acidity and 

metal concentration of the liquid (3) are maintained 
constant, or close to constant, supplying to the liquid (3) 

respectively heat, acid (10) or base (12) and refilling 
concentrated metal solution (15) in step with precipitation of 

metal on the internal surface of the tank (1), simultaneously as 
surplus liquid and gas are drawn off; and wherein, finally, the 

liquid (3) is cooled and drained when the precipitation has given 
a metal coating of the desired thickness.

cleaning the surfaces to be coated by contacting them
