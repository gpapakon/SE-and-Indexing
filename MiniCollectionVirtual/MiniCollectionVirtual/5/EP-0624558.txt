<ABSTRACT>
In the process for making ceramic microstructures from polymer precursors, the precursor materials are first prepared, then introduced into preformed structures in a intrinsically stable mould material, after which the organic constituents are finally decomposed by pyrolysis.

A process for producing ceramic microstructures
having a surface profile depth of less than 1 µm,

measured by the atomic force method, which comprises
first preparing a polymeric precursor material, then

shaping it by introduction into structures of
inherently stable mold insert material, with the

inherently stable mold insert materials used being
materials which have sufficient strength for

structuring and are such that a high molding
accuracy is achieved, and the shaped precursor

material being made infusible by chemical
crosslinking or by crosslinking with the aid of

actinic radiation and finally being pyrolyzed.
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
structuring of the inherently stable mold insert

material is carried out by means of the LIGA method
in which a combination of lithography,

electroforming and molding is used.
The process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the
inherently stable mold insert materials used are

polytetrafluoroethylene, polycarbonate and
polymethyl methacrylate.
The process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3,
wherein the chemical crosslinking is carried out by

means of hydrolysis or actinic radiation. 
The process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4,
wherein the precursor materials used are polysilazanes,

polycarbosilanes, polysilanes or polysiloxanes,
or else polymers which do not contain

silicon, such as borazines or organoaluminum polymers,
or mixtures of all these, preferably polysilazanes,

polycarbosilanes, polyborosilanes and
polysilanes, particularly preferably polyvinylsilazanes.
The process as claimed in claim 5, wherein
polyvinylsilazane is used as a solution in

tetrahydrofuran having a solvent content of 20 to
35% by weight.
The process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 6,
wherein the preparation of the precursor materials

is carried out by melting, dilution with solvent or
thickening.
The process as claimed in claim 7, wherein for the
preparation of the precursor material the solvent

content is reduced to an amount in the range from 20
to 35% by weight by passing in inert gas.
The process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 8,
wherein for the preparation of the precursor

materials active and non-active fillers, such as
finely divided ceramic or metal powder, are added in

an amount of from 0 to 60% by volume, based on the
total volume of the mixture.
The process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 9,
wherein the shaping of the microstructures is carried

out by introducing the precursor material into
the structured mold insert by casting, pressing,

spraying, injection molding, micro-injection molding
or stamping and the solvent is then removed by

outward diffusion. 
The process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 10,
wherein the pyrolysis is carried out in a gastight

firing furnace in vacuo or in an inert or reactive
gas atmosphere, with the shaped microstructures

being heated to a temperature in the range from 700
to 2000°C, preferably from 900 to 1400°C, at a

heating rate of from 0.1 to 10 K/min and the final
temperature then being kept constant for a period of

from 0 to 180 min, preferably from 15 to 120 min.
The process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 11,
wherein the resulting ceramic gives carbides,

nitrides, borides, oxides and mixtures thereof,
preferably elemental combinations of Si, N, C, O, B

and Al, with at least two of these elements being
present in the ceramic.
Use of microstructures produced by a process as
claimed in any one of claims 1 to 12 as micro-separation

elements for application in processes for
separating mixtures of materials in chemically

aggressive liquids at high temperatures.
Use of microstructures produced by a process as
claimed in any one of claims 1 to 12 as components

in fuel injection technology.
Use of microstructures produced by a process as
claimed in any one of claims 1 to 12 in sensor

technology in the measurement of physical, in particular
optical, mechanical or electrical, and

chemical parameters.
Use of microstructures produced by a process as
claimed in any one of claims 1 to 12 in components

for microwave technology and in components for
integrated optics.
Use of microstructures produced by a process as 
claimed in any one of claims 1 to 12 in components

for microsystems, in particular actuators and sensors.
