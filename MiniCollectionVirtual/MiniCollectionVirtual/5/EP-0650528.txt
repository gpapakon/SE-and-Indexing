<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a technique designed to 
facilitate study of the individual members of populations 
of nucleic acid sequences, particularly where the 
individual members of such populations may be present in 
widely varying amounts. This technique permits indexing of 
sequences. Situations are increasingly arising in which it is 
necessary to study complex nucleic acid or polynucleotide 
populations. For example, it is now widely appreciated 
that an invaluable resource could be created if the entire 
sequence of the genomes of organisms such as man were 
determined and the information available. The magnitude of 
such a task should not, however, be underestimated. Thus, 
the human genome may contain as many as 100,000 genes (a 
very substantial proportion of which may be expressed in 
the human brain: Sutcliffe, Ann. Rev. Neurosci. 11:157-158 
(1988)). Only a very small percentage of the stock of 
human genes has presently been explored, and this largely 
in a piecemeal and usually specifically targeted fashion. There has been much public debate about the best means of 
approaching human genome sequencing. Brenner has argued 
(CIBA Foundation Symposium 149:6 (1990)) that efforts 
should be concentrated on cDNAs produced from reverse  
 
transcribed mRNAs rather than on genomic DNA. This is 
primarily because most useful genetic information resides 
in the fraction of the genome which corresponds to mRNA, 
and this fraction is a very small part of the total (5% or 
less). Moreover, techniques for generating cDNAs are also 
well known. On the other hand, even supposing near perfect 
recovery of cDNAs corresponding to all expressed mRNAs, 
some potentially useful information will be lost by the 
cDNA approach, including sequences responsible for control 
and regulation of genes. Nonetheless, the cDNA approach at 
least substantially reduces the inherent inefficiencies 
resulting from analysis of repeated sequences and/or noncoding 
sequences in an approach which depends upon genomic 
DNA sequencing. Recently, the results of a rapid method for identifying and 
characterising new cDNAs has been reported (Adams, M.D. et 
al., Science 252, 1991, pp 1651-1656). Essentially, a 
semi-automated sequence reader was used to produce a single 
read of sequence from one end of each of a number of cDNAs 
picked at random. It was shown, by comparing the nucleic 
acid sequences of the cDNAs (or the protein sequences 
produced by translating the nucleic acid sequence of the 
cDNAs) to each other and to known
