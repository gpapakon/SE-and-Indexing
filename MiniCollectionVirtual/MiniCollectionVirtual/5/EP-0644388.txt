<ABSTRACT>
A low temperature rectification process and apparatus in which a compressed 
gaseous mixture, for instance air, is rectified to produce oxygen in liquid form 

which is then pumped by pump 96 to a delivery pressure. The thus pressurised 
oxygen is vaporised within a main heat exchanger 24. In order to effect the 

vaporization, a stream 20 of high pressure air flows through the main heat 
exchanger 24 countercurrently to the oxygen stream. In order to minimize 

thermodynamic irreversibility within the main heat exchanger 24 above a pinch 
point temperature thereof, a portion of the high pressure air stream is removed 

from the main heat exchanger at or near the pinch point temperature and is 
further compressed in a compressor 34 and reintroduced into the main heat 

exchanger 24 at a temperature higher than that at which the pinch point occurs. 
Either the balance of the high pressure air stream or another flow of compressed 

air is removed from the main heat exchanger 24 and is cooled to a temperature 
suitable for its rectification in expansion turbine 38. Such removal reduces 

thermodynamic irreversibility within the main heat exchanger below the pinch 
point temperature.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to air separation.Components of gaseous mixtures having different volatilities are separated from
one another by a variety of well-known cryogenic rectification processes. Such
processes utilize a main heat exchanger to cool the gaseous mixture to a
temperature suitable for rectification after the gaseous mixture has been
compressed. The rectification is carried out in distillation columns incorporating
trays or packing (structured or random) to bring liquid and gaseous phases of
the mixture into intimate contact and thereby separate the components of the
mixture in accordance with their volatilities. In order to avoid the use of a
product compressor to produce the lower volatility component at a delivery
pressure, the distillation is carried out such that the lower volatility component
is produced in liquid form. The lower volatility component in the liquid form is
then pumped to the delivery pressure and vaporized within the main heat
exchanger.An important cryogenic rectification process concerns the separation of air. Air
contains a lower volatility component, oxygen, and a higher volatility
component, nitrogen. In the production of pressurized oxygen gas, a liquid
oxygen product of the cryogenic rectification of air is pumped to a delivery
pressure and heated by incoming air in a heat exchanger from which it emerges
as a pressurized gas. Typically, at least part of the air feed must be pressurized
to a much higher pressure than the oxygen in order to provide the appropriate
temperature difference in the heat exchanger. For instance, when an oxygen
product, which amounts to about 21% of the incoming air by volume is pumped
to 42.8 bar(a), about 35-40% of the incoming air is compressed to about 74.5
bar(a). This requirement is a result of the non-conformity in the temperature and
the heat transferred between the feed air and the product streams in some parts
of the main heat exchanger, which affects the warming of the products and the 
cooling of the air. Concurrently, wide temperature differences exist
between the air and the product streams in part of the heat exchanger.
This is known as thermodynamic irreversibility and increases the energy
requirement of the process.EP-A-0-504029 and EP-A-0-505 812 both relate to processes in which
liquid oxygen is pumped from a rectification column through a main heat
exchanger in countercurrent heat exchange with air and is thereby
vaporized. In both cases all compression of air is performed upstream of
the main heat exchanger.All the
