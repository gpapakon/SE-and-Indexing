<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed to a low-fat 
processed cheese manufactured from skim milk cheese. In 

the method of the invention, a mixture of skim milk 
cheese, a low viscosity levoglucosan as bulking agent and an emulsifying 

salt is provided. The mixture is heated to an elevated 
temperature of from about 175° F. to about 240° F. The 

mixture is held at the elevated temperature for a period 
of from about 0.5 minutes to about 8 minutes to provide a 

homogeneous molten cheese mass. The cheese mass is then 
packaged to provide a low fat processed cheese. The low-fat 

processed cheese of the invention is particularly 
suitable for the manufacture of processed cheese slices.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a high 
non-fat processed cheese and to a method for manufacture 
thereof. More particularly, the invention is directed to 
a processed cheese which is prepared from skim milk 
cheese and a low viscosity bulking agent to provide a 
non-fat processed cheese which is similar in body and 
texture to processed cheese products prepared from 
natural cheese Processed cheese products containing a 
substantial level of fat are well known in the food 
industry and Standards of identity have been established 
by the United States Food and Drug Administration for 
several types of processed cheese products. In accordance with the Standards of Identity, 
pasteurized processed cheese is the food prepared by 
comminuting and mixing, with the aid of heat, one or more 
natural cheeses of the same or two or more varieties. 
Specifically excluded from use in the preparation of 
pasteurized processed cheese, however, are cream cheese, 
neufchatel cheese, cottage cheese, low fat cottage 
cheese, cottage cheese dry curd, cooked cheese, hard 
grating cheese, semisoft part-skim cheese, part-skim 
spice cheese and skim milk cheese. The pasteurized 
processed cheese is prepared by heating the natural 
cheese with an emulsifying agent while mixing into a 
homogeneous plastic mass. During its preparation, 
pasteurized processed cheese is heated for not less than 
30 seconds at a temperature of not less than 65°C (150° F). The 
moisture content of pasteurized processed cheese cannot 
be more than 43%, except that the moisture content of 
pasteurized process washed curd cheese or pasteurized 
process colby cheese cannot be more than 40%. The  
 
moisture content of pasteurized process Swiss cheese or 
pasteurized process Gruyere cheese is not more than 44%. 
The moisture content of pasteurized process Limburger 
cheese is not more than 51%. The fat content (dry basis) of pasteurized 
processed cheese cannot be less than 47% except that the 
fat content of pasteurized process Swiss cheese is not 
less than 43% and the fat content of pasteurized process 
Gruyere cheese is not less than 45%. The emulsifying agents prescribed for use in 
the manufacture of pasteurized process cheese are one or 
any mixture of two or more of the following: monosodium 
phosphate, disodium phosphate, dipotassium phosphate, 
trisodium phosphate, sodium metaphosphate (sodium 
hexametaphosphate), sodium acid pyrophosphate, 
tetrasodium pyrophosphate, sodium aluminum phosphate, 
sodium citrate, potassium citrate, calcium

<CLAIMS>
A method for the manufacture of a low-fat 
cheese comprising: 


(a) providing a mixture comprising a skim milk 
cheese, a low viscosity levoglucosan and an 

emulsifying salt; 
(b) heating the mixture to an elevated 
temperature in the range of from 79° to 116°C (175°F. 

to 240°F); 
(c) holding the mixture at said elevated 
temperature for a period of from 0.5 

minutes to 8 minutes to provide a 
homogeneous molten cheese mass; and 
(d) packaging the cheese mass to provide a 
low-fat processed cheese. 
A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein the 
skim milk cheese is present at a level of from 20 to 

55% by weight, the levoglucosan is present at a level 
of from 2% to 12% by weight and the emulsifying salt 

is present at a level of from 1% to 3% by weight. 
A method as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 
wherein the mixture is heated to a temperature of 

from 102° to 116°C (215°F to 240°F) for a period of from 1 to 3 
minutes. 
A method as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims wherein milk solids non fat are 

present in the mixture at a level of from 3% to 30% 
by weight. 
A method as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims wherein corn syrup solids having a 

DE of from 20 to 36 is present in the mixture at a  
 

level of from 1% to 12% by weight. 
A method as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims wherein whey solids are present in 

the mixture at a level of from 0% to 8% by weight. 
A method as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims wherein sodium chloride is present 

in the mixture at a level of from 0.5% to 2% by 

weight. 
A method as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims wherein sorbic acid is present in
