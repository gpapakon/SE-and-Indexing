<ABSTRACT>
A screen printer (10) having at least one print 
head (80) mounted underneath an elongate generally 

horizontal drive assembly (56,58) to enable the head (80) 
to be moved to and fro across a print screen (26). The 

elongate horizontal drive assembly (56,58) comprises two 
separate elongate horizontal drives (56,58) spaced apart 

transversely of the directions of the to and fro movement. 
The print head (80) is attached to respective moveable 

parts (82,84) of the two elongate horizontal drives 
(56,58).

<DESCRIPTION>
In a previously proposed screen printer, a printer 
head is mounted underneath an elongate horizontal drive 
assembly to enable the head to be moved to and fro across a 
print screen. The elongate horizontal drive assembly is in the 
form of a single-extrusion rodless cyclinder assembly extending 
along the intended direction of to and fro movement. The print 
head is mounted underneath this single extrusion. As a result, 
there is a certain degree of instability as regards rocking 
movement of the print head. It is an aim of a first aspect of the present 
invention to reduce the susceptability of the print head to 
rocking movement. Accordingly, a first aspect of the present invention 
is directed to a screen printer having at least one print head 
mounted underneath an elongate generally horizontal drive 
assembly to enable the head to be moved to and fro across a 
print screen, in which the elongate horizontal drive assembly 
comprises two separate elongate horizontal drives spaced apart 
transversely of the directions of the to an fro movement, with 
the print head attached to respective moveable parts of the two 
elongate horizontal drives. Advantageously, each elongate drive comprises a 
rodless cylinder. Preferably, the or each print head is provided with 
at least one generally vertical drive connected to lower and 
raise an associated squeegee of the print head which vertical  
 
drive is positioned centrally between the two elongate 
horizontal drives. The vertical drive may be provided with down limit 
adjustment means which serve to adjust the down limit of 
movement of the squeegee. Because there is only one down limit of a central 
vertical drive, rather than two spaced apart along the 
squeegee, there is no balancing required between two down-limit 
adjustments to ensure that the squeegee is parallel and remains 
parallel, with the screen. The squegee may be inhibited from rocking by means 
of slideways which are preferably positioned on the outsides 
of the elongate horizontal drives. In the event that the screen printer is provided with 
more than one screen, so that successive different images of 
respective different colours can be printed in registration 
with one another on a given article, for example a T-shirt, it 
is important for each screen to be brought precisely into 
registration with the position occupied by the screen of the 
immediately preceeding image. Hitherto, a multiple-screen screen printer has been 
made with a multiplicity of print screens angularly spaced 
apart

<CLAIMS>
A screen printer (10) having at least one print 

head (80) mounted underneath an elongate generally 
horizontal drive assembly (56,58) to enable the head (80) 

to be moved to and fro across a print screen (26), 
characterised in that the elongate horizontal drive 

assembly (56,58) comprises two separate elongate horizontal 
drives (56,58) spaced apart transversely of the directions 

of the to and fro movement, with the print head (80) 
attached to respective moveable parts (82,84) of the two 

elongate horizontal drives (56,58). 
A screen printer according to claim 1, 
characterised in that each elongate drive comprises a 

rodless cylinder (56,58). 
A screen printer according to claim 1 or claim 2, 
characterised in that the or each print head (80) is 

provided with at least one generally vertical drive (100) 
connected to lower and raise an associated squeegee (90,92) 

of the print head (80) which vertical drive (100) is 
positioned centrally between the two elongate horizontal 

drives (56,58). 
A screen printer according to claim 3, 
characterised in that the vertical drive (100) is provided 

with down limit adjustment means (108) which serve to 
adjust the down limit of movement of the squeegee (90,92). 
A screen printer according to claim 3 or claim 4, 
characterised in that the squeegee (90,92) is inhibited 

 
from rocking by means of slideways (104) which are 

preferably positioned on the outsides of the elongate 
horizontal drives (56,58). 
A screen printer (10) comprising a plurality of 
printer screen frames (26) angularly spaced apart around a 

screen support (12), and a plurality of boards (28) over 
which extend the articles (30) to be printed when the 

printer (10) is in use and which are angularly spaced apart 
around a board support (14) which is generally concentric 

with the screen support (12) so that respective screen 
frames (26) are in registration with at least some of the 

boards (28), and indexing means (32) which enable the 
screen support (12) and the board support (14) to be 

indexed relative to one another through successive angles 
each equal to (360/n)Â°, where n is an integral number, in 

which both the screen support (12) and the board support 
(14) are cast precision-machined components provided with 

fixed non-adjustable precision located interengaging 
formations (34) which enable the two supports (12,14) to be 

precisely located relative to one another after each 
indexing. 
A screen printer (10) comprising a plurality of 
printer screen frames (26) angularly spaced apart around a 

screen support (12), and a plurality of boards (28) over 
which extend the articles (30) to be printed when the 

printer (10) is in use and which are angularly spaced apart 
around a board support (14) which is generally concentric 

with the screen support (12) so that respective screen 
 

frames (26) are in registration with at least some of the 
boards (28), in which generally vertical drive means (18) 

are provided to enable the screen support (12) and the 
board support (14) to be moved apart in a generally 

vertical direction to enable those two supports (12,14) to 
be indexed relative to one another, and in which a linear 

transducer (260) is connected directly or indirectly to the 
generally vertical drive means (18), and the linear 

transducer (260) and the drive means (18) are connected to 
a programmable computer (300) to enable the snap height 

between the screen frames (26) and the boards (28) to be 
adjusted by means of the computer (300).
