A magnet for magnetic resonance imaging comprising a pair 
of poles (7) supported on a yoke and juxtaposed to define between 

them an imaging volume (5), the poles (7) having opposed end faces (11) 
which each include shim pieces set therein, which shim pieces (12,13) are 

adapted and arranged to be positionally adjustable in directions (14) 
parallel with the longitudinal axis of the poles for the purpose of 

homogenising the magnetic field in the imaging volume.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to magnets and more especially it
relates to magnets of the kind used for magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) in medical applications.The theory and operation of MRI is well known and will not
therefore be discussed in detail herein. It should be emphasised
however that in order to create acceptable images, a magnetic
field must be provided which affords a predetermined volume of
highly homogeneous magnetic flux. This volume, which is usually
called the imaging volume, might be considered to be spherical
and typically of about 40cm diameter wherein the magnetic flux
is substantially homogeneous to within one hundred parts per
million or less of non-uniformity (Î”B/B).The magnets used for MRI may be permanent magnets or
electro magnets which may employ cryogenic techniques to
produce strong magnetic fields, typically .2T to 2T.
Unfortunately, with all presently known magnets, the magnet
alone, i.e. the bare magnet will not produce a magnetic field in the
imaging volume which is sufficiently homogeneous. This is
because of inevitable non-uniformities inherent in a magnet's
design, the materials and tolerances of the component parts from
which it is made and external influences which affect the magnet's
field during operation. It is therefore necessary to correct for
these magnetic flux non-uniformities, a process known as
shimming. Shimming is a technique well known to those skilled in the
art and various shimming methods may be used, perhaps in
combination. For example, electrical shimming may be used
which comprises positioning specially designed copper coils, often
with complex geometries within the magnet and energising the
coils with a predetermined current. The magnetic field thereby
produced from these coils is superimposed on the field produced
by the bare magnet so as to create a substantially homogeneous
magnetic field in the imaging volume.Although electrical shimming is a very powerful technique,
it carries a major cost penalty. The additional cost of coils and the
requirement for a very stable power supply often mitigates
against the use of electrical shimming .An alternative shimming method called passive shimming
comprises positioning discrete pieces of magnetic material which
may either be ferro-magnetic or permanently magnetised near
the imaging volume in predetermined positions in order to
constrain the field of the bare magnet so as to make it more
homogeneous. Such method is known from WO 84/00611. The main shortcoming of passive shimming is that
relatively large

A magnet for magnetic resonance imaging comprising a pair
of poles (7) supported on a yoke (24) and juxtaposed to define

between them an imaging volume, the poles (7) having opposed
end faces (11) which each include shim pieces (12, 13) set therein,

which shim pieces (12, 13) are adapted and arranged to be
