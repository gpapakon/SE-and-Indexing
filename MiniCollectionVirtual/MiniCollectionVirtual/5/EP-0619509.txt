<ABSTRACT>
In order to control the direction and position of a collimation mirror (5) of a head-up sight, holographic elements (6, 7) are used which deflect part of the light reflected by the mirror to sensors (9, 10) located outside the field of view (4).

<CLAIMS>
Device for controlling the position and the
orientation of a movable mirror (5) of an optical system,

which moveable mirror is used to reflect a light beam
producing images which are observed by a user, characterized

in that it includes at least one holographic element
(6, 7) which is arranged on a small part of the mirror

and thus deviates a small part of the light beam, after
reflection on the mirror, towards a corresponding sensor

(9, 10) arranged outside the field of view relating to
the mirror (4), and in that the Bragg angle of each

holographic element is the angle (A) formed between the
direction (19) in which the mirror would, in the absence

of the said holographic element, reflect the incident
rays, and the direction (20) of the corresponding sensor.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that each holographic element is recorded on a layer of

photosensitive material deposited on a substrate (17)
which is transparent to the wavelengths used and is

adhesively bonded to the mirror.
Device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that each sensor (9, 10) is an

optoelectronic sensor of the type having four quadrants.
Device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the mirror is a combiner mirror.
Device according to Claim 4, characterized in
that the combiner mirror is a spherical collimation

mirror.
Device according to Claim 4 or 5, characterized
in that it forms part of a head-up display. 
Device according to Claim 6, characterized in
that each sensor is connected to a device (8, 11) for

slaving the position and/or orientation of the moveable
mirror or the position of the image source.
Device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that, in correspondence with each

holographic element, the image source (1) includes, close
to the edge of its working surface, a small region

covered with a phosphor emitting in the infrared.
