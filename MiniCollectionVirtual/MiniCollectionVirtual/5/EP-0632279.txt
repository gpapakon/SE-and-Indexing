<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an appliance for measuring the duration of a time interval between a start signal (D) and a signal marking the end of the interval (F) to be measured comprising:   - a digital circuit equipped with a first and a second clock (C1, C2), able to count the number of clock pulses lying between the start signal (D) and the clock beat following the end-of-interval signal (F); - an analog circuit, able to measure the time separating the-start-of-interval signal (D) from the following clock pulse and to measure the time separating the end-of-interval signal (F) from the following clock pulse, - a processing circuit, able to determine the duration of the time interval from the data supplied by the digital circuit and those supplied by the analog circuit, first of all converted into digital data.   Application especially in the field of robotics.
