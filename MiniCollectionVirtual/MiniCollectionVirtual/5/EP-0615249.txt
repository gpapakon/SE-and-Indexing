<ABSTRACT>
A DRAM provided with special function modes of a 
plurality of different types and capable of discriminating 

the modes and entering a selected one thereof 
without conflicting with a conventional standardized 

WCBR entry method. Such a DRAM comprises a counter circuit 
FF for counting the number of times a /WE signal is 

made active while a /RAS signal is active after the 
start of a /WCBR cycle and an entry circuit (181, 182) 

that discriminates the special function modes and enters 
the DRAM in a selected one thereof according to the 

obtained count.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a semiconductor dynamic
random access memory (DRAM) and, more particularly, it
relates to a circuit adapted to discriminate special
function modes of a plurality of different types with
which it is provided and entering the memory in a
selected one of them.Known specific function modes for a DRAM typically
include parallel bit test modes. An 8-bit parallel test
mode and a 16-bit parallel test mode are provided as
standardized modes for a 4M DRAM adapted for 4M-word ×
1-bit and a 16M DRAM adapted for 16M-word × 1-bit
respectively.The operation of entering a DRAM of the above identified
category in a parallel bit test mode is normally
carried out in a WCBR cycle as illustrated in waveform
in FIG. 1 of the accompanying drawings, although this
technique is by no means usual for entering DRAMs of
other categories. A WCBR cycle is a WE·CAS before RAS
cycle where a /WE (write enable signal) and a /CAS
(column address strobe signal) are made to become active
before a /RAS (row address strobe signal). For a WCBR
cycle, the address inputs A0 to A12 and the write data
input Din of the DRAM may be held in any state whereas
its data output Dout is always kept in an open state
(high impedance state).When a DRAM is provided with two or more than two 
special function modes, it has been a common practice to
discriminate them by specifying a state for each of the
address inputs in a WCBR cycle as illustrated in FIG. 2
of the accompanying drawings.However, the latter entry method of specifying a
state for each of the address inputs in a WCBR cycle can
inevitably restrict the use of the former method (which
may keep the address inputs in any state) to the disadvantage
of the user and hence is currently not popular.On the other hand, in a WCBR cycle which is a
currently normally used for entering a DRAM in a special
function modes out of a number of special function modes
with which it is provided, the memory device is automatically
refreshed by the internal row address counter of
the DRAM. Contrary to this, with the latter entry
method of specifying just a mode for each of the address
inputs of a DRAM, its row address buffer needs to be
operated and therefore the method is not compatible with
the technique of automatic refresh using the internal
address counter unless the entry circuit of the DRAM is
modified to a considerable extent.Thus, with a DRAM provided with special function
modes of two or more than two different types, the conventional
method of discriminating the special function
modes
