<ABSTRACT>
The pedal assembly includes a pedal-assembly support (2) fixed to a bulkhead (4) dividing the passenger cell (6) from the engine compartment (7) of the vehicle at the level of a through aperture (5) in the bulkhead (4). A clutch pedal (15) and a brake pedal are mounted pivotably about an articulation pin (17) on the pedal-assembly support (2), inside the passenger cell (6). A control device (13, 25) is fixed inside the engine compartment (7). A sound-proofing wall (12) is fixed to the bulkhead (4), at the level of the through aperture (5). The wall (12) surrounds the pedal-assembly support (2) inside the passenger cell (6) and includes at least one deformable part (27), preferably bellows-shaped, surrounding the pedal (15), from its articulation pin (17) up to a region following which the deformable wall part (27) is fixed to the pedal (15).
