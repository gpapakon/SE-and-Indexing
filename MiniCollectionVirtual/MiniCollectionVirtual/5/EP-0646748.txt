<ABSTRACT>
A banjo-type coupling (1) for fluids, with a movable, hollow ring fitting (2) which accommodates a hollow screw (4) which has transverse bores (8) for the passage of the fluid from the ring fitting (2) into the hollow screw (4), and with sealing rings (9, 10) slipped onto the hollow screw (4) and lying on either side of the ring fitting (2). In order to connect the parts forming the banjo-type coupling (1) to one another in a preassembled and captive manner, the banjo-type coupling (1) is designed in such a way that the sealing ring (10) arranged on the threaded side of the hollow screw (4) is secured to the hollow screw (4) by axial upsetting.
