<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for positioning a magnetic servo head relative to a servo 
track on a traveling magnetic tape both make use of the observation that a given tape in 

a given tape drive unit exhibits transverse tape movements during operation which 
constitute a "signature" waveform for the coupled tape cartridge and drive unit. In the 

method and apparatus, the transverse movements of a traveling tape in a drive unit are 
monitored to obtain the aforementioned waveform which is characteristic of the transverse 

movements for that tape, and the waveform is stored. The positioning of the servo head 
is controlled relative to a servo track on the tape using a control signal generated 

according to any known track seek algorithm. The stored waveform is recalled and is 
superimposed on the control signal, thereby significantly increasing the accuracy of the 

positioning of the servo head, which in turn increases the accuracy of positioning of the 
write/read head.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a method and apparatus for improving the
accuracy of a conventional tape servo track seek algorithm, of the type used to position
a write/read head relative to a magnetic tape on which data and servo tracks are present
in a high density format.It is well known that imperfections in the rotating parts of a tape cartridge, such as
the capstan wheel and the rotor of the motor, cause characteristic frequencies which can
be observed in the tape transversal movements. At a given tape speed and a given
length of tape wound on the cartridge hubs, each rotating part has its own characteristic
frequency. This causes both longitudinal and transversal vibrations of the tape. These
dynamic transversal tape movements have heretofore been characterized in the frequency
domain with the aid of spectrum analyzers or by taking the Fast Fourier Transform of
time-domain waveforms captured on digital storage oscilloscopes. It is also well known
that certain abrupt transversal displacements of the tapes position in the tape guides can
take place. This last type of tape displacement is not directly caused by or related to the
characteristic frequencies of the rotating parts. This is an essential point of observation
for the invention. However, it is not unreasonable to believe that cartridge vibration or
external forces (e.g., gravity forces on the heavy tape hubs or external mechanical noise)
can trigger these abrupt displacements. The abrupt changes can take place simply
because there is room for them to occur. Due to mechanical tolerances of tape guides
and tape widths, the tape can not be kept in an absolute position with respect to one side 
of the tape guide. The worst-case "gap" between the widest guide and the narrowest
tape for the quarter-inch cartridges in use today is 46 Âµm. If an abrupt, change take
place randomly, the tape will still be subject to exactly the same vibrations stemming from
the rotating parts.For tapes with data and servo tracks thereon in a high density format, it is critical
to be able to accurately position the write/read head relative to a selected track. This is
accomplished using a servo head and track seek algorithm, of which many are known.
All such algorithms depend for their accuracy on the tape itself being located, and
remaining, at an "expected" position in a direction perpendicular (transverse) to the
direction of tape travel. The aforementioned transverse tape movements thus degrade,
or limit, the accuracy of known track seek algorithms since the
