<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an emulsifying
or emulsified epoxy resin composition, a curable
composition and processes for preparing thereof.Solvents have been employed to solve or dilute
epoxy resins in the prior art. It is, however, well
known that the regulation on the use of solvents has
recently become severer owing to the danger of fire
due to the use of solvents, the environmental problems
resulting from air pollution with solvents, the
influences of solvents on the human body, the increase
in the cost of solvents and so on.A coating process using an aqueous epoxy resin
has been paid attention to solve the above problems.
However, since epoxy resin emulsions, that is, aqueous
epoxy resins, of the prior art contain an unreactive
emulsifier in order to secure its emulsion stability,
coating films formed with the epoxy resin emulsions
are inferior to those formed with epoxy resins as such
or solutions thereof in solvents with respect to their 
properties such as resistances to water and chemicals
and film strength. On the other hand, in the case
that an emulsifier is selected so as to be able to
maintain the properties of coating film, it is
difficult to emulsify an epoxy resin in the
preparation of an epoxy resin emulsion.U.S. Patent No. 4608406 (published on August 26,
1986; CELANESE CORP. and INTEREZ INC.) discloses a
self-emulsification type epoxy resin prepared by
modifying an epoxy resin. However, this epoxy resin
has problems that the resin is poorly emulsifiable,
that the film formed by curing the resin exhibits poor
film strength and that the resin cures slowly.Further, U.S. Patent No. 4446256 (published on
May 1, 1984; CELANESE CORP. and INTEREZ INC.)
discloses a process for preparing a dispersant or an
emulsifier for preparing aqueous epoxy resins which
comprises reacting an aromatic, aromatic-originating
or alicyclic diol with a diisocyanate and a long-chain
aliphatic polyether glycol monoether, and U.S. Patent
No. 4987163 (published on January 22, 1991; HOECHST
AG) describes an aqueous disperse system such as an
emulsion or a suspension comprising an epoxy resin
prepared by dispersing or emulsifying a specific
self-emulsification epoxy resin in water or a mixture 
of water with, if necessary, an organic solvent and/or
additive. However, the preparations of these disperse
or emulsion systems were not always easy in their
dispersing or emulsifying step.The present invention has been made under these
circumstances. Namely, the present invention provides
an emulsifying epoxy resin
