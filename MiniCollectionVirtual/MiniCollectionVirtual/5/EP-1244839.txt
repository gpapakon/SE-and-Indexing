<ABSTRACT>
Arrangement for washing and dewatering of a fibre pulp suspension, which arrangement comprises two hollow, circular-cylindrical screen members (1), which screen members comprise evacuation chambers arranged inside the said screen members for leading off liquid. The screen members rotate counter to each other to form a nip (2), at least one of the said screen members (1) being arranged in a trough (7, 8) which partially encloses the jacket (3) of the screen member and which, in the direction of rotation of the screen member, converges towards the jacket of the screen member. The invention concerns a sealing arrangement 5 for a pulp headbox which distributes the pulp onto the jacket surface of the screen members. By forming a progressively decreasing gap B-A at the pulp headbox (4) counter to the rotation of the screen member, a simple self-sealing of the pulp suspension can be obtained which allows fibre residues to be returned to the dewatering zone. No wear between screen members and seal occurs with the invention.

<DESCRIPTION>
SEALING ARRANGEMENT FOR A PULP DEWATERING ARRANGEMENTThe present invention relates to a sealing arrangement according to the preamble of Claim 1.PRIOR ARTIn production of paper pulp from cellulose-containing fibre material, it is necessary to wash and dewater the paper pulp at several stages in the process. A previously known and commonly used arrangement for washing and dewatering of paper pulp, called a wash press, is described in SE-C-380, 300, SE-C-501, 710, US 5,488,900 and SE-C-504, 011. The arrangements disclosed in these documents comprise two cylindrical rotatable screen members arranged in an essentially convergent trough. Other examples of known arrangements are disclosed in US 4,543,161 and in US 5,667,642, the last-mentioned representing an arrangement in which the screen members rotate in the opposite direction to the usual one, i.e. the right screen member rotates counter-clockwise and the left screen member rotates clockwise, as viewed from the side.A problem encountered in washing and dewatering with wash presses of the abovementioned type is that fibre residues can remain on the drum after the washed and dewatered fibre mat has been removed. To flush these fibre residues away and to clean the holes in the screen members, spray pipes are used, for example those shown in US 4,861,433, where the spray pipes flush the exposed surface of the cylindrical rotatable screen members after the washed and dewatered fibre mat has been scraped off by a doctor blade. In wash presses with 180 degree coverage of the pulp web, the flushing takes place on the downwardly moving part of the drum, which means that the spray water and flushed-off fibre residues can run off. This has functioned satisfactorily, and repeated shutdowns for cleaning are 

not required. These spray pipes have shortcomings in their flushing capacity in high-power wash presses with longer dewatering paths of 270 degrees coverage, where pulp for dewatering is applied at the highest point of the drum and dewatered pulp is removed at the press nip between two drums. In such constructions, the spray water and the flushed-off fibre residues cannot run off along the drum naturally, since this flow would run back down towards the dewatered pulp. This means that fibre residues are continuously accumulated on the surface of the screen members against the pulp headbox until the wash press is buried.This accumulation of fibre residues means that the wash press has to be cleaned at regular intervals.

PATENT CLAIMS
1. Arrangement for washing and dewatering of a fibre pulp suspension, which arrangement comprises two circular-cylindrical screen members (1) arranged to rotate counter to each other to form a nip (2), at least one of the said screen members being hollow to permit evacuation of liquid radially inwards into the screen member, at least the hollow screen member (1) being arranged in a trough (7, 8) which partially encloses the jacket (3) of the screen member and which, in the direction of rotation of the screen member, converges towards the jacket of the screen member, and in which at least one pulp headbox (4) is arranged on the trough-provided screen member (1) for introducing pulp between the jacket (3) of the screen member and its trough (7, 8) in order to form a fibre pulp web on the screen member, c h a r a c t e r i z e d i n that the pulp headbox comprises a sealing arrangement (5) arranged between the pulp headbox and the screen member, this seal comprising a sealing surface with a progressively decreasing gap between the pulp headbox and the screen member in the direction counter to the rotation of the screen member, the gap at an inner edge (5c) of the pulp headbox corresponding to a first dimension B, and the gap at the outer edge (5b) of the pulp headbox corresponding to a second dimension A, and in that the gap has a circumferential extent over the screen member exceeding the dimension B by at least 2 times.
2. Arrangement according to Claim 1, c h a r a c t e r i z e d i n that the sealing arrangement is made of a thin-walled element which has a circumferential extent in the range of 2 to 20 times the dimension B.
3. Arrangement according to Claim 1 or 2, 


c h a r a c t e r i z e d i n that the dimension A corresponds to 10 - 90% of the dimension B, preferably less than 50% of the dimension B.
4. Arrangement according to any of the preceding claims, c h a r a c t e r i z e d i n that the dimension A corresponds to a gap of the order of magnitude of 5 - 10 millimetres for feeding pulp concentrations in the region of 10 - 12%.
5. Arrangement according to any of the preceding claims, c h a r a c t e r i z e d i n that the sealing arrangement is made of a thin-walled element in which the gap distance A is adjustable by means of an adjusting arrangement 50 for adapting the gap to the prevailing pulp concentrations and pressure of the pulp in the headbox.
6. Arrangement according to any of the preceding claims, c h a r a c t e r i z e d i n that the outer edge 5b of the sealing arrangement 5 is provided with an elastic sealing strip which is securely mounted on the outer edge 5b and bridges the gap A in such a way that the free end of the sealing strip bears against the surface of the screen member.
