<ABSTRACT>
An electromagnetic release device (10) for an electrical switching device, especially for a line protective circuit breaker or a motor protective circuit breaker has a magnet coil (15) which surrounds a magnet armature (18) and a magnet core (14). The magnet core is fastened on a web (12) of a magnet yoke (11) to whose outside a stationary contact piece (13) is also fitted. The magnet coil (15) is formed by a copper foil whose inner turn (16) is mechanically firmly and electrically conductively connected to the magnet core (14). The turns which are adjacent to the inner turn (16) are electrically insulated from one another, and a conductor (21) is connected to the outer turn (20). If the copper foil is a bare copper foil having an insulating coating on one side, then the bare side of each turn points towards the magnet core (14) or magnet armature (18). The magnet core and the magnet armature (14, 18; 31, 30) can have a circular or rectangular cross-section.
