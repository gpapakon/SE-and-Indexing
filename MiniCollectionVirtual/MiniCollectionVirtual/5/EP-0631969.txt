<ABSTRACT>
In the present invention, a rotating elevator 
motor (6) provided with a traction 

sheave (18) is placed in the counterweight 
(26) of an elevator suspended with 

ropes (2). A gear system is not necessarily 
needed because, according to the 

invention, the structure and placement of 
the motor allow the use of a motor having 

a large diameter and a high torque. As 
the length of the motor still remains 

small, the motor/counterweight of the 
invention can be accommodated in the 

space normally reserved for a counterweight 
in the elevator shaft. The motor 

shaft lies in the counterweight (26) 
substantially midway between the guide 

rails (8) and the number (a,b) of ropes 
is equal on both sides of the plane (24) 

going through the centre lines of the 
guide rails.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the counterweight of a
rope-suspended elevator moving along guide rails and to an
elevator drive machinery/motor placed in the counterweight,
said motor comprising a traction sheave, a bearing, an
element supporting the bearing, a shaft, a stator provided
with a winding, and a rotating rotor.Traditionally, an elevator machinery consists of a hoisting
motor which, via a gear, drives the traction sheaves around
which the hoisting ropes of the elevator are passed. The
hoisting motor, elevator gear and traction sheaves are
generally placed in a machine room above the elevator shaft.
They can also be placed beside or below the elevator shaft.
Another known solution is to place the elevator machinery in
the counterweight of the elevator. Previously known is also
the use of a linear motor as the hoisting machine of an
elevator and its placement in the counterweight.Conventional elevator motors, e.g. cage induction, slip ring
or d.c. motors, have the advantage that they are simple and
that their characteristics and the associated technology
have been developed during several decades and have reached
a reliable level. In addition, they are advantageous in
respect of price. A system with a traditional elevator
machinery placed in the counterweight is presented e.g. in
publication US 3101130. A drawback with the placement of the
elevator motor in this solution is that it requires a large
cross-sectional area of the elvator shaft.Using a linear motor as the hoisting motor of an elevator
involves problems beacause either the primary part or the
secondary part of the motor has to be as long as the shaft.
Therefore, linear motors are expensive to use as elevator
motors. A linear motor for an elevator, placed in the counterweight,
is presented e.g. in publication US 5062501. However,
a linear motor placed in the counterweight has certain 
advantages, e.g. that no machine room is needed and that the
motor requires but a relatively small cross-sectional area
of the counterweight.The motor of an elevator may also be of the external-rotor
type, in which the traction sheave is joined directly to the
rotor. Such a structure is presented e.g. in publication JP
5232870. The motor is gearless. The problem with this structure
is that, to achieve a sufficient torque, the length and
diameter of the motor have to be increased. In the structure
presented in US 4771197, the length of the motor is further
increased by the brake, which is placed alongside of the
rope grooves. Moreover, the blocks
