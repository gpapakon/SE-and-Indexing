<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to passive 
structures useful for vibration damping and more 
specifically to the use of superabsorbent polymer/water 
gels for acoustic or other vibration damping. All substances in which molecules are sufficiently 
close to collide with one another have viscosity and 
there will be frictional losses when these substances 
are vibrated by any means, including sound waves. The 
common terminology is damping coefficient or loss 
factor. Fibrous materials make good sound absorbers. 
Glass fiber, mineral or rock wool and felts are all 
widely employed, in ceiling tiles, for example. The 
amount of absorption depends on the thickness, number 
of fibers per unit volume and the density of the 
product. Moreover, the transmission loss in dB of a single-leaf 
finite wall is given by the well-known mass law:

TLm = 20 log mf - 48 dB 


 
where m is the mass of the wall in kilograms per square 
meter and f is the frequency. Various methods are 
employed to achieve acoustic damping properties in 
multi-layer walls including metal resilient channels 
and Thermafiber® mineral-fiber sound attenuation fire 
blankets.  For polymer materials, damping of energy is 
typically thought of as a consequence of 
viscoelasticity, that is, the behavior associated with 
viscous liquids and elastomeric solids. In viscous 
liquids the rate of deformation is proportional to the 
applied stress while in an elastomeric solid, 
deformation is proportional to the applied stress. 
Work is converted to heat by viscous liquids and is 
stored as potential energy by elastomeric solids. The 
interaction of viscoelastic materials with an applied 
sinusoidal strain is commonly described in terms of a 
storage modulus G' which is in-phase with the applied 
strain and a loss modulus G'' which is 90° out of phase. 
The loss factor or damping term, tan δ, is described 
as:

tan δ = G''/G' 


 
which is generally regarded as a measure of damping 
ability inherent in a material. The consensus is that 
to be an effective damping material for a constrained 
layer composite, a polymer should have a loss factor 
(tan δ) of at least about 0.05 - 0.1. Generally 
speaking, polymers become usable for sound damping in 
the region of their Tg values. A discussion of sound 
control and sound-damping technology is found in 
International Encyclopedia of Composites, Volume 5, pp. 
178-218, VCH (New York 1991). Superabsorbent polymer gels may have unexplored 
potential for vibration damping; their use as additives 
to rubber
