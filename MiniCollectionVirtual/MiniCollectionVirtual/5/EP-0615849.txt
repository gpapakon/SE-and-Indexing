sheets (69) may be attached in a detachable manner; a 

sheet feed table (50) which is vertically movable within 
the sheet feed unit (10) and which carries a large number 

of cut sheets (68); a plurality of detectors (110,111,112) 
for detec
ting the positions of the sheet feed unit (10), 
the sheet feed table (50) and the cut sheets (68,69) 

relative to the sheet feed position (P2); a sheet overload 
detector (100d), in effect when detection signals are 

received from the detectors (110,111,112) with the sheet 
feed table (50) set to feed the cut sheets (68), for 

outputting a detection signal (S3) indicating an overload 
of the cut sheets (68) on the sheet feed table (50), the 

overload being detected by the detectors with respect to 
the relative position between the sheet feed unit (10) and 

the sheet feed table (50) with reference to the sheet feed 
position (P2); and a mode controller (100f) for controlling 

the vertical movement of the sheet feed unit (10) and the

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cut sheet feeder 
for use with the image forming apparatus such as a copier 
or a printer, the feeder feeding the apparatus with cut 
sheets of recording paper. The image forming apparatus is most often used to 
record image on a large number of cut sheets of the same 
size which are fed continuously. But occasionally, it is 
desired to interrupt the ongoing process of image 
printing involving many cut sheets so as to insert image 
printing of a different kind typically on a smaller 
number of sheets. Some of the conventional cut sheet 
feeders for use with the image forming apparatus have 
mechanisms that meet the requirements for the on-demand 
inserted printing. Such conventional cut sheet feeders have a plurality 
of sheet feed mechanisms positioned near the sheet feed 
table or sheet cassette assembly, each mechanism 
comprising its dedicated pick-up rollers, guide plates 
and other related parts. When the operator selects a  
 
desired sheet type, the corresponding sheet feed 
mechanism is activated. The activated mechanism picks up 
cut sheets one by one from the applicable sheet feed 
table or from the corresponding sheet cassette and feeds 
them into position inside the image forming apparatus. The conventional cut sheet feeder of the above-mentioned 
type has as many sheet feed mechanisms as the 
number of the sheet feed tables or the sheet cassettes 
that are mounted in advance of feed operation. The cut 
sheet feeder also has a plurality of sheet transport 
routes for guiding cut sheets from the multiple storage 
locations via rollers to a common feed position. These 
features combine to make the cut sheet feeder bulky, 
complex, and thus prone to feed-related troubles. Furnishing the multiple sheet feed tables entails 
the drawback of a reduced amount of cut sheets that may 
be placed on each table. Where the image forming 
apparatus is a high-speed type, the limited quantities of 
cut sheets stacked on the sheet feed tables make it 
necessary for the operator frequently to replenish cut 
sheets. On the other hand, there exist cut sheet feeders 
having only one sheet feed table that carries a large 
number of cut sheets. With the signal table structure, 
the sheet feed table moves vertically to keep feeding the 
many cut sheets it carries into the sheet feed mechanism. 
This type of cut sheet feeder has difficultly in allowing 
the operator to switch cut sheets halfway or to interrupt  
 
the ongoing bulk printing to effect on-demand inserted 
printing on

apparatus, comprising: 


a sheet feed mechanism (3) for picking up stacked cut 
sheets (68,69) one at a time from a single sheet feed position (P2) 

and for feeding each sheet to an image recording portion; 
a sheet feed unit (10) which is vertically movable 
relative to said sheet feed mechanism (3) and to which a 

cassette (K) containing cut sheets (69) may be attached in a 
detachable manner; 
a sheet feed table (50) which is vertically movable 
within said sheet feed unit (10) and which carries a large 

number of cut sheets (68); 
a plurality of detection means (110-112) for detecting the 
positions of said sheet feed unit (10), said sheet feed table (50) 

and the cut sheets (68,69) relative to said sheet feed position (P2); 
sheet overload detection means (100d), in effect when

for outputting a detection signal (S3) indicating an overload 

of the cut sheets (68) on said sheet feed table (50), the overload 
being detected by said detection means (110-112) with respect to

mechanism and the excess portion of said cut sheets is 
removed.

control means lowers at least said sheet feed table by a 
predetermined amount in accordance with the detection

the inability of said sheet feed unit to reach said upper 
limit position because of an insufficient gap between the 

cut sheets and said sheet feed position compared with the 
gap between said sheet feed unit and said upper limit 

position, and output said detection signal indicating
