Scaffolding 

for working within hollow elements (1) large dimensions 

such as tanks, quarries, etc, 
of the type constituted by a carrying structure which 
is intended to rest on ground and which is equipped with 

modular platforms (6) mounted at variable heights in 
cantilever fashion on the periphery of said structure and 

with access means (7) to said platforms, 
 
characterized in that 


a) said carrying structure is formed of two legs (3) 
connected to each other by at least two cross members 

(4, 5) forming floorings, situated at different levels 
and rigidifying the assembly, 
b) the modular platforms (6) are mounted on the external 
face of said legs (3) and 
c) the access means (7) to said platforms are disposed 
within, or at the vicinity of the legs (3) 
 
and in that
 
   d) the legs of the carrying structure are each equipped 

of at least two lines of post feet, preferably three 
(9a, 9b, 9c), disposed parallel to the longitudinal 

axis of the scaffolding, said post feet being 
adjustable in height so as to pemit the temporary 

raising of at least one line of post feet per leg. 
Scaffolding according to claim 1,
 
characterized in that the modular platforms (6) present 

at their end opposite to the secured to the leg (3) a 
telescopic portion (8). 
Scaffolding according to claim 2,
 
characterized in that said telescopic portion (8) is 

formed by at least two telescopic arms supporting a 
removable flooring and whose ends are interconnected by a  

 
connection member (15) on which the operator acts to vary 

the length of said arms. 
Scaffolding according to claim 3,
 
characterized in that the connection member (15) 

constitutes also a plinth preventing any untimely falling 
of objects. 
Scaffolding according to one of claims 2 to 4,
 
characterized in that said arms are provided with 

indexing means which permet locking the arms into 
predetermined lengths. 
Scaffolding according to one of claims 1 to 5,
 
characterized in that the constituent elements of 

scaffolding are realized such that their disassociation 
permits obtaining elements of very small size. 
Use of the scaffolding according to one of claims 1 to 
6 for the installation of insulations against the walls 

of the tank of a methane tanker.
