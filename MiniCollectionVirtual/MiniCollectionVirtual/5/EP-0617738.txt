<ABSTRACT>
The method for tanning of hides by means of tanning agents in a tanning bath is characterized by the fact that the bath besides the hides comprises an oxidoreductase, and as tanning agent an aromatic compound and possibly other compounds which are able to react with the hides and/or the aromatic compound, and that an oxidation agent is introduced into the equilibrated tanning bath. In this manner it is possible to increase the degree of fixation considerably in comparison to the prior art methods of this kind.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD FOR TANNING OF HIDES BY MEANS OF TANNING AGENTSThe invention comprises a method for tanning of hides by means of tanning agents.The most used tanning agents are chrome based, but chrome based tanning agents are considered environmentally unfriendly, and thus, alternative tanning agents, which are environmentally friendly, are always welcome.In the tanning art it is intended to perform a fixation of tanning agents within the collagen matrix, both due to the fact that the quality of the leather will be better with increasing degree of fixation, and also because the pollution will be reduced with increasing degree of fixation and uptake of tanning agents. However, the prior art methods for tanning of hides by means of tanning agents are open to improvement in regard to degree of fixation.Thus, the purpose of the invention is the provision of a method for tanning of hides by means of tanning agents, in relation to which the degree of fixation and uptake of tanning agents is increased considerably in comparison to the prior art methods of this kind.Now, surprisingly it has been found according to the invention that it is possible to increase the degree of fixation considerably in comparison to the prior art methods of this kind, if the tanning is supported by an enzyme belonging to a specific enzyme category in the tanning bath, and if specific primary and secondary substrates for this enzyme are added sequentially.Thus, the method according to the invention for tanning of hides by means of tanning agents in a tanning bath is characterized by the fact that the bath besides the hides comprises an oxidoreductase, and as tanning agent an aromatic compound and possibly other compounds which are able to react with the hides and/or the aromatic compound, and that an oxidation agent is introduced into the equilibrated tanning bath.A further advantage related to the invention is the fact that the use of toxic coagents (like formaldehyde) used to crosslink organic tanning agents is avoided. Furthermore the invention is environmentally friendly, as cheap synthetic 

 tanning agents can be used instead of the conventionally used tanning agents produced by extraction of wood from tropic forests.US 3,212,996 describes a process for enzymatic modification of organic tanning agents. This prior art process is concerned with the same enzymes and the 5 same organic tanning agents as in relation to the method according to the invention, but the modified tanning agents in the prior art method are produced separately
