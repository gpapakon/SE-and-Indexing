<ABSTRACT>
The valve consists of a valve housing (1) which is screwed into the lid (2) of the cooker and has a vertical longitudinal bore hole (5) to receive a piston. When the vapour pressure rises in the interior of the cooker, the piston (6) is displaced upwards in order to give a successive visual display of the internal pressure in the cooker and to expose at least two transverse gaps (20, 21), arranged one above the other, to relieve the pressure in the valve housing. The visual display consists in signal rings (17, 18), which are arranged on the upper part of the piston rod (7), becoming visible. The valve has a recess (16) which connects the interior of the cooker to the outside air and is exposed by the piston (6) in a lowest position of the latter. In the non-pressurised state, the piston (6) is held automatically in the lowest position by the force of gravity. Under pressure, the piston (6) is moved into the lowest position by manual pressing-down of a part of the piston rod (7) which projects out of the housing (1). When the vapour begins to develop, the piston (6) is raised along a path (w) counter to the force of gravity until it is seated tightly in the longitudinal bore hole (5), seals the recess (16) and begins to stress a previously unstressed spring (15).   The valve which is constructed simply of few individual parts and can easily be dismantled combines the following functions: ventilation in the state of rest, visual and acoustic display of the vapour pressure, safety pressure release under excess pressure, vapour release prior to opening the cooker.
