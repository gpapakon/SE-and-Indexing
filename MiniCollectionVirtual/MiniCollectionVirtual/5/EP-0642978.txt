<ABSTRACT>
The standardized drum with a removable cover is provided with a reduced diameter compared to conventional drums of this type for the purpose of accommodating the drums in an ISO container. The drums which are circular in cross-section have a drum casing 1 and a bottom 3 which is connected thereto by means of a folded seam connection, whereas the upper edge of the drum casing 1 has an outer roller edge 4 onto which a lid 5 is fitted with a clamping ring 6 and lever closure. Arranged in the drum casing 1 are rolled and reinforcing beads 2, 2' which are curved outwards. One section 7 of the drum casing 1 tapers towards the lid 5 in the manner of a truncated cone in such a way that the outside diameter at the clamping ring 6, including the lever closure, is reduced to the extent that four drums can be accommodated on the narrow side of the ISO container and ten drums can be accommodated over its length.
