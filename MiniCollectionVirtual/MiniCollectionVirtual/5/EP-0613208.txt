<ABSTRACT>
2.1 The invention is based on the object of creating a rotatable curtain antenna system which prevents metallic parts of the curtain touching the supporting framework even when the antenna curtain is subject to wind loads, and at the same time keeps the curtain separation constant. 2.2 This object is achieved according to the invention in that the supporting means for bracing of the lower cantilever arms (5) are arranged on the sides outside the clamping surfaces of the dipole curtains (17, 18) and the reflector curtains (19), in that the mounting points for the dipole curtains (17, 18) and for the reflector curtains (19) are arranged in a vertical plane (30-30) on the tower column (1), said vertical plane (30-30) being at right angles to the curtain planes. 2.3 The invention is used in the case of a rotatable curtain antenna system, preferably for emitting high transmission power in the short waveband, having at least one dipole curtain and at least one reflector curtain and having a central tower column which can rotate about its longitudinal axis, has mounting points for the curtains and is provided closely above the ground and at its upper part with in each case two opposite cantilever arms which are braced by supporting means and are used for clamping the dipole curtains and reflector curtains.

Rotatable curtain antenna system, preferably for radiation of high transmission
power in the shortwave range, with at least one dipole curtain and at least one reflector

curtain and with a central tower shaft, which is rotatable about its longitudinal axis and has
fastening points for the reflector curtain and which is provided closely above the ground

and in its upper part in each instance with two oppositely disposed cantilever arms, which
are stayed by support means, serve for the mo
unting of the dipole and reflector curtains,
are each fastened by one end thereof at the tower shaft, are arranged below and above

the curtains and have support means arranged outside the mounting areas of the dipole
and reflection curtains, characterised thereby that fastening means, which are mounted at

the tower shaft (1), for a fastening of the dipole curtains (17, 18) and the reflector curtains
(19) at a spacing from the tower shaft are arranged in a vertical plane (30-30), which

extends perpendicularly to the curtain planes.
Rotatable curtain antenna system according to claim 1, characterised thereby that
the plane (30-30) is the plane of symmetry of the antenna system.
Rotatable curtain antenna system, preferably for radiation of high transmission
power in the shortwave range, with at least one dipole curtain and at least one reflector

curtain and with a central tower shaft, which is rotatable about its longitudinal axis and has
fastening points for the reflector curtain and which is provided closely above the ground

and in its upper part in each instance with two oppositely disposed cantilever arms, which
are stayed by support means, serve for the mounting of the dipole and reflector curtains,

are each fastened by one end thereof at the tower shaft, are arranged below and above
the curtains and have support means arranged outside the mounting areas of the dipole

and reflection curtains, characterised thereby that fastening means, which are mounted at
the tower shaft (1), for a fastening of the dipole curtains (17, 18) and the reflector curtains

(19) at a spacing from the tower shaft are arranged in two vertical planes (30-30), which
extend perpendicularly to the curtain planes and are disposed on both sides of the plane of

symmetry parallelly to and at a spacing from one another.
Rotatable curtain antenna system according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised
thereby that the two upper cantilever arms (5) are fastened at the lower shaft (1) directly

above the height which the reflector curtains (19) must have to fulfill their function. 
Rotatable curtain antenna system according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised
thereby that the upper cantilever arms (5) are stayed by upper cantilever arm support

cables (6) to extend obliquely upwardly from the tower shaft (1), that the tower shaft (1)
projects by its tower shaft tip (31) in height above the free ends of the upper cantilever

arms (5) and that the upper cantilever arm support cables (6) are led to the tower shaft tip
(31).
