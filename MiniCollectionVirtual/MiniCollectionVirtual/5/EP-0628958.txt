<ABSTRACT>
An optical record carrier having a substrate (5), an entrance face (7) and a 
recording layer (8) is described. The entrance face is provided with an anti-reflection 

relief structure in the form of a circular or spiral groove. Due to this structure the 
energy of the incident radiation beam (6) is used relatively efficiently for writing into 

the recording layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an optical record carrier for writing and/or
reading information by means of a radiation beam, which record carrier comprises a
transparent substrate having an entrance face for the radiation beam and an opposite
face, and a recording layer arranged on said opposite face.Many known optical record carriers such as an audio disc known as the
Compact Disc (CD), a data disc known as Compact Disc Read Only Memory (CD-ROM)
and Laser Vision (LV) are provided with information by the manufacturer and
can only be read by the user. A record carrier which is inscribable in a special
write/read device and readable with the same read device as the one intended for
reading the above-mentioned, non-inscribable record carriers is applicable in a great
many places. Applications are distribution of information in the form of audio or digital
data to a small number of clients, for which the manufacture of a normal CD or CD-ROM
is too expensive. However, for readability, the inscribed record carrier should
then satisfy the same standard requirements as the non-inscribable record carrier. This
involves an initial reflection of the recording layer of 70% or more and a contrast of
60%. The initial reflection is the reflection of a non-inscribed part of the record carrier,
while the contrast is the difference in reflection of the non-inscribed parts and the
inscribed parts, divided by the initial reflection. It is found to be difficult to
manufacture an inscribable record carrier which meets these requirements. This is
particularly the case if use is to be made of materials referred to as phase-change
materials for the recording layer. The crystalline or amorphous phase of these materials
changes by irradiation with a laser beam from one into the other, resulting in a change
of the coefficient of reflection of the material. When writing in a record carrier having
an initial reflection of 70%, at most 30% of the radiation will be absorbed in the layer.
The reflection is due to reflection on the entrance face of the record carrier and
reflection on the recording layer. It has turned out to be difficult to couple the required
amount of energy for writing into the layer when using present-day diode lasers as are
commonly employed in read/write devices. A record carrier of the type given in the opening paragraph and providing
a possible solution to the above problem is described in the non-prepublished European
Patent Application EP-A-0 549 024. The entrance surface of this record
carrier is provided with an
