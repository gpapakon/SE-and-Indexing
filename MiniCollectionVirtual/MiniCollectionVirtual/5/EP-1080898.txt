<ABSTRACT>
In a thermal ink jet print head, individually-controlled heating elements (309) are
separated into groups (602, 615) of heating elements. Redundant control lines for the

separate groups of heating elements increase the print head's reliability by reducing the
likelihood that a print head will be completely disabled by an electrical fault on the control

lines that in prior art devices extended to all of the heating elements.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to inkjet printing devices. In particular, the invention relates to an inkjet print head for thermal inkjet printing devices that incorporates multiple address bus demultiplexing circuitry for driving the drop ejector heater resistors.The art of inkjet printing technology is relatively well developed. Commercial products such as computer printers, graphics plotters, copiers, and facsimile machines successfully employ inkjet technology for producing hard copy printed output. The basics of the technology have been disclosed in various articles in the Hewlett-Packard Journal, Vol. 36, No. 5 (May 1985), Vol. 39, No. 4 (August 1988), Vol. 39, No. 5 (October 1988), Vol. 43, No. 4 (August 1992), Vol. 43, No. 6 (December 1992) and Vol. 45, No. 1 (February 1994) editions. Inkjet devices have also been described by W.J. Lloyd and H.T. Taub in Output Hardcopy Devices (R.C. Durbeck and S. Sherr, ed., Academic Press, San Diego,1988, chapter 13).A thermal inkjet printer for inkjet printing typically includes one or more translationally reciprocating print cartridges in which small drops of ink. are ejected by thermal energy from a drop generator, towards a medium upon which it is desired to place alphanumeric characters, graphics, or images. Such cartridges typically include a print head having an orifice member or plate that has a plurality of small nozzles through which the ink drops are ejected. Beneath the nozzles are ink firing chambers, which are enclosures in which ink resides prior to ejection through a nozzle. Ink is supplied to the ink firing chambers through ink channels that are in fluid communication with an ink reservoir, which may be contained in a reservoir portion of the print cartridge or in a separate ink container spaced apart from the print head.Ink drop ejection through a nozzle employed in a thermal inkjet printer is accomplished by quickly heating the volume of ink residing within the ink firing chamber with a selectively energizing electrical pulse to a heater resistor ink ejector positioned in the ink firing chamber. At the commencement of the heat energy output from the heater resistor, an ink vapor bubble nucleates at sites on the surface of the heater resistor or its protective layers. The rapid expansion of the ink vapor bubble forces the liquid ink through the nozzle. Once the electrical pulse ends and an ink drop is ejected, the ink firing chamber refills with ink from the ink channel and ink reservoir.Thermal inkjet ink can be corrosive.
