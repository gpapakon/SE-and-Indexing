<ABSTRACT>
A homokinetic coupling for rotary parts allows an angular and/or radial offset between the parts. The coupling has first and second halves (10, 12) and linked thereto by connecting rod arrangements. Each intermediate member (14, 16) is linked to the first coupling half (10) by a first pair of diametrally opposed connecting rods (86, 90) joined to journals (68, 70) so as to move in all directions, and is linked to the second coupling half (12) by a second pair of rods (8, 92) joined to the journals (68, 70) so as to move in all directions. The journal of one connecting rod of one pair is aligned with the journal of one connecting rod of the other pair. Both intermediate members (14, 16) cross each other and are centered with respect to each other by a centering ball (58). A traction spring acts between both intermediate members (14, 16) pressing both intermediate members (14, 16) against the centering ball (58). For this purpose the centering ball (58) has a transverse bore (142). The traction spring extends through the transverse bore (142) and is linked on one side with one intermediate member and on the opposite side with the other intermediate member (14, 16). The connecting rods (86, 88, 90, 92) are joined to the journals (68, 70) by metallic rocker bearings (84).
