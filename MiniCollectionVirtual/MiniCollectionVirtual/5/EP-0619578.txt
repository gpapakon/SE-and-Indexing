<ABSTRACT>
In a magnetic tape moving mechanism of a magnetic 
recording and reproducing apparatus, a drum chassis (6) 

provided with a rotating drum (2) and plural guide rollers (7, 
9, 11, 12, 19) for winding a magnetic tape (4) of a cassette 

(3) around the rotating drum (2) is pivotally mounted on a 
cassette chassis (5) for holding the cassette (3), so that the 

drum chassis (6) rotates by about 90 degrees with respect to 
the cassette chassis (5). When the cassette (3) is loaded in 

the magnetic tape moving mechanism, the axis of the rotating 
drum (2) is substantially parallel to the axis of a tape reel 

(3A; 3B) of the cassette (3); and after the magnetic tape (4) 
is wound around the rotating drum (2), the drum chassis (6) is 

rotated by about 90 degrees, and the axis of the rotating drum 
(2) is tilted substantially perpendicularly with respect to the 

axis of the tape reel (3A; 3B).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a helical-scanning 
magnetic recording and reproducing apparatus for 
recording and reproducing by a rotary head on a magnetic 
tape wound around a drum. FIG.16 is a plan view of a relevant part of a 
helical-scanning magnetic recording and reproducing 
apparatus in the prior art. Referring to FIG.16, a 
cassette 103 of a magnetic cassette tape comprises a 
supply reel 102A and a take-up reel 102B, and a magnetic 
tape 104 is suspended between the supply reel 102A and the 
take-up reel 102B. The magnetic tape 104 is supplied from 
the supply reel 102A, is wound around the circumference of 
a drum 111 by about 270 degrees of central angle via some 
guide posts and is finally taken up by the take-up reel 
102B. A moving path of the magnetic tape 104 is formed by 
guide posts 105, 106 and 107, tilt guide posts 108 and 
109, guide posts 110, 112, 113 and 116 and a pinch roller 
117. The magnetic tape 104 is pinched between the pinch 
roller 117 and a capstan 118 rotating at a predetermined 
revolution speed, and is moved in the direction shown by 
an arrow J. An erasing head 114 and a stationary audio  
 
head 115 are arranged along the moving path so as to 
contact the magnetic tape 104. The drum 111 rotates in 
the direction shown by an arrow I, and a signal is 
recorded or reproduced on the magnetic tape 104 by a 
rotating head disposed in the drum 111. In the magnetic recording reproducing apparatus 
in the prior art shown in FIG.16, a depthwise length DL 
from a rear face 103A of the cassette 103 to the guide 
post 110 is a sum of a depth H of the cassette 103, a 
diameter D of the drum 111, a gap G1 between a side face 
of the guide post 110 and the side face of the drum 111 
and a gap G2 between a side face of the drum 111 and a 
front protrusion 103B of the cassette 103. In the magnetic recording and reproducing 
apparatus using such a cassette 103, the rear face 103A of 
the cassette 103 is arranged at the front face of the 
magnetic recording and reproducing apparatus, and the 
guide post 110 is placed at the most inner part. Therefore, 
the depth of the magnetic recording and reproducing 
apparatus can not be reduced less than the length DL. In 
general, the reduction of the depth is required in the 
magnetic and reproducing apparatus, and for this purposes 
the above-mentioned gaps G1 and G2 must be decreased as 
shorter as possible. However, since the distances G1 and 
G2 are relatively shorter than the length H or the 
diameter D, even if these distances are
