<ABSTRACT>
A console (1) for facilitating the correct assembly 
and spacing of the characters forming a vehicle number 

plate. The console comprising a working surface (A) 
provided with guide members (2) for locating the top 

corners of the reflective backing panel of a rear number 
plate, and guide members (3) for the lower corners of the 

reflective backing panel of a front number plate. Tiles 
carrying the characters to be pressure transferred to the 

panels being laid on the panels with spacers as 
necessary. A table (15) provides a reference index 

letter datum according to the number and type of the 
characters so that the start point and the end point of 

the line of characters may be accurately referenced to 
indices (11,12) and (13,14) in order to obtain correct 

layout. The indices (11,12) and (13,14) are carried on 
rulers (4) and (5) hinged to the surface (A) at (6) and 

(7) respectively. The rulers serve to retain the 
reflective backing panels and align the tiles during 

assembly. A storage rack (9) with pockets (10) for the 
character bearing tiles is part of the console unit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
assembling front and rear vehicle number plates and to an 
arrangement as well as a console or display frame 
apparatus for carrying out the method. Methods are known for the assembly of vehicle number 
plates comprising assembling in a predetermined manner 
the required characters consisting of letters and numbers 
with the characters spaced from one another in 
predetermined fashion by placing tiles of plastics 
material bearing the required characters onto a 
reflective panel of plastics material, transferring the 
characters to the surface of the reflective panel from 
the tiles and thereafter bonding the surface of the 
reflective panel to a support plate of transparent 
plastics material. One such method is disclosed in EP 
0102904 A1, and GB1564701A as example. To facilitate the assembly by the above method, 
which is usually carried out to a customer's order, a 
console or display frame may be employed with a work 
surface and guide members thereon to ensure correct  
 
centralisation and alignment, as well as holding the 
indicia in position. Such means are disclosed in GB 
2093622A, GB 2026750A and GB1564701A. The indicia, usually black, are carried on 
supporting "tiles" from which they may be transferred to 
the back plate by pressure once correctly positioned. 
The edges of adjacent tiles abut to provide a preset 
regular spacing. The known art has serious drawbacks where the 
spacing between tiles needs to be varied to take into 
account the letter used and the number of characters as 
well as the size of plate, such parameters being dictated 
by legislation. This invention overcomes the problems 
inherent in the known methods. The solution offered by this invention has quite 
wide applicability but may well be especially 
advantageous for a country such as France where it is 
necessary to comply with certain stringent regulations. 
From 1st January 1993, vehicle number plates issued in 
France must be reflective, white for the front and yellow 
or orange at the rear. Due to the French system of 
allocating registration numbers, the manufacture of 
vehicle number plates has to take place at the point of 
sale and the present invention is well able to cater for 
this. However, significant problems of size and spacing  
 
of characters had to be overcome:- 
a) the French registration consists of a group of 2, 3 
or 4 numbers, followed by 2 or 3 letters, followed 
by 2 numbers.  b) The front plate is smaller than the rear plate.  c) Although the

<CLAIMS>
A method of assembling a front and/or rear 
vehicle number plate comprising assembl
ing in a 
predetermined manner the required characters consisting 

of letters and numbers (22,23) with the characters spaced 
from one another in predetermined fashion by placing 

tiles (20,21) of plastics material bearing the required 
characters onto a reflective panel of plastics material, 

transferring the characters to the surface of the 
reflective panel from the tiles and thereafter bonding 

the surface of the reflective panel to a support plate of 
transparent plastics material, characterised by the 

spacing of the characters being determined by causing 
adjacent tiles (20,21) to be disposed side by side in an 

abutting relationship or, alternatively, the spacing of 
the characters is determined by causing adjacent tiles 

(20,21) to overlap by a predetermined amount preferably 
as determined by a mark, sign or line (24) on the tile 

whereby corresponding marks, signs or lines (24) of 
adjacent tiles (20,21) become superimposed, to locate the 

tiles in the required position. 
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the reflective panel is clamped to a support surface  

 
(A) whilst placing the tiles thereon and released from 

the support surface (A) when the characters have been 
transferred and bonded to the reflective panel and before 

bonding the surface of the reflective panel to a support 
plate of plastics material. 
An arrangement for carrying out the method of any 
preceding claim, characterised by a console or display 

frame (1) having guide means (2,3) for alignment and 
preferably also retaining at least one reflective panel 

in a required position on the console or frame (1) and 
calibrated guide (11,12,13,14) means to position tiles 

(20,21) bearing characters (22,23) at predetermined 
positions on the said reflective panel retained on the 

console or display frame (1) so as to enable the required 
assembly of characters (22,23) on the reflective panel to 

be made, the spacing of the characters being determined 
by causing adjacent tiles (20,21) to be disposed side by 

side in an abutting relationship or, alternatively, the 
spacing of the characters is determined by causing 

adjacent tiles (20,21) to overlap by a predetermined 
amount preferably as determined by a mark, sign or line
