A method for manufacturing a cart from 
synthetic material, in particular a cart for use in self-service 

stores, said cart having a first (1) and a second 
(2) side flank, each of which includes a foot segment 

(2,4) and a basket segment, both moulded in one single 
piece, said first and second side flank being mutually 

connected by means of coupling elements (25,26 ; 22,39), 
characterized in that, upon moulding the side flanks, at 

least the side contour of the basket segment as well as 
a first (12), respectively a second (13) flange, on the 

first respectively on the second side flank, are moulded 
in one single piece, said first and second flank being 

moulded such as to extend mutually in opposite directions 
when the cart is assembled, said first and second flanks 

being assembled by means of coupling elements which are 
attached to said flanges. 
A manufacturing method according to 
claim 1, characterized in that the side flanks are 

moulded at a predetermined dimension, a set of coupling 
elements being moulded for each side flank dimension, the 

different elements of said set having each a mutually 
different predetermined width. 
A manufacturing method according to 
claim 1 or 2, characterized in that at least one opening 

(8,9) is moulded in the basket segment of each side 
flank. 
A method according to claim 3, characterized 
in that two essentially triangular openings are 

provided in each side flank, said openings being separated 
by an arm (47) which extends diagonally in said flank 

from an upper forward portion towards a lower rearward 
portion of the cart. 
A manufacturing method according to 
claim 3 or 4, characterized in that a mesh (10,11) is 

applied in each of said openings.  
 
A manufacturing method according to any 
one of the claims 1 to 5, characterized in that at least 

one attachment point (5) for a handle (6) is moulded 
simultaneously with the moulding of said side flank. 
A manufacturing method according to any 
one of the claims 1 to 6, characterized in that a gate 

(40) provided with two bossages (27, 28) applied on both 
sides of a median line of the gate and situated on an 

extremity of this gate at the level of the bottom of the 
basket, is mounted on a rearward end of the cart. 
A manufacturing method according to 
claim 7, characterized in that a flap (29) provided with 

a projection (30) of a length corresponding to the 
distance between the bossages is mounted against the gate 

in such a manner that the bossages and the projection 
form a hinge. 
A manufacturing method according to any 
one of the claims 1 to 8, characterized in that a guide 

rail (31) is moulded onto each side flank at a location 
situated underneath the bottom of the basket. 
A manufacturing method according to 
claim 9, characterized in that after having assembled the 

first and the second side flanks, a pull-out tablet (32) 
is mounted between the guide rails. 
A manufacturing method according to 
any one of the claims 1 to 10, characterized in that 

another opening (24) is applied in the coupling element 
(23) for mutually connecting the first and the second 

side flanks on their forward portion, an extraction 
tongue (36) being mounted on a transverse edge of said 

opening. 
A manufacturing method according to 
claim 11, characterized in that a frame (33) is applied 

to at least a portion of the circumference of the other 
opening upon moulding the coupling element.  

 
A manufacturing method according to 
any one of the claims 1 to 12, characterized in that the 

elements of the cart are made of SMC.
