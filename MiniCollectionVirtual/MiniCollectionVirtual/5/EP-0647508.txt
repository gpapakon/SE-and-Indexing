<ABSTRACT>
Workstation for fitting a seat (1) inside the passenger compartment of a vehicle (2), the seat including a lower structure (1a) for fastening to the body of the vehicle, the workstation including a standby location (4) supplied with seats (1) by a first conveyor (3), a reference location supplied with vehicle bodies (2) by a second conveyor (5), a robot (6) for transferring seats (1) from the standby location (4) to the reference location for the bodies (2); the robot including an end gripper (10) consisting of two sucking box structures (15) and (16), the active faces (17, 18) of which are contained within substantially perpendicular planes, the box structures being supported with compliance by a support structure (12, 13, 14) articulated to the end (9) of the robot arm.

A fitting station for fitting a seat (1) in the interior of the 
passenger compartment of a vehicle (2), the seat comprising a lower 

structure (1a) for fastening to the body of the vehicle, the station 
comprising a waiting location (4) supplied with seats (1) by a first 

conveyor (3), a reference location supplied with vehicle bodies (2) by a 
second conveyor (5), a robot (6) for transferring seats (1) from the 

waiting location (4) towards the reference location of the bodies (2), the 
robot (6) comprising an end gripper (10), characterised in that the end 

gripper (10) is formed by two suction cases (15) and (16) of which the 
active faces (17, 18) are contained in substantially perpendicular planes, 

the cases being supported by a deformable connection on a support 
structure (12, 13, 14) pivoted to the end (9) of the robot arm. 
A fitting station according to claim 1 characterised in that it 
comprises a station (50) for measuring the position of the lower structure 

(1a) of the seat with respect to the robot (6). 
A station according to claim 1 or claim 2 characterised in that 
the support structure (12, 13, 14) defines two reference faces forming a 

projecting dihedron, to each of which a suction case (15, 16) is fastened 
by means of a plurality of slides (27 to 30) which are substantially 

perpendicular to the plane of the corresponding surface, each slide being 
mounted slidably with respect to the structure (12, 13, 14) and 

elastically connected to the case (15, 16) while a controlled lock 
permits immobilisation of the slide with respect to the structure. 
A fitting station according to claim 3 characterised in that the 
lock comprises a pad (41) for clamping the slide (30) against its guide 

(39), controlled by a pneumatically deformable diaphragm (36).
