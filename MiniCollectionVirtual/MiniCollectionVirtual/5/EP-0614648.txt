<ABSTRACT>
Active elements for a) surgical gripping instruments, device for the vertical opening and closing of the bit members and a device for increasing the bit surfaces as multifunctional active elements for the gentle, atraumatic gripping and holding of organs, tissues, vessels, for ligating and suturing; and b) the active elements for surgical cutting instruments comprising two blades, one of which can also be used as a dissection electrode, and an electrode for bipolar coagulation is attached in parallel with the blade electrode, for cutting, dissecting and bipolar coagulation. These gripping and cutting instruments are used in minimally invasive and intracorporeal endoscopic surgery.
