<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for the read-out of an image stored on a phosphor plate (1) in dental X-ray photography, by means of a laser beam (4) directed at the plate surface. The method comprises a preliminary read-out step and, thereafter, a final read-out step which provides the desired information and in which setting values determined on the basis of the preliminary read-out are used. According to the invention, the preliminary read-out is carried out on the marginal region (5) of the image, including mainly jawbone, and the final read-out is carried out on the central region (8) of the image, including the denture and the interdental spaces. The amplification used in the final read-out can in this case be adjusted on the basis of the preliminary read-out so that the darkest regions of the image, i.e. the interdental spaces, will be black. The preliminary read-out and the final read-out can be linked to a reciprocal movement of a phosphor plate (1) drawn out of a protective casing (2) and returned into it, and the deletion of the information from the plate, subsequent to the read-out, can be linked to a second reciprocal movement of the plate.

<DESCRIPTION>
Method for the read-out of an exposed phosphor plate in dental X-ray photographyThe present invention relates to a method in dental X-ray pho¬ tography for the read-out of an image, stored on a phosphor plate, by means of a beam directed at the surface of the plate, the method comprising a preliminary read-out step and, there¬ after, the final read-out step which will yield the desired information and in which setting values determined on the basis of the preliminary read-out will be used.The purpose of the preliminary read-out is to determine the radiation dose received by the phosphor plate in the exposure, and on the basis of this dose the optimal amplification by the read-out amplifier is adjusted for the final read-out step. The purpose is to find the gain level which makes maximal use of the conversion range of the analog/digital converter used in the read-out. The gain can be adjusted to the correct level if the signal intensity of those regions of the image which have received the largest amount of X-radiation is known. In a nor¬ mal dental radiograph these regions are the interdental spaces, which are shown black in the radiograph. The denture and the interdental spaces will usually be in the central region of the radiograph, but the exact locations of the interdental spaces cannot be anticipated.Regions which have received the largest amount of X-radiation can be sought by adjusting the amplification during the image read-out. However, in this case the gain in the middle of the image may change, whereupon the read-out result will not be optimal. Since part of the latent image on the phosphor plate will disappear during the image read-out, there is also no sense in reading out the image a second time using the amplifi¬ cation which could be set on the basis of the first read-out.US patent publication 4,527,060 discloses a method of prelim- 

inary read-out using a mechanism by which the intensity of the laser beam used for the read-out is lowered and/or the laser dot is enlarged, whereupon the intensity of the radiation im¬ pinging on the phosphor plate will lower to a level at which the latent image on the phosphor plate will substantially be retained. The preliminary read-out is carried out using this lowered-intensity laser dot, and on the basis of this read-out the necessary read-out amplifier parameters are set for the final full-intensity read-out of the image. According to the said patent, the preliminary read-out is targeted on the entire image surface, or at least on those regions of

Claims
1. A method for the read-out of an image stored on a phos¬ phor plate (1) in dental X-ray photography, by means of a beam (4) directed at the plate surface, the method comprising a pre¬ liminary read-out step and thereafter a final read-out step which will provide the desired information and in which setting values determined on the basis of the preliminary read-out will be used, characterized in that the preliminary read-out is car¬ ried out on the marginal region (5) of the image, including in the main jawbone or the like, and the final read-out is carried out on the central region (8) of the image, including the in¬ formation desired from the image, such as the denture and the interdental spaces.
2. A method according to Claim 1, characterized in that the preliminary read-out takes place during a mutual linear move¬ ment of the phosphor plate (1) and the read-out device (3) , and the final read-out during a mutual linear movement of the phos¬ phor plate and the read-out device in the reverse direction.
3. A method according to Claim 2, characterized in that the phosphor plate (1) is drawn out of a protective casing (2) and the preliminary read-out is carried out in connection with the drawing out, in a read-out station (3) outside the protective casing, and that the final read-out is carried out in the same read-out station (3) while the phosphor plate is returning into the protective cover.
4. A method according to Claim 2 or 3, characterized in tha those image (1) regions (5) which frame one side (6) and the two opposite ends (7) of the image are read out in the prelim¬ inary read-out step, and that the rest (8) of the image is read out in the final read-out step.
5. A method according to any of Claims 2-4, characterized i that after the read-out steps the information is deleted from 


the phosphor plate (1) by means of a deleting light directed the surface of the plate, which has been brought into linear motion.
6. A method according to Claims 3 and 5, characterized in that after the read-out steps, the phosphor plate (1) is draw again out of the protective casing (2) and the information is deleted from it in a deleting station (14) which is outside t protective casing and suitably located next to the read-out station.
7. A method according to any of the above claims, charac¬ terized in that in the final read-out step the highest-degree darkness of the image, corresponding to the interdental spaces is adjusted to a substantially higher degree of darkness than the prevailing darkness determined in the preliminary read-ou corresponding to the jawbone, preferably at about three times the darkness.
8. A method according to any of Claims 1-6, characterized that in cases in which there are substantial variations of darkness in the marginal regions (5) of the image, which have been read out preliminarily, the highest degree of darkness corresponding to the interdental spaces is selected and, for the final read-out step, the highest degree of darkness of the image is adjusted on the basis of it.
