<ABSTRACT>
To supply supercritical fluid to an automatic supercritical fluid extractor and collect extract from the extractor, sample holding cartridges (30A) are lifted one by one in series by an elevator plug into a pressure chamber (24A). An inlet at the top of the cartridge (30A) engages a pressure vessel inlet for the extractant so that extractant flows into the cartridge (30A) and into the space between the cartridge and inner walls of the pressure chamber (24A). The outlets from the cartridge (30A) and pressure vessel communicate with the collector (408) and exhaust through passageways in the plug. The plug has cleaning ports for cleaning seals and the outlet from the cartridge (30A) flows past the seals. The collector (408) lifts vials into place and can precool the collection solvent, and later as part of the collection procedure, heat and pressurize the collector (408).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to supercritical fluid
extraction and more particularly relates to a
reciprocating pump for pumping liquid near its
supercritical temperature in such systems.In supercritical fluid extraction, an
extraction vessel is held at a temperature above the
critical point and is supplied with fluid at a
pressure above the critical pressure. Under these
conditions, the fluid within the extraction vessel
is a supercritical fluid. In one type of apparatus
for supercritical extraction, there is a specially
constructed extraction vessel within a source of
heat.A prior art apparatus for supercritical
extraction of this type is described by B.W. Wright,
et. al., in ANAL.CHEM.59, 38-44 (January 1987)
using a glass-lined extraction chamber within a
bolted stainless steel extraction vessel heated in
an oven. This type of extraction apparatus has the
disadvantages of: (1) requiring time consuming
steps to open the pressurized extraction vessel
before use to insert the sample and again to open it
after use to remove the spent sample; and (2) under 
some circumstances, requiring the handling of a hot
extraction vessel.Prior art apparatuses for automatically
changing samples are known from United States Patent
5,160,624 which discloses a supercritical fluid
extraction apparatus that changes samples in a
series of cartridges.It is a task of the invention to provide a
novel supercritical extraction collection apparatus
that improves trapping efficiency by controlling the
temperature and pressure of the collection vial and
yet is automatically loaded without the need for
handling by an operator.To accomplish this task, means for performing
supercritical fluid extraction and means for
collecting analyte in a series of containers are
provided. The means for collecting analyte includes
means for moving a container into position up on a container top
holder holding a restrictor, means for sealing the opening of said
container with said container top holder, means for pressurizing the container
wherein 
gasified supercritical fluid is permitted to pass via said
restrictor into a collection solvent in said container.The collection means is in contact with the
means for performing supercritical fluid extraction
and includes means for controlling the temperature
of a collecting vial. The means for controlling the
temperature includes a pivoted, sliding aluminum
block in contact with the vial and incorporates at
least one of CO2 cooling and electric heating means.
The collection means incorporates means for
controll
