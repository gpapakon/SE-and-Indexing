A anti-reuse device (7) actuated by the medium moved by the piston (4) is arranged in an inlet area (37) of the injection cylinder (2) that faces the injection needle (6) and has a switching member (22) with a sealing section (48) having a larger cross-sectional surface than the cross-section of an opening (33) provided in a retaining member (21). Said sealing section (48) is retained in a rest position with a circular ring-shaped retaining member (21) which is elastically deformable in the radial direction or in the direction of the injection needle (6) on the side of the retaining member (21) that faces the piston (4). In the locking position of the switching member (22), the sealing section (48) is located on the side of the retaining member (21) that faces the injection needle (6); said retaining member (21) is designed as a sealing stop for the switching member (22) in the direction of the piston (4). A reception room for the switching member (22) or for its sealing section (48) is arranged between the retaining member (21) and the injection needle (6). The retaining member (21) is made of an elastically restorable material and is held in position inside of or shaped on the housing (18) of the anti-reuse device (7) set inside the inner chamber (3) of the injection cylinder (2) and made of a harder material than the material of which the retaining member (21) is made. The switching member (22) has a guiding element (23) adjacent to the sealing section (48) which is guided in a guiding path (49) of the housing (18) or of the injection cylinder (2). The guiding length between the guiding element (23) and the guiding path (49) is longer than at least the distance between the rest and locking positions of the switching organ (22).
