<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of an apparatus and a detection unit for sanning an optically readable record carrier (1), in which a light beam modulated by the information marks in a track on the record carrier is incident on the detection unit (15) comprising four detectors. A reliable tracking error signal based on time differences between detector signals is obtained for high-density recording by comparing digitized signals of the detectors with a delayed signal Td generated by delay unit (45) based on the digitized signals. The time differences between the detector signals result in length differences between pulses in the comparing signals A and B, which pulses have a nominal length of Td. The comparing signals A and B are low-pass filtered and combined to generate the tracking error signal TE.

<DESCRIPTION>
Apparatus and detection unit for scanning an optically readable record carrier.The invention relates to an apparatus for scanning a record carrier having a track comprising optically readable marks representing information, which apparatus comprises means for scanning the record carrier via a radiation beam and tracking means for controlling the position of the radiation beam in a direction transverse to the track direction on the basis of a tracking error signal, the tracking means comprising a detection unit including a multitude of detectors for receiving the radiation beam via the record carrier and an electronic circuit for generating the tracking error signal in dependence on time differences between a first signal and a second signal, the first and second signals being derived from output signals of the detectors. The invention further relates to a detection unit for use in such apparatus.Such an apparatus and detection unit are known from United States Patent 4,057,833. The apparatus generates the tracking error signal by manipulating the high- frequency signals of the detectors and low-pass filtering the resulting signal. The detector signals are combined and thereafter compared in the analog domain to generate the tracking error signal in dependence on the phase or time difference between said combined signals. A problem of the apparatus is that the value of the tracking error signal is less reliable for short marks representing the information in high-density recording.It is an object of the invention to provide means for scanning a record carrier which generate a tracking error signal which is more reliable.For this purpose, an apparatus and detection unit as described in the opening paragraph are characterized according to the invention in that the detection unit comprises digitizing means for digitizing the first and second signal, delaying means for generating a delayed signal based on the first and/or second digitized signal and comparing means for comparing the delayed signal and the first and/or second digitized signals for generating the tracking error signal.The invention is also based on the following recognition. For the short marks in high-density recording, the time difference which needs to be detected may become small, 

e.g. in the order of a few ns. If the first and second signals are compared directly to generate a signal representing the time difference, very short pulses will be generated. To handle such short pulses, fast circuits and circuits designed for very high
