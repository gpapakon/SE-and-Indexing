<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor module consists of a metal base (1), a copper-coated ceramic substrate (2) and semiconductor bodies (4). The parts are inserted into an elastomer mould (5) and a pressure piston (plunger) (7) with concave surface is applied to the base plate. The parts of the module are then deformed by heat such that the base plate and at least the ceramic substrate are convex relative to a cooling body.

<CLAIMS>
Method for the production of a semiconductor 
module structure, having a metal base plate, having a 

ceramic substrate, provided with a metallization and 
connected to the baseplate by positive interlocking, and 

having semiconductor bodies connected by positive interlocking 
to the metallization, in which method the baseplate 

is convexly deformed by a pressure ram, characterized 
in that the semiconductor bodies (4), the ceramic 

substrate and the baseplate (1) are placed in an elastomer 
pressure mould (5), in that a heatable pressure ram 

(7), having a surface which is concave relative to the 
baseplate, is applied to the baseplate, and at least the 

baseplate and the ceramic substrate are deformed and 
connected by the pressure of the pressure ram at a 

temperature higher than room temperature. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that metal layers (12, 13; 15, 16) are present between 

the semiconductor bodies (4), the metallization (3) and 
the baseplate (1), and connect together the said parts by 

pressure sintering. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that metal layers (20, 21; 22, 23) are present between 

the semiconductor bodies (4), the metallization (3) and 
the baseplate (1), and connect together the said parts by 

diffusion welding. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the semiconductor bodies (4), the metallization (3) 

and the baseplate (1) are soldered before the pressure 
mould (5) is introduced, and in that the temperature 

during deformation is lower than the melting temperature 
of the solder.
