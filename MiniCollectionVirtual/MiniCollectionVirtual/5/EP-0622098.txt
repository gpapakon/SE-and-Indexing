<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a locking plate for ski bindings, with drilled holes for fixing screws, the wall of the drilled hole having shoulders for retaining the unmounted fixing screws, which shoulders are arranged in an offset manner along the circumference of the drilled hole and, with their inner sides, extend as far as the core diameter of the fixing screw which is to be inserted. In this fixing plate, in order to achieve simple manufacture for the shoulders and easy operation of the fixing screws, the invention provides for the shoulders (6-8) to be provided in the drilled hole (4) at the same height on the wall and in an arrangement corresponding to the sides (9a-c) of an equilateral triangle (9), the sides (9a-c) of the triangle extending tangentially to a circle (K1), whose diameter corresponds to the core diameter (d) of the fixing screws (5), and for the inner sides (6a-8a) of the individual shoulders (6-8), observed in plan view and in the direction of the longitudinal medium axis of the drilled hole (4), each to extend along an arc which passes through the tangential point defined by the circle (K1) and by the side (9a-c) of the triangle (9) associated with the arc.
