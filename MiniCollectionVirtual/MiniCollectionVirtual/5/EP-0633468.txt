<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to capillary systems, produced using microtechnology, for the integration of a plurality of chemical microsensors based on ISFETs. With the invention, the microcapillary (1) is configured such that the measurement fluid to be analysed is forced to flow round, and is therefore forced to wet, the chemical microsensors integrated into the microcapillary, that is to say their sensitive membrane regions (3). This forced flowing around is constructionally produced by introduction of so-called channel stoppers (2) which minimise the production of dead volumes. The microcapillary according to the invention having integrated chemical microsensors in this case offers the advantage that, by using the channel stoppers, the measurement fluid can be optimally brought into contact with the sensitive region of the sensor, as a result of which an improved response in dynamic operation is achieved. In order to construct the microcapillary, use is made of an anisotropic silicon-structuring technique which allows, according to each application case, the geometrically ideal design of the capillary and of the channel stopper in the region of the chemically sensitive membrane for optimum flow guidance. By using reflow soldering with low-melting solder or employing cold-setting adhesive during mounting of the microsensors, improved mounting while avoiding high thermal or stress loads is guaranteed and flexible replacement of failed sensors is facilitated.

<CLAIMS>
Micro-capillary (1) with integrated chemical micro-sensors,
consisting of a micro-technically structured, optionally

branched or coiled capillary (1) in a wafer (4)
with, in addition, openings forming a connection to the

chemical sensitive areas of the micro-sensors, characterised
in that in the area of these openings within the capillary

(1) channel stoppers (2) are provided, which cause
a forced irrigation of the micro-sensors within the openings

in form of a flow diversion.
Method for the manufacture of a micro-capillary (1) in accordance
with Claim 1, characterised in that the channel

later forming the capillary (1) including the connection-openings
and the channel-stoppers (2) remaining in the

channel are formed in a silicon-wafer (4) by a bilateral
structuring-process and that the side of the wafer (4)

carrying the microchannel is subsequently covered with a
glass-disk and the openings appearing on the opposite surface

are covered with the micro-sensors.
Method for the manufacture of a micro-capillary (1) in accordance
with Claim 2, characterised in that the installation

of the micro-sensors on the structured wafer (4) is

effected by reflow soldering using low melting solders or
cold-setting adhesive.
