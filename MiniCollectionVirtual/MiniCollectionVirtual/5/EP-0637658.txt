<ABSTRACT>
An open grid fabric (400) for reinforcing wall systems and a method of making same. 

First (410) and second (420) sets of substantially parallel, selected rovings are 
combined using certain knits, leno weaves, or adhesive methods. The rovings are 

direct-sized with at least a silane sizing and preferably have a linear density between 
100 and 2000 grams per thousand meters and are arranged at an average of 3 to 10 ends 

per inch. A polymeric coating is applied to the fabric at a level of 10 to 150 parts dry 
weight of resin (440) to 100 parts by weight of the fabric while assuring that the open 

grid remains open (445). A method for reinforcing a wall system and a wall segment 
product utilizing the novel open grid fabric of the present invention are also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to fabrics for reinforcing 
stucco layers on walls, particularly on rigid foam 
insulation boards. Such fabrics are made in the form 
of a grid with openings between the strands. The 
fabrics are then coated with a resin which does not 
close the openings. The open grid fabric of this 
invention is made from certain selected rovings by weft 
insertion warp knitting, by certain weaving techniques, 
or by securing a laid, nonwoven grid together by 
adhesive alone. The present invention also relates to 
methods of making such reinforcement fabric, to methods 
for reinforcing such wall systems, and to wall segments 
that utilize the novel reinforcement disclosed herein. A popular method of constructing walls comprises a wall 
system in which a rigid plastic foam insulation board  
 
is bonded to a concrete or other wall. The insulation 
board is covered with a layer of reinforcement fabric, 
and thereafter a stucco or stucco-like material is 
applied to the fabric and board to embed and cover the 
fabric. The fabric may be initially attached to the 
insulation board mechanically with staples, nails, 
screws or the like. Alternatively, the fabric may be 
attached to the insulation board by means of an 
adhesive spread onto the insulation board. The stucco-like 
material, which is often referred to as a base 
coat, is typically a polymer modified cement 
containing, for example, Portland cement and an acrylic 
or other polymer or copolymer. During fabrication of 
the wall system, the fabric is buried in the stucco-like 
material. Openings in the fabric permit the 
stucco-like material to be pushed through the fabric 
and contact the insulation board. The stucco-like 
layer with reinforcement fabric buried in it may range 
from about 1,59mm (1/16 inch) to 6,35 mm (1/4 inch) thick. Finally, a 
finishing coat is usually placed on top of the base 
coat to provide, among other things, better appearance 
and perhaps better weather resistance. In such wall systems, a wall segment may be prepared 
either in situ on the outside of a building or in the 
form of prefabricated panels. A primary purpose of the reinforcement fabric in these 
systems is to provide the wall with impact resistance 
for durability. The reinforcement fabric must, 
however, have several performance and application 
requirements: (1) the reinforcement should be 
economical; (2) the reinforcement should be as light in 
weight as possible; (3) the reinforcement should in 
greatly increase the impact resistance of the wall 
sys
