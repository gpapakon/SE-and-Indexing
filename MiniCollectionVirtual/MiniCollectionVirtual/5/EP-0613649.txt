<ABSTRACT>
The process consists in taking a fabric piece (1) of a 
width (A) corresponding to that of the cleaning cloth to be 

obtained and subjecting it to successive intermittent 
transversal cuts (3) in the direction of the weft, spaced 

according to the length (D) of the cleaning cloth, which 
cuts prevent unravelling and help the user to detach each 

cleaning cloth individually from the rest of the piece (1), 
the cleaning cloth having longitudinal edges which may not 

be unravelled in the direction of the warp. If the piece of 
fabric is of a width (mA) which is a multiple of the 

envisaged width (A) of the cleaning cloths (2), 
longitudinal cuts (5) are made in the piece of fabric 

spaced apart from each other (A) in the direction of the 
warp, after which intermittent transversal cuts (3) are 

made. 
The resulting cleaning cloth (2) consists in a rectangular 
portion of f
abric whose four edges may not be unravelled.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a process for obtaining 
disposable cleaning cloths and the resulting disposable 
cleaning cloth. Until now, cleaning cloths have been used for 
household and industrial cleaning, at a relatively high 
cost, since they are generally obtained from pieces of 
fabric which on output from the loom are subjected to a 
number of conventional continuous or batch industrial 
finishing processes, which pieces are then subjected after 
cutting thereof to an operation of making-up the edges. The 
aforesaid making-up process notably increases the cost of 
the cleaning cloth, which means that it has to undergo 
frequent washing operations for subsequent re-use, whether 
it has been put to household or industrial uses, such as in 
factories and workshops, and others. The cleaning cloths 
generally known therefore present the disadvantages of 
their high price owing to the making-up process they 
require, and the fact that they call for very thorough 
cleaning if they are to be used again, owing to the grease 
and other major dirt impregnating them. Also known are individual tear-off rolls or hand 
tissues and the like, of paper or non-woven fabric, made 
for certain uses, although they do not have the right 
consistency for certain jobs in the household and 
industrial (factories, workshops, etc.) settings, and, 
although they are disposable, that is, they are single-use 
articles, they do not fulfil the expectations held of 
cleaning cloths, although they are of low cost. According to FR-A-1 194 801, a cleaning cloth is 
obtained from a band made up of several cleaning cloths 
joined together by means of adhesive which permits 
subsequent individual detachment of said cleaning cloths, 
while according to FR-A-2 319 489 a two-sided cleaning  
 
cloth is obtained, one side being fibrous and the other 
impermeable, forming a roll with partial transversal cuts 
at intervals and with adhesive to sides, thus providing for 
subsequent individual detachment of the cleaning cloths. The cleaning cloths referred to in these two patents 
do not have their four side edges ravel-free. The present invention eliminates the aforesaid 
disadvantages of conventional made-up fabric cleaning 
cloths and of individual paper or fabric tear-off rolls or 
hand tissues and the like, since it has as its object a 
process for manufacturing disposable cleaning cloths and 
the resulting disposable cleaning cloth itself, and 
presents the advantages of consistency of made-up fabric 
cleaning cloths, providing same at a

<CLAIMS>
A process for obtaining disposable cleaning 
cloths, starting from woven or knit fabric (1) made of 

natural, synthetic fibres or mixtures of the two, which 
upon going out from the loom is subjected to conventional 

continuos or batch finishing processes, which fabric piece 
is successively subjected to intermittent transversal 

cuts (3) in the direction of the weft which are 
mutually spaced according to the length (d) of the 

cleaning cloth, the user being thus able to individually 
detach each cleaning cloth (2) from the rest of the 

fabric piece (1), characterized in that the fabric piece 
(1) has the width according to a multiple (mA) of 

the width (A) envisaged in the cleaning cloths (2) and 
longitudinal cuts (5) are made in the fabric piece 

in the direction of the warp, and spaced according to 
width (A) of the cleaning cloths (2), after which 

transversal cuts (3) are carried out intermittently or continuously 
in the direction of the weft, said longitudinal (5) and transversal 

(3) cuts 
are made in the fabric piece such that during the 

cutting operation itself or during a successive bonding operation, 
the bonding 

together of the cut threads is achieved with the purpose 
to prevent the unravelling of the edges in the disposable 

cleaning cloth (2) obtained.  
 
The process of Claims 1, wherein the bonding 
of the threads in the cutting zones is implemented by 

printing (25), the transversal cuts (3') being continuous 
or intermittent. 
The process of Claim 2, wherein the cleaning 
cloths (2') resulting from the continuous cuts are 

commercialized rolled one on top of the other with a 
transversal rear-edge zone (Bp) of one cleaning cloth 

overlapping the transversal front-edge zone (Bd) of the 
following cleaning cloth (2'). 
The process of Claim 2, wherein a rectangular 
cleaning cloth is obtained, with stamped and ravel-free 

edges (25'). 
The process of Claim 1, wherein the continuous or 
intermittent longitudinal cuts (5a), in the direction of 

the warp, and the transversal cuts (3'a), in the direction 
of the weft, are made in a single cutting operation (T). 
The process of Claim 5, wherein the bonding (E) 
of the threads in the cutting zones (25) is effected in an 

independent operation, or simultaneously with the cutting 
operation (T). 
A disposable cleaning cloth, obtained by the 
process of the previous Claims, which consists in a 

rectangular portion (2) of fabric which has ravel-free 
edges.
