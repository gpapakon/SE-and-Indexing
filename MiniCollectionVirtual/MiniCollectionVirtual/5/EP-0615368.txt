<ABSTRACT>
Voice, facsimile, and electronic mail messaging is integrated in a system 
that converts e-mail messages into voice-and-fax messages. An e-mail 

message (400) is parsed into voiceable, prose, segments (403) and non-voiceable, 
non-prose, segments (404). Prose segments are converted into voice message 

segments (503) via text-to-speech facilities. Each non-prose segment is converted 
into a fax segment (504). Voice pointers (505) to fax segments are inserted into the 

voice message, in places corresponding to the non-prose segments in the e-mail 
message. The voice file (500) and fax file (510) are then stored for subsequent 

delivery of the message as an integrated voice-and-fax message. Conversion of 
integrated voice-and-fax messages into e-mail messages is likewise envisioned.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to integrated message systems, and 
specifically to voice-and-fax message systems and electronic mail systems. Multi-media messaging involves integrating discrete messages or 
individual message components of different media, e.g., voice, text, video, and the 
ability to deliver the integrated messages through a single universal mailbox. The integration of voice and facsimile (fax) messages is well known in 
the art. For example, U.S. Patent No. 5,008,926, discloses an integrated voice-and-facsimile 
store-and-forward message system that provides for the sending, storage, 
and delivery of voice messages, fax messages, fax messages annotated with voice 
messages, and voice messages annotated with fax messages. The disclosed system 
additionally provides for display of fax messages on terminal screens, and the 
conversion of fax printed text messages into voice messages via text-to-speech 
conversion facilities. Electronic mail, or e-mail, systems are also well known in the art. They 
provide for the sending, storage, and delivery between computer terminals of 
displayable data --text and/or graphics-- messages. Integration of e-mail systems with voice-and-fax message systems is 
highly desirable. For example, it is becoming common for salesmen to work out of 
"mobile offices" --their cars-- which are equipped normally with telephones, often 
with fax machines, but generally not with data terminals, yet the salesmen would 
like to have the capability of receiving in their mobile offices messages sent to them 
in any form --voice, fax, or e-mail. The integration of fax and e-mail messaging is 
readily accomplished through conversion of e-mail messages into fax messages for 
delivery to their recipients. But while fax machines are more likely to be available 
to mobile recipients of the messages than data terminals, they are not as readily 
available as telephones. Therefore, it is often preferable to instead accomplish the 
integration of voice and e-mail messaging through conversion of e-mail messages 
into voice messages for delivery to their recipients. This type of conversion is also 
readily accomplished if the e-mail messages constitute text only. A problem arises, however, when e-mail messages constitute 
information other than text --such as diagrams, charts, special symbols, computer 
code fragments, pictures, etc.-- which is not suitable for conversion into a voice 
message. Attempts to convert such data message segments into speech result in 
unintelligible
