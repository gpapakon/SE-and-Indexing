<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of pending
United States and where applicable their corresponding PCT
Applications:
(a) Serial No. 07/885,318, filed April 9, 1992 which
is a continuation-in-part of pending United States Application
Serial No. 07/502,559, filed March 30, 1990; and(b) Serial No. 07/843,752, filed February 28, 1992.This invention pertains to compositions and methods for
suppression of T-cell mediated or T-cell dependent autoimmune
response. More specifically, the invention is directed to
compositions comprising peptide fragments of myelin basic protein
(MBP) or analogs thereof, and to methods of using such peptides
and compositions to anergize, or to stop proliferation of, human
T-cells specific for myelin basic protein, or to elicit active
suppression of such T-cells. Peptides according to the invention
are also useful in identifying CD4+ T-cells reactive with myelin
basic protein.The discussion in this section is not limited to
discussion of work that qualifies as "prior art" against the
present invention. Therefore, no such admission and no
declaration against the present inventors' interests shall be
implied by reason of this discussion.Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory
disease of the white matter of the human central nervous system 
and is believed to be of autoimmune etiology. Regardless of its
etiology, MS is accompanied by autoimmune attack of nerve tissue
For example, the disease is characterized by prominent T-cell and
macrophage infiltrates into nervous tissue (i.e., the brain,
spinal cord, peripheral nerves or associated cell types),
demyelination and neurological dysfunction. Myelin basic protein
(MBP) has been extensively studied by the present inventors,
their co-workers and others as an autoantigen in the disease
because of its role as an inducing agent in the major animal
model of MS, experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), as
well as its role in the human disease post-viral
encephalomyelitis. In addition, the present inventors and their
co-workers have studied MBP as a "bystander antigen" (Serial No.
843,752, supra).A major hypothesis regarding the pathogenesis of MS is
that T-cells reactive with myelin basic protein in the white
matter of the CNS initiate the inflammatory process. Another
hypothesis is that T-cells reactive with proteolipid protein
(PLP) initiate the inflammatory process. The demonstration that
activated T-cells specific for myelin basic protein (MBP) can be
isolated from MS patients (Allegretta, M., et al., Science:
