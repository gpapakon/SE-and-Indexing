<ABSTRACT>
A display assembly which is positionable substantially adjacent 
to a printed circuit board within an interior of a computer housing 

includes a display device positionable within the interior of the 
computer housing. The display assembly further includes a protective 

base, secured between the printed circuit board and the display 
device, wherein the protective base has (1) a display retaining portion 

and (2) a brace portion, secured to the display retaining portion, for 
reducing torsional deformation of the display retaining portion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to computers,
and more particularly to a display assembly which is
positionable within an interior of a computer housing.There exists numerous designs of display devices which
are used in computers. One type of computer which uses a
display device is a portable computer. Portable computers
are typically transported from a storage site to a remote
operating site and then back to the storage site. The
mobility of the portable computer exposes it to substantial
risk of damage, especially to the display device used
therein. The display device is particularly susceptible to
damage since it has low tolerance for torsional deformation
(i.e. deformation of the device by twisting or otherwise
altering the shape of the device relative to its normal or
relaxed state). Torsional deformation of the display device
may occur when mechanical force is applied to the housing of
the computer, for instance, when a portable computer is
inadvertently dropped from a height of a few feet.An article entitled "Packaging the computer for rough
service", published in Electronic Packaging and Production,
vol. 33, no. 9, September 1993, Massachusetts US, pages 30-32,
XP413176, Hoyle describes an apparatus for containing
and supporting electronic components. The apparatus has a
shock-resistant case made of plastics material for absorbing
and dissipating shock.WO90/15359 (Poqet Computer Corporation) discloses a
mounting for a liquid crystal display in a portable
computer. This document discloses that conventionally LCDs are mounted in a portable
computer housing in a metal frame or two hard plastic two-piece shell which
structurally supports the LCD. and discloses that these arrangements offer
little protection against damage. To absorb the impact stress, this document
discloses as a third embodiment a display assembly for an LCD display
device that includes a frame formed of polycarbonat (Lexan); a horizontal
plate formed of polycarbonate; chock absorbers and a housing formed of
ABS/polycarbonate alloy. The housing of the display assembly acts as a
protective base which has upwardly extending sides which may be
considered as stiffening means for inhibiting torsional deformation of the
display device and a back wall which may be considered as a display
retaining portion. The LCD frame is a plate having an inside perimeter and
an outside perimeter. The inside perimeter defines a display window and is
shaped with a flange. The LCD frame is placed over the LCD and screws are
inserted to attach LCD
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A display assembly (10) for an LCD display device (28) comprising a frame
(34) and a protective base (32) both secured to each other and to the display

device for supporting said display device (28), the protective base (32)
