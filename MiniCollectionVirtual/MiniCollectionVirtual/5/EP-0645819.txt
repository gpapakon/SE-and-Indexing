<ABSTRACT>
In a semiconductor device including a plurality 
of semiconductor cells each of which has a diffusion 

area, a first metal layer, and a connecting portion, the 
first metal layer overlies whole of the diffusion area 

while the connecting portion covers almost whole of the 
diffusion area. The semiconductor device further 

includes a second metal layer, and first and second power 
supply lines. The second metal layer has an 

interconnecting area positioned above the semiconductor 
cells and an overlapping area overlapping on the first 

metal layer. Each of the first and the second power 
supply lines consists of the overlapping area. The 

semiconductor cells are electrically connected to each 
other by a third metal layer and the interconnecting area 

of the second metal layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a semiconductor device
which comprises complementary metal oxide semiconductor
(CMOS) and the like, which is for use in a semiconductor
integrated circuit.In such a semiconductor integrated circuit, a
plurality of basic semiconductor cells are combined and
electrically connected to each other to form a large
scale logic circuit.As will later be described more in detail, a
conventional semiconductor device of the type described
comprises a plurality of semiconductor cells each of
which includes a diffusion area, first metal layers which
form internal conductor patterns in the semiconductor
cell. The first metal layers partially overlie the
diffusion area. The semiconductor cell further comprises
a plurality of contacts, second metal layers, first and
second power supply terminals. The contacts connect the
diffusion area to the first metal layers. The first and
the second power supply terminals have comparatively
large width and are composed of the first metal layers. However, in the conventional semiconductor cell,
wide portions of the first metal layers which define the
first and the second power supply terminals partially
overlie the diffusion area. It is not possible that the
contacts are formed to cover almost whole of the
diffusion area. As a result, a parasitic resistance of
the diffusion area inevitably prevents high speed
operation of the conventional semiconductor cell.In order to make it possible that the contacts
are formed to cover almost whole of the diffusion area,
it should be abolished that the first metal layers which
define the first and the second power supply terminals
are overlapping on the diffusion area. However, when
such an overlap is abolished, the conventional
semiconductor cell becomes large in size, so that the
conventional semiconductor device, as a whole, would also
be too large in size.Furthermore, in the conventional semiconductor
device, it is necessary that patterning spaces are
preserved at both sides of the semiconductor device. In
other words, the second metal layers are made to be
extended up to the patterning spaces at the both sides so
as to electrically connect the semiconductor cells with
each other. In this event, length of wiring patterns
between the semiconductor cells inevitably becomes large.
Therefore, the conventional semiconductor device becomes
so large in size by the patterning spaces which should be
preserved at the both sides. Accordingly, it becomes 
difficult that the conventional semiconductor devices are
integrated in an
