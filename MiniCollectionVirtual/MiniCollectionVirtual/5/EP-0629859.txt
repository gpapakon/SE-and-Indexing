<ABSTRACT>
Purpose: to judge shortage of a discharge quantity, by identifying the presence of any bubbles at the time of discharge. 

Constitution: characteristics (101) involving bubbles provides a different internal pressure of a nozzle at nearly the end of discharge 
of a sample than that provided by characteristics (100) not involving bubbles. The nozzle internal pressure is detected at 

the time of judgement (105), and this detection value is compared with a threshold value. Accordingly, the occurrence of the bubbles 
can be judged, and shortage of a discharge quantity is judged on the basis of this judgement to give an alarm.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pipetting apparatus,
and more particularly relates to a pipetting apparatus
having the ability to determine if the volume of a sample
dispensed is insufficient, during the dispensing of samples
into containers with the use of a nozzle, by detecting the
presence of air bubbles inside the nozzle, for instance.There are known pipetting apparatuses for pipetting
samples, which are used, for example, as distribution
apparatuses that distribute blood extracted from human
bodies and the like into a plurality of containers.In such apparatuses, aspiration of the sample is
performed through a disposable nozzle. In this case, in
order to make certain that a prescribed volume of sample is
pipetted, it is required to make sure that an appropriate
volume of sample is aspirated into the inside of the nozzle
at the aspirating operation. However, when such aspiration
is taking place without considering presence of bubbles, the
accuracy of the volume of sample aspirated will not be
precise if bubbles get aspirated together with the sample.
Consequently, the volume of such sample pipetted will have a
lower degree of accuracy.In this connection, the applicant of this application 
previously proposed, in Japanese Laid-Open Publication No.
2-196963, a pipetting apparatus, in which the pressure
within an air tube connected to the nozzle is detected by a
pressure sensor when aspirating sample, whereby an
insufficient aspiration of the sample is determined when an
integrated value of the detected pressure is lower than a
predetermined reference value.However, if the volume of sample being dispensed is not
precise at the time when the sample is dispensed, it is not
possible to improve the pipetting accuracy. Namely, when
tiny bubbles like foams seen in beer are generated due to
vibrations and the like caused when the nozzle is being
moved, and then thus generated tiny bubbles float up to
collect near the top part of the sample contained in the
nozzle, there is a case that these bubbles remain in the
inside of the tip of the nozzle even after the sample has
been dispensed, resulting in an inaccurate volume of sample
being dispensed. Moreover, after a sample has been
dispensed, there is a case that a small amount of the sample
remains in the form of a balloon-shaped bubble that is
formed around the tip of the nozzle and dangles down
therefrom, and this also results in an inaccurate volume of
sample being dispensed. Of course, in the conventional
apparatus, factors such as the adhesion of the

<CLAIMS>
A pipetting apparatus having a nozzle (10) for carrying out aspirating and
dispensing of a sample comprising a pressure sensor (22) for determining the

pressure inside the nozzle (10),
characterized in that
the pressure sensor is provided such that it determines the pressure at a
prescribed determination time (105) just before the completion of the

dispensing of the sample,
a threshold value storage section (34) is provided for storing a prescribed
threshold value; and
a determination section is provided which determines the presence of bubbles
when the actual pressure inside the nozzle (10) determined on the basis of the

output of the pressure sensor (22) exceeds the threshold value at the
prescribed determination time (105).
