<ABSTRACT>
A tilting and emptying device consisting of a swivelling arm (2) capable of being moved by a hydraulic cylinder (4) around an axis (3) is mounted on a waste collecting vehicle (1). The swivelling arm (2) carries a lifting device (5) which in turn forms the base for a weighing device (6). The weighing device (6) is loaded by a weighing frame (7) having a lifting head (9) which is moved under the edge of a waste bin (8) to be emptied. The waste bin (8) is held at the bottom by a stop (10). Once the waste bin (8) is hooked on the lifting head (9), a holding edge (11) is moved over the edge of the waste bin (8) and is locked in this position by a locking device (12). The lifting head (9) is supported by two stays (14) between which a reading device (13) is arranged for giving identification characteristics of the waste bin (8) and for writing data in a memory arranged on the waste bin (8).
