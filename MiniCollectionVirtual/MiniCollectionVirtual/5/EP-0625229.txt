Built-in sink unit with at least one basin, comprising 
first surface areas, such as the bottom of the basin, 

subject to severe wear during use, and second surface 
areas, such as the side walls of the basin, subject to 

less severe wear during use, the first surface areas 
being provided with a three-dimensional surface structure 

and the second surface areas being smooth, characterized 
in that the surface structure of the first areas (12, 26, 

22a, 32a, 34a, 36a) is formed by microgrooves (100) 
which are at least approximately straight and extend at 

least approximately parallel to one another, the surface 
roughness measured transversely to the longitudinal 

direction of the microgrooves being greater than 0.1 µm 
and at the most 0.4 µm. 
Built-in sink unit as defined in claim 1, characterized 
in that the surface roughness measured transversely to 

the longitudinal direction of the microgrooves is 0.2 µm. 
Built-in sink unit as defined in claim 1 or 2,
 
characterized in that the surface roughness measured in 

the microgroove bottom in the longitudinal direction of 
the microgrooves is 0.1 µm.  

 
Built-in sink unit as defined in claim 1, characterized 
in
 that the ratio of the surface roughness measured 
transversely to the longitudinal direction of the 

microgrooves to the surface roughness measured in the 
microgroove bottom in the longitudinal direction of the 

microgrooves is between 1.2 and 2. 
Built-in sink unit as defined in any one or several of 
the preceding claims, characterized in that it consists 

of casting resin, in particular, incorporating filler 
material. 
Built-in sink unit as defined in any one or several of 
the preceding claims, characterized in that the first 

surface areas comprise one or more, preferably all of the 
following surface areas: 


(a) bottom (12) of the sink basin (10); 
(b) bottom (26) of a scraps basin (24); 
(c) upper side (22a) of ribs (22) of a draining surface 
(20); 
(d) upper side (32a or 34a) of one or several bases 
(32, 34) for tap fittings; 
(e) upper side (36a) of a raised rim (36) extending 
around the built-in sink unit (10). 
Built-in sink unit as defined in any one or several of 
the preceding claims, characterized in that the 

microgrooves (100) extend in the longitudinal direction 
of the sink unit. 
Mould for producing a built-in sink unit as defined in 
any one or several of claims 1 to 7, comprising a mould 

cavity corresponding to the built-in sink unit to be 
produced, characterized in that the wall of the mould 

cavity is ground in first wall surface areas 
corresponding to the first surface areas (12, 26, 22a, 

32a, 34a, 36a) of the built-in sink unit such that these 
first wall surface areas comprise ground microgrooves 

which are approximately straight and extend parallel to 
one another and are designed such that the first surface 

areas (12, 26, 22a, 32a, 34a, 36a) of a built-in sink 
unit produced with the mould have a surface roughness as 

defined in any one or several of claims 1 to 4.
