<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for providing pieces of 
flexible material from a length thereof (such as tubes 30 

from plastics tubing 4) has a rotor 6 with a port 9 
through which the tubing 4 is fed. Rotation of the rotor 

about its axis 7 displaces an end 4' of the tubing over a 
cutter 15 to cut the tube piece. The tube piece 30 may 

be gripped by jaws 23 on a turret 20 and carried to a 
transfer station 31 at which the tube piece 30 may be 

picked up by jaws 71 on a vertically displaceable head 60 
of a locating unit 3. The head 60 rotates with a turret 

56 and is displaced vertically under cam control 62, 63 
for fitting an end 30A of the tube piece into a component, 

such as an open topped container 40, in a seat 52 beneath 
the head 60. the container 40 may be conveyed to the 

seat 52 in a filling and sealing line for forming a 
beverage package.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus 
for providing pieces of flexible material from a length 
thereof. The invention was primarily developed for use 
with plastics material such as small-bore tubing supplied 
as relatively long or continuous lengths, typically from 
supply reels, from which predetermined length pieces are 
cut for subsequent use. It will be appreciated however 
that the invention is not intended to be restricted to 
such use and may, with advantage, be applied to materials 
other than plastics tubing, for example cable or wire. Modern production techniques frequently call for a high 
rate of throughput for articles and commodities. This is 
particularly so for beverage packages such as cans or 
other containers for alcoholic or non-alcoholic beverages 
where a filling line may be expected to run at a rate, for 
example, in excess of 500 containers per minute. In our 
development of beverage packages there is a requirement 
for a piece of plastics tube of predetermined length to be 
supplied and form a part of each package. The 
tube is required to be fitted 
to a hollow plastics insert within an open-topped 
container to extend upwardly within the container so that 
when the container is charged with beverage containing gas 
in solution and sealed under pressure, subsequent opening 
of the container develops a pressure differential between 
pressure in the hollow insert and pressure in the head 
space of the container causing gas and/or liquid to be  
 
expelled from the insert through the upstanding tube for 
the development of froth in the head space. U.S. Patent A-3,888,151 is believed to be the most 
relevant prior art and its disclosure forms the basis for 
the preamble to the characterizing clauses of the 
independent claims to the present invention. In 
particular in this prior disclosure the track part through 
which the length of material is fed or displaced 
longitudinally to the guide of the rotor for cutting by 
the cutter is in the form of an upstanding retaining tube 
which rotates with the rotor and is co-axial with the 
guide. The retaining tube accommodates a stock length of 
the material which falls under gravity through the tube to 
present a bottom end part length which is cut off during 
rotation of the rotor with the tube so that successive 
stock lengths of the material may have to be inserted into 
the tube at frequent intervals when cutting at high rates. 
In the 
production of the aforementioned packages we have 
determined that the most
