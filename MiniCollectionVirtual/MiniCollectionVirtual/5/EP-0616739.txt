<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the general group of doubly 
salient reluctance machines (DSRMs), including switched 
reluctance machines (SRMs), also known as variable reluctance 
machines, stepping motors and hybrid stepping motors producing 
linear or rotary motion. Doubly salient reluctance motors have received increasing 
attention over the past few years, with a large number of 
publications reviewing their relevant merits with regard to other 
machine types. The DSRM has been shown to produce a high 
specific output, despite rather poor utilisation of both the 
electrical and magnetic circuits, because of the introduction of 
a magnetic gearing ratio, which arises from the doubly salient 
nature of the geometry. The magnetic circuit of the machine is 
poorly utilised because each stator tooth can only be excited to 
produce positive torque for half of each rotation cycle. It is to be understood that the term 'saliency', when applied 
to reluctance machines, implies magnetic saliency, which may or 
may not involve actual physical saliency. A doubly salient reluctance machine has a stator and a rotor, 
both of which exhibit saliency. Magnetic saliency is used here 
as generally understood in the art, that is, a component of a 
reluctance machine (either its stator or rotor) is said to be 
salient if, in operation, changes in the reluctance of the 
magnetic circuit of the machine occur due to the construction of 
that component as the relative position of the rotor and the 
stator changes during operation of the machine. For example a conventional switched reluctance stepping motor 
is doubly salient since when a winding is energised and the rotor 
rotates towards a new position, the main portion of the 
cross-sectional areas of the active magnetic path in the both 
rotor and the stator increase and the reluctance of the magnetic  
 
circuit decreases due to the construction of both rotor and 
stator. In operation, energising different windings selects 
different active magnetic circuits but the topography of a 
selected circuit varies as the rotor rotates. A fuller description of switched reluctance motors and their 
principles and applications can be found in the IEEE Industry 
Applications Society Tutorial Course Publication "Switched 
Reluctance Drives" by J.M. Stephenson, S.R. MacMinn and 
J.R. Hendershot, Jr., as presented on October 12, 1990 at the 
IEEE IAS Conference in Seattle, Washington. The book "Stepping

A reluctance machine (10) comprising a stator and a rotor, each 
constructed to cause changes in the reluctance of the magnetic 

circuit as the relative position of the rotor and the stator 
changes during operation of the machine the stator carrying 

conductors (20,21;102) arranged and terminated to allow currents to flow 
around a plurality of loops each of which has at least a pair of 

portions in which current flows in opposite directions with 
respect to that direction which is normal to the direction of 

movement of the rotor to form magnetic poles, characterised in that, for 
each loop, each portion carrying current in one direction is 

separated from each portion carrying current in the opposite 
direction by a peripheral distance equal to that separating 

adjacent magnetic poles of opposite sign. 
A machine according to claim 1 wherein the conductors (20,21;102) are 
connected to form stator windings, each of which comprises a 

group of said loops and forms a current path such that, in 
operation, substantial torque developed by the machine is due to 

change in mutual inductance between the paths as the rotor 
rotates. 
A machine according to claim 1 or 2 wherein said conductors 
are arranged and terminated to allow unidirectional currents only. 
A machine according to any preceding claim, wherein as a 
consequence of the construction of the stator and the rotor each 

have a number of salient poles, the number of stator poles (S

other than an integer multiple of the number of rotor poles (R

A machine according to any preceding claim in which the 
conductors are located in stator slots and each slot contains 

conductors from a single winding only. 
A machine according to claim 1 or claims 4 or 5 insofar as 
dependent on claim 1 wherein the rotor comprises a permanent 

magnet (108) polarised in an axial direction and is so arranged that 
for every one of a plurality of rotor positions there is a 

respective preferential flux path between the rotor and the 
stator poles.  

 
A machine according to claim 6 wherein the rotor comprises 
two generally circular low-reluctance members (109,110) arranged on the 

rotor axis one at each end of the permanent magnet, each said 
member having a plurality of teeth (121) equally spaced around its 

circumference, any the stator comprises a plurality of saliently 
shaped poles (P1-P8) each carrying a plurality of teeth (120) adjacent to the 

rotor. 
A machine according to claim 7 comprising two windings, eight 
stator poles and fifty rotor teeth. 
A machine according to any of claims 1 to 5 comprising three 
windings, six stator poles and four rotor poles, or any integer 

multiple of these numbers. 
A machine according to any preceding claim in combination 
with means (11,12) for supplying multi-phase currents to the conductors. 
A combination according to claim 10 wherein, in operation, 
currents are supplied to the windings in a sequence which 

produces a net unidirectional torque on the rotor.
