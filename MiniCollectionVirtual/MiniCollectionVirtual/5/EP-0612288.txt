<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to removable caps for writing implements, 
and relates in particular, to a vented removable cap adapted to allow for the flow of 
air therethrough while engaging the nib or writing portion of the implement to prevent 
the evaporation of ink therefrom. Removable caps for writing implements which use ink are configured to 
enclose the writing or nib portion of the implement to prevent the evaporation of the 
ink therein as well as to protect the functional components. A conventional 
removable cap typically includes an outer cylindrical member having an inner cap 
disposed in the interior of the cylindrical member for receiving and forming an air 
tight seal around the writing portion of the implement. In one known type, the 
removable cap has a double walled construction closed at a first end and open at a  
 
second end, where the inner cap and the outer cylindrical member are integrally 
formed as a single unit. Recently, it has become desirable to construct a removable cap which 
not only provides an adequate seal around the writing portion of an implement, but 
also permits air to flow axially through the interior of the cap when the cap is 
detached from the implement. Such removable caps typically include an outer hollow 
main body, an inner cap disposed within and secured to the main body, and 
interconnected apertures and/or spaces to establish the air passage. Examples of such 
configurations are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,000,603 to Isoda, 5,000,604 to 
Isoda, GB 2220199, and PCT Application WO 89/11978. In U.S. Patent No. 5,000,603 to Isoda, a removable cap includes an 
inner cylinder positioned within an outer cylindrical body. A plurality of ribs are 
provided on the outer peripheral surface of the inner cylinder to secure the inner 
cylinder to the outer body along its mid-length, and an outer flange is provided at the 
open end of the inner cylinder to secure the inner cylinder to the outer cylindrical 
body at its bottom portion also. A complex air passageway arrangement provides 
communication between the inner cavity and the external atmosphere. U.S. Patent No. 5,000,604 to Isoda discloses an inner cylinder for 
covering the tip of the writing instrument secured to a double-walled outer cylinder. 
The inner wall of the double-walled outer cylinder is provided with a plurality of 
axially directed slits, and the axially directed land portions between the slits are 
secured to the inner cylinder. Communication between the inner cavity and the 
external
