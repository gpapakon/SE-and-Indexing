alloy coating on a substrate is described. The plating bath generally comprise 


(A) zinc ions; 
(B) nickel ions; and 
(C) at least one heterocyclic compound having the general formula


RN⁺-R¹-Y

wherein RN is an aromatic heterocyclic nitrogen-containing group, R¹ is an alkylene 

or hydroxy alkylene group, Y is -OSO₃, -SO₃, -COOH, -CONH₂ or -OH, X is a 
halide, a and b = 0 or 1, and the sum of 


a + b = 1

Preferably, additional additives are included in the plating bath to improve the 

properties of the deposited alloy. For example, polymers of aliphatic amines may be 
included to improve the level of the deposits and metal complexing agents such as 

hydroxyalkyl-substituted polyamines also may be included. The plating baths of the 
invention are effective depositing bright alloys over a wide current density range.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to aqueous alkaline plating baths and to the 
electrodeposition of a bright zinc-nickel alloy from such baths. More particularly, 
the invention relates to alkaline zinc-nickel alloy plating baths containing certain 
aromatic heterocyclic nitrogen-containing compounds. Considerable research has been devoted over the years to provide 
improved corrosion protection to metallic surfaces. One way of providing this 
corrosion protection is by electrodepositing a zinc coating on the surface. For 
decades, electroplated zinc has been used by the automotive industry to provide an 
economical, highly corrosion-resistant coating. However, with continued demands 
for higher quality and extended warranties, both the automotive manufacturers and 
their suppliers have had to develop new coatings. The best overall performance is 
being demonstrated by zinc-cobalt and zinc-nickel alloy platings. These alloys are 
being used as replacements for conventional zinc electroplates in automotive as well 
as other applications requiring extended corrosion-resistance. The term "alloy," as 
used in this specification and claims is defined as a mixture of two or more metallic 
elements which may be microscopically homogeneous or microscopically heterogeneous.  
 The improvement of zinc-nickel alloys has been demonstrated by 
superior salt spray performance when comparing zinc-nickel to zinc electrodeposits. 
The amount of nickel in the zinc-nickel electrodeposit that is useful for improved 
corrosion protection has been found to be from about 4% to about 18% nickel with 
an optimum level of about 10% to 12%. Typically, acid zinc-nickel alloy plating baths have been based on 
inorganic zinc and nickel salts such as zinc sulfate, zinc chloride, nickel sulfate or 
nickel chloride, and the baths contain various additives to improve the brightness and 
the grain structure of the deposit and provide control of the zinc to nickel ratio. US-A-2,876,177 describes nickel electroplating 
baths containing internal salts of quaternary ammonium-N-alkyl sulfonic acids 
wherein the electroplating baths are Watts-type acid nickel electroplating baths. Acid 
zinc-nickel alloy plating baths generally contain an acid such as boric acid or sulfuric 
acid and other additives such as brightening agents, wetting agents, etc. US-A-3,862,019 
describes an aqueous acid electroplating bath which 
contains nickel salts and as brightening agents, the synergistic combination of N-(3-sulfopropyl) 
pyridinium inner salt and an acetylenic
