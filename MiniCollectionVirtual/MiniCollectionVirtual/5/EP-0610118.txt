<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the designing, testing and manufacture of fuels for diesel engines. According to the invention, automatic measurement is carried out of the cetane index of a fuel for supplying a diesel engine, starting with the value of the cetane index of at least one reference fuel and using values respectively measured of the self-ignition delays of the reference fuel and of the supply fuel. The diesel engine runs at a constant speed and with constant volumetric compression ratio. The invention finds its application in laboratories for testing and research as well as in units for manufacturing fuels for diesel engines, in crude oil processing plants.
