<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is a silicone pressure-sensitive
adhesive which comprises a resin component, a
polymer component having alkenyl groups in its molecule, a
silicon hydride-functional crosslinking agent and a
catalyst, characterized by a molar ratio of SiH groups of
said crosslinking agent to alkenyl groups of said polymer
being within the range of 0.1 to <1.0.Silicone pressure-sensitive adhesives (hereinafter
PSAs) typically contain at least two primary components,
namely a linear siloxane polymer and an MQ resin comprising
triorganosiloxane (M) units (i.e., R3SiO1/2 units, in which
R denotes a monovalent organic group) and silicate (Q) units
(i.e., SiO4/2 units). In addition, silicone PSA
compositions are generally provided with some crosslinking
means in order to optimize various properties of the final
adhesive product. Typically, in view of the high viscosity
imparted by the polymer component, these PSA compositions
are usually dispersed in an organic solvent for ease of
application.When silicone PSA compositions employ an alkenyl-functional
polymer and a crosslinking agent containing
silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms, they are cured by a
hydrosilation addition reaction using a platinum-type
catalyst. In such systems, the molar ratio of silicon
bonded hydrogen groups to silicon-bonded alkenyl groups is
typically greater than 1, as exemplified by US-A 4,988,779.
Although many of these PSAs have good adhesive properties,
they often lack a balance between aggressive adhesion to
substrates, such as metal and high initial tack. A major 
drawback of the art is that they tend to fail in a cohesive
mode when peeled from a substrate, particularly when the
peel rate is high. This has the untoward effect of
transferring some of the adhesive to the substrate from
which it is peeled (i.e., small "islands" of PSA remain on
the substrate after the PSA is delaminated). This is
undesirable in many commercial applications (e.g., PSA
residues left on components in electronic masking
applications). EP-A-0 506 370 discloses a solventless or high solids-containing
organopolysiloxane composition curable to produce a
pressure-sensitive adhesive having high tack and high
peeladhesion, comprising (A) a toluene soluble, resinous copolymer
comprising R3SiO1/2 units; (B) an alkylen-terminated
polydiorganosiloxane having a viscosity of from about 10 to
about 500 centipoise at 25 °C; (C) from 0 to about 90 mole %
of a hydride-terminated organohydrogenpolysiloxane having a
viscosity of from about 10 to about 1000 centipoise at 25
°
