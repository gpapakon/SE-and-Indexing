<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for measuring fast neutron induced gamma 
ray energy spectra in cased wellbores (10) has an electronic 

source (28) of monoenergetic fast neutrons, a high density 
scintillation detector (27), a downhole pulse height 

analyzer (26), a gain control means (25) and a timing means 
(23). The gain stabilization utilizes the iron (Fe) edge in 

the capture gamma ray spectrum to establish system gain 
since iron is always present in the tool case and the 

wellbore casing.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus
for measuring gamma ray spectra in cased borehole.Proposals to use induced gamma ray spectroscopy
for detecting the carbon/oxygen ratio in a well borehole
date back several decades. Commercial operations in this
field began in the mid-1970's. The primary applications
today remain the cased hole determination of oil saturation
in reservoirs of low or unknown water salinity. Recent
efforts have expanded the use of the technique to
geochemical analysis in open hole. Unfortunately, the
intrinsic dynamic range of the carbon/oxygen ratio
measurement is small. This requires very high statistical
precision for reasonable oil saturation uncertainty. Until
recently, the technique has been very slow and often
required stationary measurements. This was in part because
of the small intrinsic dynamic range of the carbon oxygen
ratio, but also because the detectors used in well logging
instruments had significant limitations.Over the past decade or so, several new high
density scintillators have become available which can
provide improved gamma ray detection capability. Newer
carbon/oxygen and geochemical logging tools can use these
new high density scintillators. One of these materials is
bismuth germanate (BGO). The merit of the high density 
scintillator relative to conventional sodium iodide detectors (previously used in
induced gamma ray spectrometers) is that it provides substantially better
detection efficiency. That is, a larger fraction of the total gamma ray flux is in the
full energy or first escape peak. Less gamma ray energy is disposed in the
structureless Compton scattered low energy tail, in the more dense bismuth
germanate detectors relative to sodium iodide.In US-A-4766543 there is disclosed a generalized computer-based
system and method for acquisition of nuclear well logging data, including
downhole generation of energy and time spectral information. A downhole
instrument traverses a borehole introducing high energy neutrons into the
formation at prescribed depths. Resultant gamma rays are detected and
converted into pulses which are amplified and conditioned.A downhole multi-parameter analyzer stores pulse height and
arrival time for each detected gamma ray whereby time and energy spectra are
formed. Spectra include, alone or in combination, time spectra of the neutron
source, inelastic and capture energy spectra. From the source time spectra,
peaks are detected and capture and inelastic gates referenced thereto. Also
thermal neutron decay between source
