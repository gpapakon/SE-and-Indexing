<ABSTRACT>
An article of protective headgear has a 
coating of a reflective material. The article includes 

an impact resistant shell 14 of a substantially 
transparent material. A layer 20 of a light dispersing 

material 22 is applied to an inner surface 19 of the 
shell 14. A layer 24 of reflective material 26 is 

applied to the layer 20 of light dispersing material 22. 
The invention extends to a method of manufacturing an 

article of protective headgear.

<DESCRIPTION>
THIS INVENTION relates to an article of headgear. More 
particularly, the invention relates to an article of protective 
headgear and to a method of manufacturing an article of 
protective headgear. It is known to provide safety helmets having a reflective 
coating arranged on an outer surface of a protective shell. US-A-3885246 
discloses a protective helmet having a reflective 
layer over an outer surface of a protective shell of the helmet. 
A transparent sheet is located over the reflective coating to 
protect the reflective layer. US-A-4993082 discloses a helmet having a moulded cover 
shell for decorating and protecting the exterior surface of a 
helmet body. A thin clear plastic sheet of material is moulded 
in the shape of the upper exterior portion of the helmet body 
and painted or colaminated on the interior surface of the cover 
prior to fitting of the cover to the helmet's body. It is an object of this invention to use the strength of a 
shell of a helmet to protect a reflective layer arranged on the 
helmet. It is also an object of this invention to provide a 
method of manufacturing a reflective helmet which is simple and 
cost-effective. According to a first aspect of the invention, there is 
provided a method of manufacturing an article of protective 
headgear, the method including the steps of: providing an 
impact-resistant shell, applying a layer of light-dispersing 
material to the shell and applying a layer of reflective 
material to the shell, the method being characterised in that : 
the shell is of a substantially transparent material; the layer of light-dispersing material is applied to an 
inner surface of the shell; and the layer of reflective material is applied to the layer 
of light-dispersing material. The method may include the further step of applying a 
layer of sealing material to the layer of reflective material to 
inhibit damage to the reflective material.  
 The method may further include forming the 
light dispersing material by dispersing glass beads in 
a resin. The resin may be a waterless resin. A solvent, a flow agent and acrylic beads may 
be mixed together to form the resin, so that the resin 
is in a sprayable form. A suspension agent may be added 
to the resin to suspend the glass beads within the resin 
so that, on application, the glass beads are 
substantially evenly dispersed in the layer of light 
dispersing material. The reflective material may be dissolved in a 
suitable solvent to form a liquid solution of the 
reflective material. The method may

A method of manufacturing an article of protective 
headgear (10), the method including the steps of: 


providing an impact-resistant shell; 
applying a layer (20) of a light-dispersing material 
(22) to the shell; and 
applying a layer (24) of reflective material (26) to 
the shell;
 
   characterized in that :- 


the shell (14) is of a substantially transparent 
material; 
the layer (20) of light-dispersing material (22) is 
applied to an inner surface (19) of the shell (14); and 
the layer (24) of reflective material (26) is applied 
to the layer (20) of light-dispersing material (22). 
The method as claimed in claim 1 which includes 
the step of applying a layer (28) of sealing material (30) 

to the layer (24) of reflective material (26) to inhibit 
damage to the reflective material (26). 
The method as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 which 
includes forming the light-dispersing material (22) by 

dispersing glass beads (32) in a resin (30), preferably a 
waterless resin. 
The method as claimed in claim 3, which includes 
the step of mixing a solvent, a flow agent and acrylic 

beads together to form the resin (30), so that the resin 
(30) is in a sprayable form. 
The method as claimed in claim 4, which includes 
adding a suspension agent to the resin (30) to suspend the 

glass beads (32) within the resin (30) so that, on 
application, the glass beads (32) are substantially evenly 

dispersed in the layer (20) of light-dispersing material.  
 
The method as claimed in any one of claims 2 to 5, 
which includes dissolving the reflective material (18) in a 

suitable solvent to form a liquid solution of the 
reflective material (18). 
The method as claimed in claim 6, which includes 
the step of dissolving a reflective metal in said solvent. 
The method as claimed in claim 6 or claim 7, which 
includes the step of spraying the light-dispersing material 

(22) onto said shell (14), and optionally spraying the 
solution of reflective material (18) onto the layer (20) of 

light dispersing material (22). 
The method as claimed in claim 8 which includes 
the step of spraying the resin (30) onto the layer (24) of 

reflective material (18) to form the layer (28) of sealing 
material (30). 
The method as claimed in any one of claims 2 to 
9, inclusive, which includes applying the layers of light-dispersing 

material (22), reflective material (18) and 
sealing material (30) to substantially the entire inner 

surface (19) of the shell (14).

the impact resistant shell (14) is of a substantially 
transparent material (16); and 
the layer (20) of the light dispersing material (22) 
is applied to an inner surface (19) of the shell (14). 
The article as claimed in claim 12 which includes 
a layer (28) of a sealing material (30) applied to the 

layer (20) of reflective material (18) to inhibit damage to 
the layer (20) of reflective material (18).
