<ABSTRACT>
There are disclosed certain novel compounds identified as benzo-fused lactams which promote the release of growth hormone in humans and animals. This property can be utilized to promote the growth of food animals to render the production of edible meat products more efficient, and in humans, to increase the stature of those afflicted with a lack of a normal secretion of natural growth hormone. Growth promoting compositions containing such benzo-fused lactams as the active ingredient thereof are also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
Growth hormone, which is secreted from the pituitary,
stimulates growth of all tissues of the body that are capable of growing.
In addition, growth hormone is known to have the following basic
effects on the metabolic process of the body:
1. Increased rate of protein synthesis in all cells of the body;2. Decreased rate of carbohydrate utilization in cells of the
body;3. Increased mobilization of free fatty acids and use of fatty
acids for energy.A deficiency in growth hormone secretion can result in
various medical disorders, such as dwarfism.Various ways are known to release growth hormone. For
example, chemicals such as arginine, L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine
(L-DOPA), glucagon, vasopressin, and insulin induced hypoglycemia, as
well as activities such as sleep and exercise, indirectly cause growth
hormone to be released from the pituitary by acting in some fashion on
the hypothalamus perhaps either to decrease somatostatin secretion or to
increase the secretion of the known secretagogue growth hormone
releasing factor (GRF) or an unknown endogenous growth hormone-releasing
hormone or all of these.In cases where increased levels of growth hormone were
desired, the problem was generally solved by providing exogenous
growth hormone or by administering an agent which stimulated growth
hormone production and/or release. In either case the peptidyl nature
of the compound necessitated that it be administered by injection.
Initially the source of growth hormone was the extraction of the
pituitary glands of cadavers. This resulted in a very expensive product
and carried with it the risk that a disease associated with the source of
the pituitary gland could be transmitted to the recipient of the growth 
hormone. Recently, recombinant growth hormone has become available
which, while no longer carrying any risk of disease transmission, is still
a very expensive product which must be given by injection or by a nasal
spray.Other compounds have been developed which stimulate the
release of endogenous growth hormone such as analogous peptidyl
compounds related to GRF or the peptides of U.S. Patent 4,411,890.
These peptides, while considerably smaller than growth hormones are
still susceptible to various proteases. As with most peptides, their
potential for oral bioavailability is low. The instant compounds are
non-peptidyl agents for promoting the release of growth hormone
which may be administered parenterally, nasally or by the oral route.European Patent Publication No. 0 513 974-A is an intervening
