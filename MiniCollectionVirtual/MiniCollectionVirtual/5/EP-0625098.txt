 TRANSFER UNIT FOR PRINTING SYSTEMSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the InventionThe present invention relates to printing systems and, more particularly, to an apparatus for transferring a thin layer of material onto indicia that are printed, copied or otherwise affixed onto the surfaces of sheet-like articles.2. Description of the Prior ArtThe process of applying coatings to printed indicia for the purpose of coloring, decorating, texturizing or otherwise highlighting the indicia is known in the field of printing. One general class of methods commonly used for highlighting such indicia employs a special transfer sheet that includes a transferrable layer of the decorative material and a means, called a transfer unit, to selectively transfer the material onto the indicia. The transfer sheet is usually brought into contact with the indicia while the transfer unit applies heat and pressure, causing the transferrable layer to adhere to the indicia as the layer is released from the transfer sheet. The transferrable layer may be a decorative metallic foil, such as gold or silver as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,868,049, or it may be a plastic foil, such as mylar or the like. Detailed descriptions of such prior art methods and devices may be found in the following U.S. Patents: No. 4,724,026; No. 3,519,512; No. 4,866,539; and No. 4,760,467.The '026 patent is directed to a process for transferring metallic foil onto a xerographic image. The •512 patent discloses a machine that applies heat and pressure to a transfer sheet for applying designed indicia to articles of various shapes. The '539 and '467 patents disclose computerized foil systems that include a transfer unit mounted at the output of a paper copier or printer. 

 The '049 patent discloses a transfer foil sheet which may¬ be used in the process described in the '026 patent. The transfer units in the '539 and '467 patents include a plurality of rollers that automatically superimpose foil onto indicia-carrying paper. Heat and pressure are applied to the foil by means of a heated solenoid-activated roller to cause the foil to transfer onto the indicia. The foil and material onto which it is transferred are transported through the transfer unit by the interaction of a system of gears.Although such prior-art printing systems and methods have served the purpose, they have not proved entirely satisfactory under all conditions of service for the reasons that considerable difficulty is often experienced in obtaining a high-quality product in printing

<CLAIMS>
What Is Claimed Is:
1. A foil transfer unit for transferring foil onto a substrate comprising: a frame; a foil supply means mounted on said frame for holding a transfer sheet; a heater roller means mounted on said frame; a pressure roller means; a lever means, supporting said pressure roller means, for moving said pressure roller means between an active position where said pressure roller means presses against said heater roller and a ready position where said pressure roller means is spaced from said heater roller means; a foil take-up means including drive means for moving said transfer sheet from said foil supply means, between said heater roller and said pressure roller and onto said take-up means; resilient means for biasing said lever means; arm means having a slot therein, said arm means being slidably coupled said lever means; and drive means for rotating said arm means so that said slot slidably moves along said lever means permitting said resilient means to move said lever in an upward direction for moving said pressure roller means between said ready position and said active position.
2. The unit of claim 1 further comprising: an axle coupled to said drive means; and 


 a block coupled to said axle and said arm means, wherein said drive means rotates said axle, thereby rotating said block in a clockwise direction for moving said lever into said active position and rotating said block in a counter-clockwise direction for moving said lever into said ready position.
3. The unit of claim 2 wherein said lever means is coupled dead center in said slot when said units is in said active position.
4. The unit of claim 3 wherein said lever means moves from said dead center in said slot to an end of said slot which said unit is in said ready position.
5. The unit of claim 1 further including brake means controlled by said lever means for preventing movement of said foil supply means when said pressure roller is in said ready position.
6. The unit of claim 5 further including torque adjustment means for adjusting the torque imparted to said heater roller means, said supply roller means and said take-up roller means.
7. The unit of claim 6 further including detector means for detecting whether said unit is in said active position or said ready position. 


 8. The unit of claim 7 further including substrate input sensing means which activates said unit when said substrate enters said unit.
9. The unit of claim 8 further including guide means for guiding said substrate between said heater roller means and said pressure roller means.
10. The unit of claim 9 wherein said substrate input sensing means is carried by guide means.
11. The unit of claim 10 further including foil detecting means for detecting the presence of said foil on said foil supply means.
12. The unit of claim 11 further including driven removal means for removing said substrate from said unit after said foil has been transferred onto said substrate.
13. The unit of claim 12 further comprising additional torque adjustment means for adjusting the torque imparted to said driven removal means.
14. The unit of claim 13 further including coupling means for coupling said unit to the output of a printing means.
15. The unit of claim 14 further comprising a heater roller overheating prevention means for monitoring the 


 temperature of said heater roller means and reducing said temperature if said heater roller means remains at a predetermined elevated temperature for a predetermined period of time.
16. The unit of claim 15 wherein said foil supply means includes a foil roll spindle means for mounting a roll of foil and said foil detecting means includes a timing wheel having index markings on the rim thereof and a photoelectric means for detecting said index markings, wherein when said photoelectric means ceases to detect the movement of said index markings, said foil detecting means produces a signal indicating that said unit has run out of foil.
17. The unit of claim 16 wherein said substrate input sensing means comprises: a light beam source; a light beam detecting means; and, a pivotable arm suspended in a pendulum-like manner in the path of said substrate as it enters said unit, wherein the entry of said substrate into said unit causes said arm to pivot into the path of said light beam thereby causing said light beam detecting means to signal the presence of said substrate entering said unit.
18. The unit of claim 17 wherein said guide means include a spring loaded pivotable guide bracket for guiding said substrate as it travels through said unit. 


 19. The unit of claim 5 wherein said brake means comprises a band attached to said lever means for selectively applying stopping friction to said foil supply means.
20. The unit of claim 5 wherein said brake means comprises a brake shoe attached to said lever means for selectively applying stopping friction to said foil supply means.
