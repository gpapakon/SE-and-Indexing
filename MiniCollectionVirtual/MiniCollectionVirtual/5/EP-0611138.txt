<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for manufacturing a thin amorphous 
metal strip. Molten metal is injected onto a single cooling roll 

rotating at high speed. A gas flow impeding wall is disposed 
adjacent to the surface of a cooling roll and extends across the 

body of the cooling roll. The wall is located upstream of the 
molten metal injection nozzle. CO₂ gas is jetted along one surface 

of the gas insulating wall which faces the molten metal injection 
nozzle and toward the surface of the cooling roll. An atmosphere 

rich in CO₂ gas is maintained adjacent the roll surface just 
upstream of the molten metal injection nozzle.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to technology for manufacturing 
a thin amorphous metal strip which is thicker than about 35 µm and 
which is adaptable to manufacturing a thin metal strip with rapid 
cooling using a single roll. A method of manufacturing a thin metal strip directly from 
molten metal has been known, the method being arranged in such a 
manner that the molten metal is dripped through a nozzle onto the 
outer surface of a cooling roll which is rotating at high speed. 
The foregoing method using the cooling roll is classified as either 
the "single roll method" or the "twin roll method." The single roll method is suitable for manufacturing 
relatively wide thin metal strips. It is performed by injecting 
molten metal through a nozzle toward a single cooling roll which is 
rotating at high speed. The molten metal is rolled out thinly 
while being allowed to adhere to the surface of the cooling roll 
and it is rapidly cooled and solidified during rotation through a 
certain angular distance so that it is formed into amorphous metal 
on the roll surface. The amorphous metal is separated from the 
surface of the cooling roll by the centrifugal force generated when 
the cooling roll rotates so that the amorphous metal is formed into 
a thin strip. When the thin amorphous metal strip is cast into the 
atmosphere rotation of the cooling roll generates a phenomenon 
wherein an air boundary layer is formed in an air layer that is in 
contact with the surface of the cooling roll. The air boundary 
layer is fluidized because it is being dragged by the surface of 
the cooling roll. The air in the air boundary layer is introduced 
into the space between the molten metal injected onto the cooling 
roll and the surface of the cooling roll. Such introduced air 
excessively increases the heat transfer resistance of the surface 
of the cooling roll, decreasing its cooling ability. Accordingly,  
 
it has been difficult to cast an amorphous thin strip thicker than 
35 µm using this technique. Referring to the drawings, particularly Fig. 11 which shows a 
conventional single roll apparatus, when a cooling roll 2 is 
rotated in the direction designated by the arrow 6, an air boundary 
layer 3 is formed adjacent to the surface of the cooling roll 2. 
Air in the boundary layer 3 is introduced into the space between 
the molten metal 4 injected through the nozzle 1 and the surface of 
the cooling roll 2, so that a layer of introduced air 5 is 
generated. The introduced air 5 moves downstream under the 
injected
