<ABSTRACT>
A surface transfer has a water-permeable paper substrate (10) with a release layer (12) and a barrier layer (14) thereon. A design layer (16) is ink-jet printed onto the barrier layer (14). The transfer is applied to a region of a surface to be decorated so that the design layer contacts the surface. An adhesive is used to secure the design layer (16) to the surface. Subsequently, the paper substrate (10) is dampened to soften the release layer (12) and is then peeled away to reveal the design layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DECALCOMANIAThis invention relates to a transfer specifically intended in use for transferring a design thereon to a surface such as a wall, ceiling, advertising hoarding, sign, vehicle panel, furniture or the like (hereinafter such a transfer will be referred to as a "surface transfer"), and also to a method of use of such a surface transfer.It is known to provide transfers for decorating articles, eg ceramic tableware, furniture and sports equipment, in which a design layer of the transfer is formed by a screen printing operation. However, such a screen printing operation is not particularly suitable for the production of "one-off" or short production runs of transfers.Fireable transfers for decorating ceramic articles have been proposed in EP-A-0657309, wherein the required pattern of the design layer is printed in a clear adhesive or adhesive precursor on release paper by an electronically controlled printing process, eg using an ink jet printer. Then, a ceramic decorative or functional material, e.g. ceramic pigment, in finely divided form is applied to the printed adhesive pattern so as to form the pattern in the material. However, such a procedure is quite complicated and expensive and is therefore not particularly suitable for use in the present invention.It has also been proposed (see "Xerox Engineering Systems ColorGrafx Image Transfer WearCoat" published by Xerox Engineering Systems, 15 November 1994) to form a transfer by mirror-image electrostatic printing of an image using a Xerox 8900 colour printer onto a multilayered medium comprising a base paper carrier and a clear wear-coat layer, the 

image being printed onto the latter. In order to effect transfer of the image onto a final substrate, e.g. an adhesive-backed vinyl, the printed paper is positioned on the final substrate and the assembly passed through a hot roll laminator. It is also indicated in this publication that cold roll lamination can also be used but a double-sided adhesive must be applied to the substrate before lamination. After lamination, the base paper carrier is peeled away to reveal the image through the clear wear- coat layer.It is an object of the present invention to enable the economic production of surface transfers on a one-off or short run basis.According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a surface transfer comprising a design layer removably carried on a backing, wherein the design layer is an ink jet printed layer.According to another aspect of the present invention, there is

CLAIMS
1. A surface transfer comprising a design layer removably carried on a backing, wherein the design layer is an ink jet printed layer.
2. A surface transfer according to claim 1 , wherein the ink in the ink-jet printed layer is a phase change ink.
3. A surface transfer according to claim 1 , wherein the ink in the ink-jet printed layer is a solvent-based pigment.
4. A surface transfer according to any preceding claim, wherein the backing comprises a water-permeable substrate.
5. A surface transfer according to claim 4, wherein the substrate has a thickness in the range of 60 to 200 μm.
6. A surface transfer according to claim 4, wherein the substrate has a thickness in the range of 90 to 120 μm.
7. A surface transfer according to any preceding claim, wherein a release layer formed of a water-releasable adhesive is provided over the backing.
8. A surface transfer according to claim 7, wherein a transparent barrier layer is provided between the release layer and the design layer.
9. A surface transfer according to claim 1 , 2 or 3, wherein the backing includes a substrate to which a stretchable film is removably 


secured by an adhesive layer, and wherein the stretchable film removably carries the design layer.
10. A method of decorating a surface, comprising the step of securing the design layer of a surface transfer according to any preceding claim to the surface.
