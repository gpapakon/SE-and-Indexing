<ABSTRACT>
In-containing III/V semiconductor materials (e.g., InGaP) can be dry 
etched in BCl
3
 in ECR apparatus. We have discovered that addition of N
2
 to the 
BCl
3
 can result in substantially higher etch rate (e.g., more than 50% higher). 
Etching is substantially without incubation period, and the resulting surface can be 

very smooth (e.g., RMS roughness less than 5 nm, even less than 2.5 nm). 
Exemplarily, the novel etching step is used in the manufacture of a InGaP/GaAs 

transistor.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to methods of making In-containing III/V
semiconductor devices, exemplarily semiconductor lasers and transistors.It is known that the In-containing III/V semiconductor heterostructure
systems (e.g., InGaP/GaAs, InGaAs/InP) can have advantages over the Al-containing
system (e.g., AlGaAs/GaAs). Among these advantages are lower susceptibility to
oxidation as well as an apparent lower density of deep level states. Thus there exists
a need for development of processing methods for In-containing III/V semiconductor
devices.The remainder of the discussion will be largely in terms of a particular
In-containing semiconductor material, namely, InGaP. This is done for reason of
conciseness and does not imply that the inventive method is thus limited.InGaP can be selectively wet etched in HCl-based solutions, and
selective dry etching of InGaP over GaAs is possible in CH4/H2 discharges.
However, not only is the etch rate of the prior art dry etching method very low
(typically <10 nm/min), but the method typically results in extensive hydrogen
passivation in exposed III/V material, requiring annealing to re-activate dopants.
Faster etch rates can be obtained with Cl-based plasmas, but at temperatures below
about 150°C the resulting surface generally is rough, and typically unsuitable for
further processing. Dry etching at higher temperatures may result in smoother
surfaces but is not desirable because of substantial incompatibility with other process
steps, and the limitation for using conventional resist masks.In view of the potential advantages of at least some In-containing III/V
semiconductor devices, it would be of considerable interest to have available a
method of dry etching In-containing III/V semiconductor material that can produce
smooth, substantially damage-free surfaces, can yield high etch rates substantially
without incubation period, and does not require high sample temperature. This
application discloses such a method.Dry etching of metals in BCl3-based plasmas is known. For instance,
B. J. Howard et al., J. VacuumScienceandTechnology, Vol. 12 (4), Part 1, p. 1259
(1994), report etching of Cu in BCl3/N2 as well as in BCl3/Ar. At 225-275°C the
Cu etch rate in the former plasma was found to be as much as an order of magnitude
larger than in the latter. They report that N2 does not merely act as a diluent but 
rather increases the concentration of Cl atoms.By way of further examples, W. F. Marx et al., J.VacuumScienceand
Technology, Vol. 10 (4), Part 1, p. 1232 (1992), report
