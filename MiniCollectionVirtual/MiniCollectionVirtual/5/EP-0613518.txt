<ABSTRACT>
A combined gas-steam turbine power station has a gas turbine installation (1) and a steam turbine (5) connected with a generator (24). The combustion gases from the gas turbine (1) are heated in an additional firing place (2) and then flow through at least two evaporators (3, 4), the first of which has an overheater. In addition, a closed steam circuit is provided, in which the evaporator (3) with the overheater followed by the steam turbine (5) is located, as well as a heater (6) for a double-circuit heater (8) preferably provided for heating a long-distance energy medium (7). The second heater (9) of the double-circuit heater (8) is arranged in a closed heat pump circuit (10) in which the second evaporator (4), a steam compressor (12) driven by a motor (11) and a valve (13) are located. The long-distance energy medium (7) flows at first through the heater (9) in the heat pump circuit (10), then through the heater in the steam circuit. Thanks to the heating of the long-distance energy medium by the steam circuit and heat pump, more than 80 % overall efficiency is achieved. In addition, the outlet temperature of the gas turbine combustion gases is very low (90 DEG ), so that their thermal utilization coefficient is very high.

Combined gas-steam turbine power station for the 
production of electrical energy, including a gas turbine station 

consisting of a compressor, a turbine and a generator on one 
shaft and a combustion chamber situated between the compressor 

and the turbine, and a steam turbine which is connected to a 
generator, characterized in that the combustion gasses of the 

gas turbine (1) are heated in an additional burner (2) and 
thereafter, before exiting, flow sequentially through at least 

two vapourizers (3,4) whereof the first one comprises an 
overheater, and in that a closed steam circuit is provided in 

which are situated the vapourizer (3) with the overheater which 
is followed by the steam turbine (5) and a heater (6) of a 

double circuit heater (8) which is provided preferably for the 
heating of a remote heating medium, and in that the second 

heater (9) of the double circuit heater (8) is arranged in a 
closed heat pump circuit (10) in which are situated the second 

vapourizer (4) a steam compressor (12) which is driven by a 
motor (11) and a valve (13), and in that the remote heating 

medium (7) flows first through the heater (9) in the heat pump 
circuit (10) and thereafter the one in the vapour circuit. 
The combined gas-steam turbine station of claim 1, 
characterized in that the combustion material (14) for 
the gas 
turbine (1) and for the additional burner (2) is preferably 

natural gas (14). 
The combined gas-steam turbine station of claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that a further vapourizer (15) is provided 

between the vapourizer (3) with the overheater and the 
vapourizer (4) in the heat pump circuit (10), through which 

vapourizer (15) flows the combustion gas, and which is provided 
in parallel to the vapourizer (3) with the overheater and the 

vapour turbine (5).  
 
The combined gas-steam turbine station of at least one 
of claims 1-3, characterized in that two feed pumps (16,17) are 

provided in the vapour circuit, one of which being situated 
after the heater (6) and one before the vapourizer (3) with the 

overheater. 
The combined gas-steam turbine station of at least one 
of claims 1-3, characterized in that a valve (18) is provided 

within the vapour circuit before the turbine (5).
