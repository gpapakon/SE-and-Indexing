<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a freezing apparatus (10) with a thermally insulated housing (11) which can be closed by a door (15) in whose interior (16), which is supplied with cold, there are arranged drawer-like frozen-food containers (23) which can be pulled out by handle elements (25), and at whose bottom (17) the melted water, resulting during a thawing process from evaporators serving to produce cold in the interior owing to the ice forming thereon, collects and is fed to an outlet, via which it flows into a frozen-food container (23) serving as collecting container, a channel (40) which can be moved up to the outlet and via which the melted water is supplied to the frozen-food container (23) is arranged on the frozen-food container (23).

<CLAIMS>
Freezer appliance (10) with a thermally insulating housing (11), 
which is closable by a door (15) and the interior space (16) of which 

is chargeable by coldness and has drawer-like frozen stock containers 
(23) arranged therein, which are extractable by handle elements (25), 

and at the base (17) of which the melt water collects, which by reason 
of the ice forming thereat results during a defrosting process of 

evaporators serving for the refrigeration in the interior space (16) 
and is led to an outlet (19), characterised thereby, that a chute (40), 

which is guidable to the outlet (19) and by way of which the melt water 
is fed to a frozen stock container (23) serving as collecting 

container, is arranged at that frozen stock container (23). 
Freezer appliance according to claim 1, characterised thereby, that 
the outlet is executed as stationary chute element (19) in the region 

of the door opening (12). 
Freezer appliance according to claim 2, characterised thereby, that 
the chute element (19) and the chute (40) are arranged one above the 

other during a defrosting process. 
Freezer appliance according to claim 1, characterised thereby, that 
the chute (40) arranged at the frozen stock container (23) is 

pivotable about a horizontal axle from a recessed position into its 
operative position, in which a part of the chute (40) is arranged 

within and a part externally of the container space, wherein both parts 
of the chute (40) are equipped with a wall (43) serving to guide the 

water. 
Freezer appliance according to claim 4, characterised thereby, that 
the horizontal axle is arranged eccentrically of the length of the 

chute (40), wherein the shorter part, that has arisen due to the 
position of the axle, of the chute (40) after its pivotation into the 

operative position projects through a passage (36) in the container 
wall into the container space, whilst the longer part is couplable to 

the chute element (19) at the opening rim of the door (15).  
 
Freezer appliance according to claim 4 or 5, characterised thereby, 
that the wall (23) serving to guide the water is executed to be higher 

at the shorter part of the chute (40) than at its longer part. 
Freezer appliance according to claim 4 or 5, characterised thereby, 
that the horizontal axle is arranged in a plane parallel to one of the 

container walls. 
Freezer appliance according to claim 4, 5 or 6, characterised 
thereby, that the bearing spigots (41), which are arranged at the chute 

(40) and each lie opposite the other in alignment and which are 
detachably connected with bearing shells (35) arranged at the container 

wall (27) lying opposite the handle element (25), serve as horizontal 
axle. 
Freezer appliance according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised thereby, that the chute (40) at the frozen stock 

container (23) is arranged in its rest position to be recessed in a 
receptacle (28) at the container wall (27) and closing the passage (36) 

arranged therein and in its recessed position is arrested at the 
container wall (27). 
Freezer appliance according to claim 2 or 3, characterised 
thereby, that the chute element (19) arranged at the opening rim of the 

door (15) is detachably connected with a depression (18) arranged at 
the base (17) of the interior space (16), wherein the melt water guided 

by the connection with the depression (18) is led to the chute element 
(19). 
Freezer appliance according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised thereby, that the chute (40) and the chute element (19) 

display different lengths, wherein the chute element (19) is executed 
to be shorter and, when the door is closed, enters with unshortened 

length into a concavity (20) provided there.
