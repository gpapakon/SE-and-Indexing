<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a solid oxide fuel 
cell and a manufacturing process thereof. There has been conventionally suggested a type of 
solid oxide fuel cell which is of a structure wherein cells, 
each of which is composed of a solid electrolyte, an anode 
provided on one side of the solid electrolyte and a cathode 
provided on the other side of the solid electrolyte, and 
separators for isolating a fuel gas and an oxide gas are 
laminated alternately. The cells and the separators must be 
joined in such a manner not to cause leakage of a fuel gas 
and/or an oxide gas. The temperature wherein the solid oxide 
fuel cell is operated is very high (about 1000°C), compared 
with the temperature wherein the solid oxide fuel cell is not 
operated (room temperature), and the coefficient of thermal 
expansion of the cells and that of the separators are different. 
Thereby, while the solid oxide fuel cell is operated 
and stopped repeatedly, the cells will be broken by thermal 
stress.  In the light of these problems, an edge melt-sealing 
method has been suggested. In the edge melt-sealing method, 
a non-conductive viscous material, such as, Pyrex (trade 
name) is coated on the surface of the solid oxide fuel cell 
at each joining portion between a separator and the adjacent 
cell. Even adopting this method, however, if the joint 
between the separator and the cell is not sufficiently firm, 
leakage of a gas will occur during operation of the solid 
oxide fuel cell. An object of the present invention is to provide a 
solid oxide fuel cell wherein leakage of a gas does not occur 
and repetitions of operation and stoppage of the solid oxide 
fuel cell does not cause breakage of cells, and a manufacturing 
process thereof. In order to attain the object, a solid oxide fuel 
cell comprises cells, each of which has a solid electrolyte, 
an anode disposed on a first side of the solid electrolyte 
and a cathode disposed on a second side of the solid electrolyte, 
and separators which are alternately laminated, and a 
sealant, which is made of a mixture of ceramic fiber and 
glass, is inserted between each cell and the adjacent separator. In the structure, the ceramic fiber contained in the  
 
sealant has flexibility and eases thermal stress caused by 
the difference between the separators and the cells in the 
coefficient of thermal expansion. Also, the sealing under a 
high temperature is guaranteed by the glass contained in the 
sealant. This and other objects and features of the present 
invention will be
