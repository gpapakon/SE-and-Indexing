<DESCRIPTION>
 CARBONISING OF MATERIALSThis invention relates generally to methods and apparatus for use in the carbonising of materials including a retort which can be used for the production of high grade activated carbons. Activated carbon has the property of adsorbing large quantities of gases and finds application in gas masks, solvent adsorption, clarifying of liquids, gold recovery processes, food treatment, water treatment and the like.Apparatus currently in use for the manufacture of Activated Carbons include: multiple heart furnace rotary kilns and fluidized bed furnace. Each of these processes suffer certain disadvantages which include heat distribution, not uniformity of activation and expense of construction.It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved apparatus which alleviates one or more of the aforementioned disadvantages .According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided apparatus for use in the carbonising of material comprising: a retort having a carbonising zone therein; a delivery inlet for delivering material to be carbonised to said carbonising zone; a discharge outlet for discharging material from said carbonising zone; an activation zone for receiving material from said carbonising zone via said discharge outlet, said zones being arranged so that when, in use, material can pass therethrough on a continuous basis; and means for heating said carbonising zone and said activation zone. 

 Preferably, the retort is disposed in a generally- upright orientation so as to define an upper region and an lower region. Advantageously, the delivery inlet is disposed within the lower region and the discharge outlet is disposed within the upper region, the material within the carbonising zone passing upwardly between the inlet and the outlet when the apparatus is in use.The apparatus may further include delivery means for delivering material to the inlet. In one form, the delivery means may comprise a tube which may be generally uprightly disposed and extends into the carbonising zone with one end thereof defining the inlet, the aforementioned one end being disposed in the lower region of the retort.The apparatus may further include stirring means for mixing material within the carbonising zone. In one form, the stirring means comprise a spiral or screw shaped member which assists in the passage of material from the lower region towards the upper region of the retort. The screw or spiral shapes member may comprise a hollow central shaft having a passage therethrough so

CLAIMS :
1. Apparatus for use in the production of carbonised material comprising: a retort having a carbonising zone therein; a delivery inlet for delivering material to be carbonised to said carbonising zone; a discharge outlet for discharging material from said carbonising zone; an activation zone for receiving material from said carbonising zone via said discharge outlet said zones being arranged so that when in use material can pass therethrough on a continuous basis; and means for heating said carbonising zone and said activation zone.
2. Apparatus according to claim 1 wherein said retort is disposed in a generally upright orientation where, in use, and includes an upper region and a lower region and wherein said delivery inlet is disposed in said lower region and said discharge outlet is disposed in said upper region said material within said carbonising zone passing upwardly between said inlet and outlet when the apparatus is in use.
3. Apparatus according to claim 2 further including delivery means for delivering material to said inlet, said delivery means comprising a tube extending into said carbonising zone with one end thereof defining said inlet said one end being disposed in said lower region.
4. Apparatus according to claim 3 further including stirring means for mixing the material within said carbonising zone.
5. Apparatus according to claim 4 wherein said stirring means comprises a spiral or screw shaped member which assists in the passage of the material from the lower region to the upper region. 


 6. Apparatus according to claim 5 wherein said screw or spiral shaped member comprises a hollow central shaft so as to define said delivery means.
7. Apparatus according to claim 5 or 6 wherein said spiral or screw shaped member comprises two spaced apart sections, the intermediate portion thereof forming a settling region within said carbonising zone.
8. Apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 7 wherein said activation zone comprises a generally annular chamber which surrounds said carbonising zone and arranged so that material enters said activation zone towards an upper region thereof and passes downwardly therealong.
9. Apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 7 wherein said activation zone comprises a plurality of conduits which are disposed around the outer wall of the carbonising zone and arranged so that material enters said conduits at an upper region and passes downwardly therealong.
10. Apparatus according to any preceding claim wherein said heating means comprises a combustion chamber said carbonising zone and said activation zone being disposed within said combustion chamber.
11. Apparatus according to any preceding claim further including means for delivering steam to said activation zone.
12. Apparatus according to claim 11 wherein said means for delivering steam is arranged so that the steam is delivered at spaced intervals along its length.
13. Apparatus according to any preceding claim further including auxiliary steam delivery means for delivering steam to said carbonising zone.
14. A retort for use in the production of carbonaceous material, the retort comprising: 


 a retort body having a chamber therein defining a carbonising zone; an inlet conduit having an inlet at one end thereof and said inlet having disposed in the region of one end thereof; an outlet disposed at the region of the opposite end thereof; and an auxiliary chamber defining an activation zone which is operative communication with said outlet for receiving material from the chamber.
