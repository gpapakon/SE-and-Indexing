<ABSTRACT>
A sufficiently fine pattern is formed using a resist 
material comprising a copolymer of a silicon-containing 

acrylate and an acrylate which contains a group, that is 
eliminated by an acid, the polarity of which changes 

after elimination of this group and which becomes soluble 
in an aqueous alkali solution, and a photo-acid generator 

which generates an acid upon irradiation with a 
radiation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a resist material, 
and a pattern forming process using the resist material. As the integration density of semiconductor 
devices has become higher and higher in recent years, a 
resist material capable of forming a miniature pattern 
has been required. In patterning processes, a technology called 
"two-layered resist process" has been employed which 
comprises the steps of forming a lower resist layer for 
levelling on a to-be-patterned material (to-be-etched 
material), then forming an upper resist layer, exposing 
this upper resist layer, developing, and transferring the 
resulting pattern to the lower resist layer to obtain a 
mask pattern. In this case, a resist material for 
constituting the upper resist layer must have performance 
capable of withstanding at least etching for transferring 
the pattern to the lower resist layer (generally O2 RIE, 
that is, reactive ion etching using oxygen). Polyacrylate type resists, polysiloxane type 
resists and polysilane type resists, have high etching 
resistance due to the introduction of silicon (Si) into 
an ester portion of the resist materials. They are known 
as the materials for the upper layer resist material in 
the multi-layer resist process described above (for 
example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) 
Nos. 2-191957, 2-239251, 3-217845, 3-261952 and 4-42229). 
In all of them, development is based on the difference of 
molecular weights between exposed area at the time and 
unexposed area. As a result, sharp patterning cannot be 
conducted and swell of the resist pattern occurs at the 
time of development, limiting their usefulness for  
 
obtaining miniature patterns. Because of the ever-increasing 
integration density of semiconductor 
devices, this is a significant drawback. Moreover, JP-A-3 289 659 discloses a resist 
material comprising (a) a trimethylsilylmethyl 
methacrylate - methacrylic acid copolymer and (b) a 
sulfonic acid ester as a photoacid generator. This 
copolymer is stated to be alkali soluble and a 
dissolution inhibitor is added to the alkali-soluble 
polymer to form an alkali-insoluble material. An 
acid generated by the copolymer on photo-irradiation 
acts on the dissolution inhibiter so that it loses 
the dissolution-inhibiting effect and, thus, the base 
polymer can be developed by an alkali. This is an 
approach to be contrasted with that in which the base 
polymer per se is insoluble in alkali but can 
dissolve therein (development) when the polymer 
undergoes change in polarity
