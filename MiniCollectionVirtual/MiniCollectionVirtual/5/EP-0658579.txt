<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to thickening agents 
and the use thereof in cosmetics and textiles. In 
particular, the present invention relates to alkyl 
and/or alkylphenyl poly(oxyalkylene)sorbate copolymers 
and the salts thereof. The major part of synthetic thickening agents 
consist of polymers and copolymers capable of acting as 
thickening agents following a partial or total 
neutralization. In these cases, the low solubility or the 
insolubility in water of the non-neutralized polymer 
are made use of, thus allowing to obtain solutions or 
dispersions of the polymer in relatively high 
concentrations and of sufficiently low viscosities. 
This permits the use and the dosage of the thickening 
agent until the time of the neutralization thereof. Polymer systems behaving like this have been known 
for a long time and they are in various physical forms 
which are more or less easy to use. Thickening agents in aqueous solutions are known, 
e. g. some non cross-linked poly(meth)acrylic acids 
which, however, are rather difficult to use due to the 
high viscosity thereof, and moreover are not very 
effective. Powdered thickening agents are also known, for 
example, cross-linked poly(meth)acrylic acids described 
in USA Patent 2,798,053. These products are very effective, but they are  
 
used more and more seldom as they cannot meet the 
current technological requirements since, to use them 
it is necessary to prepare an aqueous dispersion of the 
acidic form to use in the thickening process. The step 
of dispersion of the acidic form is very laborious and 
lengthy, moreover the obtained thickening agents are 
not resistant to salts. Effective and easy to use polymer thickening 
agents are the copolymers in aqueous emulsion or 
polymer latexes, as those described in the UK Patent 
870,994. They are copolymers of methacrylic acid with 
alkyl (C1-C4) acrylates, optionally cross-linked, 
obtained with emulsion polymerization techniques. 
According to these methods, poorly viscous latexes can 
be obtained, the active content of which ranges from 25 
to 50 % by weight. Nevertheless, the salt resistance of these 
products is still insufficient. Polymer systems, preferably in the form of latex, 
which are a further advance in terms of effectiveness 
and salt resistance while being easy to handle are 
those described in EP-A- 0,013,836 and European Patents 
0,011,806 and 0,109,820. These publications claim 
copolymers obtained from monomeric mixtures similar to 
those described in the already cited UK Patent
