<ABSTRACT>
A retainer ring (12) having expandable slides for 
attaching a passenger side air bag (14) to an air bag 

module canister (28). The retainer ring accommodates 
slight variations in the canister thus permitting the air 

bag cushion to be securely fastened to the canister without 
the formation of gaps between the air bag cushion and the 

canister. This reduces gas leakage from the canister 
during deployment of the air bag cushion. A self-locking 

mechanism may also be provided to permit assembly of the 
retainer ring without the need for fasteners or special 

tools.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to inflatable-type modular
occupant restraint systems for passenger vehicles or, as it is more
commonly known, an air bag restraint system. More particularly,
this invention relates to an improved device for attaching the air
bag cushion to an air bag module canister.An air bag restraint system module typically includes an air
bag cushion, a canister which has an open side and encloses an
inflator and at least part of the air bag, and a cover which
conceals the module from view. When an air bag module is designed
for the driver side of a vehicle the module is located in the
steering wheel behind a cosmetic cover which is an integral part of
the steering wheel design. When the air bag module is designed
for the passenger side of a vehicle, the container may be located
just behind the vehicle dashboard, cosmetic cover, or passenger
side instrument panel (hereinafter referred to as "dashboard") and
the cover may form an integral part of the vehicle dashboard.When the vehicle is involved in a collision, a crash signal
initiates operation of the inflator to cause the air bag to deploy.
The inflator produces an inert gas (e.g., nitrogen) which is
directed under pressure into the air bag to force the air bag out
of the container incorporated into the module and into the
passenger compartment of the vehicle. As the air bag is forced out
of the container, the pressure exerted on the cosmetic cover causes
selected portions of the cosmetic cover to separate, in a 
predetermined manner, along tear seams or breakaway seams
to enable the air bag to be directed into the passenger
compartment. As the air bag is directed into the passenger
compartment, it is inflated by the continued flow of gas
produced by the inflator. To provide for the proper
inflation of the air bag cushion the cushion must be
securely fastened to the canister.In order to attach the air bag cushion to the
canister opening, a rectangular metal retainer ring of
fixed circumference may be sewn into the air bag cushion
adjacent to a gas inlet opening designed to receive a gas
from an inflator. One side of the retainer ring is affixed
to one canister wall with fasteners, such as rivets or the
like, passed through fastener holes in the side of the
ring. The antithetical side of the ring is attached to the
opposite canister wall in a like manner. Typically, the
centre section of one side of the air bag retainer ring is
fastened to the canister first, then the ends of the ring
are attached to the canister. If the ring is

inside and an outside, including a wall (26a,26b) having an

inner and an outer surface, said wall defining a cavity for
a gas generator and at least part of said air bag cushion

in a folded condition, said wall further defining an
opening to said cavity; and
a band-like cushion retainer ring (12) comprising a
pair of first sides (32a,32b) and a pair of second sides

(34a,34b) attached to the first sides, said first sides
being attached to said air bag cushion adjacent said air

bag cushion third portion, and being attached to said air
bag cushion canister wall adjacent said canister opening,

fixedly securing said air bag cushion third portion to said
canister, characterised in that each of said second sides

comprises a first section (36a) and a second section (36b)
slidably engaged with said second side first section.
An air bag cushion assembly according to claim 1
wherein said first section (36a) forms a channel and the

second section (36b) is in the form of a solid bar which
slides within said first section channel.
An air bag cushion assembly according to claim 1
wherein said first section (36a) has an elongated slot (44) 

running substantially the length of the first section and
said second section defines a plane, said second section

(36b) having a tab (46) substantially perpendicular to the
plane of the second section, said tab slidably engaged in

said elongated slot of said first section.
An air bag cushion assembly according to claim 1
wherein said slidably engaged second side (34a) comprises a
