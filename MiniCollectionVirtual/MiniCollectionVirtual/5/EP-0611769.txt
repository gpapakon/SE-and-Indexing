<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to fluorinated silylated aromatic 
compounds, their intermediates, methods of use in treating 
diseases associated with deficiencies of cholinergic 
transmission in the central nervous system and methods for 
their preparation. Compounds of the present invention have the following 
Formula I: 
stereoisomers or mixtures thereof, and pharmaceutically 
acceptable salts thereof, wherein:
 
   each of Z and Z' are independently H or F, provided that 
at least one of Z or Z' is F;
 
 
   Q is 
   X is H, Br, Cl, F or CF₃;
 
   Y is H, OH, (C₁₋₆) alkyl, -(CH₂)mOR₅, hydroxy (C₁₋₆) alkyl, 
(CH₂)nNR₆R₆', azido, CN, CO₂R₄, COR₆, SO₃H, Br, Cl, F, NO₂ or 
-(CH₂)n SiR₁'R₂'R₃', provided that when both Z and Z' are F 
then Y is H or F;
 
   R₁, R₂, R₃, R₁', R₂'and R₃' are each independently 
C₁₋₁₀ alkyl or (CH₂)n aryl;
 
   R₄ is H, (C₁₋₁₀) alkyl, phenyl, benzyl or phenethyl;
 
   R₅ is H, (C₁₋₁₀) alkyl, benzyl or phenethyl;
 
   R₆ and R₆' are independently hydrogen or C₁₋₁₀ alkyl;
 
   m is an integer of 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4; and
 
   n is an integer of 0, 1 or 2. The compounds of the present invention are used to treat 
patients having conditions responsive to the acetylcholin-esterase-inhibiting 
properties of the present compounds such 
as in the treatment of Degenerative Dementias. The terms "(C₁₋₆) alkyl" and " (C₁₋₁₀) alkyl" mean 
straight or branched chain alkyl radicals containing 
respectively from 1 to 6 carbon atoms and from 1 to 10 
carbon atoms, including, but not limited to, methyl, ethyl, 
n-propyl, iso-propyl, n-butyl, iso-butyl, sec-butyl,  
 
t-butyl, n-pentyl, 1-methylbutyl, 2,2-dimethylbutyl, 
2-methylpentyl, 2,2-dimethylpropyl, n-hexyl and so on. 
Likewise, the terms "(CH₂)n" or "(CH₂)m" may represent 
alkylene chains which may be branched or straight-chained. "Hydroxy(C₁₋₆) alkyl" means a (C₁₋₆) alkyl group having 
from 1 to 3 hydroxy substituents thereon. Preferably, there 
is only one hydroxy substituent at the alpha position 
(attached to the carbon atom which is directly attached to 
the phenyl). "Ts" or "tosyl" means 
Tosyl derivatives 
mean 
wherein R is C₁₋₆ alkylene. "Aryl" includes both carbocyclic and heterocyclic 
moieties of which phenyl, pyridyl, indolyl, indazolyl, furyl 
and thienyl are of primary interest; these moieties being 
inclusive of their position isomers such as, for example, 
2-, 3-, or 4-pyridyl, 2- or 3-furyl and thienyl, 1-, 2-, or 
3-indolyl or the 1- and 3-indazolyl, as well as the dihydro 
and tetrahydro analogs of the furyl and thienyl moieties.
