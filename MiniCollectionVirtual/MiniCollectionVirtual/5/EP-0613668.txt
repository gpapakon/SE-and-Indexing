<ABSTRACT>
The prosthetic assembly, especially for the knee joint, comprises a femoral element (F) and a tibial element (T). The elements (F) and (T) have complementary male (1) - female (2) bearing and sliding articulation shapes, the said shapes (1) and (2) each exhibiting cross-sectional profiles capable of automatically causing in combination with a flexion movement corresponding to the start of flexion of the knee, a voluntary internal rotation movement of the tibial element (T) with respect to the femoral element (F) through a defined limited angle.

Prosthesis assembly for knee prosthesis
comprising a femoral element (F) and a tibial element

(T) having matching articulated male (1) and female
(2) support and sliding surfaces, characterised:


in that the female shape (2) consists of two
curved concentric segments (2a) (2b) of different

radii (r) (r1), said segments (2a) (2b) being joined
by approximately a quarter circle (2c) (2d)

respectively to two other curved segments (2e) (2f)
the radii (r2) of which are identical but of which

the centres (O) (O1) are aligned and offset by a
distance (d), one of these centres (O1) corresponding

to the centre of the curved concentric segments (2a)
(2b), the curved connecting segments (2e) (2f) being

joined by a straight segment (2g) corresponding to
said distance (d),
and in that the male shape (1) consists of
two curved segments (1a) (1b) of different radii (r3)

(r4) corresponding to the radii (r) (r1) of curved
concentric segments (2a) (2b) of the female shape (2)

and of which the centres (O2) (O3) are offset by a
value (d1) corresponding to the offset (d) of centres

(O) (O1) of curved concentric segments (2a) (2b) of
the female shape (2), said curved segments (1a) (1b)

of the male shape (1) being linked by two straight
segments (1c) (1d) to a single curved segment (1e)

the radius of which (r3) corresponds to the radii
(r2) of each curved connecting segment (2e) (2f) of

female shape (2), the curved concentric (1b) and
straight segments (1d) of the male shape on the

posterior side are joined by a radius (1h) whereas
the curved concentric segments (2b) and the quarter

circle (2d) of the female shape on the posterior side
are joined by a radius (2h) of length equal to or 

less than the length of radius (1h) of the male shape
(1),

   said shapes (1) and (2) each having sagittal
cross-sectional profiles capable of automatically

causing, in conjunction with a flexing movement
corresponding to the start of flexing of the knee, an

internal movement of rotation of tibial element (T)
relative to femoral element (F) over a predetermined

limited angle.
Assembly as claimed in claim 1,
characterised in that the matching shapes (1) and (2)

are located on one of the two sides of each element
(F) (T) and, in particular, on the internal lateral

side.
Assembly as claimed in claim 2,
characterised in that, opposite matching shapes (1)

and (2), each element has articulation features.
Assembly as claimed in claim 3,
characterised in that the articulation features

consist of matching support shapes that allow
pivoting and/or sliding.
Assembly as claimed in claim 3,
characterised in that the articulation features

consist of a transverse pin (4).
Assembly as claimed in claim 5,
characterised in that the transverse pin (4) is

joined to a fixed part (5) of tibial element (T) and
its free end has a ball joint (6) engaged in a

matching shape (7) of femoral element (F).
Assembly as claimed in claim 1,
characterised in that the male shape (1) is located 

at the level of femoral element (F) whereas the
female shape (2) is located at the level of the

tibial element (T).
Assembly as claimed in claim 1,
characterised in that the female shape (2) is located

in a separately mounted device (3) which is
physically connected to and capable of pivoting

angularly relative to the tibial element (T).
Assembly as claimed in claim 1,
characterised in that the femoral (F) and tibial (T)

elements are controlled by a tensioning and damping
device (8) (9) (10).
