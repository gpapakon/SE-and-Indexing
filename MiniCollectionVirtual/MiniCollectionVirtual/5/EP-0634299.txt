<ABSTRACT>
A filter unit (F) for an automobile air conditioner, 
having a filter member (31) for collecting dust contained 

in air passing through an air passage formed in the 

automobile air conditioner (10), characterised in that the 
filter unit defines a pair of opened bypass passages (39L, 

39R) for letting the flow of air bypass the filter member, 
the bypass passages being provided in the cross section of 

the air passage where the filter member is located.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improvement in a
filter unit to be installed in the air passage of an
automobile air conditioner and used for collecting dust and
the like contained in the air blown into the interior of an
automobile.A known type of automobile air conditioner has been
designed to enhance comfort in the car interior by
installing a filter member midway in a casing forming an
air passage so as to collect dust, dirt and the like mixed
with the air taken in through an intake unit. The filter
member is made of a material such as pulp or cloth and the
material is bent into a wavelike shape in cross section to
increase the filtering surface area. The filter member of
this type is installed in the air passage closer to the
downstream side of the flow of air than a blowing fan
fitted to the intake unit and also closer to the upstream
side than a mixing door rotatably fitted to a heater unit,
for example, on the front side of the built-in evaporator
of a cooler unit.In such a conventional filter unit for an automobile
air conditioner, the filter member has been disposed over
the whole area of the cross section of the air passage.Filter members used for a certain period of time need
cleaning or replacing. If, however, the filter member is
continuously used despite the fact that its cleaning or
replacement time has passed, it may clog up. Moreover, the
filter member becomes easily blocked up even before its 
cleaning time comes if it is used in a specific area full
of dust and dirt such as volcanic ashes.As the filter member is disposed over the whole area
of the cross section of the air passage in the conventional
filter unit, the air flow resistance in the air passage
considerably increases when the filter member is clogged
with waste matter. Consequently, there is the possibility
that a designated air flow is not supplied into the car
interior.Some automobile air conditioners are equipped with a
cooling air intake in an intake unit which is used to lead
part of the air sent from a blower fan to a motor for
driving the blower fan so as to cool the motor. When the
blower fan is driven, moisture and powder snow contained in
air outside the automobile is allowed to penetrate into the
intake unit. In order to prevent the moisture and the like
from being introduced into the motor, the cooling air
intake is installed so that it may protrude up the bottom
edge of a casing. Moreover, the moisture and the like thus
introduced are discharged from the car interior by a cooler
unit which is designed to
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A filter unit (F), for use in an automobile air
conditioner (10), comprising a generally planar filter

member (31) for collecting dust contained in air passing
through an air passage, and an open bypass passage (39L,

39R) provided in the cross-section of the air passage for
letting the flow of air bypass the filter member (31),

characterised in that there are a pair of the bypass
passages (39L, 39R), which are located in the same plane as

the filter member (31) and are spatially separated from one
another by the filter member (31), with the total opening

area deriving from the two bypass passages accounting for
10% âˆ¼ 20% of the sectional area of the air passage.
A filter unit according to claim 1, characterised in
that the bypass passages are located symmetrically to each

other with respect to the filter member.
A filter unit according to claim 1 or claim 2,
characterised in that the bypass passages are provided in

respective opposite end portions of a rectangular cross-section
of the air passage where the filter member is

located.
A filter unit according to any one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the filter member is carried by a

frame, and each of the bypass passages (39L, 39R) is
constituted by a respective opening (38, 38) formed in the

frame carrying the filter member.
A filter unit according to any one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that one of the bypass passages (39R) is 

constituted by an opening (38) formed in a frame carrying
the filter member, and the other of said bypass passages

(39L) is constituted by a gap (S) formed in the cross-section
of the air passage between an inner wall of the air

passage and a distal end of the frame when the frame is
secured in place.
A filter unit according to any one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the filter member is carried by a

frame, and each of the bypass passages (39L, 39R) is
defined by a respective gap (S1, S2) between lateral ends

of the frame and inner walls of the air passage when the
frame is secured in place.

characterised in that the bypass passages have a total

opening area permitting air flow of at least 2 m
3
/min under
a condition that the filter member is completely clogged.
A filter unit according to any preceding claim,
characterised in that the filter member (31) is installed
