<ABSTRACT>
"WINDING HANDLE FOR CAR JACK" relates to a 
crank or winding handle (3) connected to the 

spindle (15) of a car jack by means of the loose 
insertion of its end (18) into a washer (1) secured 

to the spindle. The end (18) has two swaged 
or punch-pressed lugs (4) on both sides of the 

faces of the washer, which prevent the winding 
handle from being removed. It is a simple, economical 

unit, which ensures the perfect turning 
movement of the car jack and prevents the displacement 

or shifting of the spin or turning axis 
(6).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a winding handle used for 
operating car jacks, so as to be able to raise or lower 
the car, for example, when changing wheels. Usually, in those car jacks which operate by means 
of the turning or rotation of a screw-threaded spindle, 
the use of a crank or winding handle is necessary in order 
to make the said spindle turn so that the jack, by means 
of a member that it is equipped with, can be raised or lowered, 
depending in which direction the winding handle is 
rotated. Known devices of this type have winding handles which 
are independent of the body of the jack and which, at the 
time of use, are connected to the spindle and then later 
separated from it. The problem with these winding handles 
is that they are units which are separate from the jack 
body, with the resulting risk of loss or mislaying, for 
example. Winding handles are also known which are permanently 
connected with the spindle of the jack, forming a whole 
with the body of the jack itself. Winding handles of this 
type which are known have the inconvenience of their bad 
workability, especially at the start of the operation, 
when the jack is very close to the ground and space is 
needed so that the user's hand does not touch or scrape 
the ground. Some of these winding handles are equipped with 
hinged or articulated parts and even telescopic, 
although they improve the workability, still have the inconvenience 
of being expensive. One objective of the invention is a winding handle  
 
for car jacks that is connected to the spindle of the jack 
by means of a floating connection which does not need any 
kind of mechanism. Another objective of the invention is a winding handle 
that is composed of one single body, which in its folded 
position, adjusts to and fits in with the shape of 
the jack. Another objective of the invention is a winding handle 
which is easily and perfectly workable. And finally, another objective of the invention is a 
winding handle which is economical to manufacture, so 
that its final sales price can be low. In order to put these objectives into practice, the 
invention claims a winding handle which is composed of one 
single body with one elbowed end provided with a sheath 
so that it can be grasped or held, another section at a 
right angle to and immediately after the elbowed end, 
and the opposite end, which is V-shaped. The cross-section 
of the winding handle is preferably circular. The more outer wing of the V-shaped end of the winding 
handle is equipped with two

Winding handle for car jack, applicable to car 
jacks which are equipped with support members (11, 12) 

operated by the rotation of a screw-threaded spindle (15) 
which is connected to them, in which the winding handle 

provides the said rotation of the spindle by its being 
connected to it, which is characterized in that a flat 

washer (1) is connected to the free end of the spindle 
(15) by means of a section of the side surface of the 

same, in such a way that the continent plane of the 
washer coincides with a theoretical axial plane of the 

spindle, in that the end (18) of the winding handle (3) 
moves with sufficient play inside the hole in the washer, 

with two areas of this end having been punch-pressed (4) 
to provide lugs which are of a greater cross-section 

than the dimensions of the hole in the washer (1), in 
that the lugs formed by the punch-press are spaced at a 

certain distance from each other and this distance is 
somewhat greater than the thickness of the washer, with 

the lugs being arranged one on each side of the hole in 
the said washer, in that the end (18) of the winding 

handle (3) is one of the wings of a V-shaped section in 
which the winding handle finishes on the side towards 

the spindle, with this end (16) of the winding handle 
being followed by a straight section (7), whose alignment 

coincides with the centre of the space between the punch-pressed 
lugs (4) of the section (18). 
Winding handle for car jack, in accordance with 
claim 1, characterized in that the section (7) of the 

winding handle aligned with the centre of the space 
 

between the punch-pressed lugs (4) forms an angle, preferably 
of 90o, with another section (8) of the same winding 

handle, with this section finishing in an elbow-shaped section 
(10, 11), which is used to operate the winding handle 

when turning. 
Winding handle for car jack, in accordance with 
claims 1 and 2, characterized in that the cross-section 

of the winding handle (3) is circular in shape. 
Winding handle for car jack, in accordance with 
claims 1 and 2, characterized in that the cross section of 

the winding handle (3) is of a geometrical, and preferable 
regular, shape. 
Winding handle for car jack, in accordance with 
claim 1, characterized in that the whole of the winding 

handle (3), on turning in relation to the washer (1), 
allows the said winding handle to adjust to the contours 

of the area around the car jack.
