<ABSTRACT>
The transition between the L3 and L4 larval stages of the nematode filarial parasites such as Dirofilaria immitis occurs after introduction into the animal host and is mediated by at least one metalloprotease and/or cysteine protease unique to the L3 or L4 larval stage. Methods to prevent and treat filarial infection are provided by vaccines comprised of the immunogenic determinants of the characteristic L3 or L4 proteases and by administration of inhibitors of these proteases.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PROTEASE VACCINE AGAINST HEARTWORMTechnical FieldThe invention relates to prevention and treatment of nematode-caused filarial disease in animal hosts, such as heartworm which occurs most commonly in dogs. Heartworm infection is caused by the nematode Dirofilaria immitis. and the treatment and prevention method of the invention can be applied specifically to this disease by employing the characteristic metallo- protease and/or cysteine protease associated with this organism.Background ArtThe heartworm infection caused by D^. immitis is a widely distributed problem in dogs in most regions of the world with the exception of Africa. Current treatment is generally chemoprophylactic with agents designed to directly kill the infecting organisms. While this treatment has gained acceptance, because of the inherent toxicity of such treatment, it would be preferable to immunologically protect the host against infection, or to revise the chemoprophylactic regime to include less toxic agents. The present invention is directed to this goal. Other nematode filarial infections are of even greater significance and involve life cycles of the infectious agent similar to those related to heartworm. For example, of more concern are the other filarids which infect humans, and more than 200 million people worldwide are estimated to have such infections. Filarids which 

 infect humans include Brugia malayi. Wuchereria bancrof i, and Onchocerca volvulus. These are serious infections which can cause blindness and elephantiasis in humans. At present, there is no effective vaccine available against filarial nematode infection.As the life cycles of the infectious agents are similar in all of these diseases, heartworm infection can be used as an illustration. This life cycle can be described as follows: Heartworm infection, specifically in dogs, generally occurs through passage of the third-stage larvae (L3) of the nematode D^. immitis into the subcutaneous tissue from a mosquito vector. When these larvae are passed into the animal's tissue, their life cycle is continued by molting into a fourth larval stage ( 4) , which then migrates toward the heart and pulmonary arteries where the subsequent stage matures into an adult. The L3 remain at the site of inoculation by the mosquito until molting occurs. L4 emigrate through cutaneous tissue and muscle and do not molt to fifth stage for 50-70 days after infection (Grieve, R. , et al., Epidem Rev (1983) Â£:220-246) . Adult D_-_ immitis. which are on the order of 12-20 cm (males) and

A veterinary or pharmaceutical composition for immunization of an animal host against filarial nematode infection, which composition comprises an amount of at least one protease in purified and isolated form effective to immunize said animal host and which protease is obtainable by isolation from L3 or L4 lysate or from L3/L4 excretory-secretory material of said filarial nematode, or an immunogenic subunit thereof.
2. A veterinary or pharmaceutical composition useful in treating or ameliorating the symptoms of filarial nematode infection in an animal host, which composition comprises an effective amount of an inhibitor of at least one protease which protease is obtainable by isolation from L3 or L4 lysate or from L3/L4 excretory- secretory material of said filarial nematode.
