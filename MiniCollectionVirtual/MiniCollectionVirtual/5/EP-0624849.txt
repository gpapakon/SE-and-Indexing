<ABSTRACT>
A system and method of rendering a curve using data look-up tables for 
rasterizing the curve. The curve is subdivided so that it is approximated by a series of straight 

line segments of approximately equal length, with no line segment exceeds two pixels in 
length. The system subdivides any line segment that crosses horizontal axis of two adjacent 

horizontal scan rows. If the line segment does not cross the horizontal axis of a scan row, the 
pixel does not require detailed analysis. If the line segment does cross the horizontal axis of a 

particular horizontal scan row, the system uses look-up tables to determine the distance from 
the center point of the pixel in which the line segment crosses the horizontal axis to the point 

at which the line segment crosses the horizontal axis. The system uses three indices as 
pointers to the data look-up table containing the desired data. The three indices are 

themselves pointers to separate index tables in which the multiplication calculations required 
for the data look-up table have been precalculated and are incorporated into the values stored 

in the index tables. The index tables also incorporate a reduction in resolution from 1/64 to 
1/8 pixel resolution. The index tables are also nonlinear to allow more data entries in areas 

where the round off error resulting from the resolution reduction are greatest. If the line 
segment crosses the horizontal axis to the left of the center of a pixel, the logic state for the 

pixel is changed. The system can be implemented on any computer and operates with any 
raster scan graphics display unit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a system and method for
rendering curves and, more particularly, to a system and method of rasterizing curves.Computer systems frequently include graphics displays such as a display
screen or graphic printer capable of displaying curves and alphanumeric characters.
Figure 1 illustrates a curve 2 and a series of alphanumeric characters 3 in the form of a
graph that may be displayed on a typical computer display screen or graphic printer.Graphic images are shown on the display screen or printer as a series of
small dots. A pixel represents the smallest element or dot on the display screen or
printer that can be addressed. The display screen or printed page is made up of many
scan lines arranged in one dimension, typically the horizontal dimension, with each scan
line being one pixel high. Each horizontal scan line is comprised of a series of pixels.
As an example, a typical laser printer may have a resolution of 300 dots per inch. This
means that the printed page is made up of 300 horizontal scan lines per inch, and each
horizontal scan line is made up of 300 pixels per inch. A curve or alphanumeric
character is displayed by the display screen or the printer using a group of pixels that
approximates the curve and character.A graphics display computer system generally includes a memory for
storing a digital representation of the curve or character to be displayed. In prior art
computer system, the digital values represent each pixel on the display screen or printed
page. This approach to graphics display would require an extremely large memory to
represent digital values for each pixel of a graphics display. Such a system is too slow
when initiaily generating digital values which represent a curve, and is also too slow
when manipulating the curve, such as when the curve is rotated or relocated on the
display screen. Similarly, prior art computer systems represent graphic alphanumeric
characters in memory as a bit-map where each bit in the bit-map corresponds to a pixel
on the display screen. The curves of the individual alphanumeric characters are defined
by the bit-map data for each alphanumeric character. This requires large amounts of
memory to store the bit-map data and made it difficult to manipulate the alphanumeric
characters, such as changing font type or font size. Because of these problems, many 
computer graphics systems utilize the BÃ©zier spline method of modeling curves. This
included a method of modeling alphanumeric characters as a series of lines
