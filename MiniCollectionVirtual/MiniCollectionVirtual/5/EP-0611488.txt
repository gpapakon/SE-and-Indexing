<ABSTRACT>
A dual polarisation waveguide probe system for use with a satellite dish (10) for receiving satellite signals orthogonally polarised in the same frequency band and for providing improved isolation between these polarised satellite signals is disclosed. The probe system has a waveguide (28) incorporated in a low-noise block receiver (12) into which two probes (34, 38) are located for receiving linearly polarised energy of both orthogonal senses. The probes (34, 38) are located in the same longitudinal plane on opposite sides of a single cylindrical bar reflector (36) which reflects one sense of polarisation and passes the orthogonal signal with minimal insertion loss, and then reflects the rotated orthogonal signal. The probes (34, 38) are spaced  lambda /4 from the reflector (36). A reflection rotator (44) is also formed using a thin plate which is orientated at 45 DEG  to the incident linear polarisation with a short circuit (46) spaced approximately a quarter wavelength ( lambda /4) behind the leading edge of the plate (43). This structure splits the incident energy into two equal components in orthogonal planes, one component being reflected by the leading edge (43) and the other component being reflected by the waveguide short circuit (46). The resultant 180 DEG  phase shift between the reflected components causes a 90 DEG rotation in the plane of linear polarisation upon re-combination so that the waveguide outputs (34a, 38a) are located in the same longitudinal plane. Various embodiments and advantages of the invention are described.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a dual polarisation
waveguide probe system for use with a satellite dish for
receiving signals broadcast by a standard satellite which
includes two signals orthogonally polarised in the same
frequency band. In particular, the invention relates to
a waveguide for use with a low-noise block receiver into
which two probes are disposed for coupling from the
waveguide desired broadcast signals to external circuitry.In one prior art arrangement the two probes are
axially separated along the length of the waveguide.
Because the desired signals are orthogonally polarised to
each other, the two probes are also located in the
waveguide at 90° to each other. In this arrangement a
reflective post is located between the two probes, but
parallel to the first probe and spaced therefrom by a
quarter wavelength distance assuming a maximum field and
optimum coupling to the probe. With this structure the
geometry is such that the probe output terminals on the
outside of the waveguide are at 90° to each other. This
provides a mechanical problem in connecting the probe
outputs directly to a planar printed circuit board. A
further problem is that inadequate connection between
probe and printed circuit board could cause increased
losses at the frequencies involved which are about 10 - 11
GHz.In a second prior art arrangement the two probes are 
located at the same axial position along the waveguide,
but are at 90° to each other by being printed on the
circuit board and are separated by a isolation patch,
also printed on the circuit board, to provide the
necessary isolation between the collected signals. With
this arrangement the circuit board effectively splits the
waveguide into two parts and this results in increased
mechanical complexity. In addition, this arrangement of
the two probes at the same axial location does not
provide as good isolation between the orthogonal signals
as does the axially separated probe arrangement.In another prior art arrangement the two probes are
located at 90° at the same axial location in a single
waveguide section. With this structure the output
terminals of the probes are also at 90° to each other
around the outside of the waveguide and suffers from the
same disadvantages as the first prior art arrangement.
It also suffers from some of the disadvantages of the
second prior arrangement, namely that the provision of
the two probes at the same axial location does not
provide as good isolation between the orthogonal signals
as does the axially separated probe
