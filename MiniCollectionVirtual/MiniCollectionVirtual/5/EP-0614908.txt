<CLAIMS>
A process for the preparation of a 3β-aminocholanic 
acid derivative of the formula II 


 
in which 


R(1) is
H or OH, 
R(2) is
H, α-OH or β-OH 
 
and 


R(3)
is an unbranched C
1
-C
4
-alkyl radical 
or a branched C
3
-C
4
-alkyl or a benzyl 
radical, 
 
or of a salt thereof with a mineral acid,
 
which comprises 


a) reacting a 3α-hydroxycholanic acid ester of the 
formula III  

 

 
with phthalimide to give the 3β-phthalimido 

derivative of the formula IV 

b) reacting a resulting 3β-phthalimidocholanic 
acid ester of the formula IV with hydrazine 

hydrate or phenylhydrazine and 
c) splitting the phthalimide group by treating the 
reaction product with an aqueous solution of a 

mineral acid, an acid addition salt of the 
compound II with the mineral acid being formed, 

and 
d) if appropriate converting a resulting salt into 
the free compound of the formula II. 
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
reaction of a compound of the formula III with  

 
phthalimide is carried out in the presence of a 

phosphine and azodicarboxylic acid diethyl or 
diisopropyl ester. 
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein aqueous 
hydrochloric acid is used as the mineral acid.
