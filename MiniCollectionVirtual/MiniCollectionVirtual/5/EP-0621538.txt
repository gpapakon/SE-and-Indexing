<ABSTRACT>
An output apparatus automatically selects one of a 
plurality of interfaces and ensures receiving buffers 

corresponding to the interfaces. Data is taken through 
each interface into the corresponding receiving buffer 

and the device is controlled to change sizes of the 
receiving buffers in accordance with conditions of 

selection.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an output method or an
apparatus which uses an interface such as an RS-232C,
SCSI or parallel interface such as that produced by the
Centronics company.Recently, some printing devices have developed which
use interfaces and in which the device can change from
one interface to another automatically. However, if
one interface is selected, these printing devices can
only receive data through the selected interface.Accordingly, there has developed a concept in which
printing devices receive data simultaneously from
several interfaces. However, in such devices if they
have fixed areas of memory corresponding to each
interface as a receiving buffer, the total necessary
memory area-of the printing apparatus becomes a number
of times larger than that necessary for devices that 
receive data through a selected interface. It is known from WO90/12359 to provide a printer
with buffer storage in RAM which is allocated as needed
to accommodate data to be printed from a number of host
computers.According to the present invention, there is
disclosed printing apparatus operable to print data
received from external apparatuses, the printing
apparatus comprising;
a plurality of interfaces operable in use to receive
data for printing from the plurality of respective
external apparatuses;a memory comprising a memory area divided into a
plurality of areas constituting receiving buffers for
receiving data from the respective interfaces;control means operable to vary the size of the areas
constituting the respective receiving buffers;selection means operable to select one of said
interfaces; andmeans for reading out data for printing from the
receiving buffer corresponding to the selected interface;
   characterised in that the control means is 
responsive to the selection by said selection means to
vary the size of the area constituting the receiving
buffer of the selected interface so as to be greater than
the area of another one of said plurality of receiving
buffers.A method in accordance with the present invention is
set out in claim 5.The embodiment of the invention provides an output
method and apparatus capable of controlling a size of
receiving buffers when receiving data through each
interface. Fig. 1 is a cross-sectional view of a recording
apparatus, such as a laser beam printer.Fig. 2 is a block diagram showing controlling
construction of a printing apparatus.Fig. 3 is a schematic block diagram of a condition of a
memory map of RAM.Fig. 4 is a flow chart showing one example of
