<ABSTRACT>
A surface germicidal composition comprises a dyestuff which is capable of photo-dynamic inactivation of micro-organisms. The dyestuff preferably generates singlet oxygen on exposure to light and is substantive to microorganisms, conveniently being selected from the group comprising Rose Bengal, Erythrosin B and phthalocyanin sulphonates. The composition may optionally include other ingredients such as one or more surfactants (for cleaning purposes) and/or one or more solvents.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to germicidal compositions,
particularly for use on surfaces, ie compositions capable of
destroying or inactivating micro-organisms, particularly
surface-bound micro-organisms.In its broadest aspect the present invention provides a
method of killing bacteria in biofilms on a surface,
comprising applying to the surface a composition comprising
a dyestuff which is capable of photo-dynamic inactivation of
micro-organisms.It is preferred to use a dyestuff that generates singlet
oxygen on exposure to light. On absorption of light energy
a dye molecule is converted to a more energetic or exited
state (S1*) from its electronic ground state (S0). (Electron
spins are paired and so these are singlet states in the
language of spectroscopy, having a single energy level in a
magnetic field.)The excited state is short lived and can lose energy and
return to the ground state in a number of ways: by emission
of a quantum of light as fluorescence; by internal
conversion as the energy is degraded to heat, by collision
with a molecule of a different substance 
(fluorescence quenching).The short lived singlet state may also undergo a process
called intersystem crossing to a longer-lived excited
state, the triplet state. (The state is termed "triplet"
because the electron in the higher energy level is no
longer spin-paired with the electron in the lower level
and the excited state has three energy levels in a
magnetic field.)Interaction of the excited triplet state with ground state
molecular oxygen (which exists in the triplet state
normally) regenerates the dye ground state as energy is
transferred to the oxygen which is promoted to the
electronically excited singlet state. This means that,
under ideal circumstances, a single photosensitiser
molecule can generate many times its own concentration of
singlet oxygen.Singlet oxygen is highly reactive and photosensitised
oxidation proceeding via this route is known as Type II
photo-oxidation. Type II photo-oxidation is independent
of the photosensitiser used to generate the singlet
oxygen. An important feature of the sensitiser is that it
should have a high quantum yield of triplet formation
(that is, ideally, a triplet state should be produced for
each photon absorbed). Intersystem crossing to the
triplet state is facilitated by the presence of heavy
atoms in the molecule.Photo-oxidation of any vital component of an organism may
result in cell death (protein, polypeptide, amino-acids,
lipids with allylic hydrogens, tocopherols, sugars and
cellulose).
