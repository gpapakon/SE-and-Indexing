<ABSTRACT>
According to the invention, lumpy or granular material (1) is cooled by introducing the material (1) continuously into a tube (2), cooling it in at least part of this tube (2) by means of a low-boiling liquefied gas (3) and extracting it at the outlet orifice (6) of the tube (2). The tube (2) can be partially filled with the liquefied gas (3). The transport of the material (1) through the tube (2) can be assisted by a press ram (7). An inert gas, such as nitrogen, is suitable as a low-boiling liquefied gas (3). The process can do away completely with conveying means which, in previous processes, introduced frozen ice and heat into the cooling device.
