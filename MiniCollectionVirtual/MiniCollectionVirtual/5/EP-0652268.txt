<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to adhesive emulsion 
compositions for use on polyolefin substrates to promote adhesion 
thereto wherein the compositions have improved environmental 
properties, and specifically no substantial organic emissions. As is well known to those skilled in the art, polyolefins 
are widely used in the plastics industry in the molding 
of a variety of products. Ever increasing among such products 
are molded parts for automobiles because of the resistance of 
such polyolefins to corrosion. One of the difficulties that has 
long existed in the use of polyolefins in the production of 
molded plastic parts is the inability to establish a secure 
bonding relationship between the polyolefin and any coatings to 
be applied to it, notably including paint coatings. It has been proposed to employ, as an adhesion-promoting 
primer for polyolefins, and notably polypropylenes, a  
 
primer composition which is formulated to contain a chlorinated 
polyolefin. Eastman Chemical Products, Inc. has made and sold, 
for some time, such chlorinated polyolefins for use as adhesion 
promoters to polyolefins generally. Eastman, in its product 
brochure entitled "Eastman Chlorinated Polyolefins in Coatings 
for Selected Plastics" (August, 1988), suggests that a composition 
be formulated to include a chlorinated polyolefin solution 
sold under the trade designation "CP-343-3 (25%)" or "CP-343-1 
(25%)" in combination with toluene and sulfonated castor oil and 
sodium lauryl sulfate as surfactants. That composition, after it 
is formulated, is dispersed in de-ionized water to form an 
aqueous dispersion for use as a primer for polypropylene. Both of these chlorinated polyolefins are marketed by 
Eastman as solvent solutions containing 25 percent by weight of 
the chlorinated polyolefin and 75 percent by weight of xylene as 
the solvent. Thus, for every 100 parts by weight of the aqueous 
dispersion, a full third of the composition is aromatic solvent 
which evaporates into the atmosphere in the use of the primer 
composition. There has been a long standing environmental and 
ecological concern about the relatively high amounts of volatile 
organic solvents emitted to the atmosphere from the use of 
various liquid products. The Environmental Protection Agency or  
 
EPA requires that solvent emissions from a variety of product 
applications be reduced to the minimum possible amount. Maximum 
allowable limits are usually based on concepts known as Best 
Availability Control Technology or BACT and Reasonable

<CLAIMS>
An adhesion-promoting composition for use on 
polyolefin substrates comprising an aqueous emulsion of: 


(a) from 25 percent by weight to 75 
percent by weight of a chlorinated polyolefin; 
(b) at least 20 percent by weight of a 
plasticizer for the chlorinated polyolefin, 

said plasticizer being sufficiently non-volatile 
so as not to increase the VOC content 

of the composition; and 
 
said composition containing water sufficient to emulsify the 

composition, said composition having a VOC value of about 0. 
A composition as defined in claim 1 wherein the 
chlorinated polyolefin is chlorinated polypropylene. 
A composition as defined in claim 3 wherein the 
chlorinated polypropylene has a chlorine content of at least 

about 10 percent by weight. 
A composition as defined in claim 3 wherein the 
polypropylene has a molecular weight in excess of about 5,000. 
A composition as defined in claim 1 wherein the 
plasticizer is selected from the group consisting of aliphatic, 

cyclic and aromatic esters and polyesters, low molecular weight 
vinyl polymerization polymers and aliphatic, aromatic or halogenated 

hydrocarbon oils. 
A composition as defined in claim 1 wherein the 
composition contains a surfactant. 
A composition as defined in claim 7 wherein the 
surfactant is selected from the group consisting of anionic, 

cationic and nonionic surfactants. 
A composition as defined in claim 1 wherein the 
composition is also formulated to contain a water-based resin. 
A composition as defined in claim 9 wherein the 
water based resin is selected from the group consisting of vinyl 

polymerization polymers, nonionic polyhydroxy polymers, urethane 
emulsions, neutralized carboxylic acid-containing polymers and 

carbohydrate polymers.
