<ABSTRACT>
Applicant's invention includes an apparatus and associated method for treating or managing spinal deformities, including scoliosis, abnormal kyphosis, vertebral fractures and tumors, through attachment of spinal rods to ribs adjacent to the spine, rather than to the spine itself. The attachment means are designed whereby the ribs are completely encircled once the rods and attachment means are fully implanted, thereby virtually eliminating the chance of inadvertent dislodging of the rods.

<DESCRIPTION>
Applicant's invention relates to diseases and symptoms evidenced as deformities
in the human skeletal systems.The human spine is a system which consists of a succession of vertebral bodies
which, in its normal state, extends within and defines a single sagittal plane. Ideally,
there should be substantially no deviation in the frontal plane (perpendicular to the sagittal
plane from a straight line). Within the sagittal plane, a certain degree of lumbar
lordosis and thoracic kyphosis is normal and desirable. An excess degree of lumbar
curvature is known as hyperlordosis, while an abnormally flat lumbar succession of vertebral
bodies is known as hypolordosis. In the like manner, hyperkyphosis (most commonly
seen in Scheuermann's disease) is that condition evidenced by a greater-than-normal
degree of curvature in the thoracic 
spine which gives a hump-back type appearance.Scoliosis may be defined as lateral deviation and
rotation of a series of vertebrae from the midline
anatomic position of the normal spine axis. The deformity
occurs in three planes - frontal, sagittal and transverse.
Scoliosis, in its more severe embodiments, is a
debilitating, if not deadly disease. With the progression
of the curve, structural changes occur in the vertebrae
and in the formation and contour of the rib cage. This,
in turn, often threatens respiratory function and
capacity. The curvature of the spine itself can pose
danger to the spinal cord. Still further, the
interrelationships between other thoracic and abdominal
organs are changes and the normal function thereof is
imperilled. Fully 80% of all scoliosis cases are
idiopathic, i.e. the cause is cause unknown.There is no present "cure" for scoliosis as such, but
treatments of the symptoms have been known for some time -
treatments with often-times questionable effectiveness,
inherent intra-surgical danger to the patient, frequent
patient discomfort and/or substantial inconvenience, and
substantial likelihood of post-operative complication.Non-surgical control of scoliosis (as distinguished
from correction) is available. Such non-surgical
treatments include physical therapy, biofeedback,
electrical stimulation and orthosis (the Sayre cast, the
Hibbs and Risser casts, the Milwaukee brace, the Boston
brace and the Wilmington brace, for example). Reportedly,
however, these non-surgical methods can collectively
boast, at most, only a 70% success rate in arresting
further progression of scoliosis in cases of proven curve
progression in growing (relatively immature) spines.

comprising a second loop structure (18, 20) for at least partially, loosely encircling the
said at least one rib (14) on the said second lateral side of the recipient, the second rib

carriage (10) further comprising a second spinal rod attachment means for attaching
said second rib carriage (10) to the second spinal rod (12). 
Apparatus according to Claim 3, further comprising at least one additional
second apparatus attachment element, the or each additional second apparatus

attachment element including a rib carriage (10) for attachment to the second spinal
rod (12) and to at least one rib (14) of the recipient, the rib carriage (10) comprising a

first loop structure for at least partially, loosely encircling the said at least one rib (14)
of the recipient, the rib carriage further comprising second spinal rod attachment means

for attachment to the second spinal rod (12).

least two additional first apparatus attachment elements, and at least two additional

second apparatus attachment elements.
Apparatus according to any of Claims 3 to 5, further comprising a bridge
unit (70), one end of the bridge being provided with means (74) to connect the bridge

to a first spinal rod (12), and the other end of the bridge unit (70) being provided with
means to connect the bridge to a second spinal rod (12).
Apparatus according to any preceding claim, wherein the first and/or
second spinal rod is a solid rod.
Apparatus according to any preceding claim, wherein the rib carriage
further comprises a rib securing element (21) for substantially preventing sliding movement

of the said rib carriage on the at least one rib (14).
