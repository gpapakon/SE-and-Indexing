<ABSTRACT>
A blister pack comprises a cover member (12) and a 
support member (22). The cover member (12) includes a 

distortional region (14) formed from a plurality of slits 
(16) therein. A saleable item is located between the cover 

member (12) and the support member (22). The slits (16) 
allow the cover member to distort to the size of the 

saleable item.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to blister packaging for 
the display of saleable items and a method of manufacturing 
such blister packs. Previously, blister packaging has been formed in one of 
two ways. In a first method, the blister package comprises a 
single moulded plastics sheet adapted to be folded along a 
central region. In one or each part either side of the 
folded region a blister (or recess or protrusion) is formed. 
Where such a blister is formed in each part, it is preferred 
that after folding of the plastics sheet the two blisters 
are aligned to form a single storage region. The plastics 
sheet is otherwise generally planar. The item or items to 
be sold are for convenience usually located within the 
blister prior to folding of the plastics sheet. A second method, commonly known as captive blister 
packaging, comprises a planar sheet of plastics material 
into which a blister (or recess or protrusion) has been 
formed, held between a front and a back sheet of cardboard, 
the front sheet being provided with an opening through which 
the blister (though not the surrounding planar region of the 
plastics sheet) extends. One shortcoming associated with these conventional 
blister packages is the fact that a moulding process is used 
to form the plastics sheet and the blister. As an 
alternative to moulding, it is possible to stamp the blister 
into the planar plastics sheet. However, even this method 
suffers the same problem, which is that it is an expensive 
process to form either the mould or the stamp. Furthermore  
 
expenses are increased when different size articles are 
required to be packaged as this involves either remoulding 
or providing a new stamp. A further problem with conventional blister packaging 
is that it offers a potential purchaser no chance to feel or 
touch the packaged article prior to sale. It is becoming 
more prevalent for such people to express a desire to touch 
the article before purchase. There are several reasons to 
explain the popularity of this so-called "interactive" 
packaging. One such reason being that the potential 
purchaser has the ability to move the article around and see 
what it looks like from several different angles. A further 
reason being that it can often be the case that the 
potential purchaser wishes to discover how the product feels 
before purchase. Whilst it is often possible for conventional packaging 
to be opened and resealed to achieve the above, it is the 
case that many consumers will not purchase an item, the 
packaging

<CLAIMS>
A blister pack comprising a support member and a cover 
member having a distortional region, the cover member being 

mounted upon or formed integrally with the support member, 
wherein an item to be held within the pack is retained 

between the support member and the cover member, the pack 
characterised in that the distortional region is provided by 

a plurality of slits formed though the cover member, wherein 
the slits of the plurality extend both radially and 

tangentially in a direction from a centre region of the 
cover member towards an edge thereof. 
A blister pack according to claim 1 wherein the slits 
of the plurality are of non-linear shape. 
A blister pack according to claim 2 wherein the slits 
of the plurality are shaped as arcs of constant radius. 
A blister pack according to any one of the preceding 
claims wherein the distortional region provided by the 

plurality of slits is formed as a circumscribed region 
within the cover member. 
A blister pack according to any one of the preceding 
claims wherein the support member and the cover member are 

formed integrally from a single substrate. 
A blister pack according to any one of the preceding 
claims wherein when an item to be held within the pack is 

retained between the support member and the cover member, 
the distortional region of the cover distorts so as to 

substantially encapsulate the item. 
A method of forming a blister package for a saleable item 
comprises the steps of 


a) providing a support member; 
b) providing a cover member; 
c) punching or cutting a plurality of slits into the 
cover member, wherein the slits extend both radially and 

tangentially in a direction from a first region of the cover 
member outwardly thereof; 
d) locating the saleable item between the support 
member and the cover member, and beneath the first region of 

the cover member; and 
e) securing the support member and the cover member 
together.
