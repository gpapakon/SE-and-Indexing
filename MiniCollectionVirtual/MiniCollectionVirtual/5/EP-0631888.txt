<ABSTRACT>
A lockable castor for supporting a movable body, for 
example, a refuse container, comprises an element (2) for 

fixing to the movable body, and a fork (3) which supports 
a rotary wheel (7) and is articulated to the fixing element 

on a steering axis (A). A resilient brake plate (34) is 
force-fitted between two facing surfaces belonging, 

respectively, to a bracket (32) and to an appendage (33) 
formed by the partial blanking of the bracket. A central, 

axially-movable operating pin (26) cooperates with the 
resilient plate (34) to stop the rotation of the wheel (7) 

and simultaneously cooperates with a toothed disc (29) which 
engages stops formed in the cheeks (4) of the fork (3) by 

partial blanking. The fixing element (2) comprises a central 
polygonal hole (15), an axial shank (20) having a cross-section 

with a polygonal profile and a peripheral end tooth 
for the coupling and snap fitting with the central hole 

(15).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a lockable castor for
supporting a movable body.The present invention has been developed with particular
regard to a castor of the type with centralized locking
which can be fitted in particular, but not exclusively, to
a refuse container and has the main characteristics
indicated in the preamble to Claim 1 below.Normally, refuse containers have four castors of the
aforementioned type which can be locked simultaneously, for
example, by the operation of a control pedal, to prevent the
container from moving in its parked condition. For each
castor, the locking device simultaneously prevents the wheel
from rotating relative to the support fork and prevents the
fork from turning relative to the plate for connection to
the refuse container or, in general, to the movable body.A castor of the known type mentioned above is described in
German patent DE-C-40 29 299 and comprises a resilient brake
plate which is disposed in the space between the cheeks of
the support fork and one end of which engages an appendage
projecting from the fork towards the axis of rotation of the
wheel. The resilient plate is engaged by means of an
auxiliary connecting element which is also mounted on the
appendage of the fork.Another castor having the features outlined above is also
known from DE-U-9212138.The locking devices generally used provide for a control
unit which is connected to a control bar and is mounted on
the plate for fixing the castor to the container for
selectively displacing a central, axially movable operating
pin, the axis of which coincides with the steering axis of 
the castor, and the movement of which from a release
position to a locking position operates a wheel-braking
element, usually a resilient plate connected to the fork
supporting the wheel, and simultaneously operates an element
for locking the steering of the castor, usually constituted
by a device with engagement teeth which engage stop elements
fixed to the fork.Naturally, in order to lock the steering of the castor, the
control unit and the central pin must not be able to rotate
relative to the fork; in other words, the operating pin
must be locked as regards rotation relative to the movable
body and hence, in short, relative to the plate supporting
the castor, in order to prevent the stresses of the turning
of the castor in the locked condition from resulting in a
rotating force on the control unit and bending forces on the
control bar.In some known castors, the solution of welding the control
unit to the plate for
