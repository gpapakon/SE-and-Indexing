<DESCRIPTION>
 PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF SUBSTITUTED 8-AZABICYCL0[3.2. ljOCTANES The present invention concerns a process for preparing 3-cyano-8-substituted-8- azabicyclo[3.2.1]octanes. 3-Cyano-8-substituted-8-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octanes are useful as intermediates for certain insecticides (see, for example, WO 96/37494). The present invention provides a process for preparing a compound of formula (TV), wherein R1 is C alkyl, CM haloalkyl, benzyl, C3.6 alkenyl or C3_6 alkynyl (provided that the α-carbon atom of R1 is neither unsaturated nor substituted with halogen), which comprises reacting a compound of formula (III) with a source of hydroxylamine in the presence of an acid. A preferred source of hydroxylamine is hydroxylamine hydrochloride or hydroxylamine itself. Suitable acids that can be used for this reaction include organic acids (such as formic acid or acetic acid) or mineral acids (such as hydrochloric acid, nitric acid or sulphuric acid).In one particular aspect the present invention provides a process for preparing a compound of formula (TV), wherein R1 is as defined above, comprising the steps: i. ring opening a compound of formula (LI) to give a compound of formula (HI); and, ii. reacting a compound of formula (III) with a source of hydroxylamine in the presence of an acid. It is preferred that the ring opening of a compound of formula (LI) is by reacting it with a strong organic acid (such as trifluoroacetic acid). In another aspect the present invention provides a process for preparing a compound of formula (IV), wherein R1 is as defined above, comprising the steps: i. converting a compound of formula (I) to a compound of formula (LI) by a methylene insertion reaction; ii. ring opening a compound of formula (II) to give a compound of formula (ILL); and, iii. reacting a compound of formula (III) with a source of hydroxylamine in the presence of an acid. It is preferred that the compound of formula (I) is converted to a compound of formula (LI) by reacting it with a suitable sulphur ylid (such as that generated by reacting trimethylsulphoxonium iodide and an alkali metal hydride (for example sodium hydride)). Alkyl groups may be straight or branch chains are, for example, methyl ethyl, n- propyl or iso-propyl. 

 Haloalkyl is preferably alkyl optionally substituted with chlorine or fluorine and is, for example, 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl or 2,2-difluoroethyl.Alkenyl and alkynyl groups are, for example, allyl or propargyl. A compound of formula (II) can be prepared by adding a compound of formula (I) to a
