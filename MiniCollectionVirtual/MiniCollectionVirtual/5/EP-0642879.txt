<ABSTRACT>
A machine tool contains a tool changer for transferring tools (24) between a vertical-axis spindle (23) and a loading/unloading position (77) of a tool magazine. In a front elevation of the machine tool, the loading/unloading position is above the spindle (23) and laterally offset from it. Furthermore, the tool changer contains two changer arms (56, 66) which in push-pull operation in each case help to transfer a first tool (24) from the spindle (23) to the loading/unloading position (77) and a second tool (24c) from the loading/unloading position (77) to the spindle (23). The changer arms (56, 66) are each rotatable about only one axis (58, 68). Each of the changer arms (56, 66) interacts with a separate delivery position (40, 41). The two delivery positions (40, 41) are at a different distance in front of the loading/unloading position (77). Furthermore, the tool changer contains a transfer device for transferring the tools (24e) between the loading/unloading position (77) and alternatively one of the delivery positions (40, 41).
