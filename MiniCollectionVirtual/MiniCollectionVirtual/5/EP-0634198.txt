<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an installation for controlling 
the underpressure in an evaporator apparatus for treating a waste 
solution and for condensing vapours, and more in particular to an 
installation suitable for use in treating waste solutions discharged 
as a result of the processing of a photographic light-sensitive 
material. Normally, in a photographic treatment of a photographic light-sensitive 
silver halide material, a monochrome light-sensitive material 
(black-and-white photosensitive material) is fixed, and water-washed, 
whereas a colour light-sensitive material (colour photosensitive 
material) is colour-developed, bleach-fixed (or bleached and fixed), 
water-washed, and stabilised. In the photographic processing of a large quantity of light-sensitive 
materials, any component which has been consumed in a 
photographic processing is replenished. A component which has eluted 
as a result of the photographic processing or a component which has 
condensed as a result of evaporation (for example, bromide salts which 
exist in a developer and silver complex salts which exist in a fixing 
solution) is removed to keep the rate of each component of the 
processing solution to be constant, whereby the performance of the 
processing solution does not vary. In this photographic processing, 
a replenisher is supplied with the processing solution and part of the 
processing solution is wasted to remove the concentrated component. In recent years, the amount of processing solution as well as of 
water is strongly reduced in carrying out photographic processing in 
order to avoid environmental pollution and to photographically develop 
at low cost. In automatic developing machines, waste solution of a photographic 
processing is fed from a treating tank to a waste solution pipe where 
the waste solution is diluted with a coolant provided with the 
automatic developing machine, and then, wasted in sewerages. According to ordinances recently put into force, it is permitted 
to waste water and coolants used for photographic processing to 
sewerages and rivers. However, it is not permitted to discharge  
 
photographic waste solutions such as a developer, fixing solution, 
colour developer, bleach-fix solution (or bleaching solution and fixing 
solution), and stabilising agent to sewerages and rivers. An apparatus which facilitates the treatment of a photographic 
waste solution is disclosed in US-A-4,940,134, and includes a waste 
solution reservoir which is maintained at a constant level. A

<CLAIMS>
Installation (11) for controlling the underpressure in an 
evaporator apparatus for treating a waste solution, and for condensing 

the evaporated vapour, which comprises mounted in a closed circuit : 

a liquid jet hydraulic ejector (45), the suction side of which is 
connected to the evaporator apparatus (22), 
a tank (47) for collecting the ejector liquid and the condensed 
vapour from the evaporator apparatus, 
a pump (53) for pumping liquid from said tank to said hydraulic 
ejector, and 
temperature-controlling means for controlling the temperature of the 
liquid fed to said hydraulic ejector. 
Installation according to claim 1, wherein said temperature-controlling 
means comprises a radiator (54) through which the liquid 

fed to the ejector is passed, a fan (57) for cooling said radiator, 
and a temperature sensor (56) in the outlet circuit of said radiator 

for controlling the operation of said fan. 
Installation according to claim 1 or 2, wherein said tank (47) 
for collecting the ejector liquid is provided with overflow means (51) 

for draining excess liquid from said tank. 
Installation according to claim 3, which comprises a second 
tank (50) to which excess liquid is fed. 
Installation according to claim 3 or 4, wherein said tank (47) 
for collecting the ejector liquid has baffle means (49) causing a 

resistance in the liquid flow to ensure that no air bubbles would reach 
the pump (53).
