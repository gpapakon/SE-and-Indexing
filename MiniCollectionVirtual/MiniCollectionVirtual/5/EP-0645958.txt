<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a tray to contain litter for use by animals, especially domestic 
pets such as cats. There is a need for a simple and clean way of disposing of used cat 
litter but despite the attempts of numerous workers, no proposal is satisfactory. 
Usually the job of disposing of used lavatorial animal litter is messy to the point that 
people will not bother. Instead they let the pet outdoors to relieve itself. Cats, when 
let out for lavatorial purposes, are exposed to many risks and this is not to be 
recommended. In US-A-4813376 is disclosed a litter tray to contain a flexible disposable liner, the tray 
having a floor and surrounding upstanding sidewalls. Fold lines and score lines in the 
central region of opposite sidewalls together with crease lines in the floor enable the 
tray to be folded to a box configuration containing used litter inside the sealed liner. In US-A- 4706606 is disclosed a disposable litter tray that is stackable in the unused 
open condition. The base of the tray has score lines about which it may be folded for 
disposal after use. Accordingly the invention provides a disposable tray to contain litter for use by an 
animal, the tray having a floor and upstanding sidewalls and being adapted or 
arranged in use to retain its shape and being foldable to a closed condition by 
deformations in the floor, characterised in that the peripheral region of each sidewall  
 
is provided with engaging means whereby when the tray is folded about the 
deformations, the peripheral regions of opposite sidewalls can be brought into abutting 
contact whereby the tray is sealable by engagement of the respective engagement 
means. In one preferred aspect the tray is formed e.g. vacuum formed of a plastics and has thin 
walls comprising the floor and upstanding sidewalls. The tray includes deformations 
arranged to permit the tray to be folded to bring opposite sides together, 
complementary  
 
engaging means being provided whereby the abutted walls can be 
inter-engaged so sealing the tray and its contents. Because such 
a tray has thin walls it is not self supporting and the invention 
provides a box therefor, the box having a compartment 
corresponding closely in shape and size to those of the tray 
whereby the tray is snugly supported e.g. so that a cat cannot 
claw the tray away from the supporting wall. In another aspect 
the invention provides a tray having relatively rigid walls (so 
that the box can be dispensed with), the tray including flexible 
areas whereby it may be

<CLAIMS>
A disposable tray (T) to contain litter for use by an animal, the tray having a 
floor (10) and upstanding sidewalls (11) and being adapted or arranged in use to 

retain its shape and being foldable to a closed condition by deformations (13) in 
the floor (10), 
characterised in that
 the peripheral region (12) of each sidewall 
(11) is provided with engaging means (15, 16) whereby when the tray (T) is 

folded about the deformations (13), the peripheral regions (12) of opposite 
sidewalls (11) can be brought into abutting contact whereby the tray (T) is 

sealable by engagement of the respective engagement means (15, 16). 
A tray according to Claim 1, wherein the floor (10) and upstanding sidewalls 
(12) are vacuum formed of a thin plastic. 
A tray according to Claim 1 or 2, shaped to be foldable (13) along a substantially 

diagonal axis to bring facing sides (12) of the tray into abutting relation. 
A tray according to Claim 1,2 or 3, wherein the engaging means comprises 
interengageable pegs (15) and sockets (16). 
A tray according to Claim 4, wherein the pegs (15) and sockets (16) are present 
in ledges (12) present on the peripheral region of the sidewalls (11) of the tray.  

 
A tray according to Claim 5, wherein the ledge (12) includes a cut out (14) at the 
corners which lie substantially along the fold line defined by deformation (13). 
A tray according to any preceding Claim, in combination with a box (B) having a 
tray-receiving compartment (3) which corresponds in shape and size to the tray 

(T). 
A tray according the Claim 7 as dependant on Claim 6, wherein the box (B) has a 
ledge (4) on which rests the ledge (12) of the tray (T) when the tray (T) is 

received in the tray-receiving compartment (3) of the box (B).
