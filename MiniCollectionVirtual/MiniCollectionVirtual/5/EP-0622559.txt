<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a friction clutch with self adjuster within the pressure plate. For this purpose, two sheet-metal rings are arranged axially in series between the diaphragm spring (7) and the pressure plate (5). In the areas in which they face one another, these rings are supported by surface areas which have the effect of a slope, both rings being subjected to a turning moment relative to one another by means of a spring device (25).

<CLAIMS>
Friction clutch with automatic compensation for wear within the 
pressing plate (5) secured to the flywheel (2) of an internal 

combustion engine, arranged in the clutch housing (6) to rotate 
with it but to be axially displaceable, with a diaphragm
 spring (7) 
which is arranged between clutch housing (6) and pressing plate (5) 

and which abuts against the housing (6) and pressing plate (5) and 
urges the pressing plate (5) towards the flywheel (2), with a clutch 

plate (3) having friction linings (4) between pressing plate (5) and 
flywheel (2) and with an adjusting device for increasing the spacing 

between diaphragm spring and pressing plate to correspond to the 
wear of the friction linings (4) in the form of a ring element which 

is guided on a guide diameter of the pressing plate (5) concentric 
with the axis of rotation (11) of the clutch,
 
characterised in that the ring element comprises two rings 

(26, 28; 27, 29) arranged axially one beyond the other, of which 
axially one bears against the pressing plate (5) and the other against 

the spring (7) and both abut against one another in the axially 
facing regions through partial surfaces (33, 34; 35,36) forming 

circumferentially one or more ramps, and in which a spring device 
(25) is provided, pre-loading the two rings (26, 28; 27, 29) relative 

to one another and rotating them relative to one another in a sense 
such as to increase the space they take up on the occurrence of 

wear. 
Friction clutch according to claim 1,
  
 

characterised in that the partial surfaces (33, 34) of the two rings 
(27, 29) each extend continuously corresponding to the 

predetermined inclination. 
Friction clutch according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that the partial surfaces (35, 36) of the two rings 

(26, 28) comprise individual part-surfaces extending in steps, each 
parallel to a plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation (11) and 

each provided with an axial step or shoulder (37). 
Friction clutch according to one or more of claims 1 - 3,
 
characterised in that the spring device comprises at least one 

tension spring (25) which extends substantially tangentially on the 
insides of the two rings (26, 28; 27, 29) and which has one end 

hooked into an opening (24) in the one ring and the other end 
hooked into an opening (24) in the other ring. 
Friction clutch according to claim 4,
 
characterised in that the two rings (26, 28; 27, 29) are made from 

sheet metal strip. 
Friction clutch according to claim 5,
 
characterised in that both rings (27, 29) are made circumferentially 

closed. 
Friction clutch according to claim 5,
  
 

characterised in that both rings (26, 28) are made circumferentially 
open (gap 23).
