<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is related to anti-neoplastic agents and in particular to the encapsulation
of the same in liposomes which contain anti-free radical agents to reduce the toxicity of the
drug.The antibiotic doxorubicin (DXR) and its derivatives, as well as other cationic
anthracyclines currently are of great clinical interest in the treatment of cancer, including
leukemias and solid tumors.Furthermore great hopes have centered around the use of liposomes as transport
systems for bioactive agents. In these systems the drug is incorporated into the aqueous
portion of the liposomes when its hydrophilic or is distributed between the aqueous portion
and the lipidic bilayers of the liposome when the drug shows a greater lipophilic nature.
Once the drug is encapsulated, it can be administered to the patient to be treated. It has been established by various investigators that the use of liposomes for the
administration of antineoplastics in many cases improves the traditional methods of
administration, see for example: Gabizon et al.: Cancer Res. (1982) 42, 4734-4739 and
Van Hossel et al.: Cancer Res. (1984) 44, 3698-3705.It has been observed by means of the utilization of various animal models that the
encapsulation of doxorubicin in liposomes significantly reduces the secondary effects of
toxicity, both chronic and acute. See, by way of example, Rahman et al.: Cancer Res.
(1980) 40, 1532-1537, Forssen et al.: Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (1981) 78, 1873-1877,
Olson et al.: Eur. J. Cancer Clin. Oncol. (1982) 18, 167--176, Rahman et al.: "Cancer
Res. (1985) 45, 796-803 and Gabizon et al.: J. Natl. Cancer Inst. (1986) 77, 459-467.
Additionally, other indicators of toxicity, such as
alopecia, loss of weight, nausea, vomiting, and also the dermal necrosis produced by
extravasation may be reduced in significant manner by the administration of doxorubicin in
liposomes. Forssen et al.: Cancer Treat. Rep. (1983) 67, 481-484,
see also the references cited previously in this paragraph.Also, it has been established in various tumor models that this significant reduction
of the toxicity is not produced at the expense of a reduction of the anti-tumor efficacy.
Besides the references previously noted, see Rahman et al.: Chemoter, Pharmacol. (1986)
