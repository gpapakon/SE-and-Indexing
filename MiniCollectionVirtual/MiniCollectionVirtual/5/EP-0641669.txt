<ABSTRACT>
An ink jet recording method comprising the steps of : 

(1) image-wise projecting liquid, called ink, in the form of 
droplets onto a receiving material containing a substance that by 

chemically reacting with another substance contained in said 
droplets is capable of forming a visually detectable product, 

characterized in that according to a first mode said receiving 
material contains at least one substantially light-insensitive 

organic silver salt and said ink contains a reducing agent for said 
silver salt, and according to a second mode said receiving material 

contains said reducing agent and the ink contains said silver salt, 
and optionally 
(2) heating said receiving material during and/or after the 

deposition of said ink on said receiving material to start or 
enhance reduction of said silver salt(s) forming thereby image-wise 

a deposit of silver metal in said receiving material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink jet recording method and 
recording materials suited for use in said method. Thermal imaging or thermography is a recording process wherein 
images are generated by the use of imagewise modulated thermal 
energy. In thermography two approaches are known : 
1. Direct thermal formation of a visible image pattern by 
imagewise heating of a recording material containing matter that by 
chemical or physical process changes colour or optical density. 2. Thermal dye transfer printing wherein a visible image 
pattern is formed by transfer of a coloured species from an 
imagewise heated donor element onto a receptor element. Thermal dye transfer printing is a recording method wherein a 
dye-donor element is used that is provided with a dye layer 
wherefrom dyed portions or incorporated dye is transferred onto a 
contacting receiver element by the application of heat in a pattern 
normally controlled by electronic information signals. The optical density of transparencies produced by the thermal 
transfer procedure is rather low and in most of the commercial 
systems - in spite of the use of donor elements specially designed 
for printing transparencies - only reaches 1 to 1.2 (as measured by 
a Macbeth Quantalog™ Densitometer Type TD 102). However, for many 
application fields a considerably higher transmission density is 
asked for. For instance in the medical diagnostical field a maximal 
transmission density of at least 2.5 is desired. A survey of "direct thermal" imaging methods is given in the 
book "Imaging Systems" by Kurt I. Jacobson-Ralph E. Jacobson, The 
Focal Press - London and New York (1976), Chapter VII under the 
heading "7.1 Thermography". Thermography is concerned with 
materials which are not photosensitive, but are sensitive to heat or 
thermosensitive. Imagewise applied heat is sufficient to bring 
about a visible change in a thermosensitive imaging material. Most of the "direct" thermographic recording materials are of 
the chemical type. On heating to a certain conversion temperature,  
 
an irreversible chemical reaction takes place and a coloured image 
is produced. A wide variety of chemical systems has been suggested some 
examples of which have been given on page 138 of the above mentioned 
book of Kurt I. Jacobson-Ralph E. Jacobson, describing the 
production of a silver metal image by means of a thermally induced 
oxidation-reduction reaction of a silver soap with a reducing agent. According to US-P 3,080,254 a typical heat-sensitive copy

droplets onto a receiving material containing a substance that by 

chemically reacting with another substance contained in said 
droplets is capable of forming a visually detectable product and

agent is applied by ink jet printing to said receiving material from 

an ink that is colored already before deposition on said receiving 
material. 
Recording method according to claim 1, wherein inks

amounts of colorant are image-wise projected by means of a multi-nozzle
