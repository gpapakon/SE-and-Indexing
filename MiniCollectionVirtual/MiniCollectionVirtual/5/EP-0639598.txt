<ABSTRACT>
Polyaddition compounds which are solid below 40 DEG C and liquid above 125 DEG C and which contain from 0 to 2 % by weight of free isocyanate groups, from 3 to 16 % by weight of uretdione groups, from 10 to 22 % by weight of urethane groups, from 0 to 20 % by weight of carboxylate groups and from 0 to 25 % by weight of carbonate groups, with a total content of carboxylate and carbonate groups of at least 1 % by weight, a process for the preparation of these polyaddition compounds by reacting polyisocyanates containing uretdione groups, optionally in the presence of other diisocyanates, with diols containing ester groups and/or carbonate groups, optionally in the presence of diols containing no ester groups or carbonate groups, and/or compounds which are monofunctional with respect to isocyanate groups, with retention of an equivalent ratio of from 1.2:1 to 0.6:1, and the use of the polyaddition compounds for the preparation of polyurethane plastics, in particular as crosslinking agents in heat-crosslinkable two-component polyurethane powder paints (coatings).
