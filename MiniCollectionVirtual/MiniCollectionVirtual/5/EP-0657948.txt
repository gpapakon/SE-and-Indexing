<ABSTRACT>
A solar cell assembly is fabricated by adapting efficient 
microelectronics assembly techniques to the construction 

of an array of small scale solar cells (2). Each cell 
(2) is mounted on an individual carrier (4), which is a 

conventional integrated circuit (IC) package such as a dual-in-line 
package. Electrical connections are made between 

the cell (2) and the carrier leads (6) by automated 
wire bonding, followed by the emplacement of an optional 

secondary solar concentrator element (10,14) if desired. 
The carriers (4) are then automatically mounted and electrically 

connected to a common substrate (16), such as a 
printed circuit board, that has its own electrical interconnection 

network to interconnect the various cells. Finally, 
a primary concentrator lens assembly (22) is placed 

over the array of cells. The resulting panel is thin and 
light weight, inexpensive to produce, allows for any desired 

interconnection to be made between the cells, and is 
capable of high conversion efficiencies.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to concentrator solar cell modules 
and fabrication techniques, and more particularly to 
panels that use a large number of small size solar cells 
and light concentrating optics. Prior concentrator solar cell modules have generally 
employed a matrix of relatively large area solar cells, 
typically at least 12.5mm per side for a square cell. The 
cells are individually mounted by hand onto a support panel, 
with output electrical lines also hand wired. A solar 
cell assembly of this type is described in Richards, 
"Sandia's Baseline 3 Photovoltaic Concentrator Module", 
Proceedings of the 20th IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conference, 
September 25-30, 1988, pages 1318-1323. The need 
for hand assembly adds significantly to the cost of manufacture. 
In addition, during cell manufacturing a single 
point defect can spoil an entire cell, the manufacturing 
yield for the cells is also limited because of their relatively 
large size. Solar concentrator lenses that can be several hundred 
times the cell areas are mounted above the cells to concentrate 
received solar radiation onto their respective cells 
below. Since higher degrees of concentration yield higher 
conversion efficiencies, it is desirable that the concentrator  
 
lenses be kept relatively large in size. However, 
this also increases their focal lengths, requiring a depth 
on the order of a foot or more for the overall assembly. 
The large cell and lens areas result in panels that are 
relatively large and heavy; this adds to the difficulty of 
securely mounting them and especially of guiding their 
movements in a solar tracking mode. A photovoltaic assembly with smaller solar cells, on 
the order of 3mm per side, has been introduced by WattSun 
Corporation of Albuquerque, New Mexico. In this system the 
solar cells are hand bonded directly to a common copper 
substrate in a parallel circuit configuration. The concentration 
ratio is limited to about 30:1, rather than the 
desired range of several hundred to one, because the assembly 
methods employed do not allow for the high quality 
alignment of the solar cells. In addition, the WattSun 
approach does not permit the use of secondary focusing optics, 
which are necessary in systems with a light concentration 
over 100:1. The system is based upon silicon rather 
than high efficiency GaAs cells, since it is not economically 
compatible with GaAs. Thus, while the WattSun approach 
uses a larger number of smaller cells in place of 
the prior smaller number of large cells
