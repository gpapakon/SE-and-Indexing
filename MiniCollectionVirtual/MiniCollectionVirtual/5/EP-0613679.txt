Cosmetic composition which comprises a waxy 
organosiloxane, which is solid at room temperature, of 

the formula 

R
1
R
2
Si-O-SiR
2
R
1
 
in which 


R
can be identical or different and denotes an alkyl 
radical having 1 to 4 carbon atoms and 
R
1
can be identical or different and denotes a linear 
alkyl radical having at least 16 carbon atoms, 
 
a volatile organosiloxane chosen from the group comprising 

hexamethyldisiloxane, octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane, 
decamethylcyclopentasiloxane and mixtures thereof, and if 

appropriate other substances. 
Cosmetic composition according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the organosiloxane of the formula 

(I) is H

. 
Cosmetic composition according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the volatile organosiloxane is 

octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane. 
Cosmetic composition according to one or more of 
Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the weight ratio of 

solid, waxy organosiloxane of the formula (I) to volatile 
organosiloxane is 1 : 999 to 2 : 3. 
Cosmetic composition according to one or more of 
Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that it comprises a 

solid, waxy organosiloxane of the formula (I) in an 
amount of 0.1 to 40 per cent by weight, in each case 

based on the total weight of the composition according to 
the invention. 
Process for the preparation of a cosmetic 
composition according to one or more of Claims 1 to 5, 

characterized in that a waxy organosiloxane, which is 
solid at room temperature, of the formula (I) is 

dissolved in a volatile organosiloxane chosen from the 
group comprising hexamethyldisiloxane, octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane, 

decamethylcyclopentasiloxane and mixtures 
thereof, and, if appropriate, the resulting solution is 

mixed with other substances.  
 
Use of the cosmetic composition according to one 
or more of Claims 1 to 5 or which can be prepared 

according to Claim 6 for treatment of the skin.
