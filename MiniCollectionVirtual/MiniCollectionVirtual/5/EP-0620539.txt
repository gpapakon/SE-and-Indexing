<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a coin processing 
machine such as a coin wrapping machine, a coin counting 
machine or the like and, in particular, to a coin processing 
machine comprising a rotatable disk for receiving deposited 
coins and feeding out the received coins to a coin 
sorting passage by a centrifugal force produced by rotation 
thereof, the coin sorting passage having a pair of guide 
members, denomination setting means for selecting the denomination 
of the coins to be processed, and coin processing 
means for processing coins fed out to the coin sorting 
passage in accordance with the denomination selected by the 
denomination setting means. A coin processing machine such as a coin wrapping 
machine, a coin counting machine or the like is generally 
constituted so as to feed deposited coins from a rotatable 
disk to a coin sorting passage having a pair of guide members 
and drop through the spacing between the pair of guide 
members coins having a smaller diameter than that of the 
coins of the denomination to be processed, thereby to pass 
only the coins to be processed therethrough with the coins 
held between the upper surface of the coin sorting passage 
and the lower surface of a transporting belt, and to subject 
them to a predetermined processing such as counting, wrapping 
or the like. Accordingly, in such a coin processing machine, it is  
 
necessary to adjust the spacing between the pair of guide 
members, namely, the width of the coin sorting passage, so 
as to coincide with the diameter of the coins to be processed, 
and to adjust the distance between the upper surface 
of the coin sorting passage and the lower surface of the 
transporting belt so as to coincide with the thickness of 
the coins to be processed. Consequently, the coin processing 
apparatus generally includes a passage width adjusting means 
having cams for adjusting the spacing between the pair of 
guide members, and a transporting belt position adjusting 
means having cams for adjusting the distance between the 
upper surface of the coin sorting passage and the lower 
surface of the transporting belt. For example, U.S.P. No.4,219,985 discloses a coin 
processing machine which can adjust the spacing between the 
pair of guide members to coincide with the diameter of the 
coins to be processed and adjust the distance between the 
lower surface of the transporting belt and the upper surface 
of the coin sorting passage to coincide with the thickness 
of the coins to be processed by operating dials in
