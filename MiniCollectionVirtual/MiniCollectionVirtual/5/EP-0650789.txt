<ABSTRACT>
Casting roll for an installation for continuous casting of metals over one or between two such rolls, this roll including a hub (2) and a shell (3) which are arranged coaxially, means for linking the shell and the hub, comprising axially linking means, and rotary linking means, and means for support and radial centring of the shell on the hub, characterised in that the axial linking means include axial stop means (4) for the shell on the hub, which are located in a substantially axially median plane P of the roll, and the centring means include means (34, 51, 35, 61) for elastic conical centring solely of the edges of the shell with respect to the hub. The invention applies particularly to casting cylinders for continuous casting beween rolls of thin metal strips, particularly made from steel.

Casting roll for a plant for continuous casting
of metals on or between two rolls of this type, this roll

including a hub (2) and a shell (3) which are arranged
coaxially, means for connecting the shell and the hub,

comprising axial connection means and rotational connection
means, and means for supporting and radially

centring the shell on the hub,

   characterized in that the axial connection means
include means (4) for axial abutment of the shell on the

hub, which means are located in a plane (P) which is
substantially axially central to the roll, and the

centring means include means (34, 51, 35, 61) for elastic
conical centring solely of the edges of the shell with

respect to the hub.
Roll according to Claim 1, characterized in that
the means for conical centring include two flanges (5, 6)

which are centred and slide on the hub (2), each flange

including a frustoconical part (51, 61) which cooperates
with a bore (34, 35) of frustoconical general shape

formed on the corresponding edge of the shell (3), and
elastic means (71, 73, 74) for moving the two flanges

towards each other.
Roll according to Claim 2, characterized in that
the means for moving the flanges towards each other

comprise elastic means (71, 73, 74), independent of the
hub and the shell, for connecting the two flanges.
Roll according to Claim 1, characterized in that
the roll includes pressure means (28, 81) for exerting an

axial force on the abutment means (4). 
Roll according to Claim 1, characterized in that
the abutment means (4) include a hub shoulder (24)

bearing on a shell shoulder (33).
Roll according to Claim 4, characterized in that
the pressure means include an elastic bracket (28) and an

insert (81) which is placed between the shell (3) and the
hub (2) and is applied by the said bracket (28) against

a shoulder (36) on the opposite side from the shoulder
(33).
Roll according to Claim 6, characterized in that
the insert (81) is segmented by a plurality of

independent thrust parts (82) placed in longitudinal
grooves made at the interface between the shell and the

hub.
Roll according to Claim 1, characterized in that
the flanges (5, 6) are connected in rotation to the hub

(2).
Roll according to Claim 1, characterized in that,
when cold, at least one of the conical surfaces (34, 51)

in contact with the shell (3) and the flanges (5, 6) has,
at the front ends of the shell, a relief (37) formed in

such a way that, at this relief, the said conical surfaces
are spaced apart from each other.
Roll according to Claim 3, characterized in that
the means for elastic connection of the flanges (5, 6)

comprise tie rods (71) and elastic elements (74).
