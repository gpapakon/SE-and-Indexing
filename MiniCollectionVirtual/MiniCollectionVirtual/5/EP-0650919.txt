<ABSTRACT>
Upper wires (28) 
are provided between a base 

(12) and the hook (31a) of a 
crane (31), and lower wires 

(32) the base end portions 
of which are secured to the 

base are engaged with lifting 
member locking portions 

(11a) of a large-weight 
object (11), rings (32a) 

at the upper ends of the 
lower wires (32) being fitted 

around a mast (17) provided 
upright on the base. A slider 

(18) fitted slidably around 
the mast is pushed up by 

a first resilient member so 
that the upper end of the 

slider is flush with at least 
that of the mast in a no-load 

condition a slider lowering 
means (33) overcoming the 

resilient force of the first 
resilient member to lower 

the slider. A locking means 
temporarily fixes the slider 

lowering means with the 
slider in a lowered state, 

and an unlocking means 
disengages the locking 

means. The lower lifting 
members can be removed 

automatically from the large-weight object lowered to a predetermined place. A large-weight object of any shape can 
be lifted and lowered to a predetermined place without damaging the tension members, and an operation for hanging 

tension members on a hook of a crane becomes unnecessary.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for dismounting a
hoisting member such as a wire, cable, rope, or chain hoisting a
heavy load, from the heavy load.After a heavy load such as a construction material used for
construction works or civil engineering works is raised by a
crane by using a hoisting member such as a wire and unloaded at a
predetermined place, the wire engaged with the heavy load is
normally disengaged by a worker.However, when the predetermined place is under water such as
erection or repair of a breakwater or bank and therefore a work
cannot easily approach the place, the wire is left at the place
together with a heavy load such as a net case containing stones
(for example, refer to Examined Published Japanese Patent
Application No. 51-12322).However, to arrange a lot of heavy loads such as net cages
containing stones at a seashore or pier in the case of the above
work, leaving of a wire whose unit cost is approx. 10,000 yen for
each heavy load increases the construction cost. Therefore, the
wire is dismounted by a diver under water. However, because it
is not easy to dismount it depending on the meteorological
condition or installed condition of the heavy loads, it has been
desired to improve the dismounting operation.To solve the above problems, the applicant of this invention
applied for a patent (Unexamined Published Japanese Patent
Application No. 3-73986) of a dismounting device for a heavy load 
hoisting member, in which an upper hoisting member is set between
a base and a crane hook, a lower hoisting member whose foundation
end is set to the base is engaged with a heavy-load hoisting
member engagement portion and whose front-end ring is fitted into
a mast erected on the base, and a slider slidably fitted into the
mast is pushed up by a resilient body so that the top of the
slider fits at least the top of the mast under loadless state and
moreover slider lowering means lowers the slider by overcoming
the resilient force of the resilient body while the base is
raised.When the slider lowering means is a weight suspended by the
slider through a suspension member, the ring at the front end of
the lower hoisting member fitted into the mast is completely
removed from the mast after a hoisted heavy load is downed at a
predetermined place and the weight is mounted on the heavy load,
and moreover the base lowers by a predetermined distance. By
raising the base by a crane under the above state, the lower
hoisting member is removed from the heavy-load hoisting member
engagement portion.
