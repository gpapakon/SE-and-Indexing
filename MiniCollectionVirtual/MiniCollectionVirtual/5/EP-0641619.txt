<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for the punching and angular cutting of metal workpieces, in particular flat-steel and sectional bars, having a machine frame, slide, table and working-cylinder/piston arrangement which acts on the slide and defines with its axis the vertical working axis of this tool unit. The tool-holder mounting for the punching tool holder is located on the underside of a slide component projecting from the slide and is provided with a quick-change device. The punching tool works in the vertical working axis of the tool unit. The tool-holder mounting for the angular-cutting tool holder is located in a position offset by 90 DEG from the tool-holder mounting for the punching tool holder under this tool-holder mounting and is likewise provided with a quick-change device. The angular-cutting tool works subsequent to the vertical as well as in the area of the vertical working axis. A common tool jaw is allocated to the punching tool and the angular-cutting tool. The quick-change devices enable the angular-cutting tool with its angular-cutting tool holder to be exchanged when the punching work is being carried out and enable the punching tool with its punching tool holder to be exchanged when angular-cutting work is being carried out.
