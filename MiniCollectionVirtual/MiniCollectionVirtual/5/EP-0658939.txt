<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a voltage-driven
thyristor, and in particular to a voltage-driven thyristor
having superior turn-on and turn-off characteristics as
well as high reliability.as is known, voltage-driven thyristors are a kind of
switch elements. An example of the voltage driven
thyristor is disclosed in IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRON
DEVICES, Vol. ED33, No. 10, October 1986.Fig. 24 shows a section of the voltage-driven
thyristor disclosed in the above reference. Referring to
Fig. 24, an n-buffer layer 102 is formed on a p+-anode
layer 101. An anode electrode 112 is formed on the bottom
surface of the p+-anode layer 101. An n--base layer 103 is
formed on the n-buffer layer 102.P-base layers 104 are formed selectively on the
surface of n--base layer 103. An n+-cathode layer 106 and
n-cathode layers 105 are formed on each p-base layer 104.
n-cathode layers 105 are located at opposite sides of the
n+-cathode layer 106. On n-cathode layers 105 are formed 
p+-impurity layers 107 which are also located at opposite
sides of n+-cathode layer 106.Surface layers of the p-base layer 104 form first
channel forming regions 113 of a n-channel MOS transistor,
which will be described later. A surface layer of the n-cathode
layer 105 adjacent to the first channel forming
region 113 forms a second channel forming region 114 of an
p-channel MOS transistor, which will be described later.A gate electrode 109 is formed on the first and
second channel forming regions 113 and 114 with a gate
oxide film 108 therebetween. Thus, the gate electrode
109, p-base layer 104 and p+-impurity layer 107 form a p-channel
MOS transistor, of which channel forming region is
the second channel forming region 114. The gate electrode
109, n--base layer 103 and n-cathode layer 105 form the n-channel
MOS transistor, of which channel forming region is
the first channel forming region 113.The gate electrode 109 is covered with a cap oxide
film 110. Cap oxide film 110 is covered with a cathode
electrode 111 which are in contact with n+-cathode layer
106 and p+-impurity layers 107.Then, an operation of the conventional voltage-driven
thyristor having the above structure will be described
below with reference to Fig. 25, which shows an operation
principle of the voltage-driven thyristor shown in Fig. 
24. Referring to Fig. 25, a pnp transistor Tr1 is formed
of p+-anode layer 101, n--base layer 103, n-buffer layer
102 and p-base layer 104. An npn transistor Tr2 is formed
of n--base layer 103, p-base layer 104 and n+-cathode layer
