<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to automatic
processors for processing photosensitive material and
is more particularly concerned with slot impingement
for use with such processors.The processing of photosensitive material
involves a series of steps such as developing,
bleaching, fixing, washing, and drying. These steps
lend themselves to mechanization by conveying a
continuous web of film or cut sheets of film or
photographic paper sequentially through a series of
stations or tanks, each one containing a different
processing liquid appropriate to the process step at
that station.There are various sizes of photographic film
processing apparatus, i.e., large photofinishing
apparatus and microlabs. A large photofinishing
apparatus utilizes tanks which contain approximately
100 liters of each processing solution. A small
photofinishing apparatus or microlab utilizes tanks
which may contain less than 10 liters of processing
solution.The chemicals contained in the processing
solution: cost money to purchase; change in activity
and are seasoned by the constituents of the
photosensitive material which leach out during the
photographic process; and after the chemicals are used
the chemicals must be disposed of in an
environmentally safe manner. Thus, it is important in
all sizes of photofinishing apparatus to reduce the
volume of processing solution. The prior art suggests
various types of replenishing systems which add or
subtract specific chemicals to the processing solution 
to maintain a consistency of photographic
characteristics in the material developed. It is
possible to maintain reasonable consistency of
photographic characteristics only for a certain period
of replenishment. After a processing solution has
been used a given number of times, the solution is
discarded and a new processing solution is added to
the tank.Activity degradation due to instability of
the chemistry, or chemical contamination, after the
components of the processing solution are mixed
together causes one to discard the processing solution
in smaller volume tanks more frequently than larger
volume tanks. Some of the steps in the photographic
process utilize processing solutions which contain
chemicals that are unstable, i.e., they have a short
process life. Thus, processing solutions in tanks
which contain unstable chemicals are discarded more
frequently than processing solutions in tanks that
contain stable chemicals.EP-A-0424824 is directed to a photographic
apparatus wherein a photosensitive material is passed
through a plurality of
