<ABSTRACT>
A method of determining the critical vapor pressure of a hygroscopic material, such as a drug. A drug sample is placed in a substantially isothermal environment. A vapor, such as water vapor, at a given pressure is then placed in the ambient air over the drug. The rate of heat production from this sample at the given water vapor pressure, or the humidity of the air above the sample, is then measured. The water vapor pressure over the drug is gradually increased. Simultaneously, the rate of increase in heat production from the drug sample, or the rate of change of the relative humidity of the air above the drug sample, is measured. A marked increase in the rate of heat production generated by the drug, or a marked change in the relative humidity of the air over the sample, signals the attainment of the critical water vapor pressure.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of
determining the critical vapor pressure of a hygroscopic material,
e.g. for rapidly
determining the critical water vapor pressure of a drug.
In this way, drug manufacturers may package or store that
drug in an environment designed to ensure that the
critical water vapor pressure will not be reached.Many hygroscopic materials, such as
pharmaceuticals, superabsorbents, plant tissues, polymers
and agricultural chemicals, may be harmed through contact
with atmospheric moisture. In the case of
pharmaceuticals, both the nonactive excipients and the
active drugs are subject to physical property change,
degradation or phase change when exposed to adverse,
relatively high moisture environments. Thus,
pharmaceutical manufacturers must know the conditions
under which each particular pharmaceutical will and will
not degrade. Knowing these conditions, manufacturers can
use the least expensive packaging materials available
that are able to ensure that such adverse conditions will
not occur.For example, a particular inexpensive foil seal
for a bottle opening may have a known permeability. That
permeability may be sufficiently low to ensure that
environmental moisture could not increase the water vapor
pressure in that bottle to a level near or above the
critical water vapor pressure of a given drug. In such
a case, the manufacturer would be confident in using this
foil seal, rather than a more expensive seal having a
lower permeability.Currently, the critical water vapor pressure of
pharmaceuticals is measured by time-consuming methods.
Typically, these methods require weeks or months to 
complete. Examples of currently used methods for
determining the critical water vapor pressure are
described in W.A. Strickland, Jr., "Study Of Water Vapor
Sorption By Pharmaceutical Powders," J. Pharmaceutical
Sciences, 51, (1962) 310-314, and in B.B. Michniak-Mikolajczak,
B.W. Barry and L.L. Walker, "A Microbalance
Technique For Measuring Water Vapour Uptake And Release
By Stratum Corneum In Vitro," International J. of
Pharmaceutics, 31, (1986) 247-259.In the case of agricultural chemicals, such as
fertilizers, exceeding the critical water vapor pressure
can result in a conversion of that fertilizer from a
granular, free-flowing substance to a caked, agglomerated
substance. This causes obvious difficulties in handling
and application of the fertilizer.The invention is a method of determining the
critical vapor pressure of a drug or any other
hygroscopic material, including, but not limited to,

A method of determining the critical vapor pressure of a
hygroscopic material, said method comprising placing said hygroscopic

material in an isothermal environment;

   characterised by slowly increasing the vapor pressure over said
hygroscopic material, and measuring the rate of heat production by said

hygroscopic material until the rate of heat production generated by said
hygroscopic material increases markedly to signal attainment of the critical

vapor pressure.
A method of determining the critical water vapor pressure of a
hygroscopic material, said method comprising placing said hygroscopic

material in an isothermal environment;

   characterised by slowly increasing, in a relatively constant manner,
the relative humidity of a gas into a container which contains said

hygroscopic material, and measuring the relative humidity of the gas
directly above the hygroscopic material until the rate of increase of the

relative humidity of the gas directly above the hygroscopic material
changes markedly, said marked change signalling attainment of the critical

water vapor pressure.
A method of determining the critical vapor pressure of a
hygroscopic material, said method comprising placing said hygroscopic

material in an isothermal environment,

   characterised by:

a) establishing a constant vapor pressure, over said hygroscopic
material;
b) placing said hygroscopic material at a temperature above a
given temperature T; 
c) slowly lowering the temperature of the hygroscopic material
until the temperature of the hygroscopic material reaches the temperature

T;
d) recording the heat output from the hygroscopic material
while lowering its temperature; and
e) plotting the hygroscopic material heat output versus the
hygroscopic material temperature;

   the intersection of the two branches of the resulting curve
corresponding to the temperature, Tc, at which the vapor pressure over

the hygroscopic material corresponds to the critical vapor pressure of the
sample of hygroscopic material,

results in a new constant vapour pressure over said hygroscopic material;

said temperature of said hygroscopic material is known.

hygroscopic material is lowered at a rate of 1-7°C per hour.
The method of Claim 1 or 2 wherein said slow increase in the
vapor pressure is effected by linear continuous increases in vapor

pressure.
The method of any one of Claims 1, 2 or 5 wherein said slow increase
in the vapor pressure is effected by incremental increases in vapor

pressure. 
The method of any preceding claim, wherein said hygroscopic
material is a drug.
The method of any one of Claims 1 to 6, wherein said hygroscopic
material is an agricultural fertilizer.
