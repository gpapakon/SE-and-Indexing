<ABSTRACT>
A pressed laminate (1) has a core (3) comprising a stack of core papers (3) impregnated with phenol-formaldehyde resin, and at least one outer paper (4) impregnated with melamine-formaldehyde resin, which are pressed together under pressure and heat. The core (3) has an intermediate layer (5) of highly tear-resistant woven fabric, which is bonded on both sides to the neighbouring core papers (2) by a chemical reaction. The intermediate layer (5) is coated on both sides with thermoplastic polyether-polyurethane or polyester-polyurethane.
