<ABSTRACT>
A method of combining first and second 
self-expanding stents to form a stent assembly for 

insertion into a body passageway by:
 

   forming first and second stents each from 
a continuous first length of wire formed into a 

closed zig-zag configuration having an endless 
series of straight sections joined at their ends by 

a plurality of bends, the second stent having bends 
at one end defining eyes open at the straight 

sections of the second stent,
 

   engaging the eyes at one end of the second 
stent about bends at one end of the first stent and 

closing the eyes.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to stents and, in particular,
the invention relates to modifications to the
Gianturco Expandable Wire Stent.It is desirable in various situations to provide means
for expanding a constricted vessel portion or for
maintaining an open passageway through a vessel
portion. Such situations arise, for example, in
conjunction with arteriosclerosis that restricts or
stops blood flow through a vessel, or in conjunction
with diseases of the prostrate gland which restrict or
stop flow through the urethra.A percutaneous stent developed by Dr. Cesare Gianturco
is formed of a stainless steel wire arranged in a
closed, zig-zag pattern, as more fully described in US
Patent No. 4,580,568. The Gianturco stent, or the Z-stent
as it is also known, is compressed into a
reduced size shape with an outer diameter which is
many times smaller than its outer diameter in an
expanded shape. The stent is positioned in a
passageway by means of a sheath while the stent is
retained in the compressed reduced size shape. A
pusher or flat-ended catheter is used through the
sheath to hold the stent in place in the passageway 
while the sheath is withdrawn, thereby allowing the
stent to expand in the passageway into its expanded
shape to hold the passageway open and enlarged. Thus,
the Z-stent provides a self-expanding means for
maintaining an open passageway.Fig. 6 of the above referenced US-A-4 580 568
illustrates the use of the well-known Z-stent
wire within a body passageway.Fig. 7 of the above referenced US-A-4 580 568
illustrates the use of several Z-stents along a
limited length of a body passageway. In illustrated
arrangement, two stents are situated in an overlapping
arrangement, while a third stent is disposed slightly
downstream from the other two stents. As discussed
more fully in the above-referenced Gianturco '568
patent, each of the three stents must be separately
inserted using the sheath and pusher described above.Since the initial development of the expandable wire
Z-stent, it has been discovered that over time a Z-stent
may continue to expand to its maximum diameter
even though it was originally deployed in a passageway
that had a diameter somewhat smaller than the maximum
outer diameter of the expanded stent. Thus, the end
result has been in some cases that the stent becomes
embedded deeply into the walls of the passageway. In
an effort to address this particular problem, others 
in the art have modified the expandable Z-stent to
form eyes at the bends or joints of the zig-zag
configuration. A

<CLAIMS>
A method of combining a first and second
self-expanding stent to form a stent assembly for

insertion into a body passageway comprising the steps
of:


forming a first stent from a continuous first
length of wire (11') formed into a closed zig-zag

configuration having an endless series of straight
sections joined at their ends by a plurality of bends

(14');
forming a second stent from a continuous
second length of wire (11'') formed into a closed zig-zag

configuration having an endless series of straight
sections joined at their ends by a plurality of bends

(14''), the bends at one end defining eyes open at the
straight sections of the second stent;

   characterised by engaging the eyes at the one
end of the second stent about bends at one end of the

first stent; and
closing the eyes at the one end of the second
stent.
The method of claim 1 wherein:

the step of forming the first stent includes
forming eyes (20') at the one end of the first stent,

the eyes open at the straight sections of the first 
stent; and
the step of engaging the eyes (20'') at one
end of the second stent includes interlocking the eyes

of the second stent with the eyes of the first stent
and closing the eyes at the one end of the first

stent.
