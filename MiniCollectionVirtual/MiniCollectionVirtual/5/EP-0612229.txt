<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a soft tissue prosthesis which is formed from a three-dimensional braided structure having an inner surface (22) and an outer surface (24). The three-dimensional braided structure preferably may be made in the form of a solid three-dimensional braid, a three-dimensional braid having at least one interlocking yarn coupling contiguous layers or in the form of a plurality of two-dimensional braided layers adhesively laminated, separately sewn or otherwise connected together to form the three-dimensional braided prosthesis.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a braided soft
tissue prosthesis and, more particularly, to a soft tissue
prosthesis formed from a three-dimensional braided
structure.Vascular grafts are commonly used as soft tissue
prostheses to replace damaged or diseased veins and
arteries. To maximize the effectiveness of any prostheses
it is desirable that it have characteristics which closely
resemble that of the natural body lumen.One particular problem which is encountered is that
of thrombosis. Thrombosis, or clotting, occurs when an
individual's blood contacts a foreign body. As the blood
begins to deposit platelets on the foreign body, a
thrombus or blood clot forms. Historically, grafts having
a relatively large diameter (greater than 10 mm) have
generally proved successful over the long term because the
build-up of thrombus that occurs on the interior surface
of the graft is not sufficient to substantially obstruct
the flow of blood. However, with respect to grafts having
a diameter less than 10 mm, the build-up of thrombus on
the interior surface of the graft can result in a complete
obstruction of the graft in a relatively short period of
time.Presently, conventional tubular prostheses and, more
specifically, vascular grafts formed by weaving or
knitting synthetic fibers into a tubular structures, are
susceptible to kinking or collapsing under varying
circumstances, e.g., when the graft is bent during the
contraction of surrounding muscle, or when external
pressure is applied to the graft. One conventional
solution to these problems has focused on the 
reinforcement of the walls of the vascular graft through
the use of helically wrapped reinforcing fibers,
reinforcing rings or bands placed externally around the
tubular structure. The additional reinforcement of the
tubular structure generally has the disadvantage of
reducing the radial and/or longitudinal compliance of the
graft due to the stiffness of the reinforcing member. A
non-compliant graft may reduce the blood flow through the
graft, thereby compromising the ability of the prosthesis
to perform naturally. Additionally, the reinforcing
member generally cannot be penetrated by cellular ingrowth
from surrounding tissue and may cause the erosion of the
surrounding tissue during contraction.Another important characteristic associated with soft
tissue prostheses is that of porosity. Preferably, the
exterior surface of the prosthesis should include pores
which are large enough to allow for the entry of
connective tissue into the outer periphery of the
