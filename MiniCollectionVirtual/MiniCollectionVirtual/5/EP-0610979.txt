<ABSTRACT>
An engine output shaft and a transmission torque 
converter (11) are connected for torque transmission 

therebetween. A flex plate (13) is disposed between, and 
secured for rotation with either, the output shaft or the 

torque converter input shell (41). The flex plate 
includes an axially extending rim (33) frictionally 

engaged with an annular wall (31) secured either to the 
output shaft or the torque converter input shell. A 

clamp member (45) surrounds the rim on the flex plate 
radially outward of the annular wall and is selectively 

tightened to establish a force therein to cause the 
frictional engagement to be sufficient to transmit the 

torque.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a drive 
connection between an engine output member and a 
transmission input member as disclosed e.g. in document GB-A-1 123 093. A drive connection between an engine and torque 
converter incorporates a flex plate to accommodate 
misalignment between the centrelines of the engine and 
the transmission as well as movement due to hydraulic 
forces in the torque converter. The flex plate is 
typically connected by threaded fasteners to both the 
engine crankshaft and lugs welded to the torque converter 
input shell. It is customary alternative to employ 
threaded fasteners connected to both the engine flywheel 
and a flange on the torque converter. In either event, 
the flex plate is bolted to one member prior to joining 
the engine and transmission. To assemble the units, they 
are aligned and a nose on the torque converter is slid 
into a bushing, or pilot, in the engine crankshaft. The 
other connection is then made by inserting a bolt through 
an access aperture and threading it to an opening in the 
proper unit. The engine and transmission must then be 
rotated on their respective axes until another threaded 
opening is presented to the access aperture so another 
bolt may be threaded in position. This process is 
continued until twelve or more bolts are installed and 
properly tightened. This is a time consuming process. 
Moreover, the process is subject to errors in that a bolt 
can be omitted, not completely tightened or cross 
threaded. In fact, this assembly process may require the 
need for two employees on a paced assembly line. The 
disadvantages are compounded every time it is necessary 
to disassemble the connection for repairs or inspections. An alternative is to provide a slide-together 
assembly in the form of a spline or toothed connection. 
With slide-together interfaces, the engine flywheel and a  
 
flange on the torque converter are mated at assembly. 
The drive interface is maintained by the securement 
between the housings. However, due to the amount of 
movement caused by misalignment and/or hydraulic forces 
in the torque converter, a dry spline or toothed 
connection does not meet the durability requirements for 
commercial, on-highway vehicles. Thus, this type 
connection tends to require lubrication. As a result, 
these drive interfaces have been limited to off-highway 
and track-laying types of vehicles where continual 
maintenance is employed. It is, therefore, an object of the present 
invention to provide an improved drive connection

<CLAIMS>
A drive connection between an engine output 
member and a transmission input member (41), the drive 

connection comprising a flex plate (13) having an inner 
hub portion (34) secured for rotation with one of the 

engine output member or the transmission input member; 
characterised by an outer axially extending, annular rim 

(33) on the flex plate; by an annular drive wall (31) 
disposed on the other of the engine output member or the 

transmission input member disposed radially inwardly of 
and circumferentially abutting the rim; and by clamp 

means (45) having an annular band portion (54) disposed 
circumjacent the rim, and tightening means (47,47A) for 

tightening the annular band portion about the rim for 
frictionally securing the rim with the annular drive 

wall. 
A drive connection as claimed in claim 1, 
wherein the rim (33) has axially spaced lip (63) and 

finger (65) portions to position the annular band portion 
(54) axially on the rim. 
A drive connection as claimed in claim 1 or 
claim 2, wherein the annular band portion (54) has spaced 

open ends (51,53); and the tightening means (47A) has a 
threaded member (50) operatively connected with one of 

the open ends, a receptacle (48) operatively connected 
with the other of the open ends, and means (55) 

threadably engaging the threaded member and co-operating 
with the receptacle for drawing the open ends toward each 

other. 
A drive connection as claimed in any one of 
claims 1 to 3, wherein the flex plate (13) includes an 

outer portion (58) defined by a plurality of segments 
(64) presenting radially oriented slots (61) at the 

annular rim (33) to permit radial contraction of the rim 
during tightening of the tightening means (47,47A).
