<ABSTRACT>
In a computer system in which a plurality of computers are linked 
together, a host computer runs an application program which can be operated by 

the remote computers. A window in the display of each computer is controlled 
to display the same image.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to operating a plurality of interlinked computers.Modern telephone systems allow multiple parties at different locations to hold
a conference. However, telephone conferences do not provide all of the conveniences
of a face-to-face conference, where participants all meet at a common table in a
meeting room. For example, in a meeting room, participants can view an object of
interest, such as a drawing or a product. Such viewing is not possible in a telephone
conference.US-A-5l19 discloses a computer collaboration system wherein changes to
the display made by a user at a local terminal are entered on the display screens at all
terminals at substantially the same time. Each user can therefore interact with the
local display and with other users through the display without having to wait for one
user to complete his entry of information.It is the object of the invention to provide an improved electronic
conferencing system.Therefore, according to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a
computer conferencing system including
   a host computer running an application program;
   one or more remote computers linked to the host computer, and
   control means adapted to allow remote computers to modify the display of the
host computer and to cause the display of the host computer to be replicated on the
remote computers, characterized in that the computers are selectably operable in an
application mode or an annotation mode and where in the application mode, the host
computer only relays display data to the remote computers.According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a
method of operating a computer conferencing system including a host computer
running an application program and one or more remote computers linked to the host
computer, comprising the steps of allowing allow remote computers to modify the
display of the host computer; replicating the display of the host computer on the 
remote computers, characterized in that the computers are selectably operable in an
application mode or a annotation mode and in that in an application mode, the host
computer only relays display data to the remote computersOne embodiment of the present invention will now be described by way of
example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:-
Figure 1 illustrates three computers, connected by telephone lines.Figure 2 initiates an example, which will be elaborated in Figures 3-14.
In the example, a calculator program is operated, and annotated, by

<CLAIMS>
A computer conferencing system including

   a host computer running an application program;

   one or more remote computers linked to the host computer, and

   control means adapted to allow remote computers to modify the display of the
host computer and to cause the display of the host computer to be replicated on the

remote computers, 
characterized in that
 the computers are selectably operable in an
application mode or an annotation mode and where in the application mode, the host

computer only relays display data to the remote computers.
A computer conferencing system according to claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 in an annotation mode, a user can annotate the display of the user's computer, the
annotations being replicated on the other computers of the system by display data

being relayed from the user's computer to the other computers.
A computer system according to claim I, 
characterized in that
 said
control means is adapted to ascertain which graphics commands are currently being

processed in the host computer, and to cause execution of each ascertained graphics
command in the remote computers.
A computer system according to claim 1 or claim 2, 
characterized in that

said control means is adapted: to identify remote graphics operations occurring on the
displays of the remote computers; to notify the host computer of the identified

graphics operations; and to replicate the remote graphics operations on the display of
the host computer.
A computer system according to any one of the preceding claims,

characterized in that
 the replicated displays are located in windows, such that one
window in each computer display displays the same image. 
A method of operating a computer conferencing system including a host
computer running an application program and one or more remote computers linked

to the host computer, comprising the steps of allowing allow remote computers to
modify the display of the host computer; replicating the display of the host computer

on the remote computers, 
characterized in that
 the computers are selectably operable
in an application mode or a annotation mode and 
in that
 in an application mode, the
host computer only relays display data to the remote computers.
A method of operating a computer conferencing system according to
claim 6, 
characterized in that
 in an annotation mode, a user can annotate the display
of the user's computer, the annotations being replicated on the other computers of the

system by display data being relayed from the user's computer to the other
computers.
A method according to claim 6, 
characterized by
 the steps of:

maintaining a plurality of similar graphics commands in each computer; and,
as graphics commands are executed by one of the computers, identifying each

command and causing each remote computer to execute a similar command.
