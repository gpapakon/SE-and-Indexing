<ABSTRACT>

compound of the general formula (2): 


wherein R¹ and R² are independently hydrogen, halogen, hydroxy, C₁-C₅ alkyl, C₁-C₅ 
alkoxy, nitro or a group of the RCONH wherein R is C₁-C₂₀ alkyl, phenyl, phenyl-substituted 

(C₁-C₂₀)alkyl, phenyl(C₁-C₂₀)alkoxyphenyl or (C₁-C₂₀)alkoxyphenyl. This 
production process is characterized in that a carboxamide of the general formula (1): 


wherein R¹ and R² are each as defined above, is reacted with a dehydrating agent in the 
presence of a pyridine compound of the general formula (4): 


wherein A¹ and A² are independently hydrogen or C₁-C₅ alkyl. If the final product 
cannot be obtained as crystals having good filtration properties by ordinary treatments, a 

novel technique as disclosed herein can provide such crystals by dissolving the reaction 
product in an organic solvent insoluble or slightly soluble in water; pouring the resultant 

solution into water; and removing the organic solvent by distillation with stirring to effect 
the crystallization of the final product.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an industrially favorable process of producing
2-cyano-4-oxo-4H-benzopyran compounds which can be used as intermediates for the
production of some kinds of 2-(tetrazol-5-yl)-4-oxo-4H-benzopyran derivatives. It has
been known that these derivatives exhibit at least partial competition with one or more of
leukotrienes, particularly leukotrienes C and D, and therefore have pharmacologically
effective characteristics (see, e.g., Prostaglandins, Leukotrienes, Essent. Fatty Acids,
48(3), 241, 1993).
Processes for producing 2-cyano-4-oxo-4H-benzopyran compounds
are disclosed for example in references DE-A-2 105 191 and
FR-A-2 208 674As process of producing 2-cyano-4-oxo-4H-benzopyran compounds, for
example, there has been known a process using 2-hydroxyacetophenone compounds as
the starting material (see, e.g., Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 1972, Vol.15, No.8,
865), which is shown in the following reaction scheme:
In the above process, however, since an alcohol is used as solvent in the
second and third steps, and ammonia is used in the third step, serious problems will occur
that a great amount of waste water containing the alcohol in a high concentration or containing
ammonia has to be discharged in the production on an industrial scale. In the fourth step, ordinary conditions for the dehydration of carboxamides
are used; for example, (a) phosphorus oxychloride, phosphorus pentoxide or the like
is used as the dehydrating agent and DMF, pyridine or a mixture thereof is used as the
solvent; or (b) phosgene is used as the dehydrating agent and a hydrocarbon such as
dichloromethane or dichloroethane is used as the solvent.However, the conditions (a) have a disadvantage in that complicated procedures
are necessary for the removal of the solvent from the waste water because DMF or
pyridine used as the solvent is soluble in water and such a solvent gives a high load on the
waste water. Also the conditions (b) are not always satisfactory for the production on an
industrial scale because relatively high temperatures are required therefor.In the above reaction scheme, it has been known that the following side
reaction will be caused in the process (v) which is conducted by way of acid chlorides.
If the substituent R1 or R2 in the general formula (1) as shown below is a benzoylamino group
substituted with an alkoxy group, there is required a step of reacting an acid halide of the
general formula (12):
