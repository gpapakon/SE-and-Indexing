<ABSTRACT>
The use of 0-esters of L-carnitine with saturated 
bicarboxylic acids (e.g. azelaic, sebacic, suberic and 

pimelic acid) or unsaturated monocarboxylic acids (e.g. 
linoleic, linolenic, oleic and orachidonic acid)
 is 
disclosed for producing pharmaceutical compositions 

suitable to be topically applied for treating 
dermatoses, such as ichthyosis and psoriasis.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of O-esters of
L-carnitine for producing pharmaceutical compositions
containing such esters as active ingredients, suitable
to be topically applied for the treatment of dermatoses.
These esters have the formula (I)

wherein
R is the acyl group of
(a) a saturated bicarboxylic acid, or(b) an unsaturated monocarboxylic acid, and
X- is the anion of a pharmacologically acceptable
acid.Specifically, the esters which are particularly
preferred are those wherein acid (a) is selected from
azelaic acid, sebacic acid, suberic acid and pimelic
acid, and those wherein acid (b) is selected from 
arachidonic acid.Encompassed by the esters to be used according to the
present invention are also the inner salts of the
compounds of the formula (I). In the inner salts the
quaternary nitrogen atom will be salified by the
carnitine carboxyl group or, possibly, when R is the
acyl group of a bicarboxylic acid (a), by the free
carboxyl group of the acid.Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compound of
formula (I) include, in addition to the inner salts, all
pharmaceutically acceptable salts which are prepared by
the addition of acid to L-carnitine, and which do not
give rise to undesirable toxic or collateral effects.
The formation of pharmaceutically acceptable acid
addition salts is well known in pharmaceutical
technology.Non-limiting examples of suitable salts include the
chloride, bromide, orotate, acid aspartate, acid
citrate, acid phosphate, fumarate, acid fumarate,
lactate, maleate, acid maleate, acid oxalate, acid
sulfate, glucose phosphate, tartrate and acid tartrate
salts.The esters of the formula (I) wherein the acyl group is
derived from the previously listed acids (a) and (b),
are known compounds. Particularly: 
the esters therein the acyl group is derived from acids
(a) are disclosed e.g. in US patent 4,401,827 therein
their therapeutical utility for treating cardiac
disturbances, hyperlipoedemias and hyperlipoproteinemic
is also disclosed;
the esters wherein the acyl group is derived from acids(b) are disclosed e.g. in Biochim. Biophys. Acta 260,
515-526 (1972).In Drugs under experimental and clinical research, vol. 17,5
(1991), 277-282, Pola et al. disclosed that good results were
obtained in the treatments of arterial/venous cutaneous ulcers
with propionyl L-carnitine administered intravenously or orally.
This success was attributed to the rheological, vasoactive and
metabolic activities of that compound. However, it was not
suggested that this compound was
