<ABSTRACT>
A floor wiper has a carrier plate (1), to which there are attached two bow-type frame parts 5, 6 for receiving a changeable cover which is equipped along its longitudinal edges with flexible plastic parts which stiffen the longitudinal edges. One frame part 6 is mounted in the carrier plate 1 so as to be pivotable about a transverse axis A, and it is held in its extended position by a locking device 11. To pivot the frame part 6, a foot lever 12 is mounted on the carrier plate 1, which foot lever is pivotable about an axis 15 and is supported on the frame part 6 at a point 13 lying at a distance from the axis 15 and from the locking device 11. When the lever 12 is pushed down, the frame part 6 pivots downwards, overcoming the locking device 11.

Floor wiper having two bow-shaped frame parts (5, 
6) mounted on a bearing plate (1) to receive an exchangeable 

cover, one frame part (6) being mounted on the 
bearing plate (1) so as to be pivotable downwards about 

a transverse axis (A) and being able to be retained in 
its extended position, characterized in that a lever (12) 

is mounted on the bearing plate (1) above the frame part 
(6) so as to be pivotable against the frame part (6) 

about an axis (B) offset into the edge region of the 
bearing plate (1) parallel to the transverse axis (A), 

and when doing so acting upon points (13) at a distance 
from the axis (B), and in that the frame part (6) is held 

on the bearing plate (1), locked in the operating position 
by means of a retention (11). 
Floor wiper according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the retention of the pivotable frame part (6) is 

formed by lugs (11) on the bearing plate, which lugs 
interact with the limbs of the frame part (6) and are 

overcome by spreading the limbs when pivoted by the lever 
(12). 
Floor wiper according to Claims 1 and 2, characterized 
in that the free ends (6a) of the limbs at least 

of the pivotable frame part (6) are bent over through 
90Â°C and engage in blind holes (10) in the bearing plate 

(1). 
Floor wiper according to Claim 3, characterized 
in that the two frame parts (5, 6) are of identical 

design, and that the limbs of the non-pivotable frame 
part (5) are guided in guide grooves (7) which are open  

 
towards the outside and the limbs of the pivotable frame 

part (6) are guided in grooves (8), which are open 
towards the outside and bottom, on side surfaces of the 

bearing plate (1). 
Floor wiper according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the retention is formed by lugs 

(11) which are arranged between the transverse axis (A) 
and the points (13). 
Floor wiper according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the pivoting mounting of the l
ever 
(12) is composed of receivers (14), which are open 

towards the bottom, in the bearing plate (1) and mounting 
pins (15) which are pushed into the said bearing plate 

from the bottom and are formed on the lever (12). 
Floor wiper according to one or more of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the lever (12) is 

of bow-shaped design and is mounted on the bearing plate 
(1) so as to be pivotable by its ends. 
Floor wiper according to Claim 7, characterized 
in that the bearing plate (1) has recesses (16) to 

receive the ends of the bow-shaped lever (12), which 
recesses are open towards the bottom and whose upper 

walls (17) extend obliquely upwards and form stops for 
the lever (12) in the non-actuated state. 
Floor wiper according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the bearing plate (1) and 

the lever (12) are made of plastic and the frame parts 
(5, 6) of metal, and in that the lever (12) and the frame 

parts (5, 6) are connected to the bearing plate (1) by 
simple snap-on connections.
