<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus and method for storing holographic 
synthesized information for reflection integral Bragg 

holograms, free of the limitations of dispersing elements 
(such as unilateral diffusing screens, conventional 

lenticular screens and Fresnel lenses), multiple 
reference beams, mirrorized indexing or other similar 

materials or techniques. These holograms accurately 
satisfy Bragg's condition, provide an expanded (and 

essentially normal) vertical viewing range and can be 
displayed both flat (in which case the image is behind 

the film plane) or concave towards the viewer (in which 
case the image is in front of the film plane). Flat and 

curved holograms can be combined together. The final 
holographic images are produced directly from motion 

picture film, without intermediate transfer prints as 
required by the prior art. All are front illuminated. 

By curving the developed hologram for viewing a high 
definition projection image is obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
Over the past two decades many methods of 
synthesizing integral holograms have been investigated. 
These include transmission, image plane, projection and 
reflection integrals. Holograms of the integral type 
were first discussed in literature by Robert Pole of IBM 
in 1967. A number of improvements were advanced over the 
next several years. The most notable of these were 
developed by the Multiplex Company in 1969-1973; a group 
of individuals including Britton Zabka. Reflection holograms are formed when the reference 
and object beams are on opposite sides of the holographic 
medium during the hologram forming process. Transmission 
holograms are formed when the reference and object beams 
are on the same side of the recording medium; the object 
beam on axis, the reference beam off axis. The 
reflection hologram has been variously referred to as a 
reflection integral, a composite reflection hologram, a 
holographic reflection stereogram, Bragg's angle 
hologram, a volume hologram, or an amplitude hologram. As those trained in the art will appreciate, an 
integral hologram is made by running film images through 
an optical printer. In such a process, each frame of the 
film is projected through condensing optical elements 
which condenses the associated image down to a narrow 
vertical beam with a length corresponding to one of the 
sides of the finished hologram. This was initially done  
 
with a single double convex oil lens at Multiplex. This 
narrow beam is focused near the plane of holographic 
recording medium. The reference beam is brought in from 
the same side and an individual condensed slit or strip 
hologram is formed. Each succeeding frame of film used 
to form the hologram is made into a slit hologram, and 
sequentially laid down on the recording medium by 
slightly moving the recording medium between each 
exposure. When the resultant hologram composite is 
processed and then back illuminated with white light it 
reveals each individual strip hologram conveying an image 
which is two dimensional. However, each eye sees a 
slightly different slit and the viewer perceives a three 
dimensional image. A conventional reflection hologram acts as a 
resonant reflective filter, both angle and wavelength 
specific, absorbing light while acting as wavelength 
filter, unlike transmission integrals that are capable of 
constructively diffracting light through the same areas 
with many wavelengths and that ordinarily do not filter 
light. The Bragg or reflection hologram occurs because the
