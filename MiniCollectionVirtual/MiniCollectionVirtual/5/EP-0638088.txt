<ABSTRACT>
A hybrid human/porcine coagulation factor VIII is produced by isolation and recombination of human and porcine factor VIII subunits, or by genetic engineering of the human and porcine factor VIII genes. Subunits of factor VIII that have been purified from human or porcine plasma are isolated, and hybrid human/porcine factor VIII is produced by mixing either porcine heavy chain subunits with human light chain subunits or by mixing human heavy chain subunits with porcine light chain subunits, thereby producing human light chain/porcine heavy chain and human heavy chain/porcine light chain hybrid molecules. These hybrid molecules are isolated by ion exchange chromatography. Alternatively, recombinant DNA methods are used to swap elements of porcine factor VIII for the corresponding elements of human factor VIII to produce hybrid human/porcine factor VIII.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a hybrid
human/porcine factor VIII and methods of preparation
and use thereof.Blood clotting begins when platelets adhere to
the cut wall of an injured blood vessel at a lesion
site. Subsequently, in a cascade of enzymatically
regulated reactions, soluble fibrinogen molecules are
converted by the enzyme thrombin to insoluble strands
of fibrin that hold the platelets together in a
thrombus. At each step in the cascade, a protein
precursor is converted to a protease that cleaves the
next protein precursor in the series. Cofactors are
required at most of the steps. In its active form,
the protein factor VIII is a cofactor that is required
for the activation of factor X by the protease,
activated factor IX.Factor VIII or antihemophilic factor was noticed
in plasma and named in the 1930s. In the 1940s, a
deficiency in factor VIII was associated with the
clotting disorder hemophilia A. Factor VIII was found
to be X-linked and was hypothesized to be a protein.
Work involving bovine, human, and porcine plasma
identified factor VIII as a protein in the 1980s,
though its definitive cellular source remains
uncertain.Precisely how factor VIII functions in blood
coagulation is unknown. It is known that factor VIII
is activated to factor VIIIa proteolytically by
thrombin or factor Xa. In combination with calcium
and phospholipid, factor VIIIa makes factor IXa a more 
efficient activator of factor X by an unknown
mechanism.People deficient in factor VIII or having
antibodies against factor VIII who are not treated
with factor VIII suffer uncontrolled internal bleeding
that may cause a range of serious symptoms, from
inflammatory reactions in joints to early death.
Severe hemophiliacs, who number about 10,000 in the
United States, can be treated with infusion of factor
VIII, which will restore the blood's normal clotting
ability if administered with sufficient frequency and
concentration. The classic definition of factor VIII,
in fact, is that substance present in normal blood
plasma that corrects the clotting defect in plasma
derived from individuals with hemophilia A.Several preparations of human plasma-derived
factor VIII of varying degrees of purity are available
commercially for the treatment of hemophilia A. These
include a partially-purified factor VIII derived from
the pooled blood of many donors that is heat- and
detergent-treated for viruses but contains a
significant level of antigenic proteins; a monoclonal
antibody-purified factor VIII that has lower levels of
antigenic
