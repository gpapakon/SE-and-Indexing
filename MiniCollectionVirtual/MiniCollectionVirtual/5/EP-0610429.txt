<ABSTRACT>
A dual purpose sealable food container/building block element comprising an upper portion and a bottom portion, the upper portion being open, the upper portion and the bottom portion are provided with connecting members (5, 6), such that a plurality of the container/elements are connectable to one another by engaging the connecting members and sliding toward each other along the connecting members, for use of the container/elements as a toy after completing original use as a food container. To enable such large constructions to be firm and steady, the connecting members (5, 6) are of the slide type, engageable by insertion of rails (5) at the open ends of sockets (6) and sliding longitudinally into each other, perpendicular to the forces acting on assembled building blocks.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a dual-purpose
sealable container/building block element, particularly
useful as a food container. More particularly, the
invention is directed to a food container which may also
be used as a building block assembly toy after completing
its primary use as a container. Specifically, such
containers are mostly used for dairy products such as ice
cream, yogurt or the like.Various containers arranged for connection one to
another are known in the prior art of storage systems,
for example as shown in US-A-3,999,818 to Schankler.
The patent discloses an interlocking system of identical
modules for storage of microfilm cartridges or boxes,
particularly in a carousel arrangement. There is no
provision for sealing the front end of the modules.US-A-4,592,601 to Hlinsky et al. discloses an
expandable modular storage system for holding slides and
cassettes, using screws for interlocking adjacent
elements. Modular storage units for useful as furniture
items are disclosed in US-A-4,717,214 to Moore et
al. The modular units are each formed from identical
hingedly connected rectangular panels.An interlocking modular display rack system is
disclosed in US-A-4,480,745 to Loge et al.,
featuring a set of open, non-sealable holders for
supporting article caddies. US-A-4,423,913 to Lee discloses a display and
storage assembly using interlocking stackable open bins,
designed to be interlocked in a juxtaposed side-by-side
relationship.Other examples of stackable and interlocking
containers or boxes are disclosed in US-A-3,514,170
to Shewchuk and US-A-3,506,321 to Hampel. Neither of these
designs is sealable.US-A-3,131,829 to Masser discloses an article-carrying
container, which is not sealable.In the area of food packaging containers, it is
known to use open top cup-like containers made out of
plastic which are manufactured by the injection or vacuum
molding process, and sealed by bonded or folded aluminum
foil or by elastic-type plastic covers. These containers
are especially useful for such applications as dairy
products which usually have short shelf lives. Most
containers used today are disposable, having no other use
once the original contents are emptied, thus causing a
litter problem.Building block assembly toys are well known and used
by children throughout the world, and are available in
various shapes and sizes. Many kinds of connecting means
are used, most of them of the push-pull variety, with
material elasticity and friction as the joining method,
exhibiting only modest holding

A dual-purpose sealable food container/building
block element comprising a bottom portion and an upper

portion forming the side surface of the container and
extending along a longitudinal axis perpendicular to said

bottom portion,

said upper portion being open and having a lip (18)
protruding outwardly therefrom for sealing purposes when

said container element is used as a food container,

characterized in that each of said upper portion in
its side surface part and said bottom portion has mounted

thereon at least one type of engageable connecting means
comprising sets (1,2,9,10) of rails (5,30,34,38,44) and sockets (6,31,35,37,43),
said upper portion rails (5,30,38) and sockets (6,31,37) extending
parallel to said longitudinal axis and said bottom portion

rails (5,34,44) and sockets (6,35,43) extending perpendicular to said
longitudinal axis, such that a plurality of said container/block

elements are directly connectable to one another in
proximate fashion without interstitial gaps therebetween by

engaging said sets (1,2,9,10) of rails (5,30,34,38,44) and sockets (6,31,35,37,43),
and sliding toward each other to a stop engagement position

defined by said lip (18), for use of said container/block
elements as a toy after completing original use as a food

container.
The container/element of claim 1, characterized in

that part of said lip (18) is removable by tearing off
before said container/element is adapted as a building

block when used as a toy.
The container/element of claim 1, characterized in
that said upper portion is provided with two rails (30) and

two sockets (31) in equal division on the perimeter of said
container and said bottom portion is provided with one rail

The container/element of claim 3, characterized in
that said two rails (30) on said upper portion are directly

opposite each other.
The container/element of claim 3, characterized in
