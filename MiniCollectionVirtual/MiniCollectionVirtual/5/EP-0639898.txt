<ABSTRACT>
In a mobile communication system for calling mobile unit by repeatedly transmitting the same call signal by 
n call frames, each call frame is constituted by n sub-frames each containing a call signal and having a predetermined 

length, a sub-frame containing a new call signal is disposed at one of the ends of the call frame, and the sub-frames 
are shifted in their sequence each time after the first call. According to this construction, the number of times 

of transmission can be known on the receiver side without transmitting additional information, and time diversity 
reception can be made on the reception side.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is utilized in mobile radio communications, and relates in
particular to technology for selectively calling a mobile unit. More precisely, it
relates to technology whereby a mobile unit is called by multiple transmission of a paging signal.Technology for selectively calling a mobile unit is general to mobile
communications. However, for simplicity, the example explained below is a radio
paging system which employs receive-only mobile units.Figure 1 shows a conventional frame format for the paging signal frames in a
radio paging system (see, for example, "Mobile Radio Communications in the ISDN
Age", Vol.1, p.26, published by OHM-Sha, Ltd., 25th July 1992). In this figure, (a)
shows the sending period of the paging signal frame stream, (b) shows the frame
format of a paging signal frame, and (c) shows the frame format of a paging signal.
As shown in Figure 1(a), the paging signal frame stream sent from a base station
comprises signals with period T, where each such signal comprises j paging signal
frames with signal length p joined together. As shown in Figure 1(b), a paging signal
frame comprises a synchronization signal and a plurality of paging signals which
belong to this paging signal frame and which have different lengths. As shown in
Figure 1(c), a paging signal comprises error correcting codes obtained by the addition
of check bits to both address information and message information.Figure 2 shows conventional frame format for a paging signal frame.
In this figure, (a) shows the frame format of the paging signal frame at time t0, while
(b) shows the frame format of the paging signal frame at time (t0+T). Radio paging
systems employ multiple sending to achieve high quality paging signal transmission.
This is a method wherein the same paging signal is sent many times (n times) at the
transmitting side, and call processing (usually involving an alert and a message
display) is carried out at the receiving side on the basis of one of these n paging
signals having been correctly decoded. When such a method is employed, in order
for the receiving side to receive the same paging signal a plural number of times, it
has to recognize the number of times the paging signal has been sent. For this
purpose, counter bits indicating the number of times the paging signal has been sent
(or the remaining number of times that it will be sent) have hitherto been provided in
each paging signal that is sent. The receiving side has therefore recognized the 
number of times that a paging signal has been
