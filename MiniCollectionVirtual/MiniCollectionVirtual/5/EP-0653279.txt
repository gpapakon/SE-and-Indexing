<ABSTRACT>
A method for manufacturing integral elastic supports formed 
by an upper covering (2), by an intermediate filler (3) and 

by a semirigid shell (4) entails the use of a mold with a 
hollow lower part, a flat upper part, and at least one 

intermediate plate. The method includes the following steps: 
opening of the mold; deposition on the lower part of a 

covering sheet with an excess border; securing of the excess 
border by means of the locking plate; deformation of the 

covering sheet in vacuum; pouring of a first layer of a gel 
compound (7) in the fluid state; coupling of a semirigid shell (4) 

to the upper part of the mold; pouring of a second layer of 
an expandable resin (6) in the fluid state; closing of the mold; 

opening of the mold and removal of the finished support. The 
expandable resin is poured onto the gel compound after a 

period of time that is sufficient to allow the compound to 
assume a consistency and shape of its own but is shorter 

than the full polymerization time so as to allow it to react 
at least partially with the resin.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for manufacturing
integral elastic supports and to an integral support
obtained by means of this method.Typical examples of elastic supports manufactured according
to the present invention are the backs and seats for
contoured chairs or wheelchairs, for the physically
challenged and older people, supports for parts of the
bodies of patients forced to long periods of immobility,
seats for industrial vehicles, and saddles for bicycles and
motorcycles.It is known that the region of contact between the surface
of the support and the part of the human body that must be
supported is normally concentrated proximate to the ischial
bones of the pelvis. Accordingly, specific pressure is
relatively high in these regions and can prevent oxygenation
of tissues and correct blood circulation, causing so-called
bedsores and other similar disorders. In other cases, as in
bicycle saddles used by healthy individuals and athletes,
the high specific pressure can create extremely troublesome
irritations or affections of the tissues and can, in some
cases, temporarily or permanently damage delicate organs,
such as the genitalia and the prostate. On this subject,
reference is made to the article published by "Bicycling"
magazine of July 1993, pages 57-60. These effects are
sometimes increased by the presence of discontinuities or
folds on the covering of the support, caused by lack of
tension or of adhesion of the covering to the underlying 
filler.In order to reduce the specific pressure in the above
mentioned delicate regions of the body, supports have been
produced that are formed by an outer covering that encloses
a padding which includes one or more layers or sacs of
materials that are more resilient than the rest of the
support. The materials used for this purpose are gaseous,
such as compressed gas or air, particularly flexible
elastomeric materials, open-cell polyurethane foams, some
high-viscosity oily or thixotropic liquids, or combinations
of these materials. Examples of these supports are given by
French patent No. 2,306,866, by German patent No. 75,799, by
European patent No. 0 013 527 and by US patents No. 718,850,
3,161,436, 4,012,072, 3,807,793, 4,588,229, and 4,808,469.Supporting structures with elastomeric materials in gel form
that behave like liquids but have partial resilience or
elastic memory have recently been perfected; reference is
made to US patents 3,548,420 and 3,663,973 on this subject.These known supporting structures generally include a layer
of gel
