<ABSTRACT>
A topical application composition with light-screening properties in a special application form is disclosed. The problem with known light-screening agents containing native melanine as active substance is an insufficient melanin transport to its site of activity. The invention solves this problem with a topical application composition characterized by a content of melanin dissolved or dispersed in one or several fluorocarbons available as asymmetrical lamellar phospholipid aggregates in an aqueous system, together with a phospholipid. The particle size of the aggregates lies in the 200 to 3000 nm range.

<CLAIMS>
Preparation for topical use, characterised in 
that it contains melanin, dissolved or dispersed in one 

or more fluorocarbons, which are present as asymmetric 
lamellar phospholipid aggregates in an aqueous system 

together with a phospholipid, with a particle size of the 
aggregates in the range from 200 to 3000 nm. 
Preparation according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that the amount of fluorocarbons is in the range from 

1 to 100 % w/v. 
Preparation according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the fluorocarbons are selected from 

the group which consists of aliphatic straight-chain and 
branched fluoroalkanes, mono- or bicyclic, optionally 

fluoroalkyl-substituted, fluorocycloalkanes, perfluorinated 
aliphatic or bicyclic amines, bis-(perfluoroalkyl)ethenes, 

perfluoropolyethers and mixtures 
thereof. 
Preparation according to Claim 3, characterised 
in that the fluorocarbons are selected from the group 

which consists of perfluorodecalin, F-butyltetrahydrofuran, 
perfluorotributylamine, perfluorooctyl bromide, 

bis-fluoro(butyl)ethene and C₆-C₉-perfluoroalkanes. 
Preparation according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the amount of fluorocarbons is in 

the range from 20 to 100 % weight/volume, preferably in 
the range from 40 to 100 %, in particular in the range 

from 70 to 100 %. 
Preparation according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised by one or more fluorocarbons having a 

critical solubility temperature below 50°C, preferably 
below 30°C. 
Preparation according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the phospholipids are selected from  

 
the group consisting of natural phospholipids such as 

soya lecithin and egg lecithin, synthetic phospholipids 
and hydrogenated lecithins and/or partially hydrogenated 

phospholipids. 
Preparation according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that phosphatidylcholine is present in 

an amount from 10 to 99 % by weight, preferably 30 to 
99 %, in particular 70 to 90 %. 
Preparation according to one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that, in addition to phosphatidylcholine, 

lysolecithins are present in the concentration 
range from 1 to 10 % by weight. 
Preparation according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that, in addition to melanin and fluorocarbon, a 

solubiliser, selected from the group consisting of the 
native oils such as olive oil, soya bean oil, sunflower 

oil, the triglycerides or the aliphatic alkanes such as 
pentane, heptane, nonane or decane, and mixtures within 

or between the groups, is present. 
Process for the production of preparations for 
topical use, characterised in that melanin
 is dissolved 
or dispersed in one or more fluorocarbons and this 

dispersion is converted by homogenisation with a 
phospholipid in an aqueous system into asymmetric 

lamellar phospholipid aggregates containing the fluorocarbons 
and melanin, having particle sizes between 200 

and 3000 nm. 
Process according to Claim 11, characterised in 
that a solubiliser, selected from the group consisting of 

the native oils such as olive oil, soya bean oil, sunflower 
oil, the triglycerides or the aliphatic alkanes 

such as pentane, heptane, nonane or decane, and mixtures 
within or between the groups, is added to melanin and the 

fluorocarbons. 
Use of asymmetric lamellar phospholipid aggregates 
for the production of agents for introducing 

melanin into the skin region above the epidermis, the  
 

asymmetric lamellar phospholipid aggregates consisting of 
a phospholipid and one or more fluorocarbons containing 

melanin dissolved or dispersed therein, the particle size 
of the aggregates being in the range from 200 to 3000 nm. 
Use according to Claim 13, characterised by a 
phosphatidylcholine content of the phospholipids from 

10 to 99 % by weight, preferably 30 to 99 %, in 
particular 70 to 90 %.
