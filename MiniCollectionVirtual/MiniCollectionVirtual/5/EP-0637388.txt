<DESCRIPTION>
 DescriptionDurable Metallized Polymer MirrorThe United States Government has rights in this invention under Contract No. DE-AC02-83CH 10093 between the United States Department of Energy and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, a Division of the Midwest Research Institute.Technical FieldThe present invention pertains to metallized polymer mirror constructions having improved durability, and represents an improvement over conventional polymer mirror constructions by virtue of having an oxide layer interposed between an outer layer of polymeric material and the reflective layer of silver. The oxide acts as an adhesive layer and impedes the initiation of delamination as well as the propagation of delamination (tunneling), if initiation of delamination occurs. The interposed oxide layer further provides protection to the silver layer and slows corrosion of the silver layer. In a preferred construction, a copper layer is disposed between the layer of silver and the adhesive layer, and in this preferred construction, the copper also helps slow corrosion of the silver.Background ArtCurrent polymer mirror designs use a vacuum metallized polymer that is attached by an adhesive layer to a substrate; however, in harsh, outdoor environments, these current polymer mirror designs tend to degrade by delamination and by silver corrosion. In particular, it has been noted in these prior art designs with conventional constructions that the adhesion hetween the polymer (i.e., polymethylmethacrylate) and silver is weak and deteriorates in the presence of moisture. Further, the polymer can delaminate from the silver and degrade specular reflectance. 

 Therefore, a need exist in the polymer mirror design art to identify metallized polymer constructions that can be used in commercial mirror systems in place of materials currently being used, to provide sufficient durability. In identifying metallized polymer constructions capable of alleviating or lessening insufficient durability, there is a need to address the primary problem that current metallized polymer mirrors do not maintain specular reflectance in a harsh, outdoor environment, and that current materials degrade by delamination and by silver corrosion - and that the successful resolution to these problems would slow both types of degradation.In essence, the identification of metallized polymer constructions capable of resolving the foregoing problems would reside in selecting the proper choice and placement of materials, so that the factors that contribute to
