<ABSTRACT>
Aggregate directed into a rotary kiln (12) is preheated 
continuously and in a highly effective manner by directing 

the aggregate downwardly along a passageway (35) formed 
by a pair of gas permeable retaining walls (36) which extend 

generally vertically in opposing spaced relation to one 
another. The retaining walls (36) are of a zigzag configuraÂ­

tion so arranged as to direct the thin layer of aggregate 
along a sinuous path of travel in the course of its downward 

movement along the passageway (35) as heated gas from 
the kiln (12) is directed through the retaining walls (36) 

guiding the aggregate.
