<ABSTRACT>
A substrate electrode (1) having a plurality of substrate 
holders (2) capable of causing a substrate to tilt by 

an arbitrary angle ϑ relative to the horizontal plane is 
provided. A plurality of auxiliary electrodes (3) are arranged 

substantially vertically below the substrate electrode 
and between the substrate electrode (1) and a target 

(4). The substrate electrode (1) and the auxiliary electrodes 
(3) are electrically insulated from the target (4). 

Bias voltage applied to the substrate electrode (1) and the 
auxiliary electrodes (3) causes the plasma boundary (5) between 

the cathode dark space and the negative glow to form a 
cathodic plasma space having a parabolic section, thus 

forming a crystal-oriented thin film on the substrate surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a crystal-oriented
thin film manufacturing method which permits control of
crystal orientation of a thin film during forming. More
particularly, the present invention relates to a novel
crystal-oriented thin film manufacturing method which permits
very efficient manufacture of a thin film having a
preferred orientation suitable for such uses as various
functional thin films and buffer thin films for crystal
growth, by using a sputtering apparatus, and causing a
charged particle group to obliquely enter the growing film
surface while controlling the particle group.Along with the recent progress of extra-precision
and extra-fine technologies, functional thin film technologies
have achieved a very remarkable progress. This
progress is supported by control technology of thin film
crystal structure as typically represented by epitaxy, i.e.,
by control technology of crystal orientation.There are however problems not as yet solved by these
technical innovations, and one of these problems is that it
is difficult to cause crystal growth while controlling
crystal orientation on a polycrystalline substance or an
amorphous substance.When causing a thin film to grow on a substrate
comprising a polycrystalline substance such as a metal or a
ceramic or an amorphous substance such as glass, the possibility
of causing such growth while controlling the crystal orientation, 
if any, would make it possible to provide a thin film
having more sophisticated physical and chemical properties
or functions in a variety of areas such as superconductivity,
magnetic thin film and optical thin film.When manufacturing an orientation film on a substrate
comprising a polycrystalline substance or an amorphous
substance, orientation in only a uniaxial orientation
as in a c-axis orientation crystal accounts for the most
part. In order to obtain a thin film of triaxial orientation
in the form of a single crystal, on the other hand, it
has conventionally been the only practice to form the film
by using a single-crystal substrate by the epitaxial technique,
or by the grapho-epitaxy technique of causing growth
of a single-crystal film by applying a fine step processing
to the substrate surface by means of the patterning technique.Under these circumstances as described above, L.S.
Yu et al. of IBM released their first report suggesting the
possibility of controlling not only the c-axis but also
orientation within the a-b plane by forming a Nb thin film
on a glass substrate by the application of the ion-assist
fil
