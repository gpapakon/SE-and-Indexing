<ABSTRACT>
A saw-tooth waveform signal generating circuit 3 generates 
a saw-tooth waveform signal 
d
 in response to a timing signal 
b
 
derived from a reference clock 
a
. A voltage comparator 4 slices 
the saw-tooth waveform signal with a reference voltage to shape 

the waveform thereof, thereby producing a synthesizer output 
e
 
having a rectangular waveform. A counter 5 adds or subtracts a 

predetermined value every time a reference clock arrives. The 
count of the counter 5 is converted to an analog value by a DAC 

6 and then is applied to, for example, the saw-tooth waveform 
signal generating circuit as a bias. As a result, the voltage 

for causing the saw-tooth waveform signal to start rising or 
falling is manipulated to allow the voltage comparator to slice 

the saw-tooth waveform signal at any desired timing. Hence, a 
synthesizer output can be produced in any desired phase.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a frequency synthesizer
and to a method of synthesizing a frequency. It relates more
particularly to a direct frequency synthesizer or Direct
Digital Synthesizer (DDS) not using a Phase Locked Loop (PLL).In a conventional frequency synthesizer extensively used in
various technological fields, digital values corresponding to a
sinusoidal waveform of desired frequency are generated by a
counter and a ROM or waveform data table. After that, a quasi-sinusoidal
waveform is produced by a digital-to-analog converter.
Such a frequency synthesizer is disclosed in, for example, United
States Patent Number 3,735,269.The conventional frequency synthesizer described above is
constructed to produce a desired frequency by generating a quasi-sinusoidal
stepped waveform. Theoretically, therefore, the
synthesizer suffers from phase errors and cannot remove them even
if all the circuit elements thereof have ideal values.Moreover, the quasi-sinusoidal wave cannot be produced
unless four or more regeneration points exist in one period. The
frequency of the reference clock, therefore, has to be at least
four times as high as the output frequency of the synthesizer. 
This increases the current consumption and obstructs precision
and miniaturization.In addition, a higher-order low pass filter (LPF) and,
therefore, a coil part are required, making circuit integration
difficult.European Patent Application 0 230 826 Al (Thomson-CSF)
discloses a high-frequency digital synthesizer with aperiodic
correction, in which feedback from the synthesizer output is
used to delay overflow timing pulses from an accumulator to a
saw-tooth generator in order to improve synchronization between
the accumulator output and ramping of the saw-tooth generator.It is therefore an object of at least the preferred
embodiments of the present invention to provide a frequency
synthesizer, or DDS, capable of reducing, theoretically, phase
errors approximately to zero.Another object of the preferred embodiments of the present
invention is to provide a frequency synthesizer capable of
consuming a minimum of power, and having a simple circuit
arrangement feasible for circuit integration.In one aspect, the invention is a frequency synthesizer
comprising: timing signal means for generating a timing signal
on the basis of a clock consisting of a train of clock pulses;
saw-tooth waveform generating means responsive to said timing
signal for generating a saw-tooth waveform signal whose time
and voltage amplitude are proportional;
