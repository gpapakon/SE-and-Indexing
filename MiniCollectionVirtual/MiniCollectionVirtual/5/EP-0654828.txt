matrix liquid crystal display (AMLCD) including a 

centrally located round source electrode substantially 
completely surrounded by a substantially annular or 

circular shaped drain electrode. The geometric design of 
the TFT of this invention provides for a thin film 

transistor having a reduced parasitic capacitance and 
decreased photosensitivity. The TFTs of this invention 

are located at the intersections of gate and drain lines 
of an active matrix LCD array thereby increasing the size 

of the pixel display openings of the matrix array.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a TFT (thin film
transistor) array in an active matrix liquid crystal
display (AMLCD) having a plurality of TFTs arranged in
the form of a matrix, each TFT including a gate
electrode, a semiconductor film, a drain electrode, a
source electrode, and a pixel electrode stacked on a
transparent insulation substrate. In particular, the invention regards a pixel for a liquid crystal display, as defined in the preamble of claim 1.Active matrix liquid crystal display devices are
composed of a matrix of liquid crystal pixels arranged
horizontally in rows and vertically in columns. The
individual liquid crystal picture elements or pixels
include first and second opposing polarizers, a liquid
crystal material disposed between the polarizers, and
transparent electrodes mounted on opposite sides of the
liquid crystal material. Individual pixels of active
matrix liquid crystal displays are more fully described
in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,632,514; 5,150,235; and 5,161,041,
the disclosures of which are incprporated herein by
reference.Electronic matrix arrays find considerable
application in active matrix liquid crystal displays.
Such active matrix displays generally include X and Y 
address lines which are vertically and horizontally
spaced apart and cross at an angle to one another thereby
forming a plurality of crossover points. Associated with
each crossover point is an element to be selectively
addressed. These elements can be, for example, liquid
crystal display pixels or the memory cells of an
electronically addressable memory array.Some form of isolation device (e.g. a thin film
transistor) is generally associated with each array
element or pixel. The isolation elements permit the
individual elements or pixels to be selectively addressed
by the application of suitable read potentials between
respective pairs of the X and Y address lines.Amorphous semiconductor thin film field effect
transistors or TFTs have found wide usage for the
isolation devices in such arrays. Thin film transistors
formed from deposited semiconductors such as amorphous
silicon alloys are ideally suited for such applications
because they exhibit a very high dark resistivity and,
therefore, have very low OFF state currents. The reverse
leakage currents are so low that very high ON-to-OFF
current ratios are made possible for effectively
isolating the non-addressed array pixels from the pixels
being addressed.Structurally, thin film transistors (TFTs) generally
include substantially co-planar source and drain
electrodes, a
