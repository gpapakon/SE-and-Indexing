<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pneumatic tyre 
capable of preventing heel and toe wear on the block 
surface, and maintaining wet grip performance and 
wear appearance for a long period. In high speed running on a wet road surface, 
hitherto, in order to improve the water discharging 
performance and suppress the phenomenon of 
hydroplaning, the tread surface was provided with a 
plurality of main grooves extending in the 
circumferential direction, and multiple lateral 
grooves linking with the longitudinal grooves. Such lateral grooves have been designed to 
effectively suppress the hydroplaning and maintain 
appearance even at the terminal stage of the tread 
wear by for example the method shown in Fig. 11, 
which has 
(1) Deepened lateral grooves groove depth DB. (2) Widened lateral grooves WO'. (3) Having the sectional shape of the lateral 
grooves in a U form.  However, when the lateral grooves are thus 
constituted, when running on a dry road, uneven wear 
along the groove edge of the lateral grooves, or so-called 
heel and toe wear occurs, and the durability 
is lowered. It is hence the object of the invention to 
present a pneumatic tyre capable of preventing heel 
and toe wear, maintaining the wet grip performance 
and wear appearance for a long period, and enhancing 
the running performance also on a snow-clad road. The present inventor has reached the invention by 
discovering that: 
(1) The sectional shape of the lateral grooves 
should not be uniform in groove width, but a middle 
pattern of the groove in the depth direction should 
be provided with a waist portion constricted in 
width so as to make the upper and lower portions 
wider than this constricted waist portion. (2) By defining the groove width ratio of the 
lower portion and constricted waist portion, the wet 
grip performance and tyre appearance can be 
maintained even in the terminal stage of wear. (3) By defining further the ratio of the 
length of the constricted waist portion and the  
 
depth of the lateral groove, the wet grip 
performance is enhanced. According to the present invention, a 
pneumatic tyre comprises a tread having a plurality 
of main grooves extending continually in the 
circumferential direction and a plurality of 
lateral grooves crossing between the adjoining main 
grooves and having a groove depth DB of 0.6 to 0.95 
times the mean DM of groove depths DA1, DA2 of the 
adjoining main grooves, characterised in that said 
plurality of lateral grooves are composed of, in a 
section orthogonal to the
