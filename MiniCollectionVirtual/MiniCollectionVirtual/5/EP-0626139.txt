<ABSTRACT>
Selected high molecular weight gallotannins are 
incorporated into FD
&
C dye-containing foodstuffs to 
prevent staining of polymeric substrates such as wool or 

nylon rugs and clothing. Gallotannins from sumac leaves 
and Chinese nut galls are effective at levels of 50 ppm 

or below. This invention is useful in foodstuffs which 
are not subject to oxidation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the art of inhibiting the 
staining action of certain dyes, such as FD&C food dyes, 
by means of high molecular weight gallotannins. More 
particularly, this invention relates to artificially-colored 
compositions, particularly foodstuffs, in which 
the colorant is a food-approved dye having an affinity 
for polyamides, wherein the artificially-colored 
composition also contains high molecular weight 
gallotannins in an amount effective to inhibit staining 
of polymers such as nylcn, silk, wool, etc. Still 
another aspect of this invention relates to a method for 
formulating foodstuffs. The consumer acceptance of several types of 
foodstuffs, such as beverages (e.g., fruit-flavored soft 
drinks), baked goods, candies, cake mixes, gelatins, 
puddings, and other highly processed foods) can be 
adversely affected by dye migration or staining. For  
 
example, if a processed foodstuff containing a dye 
approved for human consumption (in the U.S., these are 
generally the FD&C dyes) is packaged with a material 
containing a polyamide, and the dye migrates to and 
stains the polyamide, the resulting internal appearance 
of the food package can be too aesthetically displeasing 
to be sold, even though the packaged product is 
perfectly safe to eat. This problem is sometimes 
referred to as "color bleed". Consumer acceptance of artificially-colored food 
products can also be adversely affected by stubborn 
stains produced by inadvertent spills on materials 
commonly found in homes, e.g., melamine-formaldehyde 
sheets on counter tops, polyamide fibers (particularly 
in wool or nylon carpets, clothes, including silk 
clothes, drapes, and other woven and non-woven 
materials), etc. Soft drinks are especially likely to 
stain clothes, counter tops, drapes and carpets, even 
though these drinks may contain only parts per million 
of the food-approved dye. Various stain-blocking agents have been 
investigated in terms of their ability to block or 
inhibit the staining action of the ingestible, non-toxic 
dyestuffs used in processed foods. Some of these agents 
are referred to as "resist agents" and can contain 
sulfonated aromatic compounds. See, for example, U.S. 
Patent 5,096,726 (Keown et al.), issued March 17, 1992. 
Although these "resist agents" can be low in toxicity, 
they are typically synthetic compounds not having any 
close analogs in nature and, to date, have not been 
approved for food use. Accordingly, although some of 
these synthetic sulfonated aromatic compounds are used
