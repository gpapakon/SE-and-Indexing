<ABSTRACT>
A stator core 28 for an electromagnetic pump 10 includes a plurality of 
circumferentially adjoining groups 50 of flat laminations 52 disposed about a common 

centerline axis 54 and collectively defining a central bore 58 and a discontinuous outer 
perimeter 60, with adjacent groups 50 diverging radially outwardly to form V-shaped gaps 

62. An annular band 66 surrounds the groups 50 and is predeterminedly tensioned to 
clamp together the laminations 52, and has a predetermined flexibility in a radial direction 

to form substantially straight bridge sections 66a between the adjacent groups 50.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to electromagnetic pumps, and, more 
specifically, to electrical stators therein. In one type of nuclear reactor power plant, liquid metal, such as liquid sodium, is 
used for the coolant which is heated by the reactor core. The liquid metal is circulated 
within the reactor by a plurality of annular linear-flow electromagnetic induction pumps 
which propel the liquid metal using electromagnetic force. A typical electromagnetic pump includes an annular flow channel or duct surrounded 
by a column of alternately vertically stacked annular electrical stator coils and magnetic 
stator iron cores collectively forming a stator. Electrical current carried by the coils induces 
magnetic flux which is channeled through the cores in a predetermined direction for 
inductively propelling the liquid metal through the flow channel. An electromagnetic pump may have solely a single stator surrounding the outside 
of the flow channel for propelling the liquid metal therethrough. Or, an electromagnetic 
pump may have double stators including an outer stator surrounding the flow channel, and 
an inner stator disposed radially inwardly of the flow channel. Each stator is similarly 
configured with alternating layers of stator coils supported by stator cores. Since the 
double stator electromagnetic pump is effective for generating magnetic flux both radially 
inwardly and radially outwardly of the flow channel, it is typically more effective for 
propelling the liquid metal axially through the flow channel. In both types of pumps, the stator coils typically include a plurality of turns or 
windings of copper electrical conductors disposed coaxially about the longitudinal centerline 
axis of the pump. The alternating stacks of stator coils are supported on respective stator 
cores, with each stator core including a plurality of circumferentially adjoining iron 
laminations. The laminations are typically flat, sheet metal components which are relatively  
 
thin for reducing eddy current losses therein. Since the laminations are a constant 
thickness and extend radially outwardly from the pump centerline axis, they can tightly abut 
each other at their radially inner ends, but at their radially outer ends a larger circumference 
is provided than the laminations have the capability of filling. Accordingly, the laminations 
are typically configured in groups having a constant thickness in the circumferential 
direction, with generally V-shaped gaps being formed between adjacent ones of

A stator core (28) for an electromagnetic pump (10) for supporting an 
electrical coil (30) comprising: 


a plurality of circumferentially adjoining groups (50) of flat laminations 
(52) disposed about a common centerline axis (54) and collectively defining a 

central bore (58) at radially inner ends (52a) thereof and a discontinuous outer 
perimeter (60) at radially outer ends (52b) thereof, adjacent ones of said 

groups (50) diverging radially outwardly at an acute angle therebetween to 
form a V-shaped gap (62) therebetween; and 
means (66) surrounding said groups (50) along said outer ends (52b) 
and being predeterminedly tensioned to clamp together said laminations (52) 

in each of said groups (50), characterized by said means (66) being an annular 
band having a thickness of about 0.9 mm so as to be sufficiently flexible in a 

radial direction relative to said centerline axis (54) to form substantially straight 
bridge sections (66a) bridging said gaps (62) between said adjoining groups 

(50), said band comprising: 
first and second opposing ends (66b, 66c); and 
a fastener (70) joining together said first and second ends (66b, 66c) 
and being adjustable to draw together said first and second ends (66b, 67c) to 

generate a predetermined tension in said band (66). 
A core according to claim 1, wherein said fastener (70) comprises a 
turnbuckle including a left-handed first bolt (70b) extending co-linearly from 

said band first end (66b), a right-handed second bolt (70c) extending co-linearly 
from said band second end (66c), and a tubular sleeve (70a) having 

internal threads at opposite ends thereof threadingly receiving said respective 
first and second bolts (70b, 70c), said sleeve (70a) being rotatable for drawing  

 
together said first and second bolts (70b, 70c) to increase tension in said band 

(66). 
A core according to claim 1 or 2, further comprising a plurality of slide 
plates (72) disposed between respective ones of said groups (50) and said 

band (66) for allowing said band (66) to slide on said slide plates (72) 
circumferentially around said perimeter (60). 
A core according to claim 3, wherein each of said groups (50) 
includes a recess (74) extending circumferentially in said outer ends (52b) 

sized to receive therein one of said slide plates (72) and a portion of said band 
(66) to restrain axial movement thereof while allowing circumferential 

movement of said band (66). 
A core according to any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein said band (66) 
includes a plurality of said turnbuckles (70) equidistantly spaced around said 

perimeter (60). 
A core according to any one of claims 1 to 5, further comprising a ring 
(64) disposed coaxially in said bore (58) for aligning said groups (50) at said 

radially inner ends (52a) of said laminations, said ring (64) being in 
compression due to tension in said band (66).
