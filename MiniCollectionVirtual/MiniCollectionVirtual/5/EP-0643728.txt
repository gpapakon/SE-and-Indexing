 ICAM-RELATED PROTEINThis application is a continuation-in-part of co-pending U.S. Patent * Application Serial No. 08/009,266, filed January 22, 1993 and InternationalApplication No. PCT/US93/00787 filed January 26, 1993; which are in turn 5 continuations-in-part of U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 07/894,061 , filed June5, 1992; which is in turn a continuation-in-part of co-pending U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 07/889,724, filed May 26, 1992; which is in turn a continuation-in-part of co-pending U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 07/827,689, filed January 27, 1992.10 FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates generally to cellular adhesion molecules and more particularly to the cloning and expression of DNA encoding a heretofore unknown human polypeptide designated "ICAM-R" which possesses structural relatedness to the intercellular adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and -2.15 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONResearch spanning the last decade has significantly elucidated the molecular events attending cell-cell interactions in the body, especially those events involved in the movement and activation of cells in the immune system.See generally, Springer, Nature, 346: 425-434 (1990). Cell surface proteins, and20 especially the so-called Cellular Adhesion Molecules ("CAMs") have correspondingly been the subject of pharmaceutical research and development having as its goal intervention in the processes of leukocyte extravasation to sites of inflammation and leukocyte movement to distinct target tissues. The isolation and characterization of cellular adhesion molecules, the cloning and expression of> 25 DNA sequences encoding such molecules, and the development of therapeutic and•» diagnostic agents relevant to inflammatory processes, viral infection and cancer metastasis have also been the subject of numerous U.S. and foreign applications for Letters Patent. See Edwards, Current Opinion in Therapeutic Patents, 1(11): 

1617-1630 (1991) and particularly the published "patent literature references" cited therein.Of fundamental interest to the background of the present invention are the prior identification and characterization of certain mediators of cell adhesion events, the "leukointegrins," LFA-1, MAC-1 .and gp 150.95 (referred to in WHO nomenclature as CD18/CDlla, CD18/CDllb, and CD18/CDllc, respectively) which form a subfamily of heterodimeric "integrin" cell surface proteins present on B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes monocytes and granulocytes. See, e.g., Table 1 of Springer, supra, at page 429. Also of
