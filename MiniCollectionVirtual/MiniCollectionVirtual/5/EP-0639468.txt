<ABSTRACT>
A heat sensitive original sheet for stencil printing made 
of a laminate of a paper sheet and a biaxially oriented polyester film 

having a melting point of 150 to 240°, a thickness of 0.2 to 3 µm, an 
average refractive index of 1.570 to 1.578, a thermal shrinkage 

stress of 100 to 800 g/mm² after being treated at 80°C in a water bath 
for 10 

seconds, a thermal shrinkage factor of 5 to 50 % after being treated 
at 80°C in an oven for 10 minutes, a shrinkage factor of 15 % or less 

after 
being treated in toluene at 25°C for 10 minutes, and a center line 

average surface roughness of 0.02 to 0.3 µm, which original sheet is 
excellent in a perforation sensitivity, resistance to curling, and 

resolution and image density of a printed image.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polyester film for a 
highly heat sensitive original sheet for stencil printing. In particular, 
the present invention relates to a film for a highly heat sensitive 
original sheet for stencil printing, which comprises at least two 
polyester resins having specific properties, is excellent in a perforation 
sensitivity and resistance to curl because of its specific 
shrinking characteristics, and also excellent in resolution and image 
density of a printed image. Hitherto, as a heat sensitive original sheet for stencil 
printing, a laminate of a thermoplastic resin film such as a polyester 
film and a porous thin (tissue) paper sheet. The film to be used in 
this use is required to have the following properties: 
(1) The film has a good handling property and productivity 
in the preparation of the film itself and the original sheet. 
That is, in the preparation of the film, the film has good drawability 
and does not suffer from troubles such as breakage. Further, it 
should have good winding and slitting properties, so that it is not 
wrinkled or does not suffer from telescopic winding. In the preparation 
of the original sheet, it should not cause troubles in an unwinding 
step or during travelling of the film in the steps. (2) The film should have sufficient strength and modulus 
for enduring the lamination works with the porous tissue paper and  
 
printing works. The film should not curl due to the lamination condition 
or change of temperature and humidity during storage. When it 
curls to a large extent, the handing property and transportability of 
the original sheet in a stencil printing machine are deteriorated, so 
that troubles such as clogging of the original sheet will occur. (3) The film should have good thermal perforation sensitivity. 
That is, the film is molten with a small amount of heat, and 
has a shrinking property sufficient for forming suitable size holes to 
provide a clearly printed image. (4) In the multiple engravings, the thermal perforation 
sensitivity is not decreased. That is, a surfactant and a silicone oil 
in a releasing layer, or molten mass of the film do not adhere to and 
contaminate a thermal head. (5) Gradation of the thermal perforation is good. When 
the original sheet is used, if a part surrounding a specific part to be 
perforated is molten by the influence of perforation of the specific 
part, the degradation of the printed image is deteriorated unpreferably. 
Accordingly, the film should have a thermal perforating 
proper
