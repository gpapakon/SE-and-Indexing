<ABSTRACT>
A signalling light for a motor vehicle comprises a plurality of low-power light sources (10), a cover lens (40) arranged in front of the sources and an intermediate optical processing plate (30) arranged between the sources and the cover lens. According to the invention the intermediate plate comprises, on its face pointing towards the sources, ordered arrangements (31) for spreading the light flux and, on its face pointing towards the cover lens, arrangements (32) for concentrating light flux. The invention also provides for optical arrangements with two series of V-shaped grooves oriented transversely to each other so as to define four favoured deflection directions. Application to lights with light-emitting diodes.
