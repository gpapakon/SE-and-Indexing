<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a tube (1) made of plastic. In its wall (4) the tube (1) has a body (6) which can be pierced by a hypodermic needle, so that samples from a fluid being led through the tube (1) can be taken. The body (6) is form-closely received in a hollow (19) in the wall (4) by means of its sealing elements (16, 17, 18). Due to the form-closed sealing elements (16, 17, 18) it is extraordinary difficult to mount the body (6) in the hollow (19) of the wall (4), and therefore a suitable method of producing the tube (1) is provided, where the body (6) is initially moulded whereupon the plastic which is to constitute the tube (1) is moulded round the body (6). For implementation of the method a tool (20) is provided which consists of an upper portion (20a) and a lower portion (20b), as the body (6) is initially moulded in the upper portion (20a) whereupon the portions (20a, 20b) are turned relatively 180  and the tube (1) is moulded round the body (6). Thus manual handling of the body (6) between its production and its moulding round by the tube (1) as well as some form of intermediate mechanical movement is avoided, which may contaminate the surface of the body (6), which may subsequently result in sealing problems.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a tube of plastic comprising a
tube wall with an insertion end, an intermediate portion,
and a receiving end, which tube is adapted to connect a
hose to a spigot end, especially for medical use, and
where the intermediate portion has a elastic deformable
and pierceable body arranged in an aperture in the tube
wall, which body along its circumference has sealing elements
concurring with the tube, which sealing elements
comprise a wall projecting radially from the circumference
of the body and a flange projecting from the edge of
the wall which flange extends a short distance in the direction
of the inner wall of the intermediate portion of
the tube and further comprising holding means for surrounding
and securing wall and the flange of the body in
relation to the intermediate portion of the tube.Furthermore, the invention relates to a method of producing
the tube as well as a tool for implementation of the
method of producing several of the mentioned tubes.For medical use it is common practise that several devices
are to be connected with each other in order to
produce a flow passage for a fluid, such as a liquid or a
gas. The devices are thus provided with coupling elements
which are firmly mounted on the individual device.The coupling elements often comprise an insertion portion
in the form of a tube on the one device and a receiving
portion on the second device.The insertion portion is configured as a short tube having
a tapered end, and the receiving portion is configured 
as a muff the bore of which converges conically inwards
towards the device. The size of the mentioned tapered
parts is adapted to the material of the coupling
elements in such a manner that the parts can remain in
their coupled position by means of friction or gluing.In order to avoid an exact alignment of the coupling elements
on two devices that are to be coupled together generally
hoses are used to connect the coupling elements.During application of the devices it is often necessary
to take a sample of a fluid being transported from one
device to another or to add a substance or liquid to the
mentioned fluid.In this connection it must be ensured that no fluid leaks
out or that the fluid is not contaminated during such
tests or injections. This object is achieved by sticking
a hypodermic needle point into the flow passage.The applied hoses are, however, of such a kind or such
material that piercing by a hypodermic needle is not advisable.Consequently, a tube of plastic has been used, which tube
has an
