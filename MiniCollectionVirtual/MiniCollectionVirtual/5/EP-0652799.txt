<ABSTRACT>
Described are terminal-group-closed anti-foaming agents obtained by esterifying with carboxylic acids, in the presence of acid catalysts, fatty-alcohol polyglycol ethers of formula (I) in which R1 is a straight-chain or branched-chain aliphatic hydrocarbon group with 1 to 22 carbon atoms and 0, 1, 2 or 3 double bonds, R2 is hydrogen or a methyl group and n is a number from 1 to 40. The products are suitable for use as anti-foaming agents in a large number of applications.

<CLAIMS>
The use of end-capped antifoam agents obtainable by 
esterification of fatty alcohol polyglycol ethers corresponding 

to formula (I): 

 
in which R
1
 is an aliphatic, linear or branched hydrocarbon 
radical containing 1 to 22 carbon atoms and 0, 1, 2 

or 3 double bonds, R
2
 is hydrogen or a methyl group and n 
is a number of 1 to 40,
 
with carboxylic acids in the presence of acidic catalysts,
 
for foam control in laundry detergents, dishwashing 

detergents and cleaning products, paints and lacquers, as 
auxiliaries for the sugar and yeast industry and in the 

wastewater treatment of sewage plants. 
The use claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 
fatty alcohol polyglycol ethers corresponding to formula 


(I)
, in which R
1
 represents C
2-18
 alkyl radicals, R
2
 is 
hydrogen and n is a number of 2 to 10, are used. 
The use claimed in claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in 
that
 aliphatic or aromatic, optionally hydroxy-substituted 
carboxylic acids containing 6 to 22 carbon atoms are 

used. 
The use claimed in claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in 
that
 mineral acids, sulfonic acids or acidic ion exchangers 
are used as the acidic catalysts.
