<ABSTRACT>
A blood vessel clamp has a pair of arms (2, 4) each supporting a respective jaw (8, 12). The arms are pivotally interconnected by a box joint (26) formed by an intermediate portion (22) of one arm (2) extending through a slot in an intermediate portion of the other arm (4) and imprisoned therein by a pivot pin (28). The internal wall of the slot is provided with a protrusion (30) at a location remote from the pin (28) such that as a part (32) of the intermediate arm (22) enters the slot during the last stages of closure of the jaws (8, 12) it engages the protrusion (30) and forces the opposite walls of the slot apart against their own resilience. This creates an increased stiffness in the joint (26) so that the jaws will remain in any desired position until a predetermined force is applied to overcome the stiffness whereupon they can be moved to a new position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to blood vessel
clamps.Blood vessel clamps are used in surgical
procedures to reduce or cut off the blood flow or supply
in veins or arteries.Such clamps, known for example from EP-A-0218544,
conventionally consist of scissor-like structures
having mating gripping jaws instead of cutting blades. In
addition a ratchet mechanism is provided on each arm. The
two ratchet mechanisms engage during the last stages of
approach between the two jaws so as to prevent the jaws
from moving apart. Each ratchet mechanism is in the form
of a projection extending from one arm of the clamp at a
position adjacent the finger hole, towards the other arm
of the clamp. The leading edge of each arm is so profiled
that when the two edges engage they are displaced away
from one another in a direction normal to the direction of
motion so that the lower surface of one projection can
then ride over the upper surface of the other projection,
as the two projections continue to move towards one
another. The two facing surfaces of the projections are
each provided with a saw-tooth profile. The saw teeth
interlock with one another and prevent the two projections
moving away from one another but allow continued movement
towards one another to increase the number of the teeth of
the two portions interlocking with one another. Thus a
series of spaced discrete locking positions is achieved as
the two jaws move together. To release the teeth from one
another, the two projections must be first moved towards
one another to a position intermediate the adjacent
locking positions and then displaced in perpendicular
direction to cause the two sets of teeth to disengage one
another before the arms of the clamp can be moved apart.Such clamps have serious disadvantages. In use 
when a blood vessel is held between the jaws, the blood
flow is monitored as the jaws are closed. When the blood
flow reaches the desired level or stops, the jaws usually
need to be closed further to reach the nearest locking
position. Furthermore, to unlock the jaws, the jaws have
to be closed tighter still before the ratchet mechanisms
can be disengaged. This results in a greater pressure
being applied to the vessel than is necessary and this can
lead to damage of the vessels particularly if there has
been a build up inside the vessel of calcium or other
material. Still further, the crushing or fragmentation of
such a build up may mean that the fragments are
subsequently released into the blood supply system with
the consequent danger of a

<CLAIMS>
A blood vessel clamp comprising a pair of arms,
a pair of jaws (8,12) provided on the arms (2,4) and

having facing surfaces which co-operate to grip a blood
vessel, a pivotal connection (28) for pivotally connecting

the arms (2,4) enabling the jaws (8,12) to move angularly
into and out of mating engagement with each other,

characterised in that means (30) are provided for
increasing the stiffness against relative angular movement

to at least a predetermined value during the final
approach of the jaws (8,12) before they engage one

another, to hold the jaws (8,12) more tightly in any
desired position in said final approach, until released in

response to a predetermined pressure sufficient to
overcome the stiffness.
A clamp according to Claim 1, characterised in
that the pivotal connection (28) connects the arms (2,4)

such that they cross over one another at a position
intermediate their ends.
A clamp according to Claim 2, characterised in
that said pivotal connection (28) comprises a box joint

(26) in which an intermediate portion (22) of one arm (2)

extends into an elongate slot in an intermediate portion
(24) of the other arm (4) and including a common pivot pin

(30) extending through both said intermediate portions
(22,24)
A clamp according to Claim 3, characterised in
that the stiffness increasing means (30) comprises a

protrusion extending from one of said intermediate
portions (22,24) positioned to engage the other said

intermediate portion (24,22) only during said final
approach travel to force the walls of the slot apart

against their own resilience.
A clamp according to Claim 4, characterised in
that the surface of said other portion which is engaged by 

said protrusion (30) is inclined relative to the surface
supporting the protrusion in a sense such that the

stiffness increases progressively as the jaws approach on
another.
A clamp according to Claim 5, characterised in
that said relative inclination is at least ½°.
A clamp according to Claim 3, characterised in
that one arm (2) and its corresponding jaw are located on

one side of the slot and the other arm and its
corresponding jaw are located on the opposite side of the

slot.
A clamp according to any preceding claim,
characterised in that each arm has a finger hole (10,14)

at an end thereof opposite the jaw (8,12).
A blood vessel clamp according to Claim 1,
characterised in that the pivotal connection pivotally

connects the arms at their ends.
A clamp according to Claim 9, characterised by
means (60) provided on the arms (2,4) for enabling the

clamp to be engaged by a tool (T) for opening and closing
the clamp.
A clamp according to Claim 10, characterised in
that the means (60) enabling the clamp to be engaged by a

tool comprise a pair of rings each pivotally mounted at
the second end of a respective one of the arms remote from

the pivotal connection about an axis parallel to that of
the pivotal connection.
A clamp according to Claim 10 or Claim 11,
characterised in that the pivotal connection comprises a

A clamp according to Claim 10 or to Claim 12,
characterised in that the mating surfaces (2A, 4A) of the

pivotal connection (56) are coated with a layer of
tungsten carbide.
A clamp according to any preceding claim
characterised by including a silicon rubber sleeve (34) on

each said jaw (8,12).
