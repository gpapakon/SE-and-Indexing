<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to CORDIC algorithms and architectures. 
The CORDIC (COordinate Rotation DIgital Computer) algorithm 
was presented by Volder, "The CORDIC trigonometric computing 
technique", IRE Transactions on electronic computers, pages 330-334, 
September 1959, as an elegant and cost-effective method to 
perform rotations on vectors in the 2-D plane. Walther, "A unified 
algorithm for elementary functions", Proceedings of the AFIPS 
Spring Joint Computer Conference, pages 379-385, 1971, extended the 
algorithm to rotations in circular, linear and hyperbolic coordinate 
systems. Since then, many implementations of the CORDIC have 
been made, both for fixed-point and floating-point with respect to 
the input. CORDIC computing techniques are widely used in e.g. navigation 
where course angles have to be corrected and distance-to-destination 
relationships in great circle steering have to be solved. 
However, the magnitude and phase of a complex number may also be 
approximated by a CORDIC, EP-A-0.365.226. Also, a CORDIC may be an 
element in a filter arrangement to detect phase differences, EP-A-0.481.543. 
A digital receiver comprising a CORDIC is described in 
EP-A-0.486.095. Generally spoken, a CORDIC may be used in any technical 
field in which an input vector has to be rotated to an output 
vector. The main drawback in the computations with floating-point 
data with the classic CORDIC algorithm lies with the inherent 
fixed-point resolution of the angle. The accuracy, especially when 
calculating angles close to or smaller than the angle resolution, 
becomes unacceptable. Therefore, in applications using a CORDIC 
there is a need to enhance the accuracy of the output data of the 
CORDIC in order not to loose any precision by the use of CORDIC's. The object of the present invention is to provide CORDIC 
architectures and algorithms that overcome the problems of the 
prior art. In accordance with the present invention the object is 
obtained by a CORDIC arrangement to rotate an input vector (xin, 
yin) over an angle α to an output vector (xout, yout), characterized 
in that xin, yin, xout, yout are represented by floating-point numbers  
 
with respective mantissas (mx, my) and respective angle exponents 
(ex, ey) and the CORDIC arrangement comprises: 
(a) a pre-rotation unit receiving the input vector (xin, yin) to 
rotate the input vector (xin, yin) over an angle βpre to give 
a vector (xpre, ypre); (b) a core receiving the vector (xpre, ypre) from the pre-rotation 
unit to rotate
