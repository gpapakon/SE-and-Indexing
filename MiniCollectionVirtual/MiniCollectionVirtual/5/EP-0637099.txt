<ABSTRACT>
In the case of this rail-mounted terminal assembly having two or more rail-mounted terminals (terminal blocks) (1) which are arranged side by side, overvoltage protection devices (2) are used whose contact elements (8) make contact on one side with the busbar (4) of the rail-mounted terminal and on the other side make contact with a busbar (5) which passes through the rail-mounted terminal assembly. Spring elements (6) which, if required, can be arranged separately in the insulating material housing of the rail-mounted terminals, and which make contact directly, are now provided in order to make contact in this way.

A modular terminal arrangement comprising two or more modular
terminals (1) with inserted overvoltage protection members (2) and a bus bar

(3, 5) which carries an earth potential and which extends transversely with
respect to the juxtaposed modular terminals (1) in the direction in which

they are arranged in a row with each other, wherein a contact element (8) of
each overvoltage protection member (2) is electrically connected to the bus

bar (3, 5) and a further contact element (8) of each overvoltage protection
member (2) is electrically connected to the current bar (4) in the

respective modular terminal (1), characterised in that the contact elements
(8) of the overvoltage protection members (2) respectively directly

electrically contact the bus bar (3, 5) and the current bars (4) of the
modular terminals (1) and that to produce the mechanical contact force there

are provided spring elements (6) which have a U-shaped main body (20) and
two mutually oppositely disposed spring limbs (21 and 22) which are extended

at one side beyond the main body and which in turn are resiliently fitted on
to the bus bar (3, 5) and the current bars (4) and with which the contact

elements (8) are pressed against the bus bar (3, 5) and the current bars
(4).
A modular terminal arrangement according to claim 1 characterised
in that the spring limbs (21, 22) are curved convexly towards each other at

their ends which are remote from the main body (20).
A modular terminal arrangement according to claim 1 characterised
in that the bus bar carrying the earth potential is formed by a carrier bar

(3) on which a contact foot (30) of the modular terminal (1) is fixed and a
contact element (8) of the overvoltage protection member (2) directly

electrically contacts a contact tongue (32) of the contact foot (30) and is
pressed resiliently thereagainst by means of the spring element (6).
A modular terminal arrangement according to claim 1 or claim 2
characterised in that the spring element (6) for producing the contact force

between the contact element (8) of the overvoltage protection member (2) and
the bus bar (5) is arranged in the connecting plane of the modular terminal

(1).
