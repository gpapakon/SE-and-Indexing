<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for forming a head (12) having 
a controlled pre-determined shape on an end of an elongate 

member (14), such as a wire, which is subsequently formed 
into a fastener. A portion of the wire (14) is secured in 

a pre-determined position and an end portion (22) is 
axially compressed to radially, outwardly expand it to 

form the head (12). Material flow is directed and 
controlled during axial compression, for example by flow 

control channels (30), to provide a controlled pre-determined 
shape for the head (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a method and
apparatus for forming a head for a fastener, and more
particularly to a method and apparatus for axially
compressing an end portion of a wire to outwardly expand a
predetermined amount of wire material to form the head on
the wire.Typically, to form a fastener such as a nail, an end
portion of a wire is axially compressed with a punch or the
like with sufficient force to radially outwardly expand the
end portion of the wire to form a head thereon. The
opposite end of the wire then is formed into a point to
provide the finished nail.During axial compression of the wire, the wire
material tends to randomly outwardly expand without
control. This random expansion typically results in a nail
head that is slightly out of round and/or off-centre with
respect to the central axis of the wire shank, as
illustrated in FIG. 6. Such a nail can be a problem when
utilized in a power nailer causing tumbling or jamming of the nails therein.From FR-A-2403844 a method according to the preamble of claim 1 and an
apparatus according to the preamble of claim 4 are known.According to a first aspect of this invention a method
of forming a head on an elongate member comprises
the features of claim 1. 
According to a second aspect of this invention an apparatus
for forming a head on an elongate member, comprises the features
of claim 4.Particular examples of a method, apparatus and
resulting fasteners will now be described and contrasted
with the prior art with reference to the accompanying
drawings, in which:-
FIG. 1 is a perspective view, in partial section, of
a head forming punch of the invention and an end portion of
a wire before punching;FIG. 2 is a perspective view, in partial section, of
the head forming punch of the invention after a punching
operation illustrating the head formed on the wire;FIG. 3 is an enlarged side elevational view of an end
of a wire captured within a holding die, illustrated in
partial section, prior to punching with the punch of the
invention;FIG. 4 is a top plan view of the end portion of the
wire and die taken along line 4-4 of FIG. 3 illustrating a
ridge of material typically included on the end of the wire
before punching;FIG. 5 is a top plan view of the head forming punch
taken along line 5-5 of FIG. 3 illustrating the flow
control channels thereof with the end portion of the wire
in dotted outline illustrating the position of the wire with respect to
the punch before punching; FIG. 6 is a top plan view of a prior art nail having
a head

<CLAIMS>
A method of forming a head (12) on an elongate member
(14), by holding the elongate member (14) at a

predetermined position and axially compressing an end
portion (22,26) of the elongate member (14) to radially,

outwardly expand the end portion (22, 26) by a punch (16) against a die (18,20),
characterised in that the end portion

(22,26) initially has a raised ridge of material (26),
at least one of the

punch (16) and die (18,20) including a linear channel (30)
to control the amount and direction of the flow of material

of the elongate member (14) and arranged at a predetermined
angle relative to the raised ridge of material (26) to form

the head (12) centred substantially on the longitudinal
axis of the elongate member (14) and with a circular shape.
A method according to claim 1, in which said at least
one of the punch (16) and die (18,20) includes a plurality

of generally parallel linear channels (30).
A method according to claim 1 or 2,
in which the or each linear channel (30) is

arranged generally in parallel to the ridge (26) during the
axial compression.
An apparatus for forming a head (12) on an elongate
member (14),

a holding means for holding the elongate
member (14) at a predetermined position, a punch (16)

for
axially compressing an end portion (22,26) of the elongate

member (14) to radially, outwardly expand the end portion
(22,26) and a die (18,20) against which the expanded end

portion (22,26) is pressed characterised in that
the apparatus further comprises a cutter for cutting

the elongate member (14) and forming a raised ridge (26) on
the cut end, and in that at least

one of the punch (16) and die (18,20) includes a linear
channel (30) to control the amount and direction of the 

flow of material of the elongate member (14) to form the
head (12) centred substantially on the longitudinal axis of

the elongate member (14) and with a circular shape, said at least one
of the punch (16) and die (18,20) being so arranged that the linear

channel (30) is at a predetermined angle with respect to the
raised ridge (26) formed on the elongate member (14).
An apparatus as defined in claim 4, in which said at
least one of the punch (16) and die (18,20) includes a

plurality of generally parallel linear channels (30).
