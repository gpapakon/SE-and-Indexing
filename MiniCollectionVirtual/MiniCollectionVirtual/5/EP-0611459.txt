<ABSTRACT>
The system comprises a machine tool (1) with an associated computerised numerical control system (7) and a CAD work station (9) of interactive graphic type. This includes an electronic processing unit (11) arranged to determine, on the basis of a mathematical model of the shape to be formed and the nominal geometrical characteristics of the blank work piece (4), the coordinates of the points which define the paths intended to be followed by the tool (6) for working the blank work piece (4), and for transmitting to the numerical control system (7) of the machine (1) the coordinates of the points of the said paths, gradually as they are calculated, for their immediate execution by the machine (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tool working system, 
in particular a grinding system, for producing a 
workpiece such as a die for a motor vehicle body part, 
starting from a die blank of predetermined nominal shape 
and dimensions. In current known methods for the 
production of such a die, the design is first drawn up 
and, then, a mathematical model thereof is defined, for 
example by means of currently available modern CAD 
(Computer Aided Design) instruments. The mathematical model, usually integrated with the shape 
of any possible ancillary surfaces (surfaces outside the 
drawing) is utilised for the subsequent generation of a 
part program and for definition of the track or path 
intended to be followed by the tool of the machine 
utilised. This path is defined in relation to the 
nominal dimensions of the die blank from which the 
desired shape is to be formed by working with the tool, 
the type of tool provided, the acceptable tolerance 
limits, the type of tool movements etc. Once the programme relating to the tool path has been set 
us and checked this is transferred in the workshop to the 
numerical control system of the machine tool used. The  
 
working can then be started. In the above described traditional method it can happen 
that the preliminarily programmed path of the tool is not 
entirely adequate effectively to produce the desired 
shape. This may be for example because of the fact that 
the die blank used has dimensional characteristics which 
depart from the nominal characteristics taken into 
consideration in programming the path. This may mean for 
example that in order to produce the desired shape the 
machine must remove a greater amount of stock than that 
envisaged. With the traditional method it is then necessary in this 
case to suspend working and proceed to re-programming of 
the working in such a way as to take into account the 
detected differences or errors or possibly other 
indications deriving from the operator's experience of 
the machine. Often the suspension of working also 
involves discarding the die blank from the machine, from 
where this can possibly be used for other purposes whilst 
re-programming of the tool path proceeds. Once this re-programming 
is finished the renewed numerically 
controlled working then generally requires a new loading 
and repositioning of a die blank into the machine. In such cases the re-programming of the numerically  
 
controlled working may take place after a damaging event 
has occurred, such as damage to the die

A tool working system, in particular a grinding 
system, for the production of a workpiece such as a die 

for a motor vehicle body part, starting from a blank 
workpiece (4) of predefined nominal shape and dimensions, wherein 

the system
