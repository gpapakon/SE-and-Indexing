<ABSTRACT>
In photographic processing apparatus, 
different processing solutions are normally contained 

in separate tanks, the material being processed as it 
passes from one tank to another through the required 

processing stages. This means that the apparatus 
needs to have a tank for each solution which is 

required for a particular process. Described herein 
is an arrangement (50) in which more than one 

processing tank may be provided in a single container. 
The arrangement (50) comprises tray (64) which is 

divided into two portions (66, 68) by barrier means 
(70, 72, 74, 76, 78), each portion (66, 68) containing 

a different processing solution. The barrier means 
(70, 72, 74, 76, 78) includes an air bubble (78) 

retained on the underside of a curved member (74) 
which is maintained in a central position due to the 

liquid pressure on each side of the barrier means (70, 
72, 74, 76, 78).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the 
separation of liquids and is more particularly, 
although not exclusively, concerned with the 
separation of liquids in photographic processing 
apparatus. In photographic processing apparatus, 
different processing solutions are contained in 
separate tanks, the material being processed as it 
passes from one tank to another through the required 
processing stages. This means that the apparatus 
needs to have a separate tank for each solution which 
is required for a particular process - for example, a 
tank for each of the developer, bleach, fix (or 
combined bleach/fix) and wash stages, the material 
being processed making contact with the air as it 
passes from one tank to the next. Moreover, such processing apparatus usually 
comprises more than one washing stage and hence there 
is a requirement for a separate wash tank for each of 
the washing stages. As a result, such processing 
apparatus tend to be large and cumbersome. US-A-3 824 616 describes an automatic film 
processor which comprises a plurality of treatment 
tanks and a transport system for transporting a sheet 
of film through the tanks in succession. In this 
processor, the film sheet enters the air as it crosses 
over from one tank to another. A guide structure is 
provided between adjacent tanks to guide the film 
sheet as it passes through the air between the 
adjacent tanks. The film sheet is processed with its 
emulsion surface outermost. A positive air pressure 
is produced adjacent the interior of the guide  
 
structure to urge the sheet of film away therefrom to 
minimise faulty processing and scratching of the 
emulsion surface of the film sheet. Although US-A-3 824 616 describes a 
processor which overcomes the problem of the film 
sheet making contact with the guide structure as it 
crosses over from one tank to the next, the processor 
is still large and requires several separate tanks. GB-A-1 292 004 discloses a compact processor 
in which the processing tanks are nested within one 
the other. The processor comprises a first container 
mounted on a support and a second container positioned 
within the first container but spaced therefrom to 
define a processing tank therebetween. One processing 
solution is contained in the processing tank defined 
by the walls of the two containers, and a second 
different processing solution is contained in the 
second container. A cross-over arrangement is 
provided so that the material being processed can pass 
from the first container and the
