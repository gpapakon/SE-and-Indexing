<ABSTRACT>
Light of an observation wavelength range is irradiated upon a sample object to 
measure spectral reflection ratios, and an waveform is developed from the spectral 

reflection ratios. Based on the total number of peaks and valleys found in the 
interference waveform and two wavelengths specified within the observation 

wavelength range, possible ranges for the film thicknesses of the respective 
transparent films are determined. While changing tentative film thicknesses of the 

respective transparent films each by a predetermined film thickness pitch within the 
film thickness ranges, a deviation between theoretical spectral reflectance and 

measured spectral reflectance with respect to the tentative film thicknesses is 
calculated to thereby find a film thickness combination which causes the deviation 

to be minimum.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a non-contact and non-destructive measurement
method of measuring film thicknesses of one or more transparent films of a sample
object which is to be measured (hereinafter "sample object") in which the one or
more transparent films are stacked on a substrate.To measure a film thickness of a transparent film of a sample object in which
the transparent film is disposed on a substrate, a measurement method utilizing
spectral reflectances is previously known. In this measurement method (hereinafter
"first conventional method"), a sample object is irradiated with light of a certain
observation wavelength range. Spectral reflectances for the sample object are
measured to obtain an interference waveform. The number of peaks and valleys
in the interference waveform and wavelengths corresponding to the peaks and
valleys are then identified, and the film thickness d is calculated from these data.
More specifically, the film thickness d is calculated as:
d = 0.25 × m-1n1λ1 - n2λ2
where
λ1:the wavelength of a peak or a valley of the shorter wavelength sideλ2:the wavelength of a peak or a valley of the longer wavelength side n1:the refraction index of the transparent film at the wavelength λ1n2:the refraction index of the transparent film at the wavelength λ2m:the total number of the peaks and the valleys in the observation wavelength
rangeHowever, if the sample object is formed by a plurality of transparent films which
are stacked one atop the other on a substrate, it is impossible to measure the film
thicknesses of the transparent films by the first conventional method. When light
is irradiated upon the multilayered sample object and spectral reflectances are
measured, interference within and between the transparent films are included in the
measured spectral reflectances.To deal with this, techniques for measuring film thicknesses of transparent films
of a multilayered sample object have been developed in recent years. One example
is a technique disclosed by United States Patent No. 4,999,509 (hereinafter "second
conventional method"). In the second conventional method, film thickness ranges
for the respective transparent films are inputted in advance, and the film thicknesses
of the transparent films of the multilayered sample object are calculated by global
optimization and local optimization.Thus, when a sample object includes only one transparent film disposed on a
substrate, the film thickness of the transparent film is measured by the first
conventional method. On the other

wavelength which is related to a peak or a valley which is
located on the longer wavelength side in said interference
