<ABSTRACT>
A load lock interface (32) for a semiconductor wafer 
process chamber includes a platform (31) adapted to receive 

and engage with a carrier (20) containing a cassette (23) 
of semiconductor wafers (24); and a removable bell-shaped 

enclosure (12) adapted to surround and seal said carrier 
(20) from the ambient environment while the carrier (20) is 

engaged with the load lock interface platform (31). Once 
engaged with the carrier (20), the platform (31) is 

operable to withdraw the cassette (23) of wafers (24) from 
the carrier (20) and position the cassette (23) within a 

load lock (30). Thereafter, the cassette (23) may be 
indexed and individual wafers (24) may be removed from the 

cassette (23) for processing within the process chamber.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the handling and processing of semiconductor
wafers. More particularly, the present invention relates to loading and
unloading a cassette of wafers in a wafer processing chamber.Semiconductor wafer handling and processing have always required extreme
care to avoid contamination due to ambient and process borne particles. Such
contamination lowers process yields, thus making the manufacture of integrated
circuits more expensive and time consuming. Thus, as device features of less
than 0.5 µm become prevalent, a clean room environment of less than class 1,
i.e. an environment having less than one contaminant particle of dimension less
than or equal to 0.5 µm per 0.3m3 (ft3) of clean room volume, is generally
required.At the present level of integration, semiconductor processes are critically
sensitive to any contamination. Accordingly, one goal of semiconductor 
manufacturers is to avoid as much as possible exposing semiconductor wafers
to sources of contamination. Class 1 conditions require that processed or
partially processed wafers must be bagged when transported to subsequent
processing facilities or to outside analysis or other systems. Industry practice is
to place semiconductor wafers in spaced stacks, referred to as cassettes, and to
place these cassettes into various types of microenvironments, such as sealed
containers, for example in the standard mechanical interface (SMIF) box of the
type manufactured by Asyst Technologies, Inc. of Milpitas, California. Such
SMIF-type boxes provide a sealed environment in which the cassette is readily
transported under conditions that tend to minimize the potential for wafer
contamination. The interior of the SMIF-type box is typically sealed by placing
a removable base or lid on the box to form an integrated, airtight assembly.
Withdrawal of the cassette from the SMIF-type box for wafer loading/unloading
is accomplished by several different methods, for example a pressure
differential may be provided at the base of the SMIF-type box, such that the
base and cassette of wafers is pulled from the SMIF-type box, or the base of the
SMIF-type box may be mechanically engaged with a platform and/or support,
etc. In this way, wafer exposure to the ambient environment is reduced during
wafer handling, thus limiting the possibility that particles can fall onto and
contaminate the wafers. See, for example Bonora et al (U.S. Patent No.
4,995,430) and Mortensen et al (U.S. Patent Nos. 4,709,834 and 4,582,219).Another opportunity for wafer
