<ABSTRACT>
Four stroke internal combustion engine, of high mechanical 
simplicity, wherein the piston skirt (5) of each cylinder (1) is 

separated from the latter and rotates in touch with the internal surface 
of said cylinder, without axial translation, at a speed equal to half 

the speed of the crankshaft (7) of the engine, a port or window (8) at 
least being provided on said rotating skirt, the size and location of 

said port or window being such as to be caused to coincide, during the 
rotation, with analogous intake and exhaust openings (9) correspondingly 

provided on said cylinder; the rotation of said skirt being obtained by 
drive gearings placed between said crankshaft and the lower end of said 

skirt, so as to allow, through the continuous rotation of said skirt at 
half the speed of the crankshaft, the realization of the four phases of 

the four-stroke cycle.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a "Otto" or "Diesel"-cycle 
four-stroke internal combustion engine, having one or 
more cylinders however orientated, so designed and 
structurated as to be of very simple construction, 
capable of delivering a specific power and a number of 
rotations much higher than those that can be obtained - 
the cylinder capacity being the same - from the traditional 
valve engines; and this to weights and costs 
remarkably lower and with the advantage of emitting 
exhaust gases having a very low pollution degree. As is known, the present mechanical engineering for 
internal combustion engines provides substantially for 
two types of engines, namely four-stroke engines and 
two-stroke engines, utilizing either the Otto or the 
Diesel cycle. It is also known that four-stroke engines have many and 
great advantages relatively to the two-stroke engine; 
actually, gasoline four-stroke engines have a higher 
thermodynamical yield, a good cleanness as concerns 
exhaust gases, lower consumption and greater noiselessness 
compared to two-stroke engines which utilize as 
fuel a gasoline-oil mixture; anyhow, all these advantages 
involve a greater mechanical complexity, which in 
practice brings about an increase in weight and higher 
costs. Two stroke engines, on the contrary, have only the  
 
advantage of being structurally simpler and of delivering 
a power greater that that delivered by four-stroke 
valve engines, which is obviosuly due to the fact that 
two-stroke engines - rotations being the same - have a 
double number of active phases, i.e. of explosions. The application field of two-stroke engines is substantially 
limited to low displacement engines, where 
technical simplicity, low cost and low weight prevail; 
while four-stroke engines, usually the multicylinder 
ones, are largely used for means that require high 
power, such as motor-cars, transport motor-vehicles, 
racing-cars, and in all those cases where cost, mechanical 
complexity and weight are largely justified by 
the performances of these engines. The attemps that have been made up to now to reduce the 
mechanical complexity and the weight of four-stroke 
valve engines do not appear to have brought about 
technically and practically acceptable results, such as 
to justify their utilization instead of the traditional 
two-stroke engines. On the other hand, the mechanical-structural complexity 
of four-stroke engines, however improved, for instance 
through the adoption of head camshafts in order to 
eliminate tappets, is

<CLAIMS>
Four-stroke internal combustion engine with one or 
more cylinders, having a simplified structure, characterized 

in that it provides for the piston skirt of 
each cylinder to be separated from said cylinder and to 

rotate in touch with the internal surface of said 
cylinder, without axial translation, at a speed equal 

to half the speed of the engine crankshaft, at least a 
port or window being provided on said rotatory skirt, 

which port or window is so sized and located as to 
allow its being caused, during the rotation, to coincide 

with analogous intake and exhaust openings correspondingly 
provided on the cylinder, the rotation of 

said skirt being obtained by gearings means placed 
between said crakshaft and the lower end of said skirt, 

so as to allow, through the continuous rotation of said 
skirt at half the rotation speed of the crankshaft, the 

realization of the four phases of the four-stroke 
cycle. 
Engine according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said gearing means for the transmission of motion to 

said skirt are constituted by a couple of conical 
gearings, one of which is co-axially integral with said 

skirt and the other is axially integral with said 
crankshaft. 
Engine according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the gearing of said conical couple integral with the 

 
skirt has a number of teeth wich is twice the number of 

teeth of the other gearing, in order to allow the skirt 
to rotate at half the speed of the crankshaft. 
Engine according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said skirt port has a substantially rectangular shape, 

with its bent side horizontal and transversal relatively 
to the cylinder axis, and such a width as to subtend 

a 45° angle centered on the cylinder axis, the intake 
and exhaust ports provided in the cylinder having also 

a rectangular shape, with an horizontal side such as to 
subtend a 45° angle. 
Engine according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that it is realizable also in 

the case of several cylinders however placed relatively 
to one another, the rotatory skirt of each of them 

being driven either by an own couple of conical gearings 
or by direct engagement of the gearings of the 

individual skirts among one another, or also by means 
of an additional gearing placed between the gearings of 

the "even" skirts, in order to allow, in this last 
case, the rotation in the same direction of all the 

skirts. 
Engine according to the preceding claims, characterized 
in that it provides a conducting tang on top of 

each rotatory skirt, which tang protrudes towards the 

inside of said skirt, and is suitable to allow the 
formation of the ignition sparkles in the combustion 

 
phases, during the rotation of the relevant skirt, due 

to the brushing of the tang against the end of the 
central electrode of the ignition plug, the positioning 

of said tang being so adjusted as to allow the realization 
of the ignition advance, relatively to the piston 

upper dead point, as required according to each case. 
Engine according to the preceding claims, characterized 
in that it provides for the delivery, between 

said electrode and said tang integral with the rotatory 
skirt, of an arc electric current capable of causing 

the rotation of said engine in the idle and neutral 
conditions by electrical energy only, in absence of 

fuel, and therefore with no pollution at all. 
Rotatory skirt engine according to the preceding 
claims, characterized in that it is so designed as to 

be suitable not only for four-stroke engines, but also 
for micro-engines for models and the like. 
Rotatory skirt engine according to the preceding 
claims, characterized in that it provides above the 

upper dead point of each rotatory skirt cylinder at 
least a fin or the like, substantially a partly helical 

blade, coming out from the skirt's internal part and 
horizontally placed above the intake ports, so as to 

allow a substantial optimization of the mixing of the 
sucked mix. 
Rotatory skirt engine according to the preceding 
claims, characterized in that it provides several 

 
intake ports substantially upwards bents, suitable to 

promote the formation of an obliquous vortex of the 
sucked components, and therefore a substantial reduction 

in the unburnt components in exhaust gases.
