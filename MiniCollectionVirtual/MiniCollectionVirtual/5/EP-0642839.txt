<ABSTRACT>
Method of storing and dispensing a fluid product (P) held in a container pressurised using a propellent gas (G), the container (2) comprising two compartments (3, 4) separated by a movable partition wall (5), a first compartment (3) containing the fluid product (P) and being in communication with a valve (6) for dispensing the product (P) and the second compartment (4) containing the propellent gas (G), by which the propellent gas (G) at a pressure P1 is brought into the second compartment (4), making it possible to dispense the fluid product (P) by acting on the dispensing valve (6), dispensing is carried out and the pressure in the second compartment (4) is lowered down to atmospheric pressure, the pressure in the compartment (4) being brought back to a pressure making it possible to dispense the product (P) only just before the next dispensing operation.

Method for packaging and dispensing a fluid 
product (P) contained in a receptacle (2, 102) which is 

pressurized with the aid of a propellant gas (G), the 
receptacle (2, 102) including two compartments (3, 103; 

4, 104) which are separated by a moving partition 
(5, 105), a first compartment (3, 103) containing the 

fluid product (P) and being in communication with a valve 
(6, 106) for dispensing the product (P) and the second 

compartment (4, 104) containing the propellant gas (G) 
and equipped with a device for letting the pressurized 

propellant gas in, and with a device for depressurizing 
the propellant gas, characterized in that in the second 

compartment (4, 104), before each dispensing act, the 
propellant gas (G) is brought to a pressure P1 allowing 

the fluid product (P) to be dispensed by action on the 
dispensing valve (6), that dispensing is carried out, 

lowering the pressure in the second compartment (4, 104) 
to atmospheric pressure by virtue of a leakage of 

propellant gas (G) between the second compartment 
(4, 104) and the atmosphere during the dispensing of the 

product, and after the step of dispensing the product, 
the leakage flow rate of the propellant gas (G) being 

chosen such that sufficient dispensing time is available, 
the pressure in the compartment (4, 104) not being 

brought back up to a pressure allowing dispensing of the 
product (P) until just before the next dispensing act. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the propellant gas (G) is compressed air. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that the dispensing time is from 1 to 10 

minutes. 
Device for packaging and dispensing a fluid 
product (P) including a receptacle (2, 102) which is 

pressurized with the aid of a propellant gas (G), the 
receptacle (2, 102) including two compartments (3, 103 

and 4, 104) which are separated by a moving partition 
(5, 105), the first compartment (3, 103) containing the 

fluid product (P) to be dispensed and communicating with  
 

a dispensing valve (6, 106) carried by the receptacle 
(2, 102) and the second compartment (4, 104) containing 

the propellant gas (G), the wall of the second compartment 
(4, 104) carrying a valve (9, 109) for feeding with 

compressed propellant gas (G) and a device for 
depressurizing the propellant gas, characterized in that 

the said depressurization device consists in a leakage 
orifice (22, 23, 24) which does not have any closure 

means and allows the propellant gas (G) to leak into the 
atmosphere. 
Device according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that the moving partition (5) is a piston. 
Device according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that the moving partition (105) is a deformable pouch. 
Device according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that the leakage orifice is a micro-orifice pierced in 

the wall of the compartment (4, 104). 
Device according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that the leakage orifice (22, 23, 24) forms part of the 

valve (9, 109) for feeding with compressed propellant gas 
(G). 
Device according to Claim 8, characterized in 
that the valve (9, 109) for feeding with compressed 

propellant gas (G) is a valve with a shut-off element, in 
which the shut-off element does not rest on its seat in 

a leaktight fashion in the closed position. 
Device according to Claim 9, characterized in 
that the valve (9, 109) for feeding with compressed 

propellant gas (G) includes an elastic shut-off element 
interacting with a seat and a groove is formed in the 

shut-off element and/or the seat so as to create the 
leakage orifice between the shut-off element and its seat 

in the closed position. 
Device according to Claim 10, characterized in 
that the shut-off element is made up of an elastic 

membrane (18) interacting with a rigid body (19), the 
elastic membrane (18) being provided with an orifice (22) 

and the rigid body (19) being provided with a duct (23), 
a groove (24) being formed in the rigid body (19) so as  

 
to place the orifice (22) and the duct (23) in communication 

even when the valve is in the closed position.
