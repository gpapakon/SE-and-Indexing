<ABSTRACT>
The high pressure metal halide lamp has in a light transmitting discharge vessel (1) 
tungsten electrodes (3) and a filling comprising a rare gas, a buffer gas and at least one 

halide chosen from hafnium and zirconium bromide and chloride. The filling comprises 
furthermore a metal chosen from tin, tantalum and antimony in elementary form and is 

free from iodine in an amount exceeding 0.5 µmol I/cm₃ discharge space (2). The lamp 
has considerably improved light generating properties.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a high pressure metal halide lamp comprising: 
a light transmitting discharge vessel, enclosing a discharge space, sealed in a 
gas-tight manner, in which tungsten electrodes are disposed, which are connected to 
current conductors which extend to the exterior; a filling in the discharge vessel comprising a rare gas, a buffer gas and 
at least one halide chosen from the halides of hafnium and zirconium. Such a high pressure metal halide lamp is known from EP-0 492 205-A2. The known lamp contains a mixture of halides of one of the metals hafnium and 
zirconium, i.e. a mixture of the iodide and the bromide, particularly in a mol ratio of 
0.2 to 5. Although the known lamp was destined to yield light having a colour 
temperature of between 4000 and 9000 K, the lowest colour temperature described is 
5200 K and the highest 6200 K. The lamp is furthermore destined to have, and has 
indeed, a high colour rendering index Ra and a good R9 index value, indicating a good 
strong-red rendering. The known lamp has a relatively low luminous efficacy of about 70 lm/W at a 
relatively high power consumption of 400 W, although it is generally known that the 
luminous efficacy of a discharge lamp is generally high at relatively high power 
consumption. The life of the known lamp is relatively short, a few hundreds of hours. The known lamp comprises cesium. Cesium is known to lower the reignition 
voltage of discharge lamps, without having a substantial influence on the light 
generated. The lamp may furthermore comprise additives like rare earth metals, cobalt 
and/or nickel in order to improve the quality of the light generated. These additives are 
shown, however, to have a slight influence, only. Other additives investigated are said 
to have no favourable effect.  
 In the non-prepublished European patent application 92 20 36 50.4 (PHN 
14.025) high pressure discharge lamps are described with or without internal electrodes. 
The lamps comprise an halide of hafnium and/or zirconium as the light generating 
species. During operation of the lamps the halide is evaporated and decomposed in a 
high temperature region of the discharge. A supersaturated metal vapour is then formed 
from which metal particles originate by condensation. These particles generate light by 
incandescence. The electroded lamps of this non-prepublished application have a long life as 
compared to electroded discharge lamps having a volatile tungsten compound as the 
light generating species which generates incandescent
