Stand, particularly a keyboard stand, with two interconnected 
double-T-shaped stand sections which are pivotable with a scissor 

movement from a position of rest into an in-use position and with a pivot 
shaft which is associated with a locking ratchet which determines the 

pivoting angle and thus the operating height of the sections of the stand 
and of which a detent element is associated with one stand section while 

the locking element operating in opposition to the force of a spring is 
associated with the other stand section, characterised by the fact that the 

locking ratchet comprises a directional locking mechanism (20) with a 
detent plate (24) which has a number of detent positions (31
1
 to 31
n
) 
while the locking element comprises a detent engaging lever (26) which is 

positioned tangentially to the detent plate (24) and which in the radial 
direction engages the detent positions (31) and with which is associated a 

control member (30) which is mounted to be pivotable between two stops 
(32,33) and by means of which the detent engaging lever is maintained 

disengaged from the detent plate when between the first and the second 
stop and wherein, after movement to the first operating position (31
1
) 
which is associated with stop (32), the detent lever is released for 

engagement with the detent plate (24), the detent lever, after assuming 
final operation position (31
n
) which is defined by the further stop (33) and 
into which the control member (30) is drawn by the detent engaging lever 

(26) being caused to disengage from the detent plate.  
 
Stand according to Claim 1, characterised by the fact that the 
detent plate (24) is located on the inside of a first cup-shaped housing 

plate (21) centred on the pivot shaft (14) of the stand sections (11,12) and 
concentric with the pivot shaft (14), the locking element (detent engaging 

lever) (26) being situated on a similarly constructed second housing plate 
(22) centered on the pivot shaft (14) of the stand sections (11,12) and 

concentric with the pivot shaft (14), each housing plate (21,22) being fixed 
by an outer surface to one of the two stand sections (11,12), the two 

housing plates (21,22), of which one embraces the other, surrounding the 
directional locking mechanism (20). 
Stand according to Claims 1 and 2, characterised by the fact that 
the stops (32,33) for the control member (30) which is mounted on the 

pivot shaft (14) and which causes the detent engaging lever (26) to 
disengage from the detent plate (24) are positioned on that side of the 

detent plate (24) which faces the control member (30) at an angle of 
about 90Â° apart. 
Stand according to Claims 1 to 3, characterised by the fact that the 
pivot shaft (14) is a bearing stub (38) which is rigidly connected with one 

housing plate (21) and on which the other housing plate (22) is pivotably 
mounted and held by a securing device (nut 40). 
Stand according to Claims 1 to 4, characterised by the fact that the 
spring (25) acting on the detent engaging lever (26) is retained by a free  

 
end in an aperture (27) in the housing plate (22). 
Stand according to Claims 1 to 5, characterised by the fact that the 
housing plate (22) bearing the detent engaging lever (26) is provided with 

an aperture (39) facilitating assembly.
