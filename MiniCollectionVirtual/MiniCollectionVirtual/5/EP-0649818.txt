<ABSTRACT>
An improved process for the preparation of nickel hydroxide 
particles is proposed, by which the nickel hydroxide particles 

have an outstandingly spherical particle configuration with a relatively 
narrow particle size distribution to exhibit a high packing 

density of the particles. The nickel hydroxide particles are produced 
by the precipitation reaction for which an aqueous solution of a 

nickel salt, ammonia water and an aqueous solution of a sodium 
hydroxide are concurrently and continuously in
troduced into a reaction 
vessel to form a reaction mixture consisting of the nickel hydroxide 

particles and aqueous medium, from which the aqueous 
medium alone is withdrawn either continuously or intermittently 

so as to accumulate the nickel hydroxide particles in the reaction 
mixture contained in the reaction mixture resulting in growth of 

the nickel hydroxide particles to be imparted with desirable particle 
characteristics.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for the preparation 
of particles of nickel hydroxide. More particularly, the invention 
relates to a method for the preparation of particles of nickel 
hydroxide having well controlled particle size distribution and exhibiting 
a high packing density to be suitable for use, for example, 
in alkali dry cells and the like. Nickel hydroxide particles to be used in the non-sintered 
nickel cathode of an alkali dry cell are used in most cases in the 
form of a paste, by which the metallic pockets of the cathode are 
filled, as mixed with a pasty electroconductive material. It is 
desirable in such an application of nickel hydroxide particles that 
the configuration of the nickel hydroxide particles is spherical or 
close to a spherical configuration and the particles have a smooth 
surface with a relatively uniform particle size distribution because 
the packing density of the nickel hydroxide particles in the 
cathode pockets can be high enough only with such particles. 
Nickel hydroxide particles satisfying such requirements are 
industrially advantageous in order to obtain a high utilization 
factor and a high discharge rate of the dry cells. Needless to say, various attempts and proposals have 
been made with an object to provide a method for the preparation 
of such nickel hydroxide particles. For example, Japanese Patent  
 
Publication 53-6119 and Japanese Patent Kokai 56-143671 and 
61-181074 disclose a method for the preparation of nickel hydroxide 
particles from an aqueous solution of an ammine complex of 
nickel and an aqueous solution of an alkali metal hydroxide. The 
nickel hydroxide formed by the precipitation in this method is obtained 
in a caked form so that disintegration of the cakes into a 
powder is indispensable before use of the nickel hydroxide powder 
which, however, has a broad particle size distribution and an irregular 
particle configuration not to give a high packing density. 
Further, Japanese Patent Kokai 63-16555 and 63-16556 propose a 
method for the preparation of nickel hydroxide in which an aqueous 
solution of a water-soluble nickel salt and an aqueous solution 
of an alkali metal hydroxide are concurrently and continuously introduced 
into a reaction vessel each at a specified rate. One of the 
serious problems in this method is that a stationary state of the reaction 
system can be established only by taking an unduly long 
time which sometimes is as long as one month or even larger. Besides, Japanese Patent Kokai 2-6340
