<ABSTRACT>
Adhesion promoting compositions for bonding a 
layer of organic polymer to a layer of organosiloxane 

elastomer during curing of the elastomer by a platinum group 
metal-catalyzed hydrosilation reaction comprises (a) a 

copolymer containing repeating units derived from at least 
one ethylenically unsaturated organic compound and at least 

one silane containing an ethylenically unsaturated organic 
group and at least two silicon-bonded hydrolyzable groups 

per molecule, and (b) an organohydrogensiloxane containing 
an average of at least three silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms 

per molecule. If the adhesion promoting composition is to 
be used with an elastomer prepared by curing an 

organosiloxane elastomer at temperatures below 80°C., the 
adhesion promoting composition further includes an alkyl 

orthosilicate and an organotitanium compound.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to organosiloxane primer
compositions that cohesively bond organosiloxane elastomers
to organic polymer substrates during curing of the
elastomers by a hydrosilation reaction. These compositions
do not contain the objectionable ingredients required in
prior art compositions to achieve adhesion when the
elastomers are cured by a hydrosilation reaction.A disadvantage that may prevent wide acceptance of
adhesion promoting compositions described in U.S. Patent
Nos. 4,795,775 and 4,719,262 is the toxicity of some
organosilicon compounds containing the bis-silylalkyl group
that can be present in these compositions. Organosilicon
compounds containing the bis-silylethylene group
≡SiCH2CH2Si≡ are particularly undesireable. This
disadvantage has stimulated a search for less toxic
organosiloxane adhesion promoters suitable for use with
organosiloxane elastomers that cure by a hydrosilation
reaction.Primer compositions containing various
combinations of organosilicon compounds, organohydrogensiloxanes,
organotitanates and/or alkyl orthosilicates are
described in the prior art, such as U.S. Patent No.
4,491,650, U.S. Patent No. 4,900,362, Canadian Patent No.
2,069,564, Japanese Patent Publication No. 61/004865 and
Japanese Patent Publication No. 3/031266.An objective of this invention is to define a
class of adhesion promoting compositions that will
cohesively bond organosiloxane compositions to organic
polymer substrates by a hydrosilation reaction to form an
elastomer while in contact with the organic polymer. It is 
another objective to do so without the presence of
potentially toxic bis-silylethylene groups.The present invention provides a liquid, adhesion-promoting
composition comprising (a) a copolymer derived
from at least one ethylenically unsaturated organic compound
and at least one silane containing an ethylenically
unsaturated organic group and at least two silicon-bonded
hydrolyzable groups per molecule, and (b) an
organohydrogensiloxane. If this composition is to be used
with organosiloxane elastomers that cure at temperatures
below 80°C. while in contact with the organic polymer
substrate, then our adhesion promoting composition also
includes an alkyl orthosilicate and an organotitanium
compound.These compositions are particularly suitable for
achieving bonding between organosiloxane elastomers that
cure by a hydrosilation reaction and the amorphous or
"glassy" types or organic polymers such as polymethyl
methacrylate and polycarbonates. A preferred application
for laminates
