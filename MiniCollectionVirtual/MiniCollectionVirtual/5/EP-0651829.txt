<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to spinnerets having orifices of unique cross-sections, the spinnerets being useful for extruding therethrough filaments having "U" and "E" shaped cross-sections with stabilizing legs. The use of strategically placed stabilizing legs allow the filaments to maintain the desired shape. The "U" shaped filament cross-section provides improved drainage over previous filament cross-sections.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to filaments having "U"
and "E" shaped cross-sections with stabilizing legs.
The use of strategically placed stabilizing legs allow
the filaments to maintain the desired shape. The "U"
shaped filament cross-section provides improved drainage
over previous filament cross-sections.Presently available absorbent articles such as
diapers, sanitary napkins, incontinence briefs, and the
like are generally very good at absorbing aqueous fluids
such as urine and blood. However, during typical use
such articles become saturated at the impingement zone
while other zones removed from the impingement zone will
remain dry. As a result, a substantial portion of the
total absorbent capabilities of such articles remains
unused. Thus, it is desirable to have a means for
transporting the aqueous fluids from the impingement
zone to other areas of the absorbent article to more
fully utilize the article's total absorbent capability.Filaments capable of spontaneously transporting
aqueous fluids such as water offer improved drainage
over other types of filaments such as those disclosed in
European Patent Application 0223908 and in U.S. Patent
No. 4,443,492. European Patent Application 0223908
discloses thermally bonded webs composed of polyester,
polypropylene, or polyethylene hydrophobic fibers which
are coated with acrylic acid partially neutralized by
alkali metallic salts and crosslinked simultaneously
with polymerization to form webs coated in situ with
superabsorbant polymer. The webs have increased 
absorption of fluid when used in a sanitary product such
as a diaper, but the individual fibers of the web do not
possess the ability to transport fluid from the crotch
area to lesser utilized areas of the absorbent core.U.S. Patent No. 4,443,492 describes the coating of
cellulose fiber based material with a water soluble
monomer which is converted into a water-absorptive
polymer. This type of material has poor absorption
performance because the monomer is able to penetrate
inside the fiber base material and fill the capillaries
between filaments. The mode of wicking in this prior
art is totally in the capillaries between the fibers.
The diameter of the capillaries is reduced by the
coating. As the coating swells in the wet state the
capillaries are blocked off.The present inventors have discovered that certain
filaments having "U" and "E" shaped cross-sections with
stabilizing legs more efficiently transport and drain
aqueous fluids than filaments capable of spontaneously
transporting fluids
