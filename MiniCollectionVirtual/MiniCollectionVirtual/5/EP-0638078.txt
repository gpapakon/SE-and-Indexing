<DESCRIPTION>
The avermectins (previously referred to as
C-076 compounds) are a series of compounds produced
by fermentation of avermectin producing strains of
Streptomyces avermitilis and derivatives thereof.
The morphological characteristics of the culture are
completely described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,310,519. The
production, isolation, and structure determination of
the avermectins are fully described in Albers-Schonberg
et al., J.Am.Chem.Soc.1981, 103,
4216-4221 and references cited therein. The
conversion of natural avermectin B1 to 22,23-dihydroavermectin
B1, the potent broad spectrum anthelminthic 
agent known as ivermectin, has also been described in
the literature (Chabala et al., J.Med.Chem.1980,
23, 1134-1136). The naturally occurring avermectins
and the instant derivatives thereof have a very high
degree of anthelminthic and anti-parasitic activity.The naturally occurring avermectins are a
series of macrocyclic lactones which are substituted
at position 13 with a disaccharide consisting of two
oleandrose residues. The preparation and properties
of synthetic avermectin aglycones in which the
disaccharide moiety has been removed leaving a free
hydroxyl group at position 13 have been described by
Mrozik et al., J.Org.Chem.1982,47, 489-492 and by
Chabala et al., J.Med.Chem.1980,23, 1134-1136.
The natural compounds have the following general
structure:
 
wherein the broken line at the 22,23-position
indicates a single or double bond and;
R1 ishydroxy and is present only when said broken
line indicates a single bond;R2 isisopropyl or sec-butyl; andR3 ismethoxy or hydroxy.There are eight major natural avermectin
compounds, designated A1a, A1b, A2a, A2b, B1a, B1b,
B2a and B2b. These designations are based on the
structure of the individual compounds as shown in the
following table (referring to the foregoing
structural formula).

mixtures of the a and b components (typically ≥80% a
and ≤20% b). Such compounds differ only in the
nature of the R2 substituent and this minor
structural difference has been found to have very
little effect on the chemical reactivity or
biological activity of the compounds. Thus although 
the a and b components can be separated from each
other by chromatography this is not necessary and
