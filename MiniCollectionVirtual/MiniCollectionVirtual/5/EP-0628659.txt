<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method for keeping the 
coating-bar cradle in a bar coater clean in a bar 

coater in which the coating bar is substantially over 
its entire length supported revolvingly in a bar 

cradle (18) fixed to the frame of the coater, which 
cradle is provided with one or several water grooves 

(5) substantially parallel to the coating bar and open 
towards said coating bar. According to the invention, 

at least one of the water grooves (5) in the bar 
cradle (18) is kept open constantly and forcibly by 

promoting the flow in the water groove (5) by 
means of negative pressure connected to the outlet 

side of the water. The invention also concerns an 
equipment by whose means the cradle of the coating 

bar is kept clean constantly.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a method for keeping the coating-bar cradle in a bar coater 
clean in a bar coater in which the coating bar is substantially over its entire length 
supported revolvingly in a bar cradle fixed to the frame of the coater, which cradle 
is provided with one or several water grooves substantially parallel to the coating bar 
and open towards said coating bar. The invention also concerns a bar coater in which the coating bar is substantially over its entire 
length supported revolvingly in a cradle fixed to the frame of the coater, which 
cradle is provided with at least one water groove substantially parallel to the coating 
bar and open towards said coating bar. Bar coaters are used in the coating of paper in particular in cases in which it is 
feared that the coating blade in a blade coater produces streaks in the paper face. At 
present, especially in size presses, bar coaters have proved very good and usable, 
because by their means the size film can be metered well onto the roll faces in the 
size press. The coating bars in bar coaters may be either grooved or smooth-faced. 
A coating bar is, as a rule, rotated in the sense opposite to the running direction of 
the web, the object of said rotation being complete elimination of said streaks occasionally 
associated with the use of blade coaters. The speed of rotation of the bar is, 
as a rule, 10...600 revolutions per minute. This is why the coating bars are provided 
with a suitable drive gear to rotate the bar, and in wide machines the bars are 
usually provided with drives at both ends of the bar so as to avoid torsional oscillations. 
When a bar coater is used, the coating process itself can be arranged, for 
example, so that the coating agent is applied to the web face by means of an 
applicator roll, and any excessive coating agent is doctored off the web face by  
 
means of the coating bar. A bar coater may also be constructed as a so-called short-dwell 
unit, in which the coating agent is introduced into a coating-agent chamber, 
which is defined by the front wall of the chamber and, on the other hand, by the 
coating bar and by the base to be coated itself, which base may be the face of a size-press 
roll, the face of a back-up roll, the paper web, or equivalent. As a rule, the coating bar is mounted as revolving in a cradle made of a suitable 
material, for example polyurethane. The bar is normally supported in said cradle 
over its entire length. In the cradle, in connection with the bar, as a rule, a water 
groove or

<CLAIMS>
Method for keeping the coating-bar cradle in a bar coater (10) clean, 
in which the coating bar (13) is substantially over its entire length supported 

revolvingly in a bar cradle (18,18a) fixed to the frame of the coater (10), which 
cradle is provided with one or several water grooves (5,5a) substantially parallel to 

the coating bar (13) and open towards said coating bar, 
characterized
 in 
that at least one of the water grooves (5,5a) in the bar cradle (18,18a) is kept open 

constantly and forcibly by promoting the flow in the water groove (5,5a) by means 
of negative pressure connected to the outlet side of the water groove. 
Method as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized
 in that water is fed into 
the water groove (5,5a) from one or several points in the longitudinal direction of 

the bar cradle (18,18a), and correspondingly water is removed out of the water 
groove (5,5a) by means of negative pressure from one or several points in the 

longitudinal direction of the bar cradle (18,18a). 
Method as claimed in claim 2, 
characterized
 in that the water groove 
(5a) is divided by means of partition walls (31) or equivalent into separate zones in 

the longitudinal direction of the bar cradle (18a), water being fed into said zones and 
water being removed from said zones through separate feed and outlet ducts (26,27, 

29,30), in which case the flow in each zone is free from any disturbance that might 
possibly be caused by the flows taking place through the other zones. 
Method as claimed in any of the preceding claims, 
characterized
 in 
that the negative pressure in the water groove (5,5a) is produced by means of one or 

several vacuum pumps (24) connected with the duct/ducts (23,29,30) at the outlet 
side. 
A bar coater 
(10) in which the coating bar (13) is substantially over its entire length supported  

 
revolvingly in a cradle (18,18a) fixed to the frame of the coater (10), which cradle 

is provided with at least one water groove (5,5a,6) substantially parallel to the 
coating bar (13) and open towards said coating bar (13), 
characterized
 in 
that a vacuum pump (24) is connected to the water groove (5,5a) to the side of the 

outlet flow of water, which pump is fitted to produce negative pressure in the water 
gr
oove (5,5a) so as to promote the water flow and to prevent leakage of water out 
of the water groove (5,5a). 
A bar coater as claimed in claim 5, 
characterized
 in that the supply of 
water into the water groove (5,5a) is arranged from one or several points in the 

longitudinal direction of the bar cradle (18,18a), and correspondingly the removal of 
water from the water groove (5,5a) is arranged from one or several points in the 

longitudinal direction of the bar cradle (18,18a), each outlet duct (29,30) communicating 
with a source (24) of negative pressure. 
A bar coater as claimed in claim 6, 
characterized
 in that the water 
groove (5a) is divided by partition walls (31) into two or more zones, each of said 

zones being provided with supply of water and with removal of water taking place 
by means of negative pressure.
