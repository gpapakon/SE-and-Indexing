<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a curved conveyor with an endless belt, two rollers serving for its deflection, a drive means, a guide device with castors running on it, and a frame, the drive means being a toothed belt (2) fastened to the inside of the endless belt (1), the rollers (5) each being provided with a toothed ring (4) which is in engagement with the toothed belt (2), the guide device being a profiled belt (3) extending at a constant distance from the toothed belt (2) and fixed to the endless belt (1), and the castors (9) being fastened to the frame (15) so as to be rotatable about an axis extending parallel to the perpendicular to the surface of the endless belt (1) and being subjected to a force directed radially outwards.

Cam conveyor having an endless belt, two pulleys used to deflect it, a 
toothed belt affixed to the inside of the endless belt as drive means, a guide 

device, which extends at a constant distance to the tooth belt, is affixed to the 
inside of the endless belt, and has rollers that run thereupon, and a mounting, 


wherein
 said pulleys (5) respectively are provided with a toothed ring (4), 
which engages with said toothed belt (2),
 
that said guide device is a profile belt (3) with which rollers (9) engage in a 

form-fit manner,
 
and that said rollers (9) are affixed to said mounting (15) so as to pivot about 

an axis that extends parallel of normal to surface of said endless belt (1), are 
impinged by a force that is directly radially outwards, and are movable radially. 
Cam conveyor according to claim 1, 
wherein
 there are rolling-bearing 
mounted rollers (9). 
Cam conveyor according to claim 1 or 2, 
wherein
 said pulleys (5) are 
divided axially into separately pivoted sections. 
Cam conveyor according to claim 3, 
wherein
 there are cylindrical pulleys 
(5).  

 
Cam conveyor according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
wherein
 said toothed belt 
(2) and/or profile belt (3) are glued and/or welded and/or sewn to said endless 

belt (1). 
Endless conveyor according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
wherein
 said toothed 
belt (2) is affixed proximate to the radially exterior edge of said endless belt (1). 
Endless conveyor according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
wherein
 said toothed 
belt (2) is free of reinforcing strengtheners. 
Endless conveyor according to one of claims 1 to 7, 
wherein
 the cross 
section of said profile belt (3) is T-shaped, U-shaped or angular and a form-fit 

connection is effected with said rollers (9) in a vertical direction. 
Endless conveyor according to one of claims 1 to 8, 
wherein
 there is a 
profile inserted in the radially inner flank of said toothed belt (2) as said profile 

belt (3).  
 
Cam conveyor according to one of claims 1 to 9, 
wherein
 said toothed belt 
(2) is driven by an endless double-toothed belt, whereby two toothed wheels 

(13), mounted at a distance to one another, with parallel axes, engage with the 
inner row of teeth
 of double-toothed belt (12), one of said toothed wheels (13) 
is connected to a drive, and the outer row of teeth of a strand of double-toothed 

belt (12) engages with toothed belt (2).
