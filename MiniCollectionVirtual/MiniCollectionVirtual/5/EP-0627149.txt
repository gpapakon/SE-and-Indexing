<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method by means of which a first node (X) in a first telecommunication network is able to establish cooperation with a functionality present in a second node (Y) in a second telecommunication network as a result of the second node (Y) initiating the establishment of a connection to the first node (X) by using a reference, called interaction number, as a destination address, this interaction number being associated with the cooperation desired between the nodes. The reference is chosen from among predetermined destination addresses in the first node (X).

Applicant's reference LM 5516;2) "A Method of Providing an Intelligent Network
Service", with Applicant's reference LM 5515;3) "A Method of Supporting Communication", with Applicant's
reference LM 5520;4) "A Paging Method", with Applicant's reference LM
5519; and5) "A Method of Organizing Communication", with Applicant's
reference LM 5517.These applications
describe mechanisms which can be used
in the method according to the present invention. By communication services is meant conventional tele-phony
services, telex services, datapack services, data
services, telefax services, videotext services, ISDN-services,
mobile telephony services, personal paging
services, tele-point-services and general communication
between two or more parties. The services recited above
are only examples of the services possible and are not
intended to limit the scope of the invention.By telecommunication network is normally meant the telephone
networks, telex networks, circuit connected data
networks, picture information transfer networks, private
telecommunication networks, radio networks, satellite
communication networks and general carriers of the communication
services, such as analog transmission, digital
transmission, synchronous, multiplex or asynchronous
multiplex transmission, ATM, etc., for example. These
networks are recited solely by way of example and the
invention is not restricted thereto.By functionality is meant the ability to perform an
operation in a telecommunication network. Examples of
functionality include activities and services that can be
performed in the telecommunication network. Examples of
functionalities include an enquiry to establish a connection
path or route between two parties, digit analysis,
billing or ticketing. Although not necessary, the functionality
may require the availability of dedicated
equipment for carrying out the functionality. For instance,
if the functionality is to receive tones and to

A method in accordance with claim 1, wherein a first
subscriber (A) wants to communicate with a second subscriber

(B), comprising the following steps:
