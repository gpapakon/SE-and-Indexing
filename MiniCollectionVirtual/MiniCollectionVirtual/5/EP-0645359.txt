<ABSTRACT>
A method for synthesizing alkyl tertiary-alkyl 
ether from tertiary alcohol and primary alcohol in the 

presence of a catalyst, characterized in that the 
catalyst is a chlorohydrol-treated, phosphated acidic 

montmorillonite clay. The process is suited to the 
production of MTBE.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the synthesis of alkyl t-alkyl
ether using pillared, phosphated montmorillonite
clay catalysts. In particular, this invention concerns
an improved process for preparing methyl tertiary-butyl
ether (MTBE) by the reaction of tertiary-butanol and
methanol in the presence of a catalyst comprising a
chlorohydrol-treated, phosphated montmorillonite clay
catalyst. According to the present invention, MTBE has
been generated in up to 40% concentration in the crude
product. This catalyst demonstrates improved yields of
MTBE product compared with unmodified montmorillonite
clay. Another desirable feature is that the product mix
separates into an isobutylene-MTBE product-rich phase
and a heavier aqueous methanol phase at operating
temperatures of 160°C or greater.It is well-known that there is pressure to
eliminate lead compounds from fuels for reasons of
public health and environmental protection. Although
the specifications for reformulated gasolines set by the
United States EPA will come into force in 1995,
standards were brought into force in November 1992
requiring gasoline to contain at least 2.7 wt% oxygen
during the winter in nonattainment areas of the U.S. If
the federal air quality standard for CO was not achieved
by a specified attainment date, the minimum oxygen
content would increase to 3.1%. Moreover, starting in
the summer of 1992, the maximum blending Reid vapor 
pressure (BRvp) of all gasolines was set at 0.06 MPa
(9.0 psi). Since oxygenates are not only used as
gasoline blending components, extenders, octane boosters
and as key ingredients for reducing the emissions of CO
and VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds), it is expected
that the demand for oxygenates will increase enormously
in the coming years. See F. Cunill, et al., "Effect of
Water Presence on Methyl tert-Butyl Ether and Ethyl
tert-Butyl Ether Liquid-Phase Synthesis". Ind. Eng.
Chem. Res. 1993, 32, 564-569.Of all oxygenates, the tertiary ethers, such as
methyl t-butyl ether (MTBE), ethyl tert-butyl ether
(ETBE), and tert-amyl methyl ether (TAME) are preferred
by refineries to lighter alcohols. They have lower
blending Reid vapor pressure (BRvp), lower vaporization
latent heats and low solubilities in water. The most
common ether in use today is MTBE with a production of
about 25 million metric tons. However, ETBE is becoming
more attractive as the price of methanol goes up in
relation to gasoline. It can be produced from renewable
ethanol, in contrast to methanol derived from natural
gas, and its use would help
