<ABSTRACT>
Previously known fire resistant materials are not suitable for use in dynamic (moving or subject to movement) structures. Flexible composite materials of the present invention are suitable for use as fire barriers for either static or dynamic joints and are cost effective and easy to install. In one preferred embodiment the flexible composite includes: (a) a first layer material having first and second major surfaces, the first layer material including inorganic fibers and a binder in the form of a flexible mat; (b) a second layer material adhered to the first major surface of the first layer material, the second layer material being metal foil, the metal foil having a melting temperature of at least 350  DEG C; and (c) a third layer adhered to the second major surface of the first layer material, the third layer material including an intumescent fire retardant composite material.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to flexible composite materials suitable for use in
deterring the spread of fire, smoke, and fumes as may happen in a fire in a
multi-floor building.Fire, smoke, and fumes in confined spaces, such as multi-floor buildings,
can be extremely life threatening. Frequently, if fire originates in the space
between a floor and ceiling of such a structure, the fire, and resultant smoke
and fumes, will tend to spread to other open spaces in the building, especially
to open spaces above the point of origin of the fire.The reasons behind this spread of fire, smoke, and fumes to higher areas
are varied. The areas between conduits, piping, and the like, and
floors/ceilings through which they pass, are known as "through-penetrations".
If not fire protected, through- penetrations offer areas of low resistance to fire,
smoke, and fumes, and in essence serve as "chimneys". These areas may be
filled with commercially available fire retardant and intumescent putties, caulks,
wraps, or mats, known in the art as "firestops". Representative firestop
products are disclosed in product brochure number 98-0701-3508-6 (published
1990) from Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company (3M). The 3M
products are currently known under the trade designations "CP 25WB", "CP 25N/S",
"CP 25S/L", and "Firedam" (caulks); "MPP-4S" and "MPS-2"
(moldable putties); "FS-195" and "CS-195" (moldable strips); and "Interam"
and "Interam E-5" (mats). These products are variously described in assignee's
U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,916,057; 4,273,879; 4,305,992; 4,364,210; 4,433,732; and
4,467,577.The above firestop products and others have been widely used for
reducing or eliminating the chimney effect for through-penetrations and pass the 
rigorous American Society of Testing Materials (ASTM) fire endurance test
(ASTM E-814) after intumescing and charring. However, even if the fire is
contained in the space between one floor and the next highest floor by a
firestop, serious hazards remain. This is because many multi-level buildings
will have joints between exterior walls and floors constructed as illustrated in
side elevation in FIG. 1. Shown is "vision" or "spandrel" (i.e., ornamental)
glass 10, which may form the exterior of a building. (Alternatively, 10 may be
concrete, marble, and the like.) Typically, an inorganic fibrous material 12 is
installed for thermal insulation (referred to in the art as a "curtain wall"). The
inorganic fibrous material may be glass fiber, mineral wool, and the like.
Thermal insulation 12 is fastened to a
