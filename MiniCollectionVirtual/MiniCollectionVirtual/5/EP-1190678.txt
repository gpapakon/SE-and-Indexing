<ABSTRACT>
An assembly such as an anchor screw, bone plate, offset hook, post, transverse
connector or other spinal anchor for anchoring to bone and clamping a linkage such as

a rod, wire cable or the like. The assembly has a top member (33,53,153) with an open slot (34) to
receive the linkage, and a twist-lock closure cap (40,60,140) to close the open end, capturing the

linkage in the slot. One closure cap fits over and around the top member, with a set of
segmented protrusions (46a,46b,46c,46d,146) that extend through a corresponding set of protruding flange

segments (36a,36b,36c,36d,158) spaced about the circumference of the top member. The cap is configured to
rotate and lock against the top member like a flange-locking bayonet mount when

turned through a limited degree of rotation. Slots (62a,62b) may be provided through the face of
the closure cap allowing reduction tabs (55) to project through the cap, and the locking cap

may be adapted to a range of screw, eye, hook, post, connector and other anchor
assemblies to securely clamp the linkage by use of a rotation tool disposed along an

access path aligned with the axis of the screw, thus requiring no lateral clearance along
the longitudinal direction of the linkage element. Locking is effected by a set screw

that passes (42) through the cap and tightens against the linkage to firmly immobilize it in
the anchor assembly.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to orthopedic fastening systems and to mechanisms for securing and locking a linking or stabilizing element, such as a rod, to a bone screw having a slotted head that receives the rod therein. It also relates to structures or anchor assemblies having such a slotted or open head for receiving a rod, wherein the slotted portion extends from a hook, plate, bracket or positioning arm.A number of such structures are known. Thus, for example, the widely used Harms T-plate used for stabilizing the cervical vertebrae has a projecting slotted bolt adapted to receive a rod or cable through the slot and clamp down by screwing a nut along the bolt to bear down against the rod. Several patents show holding structures for a fixation rod that are incorporated in the head of a screw, as in U.S. Patent 5,672,176, or into a small offset plate which itself may be fastened to the bone, as shown in published International Application WO96/28105. Other systems involve hooks, transverse rod connectors, or tandem connectors. Various tools have been provided for these systems to enable the surgeon to bend and shape the rod to a desired contour in situ, to position the rod in the slot of a bolt or head, and to secure the rod in position.Because the rod is the stabilizing member which provides a precise contour, spacing or connection between one or more vertebrae, bones or bone fragments, alignment is quite critical, and the ability to pass the rod through two or more connecting assemblies requires various actions to form and shape the rod, or align the receiving structures at defined positions or path before final clamping is effected. This may involve positioning and removing the rod several times to check and adjust the degree of alignment. Thus, it is generally desirable to have a closure or secure locking mechanism that may be effected with simple installation steps.One generally accepted locking mechanism simply involves an internally threaded locking nut that may be tightened down along the axis of the screw or slotted shaft, using a tool such as a socket wrench. Another commercial device employs a bayonet-mount cap that captures or is captured by the screw head, as in United States Patents 5,346,493 and 5,257,993 or DE-U-9403231. Another system utilizes a cap element with a dovetail or dovetail channel that slides over the rod to close the top of the slot and wedge the rod firmly in position. This latter construction involves no rotation of threaded members, but has the disadvantage that a

An anchor assembly for securing a linking element, wherein the anchor assembly comprises:

an anchor element (31; 50; 100) configured for attachment to a bone, and having a head (33; 53; 153) having an open slot (34) for receiving the linking element, the head including at least two side walls defining at least a portion of the open slot (34) with inferior contact surfaces (38; 159) defined in the side walls; and
a cap (40; 60; 140) having a plurality of radially protruding cap flange segments (46; 46) for closing the open slot; and
wherein the head (33; 53; 153) and the cap (40; 60; 140) are adapted to capture the linking element by a partial rotation of the cap, and the cap further includes a central clamping member for tightening down to secure the linking element;
characterised in that
 a plurality of radially protruding head flange segments (36; 158) having said inferior contact surfaces (38; 159) are provided on each side wall, the head flange segments (36; 158) and the cap flange segments (46; 146) corresponding to each other and being relatively moveable by said partial rotation from being rotationally offset from each other to being locked against each other whereby said inferior contact surfaces (38; 159) are engaged with said cap flange segments (46; 146).
The assembly of claim 1, wherein the head (53) includes a pair of reduction tabs (55) extending upwardly therefrom, and said cap (60) includes a corresponding pair of circumferentially oriented slots (62) configured for passage of the reduction tabs therethrough so as to allow relative rotation of the head and the cap.
The assembly of claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the clamping member includes a clamping screw that passes centrally through the cap (40; 60; 140) for locking the linking element in position.
The assembly of any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein the head flange segments (36) extend externally of the perimeter of the head (33; 53), and said cap flange segments (46) project inwardly from a dependent circumferential body (43).
The assembly of any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein the head flange segments (158) extend internally of the perimeter of the head (153), and said cap (140) fits within the head.
