<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for optimizing positional data for use in connection with a hard disk type magnetic memory storage device. The apparatus includes a pattern encoded on a dedicated track (58) of the hard disk including first (44) and second set (46) of signals repetitively encoded in a series of cells (50). The method includes the steps of periodically accessing the dedicated track with the read/write head and calculating amplitude and phase information for a trigonometric instantaneous correction function. Amplitude and phase information are subsequently stored and the positional signal for the read/write head is continually modified by a most recent determination of the correction function. The apparatus of the present invention includes circuitry for distinguishing between sub-elements of the repetitive pattern on the hard disk.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to 
computer data storage systems and, more particularly, to correction of data track 
positional signals in a hard disk drive type data storage systems. Hard disk type magnetic memories have become one of the more commonly 
used systems for the storage of large quantities of data in computers. Up to 1.6 
gigabits of data have been stored on a single disk about 6 inches in diameter. Hard 
disk memories usually include a rigid disk having a magnetic recording material 
applied to either or both of the flat surfaces of the disk. Small read/write heads 
are disposed adjacent these coated surfaces to access data on the disk. Typically, 
the read/write heads can either impress a magnetic field onto a segment of the disk 
as data is "written" onto the disk or sense the polarization of an existing magnetic 
field on the disk as data is "read" from the disk. A generally conventional hard disk 
type data storage system is illustrated in FIG. 1. The hard disk system 10 includes 
a plurality of rigid disks 12 attached at their centers to a spindle 15 with a series of 
read/write heads 18 flexibly coupled to a servo system 20 disposed adjacent the 
hard disks 12. Usually one read/write head 18 is associated with each flat surface 
12a of the hard disks. In operation the disks 12 commonly rotate at speeds of 
several thousand revolutions per minute with the read/write heads 18 floating 
above the surfaces of the disks on a boundary layer of air about a millionth of an 
inch (25 nm) thick. Pivotal motion of the servo system 20 alters the position of the 
read/write heads 18 relative to the center of the disks 12, affording the read/write 
heads 18 coverage of the flat surfaces of the spinning disks 12.  
 The data recording surfaces of the hard disk are normally divided into 
numerous circular regions called tracks which are in turn subdivided into sectors. 
A sector normally takes up a predetermined portion of the arc of a single circular 
track. Typically, one surface on one of the hard disks 12 has a pre-recorded pattern 
dedicated to providing positional information for the heads 18. This dedicated hard 
disk surface is commonly referred to as the servo surface. Since the heads 18 move 
in unison, the positional information stored on the dedicated servo surface may be 
used to position any of the heads 18 with respect to any desired data track on their 
associated hard disk data surface. As data storage densities on hard disks continues 
to increase, however, the width of
