<DESCRIPTION>
The apparatus of this invention is primarily
designed for use by the nuclear industry for
decontamination of radioactive contaminated surfaces. The
apparatus consists of a number of operational stages, one
of which provides a continuous decontaminating liquid flow
ranging from ambient temperatures up to 260Â°C (+500 degree F).
Suitable flow, temperature and pressure valves and gauges
are provided for permitting the operator to select the
optimum parameters for the clean up being performed.Included in the operational stages is a single
vacuum power unit for creating an operational controlled
recovery vacuum flow throughout the entire apparatus.
Further stages of the recovery and discharge system
including a critical mass collector and separator,
demister, filters and absorbers, all having the
construction and configuration necessary for performing the
specific cleaning application as required.Simultaneously with the remote cleaning activity the
recovery vacuum flow induced throughout the operational
stages will pick up the liquid laden contamination removed
from the surface being cleaned and transfer it to the
collector and filtering units that in turn separates the
air and liquid mixture with each being separately filtered
and contained for disposal. Past devices of a similar type to that described in
this application have included a pressurized heat cleaning
liquid and dispensing means associated with a vacuum
recovery system such as is described and shown in United
States Patent 2,908,030, and EP-A-0 135 978.While these prior devices also include operational
controls, such controls are activated by the inherent
functioning of the associated parts, such as a pressure
relief valve controlling the heating and pressurizing of
the cleaning liquid.The object of the present invention is to provide
operational controls which are individually and
collectively associated with each segment of the system
and which are responsive to the results achieved thereby.Considering the decontaminating of radioactive
material, the controls for the accumulation of a critical
mass, which is the product of the operation of the system,
is the principal object of this invention. Thus the
collector of the decontaminated material is provided with a
operational control responsive to a critical mass volume.
The filter and demisting of the collected contaminated
material is provided with a operational control responsive
to a critical mass volume. Each of these controls,
activated by the results of the operation of the system,
will
