<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to Pd/K/Au, Pd/K/Ba and Pd/K/Cd supported catalysts constructed in a shell-shape, their production and their use for the preparation of vinyl acetate from ethylene, acetic acid and oxygen in the gas phase. The said catalysts are produced by impregnating the support particles, intimately mixing them with a solution of salts of the corresponding elements and then immediately drying them, the dynamic viscosity of the solution being at least 0.003 Pa.s and the solution volume during impregnation being 5 to 80% of the pore volume of the support particles.
