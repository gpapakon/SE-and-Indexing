<ABSTRACT>
Curtain for optionally covering a surface area having essentially three or more sides, in particular for shading a window area, in particular a folded curtain with pleated drape material, having (at least) one non-rectangular (first) drape (1, 5) which is fastened, on two mutually opposite borders of different lengths, in each case on a rail of a pair of two mutually parallel rails (2, 3; 2, 4), of which the shorter rail (2) can be moved transversely with respect to its longitudinal direction, in the plane of the drape, the drape material having at least one tensioning means (11), acted upon by a tensioning force, in the manner of a tensioning wire, a tensioning cord or the like running through it, said tensioning means extending through holes in the drape material, having an oblique portion (11'') which runs essentially parallel to a border (1a) which runs at an acute angle to the rails (2 to 4) and belongs to the (first) drape section (1), and is fastened, at its two ends (e.g. 11'''), in each case in the region of a rail (3 or 7), the tensioning means (11) being fastened, at its upper end portion (11'), in the region of its oblique portion (11'') and, at its other end (11'''), on a fixed rail (3) arranged beneath the (first) drape (1).

covering (1), being movable transversely to its
longitudinal direction in the covering plane, at least

one tensioning means (11) in the form of a wire or cord
extending through the covering material and being

subjected to a tensioning force by a tensioning-force
generator (12), wherein a sloping portion (11") of the

tensioning means (11), which runs substantially
parallel to an edge (1a) of the covering (1) at an

acute angle to the rails (2 to 4) extends through holes
in the covering material and the top end (11') of the

tensioning means is fastened in the region of a
stationary top rail (6, 7) and the bottom end (11"')

end portion (11') of the tensioning means (11) is so

deflected at one end in the stop rail (6) and at the
other end in the neighbouring movable top rail (2) that

the sloping portion (11") of the tensioning means (11)
adjoins at the bottom the place where the tensioning

means (11) is deflected at the movable top rail (2).

claims, characterised in that an additional movable 

rail (4) is disposed underneath the stationary rail
(3), and a second covering (5) is held between the

downwards at right angles to the bottom rail (3) at the

said movable intermediate rail (4') and is fastened
below the movable top rail (4').
