<ABSTRACT>
An electrosurgical control (10) for a trocar (11) has a trocar (11) with a cannula (12) with a stylet (13) coaxially fit therein. The stylet (13) is movable relative to the cannula (12) along a common axis. The trocar (11) is shaped for insertion in a direction generally along the axis through tissue in a puncture procedure with its stylet (13). A distal end (15) and a proximal end (16) on the elongate cannula (12) so the distal end (15) enters the tissue while the proximal end (16) remains outside. A tip (17) on the stylet (13) end, near the distal end (15) of the cannula (12), normally extends therebeyond in position to puncture the tissue. The stylet (13) has an energy supply (18) passing from the tip (17) to its opposite end (19) and moves reciprocally relative to the cannula (12) so the tip (17) extends or is fully within the cannula (12). An electrosurgical generator (20) provides energy to the opposite end (19) of the stylet (13) and an electrosurgically active device is a part of the tip (17) and connects to the energy supply (18). A sampling circuit (21) is connected to the electrosurgically active device and responds to changes in energy passing through the energy supply (18) as a function of tissue cut by the electrosurgically active device. The sampling circuit (21) provides a signal relative to the energy supplied and a measuring circuit (22) analyzes the signal to instantly isolate a specific signal therefrom indicative of a significant change in the energy when the tip (17) is not in tissue. A comparator (23) has a settable predetermined threshold amount of energy at which the electrosurgical generator (20) no longer supplies energy. A peak energy level is set by a knob (24) and is compared to the varying signals from the sampling circuit (21). A switch (25) responds to the comparator (23) to disconnect the energy when the threshold is exceeded.

 ELECTROSURGICAL CONTROL FOR A TROCAR1. Field of the InventionAn electrosurgical generator control responsive to energy required to cut tissue of a human or animal, and more specifically the energy flowing through a distal tip of a cutting instrument applied directly to the tissue.2. Background of the DisclosureSurgery through a trocar inserted cannula and particularly with an opening through the tissue of an animal or human abdominal wall has become an important means to minimize the extent of surgical invasion. The lessening of invasion improves the cosmetic result, shortens recovery and lowers the cost. Endoscopic internal surgical procedures and equipment are available and in use for a variety of medical operations including gall bladder, bowel and gynecological surgery. A proper and simple instrument to open the passage through the abdominal wall and avoid injury to internal organs during the placement of the cannula by means of a trocar is needed.U. S. Patent No. 3,595,239 discloses a catheter tube having an obturator in the form of an electrode passing coaxially therethrough. The obturator electrode is connected to an electrosurgical generator in order to provide high frequency energy used to divide or cut tissue thereby forming a passage for the catheter to pass through. The tip of the obturator extends beyond the catheter tip and is capable of cutting. The catheter is moved along with the obturator electrode by means of a ring disposed about the obturator proximal to the tip and inside the tip of the catheter. There is no disclosure of any means for sensing the impedance or load associated with the energy required to do the cutting during insertion of the obturator tip.U. S. Patent No. 4,856,530 discloses an automatic system for determination of the size of a catheter distal tip remotely at the proximal end of the catheter. A capacitor at the distal tip is connected to a pair of wires which extends proximally to a microprocessor which determines the decay constant of the capacitor 

 and thereby establishes the catheter size. There is no disclosure of interactive measurement of the energy required for cutting tissue by impedance load or otherwise.U. S. Patent 4,651 ,280 discloses a microprocessor with a preset control for an electrosurgical unit during a transurethral resection. A current monitoring probe about the output of the electrosurgical unit is responsive to load such that differences in the tissue and in inclusions therein are measured as changes in conductivity which are directly
