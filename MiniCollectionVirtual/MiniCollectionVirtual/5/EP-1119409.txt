<ABSTRACT>
Single site nitrogen and oxygen and metallacyclic catalysts comprising at least two polymerization-stable anionic ancillary ligands and a Group 3-10 metal are disclosed wherein the nitrogen or oxygen heterocyclic catalyst is produced by dimerizing an alkylamido or trimerizing a metal containing oxane. The polymerization-stable anionic ancillary ligands are preferably either cyclopentadienyl, borataaryl, pyrrolyl, azaboralinyl, pyridinyl, or a quinolinyl ring. In a preferred embodiment, the invention relates to catalysts of the formula (I) or (II) wherein M is a transition metal of Groups 3-10; L is a polymerization-stable anionic ancillary ligand; R is a hydrocarbyl group containing up to about 12 carbon atoms optionally substituted with halogen; and E is R or halogen, alkoxy from C1 to C20, siloxy from C1 to C20, N(R)2, hydrogen or another univalent anionic ligand, or mixtures thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
 APPLICATION FOR PATENTTITLE: CYCLIC OLIGOMERIC OXO- AND IMIDO- METALCOMPLEXES AS OLEFIN POLYMERIZATION CATALYSTSINVENTORS: Bradley P. Etherton, Ramesh Krishnamurti, Sandor NagyField of the InventionThis invention relates to a novel metallocene catalyst system containing a metallacyclic catalyst having at least two polymerization-stable anionic ancillary ligands. The invention further relates to a method of preparation of the catalyst and a method of using the same. Background of the InventionHistorically, polyolefms have been made with conventional Ziegler catalyst systems.Such catalysts typically consist of transition metal-containing compounds and one or more organometallic compounds. For example, polyethylene has been made using such Ziegler catalysts as titanium trichloride and diethylaluminum chloride, as well as a mixture of titanium tetrachloride, vanadium oxytrichloride, and triethylaluminum.While these catalysts are inexpensive, they exhibit low activity and therefore must be used at high concentrations. As a result, it is sometimes necessary to remove catalyst residues from the polymer, which adds to production costs. Neutralizing agents and stabilizers must be added to the polymer to overcome the deleterious effects of the catalyst residues. Failure to remove catalyst residues leads to polymers having a yellow or grey color and poor ultraviolet and long term stability. Additionally, for example, chloride-containing residues can cause corrosion in polymer processing equipment.Furthermore, Ziegler catalysts produce polymers having a broad molecular weight distribution which is undesirable for some applications such as injection molding. They are also poor at incorporating α-olefm co-monomers. Poor co-monomer incorporation makes it difficult to control the polymer density. Large quantities of excess co-monomer may be required to achieve a certain density and many higher α-olefms, such as 1-octene, may be incorporated at only very low levels, if at all.Although significant improvements in Ziegler catalyst systems have occurred since their initial discovery, they lately have been substantially replaced with "single-site," in particular, 

metallocene, catalyst systems. A traditional metallocene catalyst typically consists of a transition metal compound which has one or more cyclopentadienyl ring ligands bound in an η5 fashion. The cyclopentadienyl ring ligands are polymerization-stable; that is, they remain bound to the metal during the course of the polymerization process. They produce polymers
