<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a surgical appliance for placing probes (3) or catheters having resilient retention plates (2) for the surgical or therapeutic treatment of the human or animal body by means of a puncturing cannula (1) and a puncturing needle (5) displaceably received in a passage (4) in the puncturing cannula (1). In order to essentially simplify placing of the probe, the puncturing cannula (1) is designed for direct insertion of the probe (3) and has at least one continuous slot (9) in the region of its shaft, the segment-shaped tongues (10) formed by the slot (9) being held together by guides formed on the circumference of the puncturing needle (5). A sleeve-shaped piece (15) can be inserted in the puncturing cannula (1), and the probe (3) with the retention plate (2) can be inserted therein via a slide-in aid (8). The slide-in aid (8) is of tubular design and has a passage for the tubing (7) of the probe.

<CLAIMS>
Application instruments set with a hose-shaped or tubular instrument (3) with an
instrument hose, such as probes, catheters or the like for the surgical or therapeutic

treatment of the human or animal body or for application in the diagnostic process,
wherein the application instruments set comprises an aspiration cannula (1) with a bushing

(4) with at least one longitudinal slot (9), characterised thereby, that the application
instruments set comprises an aspiration needle (5) received in the aspiration cannula (1)

to be displaceable and that the instrument (3) comprises an elastic retaining plate (2),
wherein the instrument (3) after removal of the aspiration needle (5) with its retaining plate

(2) is pushable forward through the aspiration cannula (1), whilst radially enlarging its
longitudinal bushing (4), by means of a pushing aid (8) displaying a passage (6) for the

instrument hose (7) and is thus introducible into the body.
Application instruments set according to claim 1, characterised thereby, that the
aspiration cannula (1) in the region of its shank (4) displays preferably four longitudinal

slots with frangible places which are arranged at the forward end of the aspiration cannula
(1) and which during the pushing-through of the pushing aid (8) with retaining plate (2)

break open whilst splaying out the segment-shaped tongues formed by the longitudinal
slots.
Application instruments set according to claim 1, characterised thereby, that the
aspiration cannula (1) in the region of its shank (4) displays preferably four longitudinal

slots (9), wherein segment-shaped tongues (10) formed by the longitudinal slots (9) are
held together by means of guides (11) formed circumferentially of the aspiration needle (5)

and are splayable open during the introduction of the pushing aid (8) with retaining plate
(2).
Application instruments set according to claim 3, characterised thereby, that the
guides at the aspiration needle (5) are formed as guide webs (11), which extend in

longitudinal direction of the aspiration needle (5), protrude radially outwards and which
together with the tongues (10) coming to lie therebetween make up a substantially closed

cylindrical outer casing surface. 
Application instruments set according to claim 3 or 4, characterised thereby, that
the guide webs (11) are formed to be substantially T-shaped and engageable behind by

the tongues (10) by side rims (12) set back in about step shape.
Application instruments set according to one of the claims 1 to 5, characterised
thereby, that the aspiration cannula (1) comprises an entry funnel (13) at its rear end.
Application instruments set according to one of the claims 2 to 5, characterised
thereby, that the longitudinal slots (9) of the aspiration cannula (1) extend beyond the entry

funnel (13) to an abutment plate (14) arranged at the rear end of the aspiration cannula
(1).
Application instruments set according to one of the claims 1 to 7, characterised
thereby, that the pushing aid (8) is formed as tubular member.
Application instruments set according to one of the claims 1 to 8, characterised
thereby, that a sleeve member (15), into which the pushing aid (8) with retaining plate (2)

of the instrument (3) is introducible, with an external diameter substantially corresponding
with the entry diameter of the entry funnel (13), is pushable into the aspiration cannula (1).
Application instruments set according to claim 9, characterised thereby, that for the
introduction of the sleeve member (15), the aspiration cannula (1) is provided with an entry

aid (16), which is pushable into the sleeve member (15) and in the pushed-in setting
displays a frusto-conical tip (17), which protrudes from the forward sleeve end and is

preferably rounded off.
Application instruments set according to claim 9 or 10, characterised thereby, that
the sleeve member (15) at its rear end displays an abutment plate (18), which faces

radially outwards and against which the entry aid (16) in the pushed-in setting in the sleeve
member (15) lies by its handle part (19).
Application instruments set according to one of the preceding claims, characterised
thereby, that the aspiration cannula (1), the sleeve member (15), the entry aid (16) and/or

the pushing aid (8) consist of synthetic material. 
Application instruments set according to one of the preceding claims, characterised
thereby, that the aspiration needle (5) is retained at a synthetic material part, which

comprises the guides (11) for the tongues (10) of the aspiration cannula (1), with a handle
member (20) arranged at the rear end.
