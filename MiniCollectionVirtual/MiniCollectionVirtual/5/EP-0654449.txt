<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with a method for controlling silica and silicate fouling
problems in aqueous systems. More particularly the invention is concerned with the use of
certain low molecular weight water-soluble (meth)acrylic or maleic acid based polymers to
inhibit deposition of magnesium silicate and other silicate and silica scales on surfaces.Silica is one of the major fouling problems in many processes using water. Silica is
difficult to deal with because it can assume many low solubility chemical forms depending
on the conditions. Below about pH 7 for example, monomeric silica tends to polymerize to
form oligomeric or colloidal silica. At higher pH's particularly above about pH 9.5, silica
can form monomeric silicate ion. Since conversion can be slow, all of these forms may
exist at any one time depending on the history of the system. Furthermore, the silicate ion
can react with polyvalent cations like magnesium and calcium commonly present in
process waters to produce salts with very limited solubility. Thus it is common for a
mixture of many forms to be present: monomeric, oligomeric and colloidal silica;
magnesium silicate, calcium silicate and other silicate salts. In describing this complex
system, it is common practice to refer to the mixture merely as silica or as silica and silicate.
Herein these terms are used interchangeably.A further complication in controlling silica and silicate fouling is that colloidal silica
tends to be more soluble as temperature is raised, while polyvalent metal salts of the silicate
ion tends to be less soluble with increasing temperature.Two possible mechanisms for controlling silica or silicate salts from fouling or
depositing on a surface during a process are : 1) inhibiting precipitation of the material from
the process water , and 2) dispersing the material once it has formed in the bulk water to
prevent it from attaching to surfaces. The exact mechanism by which a specific scale
inhibitor functions, however, is not well understood. The additives of this invention may
be operating by either or both of these routes.Processes that would likely benefit from a material that could inhibit the deposition
of silica or silicate salts from water are, for example: cooling water, boiler water, geothermal
process to generate electricity or for heating, and sugar (particularly cane and beet)
processing. In each of these processes, heat is transferred to or from the water. In three of
these processes, cooling water, boiler water and sugar processing, heat is added
