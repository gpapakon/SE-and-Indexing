<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a newly identified family of protein serine/threonine kinases which phosphorylate microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2). It is based, in part, on the cloning and characterization of novel MAP2 kinases designated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1, 2, and 3 (ERK1, ERK2, ERK3) which are expressed in the central nervous system, and on the identification of another ERK family member, ERK4, with antisera. The present invention provides fore recombinant nucleic acid molecules and proteins representing members of the MAP2 kinase family, and also for microorganisms, transgenic animals, and cell lines comprising recombinant MAP2 kinase molecules. In additional embodiments of the invention, the present invention provides for methods for assaying cellular factor activity, including, but not limited to, nerve growth factor activity, in which the activation of MAP2 kinase serves as an indicator of cellular factor activity. These methods may be extremely useful in screening compounds for the presence of a desired cellular factor activity. In specific embodiments, compounds which may be useful in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease , peripheral neuropathies, and diabetes may be identified using the methods of the invention.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a newly identified
family of MAP2 protein kinases. It is based, in part, on
the cloning and characterization of three MAP2 protein
kinases, designated ERK1, ERK2, and ERK3, which are
expressed in the central nervous system and elsewhere.A cascade of phosphorylation reactions, initiated by a
receptor tyrosine kinase, has been proposed as a potential
transducing mechanism for growth factor receptors,
including the insulin receptor (Cobb and Rosen, 1984,
Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 738:1-8; Denton et al., 1984,
Biochem. Soc. Trans. 12:768-771). In his review of the
role of protein phosphorylation in the normal control of
enzyme activity, Cohen (1985, Eur. J. Biochem. 151:439-448)
states that amplification and diversity in hormone action
are achieved by two principal mechanisms, the reversible
phosphorylation of proteins and the formation of "second
messengers"; many key regulatory proteins are
interconverted between phosphorylated and unphosphorylated
forms by cellular protein kinases and certain protein
phosphatases.Some hormones appear to transmit their information to
the cell interior by activating transmembrane signalling
systems that control production of a relatively small 
number of chemical mediators, the "second messengers."
These second messengers, in turn, are found to regulate
protein kinase and phosphatase activities, thereby altering
the phosphorylation states of many intracellular proteins,
and consequently controlling the activity of enzymes which
are regulated by their degree of phosphorylation (see
Figure 1). The receptors for other hormones are themselves
protein kinases or interact directly with protein kinases
to initiate protein kinase signalling cascades. These
series of events are believed to explain the diversity
associated with the actions of various hormones (Cohen,
1985, Eur. J. Biochem. 151:439-448; Edelman et al., 1987,
Ann. Rev. Biochem. 56:567-613).Insulin, like most cellular regulators, exerts its
effects on many cellular processes through alterations in
the phosphorylation state of serine and threonine residues
within regulated proteins. Insulin exerts these effects
via its receptor, which has intrinsic tyrosine-specific
protein kinase activity (Rosen et al., 1983, Proc. Natl.
Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 80:3237-3240; Ebina et al., 1985, Cell
40:747-758). Of note, the proteins encoded by several
oncogenes are also protein-tyrosine kinases. For example,
P68gag-ros, a transmembrane transforming protein, bears
many similarities to the insulin receptor,
