<ABSTRACT>
A method for processing heavy petroleum crude provides for preliminary modification of a part of the initial raw material 
and/or heavy petroleum crude which is different by its content from the initial raw material to be processed. For that purpose 

it is subjected to processing by air at a temperature of 200-300 °C at a mass ratio between the air and the raw material 
equalling 0.1-0.6:1, respectively, giving a gaseous phase which is removed and a liquid product which is then subjected to 

vacuum distillation with extraction of a distillate evaporating before the temperature of 540 °C. The distillate is mixed with 
the initial petroleum crude to be processed at the distillate content of 2.0-25.0 % by weight of the total of the obtained modified 

mixture. The modified mixture is subjected to cracking.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the sphere of 
oil refining, specifically to the method of refining 
heavy oil materials. Heavy oil materials is a complex mixture of hydrocarbons 
of various chemical compositions and offer 
valuable oil material for production of a variety of 
oil refining products. One of the most valuable products 
is represented by a fraction that boils out at 
temperatures below 350°C (light distillated products), 
which are widely used as motor fuels. One of the most widely employed method for 
heavy oil material refining is a catalystic cracking. 
Under the conditions of cracking, the catalyst 
is quickly deactivated, which reduces the yeild of 
light distillated products. There are known different methods of increasing 
the output of light distillated products. One of the 
most common ways of achieving said target is the elaboration 
and construction of special catalystic systems. 
The elaboration of such systems, however, requires 
considerable expenditures. Another way is an improvement of the provision 
for cracking equipment, which is also expensive and 
limited in effectiveness. There is still another method, directed at the 
increase of light distillated product output, the 
essence of which is an introduction of various additional 
agents into the feed. For instance, oxygen-containing 
surfactants can be used as such additional 
agents.  Known is, for example, a method of vacuum gas-oil 
refining by means of the catalystic cracking 
at a temperature of from 500 to 530°C in the presence 
of a zeolite-containing aluminosilicate catalyst. 
When said method is employed, an oxyalkalized alkylphenol 
or block copolymers of ethylene and propylene 
oxides are introduced in advance (SU, A, 1474168). 
The use of additional agents with said method makes 
it possible to increase the yeild of gasoline from 
27.78 mass % to 28.92 mass %; however, said additional 
agents are very expensive products. There is a number of methods in which the catalytic 
cracking is carried out in the presence of 
oxygene, taken from air. Accroding to one of such 
methods a heavy oil raw material is heated up to 
450-550°C and mixed with air. The mixture is fed to 
the reactor having a fixed bed of an aluminosilicate 
catalyst. The temperature of cracking is additionally 
raised by burning a part of the charged 
feed in the upper section of the reactor. When said method is employed, air is used with 
a solo aim of increasing temperature in the reactor. 
Thanks to it conversion can be enhanced, however,

to 530°C in the presence of a zeolite-containing 
aluminosilicate catalyst, characterized 

in that a part of the original heavy oil materials 
and/or a heavy oil material, different in composition 

from the original oil material, is subjected to 
modification by means of an air treatment at a temperature 

of from 200 to 300°C, an air oil material

a gas phase and its removal from the system and a

out at a temperature below 540°C, and its subsequent 

mixing with the original heavy oil materials,

25.0 mass % from the total quantity of the modified 
mixture obtained, which is subjected to cracking. 
The method according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that in case a residual heavy oil 

material is refined, prior to the vacuum distillation 
said liquid product is mixed with this oil material, 

taken in the quantity up to 90 mass % of the 
total quantity of the mixture obtained.
