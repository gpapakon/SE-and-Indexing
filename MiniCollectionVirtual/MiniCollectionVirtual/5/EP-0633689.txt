<ABSTRACT>
An infrared solid-state image sensor includes at 
least any one of a pixel line selecting circuit (810, 820) 

selecting at a first time a horizontal pixel line which is 
the farthest from a horizontal charge transfer element 

(500), a vertical driving circuit (910) transferring 
signal charge in the reverse direction in a vertical 

charge transfer element (130, 230, 330) before 
transferring the same in the forward direction, or charge 

input means (1001-1003; 1010; 119, 219, 319) for filling 
input charges into the vertical charge transfer elements 

(130, 230, 330).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
an infrared solid-state
image sensor according to the preamble of claim 1.In Fig. 3, an infrared solid-state image sensor of a
CSD (Charge Sweep Device) type of the prior art is shown
in a schematic block diagram. A solid-state image sensor
of the CSD type is described in detail in, for example,
IEEE Journal of Solid State Circuits, Vol. SC-22, 1987,
pp. 1124-1129.The infrared solid-state image sensor of Fig. 3
includes photodetectors 111-118, 211-218, 311-318 disposed
as a two-dimensional pixel matrix in the horizontal
direction and the vertical direction. Transfer gates 121-128,
221-228, 321-328 control transfer of signal charge
from photodetectors 111-118, 211-218, 311-318 to vertical
charge transfer elements 130, 230, 330, respectively.
Storage gates 140, 240, 340 temporarily store the signal
charge transferred from vertical charge transfer elements
130, 230, 330, respectively. Storage control gates 150, 
250, 350 control transfer of signal charge from storage
gates 140, 240, 340, respectively, into a horizontal
charge transfer element 500. A preamplifier 600 provides
through an output terminal 700 a voltage signal converted
in proportion to an amount of signal charge provided from
horizontal charge transfer element 500.A pixel line selecting circuit 800 is a shift
register, which selects one of pixel lines in the
horizontal direction (for example, lines 118, 218, 318).
In Fig. 3, for simplification of the figure, connection
lines relating to pixel line selecting circuit 800 are
omitted. Fig. 4 shows a connection relationship between
pixel line selecting circuit 800 and transfer gates 121-128,
221-228, 321-328. Each of stages 801-808 in pixel
line selecting circuit 800 is connected to a corresponding
one of transfer gate lines arranged in the horizontal
direction. More specifically, if, for example, pixel line
selecting circuit 800 opens transfer gates 128, 228, 328
through stage 808, signal charge from photodetectors 118,
218, 318 is transferred into vertical charge transfer
elements 130, 230, 330, respectively.Pixel line selecting circuit 800 generates clock
signals as shown in Fig. 5. More specifically, a period
from the time when the output of the nth stage of pixel
line selecting circuit 800 attains an H (high) level to 
the time when the (n-1)th stage attains an H level is one
horizontal period tH. One horizontal pixel line is
selected for every horizontal period tH. In other words,
one horizontal period corresponds to a time during which
one horizontal pixel
