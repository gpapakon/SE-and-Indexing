<ABSTRACT>
A base (10) for an electrodeless arc discharge lamp 
having an elongated tubular stem (64) extending through an 

outer envelope pinch or press seal includes a pair of 
electrically non-conductive members secured in mating 

relation to define an upper cavity (30) and a lower axial 
bore (14). The lamp is mounted in the base with its pinch 

seal secured in the cavity (30) and its stem (64) extending 
into the bore (14). With the base mounted in a fixture, 

RF energy is coupled into the lamp to excite 
the stem (64) via a conductive bushing (50) in 

the bore (14).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an assembly of 
an electrodeless high intensity discharge 
lamp and a lamp base. More particularly this invention relates to an 
electrically non-conductive base for an electrodeless 
arc discharge lamp having an outer envelope press 
sealed over a tubular lamp stem containing a starting 
aid, wherein the base is secured, in clamshell 
fashion, to the press seal portion of the lamp and 
contains means for coupling RF energy to the starting 
aid for energizing the lamp. High intensity electroded arc discharge lamps 
such as high pressure sodium lamps and metal halide 
lamps are well known and include a light-transmissive 
arc discharge chamber or tube hermetically sealed and 
enclosing within a pair of spaced apart electrodes 
and a suitable fill such as an inert starting gas and 
one or more ionizable metals or metal halides. Two 
of the major causes of lamp failure are sputtering of 
electrode material onto the lamp envelope and thermal 
and electrical stresses which result in electrode 
failure. More recently a new class of high intensity 
arc discharge lamps has been developed called 
electrodeless lamps. Such lamps have a 
light-transmissive, electrodeless arc chamber or tube 
generally shaped like a pillbox or oblate spheroid 
and containing a fill which comprises a suitable 
inert buffer gas and one or more metal halides.  
 
Radio frequency (RF) energy applied or coupled to the 
fill via capacitive or inductive coupling generates a 
light-emitting arc. In operation of such a lamp via 
inductive coupling, the arc tube or chamber acts as a 
single-turn secondary coil of a transformer and is 
surrounded by an RF energy excitation coil which acts 
as a primary coil. Various embodiments of such lamps 
are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patents 
US-A-4,810,938; US-A-4,959,584; US-A-5,039,903; US-A-5,059,868 and 
US-A-5,140,227 all of which are assigned to the assignee 
of the present invention. The electronics required 
for starting and sustaining the arc discharge in 
these lamps is costly and complex and also requires 
the use of a rather large copper or aluminum 
inductive drive coil to function as the primary coil 
for carrying the high frequency current required. 
Hence some development has been directed toward 
replaceable electrodeless discharge lamps, 
particularly of the high intensity type employing one 
or more metal halides as the arc sustaining fill, 
wherein the lamp itself is physically separate from 
both the electronics and the inductive drive coil.
