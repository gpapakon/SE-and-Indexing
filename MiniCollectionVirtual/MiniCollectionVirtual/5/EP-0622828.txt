<ABSTRACT>
A photomultiplier which can be easily made 
compact has a dynode unit having a plurality of dynode 

plates (6) stacked in an electron incident direction in a 
vacuum container fabricated by a housing and a base 

member integrally formed with the housing. Each 
dynode plate is constituted by welding at least two 

plates (6a,6b) overlapping each other. The welding positions (W) 
do not overlap each other in the stacking direction of 

the dynode plates. With this structure, field 
discharge at the welding portions between the dynode 

plates can be prevented to reduce noise.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electron 
multiplier and a photomultiplier. Conventionally, photomultipliers have been widely 
used for various measurements in nuclear medicine and 
high-energy physics as a γ-camera, PET (Positron 
Emission Tomography), or calorimeter. A conventional electron multiplier constitutes a 
photomultiplier having a photocathode. This electron 
multiplier is constituted by anodes and a dynode unit 
having a plurality of stages of dynodes stacked in the 
incident direction of an electron flow in a vacuum 
container. A dynode unit included in a photomultiplier is 
constituted by a plurality of dynode plates stacked in 
an incident direction of photoelectrons. Each dynode 
plate is integrally formed by welding two thin plates 
6a and  
 
6b, as shown in Fig. 1. This is because, according to 
the current etching technique, when openings serving 
as dynodes 603 are formed in each dynode plate 6, the 
minimum value of an interval L between the two 
openings on the exit side of secondary electrons, 
which are adjacent to each other on the dynode plate 
6, must be determined depending on a thickness T of 
the dynode plate 6. Therefore, when the dynodes are 
formed to increase the interval L (a pitch between the 
dynodes 603 is increased to decrease the opening ratio 
in the main surface of the plate), the thick dynode 
plate 6 is directly etched to form desired openings at 
predetermined positions of the plate. On the other 
hand, when the dynodes are formed to decrease the 
interval L (the pitch between the dynodes 603 is 
decreased to increase the opening ratio in the main 
surface of the plate), at least two thin films 
constituting the dynode plate 6 are respectively 
etched to form the openings serving as the dynodes and 
then overlapped each other to be integrally formed. When the dynode plate is to be formed by bonding 
the thin films 6a and 6b, the two films are normally 
welded to be integrally formed. This welding is 
performed at the same position of the edge of each 
dynode plate 6 from the viewpoint of manufacturing 
efficiency. Welding marks W are formed as projections  
 
projecting from the corresponding main surfaces of the 
dynode plates 6 in the stacking direction (Fig. 1). 
Therefore, the positions of the welding marks W of the 
adjacent dynode plates 6 are matched with each other 
with respect to the stacking direction of the dynode 
plates 6. For this reason, field discharge between 
the dynode plates 6 can occur at these portions to 
generate noise. In more
