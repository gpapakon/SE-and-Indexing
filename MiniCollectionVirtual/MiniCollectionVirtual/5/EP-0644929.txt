<ABSTRACT>
Gene transfer of genetic material with viral vectors or plasmids, in combination with a wound treatment chamber, into keratinocytes, especially those including a high percentage of epidermal stem cells, has been demonstrated to be particularly effective as a means of implanting genetically engineered cells and obtaining long term survival. By employing the wound chamber system, direct in vivo gene transfer can also be done to exposed cells in an open wound. Skin stem cells which are located in the hair follicles are used to greatly enhance long term survival. The use of the wound chamber system for gene transfer also allows non-invasive assessment of the success of transfer by assaying for the presence of the expressed protein in wound fluid, in contrast to the prior art use of invasive techniques, such as biopsies, in order to achieve the same assessment of early expression. A wide variety of proteins and materials can be expressed, either for secretion into the general blood and lymphatic system, or to alter the properties of the protein, for example, to not express proteins eliciting an immune response against the transplanted cell.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the use of exogenous genetic
material in the manufacture of a medicament for use in a method
of genetically engineering cells in vivo.Keratinocytes are the principle cells which cover
the surface of the body. They are capable of
producing proteins, particularly keratin, which
constitutes the main surface barrier of the body. For
several different reasons, keratinocytes are
attractive potential targets for gene transfer. Since
they are located on the surface of the body, they are
easily accessed both for gene manipulation and
monitoring. If complications from gene transfer would
occur, for instance, the development of local tumors
or local infections, these could more easily be
treated in the skin than elsewhere.To date, genetic manipulation of keratinocytes
has been done in one principal way. Skin has been
harvested, the keratinocytes have been separated from
the fibroblasts, and then the keratinocytes
individually isolated and brought into suspension.
These suspensions of keratinocytes have then been
cultured to confluence using tissue culture
techniques, as reported by Rheinwald, J.G., Green, H.

either a viral vector or plasmid, as reported by

(1990). The transfected cells are then usually
resuspended and grown on selective media in order to
increase the yield of transfection. Sheets of
keratinocytes are then transplanted back to the mammal
from which the keratinocytes were harvested.Even though the in vitro yield has been
acceptable, the in vivo yield has been unacceptably
low, both short and long term. It has been very
difficult to document any significant long term (more
than thirty days) expression with these techniques,
for example, as reported by Garlick, J.A., Katz, A.B.,
