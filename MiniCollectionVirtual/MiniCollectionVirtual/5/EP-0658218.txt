<ABSTRACT>
Infiltrate a porous, self-reinforced (beta)-Si3N4 preform with a metal or a crystallizable glass to yield a composite material. The preform possesses a low glass phase and has a density of from 50 to 70 percent of theoretical density. Prepare the (beta)-Si3N4 preform by subjecting a porous body formed from an (alpha)-Si3N4 powder composition to two sequential heat treatments. The first heat treatment occurs below the (alpha)- to (beta)-conversion temperature and results in a strengthened body that can be machined. The second heat treatment occurs above that temperature and yields the self-reinforced (beta)-Si3N4 preform. Conventional infiltration procedures with an infiltrant that is a metal or a glass results in an Si3N4/metal or Si3N4/glass composite material that has 50 to 70 percent of its volume occupied by (beta)-Si3N4 whiskers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally concerns cermets
(ceramic/metal composites) and ceramic/glass composites.
It more particularly concerns cermets and ceramic/glass
composites that contain silicon nitride as their major
ceramic phase.Silicon nitride (Si3N4) ceramics possess a number of
physical properties that make them useful in a variety of
tribological and high temperature applications. These
properties include good wear resistance, low coefficient of
thermal expansion, good thermal shock resistance, high
creep resistance, high electrical resistivity, resistance
to chemical attack, and convenient fabrication into near-net
shapes. Two of the many uses of silicon nitride
ceramics are as cutting tools, and as parts for pumps and
engines.EP-A-111922 describes a process for preparing a
sintered ceramic body by forming silicon nitride powder and
yttrium oxide powder into a formed body, sintering the body
in a non-oxidising atmosphere, optionally cutting or
grinding the sintered body and then heat treating the body
in an oxidising atmosphere.Unfortunately, Si3N4 ceramics have certain
shortcomings. They are often brittle. They also have a
fracture toughness and strength lower than might be desired
for various applications. This may be due to structural
flaws introduced by conventional manufacturing techniques. Numerous, less than completely successful, approaches
to overcome the shortcomings are known. One approach
pressure infiltrates a porous (rather than densified),
particulate Si3N4 preform with another material, such as a
metal or glass. This approach typically requires long
process times in exchange for less than desirable
improvements in physical properties.A second approach involves forming a preform from Si3N4
whiskers rather than Si3N4 powder. This approach yields
preforms that are only 30 to 40 percent dense. In other
words, the whiskers occupy only that volume of the preform.
The whiskers, after processing into a preform, typically
have low aspect ratios. If mixing times are too short, the
preforms tend to have a nonuniform distribution of whiskers
and a nonuniform density. In addition, whiskers are
susceptible to moving with respect to each other during
infiltration. This approach also usually mandates use of
special equipment and observance of procedures for handling
small whiskers during preform preparation. In addition,
Si3N4 whiskers are expensive.For instance, EP-A-337732 is directed to a process for
forming a metal-reinforced beta-silicone nitride composite
from a beta-silicone nitride

<CLAIMS>
A process for making a silicon nitride/metal or
silicon nitride/glass composite, comprising the steps of:


a. heating a porous, friable, alpha-silicon nitride
preform to a temperature and for a time sufficient to

convert the preform to a porous structure that can be
machined, shaped or drilled without crumbling;
b. subjecting the porous structure to mechanical
shaping operations sufficient to impart a desired shape to

the structure;
c. heating the porous structure to a temperature
from ≥ 1600°C to ≤ 2000°C sufficient to convert

substantially all of the alpha-silicon nitride to beta-silicon
nitride thereby resulting in a porous, self-reinforced,

beta-silicon nitride preform; and
d. infiltrating said beta-silicon nitride preform
with a metal or a glass.
A process as claimed in Claim 1 or wherein alpha-silicon
nitride occupies from 40 to 65 percent
