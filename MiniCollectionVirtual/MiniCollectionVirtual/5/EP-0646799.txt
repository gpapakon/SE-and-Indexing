<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to an
acceleration sensor used with it being incorporated in an
air bag device carried by an automobile, and more
particularly, to an acceleration sensor comprising a fault
diagnostic function.In an air bag device carried by an automobile, the air
bag device is operated according to acceleration applied at
the time of, for example, the collision. In order to ensure
the operation of the air bag device, an acceleration sensor
has been conventionally incorporated in the above described
air bag device. As this type of acceleration sensor, an
acceleration sensor using a piezoelectric element which is
deformed in conformity with acceleration applied to output
an electric signal has been proposed, as disclosed in, for
example, U. S. Patent No. 4, 700, 973.One example of a conventionally known acceleration
sensor utilizing a piezoelectric element will be described
with reference to Figs. 1 to 3.Fig. 1 is a schematic block diagram for explaining the
construction of a conventional acceleration sensor. There 
is provided a piezoelectric element 1 outputting, when
acceleration G is applied, an electric signal corresponding
to the acceleration G. Impedance converting means 2 is
electrically connected to the piezoelectric element 1. The
impedance converting means 2 converts the impedance of the
electric signal applied from the piezoelectric element 1.
Filtering means 3 comprising a band-pass filter is
electrically connected to the impedance converting means 2.
In the filtering means 3, an unnecessary signal, that is, an
out-of-band signal component is attenuated. Amplifying
means 4 is electrically connected to the filtering means 3.
In the amplifying means 4, an output signal applied from the
filtering means 3 is amplified. This acceleration sensor
has the piezoelectric element 1, the impedance converting
means 2, the filtering means 3 and the amplifying means 4,
and outputs a voltage signal corresponding to the
acceleration G from an output terminal B.The voltage signal outputted from the output terminal B
of the acceleration sensor is applied to control means 5
comprising a microcomputer arranged outside the acceleration
sensor. The control means 5 causes an air bag device for an
automobile (not shown) to perform a necessary operation on
the basis of the voltage signal applied.Figs. 2 and 3 are respectively a plan sectional view
showing the specific construction of the above described 
acceleration sensor and a cross sectional view taken along a
line B - B shown in Fig. 2. In
