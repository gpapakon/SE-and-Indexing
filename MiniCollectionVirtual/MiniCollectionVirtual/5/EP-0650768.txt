<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process and device for forming and applying a profiled strip (12) onto a substrate (14), in which a pasty, elastomerically curable, tacky polymer material (18), is formed into the profiled strip (12) and is continuously applied to the substrate (14), is thereby adhesively bonded on the latter and is subsequently cured. In order to increase the compliance of the profiled strip, preferably designed as a sealing strip, according to the invention the polymer material is formed into an open profiled strip (12), having an at least partially essentially U-shaped profile with two free legs (51), and is continuously applied to the substrate (14) by its free leg ends (50), enclosing a cavity (16).

Process for forming and applying an extruded profile 
(12) onto a substrate, whereby a paste-like, preferably 

elastomerically curable, sticky plastic material (18) 
is shaped to form the extruded profile (12) and 

continuously applied with relative movement onto the 
substrate (14) and then cured, the plastic material 

(18) being shaped into an open, at least partially 
substantially U-shaped profile with two free limbs 

(51), 
characterized in
 that the extruded profile (12) 
is continuously applied and affixed by its free limb 

ends (50) onto the substrate (14) so as to include a 
cavity (16). 
Process according to claim 1, 
characterized in
 that a 
one- or two-component reaction plastic, in particular 

polyurethane, is used as a plastic material. 
Process according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in
 
that the extruded profile (12) is extruded 

continuously, starting with the limb ends (50) and 
continuing only some time later with the further cross-sectional 

regions, and that the limb ends are applied 
and affixed onto the substrate (14) prior to complete 

extrusion of the further cross-sectional regions. 
Device for forming and applying an extruded profile 
(12) onto a substrate (14), having a die body (10), 

into which pressurized paste-like, preferably 
elastomerically curable plastic material (18) may be 

admitted through an inlet channel (20), 
characterized 
in
 that the die body (10) comprises a bottom part (22) 
and a front part (26), which adjoins the bottom part 

(22) via a bottom edge (24), as well as a die gap (28) 
which communicates with the inlet channel (20) and at 

the outlet side is open towards the bottom part (22) at  
 

two parallel application portions (32) delimited at 
their one end (30) and towards the front part (26) at a 

profile-forming portion (36), which connects the 
application portions (32) to one another at their other 

end (34) across the bottom edge (24). 
Device according to claim 4, 
characterized in
 that the 
die gap (28) in the region of the profile-forming 

portion (36) is delimited by a predominantly convex 
inner delimitation surface (38) and a predominantly 

concave outer delimitation surface (40). 
Device according to claim 4 or 5, 
characterized in
 that 
the die gap (28) along the application portions (32) 

has a constant outlet gap width. 
Device according to one of claims 4 to 6, 
characterized 
in
 that the die gap (28) along the profile-forming 
portion (36) has a variable outlet gap width. 
Device according to one of claims 4 to 7, 
characterized 
in
 that the die body (10) has a flat bottom part (22) 
which is interrupted by the application portions (32) 

of the die gap (28). 
Device according to one of claims 4 to 8, 
characterized 
in
 that the delimitation surfaces (38, 40) of the die 
gap (28) in the region of the profile-forming portion 

(36) extend in outlet direction parallel to the plane 
of the bottom part (22) over a distance corresponding 

at least to the gap width. 
Device according to one of claims 4 to 9, 
characterized 
in
 that the inner delimitation surface (38) of the die 
gap (28) at the front part (26) projects in outlet 

direction preferably by a multiple of the gap width  
 

beyond the outer delimitation surface (40) of said die 
gap. 
Device according to one of claims 4 to 10, 

characterized in
 that the die gap (28) in the region of 
the application portions (32) has a gap width which 

widens from the inside towards the bottom part (22). 
Device according to one of claims 4 to 11, 

characterized in
 that the inner delimitation surface 
(38) of the die gap (28) is formed by the outer wall of 

a die core (42) formed in the die body (10). 
Device according to one of claims 4 to 12, 

characterized in
 that the application portions (32) 
have a length corresponding at least to three times the 

outlet gap width. 
Device according to one of claims 4 to 13, 

characterized in

upon by a one- or two-component reaction plastic, in 

particular with the simultaneous formation of 
polyurethane. 
Device according to one of claims 4 to 14,

 that the die body (10) having the 
bottom part (22) directed towards the substrate (14) is 

displaceable relative to the substrate (14) along a 
predetermined path of motion with the application 

portions (32) of the die gap (28) aligned tangentially

ve to said path of motion and, in the process, 
may be acted upon by the paste-like plastic material

Use of the process according to one of claims 1 to 3 or 
of the device according to one of claims 4 to 15 to 

manufacture an elastically resilient sealing  
 

arrangement, which is firmly connected to a substrate 
(14) and together with said substrate delimits a cavity 

(16) which is closed at its periphery. 
Sealing arrangement with an extruded profile (12),
