<ABSTRACT>
This invention is directed to a low profile coaxial 
cable connector assembly for edge mounting to a planar 

electronic device, such as a printed circuit board, 
where electrical circuitry is provided thereon for 

electrically interconnecting to the assembly. The 
assembly comprises a dielectric housing (70, 130) having 

at one end thereof a pair of spaced-apart, parallel 
walls (72, 74, 134, 136) adapted to straddle and be 

secured to the planar electronic device, and at the 
opposite end thereof a chamber (86) for the reception of 

an electrically terminated coaxial cable. Within the 
other end a grounding contact clip (80, 142) is provided 

having a pair of parallelly extending spring metal arms 
(110) for receiving the terminated coaxial cable, and a 

signal contact (104, 150) for mating with the terminated 
coaxial cable. The grounding clip (80, 142) and signal 

contact (104,150) further include extensions therefrom 
for electrically interconnecting to said planar 

electronic device, where the extensions are exposed 
between the spaced-apart walls (72, 74, 134, 136) and 

may be soldered to complementary traces or pads on the 
surfaces of the planar electronic device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a low profile, 
cable connector receptacle assembly which is adapted to 
be edge mounted to an electronic planar device, such as 
a printed circuit board (PCB). More particularly, this 
invention is directed to the housing means by which the 
cable connector receptacle may be edge mounted to a PCB, 
for example. Coaxial cable receptacles for PCBs have been known 
for several years, where, such receptacles are typically 
surface mounted thereto. U.S. Patent No. 3,915,535 
represents such a device. For convenience, and by way 
of understanding and adoption herein, a coaxial cable is 
defined therein as an electrical cable containing two or 
more conductors each isolated from the others and 
running parallel to each other. A typical coaxial cable 
is one having a center conductor embedded in a 
dielectric and a woven or braided metallic shield 
surrounding the dielectric. An outer insulating jacket 
surrounds the shield. The center conductor carries the 
RF signal while the braided shield acts to shield the RF 
signal from interference; i.e., crosstalk, etc. In 
terminating the cable the shield goes to ground. One of the disadvantages associated with surface 
mounting is due to a larger profile, at least by an 
amount equal to the thickness of the planar electronic 
device, and the consequence of requiring added space to 
accommodate the assembly. Edge or straddle mounting 
offers the advantage of a reduced profile, a feature 
that will become more apparent in the description which 
follows. However, before detailing the manner by which 
the present invention accomplishes its goal of providing 
a low profile connector assembly through edge mounting, 
it will be acknowledged that others have sought to edge 
mount, as evidenced by U.S. Patent Nos. 5,190,461; 
4,656,441; and 4,138,179.  The invention hereof is directed to a low profile 
coaxial cable connector assembly for edge mounting to a 
planar electronic device, such as a printed circuit 
board (PCB), where the PCB has electrical circuitry 
thereon for electrically interconnecting to the 
assembly. The assembly comprises a dielectric housing 
having at one end thereof a pair of spaced-apart, 
parallel walls adapted to straddle and be secured to the 
planar electronic device, and at the opposite end 
thereof a cavity for the reception of an electrically 
terminated coaxial cable. The other end of the assembly 
includes a grounding contact clip having a pair of 
parallelly extending spring metal arms for receiving the 
term
