<ABSTRACT>
A process for manufacturing structural sheet metal products (P), whereby a strip (4) of sheet metal is fed along a plane ( alpha ) and cut by a laser (T) into a number of sheets (L1, ..., L4); each sheet being secured to a respective supporting surface (16) of a rotary work holder (6) and welded by a further laser (S) to the previous sheet along a common edge. A number of variations to the process and relative equipment are described, for producing square, rectangular or tapered box sections.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a combined
cutting and welding process for manufacturing structural
sheet metal products, preferably using laser beams; an
apparatus implementing such a process; and the products
manufactured thereby.Structural products with polygonal sections (e.g.
rectangular box sections) or such as to present a high
moment of inertia (section irons) for achieving a high
degree of flexural and torsional rigidity, are commonly
used in widely differing fields of industry.Depending on the type and thickness of the
material and the required shape, such products are
generally manufactured using standard permanent
deformation (pressing, bending) or extrusion techniques.A drawback common to all the above techniques is
the high cost of the equipment involved, which not only 
affects the cost of the finished product, but also
results in a substantially total absence of versatility
at production level. No firm, in fact, would normally
contemplate replacing production machinery before it is
entirely written off.In the case of permanent deformation (pressing or
bending), in particular, the loads required for
achieving marked local deformation of the material (e.g.
for deep drawing, forming sharp edges, etc.) invariably
result in springback of the material, so that the
pressed or bent part springs back to a different shape
when the load is removed.The dimensional inaccuracy resulting from this is
especially evident when the part is connected and
welded, e.g. spot welded, to another, which generally
requires that the two parts be maintained contacting under
load. When the load is removed after welding,
however, the parts nevertheless tend to relax, thus
permanently stressing the weld spots throughout the
working life of the structure. Particularly in the case
of structures subjected to repeated, impulsive stress
(e.g. vehicles), such stress is responsible for sudden,
at least macroscopic, failure of the weld spots which
spreads "domino" fashion from one spot to the next along
the weld line, at times with catastrophic consequences
to the structure.The above problem, which is partly due to traces
of machining oil in the molten material during welding, 
and which, on vaporizing, result in metallurgical
irregularities and microcracks, has to some extent been
solved by performing an additional pickling stage prior
to welding. Besides only partially solving the problem,
however, pickling adds even further expense to the
already high direct and indirect cost of conventional
methods.In addition to the oil
