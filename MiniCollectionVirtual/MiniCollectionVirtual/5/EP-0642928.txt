<ABSTRACT>
A thermosensitive recording material having an activatable recognition layer arranged on the side of a sheet-like support (base) material opposite to the recording layer, which recognition layer contains either an electron-absorbing acidic colour developer or an electron-releasing colour former.

<CLAIMS>
Thermosensitive recording material comprising a heat sensitive 
recording layer on one side of a sheet-like support 

material and a layer on the opposite side of the support 
material which comprises within a binder a reaction partner 

of a colour forming reaction between a colour former 
and an acid acceptor as reactive partners,
characterized in that
 
the layer which is provided on the opposite side of the 

support material is not a recording transfer layer and 
which comprises only electrons accepting acid acceptor or 

electrons delivering colour former. 
Thermosensitive recording material of claim 1,
characterized in that
 
the sheet-like support material is of paper or a plastic 

film in the form of a web or a sheet having a weight per 
unit area from 40 to 280 g/m
