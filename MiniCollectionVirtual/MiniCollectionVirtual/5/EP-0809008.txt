<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of controlling a non-return
fuel supply system for an internal combustion
engine.The invention also relates to a non-return fuel supply
system for an internal combustion engine which embodies
the cited method.As is known, an essential component of fuel supply
systems is a pump, called the fuel pump, for delivering
fuel from the tank to the injectors at a predetermined
pressure value. The pressure value is particularly
important, in that the delivery characteristics (the
flow rate, waiting time, flight time etc.) of an
injector depend on the pressure difference between its
ends, one communicating with the fuel pump whereas the
other is inside the intake manifold.It is known to use non-return fuel supply systems in
which the pump is positioned immediately downstream of
the fuel tank whereas the fuel pressure regulator is
positioned immediately upstream of the injectors and
has a delivery duct and a return duct respectively for
transferring fuel from the tank to the regulator and
for transferring fuel from the regulator to the tank.
The regulator also has a pressure detector in the
intake manifold, so as instantaneously to read the
value of the pressure in the intake manifold and
accordingly adjust the value of the pressure of the
fuel at the inlet of the injectors in order to
guarantee a constant pressure jump (typically 2.5 bar)
between the ends of the injectors so that the delivery
characteristics of the injectors are constant. As is known, in order to limit costs, simplify the
construction and avoid a flow of fuel returning from
the regulator to the tank via the engine, it has become
customary to use non-return fuel supply systems in
which the fuel pump and the pressure regulator are both
positioned immediately downstream of the fuel tank. In
this kind of construction, the regulator does not
comprise a pressure detector in the intake manifold,
and the delivery pressure of the fuel is kept constant
at an absolute value typically between 3 and 3.5 bar.This solution has the obvious disadvantage of not
guaranteeing a constant pressure difference between the
ends of the injectors, since the pressure at one end is
substantially equal to the delivery pressure of the
pump and is therefore constant (relative to the
pressure in the fuel tank, which is typically equal to
atmospheric pressure) whereas the pressure at the other
end is that of the intake manifold and consequently
variable during the various operating phases of the
engine and depending on variations in atmospheric
pre
