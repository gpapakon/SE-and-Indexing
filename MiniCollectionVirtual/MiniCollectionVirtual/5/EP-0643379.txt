<ABSTRACT>
Several image-holding panels, having running rollers at their 
upper corners, rest with the rollers upon parallel running tracks 

that are inclined from an input end to an output end. A transfer 
device, which may be a chain, collects the panel which arrives in 

turn by gravity to the output end of the magazine and transfers 
it to the input end of the same or of another magazine.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with an image display device, 
particularly for advertising images, such as bills for newspapers 
and magazines in newsstands, product publicity in supermarkets 
and stores, advertising messages and program information in 
banks, sports grounds, airports and railways stations, open-air 
events and similar situations. Traditionally, advertising and other communication in situations 
such as mentioned above are delivered to the public by displaying 
posters, bills and the like, which are posted on free wall areas 
on commercial premises. However, as the quantity of information 
to be presented to the public increases, often in connection with 
the development of commercial services, the display area is often 
insufficient. Moreover, even where it is possible to post all the 
desired bills on the wall, the messages, because of overcrowding, 
have little effectiveness in capturing the attention of the public. In order to display several bills or posters in one area, in an 
image display device, known from DE-U-1 939 947, a plurality of 
image-bearing panels hang from respective rods, having free-running 
rollers at opposite ends, which rollers run on parallel, 
inclined tracks, which are arranged within a cabinet, so that the 
outermost panels are visible from outside through windows in the 
cabinet. A pair of motor-driven, vertical, parallel chain loops 
have spaced hooks for grasping opposite ends of the rod attached 
to the panel which hangs at the lowermost end of said tracks and 
for carrying the panel over to the opposite end of the tracks.  
 
The panels run down from the upper to the lower end of the 
tracks under the action of gravity. A similar display device, disclosed in FR-A-421 088, has two pairs 
of oppositely inclined tracks arranged one above the other, and a 
number of vertical chains having means for lifting a panel from 
the lowermost end of the lower tracks to the uppermost end of 
the upper tracks, and for lowering a panel from the lowermost 
end of the upper tracks to the uppermost end of the lower 
tracks. Again, the device depends on gravity for moving the 
panels along the tracks. Both the above-mentioned image display devices are very sensitive 
to even slight inaccuracies in the spacing or in the leveling 
between the hooking members carried by the chains. For instance, 
if a panel is lifted by opposite hooking members which are at 
slightly differing vertical levels, the panel will lean more heavily 
on the lower member, and will tend to slide in its

<CLAIMS>
A multiple image display device, comprising a plurality of image-bearing 
panels (30) hanging from respective rods (40), each bearing two 

rollers (46) and respective projections extending beyond the rollers, at their opposite ends, which rollers run freely on parallel, 
inclined tracks (28) arranged within a cabinet (10) with windows (16, 

18, 20, 22), and a pair of vertical, parallel main chain loops (48, 50) 
driven by timed motor means (76-82) and having lifting means (90) for 

hooking opposite ends of the rod (40) attached to the panel (30) which 
hangs at the lowermost end of said tracks and for carrying it over to 

the opposite end of the tracks, characterized in that the main chain 
loops have ascending vertical spans aligned with the lower ends of the 

running tracks and extending from respective pairs of lower wheels (58) 
to respective pairs of upper wheels (52) which are closer to one another 

than said lower wheels. 
The display device of claim 1, characterized in that said projections 
on the panel rods are formed with downwardly open recesses (44) and said 

lifting means are pins (90) projecting inwardly from the main chains to 
engage the recesses. 
The display device of claim 2, characterized in that said downwardly 
open recesses (44) extend into tubular portions (42) away from the 

respective end of the rod (40). 
The display device of any of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that it 
further comprises an auxiliary chain loop (100) arranged between said 

ascending vertical spans of the main chain loops (48, 50) and descending 
spans of the main chain loops and driven synchronously with said main 

chain, so that a projection (112) carried by the auxiliary chain acts as 
an abutment for the panel to prevent swinging during transferral.  

 
The display device of claim 4, characterized in that said auxiliary 
chain loop (100) runs on gearwheels (102, 104, 106) substantially in the 

plane of one of said main chain loops (48), the auxiliary chain having a 
span parallel to the rising span of the adjacent main chain in the area 

above said running tracks, and being driven synchronously and in a 
contrary direction with said main chain. 
The image display device of claim 5, characterized in that an idle 
gearwheel (110) is arranged between the adjacent vertical spans of the 

auxiliary chain (100) and of the adjacent main chain (48) and engages 
both chains, whereby motion is transmitted from the main chain to the 

auxiliary chain. 
The image display device of claim 6, characterized in that the 
auxiliary chain (100) has a substantially horizontal span which diverges 

from the vertical plane of the running track (28), whereby said 
projection moves out to disengage the panel (30) at the end of its 

horizontal travel. 
The image display device of one of claims 4 to 7, characterized in 
that the upper gearwheels (52, 54) of said main chains (48, 50) are 

rotatably supported on stationary pivots (70) projecting from a coupling 
plate (66) having slot apertures (68) by which the coupling plate is 

bolted in an adjustable position on a plate (62) attached to the cabinet 
wall. 
The image display device of one of claims 2 to 8, characterized in 
that each of said running tracks (26, 28), comprises a cylindrical rod 

provided with integral brackets (32) having slot apertures for screw 
attachment in an adjustable position to a member (36) integral with the 

side wall of the cabinet.  
 
The image display device of claim 8 or 9, characterized in that the 
cabinet (10) is made of metal sheets welded to one another, and that 

said plates (60) and said track-mounting members (36) are welded to the 
side walls. 
The image display device of one of claims 1 to 10, characterized in 
that one of the supporting gearwheels (58) of each of the main chains 

(48, 50) is a driving wheel and in that both driving wheels are integral 
with a single shaft (76) extending transversely between the opposite side 

walls of the cabinet and being driven by an electric motor (80). 
The image display device of claim 11, characterized in that the shaft 
(76) and the motor (80) are mounted on a rigid frame (78) that is 

pivoted on a horizontal transverse axis, and is biased by traction means 
to maintain the main chains under tension. 
The image display device of claim 12, characterized in that the 
pivoting axis of said frame is near the base of the cabinet. 
The image display device of one of claims 1 to 13, characterized in 
that said main chains (48, 50) are guided between chain-confining laths 

(84) at least along their vertical spans.
