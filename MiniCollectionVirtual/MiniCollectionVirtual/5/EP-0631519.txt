<ABSTRACT>
In a method for cleaning polluted gas and/or cooling of hot gas, and a device for carrying out the method, the gas is contacted with finely divided liquid. The finely divided liquid is supplied in the form of essentially umbrella-shaped shells or essentially linear curtains, in a regular arrangement, distributed in two or more planes substantially perpendicular to the main flow direction of the gas. The finely divided liquid is supplied such that the gas is alternately concentrated and spread by the impulse action exerted by the liquid on the gas in directions perpendicular to the main flow direction of the gas. The orthogonal distance between adjacent planes in which finely divided liquid is supplied, is so adjusted that no substantial equalisation of the gas flow takes place between the planes. The supply of liquid in adjacent planes is so arranged that it, in a plane located downstream in the flow direction of the gas, takes place where the flowing gas has been concentrated by the impulse action of liquid supplied in the plane located immediately upstream.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for cleaning polluted gas and/or cooling of 
hot gas, wherein the gas is contacted with finely divided liquid for the separation of 
particles or absorption of gaseous pollutants or cooling of the gas. The finely divided 
liquid is supplied in the form of essentially umbrella-shaped shells or essentially linear 
curtains, in a regular arrangement, distributed in two or more planes substantially 
perpendicular to the main flow direction of the gas. The present invention also relates 
to a device for carrying out the method. The device comprises an inlet for polluted 
and/or hot gas, an outlet for cleaned and/or cooled gas, and a contact section located 
therebetween. The contact section accommodates a plurality of supply means provided 
for injecting finely divided liquid and arranged in two or more planes substantially 
perpendicular to the main flow direction of the gas. The solution to the technical problem contemplated in the present application can 
be applied to gas cleaning devices, so-called scrubbers, and gas cooling devices, such 
as conditioning towers and heat recovery apparatuses, of most conceivable sizes. The 
highest demands, and thus also the most important applications, however exist in large 
industries, large power plants or large incineration plants. In the following description, 
it is therefore assumed that the devices are on an industrial scale where the gas 
washing towers may have a diameter of about 1-20 m, and a height of about 1-40 m. 
For the sake of convenience the term "washing" will be used in the following as 
meaning either cleaning or cooling or both cleaning and cooling. The method is applicable only to open gas washing towers. So-called packed 
scrubbers or packed columns cannot be used as contact section in the method of the 
invention. However, in a cascade-connected arrangement, it is of course possible to 
use a combination of the suggested washing method and, for instance, packed 
columns. The method is especially well suited in contexts where gas cleaning is to be carried 
out in combination with the recovery of heat from a polluted hot gas, since the good 
contact between the liquid and the gas also promotes heat transfer.  
 Cleaning of polluted gas with a view to removing particulate or gaseous substances is 
an important and common process in today's industrialised society. A vast variety of 
techniques have been developed, and today there are often several methods to choose 
between when a gas cleaning plant is to
