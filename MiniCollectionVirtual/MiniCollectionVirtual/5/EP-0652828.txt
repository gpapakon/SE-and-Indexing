<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of application U.S. Serial
No. 589,447, filed September 27, 1990 (Docket No. 51247).This invention relates generally to coated substrate products. More
particularly, the invention relates to a substantially optically transparent coated
substrate product comprised of a parent substrate, one or more interlayers and a
diamond-like carbon layer, and to a method for producing same.The properties of glass make it an ideal substrate material for use in
many applications. In particular, the combination of optical transparency, with
reasonable strength at a nominal cost, allows the widespread use of glass products.
Glass, however, does suffer from several limitations. Glass is not a particularly
hard material, and consequently it abrades in many applications. Additionally,
glass is chemically reactive with many alkaline substances and with hydrofluoric
acid. New applications and superior performance in existing applications could be
thus realized for glass products if glass were more abrasion resistant and less
chemically reactive. Examples of glass products which could benefit from
improved abrasion resistance include eyeglass and sunglass lenses, architectural
glass, analytical instrument windows, automotive windshields and laser bar code
scanners for use in retail stores and supermarkets.Diamond-like carbon films (DLC) are well known in the art and
have been recognized as potential coatings to enhance the abrasion resistance of
various substrate materials, including glass. The DLC coatings possess excellent
optical properties and exhibit excellent resistance to abrasion and chemical attack
by various acids, including hydrofluoric acid. However, it has been found that the
DLC coatings will impart improved abrasion resistance to a substrate only if the
adherence of the coating to the parent substrate is excellent.The most obvious and common approach to coating the glass
substrate is to apply the DLC coating directly onto a clean glass surface. However, 
this approach often results in a DLC coating which displays poor adhesion and
therefore, poor abrasion resistance. DLC coatings are typically under significant
compressive stress. This stress greatly affects the ability of the coating to remain
adherent to the glass substrate. Additionally, glass often contains many alkali
oxides and other additives which can inhibit the bonding of the SiO2 in the glass to
the carbon atoms in the DLC coating. It is currently believed that the reaction
between the SiO2 in glass and the
