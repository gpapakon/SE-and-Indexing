<ABSTRACT>
In order to produce an isolation trench in a SOI substrate having a monocrystalline silicon layer (3) and an insulating layer (2), a trench (5) is etched into the monocrystalline silicon layer (3) which trench reaches as far as the insulating layer (2) and has its cross-section widened at the surface of the insulating layer (2) by etching away (6) the bottom of the monocrystalline silicon layer (3). A silicon structure (8) is formed which covers at least the side walls of the trench (5) and fills up the bottom etchings (6). The silicon structure (8) is recrystallised in a heat-treatment step and at least partially oxidised. The trench (5) is filled up with an isolation structure.

Process for fabricating an insulation trench in
an SOI substrate,


in which the SOI substrate comprises a
monocrystalline silicon wafer (1), an insulating

layer (2) made of SiO
2
 arranged on top of the said
silicon wafer, and a monocrystalline silicon layer

(3) arranged on top of the said insulating layer,
in which a trench (5) is etched into the
monocrystalline silicon layer (3), which trench

reaches down to the insulating layer (2) and the
cross section of which trench is widened at the

surface of the insulating layer (2) by means of
undercuts (6) of the monocrystalline silicon layer

(3),
in which the free space that has remained in the
trench is filled with an insulation structure (11,

12) containing SiO
2
 or silicon,

characterized in that
after the etching of the trench, a silicon structure
(7) made of amorphous silicon is formed on the

trench, which structure covers at least the side
walls of the trench (5) and fills in the undercuts

(6),
the silicon structure (7) is recrystallized in a
heat-treatment step proceeding from the interface

with the monocrystalline silicon layer (3), with the 
result that the crystal lattice in the recrystallized

silicon structure (8) adapts to the order in the
monocrystalline silicon layer (3),
the recrystallized silicon structure (8) is at least
partly oxidized.
Process according to Claim 1,

in which the silicon structure (7) is formed by the
whole-area deposition of an amorphous silicon layer

with essentially conformal edge coverage and subsequent
anisotropic etching as spacer (8).
Process according to Claim 1 or 2,

in which the silicon structure (7) is formed from doped
silicon with a dopant concentration of at least

10
18
 at/cm
3
.
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 3,

in which the recrystallization and oxidation of the
silicon structure (8) take place in a heat-treatment

step.
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 4,

in which, in order to complete the insulation
structure, free space that has remained in the trench

(5) is filled with a silicon filling (11), and
in which an insulation termination (12) is formed by
oxidizing the surface of the silicon filling (11),

and completely covers the silicon filling (11).
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 4,

in which, in order to complete the insulation
structure, free space that has remained in the trench

(5) is filled with SiO
2
 which is conformally deposited
in a CVD process.
Process according to Claim 6,

in which the trench (5) is filled in a CVD process
using a process gas containing O
3
 and Si(OC
2
H
5
)
4
.
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 7,

in which the trench (5) is etched using a trench mask
(4) comprising a layer sequence formed by a bottom

layer (41) made of SiO
2
, a middle layer (42) made of
Si
3
N
4
 and a top layer (43) made of SiO
2
.
