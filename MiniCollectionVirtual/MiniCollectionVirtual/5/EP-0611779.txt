<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a highly active olefin polymerisation catalyst for the preparation of an  alpha -olefin polymer having favourable properties. The catalyst is formed by reacting an organoaluminium cocatalyst and a selectivity regulator with a novel olefin polymerisation procatalyst prepared by reacting a tetravalent titanium halide and an electron donor with a novel solid procatalyst precursor, which is in turn obtained by reacting     (a) a carbonised magnesium alkoxide of the formula

 where R is a hydrocarbon group having up to 20 carbon atoms, and x is a number from about 0.1 to about 2, with   (b) a halosilane compound. The invention also relates to a process for the polymerisation of alpha -olefins using the novel highly active polymerisation catalyst.
