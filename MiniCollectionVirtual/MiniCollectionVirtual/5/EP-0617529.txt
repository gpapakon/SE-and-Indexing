<ABSTRACT>
A counter for attribute stored in an Ethernet system is partitioned such that 
the storage section is separated from the incrementors section. In so doing, 

counters are implemented in a significantly less space that if the counters were 
implemented as individual counters. The counter utilizes random access memory 

as the storage section and a 32 bit incrementor. As the incrementor section along 
with a pair of latches to implement the counter.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the counters utilized with a
Medium Access Controller (MAC) in a Repeater for attribute storage and more
particularly to the architecture of such counters within the Repeater.In traditional Ethernet (IEEE 802.3 10BASE5) and Cheapernet (IEEE 802.3 10BASE2)
a coaxial cable provides the linear bus to which all nodes are connected.
Signalling is accomplished using a current synch technique with a center conductor
used for the signal and a shield used as a ground reference. Twisted pair Ethernet
(IEEE 802.3 10BASE-T) utilizes standard voice grade telephone cable, employing
separate transmit and receive pairs. The system uses a star topology. At the center
of a star is a repeater. The repeater performs signal amplitude and timing
restoration. It takes the incoming bitstream and repeats it to all the ports connected
to it. In this sense the repeater acts as a logical coaxial cable so that any node
connected to the network will see another node's transmission. Differential
signalling is employed with one pair acting as the transmit path and the other pair
acting as the receive path.While repeaters are used in traditionally wired coaxial Ethernet as a means
to extend the networks physical distance limit, in the IEEE 802.3 10BASE-T, the
Standard mandates the use of a repeater to actually provide the connectivity 
function if more than two nodes are required. Although the physical signalling on
the cabling differs, the functionality of the repeater is identical in either coaxial or
twisted pair networks as is the frame or packet format that is used to pass
messages between the participating nodes on the network.The drawing of Figure 1 shows a representative ethernet packet Each
packet comprises a series of 8-bit bytes of digital information. Each packet is
preceded by a seven byte preamble composed of alternating 1s and 0s. The
preamble is followed by a one byte long start frame delimiter (SFD) which
presents the following eight bit sequence: 10101011. After the SFD, follows a
packet that can vary in length from 64 to 1518 bytes. In particular, six bytes (48
bits) of destination address immediately follow the preamble. The destination
address designates the intended destination of the packet. After the destination
address, follow six bytes of source address which designate the source of the
packet. After that, there are two bytes that designate the packet length. Then
follow between 46 and 1500 bytes of data. Finally, there are four bytes which
constitute the frame

A counter for attribute storage, the counter comprising:

random access memory RAM means (12) for storing attribute information;
means (10) coupled to the RAM means for reading the attribute information
responsive to control signals;
first latching means (14) for receiving attribute information read from the RAM
means;
means (18) coupled to the first latching means for incrementing the attribute
information; and
means (10) for writing the incremented attribute information into the RAM means
; 
characterised by
said counter being provided in a repeater based system, the repeater based system
including an internal bus;
said counter further comprising:

multiplexer means (20) coupled to the internal bus (30) and the incrementing means
for receiving a source address, for receiving the incremented attribute information and
for sending the source address;
second latching means (16) coupled to the multiplexer means and the RAM means for
receiving the incremented attribute information at a predetermined bit rate and

receiving the source address to allow for access to the RAM means;

and
