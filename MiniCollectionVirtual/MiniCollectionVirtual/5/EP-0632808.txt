<DESCRIPTION>
 ANTIVIRAL PEPTIDESThe present invention relates to certain peptide derivatives containing a heterocyclic group which are useful in the treatment or prophylaxis of human retroviral infections.The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) , a retrovirus, is the causative agent of a variety of clinical conditions, the most serious of which are commonly termed AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome) , and ARC (AIDS-Related Complex) . Infection with HIV is characterised by progressive breakdown of the immune system and CNS dysfunction. Severely immune deficient patients suffer from a wide range of opportunistic infections (e.g. pneumocystis carinii, human cytomegalovirus, or Candida) , and cancers such as Kaposi's sarcoma. Loss of cells, particularly CD4 lymphocytes, following infection with HIV is an important factor in the progressive impairment of immune function. The infection of cells of monocyte/macrophage lineage with HIV also contributes to the observed pathology. Thus, successful infection of CD4 cells by HIV is a key step in the disease process.HIV is a retrovirus; it encodes its genetic information in RNA, which is converted into DNA after the virus enters the host cell. An essential step in the retroviral replication cycle is the processing of an initial polypeptide precursor into mature structural and replicative proteins. This processing is carried out by a virus-coded protease and, in the absence of this enzyme activity, viral replication is blocked.We have discovered that certain peptide derivatives linked to a heterocyclic group are potent inhibitors of retroviral proteases, both in a cell-free assay and in infected cells and, in addition, show antiviral activity in tissue culture assays. This 

activity renders such compounds useful for the treatment and prophylaxis of retroviral infections, in particular, those caused by HIV.Thus, the present invention provides compounds having the formula(I) and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and bioprecursors therefor, wherein-:R1 is C!-C6 alkyl, C3-C8 cycloalkyl, aryl, heterocyclyl or CONR9R10;R2 is Ci-Cg alkyl, C3-C8 cycloalkyl(Cj-C4)alkyl, aryl(Cj-Qt)alkyl or heterocyclyl(Cι~C4)alkyl;R3 is Cx-C6 alkyl, C3-C8 cycloalkyl, C3-C8 cycloalkyl(C,-C4)alkyl, aryl(C,-C4)alkyl, aryl(C2-C4)- alkenyl, heterocyclyl(Cx-C4)alkyl or heterocyclyl(Cj-d)- alkenyl;R4 is C!-C6 alkyl, C3-C8 cycloalkyl, aryl or heterocyclyl; each of R5, R6, R7 and R8 is independently H, 0,-Cg alkyl or C3-C8 cycloalkyl; or R5 and R6, or R7 and R8 may be joined together to form a 3 to 8
