<ABSTRACT>
A vent for a removable toilet holding tank includes a 
valve member (136) that is in communication with both the holding 

tank interior and the ambient atmosphere and is moved off its 
valve seat (96,98) when the pressure within the holding tank exceeds 

the ambient pressure by an amount sufficient to overcome the 
force of gravity acting to hold the valve member (136) against its 

valve seat (96,98). The vent further includes a second valve member (110) 
which is operable to close the vent when the holding tank is 

removed from the toilet bowl thereby precluding spillage of the 
tank contents during handling of the tank when separated from 

the toilet bowl.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to vent assemblies for use in toilet systems having
removable waste holding tanks and in particular to toilet systems
comprising such vent assemblies as a pressure
relief vent for relieving internal pressure build-up within the
waste holding tank.Toilet systems have been developed in which a toilet bowl
is removably coupled to a waste holding tank. Waste from the
toilet bowl is flushed into the holding tank for storage until
disposal at a later time. When the holding tank is filled with
waste, it is removed from the bowl and carried to a disposal
site where the contents are dumped from the tank.Such a toilet system can be integrally formed in a
recreational vehicle as shown in Assignee's U.S. Patent No.
4,776,631. Alternatively, the toilet system can be a two-piece
portable toilet such as that disclosed in Assignee's U.S. Patent No.
4,145,773. These patents are hereby incorporated by reference.The removable waste holding tanks disclosed in the above
referenced parents include an inlet port through which waste
enters the tank from the toilet bowl. The inlet port is
equipped with a valve for closing the port when the toilet is
not in use and for opening the port when waste is to be flushed
from the toilet into the holding tank. The valve includes an
appropriate seal to prevent the escape of odors from the tank
and to prevent leakage during handling of the portable tank.Once waste has accumulated in the holding tank, biological
processes take place in the tank to begin the breakdown of the
waste. These processes result in the production of vapor 
within the holding tank, increasing the tank pressure. The
pressure within the holding tank my also deviate from the
ambient pressure for various other reasons, such as travel to a
higher altitude.A pressure within the tank greater than the ambient
pressure can create problems for the user of the toilet. For
example, if a liquid, such as a chemical deodorant is
introduced into the toilet bowl for flushing into the holding
tank, a jet-like gas discharge from the holding tank through
the liquid in the bowl may occur as the inlet port valve is
initially opened, causing an upward spray of the liquid.A method that allows venting of a building's sewer system
when there is only a small increase in pressure within the
system is disclosed in U. S. Patent 5,209,257. This patent
discloses a vent for relieving pressure in a sewage system that
is installed at the upper end of a vertical clean-out pipe. The
vent assembly includes a threaded plug
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A vent assembly for use in a water use sanitary system
including a waste holding tank removably coupled to said

system, said vent assembly venting the interior of the
waste holding tank to relieve excessive internal pressure

from said holding tank, comprising:

a vent body (74) having an opening therethrough
forming a passage (92) for air flow from said tank

interior to atmosphere, said passage (92) having a first
end exposed to the atmosphere and a second end (104)

exposed to the tank interior and said vent body (74)
including a first valve seat (96) surrounding said passage

(92) at said first end;
a first valve member (136) positioned upon said first
valve seat (96) covering said opening to close the

interior of the tank (50) from atmosphere, said first
valve member (136) being held against said first valve

seat (96) by gravity, said first valve member (136) having
an interior surface (140) in communication with the

interior of the holding tank (50) through said passage
(92) and an exterior surface (142) in communication with

atmosphere whereby when the internal pressure in said tank
(50) exceeds atmospheric pressure by an amount sufficient

to overcome the force of gravity acting on said first
valve member (136), said first valve member (136) is moved

off said first valve seat (96) allowing gas from said tank
interior to be vented to atmosphere until the internal

pressure in the tank (50) is reduced sufficiently for said
first valve member (136) to be returned by gravity against

said first valve seat (96) to cover said opening; and a
second valve member (110) to close said passage when said

holding tank (50) is disconnected from said system.
The vent assembly of Claim 1 further comprising:

a second valve seat (108) surrounding the passage
(92) at the second end thereof;
said second valve member (110) being movable into
engagement with said second valve seat (108) to close and

seal said passage (92) from the interior of said tank
(50);
bias means (118) for applying a moving force on said
second valve member (110) to move said second valve member

(110) into engagement with said second valve seat (108) to
prevent the discharge of the tank contents through said

passage (92) during handling of said tank (50); and
release means (124) for overcoming said moving force
on said second valve member (110) when said tank (50) is

coupled to said sanitary fixture (44) whereby said second
valve member (110) is disengagable from said second valve

seat (108) thereby placing said passage (92) in
communication with said tank interior and permitting

excess pressure within said tank (50) to be vented through
said passage (92).
The vent assembly of claim 2 wherein said second valve
seat (108) is a flexible seal.
The vent assembly of claim 2 or 3 wherein:

said bias means includes a button (114) coupled to
said second valve member (110)
 and a compression spring
(118) disposed between said button (114) and said vent

body (74) to move said second valve member (110) against
said second valve seat (108); and 
said release means includes a cam (124) extending
from an upper portion (46) of said sanitary system for

engaging and depressing said button (114) in opposition to
said spring (118) when said tank (50) is coupled to said

fixture (44) allowing said second valve member (110) to
move away from said second valve seat (108).
The vent assembly of anyone of claims 2 to 4 wherein said
second valve member (110) is lifted into engagement with

said second valve seat (108) and further comprising float
means (144) for lifting said second valve member (110)

into engagement with said second valve seat (108) to
prevent leakage of the tank contents through said passage

(92) in the event the level of waste in said tank (50)
reaches said second valve member (110).
The vent assembly of any one of claims 1 to 5 wherein said
passage is an annular vent passage (92).
A water use sanitary system comprising:

an upper portion (46) containing a water use sanitary
fixture (44) having a lower discharge outlet (58) through

which waste is drained from said fixture (44);
a holding tank (50) removably coupled to said
discharge outlet (58) for receiving waste therefrom, said

tank (50) being removable from said fixture (44) to enable
the disposal of waste from said tank (50), said tank (50)

having a top wall (52) with a port (54) therethrough for
receiving the waste and a second port therethrough ; and
a vent assembly according to any one of claims 1 to
6, said assembly being disposed in said second port for

venting the interior of said tank (50) to the ambient
atmosphere.
