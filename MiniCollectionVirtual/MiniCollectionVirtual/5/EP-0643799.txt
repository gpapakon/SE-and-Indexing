<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for modifying an exhaust stream of a diesel engine is provided. The apparatus includes a muffler arrangement (1) having an exhaust inlet (17), an exhaust outlet (18) and means (5, 7) for sound attenuation. The apparatus also includes a catalytic converter arrangement (50) positioned within the muffler arrangement (1). During operation, the exhaust flow is directed both through the muffler arrangement (1) and the catalytic converter arrangement (50).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to muffler 
assemblies and in particular to muffler assemblies of a 
type used to dampen exhaust noise produced by internal 
combustion engines. The invention specifically concerns 
such arrangements having catalytic converters therein. Catalytic converters have been widely utilized 
with internal combustion engines, typically gasoline 
powered engines. In operation, an oxidizing catalytic 
converter comprises a post combuster through which 
emissions from the internal combustion process are 
directed. The catalyst promotes the conversion of carbon 
monoxides and hydrocarbons in the emissions to carbon 
dioxide and water vapor. In a typical application, the catalytic converter 
is located in the exhaust system as close to the exhaust 
engine manifold as practical. In this manner, advantage 
is taken of available heat in the exhaust gases to 
minimize the time lag in reaching the desired operating 
(reaction) temperature. The typical catalyst is a noble 
metal such as platinum or palladium. As indicated above, typically catalytic 
converters have been utilized with gasoline powered 
internal combustion engines, rather than diesel engines 
such as truck engines. There are numerous reasons for 
this. For example, trucks typically have very limited 
space for the placement of catalytic equipment in the 
exhaust system. The largest space available is occupied 
by the muffler, leaving little if any room for effective 
placement of a catalytic converter. It is not generally 
reasonable to reduce the size of the muffler to allow for 
placement of a converter assembly. This is because 
reduction in the size of the muffler will generally lead 
to less sound attenuation and higher backpressure.  
 In addition, in a diesel powered truck system 
the acceptable amount of resistance to flow in the 
exhaust stream is strictly limited. More specifically, 
an effective muffler system for a diesel engine truck 
typically provides a backpressure close to the maximum 
backpressure allowable for efficient engine use. The 
added backpressure which would be introduced by 
placement of a conventional catalytic converter 
arrangement in the exhaust stream (in addition to the 
conventional muffler) would typically be unacceptably 
close to (if not over) the maximum backpressure 
allowable and would reduce fuel efficiency. Nevertheless, there are reasons why it may be 
desirable to introduce a catalytic converter into a 
diesel exhaust flow stream. In particular, the catalyst 
allows for the oxidation
