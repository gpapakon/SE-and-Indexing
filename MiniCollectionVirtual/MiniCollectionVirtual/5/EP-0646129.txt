 RECEPTOR-TYPE TYROSINE KINASE-LIKE MOLECULESFIELD OF INVENTION The present invention relates to proteins having receptor-type tyrosine kinase-like properties which represent a novel family of proteins related to protein tyrosine kinases. The present invention relates to the full length proteins and to subunits, mutants, derivatives and/or analogues thereof and to nucleotide sequences-encoding same. The present invention also extends to ligands for the above proteins and to pharmaceutical compositions comprising the proteins and/or mutants, derivatives and/or analogues thereof and/or ligands thereto.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on protein substrates is a pathway whereby signals of growth and differentiation are transmitted by growth factor receptors and transforming oncogenes (1). Evidence for this role of tyrosine phosphorylation came from the identification of receptors which bind known soluble growth factors. For example, the receptors for epidermal growth factor (EGF) (2), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) (3) and colony stimulating f actor-1 (CSF-1 ) (4) were all shown to be transmembrane molecules with the cytoplasmic regions defining a tyrosine lάnase catalytic domain (5).The other line of evidence for a critical role played by tyrosine phosphorylation in growth control came from the study of viral oncogenes (6-7). These genes were shown to be directly involved in growth dysregulation by observations of a change in cell growth following introduction of DNA encoding these genes into fibroblasts. All oncogenes have been shown to have close cellular homologues (proto- oncogenes). One of the first identified oncogenes was v-src, the cellular homologue (c-src) is the prototypical representative of the family of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases which, following myristylation, become associated with the inner leaf of the cell membrane (8). 

Protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) represent a family of phosphotransferases related by their conserved catalytic domains (reviewed in 7 and 25). Phylogenetic analysis of this family suggests that several subfamilies of the PTKs exist based on the organisation. of their non-catalytic sequences. These families include i) The Src related PTKs such as c-yes, c-lyn and hck; ii) the JAK family; and iii) at least seven subfamilies of growth factor receptors.In particular, these previously known PTKs contain the Rossman motif (32) which is putatively associated with ATP binding. The Rossman motif has three invariant glycine residues in a
