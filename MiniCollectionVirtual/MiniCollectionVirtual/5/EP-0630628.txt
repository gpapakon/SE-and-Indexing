<ABSTRACT>
A medical bandage that permits the support to be 
easily peeled off from the substrate without the substrate 

stuck to the wound skin being pulled up. It is composed 
of a substrate (1), a support (5) consisting of butted two 

pieces of plastics film having at least one extension part 
(5a) extending beyond the end (1a) of the substrate (1), and a 

releasable strip (8) of plastics adhesive tape stuck to the 
butting part (6), said adhesive tape having non-adhesive 

side parts.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a medical bandage,
said medical
bandage being designed to be applied to burned, injured,
or inflamed skins of a human and/or animal body for their
protection or to be used to fix a medical instrument (such
as catheter) on the skin.A bandage is generally used to protect burned, injured,
or inflamed skins or to fix a medical instrument
(such as catheter) on the skin. Such a bandage has an
adherent property and high permeability to oxygen and
water vapor or has impermeability to water vapor so as to
prevent the skin from drying. In addition, it has to
fully conform to the contour of the body part to be covered.
Moreover, it has to be very thin in the form of
film or foil because it is applied directly to the skin.
Such a thin bandage, however, involves difficulties in its
application, in particular if large surface areas are to
be covered, in which case it is liable to wrinkle and
stick to itself.In order to overcome these difficulties, there have
been proposed several thin film-like or foil-like bandages 
and methods for applying them to patients. For example,
U.S. Patent No. 4,372,303 discloses a bandage which is
provided on its back side with a stiffening frame as a
means to assist its application which is removed after its
application. This proposal may be useful for bandages to
cover a relatively large flat part. However, the stiffening
frame is inconvenient to applying the bandage to
curved body parts. In addition, the stiffening frame
obstructs the visual field.To solve this problem, U.S. Patent No. 4,374,520
proposed a bandage having two supporting ledges only at
the longitudinally opposed edges. However, such a bandage
cannot be used under all circumstances due to the stiff
ledges and the obstructed visual field.A bandage free of the foregoing disadvantages is
disclosed in European Patent No. 51,935, which forms the preamble of independent claim 1. It is composed
of a film substrate and a support attached to its back,
said support being stiffer than the film substrate and
extending beyond one edge of the film substrate, the
extended end serving as a grasp strip. This bandage has
its adhesive layer covered with release paper which also
extends beyond one edge of the film substrate, the extended
end serving as a grasp strip. The support is removed
after the bandage has been applied, with the release paper
peeled off. Such an invention offers an advantage that 
the substrate is kept clean and free from wrinkling and
curling owing to the support placed thereon and that
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A medical bandage of the type having a substrate (1) of
plastic film or foil, a pressure-sensitive adhesive layer (2) formed on one

side of said substrate (1), a release paper (3) placed on said pressure-sensitive
adhesive layer (2), a support (5) and a releasable strip (8) for the

support, 
characterised in that
 said support (5) consists of two pieces of
plastics film which are butted at right angles to the longitudinal direction

and are peelably fusion-bonded to the substrate (1) except for the butting
part (6), such that said support (5) is peeled off at the butting part (6) from

said substrate (1) after the bandage has been applied to a patient, said
releasable strip (8) being an adhesive tape of desired width stuck to the

butting part (6) in the same direction as the butting part (6), said adhesive
tape having non-adhesive parts (8a) on both of its longitudinal sides.
A medical bandage as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterised in
that
 the two pieces of the support (5) are butted at a position between
approximately 1/5 and 4/5 of the length of the substrate (1) measured from

one end thereof in the longitudinal direction.
A medical bandage as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised in
that
 there is a grasp strip (4) which is partly in contact with the pressure-sensitive
adhesive layer (2) over a certain length from the end of the

substrate (1), and 
in that
 the support (5) is fusion-bonded to the substrate
(1) such that the peel strength between them is greater than that between

the release paper (3) and the pressure-sensitive layer (2) or between the

grasp strip (4) and the pressure-sensitive layer (2) and is smaller than that
between the support (5) and the releasable strip (8) for the support.
A medical bandage as claimed in any of the claims 1 to 3,

characterised in that
 the releasable strip (8) is bonded to the support (5) 
such that the peel strength between them is smaller than one half that

between the pressure-sensitive layer (2) and the adherend.
A medical bandage as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4,

characterised in that
 the support (5) is fusion-bonded to the substrate (1)
such that the peel strength between them is 10-100 g/25 mm width.
A medical bandage as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5,

characterised in that
 the releasable strip (8) is bonded to the support (5)
such that the peel strength between them is 15-150 g/25 mm width.
