<ABSTRACT>
An antenna device (40) for a hand portable phone (1) having a first conducting layer (41)
acting as resonator plane, a second conducting layer (24) arranged substantially in

parallel with the first conducting layer (41) and acting as ground plane for the
antenna device (40), and feeding means (22,23,42) connected to said first (41) and the second

conducting layer (24) for feeding an RF signal to the antenna device (40). The first
conducting layer (41) is provided as a radiating pattern having a common

frequency part (39) coherent with two further parts where said common frequency
part (39) in combination with said two further parts defines a first radiating element (48)

and a second radiating element (49), respectively. Capacitive couplings are provided between
the first (41) and the second (24) conducting areas adjacent to the crossing areas

between said common frequency part (39) and the respective one of said two
further parts.

The capacitive couplings (58,54) are used for tuning the resonance
frequencies of the radiating elements (48,49). The antenna device is

arranged on the dual-band portable phone (1) and is adapted for

communication via a cellular network (GSM 900MHz and GSM 1800MHz).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a dual band antenna for a handset. Such an antenna
includes a metallic plate or layer acting as ground plane for the antenna, a
resonator plate or layer acting as radiating element(s), and a feeding point
supplying the signal to the antenna. When the ground plane and the resonator
plane are electrically coupled the feeding point will be placed in a position
where the antenna is matched to the RF output of the handset. Such
antennas are known as Planar Inverted F-Antennas (PIFA).Until a few year ago all phones for cellular communication were equipped with
an extendable antenna element, as known from e.g. the phone sold under the
tradename Nokia 2110™. Later on this extendable antenna element was
substituted by an external helix antenna, as known from e.g. the phone sold
under the tradename Nokia 6110™. Recently the applicant has launched a
phone sold under the tradename Nokia 8810™ and this phone includes an
internal antenna based on the PIFA concept. The antenna is a so-called
single band antenna and the present version it is adapted for GSM in the 900
MHz band (uplink 890-915 MHz and downlink 935-960 MHz). The antenna
element will have an electric length corresponding to a quarter wavelength
and placing a dielectric between the ground a resonator plane the overall
physical dimensions is reduced. The overall dimensions of the PIFA are
reduced to 32 x 20 x 4 mm.WO 95/24746 describes an internal antenna having a dielectric body coated
with a metallic layer on two substantially parallel surfaces. This antenna is a
single band antenna for the GSM 900 MHz band only. Basically a plastic body
is moulded and with metal. Afterwards a pattern is created in the metallic layer 
by removing parts of the coated surfaces by milling. This concept has been
used in the phone marketed by Hagenuk under the tradename Global
Handy™.US 5.764.190 describes a capacity loaded PIFA according to which an extra
plate is interposed in between the ground plane and the radiating element.
This requires that a two-shot molding process be used in addition to several
coating processes.A letter by C.R. Rowell and R.D. Murch, "A Compact PIFA suitable for dual
frequency 900/1800MHz operation", is published in IEEE Transactions on
Antennas and Propagation, April 1998, Volume 46, Number 4. This letter is
written by the inventors mentioned in US 5.764.190, and describes further
improvement of the three layered antenna concept. The improvement
includes providing of a longitudinal slit in the resonator layer in order to
