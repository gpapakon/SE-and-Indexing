<ABSTRACT>
A skate (10) in which the runner, such as an ice skate blade (16) 
mounted in a support member, is hingedly (33) connected at the front end 

thereof to a support member (24) mounted at the sole plate in the toe 
area of the boot (12). A retractable and expandable telescopic member is 

provided at the rear of the skate including a stub shaft fixedly mounted 
to a heel plate to which a threaded cylinder (38) is rotatably mounted 

and engages a threaded pedestal (36) extending upwardly from the support 
member, and rotation of the threaded cylinder will cause retraction or 

contraction of the support and the blade securely mounted in the support 
about the rotation about the pivot pin extending through the front of 

the boot.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to skates, and 
more particularly, to a skate having a boot and a runner 
attached to the sole of the boot. Ice skates, and recently a dry land skate 
known typically under the trade-mark "Rollerblade", 
generally have a boot with a sole, a support for mounting 
the runner, and the runner, which in the former is 
an ice skate blade and in the latter a series of longitudinally 
aligned wheels. Other types of skates exist, 
such as roller skates, which are well known. There are 
different categories of ice skates, such as hockey 
skates, figure skates, and racing skates. Conventional 
figure skates do not have a runner support per se, but 
the blade, being thicker, is stamped in one piece and 
includes struts to be welded to a sole and heel plate, 
which in turn are connected to the sole of the boot. The other skates mentioned above generally 
have a support structure separable from the runner. In 
the case of ice hockey skates, the support is made of 
molded plastics material with a kerf along the bottom 
edge for receiving the metal blade and a front and rear 
pedestal for attachment to the boot sole. Racing skates 
and some models of hockey skates have a support made of 
sheet metal formed into tubes with a separate blade secured 
by the support. It has been known, at least in ice hockey 
skates, to adjust the contour of the ice contact edge 
of the blade to comply to the preferred location of the 
center of gravity of the player. For instance, the center 
of gravity of a player can be shifted forward or 
rearward by adjusting the angle of the edge of the 
blade relative to the axis of the player's body. By reducing the angle, the center of gravity 
of the player is shifted forwardly. This can be done by 
grinding the skate blade so that the edge of the blade 
converges with the sole of the boot from the rear to 
the front of the skate. When a player wears the skate  
 
boot and stands on the blades which have been so 
ground, his body will tend to lean forward. If it is 
desired to shift the center of gravity rearwardly, the 
skate blade will be ground in the opposite direction, 
that is, to increase the angle and, therefore, make the 
edge of the blade converge with the sole of the boot, 
from the front to the rear of the skate. In hockey, it has been found that a forward 
or "offense" player will want to have the angle of the 
blade reduced so as to shift the center of gravity forward. 
This is an important feature since the boots are 
anatomical, and the maximum limit

<CLAIMS>
A skate (10, 48) having a skate boot (12, 50) with a boot sole (14) 
having a toe portion, a metatarsal portion, and a heel 

portion, a runner (16) including a runner support (18, 56), a first 
support mounting member on the toe portion of the sole 

and a second support mounting member at the heel portion 
of the sole, characterised in that the runner support (18, 56) and the first support 

mounting member have a hinge connection with an 
axis of rotation extending laterally to the runner (16) and 

including a fixed plate (20, 52) and a U-shaped bracket (32, 54) with a 
pivot pin (33) such that the first support rotates about the 

lateral axis but is constant in height, an extension-retraction 
connecting member between the runner support (18, 56) 

and the second support mounting member including a 
first threaded pedestal member (36, 66) mounted to the runner 

support (18, 56) and a threaded cylindrical member (38, 64) rotatably 
mounted to the second support mounting member such that 

rotation of the threaded cylindrical member will cause 
the retraction or extension of the threaded pedestal (36, 66), 

whereby adjustment of the connecting member to retract 
or extend the connecting member will cause adjustment 

of the angle of the runner and the runner support (18, 56) relative 
to the boot (12, 50) about the lateral axis passing through 

the pivot pin (33) on the first support mounting member. 
A skate as defined in claim 1, wherein the 
runner (16) is in the form of an ice skate blade securely 

mounted in the support. 
A skate as defined in claim 1, wherein the 
skate is a hockey skate with an ice hockey skate blade (16) 

securely mounted in a molded plastics runner (18). 
A skate as defined in claim 1, wherein the 
runner includes a series of in-line wheels (58) each rotatably 

mounted on the support (56).  
 
A skate as defined in claim 1, wherein the 
cylindrical member (38, 64) is provided with a cursor (42) and the 

runner support includes a projection (34) adjacent the 
cylindrical member (38, 64) and a scale (40) with indicia is provided 

on the projection (34) such that the cursor (42) on the cylindrical 
member (38, 64) will indicate the degree of angle of adjustment 

between the runner (16) and the skate boot (12, 50) in respect 
of the pivot pin (33) at the first support mounting member.
