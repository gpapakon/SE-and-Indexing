<ABSTRACT>
A downwardly facing fork means (10) is provided, together with a 
transverse bar (13) movable between the lateral legs (12) of the 

fork (10) to lock the vehicle pedal levers (7) between the bar 
(13) and the top of the fork means (10); the device is provided 

with cap pieces (30), each having a longitudinal cavity (31) into 
which a respective lateral leg (12) is insertion-fitted, to reduce 

the useful width of the fork (10) and/or increase the length of 
the lateral legs (12); and extension pieces (35) to be fixed to 

the two ends of the transverse bar (13) to correspondingly 
lengthen said bar (13), the extension pieces (35) being positioned 

a short distance from and facing the inner lateral faces of the 
lateral legs (12) or of the cap pieces (30) applied to these, when 

the transverse bar (13) is in its locking position;
 

said extension pieces (35) are applied to the fork (10) as an 
alternative to those cap pieces (30) used for reducing the useful 

width of the fork 10.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a mechanical antitheft device for motor 
vehicles. For this purpose antitheft devices are known based on a downwardly 
facing fork with an upper transverse element and two substantially 
vertical lateral legs, and acting in combination with a transverse 
bar parallel to the upper transverse element. The transverse bar 
can be moved between said lateral legs to withdraw from or 
approach the upper transverse element, and can be locked by a key 
lock in such a position as to clamp the levers of the vehicle 
clutch and brake pedals between the bar and the fork means. This has the effect of coupling the two brake and clutch pedals 
together while at the same time preventing them from being 
lowered, so that the vehicle cannot be driven. Two requirements of said device are very important in determining 
effective antitheft action. The first is that the clutch and brake pedals must project 
externally from their respective levers, while the useful width of 
the fork (ie the distance between the inner lateral faces of the 
two lateral legs) must be such that the lateral legs embrace the 
pedal levers with only a slight clearance. This prevents the fork 
being able to be withdrawn from the levers, because the pedals 
strike against the lateral legs.  The second requirement is that the fork must touch the floor when 
in the locked state, so that the brake and clutch cannot be 
operated. Any excessive clearance would enable these controls to 
be at least partly operated, with the risk that the thief could 
remove the vehicle. As both the distance between the brake and clutch pedal levers and 
the distance between these levers and the vehicle floor vary in 
the various vehicles, different antitheft models must be produced 
in which the fork and transverse bar dimensions vary. An object of the present invention is to obviate said drawback by 
providing an improved mechanical antitheft device which can be 
adapted to different vehicle models within the framework of a 
relatively simple and economical construction, and which is highly 
effective in terms of its antitheft action. This and further objects are attained by the invention as 
characterised in the claims. The invention is described in detail hereinafter with the aid of 
the accompanying figures, which illustrate one embodiment thereof.

An improved mechanical antitheft device for motor 
vehicles, comprising: 


a downwardly facing fork means (10) having an upper transverse 
element (11) and two substantially vertical lateral legs (12); 
a transverse bar (13) movable between the lateral legs (12) 
away from or towards the upper transverse element (11) and be 

locked by a lock (25) in such a position as to lock the levers (7) 
of the motor vehicle pedals between the bar (13) and the upper 

part of the fork means (10); 
when in its locking position, said transverse bar (13) lying 
substantially within the plane defined by the two lateral legs 

(12); 
 
characterised by comprising cap pieces (30), each having a 

longitudinal cavity (31) into which a respective lateral leg (12) 
is insertion-fitted, to reduce the useful width of the fork (10) 

and/or increase the length of the lateral legs (12); extension 
pieces (35) to be fixed to the two ends of the transverse bar (13) 

to correspondingly lengthen said bar (13), the extension pieces 
(35) being positioned a short distance from and facing the inner 

lateral faces of the lateral legs (12) or of the cap pieces (30) 
applied to these, when the transverse bar (13) is in its locking 

position; 
said extension pieces (35) being applied as an alternative to 

those cap pieces (30) used for reducing the useful width of the 
fork 10. 
A device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the 
longitudinal cavity (31) of the cap pieces (30) is displaced 

sideways in the transverse direction from the cap piece axis such 
that when the cap pieces (30) are arranged with their lateral face 

(32), namely that more distant from the longitudinal cavity (31), 
facing the interior of the fork (10), the useful width of the fork 

(10) is reduced. 
A device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the 
 

cap pieces (30) have a lower portion which extends below the 
lateral legs (12) to which they are applied, such that it comes 

substantially into contact with the floor (6) when the antitheft 
device is applied to the levers (7). 
A device as claimed in claim 3, characterised in that said 
lower portion of the cap pieces (30) does not comprise the 

longitudinal cavity (31). 
A device as claimed in claim 3, characterised in that the 
cap pieces (30) surround the entire length of the lateral legs 

(12) and have their upper end abutting against the upper 
transverse element (11). 
A device as claimed in the preceding claims, characterised 
in that the cap pieces (30) are of synthetic resin or elastomeric 

material, steel tubular elements (34) being provided to surround 
the cap pieces (30). 
A device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that each 
extension piece (35) comprises: 

a first element (351) of relatively soft and deformable material, 
having a blind cav
ity (351') extending along only part of the 
length of the element (351), to receive one end of the bar 13 by 

slightly forced insertion; 
a hollow second element (352) of hard material steel such as 

steel, mounted over the element (351) by slight forcing and 
comprising at its outer end a projection (352') which abuts 

against the end of the first element (351). 
A device as claimed in claim 1, of the type in which said 
fork means (10) is fixed to the lower end of a handle (16), 

characterised by comprising a rod (40) constrained via its lower 
portion to the handle (16), said rod (40) also comprising second 

hooking means (43) at its upper end and arranged to hook the 
vehicle steering wheel (5). 
A device as claimed in claim 8, characterised in that the 
lower portion of the rod (40) is rectilinear and, when the rod 

(40) is hooked to the steering wheel (5), it is inserted as an 
exact fit, and movable only in the axial direction, through a 

holed member (48) joined to the handle (16) and projecting 
therefrom.
