<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is a system of integrated, computer-based processes for monolingual information development and multilingual translation. An interactive text editor (140) enforces lexical and grammatical constraints on a natural language subset used by the authors (160) to create their text, which they help disambiguate to ensure translatability. The resulting translatable source language text undergoes machine translation into any one of a set of target languages, without the translated text requiring any postediting.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to computer-based
document creation and translation system and,
more particularly, to a system for authoring and
translating constrained-language text to a foreign
language with no pre- or post-editing required.Every organization whose activities require the
generation of vast quantities of information in a
variety of documents is confronted with the need to
ensure their full intelligibility. Ideally, such
documents should be authored in simple, direct
language featuring all necessary expressive attributes
to optimize communication. This language should be
consistent so that the organization is identified
through its single, stable voice. This language
should be unambiguous.The pursuit of this kind of writing excellence has led
to the implementation of various disciplines designed
to bring the authoring process under control. Yet
authors of varied capabilities and backgrounds cannot
comfortably be made to fit a uniform skill standard.
Writing guidelines, rules and standards are elusive --difficult
to define and enforce. Efforts aimed at
both standardizing and improving on the quality of
writing tend to meet with mixed results. However
achieved and however successful, these results push up
documentation authoring costs. Recent attempts at surrounding authors with the
software environment that might enhance their
productivity and the quality of their writing have
only succeeded in providing spell checkers. The
effectiveness of other writing software has so far
been disappointingly weak.When the need to deliver information calls for the
crossing of linguistic frontiers, the challenges
multiply. The organization that needs to clear a
channel for its information flow finds itself to a
great extent, if not totally, dependent on
translation.Translation of text from one language to another
language has been done for hundreds of years. Prior
to the advent of computers, such translation was done
completely manually by experts, called translators,
who were fluent in the language of the original text
(source text) and in the language of the translated
text (target text). Typically, it was preferable for
the translator to have originally learned the target
language as his/her native tongue and subsequently
have learned the source language. Such an approach
was felt to result in the most accurate and efficient
translation.Even the most expert translator must take a
considerable amount of time to translate a page of
text. For example, it is estimated that an expert
translator
