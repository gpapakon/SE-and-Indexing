<ABSTRACT>
Fluorinated carboxylic acids can be recovered from materials which contain them by if necessary liberating the carboxylic acids with sufficiently strong acids, esterifying the liberated acids and distilling off the esters. Advantageously, the esters can be hydrolysed immediately with aqueous ammonia solution to give the corresponding ammonium salts.

<CLAIMS>
A process for the recovery of fluorinated carboxylic 
acids in utilizable form from contaminated starting 

materials, which comprises releasing, if necessary, 
the fluorinated carboxylic acid from these materials 

in an aqueous medium with a sufficiently strong acid, 
reacting this fluorinated carboxylic acid with a 

suitable alcohol and distilling off the ester formed. 
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the starting 
material contains perfluorooctanoic acid or a 

salt thereof. 
The process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the 
starting material contains the fluorinated carboxylic 

acid as ammonium salt or sodium salt. 
The process as claimed in one or more of the preceding 
claims, wherein the starting material is a polymerization 

liquor. 
The process as claimed in one or more of the preceding 
claims, wherein the alcohol is methanol. 
The process as claimed in one or more of the preceding 
claims, wherein the sufficiently strong acid is 

sulfuric acid. 
The process as claimed in one or more of the preceding 
claims, wherein the ester formed is hydrolyzed 

with aqueous ammonia solution to give the ammonium 
salt of the fluorinated carboxylic acid.
