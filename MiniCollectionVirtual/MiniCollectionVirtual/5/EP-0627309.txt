Process for adjusting the contact between two rollers 
(1, 2), whose spacing can be adjusted, of a printing 

unit of a rotary printing machine, characterised in 
that a piezo foil of known thickness is introduced into 

the roll gap on one side of the rollers (1, 2) while 
they are out of contact, the rollers (1, 2) are 

adjusted on this side with respect to each other until 
the piezo foil emits an output signal on the first 

contact with the two rollers (1, 2), the piezo foil is 
taken out of the roll gap and the procedure is repeated 

on the other side of the rollers (1, 2), and finally 
the rollers (1, 2) on both sides are moved towards each 

other by the amount of thickness of the piezo foil.
