<ABSTRACT>
In order to manufacture the rotor of a rotating electrical commutator, a blank (preform) (10) of the slip rings is produced, made of an electrically conducting material, by stacking pieces (16), which have an L-shaped cross-section, so as to form an outer tubular part (14) and parts (12) forming rings, projecting radially on the inside of the tubular part. The blank (10) is held between two plates (22) and partially filled with liquid resin (28). The resin is then centrifuged and cured by application of a heat cycle. Finally, the outer tubular part (14) is removed by machining.

Process for manufacturing a rotor (44) of a 
rotating electrical commutator, comprising the following 

steps: 

formation of a preform (10) of slip rings, made of 
an electrically conductive material, including an outer 

tubular part (14) devoid of perforation and ring-forming 
parts (12) spaced apart from each other and projecting 

radially inwards from the said tubular part; 
partial closure of a space (24) internal to the 
said preform, at least in a peripheral region of this 

space; 
introduction of a liquid resin (28) into the said 
space; 
centrifuging of the resin by rotating the preform 
and simultaneously applying a thermal cycle for curing 

the resin, so as to form a rigid annular block (43); and 
removal of the said outer tubular part (14). 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the said preform (10) is formed by stacking several 

pieces (16), each including a section of the said outer 
tubular part (14) and one of the ring-forming parts (12). 
Process according to Claim 2, characterized in that 
pieces (16) are used which have substantially, in cross-section, 

the shape of an L, the two branches of which 
constitute respectively the said section and the said 

ring-forming part (12). 
Process according to either of Claims 2 and 3, 
characterized in that pieces (16) are used which include 

complementary end faces ensuring that when they are  
 

stacked in order to form the said preform (10) they are 
self-centring. 
Process according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the space internal to the 

preform (10) is partially closed by placing the latter 
between two plates (22), at least one of which has a hole 

(26) for introducing the liquid resin (28). 
Process according to Claim 5, characterized in that 
plates (22) are used whose faces turned towards the 

preform (10) are complementary with the end faces of this 
preform so as to ensure that the preform self-centres 

between the plates. 
Process according to either of Claims 5 and 6, 
characterized in that the resin (28) is centrifuged by 

fixing the plates (22) to a shaft (30) which is rotated 
at a substantially constant speed. 
Process according to Claim 7, characterized in that 
the thermal cycle for curing the resin is applied by 

placing an assembly comprising the preform (10), the 
plates (22) and the shaft (30) in a controlled-atmosphere 

chamber (42). 
Process according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the outer tubular part (14) 

is removed by machining. 
Process according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that, before partially closing 

the space (24) internal to the preform (10), an 
electrical conductor (20) is 
soldered to the inside of 
each of the ring-forming parts (12).
