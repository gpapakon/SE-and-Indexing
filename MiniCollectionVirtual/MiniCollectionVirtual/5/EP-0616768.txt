<ABSTRACT>
A filter for an aquarium apparatus includes a 
filter tank casing (13B), a filter unit accommodated in 

the filter tank casing for filtering water from a tank (1) 
and returning filtered water thereto, a water pool section 

(31p) for collecting water from the tank and supplying 
water overflowing therefrom directly to a filter material 

(33) of the filter unit. The filter unit physically and 
biologically filters water from the tank and returns 

filtered water thereto.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a filter for an
aquarium apparatus for keeping and displaying tropical
fish or the like.An aquarium apparatus consists of a tank, a lid,
an illuminator, a filter, etc.Of these components, the filter serves to
physically and biologically filter out contaminants from
the water contained in the tank.The filter and illuminator are designed to
constitute a lid covering the open top of the tank.In the filter, water pumped from the tank with a
pump mechanism is showered from a shower pipe or a trough
onto a filter material provided in a filter unit
accommodated in a filter tank casing.The filter unit is configured to concurrently
perform physical filtering for filtering out floating
particles in the water using chemical fibers or other such
filter material and biological filtering for filtering out
organic substances dissolved in the water using bacteria
living in a filter material such as gravel.In the prior art filter for the aquarium
apparatus, water is supplied to a filter unit by
showering. This has the advantage of increasing the
amount of dissolved oxygen available to the fish or the
like in the aquarium tank.However, showering also has the effect of 
reducing the amount of dissolved carbon dioxide available
to aquatic plants in the aquarium tank.This method of supplying water is therefore
inappropriate for the filter of an aquarium apparatus used
mainly to display aquatic plants.It is desirable to preclude the above inconvenience
by providing a filter for an aquarium apparatus which can
be used irrespective of whether the apparatus is used to
display fish or aquatic plants.US 5 108 594 discloses an aquarium trickle filter
for filtering aquarium water. The filter includes a
removable drip tray which covers a chamber containing
filter material and which has grooves for uniformly
dispersing incoming water over the filter material. Some
showering effect is likely to occur as water leaves the
drip tray although this will not be great due to the
configuration of the drip tray.An object of the present invention is to alleviate
at least some of the problems of the prior art.According to the present invention, there is
provided a filter for an aquarium apparatus, adapted to
filter with a filter material water pumped from a tank
with a pump and return the filtered water into the tank,
comprising a filter casing that accommodates the filter
material therein and has an upstream side water
pooling section for collecting water pumped from the tank
and downstream side water discharge ports,

<CLAIMS>
A filter for an aquarium apparatus, adapted to
filter with a filter material (33) water pumped from a

tank (1) with a pump (20) and return the filtered water
into the tank, comprising a filter casing (13B) that

accommodates the filter material (33) therein and has an
upstream side water pooling section (31p) for collecting

water pumped from the tank and downstream side water
discharge ports (31ha, 31hb), and a trough (34)

detachably attached to the filter casing (31),
characterised in that the trough (34) is provided with

a plurality of pairs of upstream side projections (34i)
and downstream side holes (34h) or pairs of downstream

side projections (34i) and upstream side holes (34h) for
supplying water from the water pooling section (31p) to

the filter material (33) provided inside the filter
casing (31).
