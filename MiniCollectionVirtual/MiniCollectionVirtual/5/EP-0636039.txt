<ABSTRACT>
A steering device, such as for use in a guidewire for percutaneous transluminal insertion into the coronary vascular system is provided. The guidewire (180) comprises an elongate flexible housing (182) having proximal and distal ends and at least one lumen extending through the length of the housing. The guidewire has a steering element (202) secured within the lumen and adapted to displace the distal end (184) of the housing in a lateral direction. At least one deflection wire (188) extends through the flexible housing extending from a distal point of attachment to the proximal end. Axial movement of the deflection wire displaces a distal steering region of the housing in a lateral direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
 STEERΆBLE MEDICAL DEVICEBackground of the Invention The present invention relates to steering devices such as may be used with catheters, cannulae, guidewires and the like. More particularly, the present invention relates to catheters and guidewires that are steerable through body lumen or cavities and positionable within or aimable at obstructions, organs or tissue within the body from a position external to the body. Medical catheters generally comprise elongate tube-like members which may be inserted into the body, either percutaneously or via a body orifice, for any of a wide• variety of diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Such medical applications frequently require use of a catheter having the ability to negotiate twists and turns, particularly with regard to certain cardiovascular applications.One such application, "Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty" (balloon angioplasty) , requires manipulation of a catheter from a position outside the patient's body through extended portions of the patient's arterial system to the stenotic site for the purpose of alleviating the obstruction by inflating a balloon. This particular procedure has been performed with increasing frequency over the past years in preference to open heart bypass surgery, when possible. In a typical angioplasty procedure, a guidewire is transluminally inserted into the brachial or the femoral artery, to be positioned within the stenotic region and followed by a balloon catheter. The cardiologist usually pre¬ bends the distal tip of the guidewire before insertion and then rotates (or torques) the wire once it has reached a branch artery to enable the guidewire to enter the branch. If the angle of the bend has to be adjusted, the guidewire must be removed, re-bent and reinserted, sometimes several times. Particular difficulty is encountered with prebending where an artery branches at one angle, and then sub-branches at a different angle. This procedure is attended by the risk of significant trauma to the arterial lining, and, in many cases, 

the obstruction cannot be reached at all with the guidewire and catheter.Coronary arteries are tortuous, have many sub-branches and often the obstruction is either located where the diameter of the artery is small or, by its very presence, the obstruction leaves only a very small opening through which a guidewire and/or catheter can be passed. Consequently, the cardiologist often finds it very difficult to maneuver the guidewire or catheter, which are typically several feet long, from

WE CLAIM :
1. A steerable device for percutaneous transluminal insertion into the coronary or peripheral vascular system and controlled negotiation of branches and turns therein, said device comprising: an elongate support structure having a proximal and a distal end for transmitting axial force from the proximal end of the support structure to the distal end thereof; a steering element extending distally from the distal end of the support structure; a fulcrum at the intersection of the support structure and the steering element; and a core wire extending generally parallel to the support structure and secured to the steering element at a point of attachment which is distai from the fulcrum; wherein axial movement of the core wire in a proximal direction relative to the support structure causes a lateral deflecting of the steering element distally of the fulcrum.
2. A steerable device as in Claim 1, wherein at least a portion of the support structure comprises solid walled tubing.
3. A steerable device as in Claim 1, wherein at least a portion of the support structure comprises a spring coil.
4. A steerable device as in Claim 3, wherein adjacent loops of the spring coil are normally in contact with each other.
5. A steerable device as in Claim l, wherein the core wire is rotationally linked to the support structure by at least one torque transmitter.
6. A steerable device as in Claim 5, comprising at least two torque transmitters.
7. A steerable device as in Claim 1, further comprising a spring coil surrounding the steering element.
8. A steerable device as in Claim 1, wherein the fulcrum is disposed within about 10 mm from the distal end of 


the steerable device.
9. A steerable device as in Claim 8, wherein the fulcrum is disposed within about 6 mm from the distal end of the steerable device. 10. A steerable device as in Claim 1, wherein the support structure comprises an elongate tubular body, the steering element is axially immovably secured to the distal end of the support structure, and is relatively laterally flexible compared to the support structure so that proximal axial displacement of the core wire preferentially causes the steering element to bend laterally.
11. A steerable device as in Claim 10, wherein the tubular body extends distally beyond the fulcrum to enclose the steering element. 12. A steerable device as in Claim 1, wherein the fulcrum comprises a solder joint between the support structure and the steering element.
13. A steerable device as in Claim 1, wherein the fulcrum comprises a transition between a proximal portion of the support structure which is relatively laterally inflexible, and a distal steering element portion which is relatively laterally flexible.
14. A steerable device as in Claim 1, wherein the fulcrum comprises a transition between a proximal portion of the support structure which is relatively axially noncompressible and a distal steering element portion which is relatively laterally flexible.
