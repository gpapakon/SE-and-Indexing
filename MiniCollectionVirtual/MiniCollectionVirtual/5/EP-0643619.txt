<ABSTRACT>
Precise control of pyrocarbon being coated upon an object in a fluidized particle bed is achieved by monitoring the pressure difference between a region above the bed and a region in the lower portion of or just below the bed. Measurement of such pressure differential has been found to be truly representative of bed size in such a coater, and bed size is recognized to be a most important factor in achieving the desired characteristics of the substance being deposited. By adjusting bed size in response to changes in the pressure difference being monitored, a substantially constant bed size is readily achieved; alternatively, the pressure difference can be caused to gradually change in accord with a predetermined program. In either instance, adjustments are effected by adding additional particles to the bed or by changing the rate at which particles are withdrawn, and precise coating characteristics, e.g. thicknesses within very close tolerances, are achievable.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application relates to the deposition of 
a substance, such as pyrolytic carbon, onto a substrate 
being levitated in a fluidized bed of particles, and it 
more specifically relates to methods and apparatus for 
very carefully controlling pyrolytic deposition, 
particularly in instances where the density of the 
substance being deposited is less than the density of 
the particles that make up the particulate bed that is 
being levitated. Pyrolytic carbon or pyrocarbon has long been 
deposited by the thermal decomposition of a gaseous or 
vaporized hydrocarbon, or some other carbonaceous 
substance in vaporous form, in the presence of a 
substrate on which the deposition occurs. It has also 
been known for a number of years that the character of 
the pyrocarbon deposited is highly influenced by the 
amount of surface area available for deposition within 
a fluidized bed of a certain unit volume and that 
accordingly the characteristics of the pyrocarbon 
actually deposited can be desirably influenced by 
careful control of the bed size, as generally taught in 
U.S. Patent No. 3,399,969 to Bokros, et al. This 
patent points out that the pyrocarbon coating of 
relatively large objects, such as objects having a 
dimension of about 5 millimeters or greater, in the 
presence of an ancillary bed of small particles (i.e.  
 
of a size measured in tens or hundreds of microns), is 
best controlled by controlling the available deposition 
surface area relative to the volume of the coating 
enclosure wherein the actual deposition is taking 
place. In U.S. Patent No. 3,977,896 to Bokros and 
Akins, an improved process was described and 
illustrated for depositing pyrolytic carbon coatings of 
substantial thickness which would have a very uniform 
crystallinity throughout the entire thickness of the 
pyrocarbon deposited. Such uniformity was achieved by 
maintaining the total deposition surface area within 
the coating enclosure relatively constant by adding 
particles of small size to the coater while coated 
particles (which have grown in size) are being removed 
from the enclosure at a controlled rate by regulating 
the rate of flow of an inert gas stream upward through 
a conduit through which the particles exit. Subsequent to the issuance of the '896 
patent, U.S. Patent No. 4,546,012 issued in the name of 
Brooks which discloses an improved fluidized bed 
apparatus for coating such relatively large objects in 
association with a bed of particles being levitated, 
wherein a constant bed size is maintained
