<ABSTRACT>
A toner for developing an electrostatic image 
is formed of toner particles; wherein each toner 

particle includes (i) 100 wt. parts of a binder resin 
having a glass transition point (Tg) of 50 - 70 
o
C, 
(ii) 0.2 - 20 wt. parts of solid wax, and (iii) 

colorant particles or magnetic powder carrying a 
liquid lubricant, so that the toner particle retains 

at its surface the liquid lubricant gradually released 
from the particles (iii). The toner may be further 

blended with an organically treated inorganic fine 
powder to provide a developer. The toner or 

developer retains good lubricity and releasability so 
that it is suitable to be used in an image forming 

method including means contacting a latent image-bearing 
means, such as a contact charging means, a 

contact transfer means or a contact cleaning means.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a toner and 
a developer for developing electrostatic images used 
in image forming methods, such as electrophotography, 
electrostatic recording and magnetic recording, a 
process for production thereof, and an image forming 
method. Hitherto, a large number of electrophotographic 
processes have been known, inclusive of those 
disclosed in U.S. Patents Nos. 2,297,691; 3,666,363; 
and 4,071,361. In these processes, in general, an 
electrostatic latent image is formed on a 
photosensitive member comprising a photoconductive 
material by various means, then the latent image is 
developed with a toner, and the resultant toner image 
is, after being transferred onto a transfer material 
such as paper, as desired, fixed by heating, pressing, 
or heating and pressing, or with solvent vapor to 
obtain a copy. The residual toner on the 
photosensitive member without being transferred is 
cleaned as desired by various methods, and then the 
above steps are repeated. Accordingly, it has been required to provide  
 
a toner excellent in releasability, lubricity, and 
transferability. For this reason, toners containing a 
silicone compound have been disclosed in Japanese 
Patent Publication (JP-B) 57-13868, Japanese Laid-Open 
Patent Application (JP-A) 54-48245, JP-A 59-197048, 
JP-A 2-3073, JP-A 3-63660, U.S. Patent No. 4,517,272, 
etc. However, in such a toner containing a silicone 
compound directly added thereto, a silicone compound 
lacking mutual solubility with the binder resin shows 
a poor dispersibility and cannot be uniformly 
contained in individual toner particles, thus being 
liable to result in a fluctuation in chargeability of 
toner particles and a toner showing an inferior 
developing performance in a continuous use. A corona discharger has been generally widely 
used in a printer or a copying machine utilizing 
electrophotography, as a means for uniformly charging 
the surface of a photosensitive member (electrostatic 
image-bearing member) or a means for transferring a 
toner image on a photosensitive member. On the other 
hand, a contact charging or transferring method of 
causing a contact charging member to contact or be 
pressed against a photosensitive member surface while 
externally applying a voltage has been developed and 
commercialized. Such a contact charging method or a contact 
transfer method has been proposed in, e.g., JP-A 63-149669  
 
and JP-A 2-123385. In such a method, an 
electroconductive elastic roller is abutted against an 
electrostatic
