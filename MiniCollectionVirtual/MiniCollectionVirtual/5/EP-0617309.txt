<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an active matrix panel.A conventional active matrix liquid crystal panel
as disclosed in "SID-83 digest pp. 156 - 157, B/W and
colour LC video displays addressed by polysilicon TFTs"
(Morozumi et al) is illustrated in Figure 19. Such an
active matrix panel 1 comprises a picture element matrix
2, which utilises thin film transistors and which is
formed on a transparent substrate. Gate line drive
circuits and source line drive circuits 4, in the form
of MOS integrated circuits composed of mono-crystal
silicon, are attached to the edges of the active matrix
panel 1 as shown, each drive circuit 4 being mounted on
a respective flexible substrate 3 and being connected to
the picture element matrix 2 of the active matrix panel
1 at pads 5. A mounting substrate 6 provides both
mechanical support for the flexible substrates 3 and the
active matrix panel 1 and electrical connection between
the drive circuits 4 and external circuitry (not shown).This conventional arrangement has the following
disadvantages:In the prior art, each source or gate line of the
active matrix panel 1 is connected to the associated
drive circuit 4 at a respective pad 5 so that close
positioning of the picture elements is limited by the
pad interval required for forming the connections during
mounting. Therefore, mass production of the active
matrix panel with a picture element spacing of 100
microns or less is very difficult and so high resolution
cannot be obtained. In the conventional arrangement shown in Figure
19, each drive circuit 4 is mounted outside the active
matrix panel 1 so that the external dimensions of the
mounting substrate 6 have to be a fourth or fifth as
large again as the dimensions of the picture element
matrix 2. Therefore, the dimensions of the display
device employing the active matrix panel 1 must
inevitably be larger than the dimensions of the picture
element matrix 2, which is the portion contributing to
the display, and this limits the application of the
active matrix panel in a micro-monitor, such as a view
finder for a video camera.The production of a display device employing the
arrangement shown in Figure 19 involves the process of
connecting the flexible substrates 3 with the active
matrix panel 1, the process of connecting the drive
circuits 4 with the flexible substrates 3, and the
process of mounting the flexible substrates 3 and the
active matrix panel 1 on the mounting substrate 6,
which renders production expensive.Due to the many connections, for example between
the active
