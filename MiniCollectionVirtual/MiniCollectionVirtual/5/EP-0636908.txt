<ABSTRACT>
A wavelength-division-multiplexed transmitter 
has a single modulator modulating the output of an array 

of individually actuable semiconductor lasers (LA1,...,LA8) integrated 
onto the same substrate as the modulator. An optical 

combiner (CO1) integrated onto the same substrate between each 
of the lasers and the single modulator combines the 

outputs of the lasers. One or more of the lasers are 
activated as desired for wavelength division multiplexing. 
The modulator (MOD1) is a directional coupler modulator, a 
Mach-Zehnder modulator, or any other suitable optical modulator. The 

lasers (LA1 to LA8) are distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) lasers or 
distributed feedback (DFB) lasers. They may be any other form of optical 

laser having a controlled emission wavelength. 
The combiner (CO1) is in the form of a slab waveguide region without 
lateral confinement of the light to allow diffraction in the plane of 

the wafer. Each waveguide (W1 to W8) entering the free-space region on 
the input sided has a far field that illuminates the output waveguide 

(OW1) on the output side. With one output waveguide, this device is a 1 
× 8 power combiner. In a more general form such combiners have more than 

one output. With N inputs and N outputs the combiner makes an N × N star 
coupler. In an embodiment of the invention, the combiner (CO1) takes the 

form of an N × N star coupler and uses only one of the output 
waveguides.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to optical
communications, and particularly to wavelength-division
multiplexing (WDM) transmitters.The use of wavelength division multiplexing
affords one the opportunity of raising the transmission
capacity of a single fiber without the need to develop
higher speed components. In switching or networking
environments, wavelength division multiplexing
arrangements permits optical routing of signals at
different wavelengths to different destinations.Optical sources used in wavelength division
multiplexed communications systems must generate light at
controlled wavelengths. They require means either to set
them permanently to a desired wavelength allocated to a
particular channel, or to switch them dynamically to
different specific wavelengths for routing purposes. In
general, the sources must restrict the wavelengths to
prescribed spaced values so that signals do not interfere
with each other. Such interference may result from the
nonlinear transmission properties of the fiber itself, or
from source wavelength drift and insufficient out-off band
rejection in the optical filtering or heterodyning
technology used to demultiplex the signals at the
receiver.Discrete fixed-frequency sources have been used
in wavelength division multiplexing demonstrations.
However, using such systems on a commercial basis requires 
the storage and maintenance of large numbers of reserve
sources such as distributed feedback (DFB) lasers.
Tunable lasers that attempt to cover the entire range of
desired wavelengths have hitherto required cumbersome
feedback from external references to provide reliable
wavelength stability and often have had insufficient
tuning range for many applications.The paper "A 16 x 1 WDM Transmitter with
Integrated DBR Lasers and Electroabsorption Modulators" by
M.G. Young et al, paper No. IWA3 in Tech. Digest of 1993
Topical Meeting on Integrated Photonics Research, pp. 414-417,
held in Palm Springs, 1993, discloses the use of an
array of sixteen independent distributed Bragg reflector
(DBR) lasers, each with an integrated electroabsorption
modulator, followed by a combiner and an integrated
optical booster amplifier, to provide a single fiber port
for all 16 wavelength division multiplexed channels. It
requires a modulator for each laser. Such an approach
demands complex electrical packaging because the
arrangement requires a separate high-speed electrical
drive capability for each source, either to modulate each
laser directly, or to drive each electroabsorption
modulator for each
