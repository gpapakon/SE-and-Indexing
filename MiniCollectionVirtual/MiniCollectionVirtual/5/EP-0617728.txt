<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns two-component compositions which can be cross-linked at room temperature and pressure and which are based on liquid polymers containing acid-anhydride groups and on sterically hindered aromatic di- or polyamines. These compositions are characterized by their low toxicity and controllable cross-linking behaviour. The cross-linked products have high mechanical strength, high thermal stability and high stability to hydrolysis. The invention also concerns methods of preparing such compositions and their use as coating compounds, casting compounds, sealing compounds and adhesives.
