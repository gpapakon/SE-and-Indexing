<ABSTRACT>
A hydraulic control system comprising a hydraulic 
actuator (20, 92) having opposed openings (A, B) adapted to 

alternately function as inlets and outlets for moving the ele足
ment (21) of the actuator (20,92) in opposite directions, a 

pump (22) for supplying fluid to said actuator (20; 92), pilot 
operated meter-in valve means (27; 91) to which the fluid from 

the pump is supplied for controlling the direction of move足
ment of the actuator (20), pilot operated meter-out valve 

means (34, 35; 91) associated with each opening (A, B) of the 
actuator (20, 92) for controlling the flow out of said actuator 

(20), and means (85, 87, 89; 86, 88, 90; 95, 97; 96, 98) for 
sensing a predetermined drop in a line (33; 32; 93; 94) supply足

ing fluid to one opening (B; A) of the actuator (20; 92) caused 
by a runaway load in one direction and operating the meter-足

out valve means (34; 35; 91) to interrupt flow out of the other 
opening (A; B) of the actuator (20, 92).
