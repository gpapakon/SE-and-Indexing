<ABSTRACT>
A process for the removal of phosphorous, in the form of orthophosphate, from an aqueous stream comprising the introduction into the stream of an effective amount of calcium ions, preferably gypsum derived, adjusting the pH to between about 5 and 8, introducing the stream into a reaction vessel wherein it is brought into contact with a gently stirred bed of fine particulate magnesia in an amount sufficient to fix the so-formed calcium phosphate, the pH of the stream in contact with the magnesia being from about 8 to 12 and removing a stream from the vessel which is depleted in phosphorous.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PROCESS FOR THE REMOVAL OF PHOSPHOROUS Field of the InventionThis invention relates to processes for removal of phosphorous from aqueous streams, and in particular to a process whereby the phosphorous is present as orthophosphate and is removed by adsorption onto hydrated magnesium oxide in the form of calcium salts. Background to the InventionThe presence of phosphorous in aqueous streams which enter the environment has been recognised as undesirable due to the role of this element in lake and river eutrophication. Although appreciable amounts of phosphorous may enter water courses through groundwater which has leached phosphorous from the surrounding soils (particularly in agricultural areas fertilised with phosphorous containing chemicals), significant quantities of phosphorous enter the aquatic environment from sewage and industrial effluent streams. In the Hawkesbury/Nepean River system near Sydney Australia for example, it has been estimated that from 1/3 to 1/2 of the ambient dissolved phosphorous originates from sewage.The problems of excessive phosphorous in water courses has been recognised for some time, and the prior art is replete with methods which seek to address the problem. The aim of these processes has been to produce an aqueous effluent sufficiently depleted in phosphorous such that its quality complies with relevant environmental legislation.One general approach to phosphorous removal has been to treat the phosphorous containing stream with metal salts, thus forming an insoluble metal phosphorous which is removed from the stream through sedimentation or other means. Some examples of this method include the use of aluminium or ferric salts, and also of lime. In this process insoluble phosphates of aluminium, iron or 

calcium are formed.While these methods have proved reasonably successful in meeting existing regulatory standards, as environmental requirements on the phosphorous effluent streams become more stringent, it is unlikely that they will perform to the revised standards without significantly increasing the dose rates, and/or very substantial engineering upgrade of existing sewage treatment plants. An indication of the measures required to consistently lower sewage effluent phosphorous levels to 0.15mg/L using iron salts can be gained from the paper of D M Philp J. Wat. Poll. Cont. Fed. 57(8) 1984, pp 841-846 which describes phosphorous removal at a large sewage works near Canberra, Australia. Plant upgrades to utilise metal salts will entail modest capital costs as well as

CLAIMS
1. A process for the removal of phosphorous, in the form of orthophosphate, from an aqueous system, comprising introducing into the stream an effective amount of calcium ions, optionally decarbonating the stream prior to the introduction of the calcium, adjusting the pH to between about 5 and 8, introducing the stream into a reaction vessel, contacting the stream with an amount of magnesium oxide in the form of fine particles sufficient to fix the so-formed calcium phosphate, the pH of the stream in contact with the magnesium oxide being from about 8 to 12, whilst agitating the magnesium oxide and removing a stream from the vessel which is depleted in phosphorous.
2. A process as in claim 1, wherein the stream is introduced into the reaction vessel in a manner such that it flows upwardly.
3. A process as in claim 1 or claim 2, wherein calcium is provided to the stream by a bed of gypsum disposed in a lower portion of the reaction vessel. 4. A process as in claim 1, wherein the calcium-containing liquid stream is introduced into a reaction vessel containing a continuously stirred slurry of magnesia which, when appropriately loaded with phosphorous, is allowed to overflow into a settling or thickening apparatus, to form a thickened phosphorous laden slurry which is returned to the reaction vessel, and a phosphorous depleted liquid stream.
5. A process as in any one of claims 1. to 4, wherein the calcium is in the form of a soluble salt, preferably gypsum or calcium chloride.
6. A process as in any one of claims 1 to 5, wherein the calcium ions are introduced into the stream by diverting a portion thereof to a tank, adding the calcium to the stream contained therein and returning the calcium-dosed stream to the stream to be introduced into the reaction vessel. 


 7. A process as in any one of claims 1 to 6, wherein the liquid stream is decarbonated prior to the introduction of calcium ions.
8. A process as in claim 7, wherein decarbonation is achieved by adding sufficient acid to the liquid stream contained in a vessel so as to lower the pH to about 4-4.5 and air stripping the stream.
9. A process as in claim 8, wherein alkali is added to the decarbonated stream to give a pH of about 5-8. 10. A process as in any one of claims 1 to 9, wherein the contents of the reaction vessel are agitated in a manner to just prevent the formation of channels in the bed of magnesium oxide.
11. A process as in any one of claims 1 to 10, wherein the magnesium oxide has a particle size of less than about 200 microns.
12. A process as in claim 11, wherein the magnesium oxide has a particle size of less than about 100 micron.
13. A process as in claim 12, wherein the particle size distribution of the magnesia is such that 95% by weight passes a 75 micron screen.
14. A process as in claim 13, wherein the magnesia has a mean particle diameter of about 10 micron.
15. A process as in any one of claims 1 to 14, wherein the magnesium oxide is in the form of magnesia.
16. A process as in any one of claims 1 to 15, wherein the phosphorous depleted stream is subjected to filtration and flocculation.
17. A process as in claim 16, wherein flocculation is achieved through the addition of an anionic polymer to the phosphorous depleted liquid stream.
18. A process as in any one of claims 1 to 17, wherein magnesium oxide or magnesia loaded with phosphorous is removed and dewatered with the liquid component being returned to the reaction vessel and the solid component 


removed for use as a fertiliser.
19. A process as in any one of claims 1 to 18, wherein the pH of the liquid stream prior to calcium addition is about 5-7. 20. A process as in any one of claims 1 to 19, wherein the pH of the contents of the reaction vessel is about 9-11.
21. A process as in claim 4, wherein the reaction vessel comprises an in-line mixer. 22. A process as in any one of claims 1 to 21, wherein the phosphorous containing aqueous stream is primary, secondary or tertiary sewage.
23. A process as in any one of claims 1 to 22, wherein the amount of calcium ions introduced to the liquid stream to reduce phosphorous in the phosphorous depleted stream to (0.2mg/L is sufficient to give a concentration ) or =
