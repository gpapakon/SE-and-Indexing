<ABSTRACT>
The soft foam layer, pref. of polyurethane, is a soft foam layer (10) to bond external tiles of plates to a building wall. Before the tiles (3) are attached to the wall (1), the foam layer is wholly saturated with a thin fluid adhesive mass. The tiles (3) are pressed into place against the wall (1) while the foam layer (10) is still wet. While they are pressed in place, the adhesive dries or sets so that there is adhesion against the wall (1) with an inelastic adhesive mass which retains its shape.

Method of fixing slab or panel-type cladding elements (3) 
with thermal insulation properties to a building wall (1), in 

particular to the exterior of the building wall, wherein the 
cladding elements have on their reverse facing the building wall 

a flexible foam layer (10) firmly bonded to them, which is 
affixed to the building wall, characterized in that, when the 

cladding elements (3) are still separate from the building wall 
(1), their flexible foam layer (10) is impregnated at least 

essentially over its entire volume with a thin-bodied adhesive 
compound, after which the cladding elements (3) are pressed, with 

the flexible foam layer (10) compressed in wet condition, against 
the building wall (1), and the adhesive compound is allowed to 

dry or cure with the flexible foam layer (10) compressed, so that 
the flexible foam layer (10) not only bonds to the building wall 

(1), but also becomes dimensionally stable and inelastic due to 
the cured adhesive compound. 
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that a flame 
retardant is mixed in with the adhesive compound. 
Method according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that an 
aqueous, thin-bodied adhesive compound is used. 
Method according to any of claims 1 to 3, characterized in 
that water glass is used as adhesive compound.
