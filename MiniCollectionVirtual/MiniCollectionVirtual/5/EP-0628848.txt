<ABSTRACT>
An electrochromic device comprises an 
electrochromic electrode, an opposed electrode 

and an electrolyte interposed between these 
electrodes. The electrolyte is made of a thin 

film of a porous polymer having a refractive 
index of 1.48 to 1.56 and it is impregnated with 

ionic conductor dissolved in a solvent: such 
as a mixture of 2,2-diphenylpropionitrile and 

a solvent having a lower refractive index than 
that of the former; a mixture of 1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone 

and a compound having a 
higher refractive index than that of the former; 

or a mixture of DL-2-phenylbutyronitrile and/or 
4-phenylbutyronitrile and a polyalkylene glycol 

or its ether compound. High transmissivity 
and excellent EL characteristics are obtained by 

adjusting the refractive index with the porous 
polymer film.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel 
electrochromic (hereunder abbreviated to EC) device, and 
more specifically, it relates to an electrochromic device 
prepared using a polymeric porous thin-film with low 
light dispersion whose pores are filled with an ionic 
conductor as an electrolyte, which is suitable for use as 
a dimming device or display device. An EC device usually consist of an electrolyte, an 
EC material on a transparent electrode substrate 
(hereinuder abbreviated to "EC layer") and a counter 
electrode. An electrolyte which is situated between an 
EC electrode having a layer composed of an EC layer and a 
counter electrode. When a voltage is applied between the 
electrodes, the color of the EC layer changes. This 
color can be bleached reversibly by changing electric 
polarity. This type of EC device is characterized in that 
large-area display is made possible, operation life is 
long, response speed is high, coloring efficiency is 
high, vivid colors may be outputted, and transmittance is 
high upon decoloring; in recent years this characteristic 
to change color tones has been utilized in display 
devices and dimming devices, the suitable response speed 
has been utilized in anti-glare materials, the memory 
characteristics have been utilized in memory sensors, 
etc. The electrolytes used in this type of EC device may 
be largely classified into liquid electrolytes and solid 
electrolytes, the former having disadvantages in that, 
although liquid electrolytes have a high ionic 
conductivity and thus excellent response, the fact that  
 
they are liquids which means that measures must be taken 
in the construction and assembly of the device to guard 
against leaking, and even when such anti-leaking measures 
are taken, there is still a risk of leaking as a result 
of damage, or during use. In contrast, while common 
solid electrolytes do not have the problems mentioned 
above, their drawback is a poor response duo to their low 
ionic conductivity. Here, the present inventors have carried out 
diligent research to develop a solid electrolyte with a 
high ionic conductivity, and have found that a polymer 
electrolytic thin-film prepared by filling the pores of a 
polymeric porous thin-film with an ionic conductor may be 
basically handled as a solid, with no risk of leaking, 
and thus makes an excellent ionic conductor. If such a polymer electrolytic thin-film is used as 
the electrolyte for an EC device, the thin-film may 
simply be sandwiched between the two electrodes after 
they
