<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a book binding
apparatus according to the preamble of claim 1, and more particularly, it
relates to a book binding apparatus in which imaged
sheets are bookbound as a book and which is applicable
to an on-line system wherein a plurality of image forming
apparatuses required for forming images on sheets
successively, a book binding apparatus for bookbinding
the sheets on which the images were formed and a
sorting and containing apparatus for sorting and
containing the bookbound sheet bundles are
interconnected. The present invention also relates to an image forming
apparatus having such a book binding apparatus.In the past, when a plurality of sheets on which
images were formed are automatically glue-bound to obtain
a book, an on-line system wherein a plurality of
apparatus required for performing such jobs are
interconnected has been used.For example, the on-line system includes (1)
a reading and sheet supplying apparatus comprising an
original setting portion for setting an original, an
optical system for scanning the original, and a sheet
supplying apparatus for containing a number of sheets 
and for supplying the sheet, (2) an image forming
apparatus for forming an image on the sheet supplied
from the sheet supplying apparatus, (3) a book binding
apparatus for bookbinding the sheets on which the
images were formed, and (4) a sheet sorting and
containing apparatus for sorting and containing the
bookbound or finished sheet bundles or the sheets.
These apparatuses are interconnected in series.When the sheet bundle is bookbound in the book
binding apparatus, the sheet bundle aligned in a sheet
align tray is glue-bound by a gluing binder. A bind
tape used with the gluing binder comprises a tape-shaped
sheet on which paste or glue of hot melt type is coated.
The bind tape is abutted against the sheet bundle and
is adhered to the sheet bundle by melting the glue by
a heater.In the conventional book binding apparatus of
the on-line system including the image forming
apparatus, a sheet entrance portion, a sheet bundle
aligning means, a convey means and a stacker are
arranged in series, and the convey means is of handling
type. According to this handling type, in bookbinding
the sheet bundle, the sheets successively entered
from the sheet entrance portion are aligned in the
aligning means as a sheet bundle, and then the bind
tape is abutted against the sheet bundle and is
heated by the heater to bookbind the sheet bundle, 
and the bookbound sheet bundle is contained in the
stack
