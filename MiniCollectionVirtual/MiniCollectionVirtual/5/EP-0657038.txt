<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a lens system suitable for
use as an objective or taking lens for compact photographic cameras
and providing a field coverage of at least 55 degrees and preferably 60
degrees or higher.With the increasing demand for manufacturing smaller,
more compact photographic cameras at a lower cost, there is an
increased need for use of smaller and less costly lens systems. Triplet
or a Tessar-type lens systems are good candidates for such use because
these systems have relatively few lens elements.Triplet-type or triplet derivatives such as Tessar-type
lenses have been used in photographic apparatus for many years.
Moreover, the objectives having a triplet-type lens system with the
diaphragm arranged either in front of the first lens element or behind
the last lens element are also well known, and such lens systems are
disclosed in U.S. 3,910,685, U.S. 4,886,342, U.S. 4,892,398, U.S.
4,676,607, U.S. 3,967,884, U.S. 3,895,857 and U.S. 3,784,287. Such
objectives have an advantage of being compact, having relatively few
lens elements and eliminating the costs of "split" barrels.However, many of these lens systems are assembled in
their optical barrels with spacers such as spacer rings or shims placed
between the optical components. This is disadvantageous because the
spacers may cause tolerance build-up on thicknesses as well as
tolerance build-ups due to spacer wedge. In addition, there is an
increased cost due to extra parts.The need for the spacers or shims can be eliminated when
the elements are made of plastic and mounted as shown in U.S.
4,886,342 and U.S. 3,784,287, but this severely limits the choice of the
optical materials of which the lens elements are made. For example,
certain index ranges and V number materials may be required by the
photographic lens system, in order to enhance its performance, but 
such materials are available in optical grade are glass and not in
plastic.Finally, there is a problem if the edge contact is
established too far from the clear aperture, the lens element diameter
will increase, the lens elements thickness will increase and the
compactness of the overall optical system will be compromised.Thus, there is a growing demand for more compact
photographic cameras and correspondingly, there exists a need to
further improve and simplify the lens system for use in such cameras,
and to lower the cost of making such lens systems by making them less
expensive to assemble while maintaining or improving their imaging
quality.An object of the present
