<ABSTRACT>
To supply the terminating resistors (R) from a power supply (20) with filter choke (21) in the case of a signal line with waveguides and termination at both ends, the inductance (Lx, Ly, Lx', Ly') of the identically designed feed lines (19, 19') is connected in series with the filter choke (21) and a power supply without filter capacitor at the output is used.

Arrangement for a voltage supply for loads (17)
having a high pulsed current requirement, in

particular for waveguide terminations, by a power
supply unit (20) having the following features:


the power supply unit (20) contains a DC
voltage generator which is connected directly

to a first connection of a filter inductor,
the second connection of the filter inductor
(21) is connected to a start of a supply line

(16, 19) having a specific inductance (Lx, Ly);
the end of the supply line is directly
connected to buffer capacitors (18, C) and to

the load (17);
the resonant frequency of the filter inductor
(21) in the power supply unit together with the

capacitance (22) acting at the output of the
power supply unit is considerably higher than

the resonant frequency of the line inductance
(Lx) and the buffer capacitor (18, C) directly

connected to the load.
Arrangement according to Claim 1, in which,
furthermore:


the DC voltage generator is connected to a
controller (24),
whose input for the actual value is connected
via a sensing line (23) to the load.
Arrangement according to Claim 1 or 2, in which
there are two identical loads (17, 17') which are

supplied by supply lines having the same
inductance (Lx, Lx') and the same impedance.
Arrangement according to Claim 3, in which the
power supply unit has only one sensor input

(SENSE), which is connected via a sensing line
(23) to only one of the two loads (17'). 
Arrangement according to Claim 3 or 4, in which an
earth line is designed in the same way as the

supply line.
Use of an arrangement according to one of the
preceding claims, in which the DC voltage

generator is subjected to essentially proportional
control, with the voltage directly at the load as

the actual value, and the output voltage of the DC
voltage generator, due to the control process, can

be temporarily overshot by more than half the
rated voltage.
