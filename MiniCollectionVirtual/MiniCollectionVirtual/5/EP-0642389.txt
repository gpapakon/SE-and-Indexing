<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed to a floating cap or spacer (18) and centrifuge tube assembly (16) which provide adequate resistance to the deforming forces exerted on it. The exterior wall of the tube stem (24) is provided with an annular ridge (34) and the support spacer (18) is provided with an annular groove (36) which mates with the ridge (34) on the tube stem (24) to form an interlocking coupling.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
centrifugation, and particularly to the sample retaining
means used in connection with a centrifuge rotor.The invention of OptiSeal™ centrifuge tubes
(commercialized by Beckman Instruments Inc., U.S.A.) is
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,127,895, entitled "Self-Seal
Centrifuge Tube", assigned to the assignee of the
present invention. OptiSeal™ tubes are thin-walled
vessels which are sealed using plugs under forces
developed by centrifuge operation. The particular
geometry of the OptiSeal™ tube illustrated and described
in the '895 patent has a hemispherical top portion around
the tube stem. Such tubes are primarily designed for use
in vertical tube rotors (in which axis of each tube
cavity is parallel to the rotor spin axis) and near
vertical tube rotors (in which axis of each tube cavity
is at a small oblique angle on the order of 10° to the
rotor spin axis). A support cap or spacer is secured to
a counterbore in the cavity and engages the top of the
tube. The advantages of the spacer are that it supports
against the top portion of the tube and the plug so that
it prevents deformation of the tube top caused by
centrifugally induced hydrostatic pressure and it
provides support to seal the plug to the tube stem
against the internal the hydrostatic pressure.However, while the patented tube and closure
have been found to be effective in maintaining a seal
under high centrifugal forces when applied to a vertical 
tube rotor and near vertical tube rotors, the disclosed support
spacer might not be adequate to prevent deformation of the tube
near the tube stem when applied to fixed angle rotors and
swinging bucket rotors. It has been found that the upper portion
of the tube around the tube stem or opening of the tube may be
deformed in fixed angle rotors (in which each rotor cavity is
inclined at a large angle on the order of 25° to the rotor spin
axis), or buckle the tube in the axial direction in swinging
bucket rotor applications (in which the centrifuge tubes are
pivotally supported on the rotor to allow the axis of the tubes
to swing outwards towards horizontal upon centrifugation). Tube
deformation is more pronounced when there is significant amounts
of air enclosed in the tube, from air either entrained in the
liquid material or left in the tube because the liquid does not
fill it as a result of limitation in the tube filling procedures.A prior art attempt to avoid deformation of centrifuge
containers is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,071,316 to Piemonte et
al. The Piemonte

<CLAIMS>
A centrifuge of the type having a spin axis at an angle to
the axis of tubes supported in a walled cavity for rotation about

the spin axis, comprising,

an axially symmetric tube (16) for holding fluids for
centrifugation in a walled cavity structure, the tube having a

cylindrical body portion (22) tapering to a narrower top portion
(20) having a ridge (34),
a cylindrical self-registering spacer member (18) coaxially
surrounding the external periphery of the top portion of the

tube, the spacer member having an axially inward profile
generally following the profile of the top portion of the tube,

including a groove (36) adapted to receive said ridge, providing
a snap fit therebetween said spacer member having an outward

profile generally following the wall of said cavity structure and
separating the tube from the walled cavity in a floating state

when the centrifuge is at rest but wedging the spacer between the
cavity wall and the tube when the centrifuge is rotating, whereby

the top portion of the tube is supported during centrifugation.
A centrifuge according to claim 1 wherein said profile is
substantially hemispherical in shape.
A centrifuge according to claim 1 wherein said profile is
bell-shaped.
A centrifuge according to any one of claims 1, 2 or 3
wherein said spacer includes an annular flange (40) extending

outwardly away from said top portion.
A centrifuge according to any one of claims 1 to 4 wherein
said spacer has a through portion (38) for allowing a tube stem

to extend therethrough.
A centrifuge according to any one of claims 1 to 5 wherein
said spacer has a recess for receiving a plug (28). 
A centrifuge according to any one of claims 1 to 6 wherein
said spacer has a threaded hole for receiving a threaded tool to

be used for removing the spacer from the rotor cavity.
A centrifuge according to any one of claims 1 to 7 wherein
said ridge is annular.
