<DESCRIPTION>
 METHODS FOR TREATING SϋTURABLE WOUNDS BY USE OF SUTURES AND CYANOACRYLATE ADHESIVESBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the InventionThe present invention is directed to methods for closing and covering suturable wounds under sterile conditions by initially suturing or stapling the wound, and afterwards bonding the area adjacent to the sutures or staples with butyl-2-cyanoacrylate adhesives. The butyl-2-cyanoacrylate formulation to be used is typically stored in sterile dispensers for single use.State of the ArtCyanoacrylate adhesives have been suggested for a variety of adhesive purposes including glues and surgical adhesives. In particular, cyanoacrylate adhesives of formula I:OCH,=C-CORCN wherein R is an alkyl or other suitable substituents are disclosed in U.S. Patents Nos. 3,527,224; 3,591,676; 3,667,472; 3,995,641; 4,035,334; and 4,605,826. Typically, when used as adhesives for living tissues, the R substituent is alkyl of from 2 to 6 carbon atoms and most often is butyl (e.g., n-butyl) .The suggested medical uses for cyanoacrylate adhesives have been limited to surgical environments wherein the cyanoacrylate adhesives are utilized as an 

alternative to sutures and are employed in a sterile environment. See, for example, Halpern, U.S. Patent No. 3,667,472. In surgical environments, the subcutaneous layers are typically joined together with sutures, and the skin itself is joined either with sutures or with the cyanoacrylate adhesive. When the cyanoacrylate adhesive is employed, it is applied to separate sections of soft skin tissue under sterile conditions and the sections are then joined. Under these conditions, the cyanoacrylate adhesive bonds to the skin as well as polymerizes so as to join separate sections of soft tissue together.The art discloses that when the cyanoacrylate adhesives successfully bind the skin, incidences of infection are reduced. However, the art also discloses that the use of cyanoacrylate adhesives as suture replacements can be accompanied by occasional adhesion failure resulting in wound reopening which reguires closure by sutures. See, for example, Mizrahi, et al., "Use of Tissue Adhesives in the Repair of Lacerations in Children", Journal of Pediatric Surgery. Vol. 23, No. 4 (April), pp. 312-313 (1988). Fear of wound reopening apparently is one of the reasons surgeons have been reluctant to use any adhesives including cyanoacrylate based adhesives in place of sutures.This invention is directed to methods for treating suturable wounds by first suturing or stapling the

<CLAIMS>
WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. A method for closing the separated skin sections of a suturable wound which comprises the steps of: (a) cleaning the wound;
(b) suturing or stapling the separated skin sections of the wound so that the sutures or staples are separated from each other by no more than about 1.2 centimeters and no less than about 0.6 centimeter; (c) applying butyl-2-cyanoacrylate adhesive to the opposing and still separated skin sections between the sutures or staples in an amount sufficient so that upon polymerization, the skin sections are joined wherein the application is conducted so that contact of the cyanoacrylate adhesive with the sutures or staples is avoided; and
(d) contacting the adjacent separated skin sections under conditions that permit the adhesive to polymerize so as to join separated skin sections.
2. A method according to Claim 1 wherein said adhesive is applied to said wound in an amount of at least 0.02 ml of butyl-2-cyanoacrylate adhesive per square centimeter of skin which is to be joined.
3. A method according to Claim 1 wherein the butyl-2-cyanoacrylate adhesive has a viscosity of from about 20 to about 100 centipoise at 20°C.
4. The method according to Claim 3 wherein the butyl-2-cyanoacrylate adhesive has a viscosity of from about 20 to about 60 centipoise at 20°C.
5. The method according to Claim 1 wherein the butyl-2-cyanoacrylate adhesive is applied at a 


concentration of from about 0.02 ml to about 0.05 ml per square centimeter.
6. The method according to Claim 1 wherein the butyl-2-cyanoacrylate adhesive is n-butyl-2- cyanoacrylate adhesive.
7. The method according to Claim 1 wherein said application of butyl-2-cyanoacrylate adhesive to the opposing separated skin sections between the sutures or staples is achieved with a sterile syringe.
8. The method according to Claim 1 which, prior to step (b) , further comprises the steps of joining separated subcutaneous portions of the wound together by sutures.
