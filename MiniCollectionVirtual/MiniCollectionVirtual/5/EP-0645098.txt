<ABSTRACT>
A device is described for removing the excessive tobacco (38), in a cigarette rod machine, from a tobacco rod (16) moving in a tobacco channel (6) on a suction rod conveyor (2). This device has two supporting disks (26a, b) revolving in opposite directions and touching each other at their circumference, and a removal means (32, 34) assigned to the touching zone of the supporting disks. The removal means is designed as a circular knife (32) whose axis (31) extends substantially parallel to the axes (24) of the supporting disks (26). Assigned to the circular knife (32) is a deflector member (34) whose circumferential surface deflects the excess tobacco (38) removed from the rod in a predetermined direction. This device has the advantage that the excessive tobacco is removed from the rod without the action of a mechanical impact and is directed very gently in a particular direction.

Apparatus in a cigarette rod making machine for removing
surplus tobacco from a tobacco rod (16) moving in a tobacco

channel (6) on a suction rod conveyor (1), with two holding discs
(26a, b) which rotate in opposite directions and are at least

approximately in mutual contact by way of their periphery,
roughly in the middle of the tobacco channel (6), at a distance

from the suction rod conveyor (1) corresponding to the intended
rod height, with a removal means associated with the holding

discs on the side facing away from the rod, and with a compacting
means (44) for compacting sections of the tobacco rod (16) before

the removal of the surplus, characterized in that the holding
discs are designed as plane circular discs, in that the removal

means is designed as a circular knife (32) which rotates about
a knife axis (31) and the cutting edge (39) of which passes

through the contact region (33) of the holding discs (26a, b) on
the side of the latter facing away from the rod (16), and in that

a deflector element (34) in the form of a rotational body (36),
which rotates about the knife axis (31) and has an axially

running peripheral surface provided as the deflector surface (37)
and intended for moving in preferred directions the tobacco

particles (38) removed from the rod (16), is associated with the
circular knife (32).
Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterized in that the
circular knife axis (31) runs substantially normal to the surface

of the rod conveyor (2).
Apparatus according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that
the circular knife (32) is attached to an end face of the

deflector element (34, 36).
Apparatus according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that
the deflector surface (37) of the rotational body (36) is of 

substantially frustoconical design.
Apparatus according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that
the deflector surface (37) is designed as a concave recess of the

peripheral surface.
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterized
in that a rotating eccentric wheel (47) which compacts the

tobacco rod (16) at preset intervals is provided, as the
compacting means (44), in the upstream entry region (51) of the

holding discs (26a, b).
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterized
in that a second removal means (41), which removes a portion of

the original surplus from the tobacco rod (16) in order to even
out the surplus of tobacco particles, is provided upstream of the

holding discs (26a, b).
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 7, characterized
in that the deflector element (34) has, at its end face facing

the plane of the holding discs, a cutting edge (39) which acts
as the circular knife (32) and is concentric with its axis of

rotation.
Apparatus according to Claim 8, characterized in that at
least the cutting edge (39) of the deflector element (34)

consists of a hard, wear-resistant material.
