<ABSTRACT>
A dry, initially non-tacky, expansible, shaped and formed 
sealant and baffle component is provided for sealing and 

providing an acoustic baffle for cavities in the hollow 
structural components of a vehicle body or the like, which during 

the manufacturing operation is conveyed through a bake oven at 
an elevated temperature. The component is made up of a metal ion 

neutralized ethylene-α,β ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic 
acid copolymer (ionomer), a blowing agent, and a tackifier, and 

optionally with an additive polymer and a cross-linking agent. 
The blowing agent is selected to be activated at the temperature 

of the bake oven so that the shaped and formed component expands 
in the body cavity to seal the cavity and prevent ingress of 

moisture, dust and other contaminating materials and particles, 
as well as to form a sound barrier therein.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a dry, initially non-tacky, 
heat expansible sealant and baffle composition 
which is formable into a desired shape so that upon 
insertion of a sealant product of predetermined shape into 
a cavity such as the hollow post structure of an automobile 
or similar vehicle, followed by heat induced expansion 
thereof, it serves as a highly effective sealant and 
acoustic baffle within that cavity. In particular, the invention concerns a heat 
expansible sealant and baffle composition which after 
being formed into a desired configuration is adapted to be 
placed within a vehicle post or other body cavity in a 
position such that when the vehicle body is subjected to 
a primer and/or paint baking operation or other process 
which elevates the temperature of the environment surrounding 
the vehicle body, the shaped sealant and baffle 
product expands to an extent that the expanded component 
serves to attenuate annoying sounds that would otherwise 
pass through the cavity. The expanded product also 
functions to seal the cavity and thereby prevent infiltration 
of moisture, dust, air, other undesirable fluids, and 
sound. During the fabrication of automobiles, trucks 
and similar over-the-road vehicles, many body components 
present cavities which require sealing to prevent ingress 
of moisture and contaminants which can cause corrosion of 
the body parts. This is especially true with respect to 
unibody structures in which a heavy frame is replaced with  
 
a structurally designed space frame that inherently 
presents a number of moisture and contaminant collecting 
cavities. These cavities also serve as passages which 
attenuate noise and other sounds transmitted therethrough 
during normal use of the vehicle. For example, the 
upright post structure of a vehicle's body defining a 
portion of a respective window opening presents an elongated 
passage or cavity which can collect moisture and 
contaminants and also transmit annoying sounds unless the 
passage or cavity is at least partially filled with a 
sealant material that blocks entrance of moisture and 
debris, and that also serves as a baffle for muting sounds 
that would otherwise be transmitted along the length of 
the passage or cavity. There are other irregular cavities 
in a vehicle body which desirably are sealed to prevent 
moisture and contaminants from entering that area and 
being conveyed to other parts of the interior of the 
vehicle body. Many attempts have been made to seal these 
cavities, including spraying of
