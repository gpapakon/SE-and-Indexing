<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a film sheet for storing a developed film.
More particularly, it relates to a film sheet wherein users can know contents
of developed film and film numbers to be specified at first sight.Conventionally a developed film is divided into some pieces and stored in a
film sheet. Users can know contents of the film stored in the film sheet by
checking prints, to which the film is printed, one by one, or by holding the
film directly to the light.However, light intensity and hue of the developed film is reverse of those of
the printed photographic paper so that users cannot easily know images of
negatives, especially for colour photograph. When users wish to make additional
prints, therefore, it takes much time for them to know the specific image
and is difficult to distinguish the specific image among the other images if images
similar to the specific image exist in the film. Consequently, wrong film
numbers might he selected for additional prints.The US-A-5,031,771, which is the starting point of the present invention, discloses
a photographic image set including an envelope having small pockets
for inserting an index print and at least one negative film strip. Thus the photographic
image set provides a single storage and retrieval system.
The index print has to be produced on a separate sheet of
photographic paper which afterwards is introduced into one of the pockets.In accordance with the present invention, a film sheet having
a plurality of small pockets wherein a developed film is inserted to be
stored is provided with an index print to which whole numbers of frames in the developed 
film are printed in numeral order of the developed film,
the index print being directly printed on the film sheet.According to a film sheet of the present invention, since an index print on
which a film stored in the film sheet is printed in numeral order is provided on
the film sheet, users can know contents of the film stored in the film sheet at
first sight and easily distinguish specific film numbers among the other film
numbers, while at the same time the film sheet is not larger as is necessary for
storing the negative film strips.
Fig. 1is an explanatory view of one embodiment of a film sheet of the
present invention;Fig. 2is a schematic explanatory view of a printing apparatus for
making an index print shown in Fig. 1; andFig. 3is a schematic explanatory view of another method for making
an index print.Next, an index print and a film sheet of the present invention is explained
with
