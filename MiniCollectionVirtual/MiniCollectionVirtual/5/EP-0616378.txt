<ABSTRACT>
Luminescent silicon incorporating semiconductor quantum wires is made 

using a semiconductor wafer 14 as starting material. The wafer 14 is 
weakly doped p type with a shallow heavily doped p layer therein for 

current flow uniformity purposes. The wafer 14 is anodised in 20% aqueous 
hydrofluoric acid to produce a layer 5 µm thick with 70% porosity and good 

crystallinity. The layer is subsequently etched in concentrated 
hydrofluoric acid, which provides a slow etch rate. The etch increases 

porosity to a level in the region of 80% or above. At such a level, pores 
overlap and isolated quantum wires are expected to form with diameters 

less than or equal to 3 nm. The etched layer exhibits photoluminescence 
emission at photon energies well above the silicon bandgap (1.1 eV) and 

extending into the red region (1.6 - 2.0 eV) of the visible spectrum.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to luminescent silicon and to methods of making it. 
More particularly, it relates to luminescent silicon quantum wires and 
their production. Semiconductor quantum wires are a recent development in the emerging field 
of low dimensional semiconductor device structures. The first such 
structure was the one dimensional quantum well, in which a relatively 
narrow bandgap semiconductor layer is sandwiched between two relatively 
wider bandgap semiconductor layers. A typical quantum well layer 
thickness is in the range 1 to 10 nm. Charge carriers with energies 
intermediate the bandgaps of the two materials are free in the narrow 
bandgap material but would be bound in the wider bandgap material. This 
produces what is referred to as quantum confinement of charge carriers 
within a quantum well formed by a narrow bandgap layer. There is two-dimensional 
freedom for charge carriers within the plane of the layer, and 
one-dimensional confinement. This provides a quantum well layer or 
"quantum plane". One dimensional confinement effects in a-Si:H quantum 
well layers have been reported by Abeles and Tiedje in Physical Review 
Letters Vol. 51 pages 2003-2006 (1983). Structures containing many 
quantum well layers are often referred to as "superlattices". There are 
well established growth techniques available for fabricating Si-based 
superlattices. It is also known to produce so-called silicon "quantum dots" in which 
there is three-dimensional confinement. Furukawa et al, in Phys. Rev. 
B38, p5726 (1988), report the production of very small crystalline 
particles of silicon with diameters in the range 2 nm to 5 nm and having 
hydrogen-passivated surfaces. This material has polyhedral or sphere-like 
grains, as indicated by transmission electron microscopy data, and 
extensive Si-H₂ surface chemical groups detected by infrared absorption. 
Its appearance is that of a pale yellow powder. It exhibits efficient 
room temperature photoluminescence in the red region of the visible 
spectrum, ie at photon energies well above the bulk silicon semiconductor  
 
bandgap. Photoconductivity and optical absorption data suggest that the 
optical bandgap is widened up to 2.4 eV, more than twice the 1.1 eV bulk 
silicon value. One major reason for the interest in quantum confinement in semiconductors 
arises from the desire to create novel electronic and luminescent devices. 
Bulk undoped silicon is unfortunately characterised by very poor 
luminescent properties. Nevertheless, there is considerable
