+
>
-ATPases in the inhibition of vacuolation induced by Helicobacter pylori is disclosed. Preferred agents are the macrolide antibiotics bafilomycins A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2 and D, especially bafilomycin A1. The use of such compounds in the treatment of diseases, including peptic ulceration, is claimed.

<DESCRIPTION>
 USE OF INHIBITORS OF VACUOLΛR-TYPE H+ ATPASES.The present invention relates to inhibitors of cellular vacuolation in pathological conditions. More particularly, the present invention relates to the use of anti-vacuolating agents in the treatment of pathology induced by infection with Helicobacter pylori .Helicobacter pylori is a Gram-negative bacterium commonly found in the human stomach. Although the majority of H. pylori infections are asymptomatic, infection by this organism is statistically linked with the incidence of peptic ulceration, non-autoimmune chronic gastritis and gastric adenocarcinoma (Bartlett, 1988, Gastroenterology, 94.: 229-232; Blaser & Brown, 1989, Advances in Internal Medicine, 3_4: 21-42; Blaser, 1990, Journal of Infectious Diseases, 161: 626-633) .H. pylori infection may lead to vacuolation of infected cells in the gastric mucosa, a process wherein vacuoles appear in the cytoplasm and expand by absorbing fluid. Vacuoles derive from a still undefined intracellular compartment whose lumen is acidic, as indicated by the vital staining with neutral red and the synergistic vacuolating effect of ammonium ions added to the medium of cultured cells or produced by a bacterial urease (International patent application WO90/04030; Cover, et al., 1991, Infect. Immun. , 5_9: 1264-1270; Segal, et al . , 1992, Infect. Immun. , 60; 1883-1889) . Cell vacuolation is known to play a major role in cell death (Figura et al , 1990, Pathogenic Mechanism of Helicobacter pylori : Production of Cytotoxin. In Helicobacter pylori , gastritis and peptic ulcer, Malfertheimer and Dischneit (Eds.), Berlin: Springer-Verlag, pp. 86-95) .The vacuolating influence of H. pylori has been ascribed to both a vacuolating cytotoxin (Cover and Blaser, 1992, JBC, 267: 10570-10575) and to a urease enzyme (Xu et al. 

1990, Journal of Infectious Diseases, 161: 1302-1304) . The vacuolating toxin and urease enzymes have been shown to induce vacuolation of eukaryotic cells in vitro (see Cover and Blaser, Op. Cit. ; Cover et al . , 1991, Op. Cit.).Bafilomycins are a class of macrolide antibiotics isolated from the organism Streptomyceε griseus , which demonstrate both antifungal and antibacterial activity (Werner et al , Journal of Antibiotics, 37: 110-117) . The antibacterial activity of bafilomycins against H. pylori is known to be very poor.Bafilomycin-Al has been shown to be a specific inhibitor of vacuolar-type H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) (Bowman et al , 1988, PNAS, f$5: 7972-7976) , a proton-pumping ATPase capable of forming a
