<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a method and 
apparatus for arranging articles into an array to form a 
layer and loading layers of articles. The invention 
particularly relates to a method and apparatus for 
loading a cart with layers formed from an array of 
bundled signatures. The timely circulating of daily newspapers or other 
signatures requires that every operation from printing 
of the signatures to distribution be performed quickly 
and efficiently. Accordingly, loading and shipping 
signatures to distributors must be performed quickly and 
efficiently without damaging the signatures. After printing, a stacker stacks individual signatures 
into vertical piles which are then secured with string 
to form a bundle. A conveyor carries the bundles to a 
loading station where the bundles are then loaded onto 
carts, pallets, trucks, or other shipping containers. Each bundle is approximately eleven inches in width and 
fourteen inches in length with a height ranging from 
three to eighteen inches, and an average height of ten 
inches. Typical carts have an effective loading height 
of sixty inches and have a loading surface which 
support a 2x2 layer of bundles. Thus, if the bundles are 
ten inches in height, a cart can handle 24 bundles. Cart loading was originally performed manually. Laborers 
positioned at a loading station adjacent the conveyor 
lifted the individual bundles from the conveyor and 
placed them on carts, pallets, trucks, or other shipping 
containers. Automated cart loading systems have been developed, but 
still lack optimum overall system efficiency.  The present invention is directed to a cart loader that 
overcomes various problems previously experienced with 
other cart loaders. Additional features and advantages of the invention will 
be set forth in the description which follows, and in 
part will be apparent from the description, or may be 
learned by practice of the invention. The objectives and 
other advantages of the invention will be realized and 
attained by the process and apparatus particularly 
pointed out in the written description and claims as 
well as the appended drawings. To achieve these and other advantages and in accordance 
with the purpose of an aspect of the invention, as 
embodied and broadly described, the invention includes a 
method and apparatus for loading layers of articles on a 
loading surface by positioning a discharge end of a 
conveyor at a selected discharge elevation, conveying a 
layer of articles on a conveying surface of the
