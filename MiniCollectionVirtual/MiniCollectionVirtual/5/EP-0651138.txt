<ABSTRACT>
A dual function probe (25) for measuring blade 
path temperature and for extracting exhaust flow gases from 

a combustion turbine (1) comprises an elongate tubular 
member (34) having an open end and a sealed end. An elongate 

thermocouple element (41) is centrally disposed within 
the tubular member (34) to provide a thermocouple function. 

At least a portion of the tubular member is adapted for 
insertion through the exhaust cylinder and diffuser of the 

combustion turbine (1) and into the flow path of the 
turbine exhaust gases. An on-off valve (60) is coupled to 

the tubular member (34) proximate the sealed end thereof to 
allow exhaust flow gases that enter the open end of the 

tubular member (34) to be extracted from the tubular member 
for analysis.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a dual function 
probe for measuring combustion turbine exhaust characteristics. 
More specifically, the present invention relates to 
a dual function probe for measuring blade path temperature 
at the exhaust cylinder diffuser inlet of a combustion 
turbine and for extracting exhaust flow gases therefrom to 
facilitate emissions analysis. In an axial flow combustion (gas) turbine, the hot 
gas exhausting from the last row of turbine blades is 
directed through an exhaust diffuser. The exhaust diffuser 
is formed by inner and outer flow liners disposed between 
an exhaust cylinder and a bearing housing. The flow liners 
serve to create a smooth flow path for the hot gas. They 
also act as a barrier which prevents the flow of hot gas 
directly over the exhaust cylinder and bearing housing, 
thereby preventing excessive temperatures and thermal 
stresses in these components. Efficient operation of a combustion turbine 
requires constant monitoring of various aspects of the 
combustion process. One parameter of the combustion 
process that effects combustion efficiency is the blade 
path temperature, i.e., the temperature in the exhaust 
cylinder just aft of the last row of turbine blades. It is 
desirable, therefore, to periodically sample the blade path 
temperature in the combustion turbine. Blade path temperature is usually measured using 
one or more thermocouple assemblies that are inserted  
 
through corresponding guides in the exhaust cylinder of the 
turbine such that the measuring junctions of the thermocouple 
assemblies are positioned within the flow path of the 
turbine exhaust near the last row of turbine blades. 
Typically, multiple thermocouple assemblies are inserted at 
equally spaced points around the annulus of the exhaust 
cylinder. Each thermocouple provides a blade path temperature 
reading for a respective one of the turbine's combustors. 
The measuring junction of each thermocouple is 
situated downstream from a respective combustor near the 
turbine blade aft annulus. In this manner, blade path 
temperature can be monitored for each combustor separately. 
An example of one such gas turbine engine sensor probe may 
be found in U.S. Patent 5,185,996. With the increasing emphasis on the environment, 
it is important to ensure that the turbine exhaust does not 
exceed acceptable emissions levels. Measuring exhaust 
emissions is therefore an important aspect of combustion 
turbine operation. In the past, emissions levels have been 
monitored at the
