<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of an electrode system, comprising a 
measurement electrode, a reference electrode and a counterelectrode, in measuring 
hydrogen peroxide concentration. As regards the state of the art, reference is made to FI patent No. 80 526 disclosing 
a method for controlling the pulping process. In the method an electrode system is 
used which comprises one or more measurement electrodes, reference electrodes and 
power supplying counterelectrodes, positioned in a pulp boiler. Current is supplied 
from a power source to the circuit so that the voltage between the measurement 
electrode and the reference electrode, in other words, the electrochemical potential 
of the measurement electrode is substantially constant, so that the current equivalent 
to said potential is directly proportional to the activity of the chemicals in the boiler. 
For the measurement electrode, coal steel, iron, copper, zinc, cadmium, or monel 
metal can be used. The electrochemical potential of the measurement electrode varies 
in the range from -500 to -1500 millivolt to the calomel electrode. The concentration of hydrogen peroxide is required to be measured, inter alia, from 
the bleaching pulp. A change in the hydrogen peroxide concentration influences a 
variety of factors in the solution. Such factors are, among other things, the idle 
potential of the measurement electrode, the current densities measured on the 
polarisation curve, and the zero point of the polarisation curve, pH, the conductivity 
of the solution, and temperature. The difference of potential between the measurement electrode and the electrolytic 
solution when measured in relation to the reference electrode, that is, the idle 
potential of the measurement electrode, changes as a function of the hydrogen 
peroxide content. The direction and intensity of the change is dependent on the  
 
electrode material used. When an inert material, such as platinum, is used for the 
measurement electrode, the measurement mentioned above yields a so-called redox 
potential. The redox potential is a potential difference characteristic of the solution, 
and caused by redox reactions on the surface of the electrode, measuring the 
oxidation capacity of the solution. The redox potential behaves, when compared with 
the idle potential of an electrode made of a less noble material, less actively because 
the dissolving metal ion is non-existent. Today, an electrode arrangement according to the Finnish patent No. 89 526 is used 
in which a
