<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to the 
isolation and characterization of a binding factor of 

the Hepatitis B virus from normal human sera, as well 
as monoclonal antibodies directed against the HBV-binding 

factor. More particularly, the present 
invention relates to a binding factor of the Hepatitis 

B virus which inhibits the binding of said virus to 
membranes on hepatocytes thus preventing Hepatitis B 

virus from further infecting the liver.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the isolation and 
characterization of a binding factor of the Hepatitis B 
virus from normal human sera which interacts with 
pre-S1 and pre-S2 epitopes of the viral envelope 
proteins of the Hepatitis B virus, located within the 
domains involved in the recognition of hepatocyte 
receptors. More particularly, the present invention 
relates to a binding factor of the Hepatitis B virus 
which inhibits the binding of said virus to membranes 
on hepatocytes thus preventing Hepatitis B virus from 
further infecting the liver. Hepatitis B is a public health problem of 
worldwide importance. In far East-Asia and tropical 
Africa chronic carriers of the hepatitis B virus 
(hereafter being referred to as HBV) represents a large 
proportion of the population and chronic active 
hepatitis and liver cirrhosis remain major causes of 
mortality. Epidemiological studies have clearly 
associated HBV with hepatocellular carcinoma, which is 
one of the most common cancers in the world. Beasly et 
el., Viral Hepatitis and Liver Disease, (ed. Vyas) 
209-224(Grune & Stratton 1984). The pathological consequences of HBV infection, as 
well as the mechanism of liver damage are not fully 
understood. The virus is not cytolytic and the host 
immune response to viral antigens present at the liver 
cell membrane plays a major role in the pathogenesis of 
HBV-related liver diseases. During HBV infection in humans virus particles are 
present in large quantities in the blood of the  
 
infected individual. The presence of these complete 
virions is indicative of active viral multiplication in 
the liver. Besides the complete virion or Dane 
particle, 27 nm particles which characteristically 
carry an outer coat (HBcAg) and inner spherical core 
and 22 nm particles which are related to the outer 
surface or coat (HBsAg) of the hepatitis virus are 
present in sera of infected humans. Many advances have been made over the past ten 
years in isolating the major viral proteins of HBcAg 
and HBsAg, identifying the amino acid sequences 
encoding the proteins and recombinantly produced the 
envelope proteins for vaccine purposes. Thus, it has already been established in the art 
that the HBV envelope consists of three distinct 
coterminal proteins which are encoded by a single 
envelope gene. The S gene encodes for HBsAg and the 
pre-S region consists of both pre-S1 and pre-S2. Both 
pre-S proteins and their respective antibodies can be 
detected during HBV infection. Furthermore, several 
other poorly

An HBV-binding factor characterized in that 
said HBV-binding factor inhibits the binding of the 

Hepatitis B virus to the membranes of human 
hepatocytes. 
The HBV-binding factor of Claim 1, 
characterized in that said HBV-binding factor is 

isolatable from human sera with or in the form of a 
glycoprotein which has a molecular weight of about 50 

kDa, has an isoelectric point of 7.13 and is 
immunologically related to a membrane component of 

human hepatocytes, but not immunologically related to 
hepatocytes of species that are not susceptible to 

Hepatitis B virus infection. 
The HBV-binding factor according to any one of 

Claims 1 or 2, wherein said HBV-binding factor 
interacts with the pre-S1 and pre-S2 epitopes of the 

viral envelope proteins located within the domains 
involved in the recognition of hepatocytes. 
The HBV-binding factor according to any one of 
Claims 1 to 3, wherein said HBV-binding factor

residues, requires intact disulfide bonds, hydrophobic 

bonds and additional non-covalent linkages to maintain 
the necessary conformation for Hepatitis B virus 

recognition, represents a soluble form or fragment of a 
cellular Hepatitis B virus receptor(s), is stable at 37

An HBV-binding factor which can be isolated 
from human sera with or in the form of a glycoprotein

anion-exchange column particularly a DEAE-cellulose 

column;

factor from said anion-exchange column; 
(e) incubating said eluted fractions containing 
HBV-binding factor at 4Â°C for at least two weeks;
