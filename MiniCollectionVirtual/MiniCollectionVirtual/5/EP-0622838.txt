<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is embodied in a technique for precise and accurate height 
control in fabricating solder bumps or joints formed from a solder bump or bumps. A 

solder bump is formed by reflow of a conical solder body having base diameter D, 
height H and cone angle ϑ, and has truncated sphere shape, with height h and 

truncation diameter d. We have found that D, H, and d can be selected such that 
∂h/∂H is small (typically ≦ 0.5), indicative of relative insensitivity of the bump 

height to variation in the height of the conical solder body. The inventive process is 
also applicable to a component (e.g., a laser) solder-bonded to a substrate, and can 

provide previously unattainable control of the spacing between component and 
substrate.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to bonding techniques, more specifically to solder
bump bonding.In, e.g., the communication and computer related fields, there exists the need
for the fusion of electrical and optical technologies. To facilitate the fusion, packaging of
optical fibers and associated optoelectronic components must be advanced. The cost of
producing optical and optoelectronic modules is typically dominated by the cost of
packaging of the devices rather than the cost of the devices. One aspect of device
packaging is the bonding of, e.g., devices. components, assemblies or semiconductor
chips (collectively "components") to a substrate. A bonding approach which has been
used extensively by the electronics industry is the flip-chip solder bump technique.Although solder bump bonding is well established in the electronics industry,
only recently has this approach been used in conjunction with optical and optoelectronic
components. These new uses of solder bump bonding have revealed limitations of the
technique which typically are not of concern in the established applications of the
technique. For example, optical and optoelectronic bonding involves more demanding
alignment tolerances than are customary in electronic bonding. In the latter, alignment in
the substrate plane is typically the only concern. Usually, as long as the wettable pads are
correctly positioned on the substrate, the components will be correctly positioned.
Alignment in the direction normal to the substrate (z-direction) typically has not been a
significant concern in electronic packaging. However, when bonding optical and/or
optoelectronic components to a substrate, the components frequently not only need to be
accurately aligned in the plane of the substrate (x and y directions) but also in the
direction normal to the substrate (z-direction). Exemplarily, if the alignment of an optical
waveguide with respect to the associated laser radiation source is off by even 1 µ m in
any direction, the optical coupling efficiency of the combination can be too low to be
acceptable.Solder bump fabrication by an electrochemical method, disclosed at 31st
Elec. Comp. Cont. May '81, pages 149-155, is also not appropriate for fusion of
optoelectronic components. According to this method, solder bumps are made by
selectively plating Pb/Sn on electrode pads and reflow shaped (wet back) after etching 
off UBM layers except under the bumps. To control the solder constitution of the
bump, Sn and Pb are plated separately, resulting in 95+2% Pb-Sn. To improve
