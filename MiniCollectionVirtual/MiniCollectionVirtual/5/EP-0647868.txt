<ABSTRACT>
An optical switch comprises a first polarization 
converter, and a second polarization converter which is 

provided in series with the first polarization converter. 
The first and second converters are able to select 
as emitted light one of two perpendicular polarized 

light components of incident light having a desired 
wavelength (λ₀) in a polarized state. The first polarization 

converter converts the incident light 
into a polarized light component corresponding 

to one of two points positioned at opposite 
sides to each other on a Poincaré sphere and obtained by 

rotating the incident light at +90° or -90° around an 
axis perpendicular to an axis passing through a point 

corresponding to the incident light on the Poincaré 
sphere and the center of the Poincaré sphere. The 

second polarization converter converts the polarized 
light obtained by the first polarization converter into 

polarized light corresponding to a point obtained by 
rotating the two polarized light components at +90° or 

-90° around an axis passing through the above-mentioned 
two points on the Poincaré sphere.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical 
switch, more particularly to an optical switch provided 
with an element for converting an optical polarization 
plane, such as a Faraday rotator or an element using an 
electric optical effect (below, "electro-optic element"). Optical switches, integral components of 
optical communication systems, generally make use of 
Faraday rotators or electro-optic elements so as to 
convert a plane of polarization of light into two 
perpendicular polarized light components. Such optical switches, however, are effective 
only for light having predetermined wavelengths. If 
the light has a wavelength other than the predetermined 
wavelength, the converted polarized light components 
will not be perpendicular, resulting in cross talk and 
obstructing correct optical communications. An embodiment of the present invention can provide 
an optical switch whose effectiveness is independent of 
the wavelength of light. An embodiment of the present invention can provide 
an optical switch with a high extinction ratio. It is still another object to provide an optical 
switch enabling correct optical communications. According to the present invention, there is 
provided an optical switch comprising: a first polarization 
converter and a second polarization converter 
provided in series with the first polarization converter. 
The first and second converters are able to select as 
emitted light one of two perpendicular polarized light 
components of incident light having a desired wavelength 
(λ₀) in a polarized state. The first polarization  
 
converter converts the incident light having wavelength 
λ₀ into a polarized light component corresponding to 
one of two points positioned at opposite sides to each 
other on a Poincaré sphere and obtained by rotating the 
incident light +90° or -90° around an axis perpendicular 
to an axis passing through a point corresponding to the 
incident light on the Poincaré sphere and the center of 
the Poincaré sphere. The second polarization converter 
converts the polarized light obtained by the first 
polarization converter into polarized light corresponding 
to a point obtained by rotating the two 
polarized light components +90° or -90° around an axis 
passing through the above-mentioned two points on the 
Poincaré sphere. Reference is made, by 
way of example, to the accompanying drawings, 
in which: 
Fig. 1 is a schematic view of a conventional 
optical switch; Fig. 2 is an view for explaining a polarization 
state of the optical switch of
