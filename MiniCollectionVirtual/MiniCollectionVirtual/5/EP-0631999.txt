<ABSTRACT>
The present invention teaches masonry water repellents comprising 
aqueous emulsions of alkylalkoxysilanes with either a quaternary ammonium 

surfactant or a mixture of a quaternary ammonium surfactant with an amino and/or a 
nonionic surfactant. The alkylalkoxysilane is present at a level of about one to sixty 

weight percent of the final solution weight. The surfactants are present at levels of 
about 0.05 to 25 weight percent of the final solution weight. The useful quaternary 

ammonium surfactants are alkyltrimethyl or dialkyldimethyl ammonium compounds or 
quaternary ammonium modified dimethylpolysiloxanes. Amino and nonionic 

surfactants are used as additives to the quaternary surfactants. The types of nonionic 

surfactants contemplated herein are alkylamines and alkyl acetylenic alcohols.

<DESCRIPTION>
Concrete structures can undergo accelerated deterioration due to 
corrosion of the reinforcing steel rods. The corrosion is caused by the gradual 
introduction of chloride into the concrete from deicing salts. Applying penetrating 
sealers can greatly diminish the intrusion of chloride into the concrete. Solutions of alkyltrialkoxysilanes in organic solvents have been used 
very effectively to impart water repellent properties to porous masonry substrates such 
as mortar and concrete. These formulations penetrate the masonry substrate and 
provide a significant hydrophobic layer. However, solvent base formulations are 
undesirable due to the large amount of volatile organic components that are released 
into the air during their use. Various state regulations prohibit the volatile organic 
content (VOC) of an architectural coating from exceeding four hundred grams per 
liter. The prior art solvent base coatings have not met these regulations. To 
reduce the amount of organic compounds released into the air, preparations of 
aqueous emulsions of alkyltrialkoxysilanes have been reported.  
 The utility of silanes in such aqueous emulsions, especially 
alkoxysilanes, as masonry water repellents is a widely known use because of their 
hydrophobic nature. For example, U.S. Patent No. 4,648,904 issued to DePasquale 
and Wilson teaches a porous masonry water repellent composition comprising: a 
hydrolyzable silane, an emulsifying agent and water. U.S. Patent No. 4,877,654 
issued to Wilson teaches a similar composition but also contains a buffering 
compound to maintain the composition within the pH stable range. U.S. Patent No. 
5,074,912, issued to Liles and Klein also teaches a water repellent composition for 
treating porous substrates consisting of an emulsion containing water, at least one 
surfactant, and a siloxane. However, the emulsifiers taught therein are generally 
nonionic surfactants and only one type of silane (the active ingredient) may be used at 
a time in each emulsion. It has been found that nonionic emulsifiers, in particular 
highly ethoxylated surfactants, reduce the hydrophobic effect of these compositions. 
This leads to an increase in water absorption of the masonry material and in most 
cases a reduction in penetration depth of the silane. Another example of prior art aqueous emulsions is taught in U.S. 
Patent No. 4,433,013 issued to Puhringer, which discloses a water-sealant 
for 
inorganic porous mineral substrates which comprise an emulsion of at least one silane,
