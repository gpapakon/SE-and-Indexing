<ABSTRACT>
A belt fastener with fastener clamps (1) for connecting the belt ends of conveyor belts. The fastener clamps (1) have hinge bends (3). On their inside, the hinge bends (3) have a lining (6) of wearing material with a low coefficient of friction so that, in the case of hinge bends (3), engaging hinge-like one inside the other, of the fastener clamps (1) of two belt fasteners and a coupling rod passed through the hinge bends (3), the friction between this coupling rod and the hinge bends (3) is considerably reduced. The wear is thereby also reduced at the same time. The hinge bends themselves in particular remain virtually unaffected by such wear.

A belt connector with connector clips (1), arranged in series, for 
connecting the belt ends (2) of conveyor belts, in which the connector clips (1) 

are constructed so as to be U-shaped in side view in which in addition the 
connector clips (1) have hinge curves (3) and the hinge curves (3) have on their 

inner side a lining (6) of wear material with a low coefficient of friction. and in 
which the hinge curves (3) have a flat U-shaped cross-section with inwardly bent 

U-shanks (7), characterised in that the lining (6) on the inner side of the hinge 
curves (3) is fixed between the U-base (8) and the bent U- arms (7). 
A belt connector according to Claim 1, characterised in that the lining (6) 
consists of a metal alloy, for example Cu alloy such as bronze or the like. 
A belt connector according to Claim 1, characterised in that the lining (6) 
consists of a plastic material, for example polytetrafluoroethylene. 
A belt connector according to one of Claims 1 to 3, with a sealing section 
for the sealing of the hinge curves and of a common coupling rod for hinge 

curves of two belt connectors, which hinge curves engage into each other in an 
articulated manner, characterised in that the lining (6) of the hinge curves (3) 

adjoins the sealing section (11). 
A belt connector according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised in that 
the lining(s) (6) and the sealing section (11) are constructed as a one-piece 

component. 
A belt connector according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterised in that 
the lining (6) engages with a T-shaped extension (9) behind the inwardly bent 

U-arms (7) of the hinge curves (3).  
 
A belt connector according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterised in that 
the lining (6) engages over the two side faces (10) of the hinge curves (3). 
A belt connector according to one of Claims 1 to 7, characterised in that 
the lining (6) is secured by means of an adhesive connection on the inner face 

and if necessary on the side faces (10) of the hinge curves (3).
