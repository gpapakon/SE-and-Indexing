<DESCRIPTION>
 AN IMPROVED METHOD FOR THE PREPARATION OF CERTAIN 3-LACTAM ANTIBIOTICS.FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to an improved method for the preparation of cephalosporins, i.e. /3-lactam antibiotics comprising a 7-amino-8-oxo-5-thia-l-azabi- cyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-ene nucleus.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe bulk market for /3-lactam antibiotics is a highly competitive field and one of the parameters which influence the price is the purity of the product. Therefore, it is very important for a producer to have access to a pro¬ duction method which gives a high yield of a very pure pro¬ duct. Presently, most of the cephalosporins used are so-called semi-synthetic products. This designation implies that they are obtained by modifying a /3-lactam product ob¬ tained by fermentation by one or more chemical reactions. Typically, one of the chemical reactions involved in this modification is acylation of the 7-amino group of an inter¬ mediate cephalosporin nucleus the parent of which is origi¬ nally obtained by fermentation and optionally further modi¬ fied in other chemical reactions.In the following, the acyl group introduced at the 7-amino group is referred to as the cephalosporin side chain or just the side chain. The acid corresponding to the side chain is designated the side chain acid. The designa¬ tion "a cephalosporin nucleus" designates a compound the acylation of which with the cephalosporin side chain results in the formation of a /3-lactam antibiotic or, more specifi¬ cally, a cephalosporin. 

 The acylation can be performed by reacting an optionally protected form of the cephalosporin nucleus with a derivative - e.cr. the acid chloride - of an optionally protected form of the cephalosporin side chain in an organic solvent - typically methylene chloride - in the presence of a base. As an alternative to the acid chloride a mixed anhydride can be used for the acylation. In both cases, the acylation has to be carried out under anhydrous conditions at a temperature which should preferably be below zero. The acylation reaction never comes to completion and at the point when the work up is started, the reaction mixture will contain the desired product as well as un- reacted starting materials and possible byproducts. After the acylation, the protective groups, if any, have to be re- moved either in situ or after the protected intermediate product has been isolated. The working up of the inter¬ mediate product and the removal of the protective groups generally involves at least one step in which the
