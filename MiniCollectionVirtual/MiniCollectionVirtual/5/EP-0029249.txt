<ABSTRACT>
In a naturally commutated cycloconverter for convert­
ing the output of a variable speed generator to a constant 

output frequency, e.g., 400 Hz, there is provided an end 
stop control circuit for ensuring commutation of power 

switching devices that includes timing wave generators for 
both rectification and inversion end stops. The timing wave 

generators are phase locked with the generator outputs 
but are controllable by end stop bias signal derived from a 

variable system parameter (e.g., load current) that may be 
independent of the source, to provide prompt protection 

against any converter malfunctions due to excess load 
currents. 
Further provided is an excess current detector em­
ploying, for each phase, a pair of high slew rate, high cur­

rent unipolar output operational amplifiers connected in a 
voltage follower configuration with a common pull-up resis­

tor and a common load capacitor to develop a peak cur­
rent signal representing the greater of the positive and ne­

rent signal representing the greater of the positive and 
negative peaks of the alternating phase current.
