<ABSTRACT>
To attract a workpiece with a limited contact region, 
e.g., a doughnut-shaped compact disc (38) having a 

central circular hole (40), a skirt (56) of a substantially 
arcuate attractor (36) is held against an annular land (44) 

extending around the central circular hole (40). Suction 
forces are applied through a plurality of suction holes surrounded 

by the skirt (56) to attract the annular land (44) 
for attracting and carrying the compact disc (38). A mini 

disc (146) having an annular step along a peripheral region 
around a central hole thereof may stably be attracted and
 
carried by an attractor having inner and outer annular contact 

members (161, 164) which axially project different distances 
to contact the peripheral region and an area, respectively, 

that is radially spaced from the peripheral region 
by the annular step.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a suction pad for 
attracting under suction a disk-shaped workpiece having a 
central hole, such as a mini disc, a compact disc, a laser 
disc, or the like and carrying the attracted disk-shaped 
workpiece to a desired position. Suction pads connected to a source of vacuum have 
heretofore been widely used to attract and carry workpieces. 
Such a suction pad comprises a main body connected to a 
source of vacuum through a tube or the like mounted in a 
port, and a flexible attracting portion integral with the 
main body for contacting a surface of a workpiece when the 
workpiece is to be attracted by the suction pad. One known suction pad for attracting under suction 
a substantially disk-shaped workpiece having a central hole 
is disclosed in Japanese laid-open utility model 
publications Nos. 61-169541 and 62-172582, for example. The suction pad disclosed in Japanese laid-open 
utility model publication No. 61-169541 is shown in FIG. 13A 
of the accompanying drawings. As shown in FIG. 13A, the 
suction pad, generally designated by the reference numeral 
2, comprises a larger-diameter pad 6 in the form of a 
substantially circular dome which is held in the bottom of a  
 
housing 4, and a smaller-diameter hermetic seal ring 10 
supported coaxially with the housing 4 by a centering shaft 
8. Each of the larger-diameter pad 6 and the smaller-diameter 
hermetic seal ring 10 serves as a pad for 
attracting a surface of a workpiece 12 under suction. The 
larger-diameter pad 6 and the smaller-diameter hermetic seal 
ring 10 are of a double structure in which they are held 
coaxially with each other. The hermetic seal ring 10 
supports a land 16 on its bottom surface for fitting in a 
hole 14 defined centrally in a workpiece 12 to position the 
suction pad 2 with respect to the workpiece 12. For 
attracting the workpiece 12 under suction, the hermetic seal 
ring 10 is held against the workpiece 12 along an inner 
peripheral region around the hole 14 thereby to close the 
hole 14, and the pad 6 which is larger in diameter than the 
hermetic seal ring 10 is brought into abutment against the 
workpiece 12. Then, a negative pressure or vacuum is 
developed in a space between the hermetic seal ring 10 and 
the pad 6 for thereby attracting the workpiece 12 under 
suction. FIG. 13B of the accompanying drawings shows the 
suction pad disclosed in Japanese laid-open utility model 
publication No. 62-172582. As shown in FIG. 13B, the 
suction pad, generally designated by the reference

<CLAIMS>
A suction pad for attracting a workpiece having 
a hole defined therein, comprising: 

   an attractor of a flexible material for abutment 
against the workpiece along a peripheral region thereof 

around the hole; and 
   a main body joined to said attractor and having a 

communication passage defined therein, for supplying suction 
forces from a source of vacuum through said communication 

passage to said attractor; 
   said main body having a through opening for being 

kept aligned with the hole of the workpiece when the attractor 
is held in abutment against the workpiece along the 

peripheral region thereof. 
A suction pad according to claim 1, wherein 
said attractor and said main body are integrally formed with 

each other, further comprising a reinforcing member disposed 
between said attractor and said main body for holding said 

attractor against the peripheral region of the workpiece. 
A suction pad according to claim 1, wherein 
each of said attractor and said main body is of a curved 

shape extending along the peripheral region of a hole 
defined in the workpiece and has opposite ends spaced from 

each other. 
A suction pad according to claim 2, wherein 
each of said attractor and said main body is of a curved 

shape extending along the peripheral region of a hole 
defined in the workpiece and has opposite ends spaced from 

each other. 
A suction pad according to claim 1, wherein 
said attractor has a pair of radially spaced annular contact 

members axially projecting different distances toward the 
workpiece, respectively, for contacting the peripheral 

region of a hole defined in the workpiece and an area of the 
workpiece which is radially spaced from the peripheral 

region by an annular step, respectively.
