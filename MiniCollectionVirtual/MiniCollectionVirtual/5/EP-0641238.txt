<DESCRIPTION>
In many applications, cryogenically cooled baffles 
are positioned within a fluid conduit to trap gases, 
particularly water vapor, and thus remove the gases from 
the flowing fluid. For example, although diffusion pumps 
are very efficient at removing many gases from the 
environment to create a vacuum, they are not efficient in 
pumping water vapor. Therefore, it is common practice to 
position a cold trap in-line ahead of the diffusion pump 
to remove the water vapor as the remainder of the gases 
in the fluid are drawn by the diffusion pump. Similarly, 
cold traps are used in-line ahead of other vacuum pumps 
such as turbomolecular pumps. Since cryogenically cooled cold traps are capture 
devices, they must periodically be regenerated to clear 
the water which collects as frost on the baffles. To 
that end, refrigeration is discontinued, and the baffles 
are allowed to warm or are heated in order to release the 
trapped water. One mechanism of release is that of 
sublimation with removal of the released water vapor by a 
roughing pump. However, sublimation is a slow process 
which is difficult to control. More likely, the water 
melts to a liquid which is then difficult to remove from 
the system. According to one aspect of the present invention 
there is provided a cold trap comprising a fluid conduit 
for coupling into a fluid flow path, a cryopumping 
surface within the fluid conduit to be cooled to 
cryogenic temperature, and a drain port for draining 
liquid from the fluid conduit, characterized in that the  
 
fluid conduit is a cylinder having connecting flanges at 
opposite ends thereof for coupling into the fluid flow 
path with a trough formed about the periphery of the 
fluid conduit in an upper surface of the lower connecting 
flange, the drain port leads from the peripheral trough 
and a lower edge of the cryopumping surface is positioned 
near to the cylinder above the trough such that liquid 
drains therefrom to the trough, the said cryopumping 
surface not being part of and having no contact with the 
fluid conduit. According to a further aspect of the present 
invention there is provided a method of trapping fluid in 
the fluid flow path of a cold trap and regenerating the 
cold trap, which method comprises suspending a 
cryopumping surface in the fluid flow path; cooling the 
cryopumping surface to capture fluid from the fluid flow 
path; warming the cryopumping surface to melt the 
captured fluid and draining liquid from the cryopumping 
surface through a drain port and a valve;
