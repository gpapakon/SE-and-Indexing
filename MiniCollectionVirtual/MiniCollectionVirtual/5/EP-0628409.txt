<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a method for making a lithographic 
printing plate comprising image-wise exposing to actinic radiation a 

heat mode recording material comprising on a support a metallic 
layer and on top thereof a hydrophilic layer having a thickness of 

less than 50 nm thereby rendering the exposed areas hydrophobic and 
acceptant to greasy ink. The obtained printing plate may be used 

without further processing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a heat mode recording material 
for making a lithographic printing plate for use in lithographic 
printing. The present invention further relates to a method for 
imaging said heat mode recording material by means of a laser. Lithographic printing is the process of printing from specially 
prepared surfaces, some areas of which are capable of accepting ink 
(oleophilic areas) whereas other areas will not accept ink 
(oleophobic areas). The oleophilic areas form the printing areas 
while the oleophobic areas form the background areas. Wet printing plates can be prepared using a photographic 
material that is image wise receptive or repellant to ink upon 
photoexposure of the photographic material. However heat mode 
recording materials, the surface of which can be made image-wise 
receptive or repellant to ink upon image-wise exposure to heat 
and/or subsequent development are also known for preparing wet 
printing plates. Particular interesting heat mode recording materials for 
printing plate applications are those comprising on a support a thin 
metal layer sensitive to hydrophobic-hydrophilic mapping of an image 
by laser irradiation. For example Japanese patent application laid open to public 
inspection no. 52-37104 discloses an offset printing plate 
comprising on a support (for example on aluminium, a polyester film, 
R.C. paper etc.) (i) an anodically produced, porous aluminiumoxide 
layer having a thickness of more than 0.5 nm and (ii) a layer 
containing cupper, silver, brass or graphite. The surface of the 
plate is exposed to a laser beam of high energy density to render 
the exposed areas hydrophilic. An offset printing plate is thus 
obtained. The disclosed heat mode recoding material is of low 
sensitivity as revealed by the hich laser energy, about 1 W, and 
rather slow writing speed of about 2 m/s. The US-A-5 401 611 assigned to the present applicant and filed 
on 5.2.93 discloses a heat mode material of high sensitivity, 
comprising on a support, having a hydrophilic surface or provided  
 
with a hydrophilic layer, a metallic layer and on top thereof a 
hydrophobic layer having a thickness of less than 50 nm. The surface 
of the plate, e.g. a hydrophobized silver layer, is exposed to a 
laser beam rendering the exposed image areas hydrophilic and 
repellant to greasy ink. FR-A-1,092,609 discloses a material for lithography comprising a 
support, a thin aluminium layer and a hydrophilic aluminum oxide 
layer with a thickness not larger than the diameter
