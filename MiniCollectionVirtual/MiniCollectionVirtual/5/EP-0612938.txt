<ABSTRACT>
Device for a gear (10), preferably a central gear 
belonging to a motor vehicle, incorporating a gear 

housing (12) partially filled with lubricant and at least 
one external lubricating oil reconditioning unit (30), 

preferably an oil filter. The unit (30) is fixed to the 
gear housing (12) at a mounting section arranged on it, 

which section incorporates ducts (40, 50) designed for 
conveying lubricant between the gear housing (12) and the 

external unit (30). The energy required for conveying 
the lubricant to the unit (30) and back to the gear 

housing (12) is obtained from the kinetic energy of the 
gear unit (22).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a device for a gear according 
to the preamble to patent claim 1. The gears, for example gears in motor vehicles, which are 
currently available are in most cases lubricated by so-called 
splash lubrication. This means that the gear 
housing has an oil sump which is partially filled with 
oil so that at least one gearwheel is at least partially 
immersed in the oil. During operation the gearwheel 
rotates and oil is therefore splashed up from the sump, 
providing the required lubrication. 
The solution causes the oil to become increasingly 
contaminated the longer the gear is in operation, which 
in turn gives rise to increased wear. In order to reduce 
this wear, and hence increase the life of the gear, the 
oil is changed at suitable intervals during the life of 
the gear. One method of extending the life of the gear still 
further is to arrange a filter on the gear for the 
purpose of continuously cleaning the oil. This is now 
done today, for example, in some vehicle gearboxes. Such 
a solution may even allow a longer operating time between 
the required services, which are both expensive and time-consuming. 
However, such a solution means that the oil must be 
pumped through the filter by means of a pumping device, 
which imposes a more expensive and more complicated gear 
design. In the case of central gears arranged on the drive shaft 
of the motor vehicle the problem is particularly serious 
because in most cases splash lubrication only is used, 
without any form of filtration.  
 DE-A-40 23 354 shows a solution in which the crownwheel of 
the central gear throws up oil to a reservoir arranged 
inside the gear housing. The oil is then fed down from 
the reservoir via pipes for lubricating parts difficult 
to reach, such as hub bearings, from which the oil returns 
to the oil sump. According to the solution kinetic 
energy from the crownwheel is converted by the displacement 
of the oil to potential energy to allow lubrication. 
Filtration or other reconditioning 
means are not mentioned in that DE-A 40 23 354. The reasoning set out above also applies to types of 
lubricating oil reconditioning other than filtration, for 
example cooling of the oil by allowing it to be fed 
through an external cooling pipe. JP-A 590 018 70 shows a design for cooling the lubricating oil of a gear box and comprises the features outlined in the preamble of claim 1. 
The kinetic energy of a crown wheel is used for feeding the oil through an 
external cooling circuit. The inlet of the circuit

Device for a gear (10), comprising a gear housing 
(12) partially filled with lubricant, and at least one 

external unit (30) fixed to the gear housing (12), 
through which unit (30) the lubricant is conveyed for 

reconditioning, whereby the energy required for the 
conveying is obtained by transmission of kinetic energy 

from a gearwheel (22) to the lubricant by means of direct 
interaction between said gearwheel (22) and the lubricant, 

wherein a duct (40) is 
arranged for conveying lubricant to the external unit 

(30), which duct has an inlet (44) located in the 
vicinity of the periphery of the gearwheel (22), which 

inlet (44) has a direction such that the lubricant flow 
into the inlet (44) has an essentially tangential 

direction of the gearwheel (22), and a connection (50) is 
arranged for conveying lubricant from the external unit 

(30) to the gear housing (12),

in that the external unit (30) is mounted to a 

mounting section (16) comprising the duct (40) and the 
connection (50).
