<ABSTRACT>
Image quality adjusting apparatus includes a display unit (15)
displaying an input original image, an area designating unit (12)

designating an arbitrary area of the original image displayed on display
unit (15), and an arithmetic processing unit (14) adjusting image quality of

the input original image, based on pixel values of the area designated by
the area designating unit (12). Arithmetic processing unit (14) includes an

object color detecting unit (14a) detecting object color of the area designated
by area designating unit (12), color adjusting unit (14b) for performing color

adjustment of the object color detected by object color detecting unit (14a),
and a luminance. saturation adjusting unit (14c) adjusting luminance and

saturation of the input original image. Arithmetic processing unit (14)
adjusts image quality of the input original image based on pixel values of

the area designated by area designating unit (12), and therefore it becomes
possible for the user to perform image quality adjustment to attain

prescribed quality by simple operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to image processing technique used in word processors, personal computers, work stations, personal digital assistants, copying machines, scanners, facsimile machines, television receivers, video cassette recorders, video cameras, digital still cameras and so on. More specifically, the present invention relates to method and apparatus of image quality adjustment for adjusting an acquired image to a state desired by an operator, for example, for improving image quality of a photograph, as well as to a recording medium recording an image quality adjusting program.Recently, digitized images obtained through cameras, video cassette recorders and through the Internet come to be widely used in various fields. Sometimes these images are used as they are, and sometimes the images are used with image quality adjusted. As a method of adjusting image quality, automatic adjustment of image quality of a photograph or an image using an image processing apparatus provided in a personal computer, a word processor or the like has been studied to enable reduction in necessary working time, mass processing and easy and handy image quality adjustment of a prescribed quality without requiring special skill of the operator.In an automatic image quality adjusting function employed in a general image processing software, a shadow point and a highlight point of luminance are found from luminance histogram distribution or the like. The histogram is expanded or compressed such that the shadow point is set to a specific luminance value, for example, the lowest possible luminance value which can be handled by the image processing apparatus, and similarly, the highlight point is set to a specific luminance value, for example, the highest possible luminance value which can be handled by the image processing apparatus, so that contrast is improved and the image quality is adjusted.In the image processing method described above, the simplest manner of determining the shadow point is to determine a pixel having the lowest luminance among all the pixels in the image as the shadow point, and the simplest manner of determining the highlight point is to determine a pixel having highest luminance among all the pixels in the image as the highlight point.Japanese Patent No. 2527715 discloses an image processing method which is another method of adjusting image quality.In the image processing method disclosed in Japanese Patent No. 2527715, hue value of a pixel having a prescribed hue among pixels of an image is
