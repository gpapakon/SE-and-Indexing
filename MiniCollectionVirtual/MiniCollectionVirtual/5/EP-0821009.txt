<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a catalyst system useful for polymerizing
or copolymerizing olefins, α-olefins, cyclic olefins, diolefins, vinyl and/or
styrene monomers in the slurry or gas phase with improved reactor operability;
more specifically, a catalyst system comprises: i ) a metallocene having at
least one ligand of unsubstituted or substituted cyclopentadienyl skeleton being
linked by an anchored chain; ii) at least one carrier; and iii) an activator
selected from alkylaluminoxane and alkylaluminum, wherein said carrier is
linked to said metallocene by the anchored chain.Regarding the catalyst composition for polymerizing or copolymerizing 
olefins, α-olefins, diolefins and/or cyclic olefins, several types of catalyst
composition have been known, in detail, Phillips type catalysts containing
chromium transition metal, free radical initiators, Ziegler-Natta catalysts
containing titanium/aluminum compounds or vanadium/aluminum compounds,
and metallocene/alkyl aluminoxane catalysts.Among those catalysts, Ziegler-Natta catalysts have been regarded as
an industrially useful catalyst for polymerizing olefins in the solution, slurry or gas
phase. For polymerizing linear high density polyethylene, linear low density
polyethylene(LLDPE) and isotactic polypropylene, the Ziegler-Natta catalysts
having titanium as the main transition metal have been used. On the other hand,
for the production of ethylene-propylene copolymers, ethylene-propylene-diene
terpolymers and syndiotactic polypropylene, some vanadium-based catalyst
systems have been used.Recently, metallocene/alkyl aluminoxane catalysts have been developed for
polymerizing or copolymerizing linear olefins, α-olefins, diolefins, cyclic olefins
monomers. As shown in following formula(A), metallocene catalysts are
transition metal compounds having at least one ligand of an unsubstituted or
substituted cyclopentadienyl skeleton being bonded to a central transition metal
atom. 

wherein
M :transition metal belonging to the groups of IV B, V B and VI B of
Periodic Table,R :alkyl, alkylidene or halogen radicals,S :hydrogen or alkyl radicals, andB :alkylidene or alkylene groups or heteroatom groups.Among them, a preferable transition metal metallocene catalysts is
selected from titanium, zirconium and hafnium. On the other hand, to increase
the catalytic activity of metallocene significantly, a cocatalyst selected from
alkylaluminoxane, cyclicalkylaluminoxane, alkylaluminum and/or a mixture of them
has been required. Among those cocatalysts,
