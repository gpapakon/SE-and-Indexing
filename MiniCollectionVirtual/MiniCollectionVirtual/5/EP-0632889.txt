 Phosphate Selective Composition and Electrode BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Technical Field:This invention relates to the use of an anion selectiv compound in a membrane to measure the amount of a specifi anion of choice in aqueous solution. Background Art;Existing ion selective electrodes specific for anion typically have poor response characteristics including smal linear ranges, high detection limits, and many interferenc es. Prior attempts to design such anion-specific electrode have met with considerable difficulty. There is a need fo a phosphate ion selective electrode having good selectivit and response characteristics employing existing electrod designs. With such a usable ion selective electrode, non destructive techniques for the measurement of phosphat anions by an ion selective electrode can be applied to al areas of measurement science including environmental, medical and industrial applications.Because phosphate anions are ubiquitous, an io selective electrode selective for phosphate anions i particularly desirable. There have been numerous attempt to fabricate membranes suitable for such use. Thes attempts have included the formation of membranes fro insoluble phosphate salts, and the incorporation of enzyme in the membrane to promote enzymatic reactions in th 

membrane. Unfortunately these systems have failed to yield anything but poorly responding electrodes with high detection limits or unsuitably high interferences from other common anions, thus rendering them of no practical use.U.S. Pat. No. 3,857,777 to Guilbault et al, describes a phosphate selective electrode based on membranes containing a mixed complex consisting of silver, thiourea, and HPO~. Unfortunately, selective electrodes based on this system suffer from severe interferences such as Cl", NO", and other abundant anions. Furthermore this electrode deterior¬ ates rapidly and does not produce consistent results after three days.U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,735,692 and 4,900,404, to Arnold et al, describe a group of organo-tin compounds selective to HPO^~ ions used to produce a membrane electrode selective to phosphate. These organo-tin compounds specifically bis(p- chlorobenzyl)tin dichloride are thought to complex phosphate anions preferentially. It was later determined that these electrodes suffer from severe interferences from other commonly occurring anions and that electrodes based on the bis(p-chlorobenzyl)tin dichloride are actually more sensitive to SCN" than phosphate. Additionally, electrodes based on these compounds have a
