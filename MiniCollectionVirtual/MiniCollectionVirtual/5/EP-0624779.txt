<ABSTRACT>
An air core gauge comprises a rotatably 
mounted magnetic rotor (86), a first coil (82) mounted 

in proximity of the magnetic rotor (80) such that when 
electric current flows through the first coil (82), 

the magnetic rotor (86) is within immediate proximity 
of at least part of a magnetic field created by the 

coil (82). A second coil (88) is mounted in proximity 
of the magnetic rotor (80) such that when electric 

current flows through the second coil (88), the 
magnetic rotor is within immediate proximity of at 

least part of a magnetic field created by the second 
coil (88). A current source (80) is coupled to the 

first coil (82), and generates an AC signal across the 
first coil (82) so as to develop an AC output signal 

across the second coil, the AC output signal having a 
magnitude which varies in relation to the rotational 

position of the rotor (86). A measuring apparatus 

(94) detects the AC output signal as a measure of the 
position of the rotor (86).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an instrument, for 
example an air core gauge, and to a method of 
providing feedback in an air core gauge. Typical analogue displays, such as in 
vehicle instrument panels, utilised air core gauges to 
position pointers in relation to sensor values. The 
basic air core gauge mechanism includes a 
substantially circular disc of magnetised material 
fixed to a spindle and surrounded by at least two 
coils of wire, with at least one coil typically 
perpendicular to another of the coils. When electric 
current passes through the coils, a magnetic field is 
produced exerting a force on the magnetised disc. The 
angular direction of the field produced by the coils 
primarily depends on the number of ampere-turns in 
each of the coils. The resultant magnetic field 
produced can be represented by the vector addition of 
the fields produced by each of the coils. The basic two coil air core gauge is 
typically driven by one of two methods. In the first 
method, shown in Figure 1, coil 38 is biased to a 
fixed voltage Vign, through load resistor 34, while 
the voltage across coil 36 varies with a signal from 
sensor 32, a variable resistance sender forming with 
load resistor 30 a voltage divider between Vign and 
ground. As the voltage across coil 36 varies, the 
direction of the resultant magnetic field, with which 
the rotor rotates to align itself, varies. In the second basic method, shown in Figure 
2, a signal on line 50 from a sensor (not shown), 
typically a signal with a frequency varying with a 
vehicle parameter, is converted to an analogue signal 
through circuit 52 and input into a sine/cosine drive 
circuit 56. The sine/cosine drive circuit 56  
 
generates a signal on line 58 proportional to the 
cosine of the desired angle of deflection of the rotor 
and a signal on line 60 proportional to the sine of 
the desired angle of deflection of the rotor. Coils 
62 and 64, in response to the signals on lines 58 and 
60, develop magnetic fields with sine and cosine 
component magnetic vectors correlating to the desired 
pointer rotation. Various other methods which are not 
set forth herein are also used to drive air core 
gauges. Conventional drive methods for air core 
gauges, including the methods set forth above, are 
typically open loop systems in which actuation 
currents are applied to the coils without the use of 
any feedback information as to the actual pointer 
position to correct the values of the currents. Pointer direction errors can arise from many 
sources. Some of
