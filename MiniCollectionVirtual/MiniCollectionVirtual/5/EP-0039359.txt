<ABSTRACT>
A mixing chamber for an intake manifold, which is positioned between the carburetor and the intake manifold. The device could be constructed as an integral structure with the intake manifold or might well be an add on item which is mounted with bolts and gaskets between the carburetor and the intake manifold. The device comprises a chamber case (10) divided into two compartments, which would generally be described as the upper half (24) and the lower half (26). The configuration generally corresponds to two dishlike structures meeting at a center portion. Mounted in the center portion of the chamber case is a diffusion screen (30) projecting through the diameter of the device and secured to the chamber case at its maximum diameter. Mounted in the center of the diffusion screen (30) is perforated, circular structure referred to as a splatter plate (28). Projecting diagonally through the chamber case (10) is a hot air conduit (32) with a loop center portion referred to as a heating coil (34) which is in contact with the splatter plate (28) and/or diffusion screen (30). The vacuum of the intake manifold will draw air through the hot air conduit (32) from exhaust manifold and heats the interior of the chamber case (10). A conduit regulator valve regulates (38) the rate of hot air flow through the conduit (32) exhausting into the intake manifold through the hot air outlet (42). The device may be employed as a fuel tank vapor circuit. This circuit leads from the fuel tank (52) to the chamber case (10). An external source of air pressure (54) leads through an air inlet pipe (56) into the bottom of the leads through an air inlet pipe (56) into the bottom of the fuel tank. The air bubbling up through the gasoline into the tank creates vapor which moves over and around a baffle plate (60) to the tank vapor pipe (58) through a check valve (62) into a vapor reservoir (64) through a vapor regulator (66) and is discharged through a vapor jet (68) into the interior of chamber case (10) between the carburetor and the intake manifold.

 DescriptionMixing Chamber for an Intake ManifoldTechnical FieldThis invention pertains to a mixing chamber positioned in a normal aspiration engine between the carburetor and the intake manifold. The primary object of the invention is to increase the degree of vaporization of gasoline introduced^ into the fuel-air mixture as it proceeds from the carbure¬ tor to the intake manifold. The device employs a splatter plate and a diffusion screen heating and agitating the fuel- air mixture as it proceeds through the device. The vacuum in the intake manifold draws hot air through the system from the exhaust manifold heating the interior of the mixing chamber, and the splatter plate, and the diffusion screen. This enhances the vaporization of the fuel in the fuel-air mixture. To further improve the vaporization in the device as a adjunct there may be employed a fuel tank vapor circuit which injects air into the fuel tank and withdraws vapor from fuel tank injecting the vapor into the chamber case between the carburetor and the intake manifold.Background ArtNumerous approaches have been utilized in efforts to obtain a homogenous fuel-air mixture entering the internal combustion engine. Various designs of intake manifolds partially accomplish this purpose. Super-chargers between the carburetors and intake manifolds are devices which have been utilized. High riser intake manifolds creating a plenum chamber between the carburetors and the intake ports of the engine operate in a similar fashion to the device of this invention. To the best of the knowledge of your applicant, -one of the nearest U. S. patents similar to the device of this invention is the patent to Butler, 4,068,638, which is also a device mounted between the carburetor and the intake manifold and utilizes heated coils in the fuel-air flow. rm ipo >
 to enhance the vaporization. Layers of metal balls are employed in Butler to agitate the fuelair mixture.Disclosure of the InventionThe device of this invention consists principally of a chamber case 10 which is positioned between carburetor 12 and the intake manifold 14. The device is constructed having a chamber case upper half 24 and a chamber case lowe half 26 which have the general configuration of inverted dishes cupped together forming an enclosed chamber. At the juncture of the two halves is secured a diffusion screen 30 projecting the maximum diameter of the chamber case and encases a splatter plate 28 positioned in the center of the diffusion screen 30. A hot air conduit 32 including a looped
