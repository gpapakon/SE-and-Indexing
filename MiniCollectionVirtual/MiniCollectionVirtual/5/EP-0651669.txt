<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a fire barrier device for installation in an opening in a wall to resist the passage therethrough, the fire barrier comprising a flexible curtain (2) formed from or comprising intumescent material; support means (7) for supporting the curtain at the upper end of said opening; and latch means (3, 4) for holding the curtain in a stowed configuration at the upper end of the opening; the latch means (3, 4) being connectable to, and actuable by, an associated fire or smoke detector, to release the latch means (3, 4), to allow the curtain (2) to unravel to close the opening; the curtain material being sufficiently intumescent to intumes in the present of heat to seal the opening against the passage of fire therethrough.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a fire barrier for sealing 
an opening in a wall against the passage of smoke and 
flames therethrough, in particular a fire barrier in form of a fire 
curtain. The large reception areas and foyers often found in 
large buildings such as office complexes, hotels, banks 
etc, are often divided into smaller units by means of 
partition walls, and typically openings are provided in 
such walls through which business can be conducted and 
people can communicate. A problem with such practice is 
that if fire breaks out in one part of the reception area 
or foyer, it can spread rapidly, and in a more or less 
unimpeded manner, to other parts of the reception area or 
foyer, since the individual units have hitherto tended not 
to be separated by means of reinforced fire-resistant doors 
and other physical barriers to the passage of fire. It is an object of this invention to overcome, or at 
least alleviate, this problem by providing a fire curtain 
which is arranged to descent to close an opening in the 
event of a fire. Several types of fire curtain are 
disclosed in FR-A-2287926. However, the fire curtains  
 
disclosed therein are in general of rather complex 
construction and comprise a double-skin structure formed 
from asbestos fabric within which are disposed a plurality 
of guide rods. The present invention relates to improvements in the 
construction of fire curtains. Accordingly, in a first aspect, the invention 
provides a fire barrier device for installation in an 
opening in a wall to resist the passage therethrough of 
fire, the fire barrier comprising a flexible curtain; 
support means for supporting the curtain at the upper end 
of said opening; and latch means for holding the curtain in 
a stowed configuration at the upper end of the opening, the 
curtain being stowed in a folded concertina form; the latch 
means being connectable to, and actuable by, an associated 
fire or smoke detector, to release the latch means, to 
allow the curtain to descend by free fall and unravel to 
close the opening; characterised in that the flexible 
curtain is formed from or comprises intumescent material 
and is sufficiently intumescent to intumesce in the 
presence of heat to seal the opening against the passage of 
fire therethrough when unravelled. The support means can take the form of a framework, 
e.g. of rectangular form, which lines the opening in a 
wall. Such a framework will typically comprise a base 
member, side walls and an upper frame member spanning the 
side walls.

<CLAIMS>
A fire barrier device for installation in an opening 
in a wall to resist the passage therethrough of fire, 

the fire barrier comprising a flexible curtain (2); 
support means (7,13,14,15) for supporting the curtain 

(2) at the upper end of said opening; and latch means 
(3,4,20) for holding the curtain (2) in a stowed 

configuration at the upper end of the opening, the 
curtain (2) being stowed in a folded concertina form; 

the latch means (3,4,20) being connectable to, and 
actuable by, an associated fire or smoke detector, to 

release the latch means (3,4,20), to allow the curtain 
(2) to descend by free fall and unravel to close the 

opening; characterised in that the flexible curtain 
(2) is formed from or comprises intumescent material 

and is sufficiently intumescent to intumesce in the 
presence of heat to seal the opening against the 

passage of fire therethrough when unravelled. 
A fire barrier device according to claim 1 wherein the 
support means takes the form of a framework (1) which 

lines the opening in a wall. 
A fire barrier device according to claim 2 wherein the 
support means is in the form of a rectangular 

framework (1) comprising a base member (5), side walls  
 

(6) and an upper frame member (7) spanning the side 
walls (6).
 
A fire barrier device according to claim 3 wherein the 
flexible curtain (2) is secured to the upper frame 

member (7). 
A fire barrier device according to claim 3 or 4 
wherein the side walls (6) of the framework (1) are 

configured so as to define channels which guide the 
curtain (2) as it descends to block the opening. 
A fire barrier device according to claim 5 wherein the 
channels are defined by the side walls (6) and 

inwardly directed flanges (10) extending from the 
upright edges thereof. 
A fire barrier device according to any one of the 
preceding claims wherein the curtain (2) is formed 

from a cloth impregnated with an intumescent substance 
or composition. 
A fire barrier according to any one of the preceding 
claims wherein the curtain (2) is provided with 

substantially horizontal fixed fold lines (24) of 
alternating direction of fold.  

 
A fire barrier device according to any one of the 
preceding claims wherein the curtain (2) is provided 

at its lower end with a weight (18) to assist its 
descent. 
A fire barrier according to claim 9 wherein the weight 
(18) is in the form of an elongate generally flat 

metal strip. 
A fire barrier device according to claim 10 wherein 
the underside of the elongate strip (18) and/or the 

upper surface of the opening or the base member of the 
framework are provided with cushioning means (19). 
A fire barrier device according to any one of the 
preceding claims wherein the lower end of the curtain 

is provided with a latching member (4,20) for 
engagement with a complimentary member (3) of the 

latch means. 
A fire barrier device according to any one of the 
preceding claims wherein the latching means (3,4,20) 

is in the form of an electromagnetic: latch (3,4) 
comprising an electromagnet secured to the support 

means or to an upper portion of the framework (1), and 
a complimentary latch member (4,20) secured to the 

lower end of the curtain (2), which latch member  
 

(4,20) is attracted and held by the electromagnet when 
the electromagnet is energised. 
A fire barrier device according to any one of the 
preceding claims wherein the latching means (3,4,20) 

is in the form of a solenoid having a plunger which, 
in the absence of smoke or fire, engages a suitable 

detent such as a recess or aperture in the 
complimentary latch member to hold the curtain in the 

raised position, but which upon receipt of a signal 
from the smoke/fire detection means, disengages from 

the detent to allow the curtain (2) to fall. 
A fire barrier device according to any one of the 
preceding claims which is provided with electrical 

connections enabling it to be connected to a source of 
power for the electromagnet or solenoid and to
