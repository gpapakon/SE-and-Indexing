<ABSTRACT>
A cleaning device for cleaning windows comprises an elongate wiper element (C) which is robotically controlled to move across the surface of the window to apply and remove cleaning fluid therefrom. The robotic control can be so arranged that the movement of the wiper element corresponds to that which it would follow if used manually by a skilled window cleaner.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the cleaning of windows and 
has for its objective the provision of an automatic 
means capable of cleaning windows of any size and 
inclination. The cleaning of a window involves washing, usually 
with water and detergent, followed by wiping to remove 
liquid. Manually this is typically achieved with a 
sponge wet with cleaning liquid followed by a flexible 
blade or squeegee. An automatic cleaning arrangement 
has been proposed wherein an elongate wiping blade of 
the dimensions of the window moves in a rectilinear 
path across the window. Such an arrangement has 
constructional and operational disadvantages. Other prior art automatic cleaning arrangements are described 
in FR-A-2647371 and FR-A-2662378. In accordance with the present invention there is 
provided a cleaning apparatus according to claim 1.  
 Preferably the robotic control means will initially 
act, using the blade as a sensing means, to sense the 
dimensions of the window to be cleaned. A computer 
will then establish the pattern of movements of the 
blade over the window. The wiping blade should have 
longitudinal compliance so that its ends can contact 
the window margin and be moved to actuate sensing 
means. Compliance normal to the blade length is also 
desirable to enable the blade to contact the window 
with the desired force. This compliance will 
preferably have two modes a first datum mode to sense 
by contact as set out above and a second stiffer 
cleaning mode. Although a cleaning head including the blade may 
comprise a liquid applicator, for example a jet or 
spray, separate from the wiping blade it is presently 
preferred to incorporate washing means such as a brush 
and the wiping blade in an elongate cleaning head. 
Preferably this head will include a vacuum space 
between the brush and blade for removing cleaning 
liquid during and particularly at the finish of 
cleaning. The robotic control means will be of any suitable form 
but we have found it possible to provide an effective 
cleaning pattern using a robot with Cartesian 
mountings, i.e. a robot which allows movement of the 
head in the three axes at right angles a horizontal 
lateral X axis, a Z axis normal to the X axis 
allowing horizontal movement towards and away from the 
window and a vertical Y axis. The cleaning head is 
rotatable about the Z axis to provide the full range 
of movements required with operational simplicity and 
robustness. The head may also be mounted for limited  
 
tilting movement to allow for inclination of

Cleaning apparatus for cleaning windows, 
comprising an elongate wiper element (C) and a robotic 

control means (40) operatively coupled to said wiper 
element to control movement of said wiper element 

across the surface area of the window, characterised 
in that said robotic control means (40) is 

specifically adapted to cause said wiper element (C) 
to make a continuous sweep across the entire surface 

area of a window to move a body of cleaning liquid 
across said window for ultimate disposal, whereby only 

one side of said wiper element contacts the cleaning 
liquid being removed. 
Cleaning apparatus according to claim 1, 
wherein the wiper is carried by a frame structure (36, 

38) which permits movement of the wiper element along the 
X-axis, 

the Y-axis, and the Z-axis of a Cartesian coordinate 
system. 
Cleaning apparatus according to claim 2, 
wherein the wiper element is also rotatable about a Z-axis. 
Cleaning apparatus according to any 
preceding claim, wherein the robotic control means 

(40) is arranged to initially act, using the wiper 
element (C) as a sensor, to sense the dimensions of 

the window to be cleaned. 
Cleaning apparatus according to claim 4, 
wherein the robotic control includes processing means 

(101) for establishing the pattern of movement to be  
 

followed by the wiper element during cleaning. 
Cleaning apparatus according to claims 4 and 
5, wherein the wiper element (C) is mounted so that it 

has longitudinal compliance whereby its end can 
contact a window margin and actuate sensing means. 
Cleaning apparatus according to claim 6, 
wherein the wiper element (C) is mounted so that it 

has compliance normal to its length whereby it can be 
arranged to contact the window with a desired force 

during cleaning. 
Cleaning apparatus according to claim 7, 
wherein the compliance has two modes, a first datum 

mode during which the window margins are sensed, and a 
second shifter mode during which cleaning occurs. 
Cleaning apparatus according to any preceding 
claim including a cleaning head (C) comprising a body, 

and an elongate cleaning portion (60, 62) carried by 
said body, said cleaning portion having projecting 

parts which when pressed into contact with a window 
form with the window a chamber, said body being formed 

with passages (64, 70) through which cleaning fluid 
can be applied to said chamber to clean said window. 
Cleaning apparatus according to claim 7, 
wherein said projecting portions are formed by an 

elongate cleaning brush (62) and an elongate wiper 
blade (60).
