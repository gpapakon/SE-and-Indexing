<ABSTRACT>
In the production of plastics granules, a granulation water tank equipped with screening devices for fines separation is required in order to prepare the cooling water for reuse. The aim of the invention is a space-saving design of the water tank and prevention of damage to the fines screen when a stream of water charged with starting granules and/or agglomerates is fed to the tank. This is achieved by the inlet opening (2) for the stream of water being arranged on the tank (1). Arranged underneath the inlet opening (2) is a screen (4) with an adjoining granules transporting container (6), as the first level, and arranged at a distance underneath is a run-in plate (5) with adjoining screening device (7), as the second level, passing through the water tank (1). Each level is assigned an outlet (9, 15) with a common chute (17).

Granulator water tank with fine slurry separation for reception of the water flow
occurring in a dewatering plant for synthetic material granulate, with an inlet opening (2),

which is arranged in the upper region of the tank and is aligned with a horizontally
arranged sieve equipment (7), for the water flow, which filter equipment is flowed through

by the water flow and - seen in flow direction has at its end a slurry separation
equipment, and with an outlet opening, which is arranged below the water level in the

proximity of the tank base and is connected with a pump, for the clarified water,

characterised thereby that the inlet opening (2) together with an inflow regulating element
(3), which is associated therewith and is connected by way of a conically tapering

superstructure (21) with a feed stub pipe (22) for the water flow, is arranged at one end on
the granulator water tank (1) to span over the tank width, wherein arranged under the inlet

opening (2) in the granulator water tank (1) is an arcuate sieve (4) which extends out from
one end wall (1a) and is connected to a granulate transport box (6) (1st plane), which

engages through the granulator water tank length and is connected with a granulate outlet
(9) provided at the opposite end wall (1b), wherein the sieve equipment (7) is arranged at

a spacing thereunder as a second plane and reaches from an inflow plate (5) to a slurry
outlet (15) provided at the opposite end wall (1b).
Granulator water tank according to claim 1, characterised thereby that the inflow
regulating element (3) consists of a flap (33) which is adjustable by means of a lever (34),

is fastened to a shaft (31) borne in the side walls (1c) of the tank (1) and is guided at both
sides and in its pivot region by way of vertical walls (32) arranged on the sieve (4).
Granulator water tank according to claim 1, characterised thereby that several
nozzles (13) chargeable with circulating water are arranged in the end wall (1a) at the

height of the water level (5), and an overflow gutter (8) is arranged opposite these and in
front of the end wall (1b) and is connected by way of a duct (83), which is provided with a

pump (82), with a return feed (84) arranged above the granulate transport box (6).
Granulator water tank according to one or ore of claims 1 to 3, characterised
thereby that at least one counter spray device (11) is arranged below the sieve equipment

(7).
