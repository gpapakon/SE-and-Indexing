<ABSTRACT>
A tool (20) is adapted to remove and insert link 
pins from and into joints connecting adjacent links of 

a chain. The chain components are positioned at an 
operative region (26) at which they are supported 

against plastics deformation whilst a punch (34) 
mounted on a movable carrier (36) is used to remove or 

insert a link pin. 
 
An angling post (54) induces an angle between the 
chain components such that the free outer link plate at 

a joint is preferably supported against plastic 
deformation by contact with its adjacent inner link 

plate. A retention member (60) helps to retain the 
chain components at the operative region (26) . An 

orientation post, receivable between the outer link 
plates at a joint, ensures that the joint can only be 

positioned at the operative region (26) in one 
orientation and the width of the jaw of the operative 

region (26) ensures that a joint can only be positioned 
at one site. A storage recess (68) with a removable 

cap (70) may be used to retain a spare link pin or 
rivet for a chain. 
 
To be accompanied when published by Figure 2 of 
the drawings.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the assembly and 
disassembly of chains, particularly, though not 
exclusively, roller chains. More particularly, this 
invention relates to the extraction or insertion of a 
coupling, link pin or rivet used to secure together 
adjacent links of a chain. Tools for inserting or extracting chain rivets 
have been known for some time and one example of such a 
tool is described in British Patent No. 912 703. In 
order to extract a rivet from a chain using this tool a 
joint of the chain is located in the jaw of the tool 
and the rivet to be extracted is aligned with an 
advancible punch which may be used to push the rivet 
through and out of the link. Insertion of a rivet 
follows a similar procedure except that the links are 
introduced to a different anvil, the punch being used 
to push the rivet into a link. When a chain is in use it is important that 
adjacent links can rotate freely about a joint. To 
provide for this movement, chain links are typically 
constructed such that there is a clearance gap between 
the outer link plates and the inner link plates of the 
respective links at each joint. One of the 
disadvantages of the aforementioned tool is that both 
during extraction and insertion of a rivet the inner 
and outer link plates at a joint are forced together as 
the rivet is forced through the respective link 
plates. Consequently, when adjacent links are 
disassembled or assembled using this tool the resulting 
joint is often too stiff to function properly, the 
outer link plates having been deformed inwards to lie 
against, and in some cases, to grip the inner link  
 
plates. This problem is currently alleviated by using 
the aforementioned tool in a different mode to deform 
the outer link plates to re-introduce a clearance gap. Prior art tools have suffered from a disadvantage 
of initially deforming the links of a chain and of 
subsequently requiring a separate operation to 
reintroduce a clearance gap into a deformed link to 
permit the chain to function correctly. In addition, 
in some tools it is easy to mis-position a chain within 
the tool and consequently to risk damaging the chain, 
the tool, or both when attempting to extract or insert 
a rivet. It is an aim of the present invention to provide 
an improved method of, and tool for, extracting or 
inserting a rivet or link pin from or into a joint of a 
chain. According to a first aspect of the invention, 
there is provided a tool adapted to extract and/or 
insert a coupling from or into a joint connecting

A tool (20) adapted to extract and/or insert a 
coupling (16) from or into a joint (10) connecting 

first and second chain components (4, 6), the tool (20) 
comprising drive means (34, 36) adapted to displace the 

coupling and the chain components relative to each 
other and characterised in that support

second chain components (4, 6) at an operative 

region (26) of the tool such that when the 
coupling (16) is being driven from through or into the 

joint (10), each chain component (4, 6) at that joint 
is supported against plastic deformation.
