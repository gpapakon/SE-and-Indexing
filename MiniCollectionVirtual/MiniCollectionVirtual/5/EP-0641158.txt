<ABSTRACT>
A flooring system consists of a number of frames (1) equipped with a toothing (9, 10) on opposite lateral edges (7, 8). The toothing consists of teeth (12, 13) connected, at each tip, with a downward lateral wall (19) which delimits a U-shaped track (11). The lateral wall (19) is, at its upper side, projected from either side of the tip of the tooth (20) so that surfaces (21) pointing upwards are formed. These surfaces may be used as contact surfaces for engagement under the roots (22) of teeth of an adjacent grate (1). Due to the engagement of the contact surfaces (21), a grate will not be able to loosen unintendedly from a floor, and consequently such a flooring system will be particularly well suited for use in pigsties.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a flooring system, mainly for supports 
for farm animals in stables, consisting of plate-shaped frames, 
preferably grates, which have crossing longitudinal and transverse 
ribs, one pair of opposite lateral edges of a frame being equipped 
with horizontal connecting means, and the other pair of opposite lateral 
edges being equipped with toothings which are able to interact 
with corresponding toothings on the lateral edge of an adjacent frame, 
and which toothing comprises a U-shaped track pointing downwards for 
placing in a supporting rail so that the frames are able, when placed 
adjacently, to form a flooring with an unbroken surface and at the 
same time are connected horizontally and vertically. Such flooring is known from the German Gebrauchsmuster 8009170.9. The 
floorings disclosed therein are made up of frames which are equipped 
with a toothing on one pair of opposite sides. The spaces and tips of 
the toothings are equipped with recesses and corbels in order to form 
an almost unbroken surface, so that it will be nearly impossible to 
take out an individual frame from the centre of a constructed floor. 
This is important when the frames are used in buildings for farm animals. Another flooring is described in EP-A-0.472.206. The flooring system 
disclosed therein describes a frame which is equipped with toothings 
offset from one another on opposite sides. Each toothing is on the tip 
provided with a bead forming an anti scid flooring system. This 
flooring system does not describe means to make it almost impossible 
to take out an individual frame in the centre of a constructed 
flooring, and the molding form and procedure is disadvantageous 
because of the amount of material at the tip of the tooth making the 
bead. It is the object of the present invention to provide a flooring of the 
type mentioned initially, which presents the same advantages, and 
which provides an improved safety against unintended removal of a 
frame from the centre of the floor, and which is at the same time easy 
to produce in a moulding form.  
 According to the present invention this is obtained by a flooring 
which is characterized in that said downward track is delimited by the 
under side of each projected tooth and two lateral walls, the first of 
which consisting in a downward wall which is connected to the tip of 
each tooth and which is perpendicular to the tooth, 
and the second lateral wall consisting in the lateral faces of the 
frame or in flanges which are projecting

A flooring system, mainly for supports for farm animals in stables, 
consisting of plate-shaped frames (1), preferably grates, which have 

crossing longitudinal and transverse ribs (2,3), one pair of opposite 
lateral edges (4,5) of a frame (1) being equipped with horizontal connecting 

means (6), and the other pair of opposite lateral edges (7,8) 
being equipped with toothings (9,10) which are able to interact with 

corresponding toothings (9,10) on the lateral edge of an adjacent 
frame, and which toothing comprises a U-shaped track (11) pointing 

downwards for placing in a supporting rail so that the frames (1) are 
able, when placed adjacently, to form a flooring with an unbroken surface 

and at the same time are connected horizontally and vertically, 

characterized
 in that said downward track (11) is delimited 
by the under side (14) of each projected tooth (12,13) and two 

lateral walls (17,19), the first of which (19) consisting in a downward 
wall (18) which is connected to the tip (20) of each tooth and 

which is perpendicular to the tooth (12,13), 
and the second lateral wall (17) consisting in the lateral faces (17) 

of the frame (1) or in flanges (16) which are projecting from such a 
lateral face (17), and that said first lateral wall (19), at the end 

facing the tip of the tooth (20), extends beyond the tip of the tooth 
(20) in a direction parallel with the track (11). 
A flooring system according to claim 1, 
characterized
 
in that the first lateral wall (19) is tapered downwards, in the direction extending 

away from the tip of the tooth (12,13). 
A flooring system according to claim 2, 
characterized
 
in that the downward tapering extends according to one angle at the 

lower portion of the lateral wall (24) and according to a wider angle 
at the upper portion of the lateral wall (25) which joins the tip of 

the tooth, the angle being measured according to a vertical axis of 
symmetry (26) through the lateral wall (19). 
A flooring system according to any one of the preceding claims, 

characterized
 in that each of the lateral edges (18) of 
the lateral wall (19) which extends downward from the sides of the tip 

of the tooth inclines in proportion to a plane of symmetry through the  
 

lateral wall so that said lateral wall (19) has a larger extension 
towards the track (11) than away from the track. 
A flooring system according to any one of the preceding claims, 

characterized
 in that each tooth (12), as seen perpendicular 
to the surface of the flooring, tapers rectilinearly towards 

the tip of the tooth. 
A flooring system according to any one of the preceding claims, 

characterized
 in that the frames (1) consist of moulded 
resins. 
A flooring system according to any one of the preceding claims, 

characterized
 in that the under side (14) of each projected 
tooth (12,13) is tightened by ribs (15) which form the 

del imitation of the track (11). 
A flooring system according to any one of the preceding claims, 

characterized
 in that the downward edge (29) of each 
first lateral wall (19) is bevelled (30) towards the track (11).
