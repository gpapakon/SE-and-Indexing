<ABSTRACT>
A leakage detection method in an automatic pipetting apparatus for objectively judging leakage by measuring an internal 
pressure of a pump connected to a nozzle tip. At Step 202, distilled water (90) is sucked, and when an internal pressure P₁ of a 

pump after completion of suction is near the atmospheric pressure, leakage is identified. At Step 203, the tip (36) is kept at 
halt for 30 seconds, for example, without allowing it to rise after the internal pressure P₁ of the pump after completion of 

suction is measured at Step 202. The internal pressure P₂ of the pump is again measured by a pressure sensor. When this internal 
pressure P₂ is different from the internal pressure P₁ previously measured, leakage is identified. Further, at Step 204, 

sucked distilled water (90) is discharged into the same test tube (62), and the internal pressure of the pump is monitored by 
the pressure sensor. If any sharp fluctuation of the internal pressure is found, leakage is judged. When leakage is detected, 

leakage detection measurement is terminated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of
detecting leakage in an automatic pipetting
apparatus, and more particularly to a method
comprising the
features of the preamble portion of claim 1.A pipetting apparatus for pipetting a sample
is well known. The pipetting apparatus is used to
pipet the blood serum or plasma obtained from
blood of a human body into several receptacles,
for instance.The sample can be aspirated by a disposable
nozzle tip, for instance. In order to pipette the
sample by predetermined volume accurately, the
volume of aspirated sample must be accurate. In
the conventional pipetting apparatus, however,
there is a case that leakage occurs at any of 
junction portions in the sample aspiration passage
from the nozzle tip to a pump through a pressure
sensor, in particular at the fitting portion
between the disposable tip and the nozzle base,
due to contamination or wear at the nozzle base.
Therefore, there is a case that it is impossible
to aspirate the sample accurately, so that the
volume of the dispensed sample becomes not
sufficient, thus raising a problem in that the
pipetting accuracy is deteriorated.In order to overcome this problem, in the
conventional pipetting apparatus, the presence or
absence of the leakage has been so far checked
visually by the operator twice a day, for instance
in the morning before use of the apparatus and in
the evening after use thereof. In this case, the
apparatus is stopped temporarily after the nozzle
tip into which the sample has been aspirated is
moved upward away from the liquid surface, and the
operator checks by visual inspection whether the
sample drops from the nozzle tip by the gravity
thereof.In this prior art method, however, since the 
operator must watch the nozzle tip for about 30
sec to 2 min continuously in front of the
apparatus, there are problems in that this
checking work is troublesome and in addition it is
difficult to check the sample leakage
quantitatively, because of its large dependence
upon the operator's experience or of the lack of
objectivity. In the case where the leakage is
slight, in particular, it may be possible to
maintain a pipetting accuracy without susceptible
to the influence of leakage, by dispensing the
sample into the receptacles immediately after the
sample aspiration. Therefore, it has been
difficult for the operator to judge the degree of
allowable leakage.A method as mentioned above is known from EP-A2-341 438.The object of
the present invention is to provide a method for
detecting leakage in an

<CLAIMS>
A method for detecting leakage in an automatic pipetting apparatus (30) including a
nozzle tip (36) for aspirating and dis
pensing a liquid sample, an aspirating and
dispensing pump (47) having a cylinder connected to the nozzle tip and a piston, and

a pressure sensor for detecting inner pressure of the pump, wherein an inner pump
pressure is monitored by a pressure sensor, 
characterized by
a first liquid sample leakage detecting step of comparing a first inner pump pressure
(P1) detected by the pressure sensor with atmospheric pressure after sample

aspiration;
a second liquid sample leakage detecting step of comparing the first inner pump
pressure (P1) with a second inner pump pressure (P2) detected by the pressure

sensor at a predetermined time after detection of said first inner pump pressure; and
a third liquid sample leakage detecting step of dispensing the liquid sample aspirated
by the nozzle tip, monitoring further the inner pump pressure by the pressure sensor

with the lapse of time, and detecting an abrupt change in the inner pump pressure to
determine leakage caused when volume of the aspirated liquid sample decreases

from a predetermined aspirated volume due to leakage.
Method according to claim 1, wherein a determination that there is a leakage is made
in said first step when the inner pump pressure (P1) is roughly equal to atmospheric

pressure.
Method according to claim 1 or 2, wherein a determination that there is no leakage is
made in the second step when the second inner pump pressure (P2) is roughly equal

to the first inner pump pressure (P1).
Method according to claim 2, wherein pressure measurement is ended when leakage
is determined in said first step.
Method according to claim 3 or 4, wherein pressure measurement is ended when
leakage is determined in said second step.
