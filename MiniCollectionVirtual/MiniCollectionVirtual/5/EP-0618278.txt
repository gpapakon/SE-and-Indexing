<ABSTRACT>
An ink for ink-jet recording is provided which 
contains a coloring material and an aqueous liquid 

medium for solving or dispersing the coloring material, 

the liquid medium having a lower critical consolute 
temperature (Tc) to cause phase separation at a 

temperature in the range of from 40 to 100째C. Ink-jet 
recording method and an ink-jet recording apparatus 

employing the above ink are also provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink-jet
recording method according to the preamble of claim 1 and
an ink according to the preamble of claim 4.
More specifically,
the present invention relates to an ink which realizes
high-quality recording with excellent fixation of the
ink on plain paper such as wood-free paper, copying
paper, letter paper, heat-transfer paper, business form
paper for wire-dot printing, and also to an ink-jet
recording method employing the above ink.The present invention also relates to an
apparatus charged with the above ink.Conventionally for ink-jet recording, an
aqueous ink is used which comprises a water-soluble dye
and an aqueous medium for dissolving the dye. The ink
for ink-jet recording is required:
(1) to give sufficient density of an image,(2) to dry quickly on a recording medium,(3) to cause less bleeding of recorded images,(4) not to cause flow-out even when the image is
brought into contact with water or alcohol,(5) to form recorded images having sufficient light-fastness, (6) not to clog an ink nozzle,(7) not to cause inconvenience such as blurring of a
recorded image during continuous recording or after
interruption of recording for a long time,(8) to be stable in storage, and(9) to be safe for persons handling the ink,
In ink-jet recording utilizing thermal energy,
the ink is further required:(10) to have sufficient thermal stability, and to give
no adverse effect to a thermal energy-generating means.These requirements cannot all be satisfied
simultaneously with conventional material constitution
of ink-jet recording inks. Therefore, conventional
inks do not necessarily satisfy the recent requirements
for the performance of inks.Most of conventional inks, which are composed
of a water-soluble dye, water, and a water-soluble
organic solvent, involve a particularly difficult
problem of inconsistency of printed image quality with
ink fixability. In recent years, solid jet technique
has been put to practical use. In this technique, a
solid ink is liquefied at ejection, and the ink medium
itself solidifies after the ejection, thereby achieving
extremely quick fixation of ink. Therefore this
technique gives high quality of recorded images
independently of the kind of recording paper used. The 
solid ink, however, has disadvantages that the life of
a recording head is adversely affected by required head
temperature as high as 100째C; much power is consumed
for maintaining the head temperature; and the apparatus
is necessarily large in size. Furthermore, the
practical use
