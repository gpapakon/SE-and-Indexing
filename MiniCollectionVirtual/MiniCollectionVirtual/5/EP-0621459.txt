<ABSTRACT>
A map-reading electronic compass (10) comprising an 
electromagnetic sensor (50) for detecting the 

instantaneous heading of the compass (10) with respect 
to magnetic North, an electronic memory (52) for 

recording the angular difference between map denoted 
North and geographical North when the compass 10 is 

placed in any given position on the map (2) and a ROM 
(56) for converting bearings taken over the ground and 

from the map (2) by calculation using said angular 
differences, a LCD display (14) for displaying visual 

indica related to this conversion.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a map-reading electronic 
compass for use in navigation. In this field it is already known that when utilising a 
conventional magnetic needle compass to guide a person 
or vehicle along a straight-line route following a 
predetermined bearing, e.g. point to point, it is 
necessary first to determine the heading of the 
intended route, ie. the deviation of the route from 
magnetic North. This may be done by noting the intended route on a map, 
and directly measuring the inclination of the route 
line from magnetic North as denoted on the map. The 
person or vehicle then carries the compass and proceeds 
in a direction which keeps the compass needle pointing 
at an angle equal and opposite to the predetermined 
deviation of the mapped route from magnetic North. Examples of such conventional compasses are described 
in Swiss Patent Application No 598,572 and French 
Patent Application No 7829043.  These conventional compasses have the disadvantage in 
that a compass employing a magnetic needle for 
determining the direction of magnetic North suffers the 
inherent disadvantages of all forms of portable 
instrumentation having moving parts, compounded by the 
delicacy of the pivot necessary for mounting a magnetic 
needle. To obviate this, electronic compasses having 
little or no moving parts have been developed. 
Examples of compasses such as this are described in US 
Patent 4,482,255, UK Patent Application GB 2,242,027A 
and European Patent Application No 0,280,546. In these examples of the prior art, in order to 
determine the correct direction in which to travel from 
a map, the compass user must adjust the reading to 
compensate for the discrepancy between geographical 
North and magnetic North. In hitherto known map-reading 
compasses this may be done by rotating a 360 
degree incremental bezel clockwise 5 degrees and 30 
minutes (UK 1990). However, difficulty arises in the compass user's 
ability to conduct this operation accurately to within 
plus or minus 1 degree. The general inaccuracy of 
mechanical compasses being further compounded by the 
compass user's judgement and eyesight, the precision of 
the bezel and by an annual shift of magnetic North 
relative to geographical North. According to the present invention there is provided a 
map-reading electronic compass, comprising 
electromagnetic North-sensing means for detecting the 
instantaneous heading of the compass with respect to 
magnetic North, recording means for use with the 
compass placed on a map held in any

<CLAIMS>
A map-reading electronic compass, comprising 
electromagnetic North-sensing means for detecting the 

instantaneous heading of the compass with respect to 
magnetic North, recording means for use with the 

compass placed on a map held in any given position to 
record the angular difference between map North in that 

position and geographical North, calculator means for 
converting between bearings over the ground and map 

bearings by calculation using said angular difference, 
and display means for displaying visual indicia related 

to said conversion. 
A compass according to claim 1, in which said 
recording means includes means operable by a user when 

the compass is aligned with map North and when the 
compass is aligned with a desired route to cause the 

angular difference between North and the desired route 
to be stored. 
A compass according to claim 2, in which the display 
means displays information indicating the divergence of 

the compass heading from the desired route. 
A compass according to claim 2 or claim 3, in which 
the recording means can be operated to store a 

plurality of sequential route headings. 
A compass according to any preceding claim, in which 
said recording means includes means operable by a user 

when sighting one or more objects to record the 
bearing(s) of the object(s) from the user's position. 
A compass according to claim 5, in which the display 
 

means subsequently displays information indicating the 
divergence of the compass from map North to enable said 

bearing(s) to be plotted on the map. 
A compass according to any preceding claim, in which 
the display means comprises left, right and ahead 

directional indicators. 
A compass according to claim 7, in which the display 
means additionally comprises a digital readout in 

compass degrees. 
A compass according to any preceding claim, 
including means providing correction for local magnetic 

variation. 
A compass according to any preceding claim, in 
which the North-sensing means comprises a fluxgate. 
A compass according to any preceding claim, 
incorporating one or more of a chronometer, an 

altimeter, and a thermometer each providing information 
on the display means at the command of the user. 
A compass according to any preceding claim, 
contained within a hand-held casing of generally flat 

rectangular shape and having a removable transparent 
portion provided with guide lines to aid in aligning 

the compass on a map.
