<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an oriented, heat-sealable polypropylene film having an improved water vapour barrier action at the same time as considerably reduced global migration for packaging purposes, and having the layer structure ABCBA, where   a) C is a base layer comprising polypropylene and a hydrocarbon resin with a molecular weight of up to about 2000 g/mol and a softening point of above 130@, b) B are two hydrocarbon resin-free jacket layers of highly isotactic polypropylene having an isotacticity of 
>
 94%, where the ratio between the thickness of a jacket layer and the thickness of the base layer is between 0.01 and 0.1, and c) A are two top layers of a heat-sealable polyolefin copolymer or terpolymer, where these top layers contain at least one antiblocking agent, lubricant and antistatic.

<CLAIMS>
An oriented, in particular biaxially oriented,
sealable polypropylene film having an improved

barrier action to water vapour together with a
considerably reduced global migration and which is

intended for packaging purposes, characterized in
that it has the following structure:

   A B C B A

a) wherein C is a base layer of polypropylene and
a hydrocarbon resin having a molecular weight of

up to about 2,000 g/mol and a softening point
above 130°C,
b) wherein B represents jacket layers, which are
free from hydrocarbon resin, of highly isotactic

polypropylene having an isotacticity 
>
94%, the
ratio of the thickness of the jacket layer to

the thickness of the base layer being between
0.01 and 0.1, and
c) wherein A represents two surface layers of a
heat-sealable polyolefin co- or terpolymer, said

surface layers comprise at least one
antiblocking agent, a lubricant and an

antistatic agent.
A sealable film according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the base layer C comprises a hydrocarbon

resin from the group consisting of petroleum resins,
terpene resins or coal tar resins. 
A sealable film according to claim 2, characterized in
that the hydrocarbon resin is a hydrogenated

oligomeric cyclopentadiene resin.
A sealable film according to claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the surface layers A

substantially comprise

random propylene/ethylene copolymers
random propylene/1-butene copolymers
random propylene/ethylene/olefin terpolymers
mixtures of two or three of the above polymers.
A sealable film according to claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the surface layers comprise

silicon dioxide, calcium carbonate, polymethyl
methacrylate, polycarbonate, silicone or HDPE (high-density

polyethylene) as the antiblocking agent.
A sealable film according to claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the base layer C and/or the

surface layers A comprise a lubricant.
A sealable film according to claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that the base layer C and/or the

surface layers A comprise an antistatic agent.
A film according to one of claims 1 to 7, characterized
in that it is pretreated on one or both sides by

corona, flame, plasma or fluorine pretreatment.
Use of the sealable film according to one or more of
claims 1 to 8 as a packaging material.
