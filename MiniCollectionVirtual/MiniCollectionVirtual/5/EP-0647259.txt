<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of a component
based on 1,3-dioxane compounds, especially 1,3-dioxane
alcohols, and derivatives thereof in lubricant and release
agents. This invention also relates to a lubricant and
release agent based on or containing 1,3-dioxane compounds
as above.Lubricant and release agents are normally used in connection
with metal cutting, tapping, threading, reaming etc.
as well as for concrete casting. Further and frequent
application areas include utensils and plants for refrigeration,
air conditioners, jet and conventional combustion
engines, hydraulic fluids and the like.Above exemplified application areas most often involve
lubricant and release agents based on or containing mineral
oils and one or more property adjusting additives such as
EP-additives (EP = Extreme Pressure). EP-additives are mostly
based on chloric, sulphuric and/or phosphatic compounds of the
paraffin type.Products containing mineral oils give rise to oil mist with
pendant oil-polluted air and oil coated equipments in and
around a working area. Mineral oils and for instance EP-additives
are furthermore known to cause skin irritation,
eczema and/or allergic reactions. Carcinogenic effects can
not be excluded, as most mineral oils contain for example
aromatic hydrocarbons of the benzopyrene type, which compounds
at high working temperatures most probably form carcinogenic
polyaromatics.Mineral oils as well as chloric, sulphuric and/or phosphatic
compounds give also rise to undesirable ecological effects, 
such as gradual concentration of undesired compounds like
chlorine, sulphur and/or phosphorous in soil and water.
Furthermore, mineral oils are not or only to a very low
extent biodegradable, while the component according to
the invention per se is biodegradable and based on biodegradable
substances.Mineral oils have per se a limited lubricating and releasing
power, why a number of additives must be admixed. Besides
property adjusting additives must for instance waterborne
emulsions of mineral oils and synthetic lubricants comprise
compounds such as emulsifiers and biocides, which compounds
may irritate the skin and/or the respiratory passage.According to the present invention, it has surprisingly been
possible to solve above discussed problems by a replacement
of mineral oils and/or property adjusting additives with a
component based on 1,3-dioxane compounds and/or derivatives
thereof.The lubricating properties have furthermore been improved
by utilisation of the component as additive in
