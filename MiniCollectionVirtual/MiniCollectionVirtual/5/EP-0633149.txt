<ABSTRACT>
In order to obtain, in use, reduced acoustic emissions, the position of the actual point of contact P of the wheel (1) with the rail is determined, the distribution of masses of the cross-section of the rim (4) and of the disc (3) of the wheel (1) are adjusted so that the point of contact P, the centre of inertia G1 of the cross-section of the rim (4) and the centre of inertia G2 of the cross-section of the disc (3) are located on one and the same straight line (XX') perpendicular to the axis (YY') and the trace (track) of the cross-section of the wheel (1) is adjusted so that the point P is a vibration node for the axial vibration modes of the wheel rim (4). The invention applies in particular to wheels for high speed trains.

Method for determining the plot of the section through a 
plane passing through its rotational axis (YY') of a wheel for 

a rail vehicle (1) and notably of a railway wheel with low 
noise emission of the type comprising a hub (2), a web (3) and 

a rim (4) forming a flange (6) and a running surface (7) whose 
shape is imposed, designed to be used on a rail network 

consisting of rails having a profile determined and set 
according to the rules of the rail network, in which there is 

determined, from the axle loading of the vehicle, the nominal 
speed and the braking conditions of the vehicle, an optimised 

plot of the section of the wheel (1) through the axial plane, 
characterised in that, to achieve in service the lowest 

possible noise emission from the wheel (1), 

the position is determined, in a manner known per se, on the 
running surface (7), of the actual point of contact P of the 

wheel (1) with a rail on which the wheel (1) rests when in 
service, from the imposed shape of the running surface (7), 

the profile of the rail and the laying conditions of the rail, 
the distribution of the weights of the section of the rim 
(4) and of the web is adjusted so that the point of contact P, 

the centre of inertia G1 of the section of the rim (4) and the 
centre of inertia G2 of the section of the body (3) are to be 

found on the same straight line (XX') perpendicular to the 
axis (YY') of the wheel (1), and 
the plot of the section of the wheel is again adjusted so 
that the point P is a vibration node for the axial vibration 

modes of the rim (4) of the wheel (1) in service.
