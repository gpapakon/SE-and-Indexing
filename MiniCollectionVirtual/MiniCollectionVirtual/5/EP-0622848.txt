<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a chip-type circuit
component comprising a pair of substrates and a thin film circuit
pattern which is formed on at least one of opposite surfaces of
the substrates, and a method of manufacturing the same.Examples of a chip-type circuit component comprising
substrates and thin film circuit patterns which are formed on
surfaces thereof are an inductance component, a band-pass
filter, a high-frequency coil and a transformer. Such a
conventional chip-type circuit component is formed by stacking a
plurality of substrates which are provided with thin film
circuit patterns with each other. For example, an inductance
component is manufactured by forming a magnetic layer by
printing paste which is mainly composed of ferrite, or preparing
a green sheet which is mainly composed of ferrite, printing metal
powder paste on the magnetic layer for forming a circuit pattern
for inductance, stacking a plurality of such magnetic layers
with each other for integrating the same, and firing the laminate
as formed.In such a method of manufacturing an inductance component, 
however, fine patterns cannot be obtained since the circuit
patterns for inductance are formed by printing, and the .
inductance component is restricted in miniaturization since the
degree of integration cannot be improved. Further, the laminate
of the magnetic layers is fired at a temperature of about 1000°C
and hence cracking or breaking is caused in shrinkage of the
magnetic layers. When the paste layers for forming the
inductance circuit patterns are increased in thickness in order
to reduce conductor resistance, evaporation of a solvent
contained in the paste is increased to cause delamination
between the magnetic layers during firing.When the inductance component is integrally fired with
paste or a green sheet consisting of a different ceramics
material to be integrated with a capacitor component, further,
substrates may be separated from each other at bonding surfaces
therebetween due to reaction during firing or difference in rate
of shrinkage. An electrical component having a substrate and a plurality of VLSI radiation
hardened chips affixed thereto by means of a non-conductive die attach
material is known from EP-A-0 461 316.In particular, the substrate has a recess the bottom of which is covered by a
conductive layer that extends to the edge portion of the upper surface. VSLI
chips are disposed in the recess on the conductive layer and are affixed to
this layer by means of a non-conductive adhesive. This adhesive
