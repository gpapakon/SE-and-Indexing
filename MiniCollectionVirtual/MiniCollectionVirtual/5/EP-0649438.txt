<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved process for increasing the 
viscosity of copolymers containing interpolymerized units of ethylene, 
unsaturated acids, and unsaturated esters. Copolymers of ethylene with alpha, beta-unsaturated acids and 
unsaturated esters are well-known in the art and a large number of such 
copolymers are available commercially, for example ethylene/methyl 
acrylate/methacrylic acid and ethylene/vinyl acetate/acrylic acid 
copolymers. In the past one of the problems associated with continuous 
processes for preparation of such compositions in stirred tank reactors was 
the tendency for large amounts of polymeric deposits to form on the inner 
walls of the reactors. This buildup, which consists of highly crosslinked, 
insoluble polymer, i.e. gel, adversely affected operation of the reactor. In 
addition, particles of the gel were invariably introduced into the product 
which tended to compromise the quality of the copolymer produced. It has 
recently been found that this problem can be alleviated by performing the 
copolymerization in the presence of small amounts of methanol or acetone, 
as disclosed in U.S. Patents 5,028,674 and 5,057,593. Due to the chain 
transfer activity of methanol and acetone, however, in some cases the 
polymeric products thus obtained are of extremely low viscosity, so low in 
fact that they are unsuitable for many applications. A highly effective process for increasing viscosity of such copolymers 
is disclosed in co-pending U.S. patent application 07/769,603 whereby a free 
radical generating agent is added to the copolymer in an amount sufficient to 
decrease its melt index to 0.1-15g/10 minutes while producing a copolymer 
product having a gel content of less than 3%, as determined by measurement 
of % insolubles in boiling xylene. The process thus provides a method for 
increasing viscosity without concomitantly raising the gel content of the 
polymer or producing products which contain domains of highly crosslinked 
gel within the polymer matrix.  
 Under certain circumstances however, free radical generating agents 
can have deleterious effects on the physical properties of the product, for 
example decrease in tensile and tear strengths. In order to mitigate these 
effects it would therefore be desirable to employ a method to increase raw 
polymer viscosity which minimizes the amount of free radical generating 
agent used. EP-A-0 004 442 discloses a process for improving the green strength 
in elastomeric terpolymers derived from ethylene,
