<ABSTRACT>
A CVD diamond die for drawing wire has top and bottom surfaces 
and opposing portions of a peripheral side located in respective 

regions of larger diamond smaller diamond grains. An opening 
which extends through the body from the top surface to the bottom 

surface is suitable positioned intermediate the side portions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to diamond wire dies.Wires of metals such as tungsten, copper, iron, molybdenum,
and stainless steel are produced by drawing the metals through
diamond dies. Single crystal diamond dies are difficult to fabricate,
tend to chip easily, easily cleave, and often fail catastrophically
because of the extreme pressures involved during wire drawing.With reference to single crystal wire dies, it is reported in
Properties and Applications of Diamond, Wilks et al, Butterworth-Heinemann
Ltd 1991, pages 505-507: "The best choice of
[crystallographic] direction is not too obvious because as the wire
passes through the die its circumference is abrading the diamond on
a whole 360° range of planes, and the rates of wear on these planes
will be somewhat different. Hence, the originally circular hole will
not only grow larger but will loose its shape. However, 〈110〉
directions offer the advantage that the wire is abrading the sides of
the hole with {001} and {011} orientations in abrasion resistant
directions."Diamond dies which avoid some of the problems attendant
with natural diamonds of poorer quality comprise microporous
masses compacted from tiny crystals of natural or synthesized
diamonds or from crystals of diamond. The deficiencies of such
polycrystalline hard masses, as indicated in U.S. patent 4,016,736,
are due to the presence of micro-voids/pores and soft inclusions.
These voids and inclusions can be more than 10 microns in diameter.
The improvement of the patent utilizes a metal cemented carbide
jacket as a source of flowable metal which fills the voids resulting in
an improved wire die. European Patent Application 0 494 799 A1 describes a
polycrystalline CVD diamond layer having a hole formed
therethrough and mounted in a support. As set forth in column 2,
lines 26-30, "The relatively random distribution of crystal orientations
in the CVD diamond ensures more even wear during use of the
insert." As set forth in column 3, lines 50-54, "The orientation of the
diamond in the polycrystalline CVD diamond layer 10 may be such
that most of the crystallites have a (111) crystallographic axis in the
plane, i.e. parallel to the surfaces 14,16, of the layer 10.Other crystal orientations for CVD films are known. U.S.
patent 5,110,579 to Anthony et al describes a transparent
polycrystalline diamond film as illustrated in Figure 3A, substantially
transparent columns of diamond crystals having a 〈110〉 orientation
perpendicular to the base.Because of its high purity and uniform consistency,

<CLAIMS>
A die for drawing wire of a predetermined diameter comprising a
CVD diamond body characterised in that said body

being of the type including a region of larger diamond
grains and a region of smaller diamond grains, said die having a

peripheral side surface and opposing top and bottom surfaces
wherein at least one portion of said peripheral side surface is in a

region of larger diamond grains and another opposing portion of
said peripheral side surface is in a region of smaller diamond grains,

an opening extends through said body from said top surface to said
bottom surface intermediate said one portion of said peripheral side

surface and said opposing portion of said side surface.
A die for drawing wire in accordance with claim 1 wherein said
one portion of a peripheral side surface corresponds to an initial

diamond growth surface.
A die for drawing wire in accordance with claim 1 wherein said
opening extends entirely through said body along an axial direction

from said top surface to said bottom surface orientation extending at
an angle to said axial direction.
A die for drawing wire in accordance with claim 3 wherein said
wire bearing portion comprises a straight bore section having a

circular cross section.
A die for drawing wire in accordance with claim 3 wherein said
opening tapers outwardly in one direction from said straight bore

section toward said top surface and tapers outwardly in the opposite
direction toward said bottom surfaces.
A die for drawing wire in accordance with claim 5 wherein said
outward taper in said one direction forms a exit taper for the wire

and said outward taper in the other direction toward said bottom
surface forms an entrance taper.
A die for drawing wire in accordance with claim 6 wherein said
entrance taper extends for a greater distance along the axial

direction than exit taper.
A die for drawing wire in accordance with claim 1 wherein said
body has a thickness as measured from one surface to the other

surface of about 0.3-10 millimeters. 
A die for drawing wire in accordance with claim 1 wherein said
diamond is grown by chemical vapor deposition on a substrate

consisting of Si, Ge, Mo, Nb, V, Ta, W, Ti, Zr or Hf or alloys thereof.
A die for drawing wire in accordance with claim 1 wherein said
diamond comprises a film of substantially transparent columns of

diamond crystals having a 〈110〉 orientation at an angle to the axial
direction of said opening.
