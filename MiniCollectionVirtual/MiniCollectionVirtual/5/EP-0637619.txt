<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved abrasive
composition and a process for polishing an object (a
material to be treated) with the use of said abrasive
composition. More particularly, the present invention
relates to an improved abrasive composition which enables
to attain a precisely polished surface for an object at an
improved processing efficiency and a process for polishing
an object with the use of said abrasive composition at an
improved processing efficiency wherein a precisely polished
surface is afforded for said object.There are known a number of abrasive processing
methods for polishing the surface of an object (a material
to be treated) using an abrasive composition comprising
abrasive grains dispersed in a dispersion medium.
Specifically, those abrasive finishing methods include
abrasive finishing method, lapping method, blast finishing
method (including sandblasting, shot peening, and liquid-honing 
methods), buffing method, and barrel finishing
method. These surface processing methods are selectively
employed depending upon the kind, hardness, or surface
roughness of an object to be treated or other processing
conditions involved.In recent years, there is an increased demand for
attaining a polished surface with a high precision not only
for optical lenses but also for other glass members such as
glass substrates used in optical discs, active matrix type
liquid crystal displays, and color filters for liquid
crystal televisions, glass substrates for liquid crystal
displays used in watches, electronic calculators, and
cameras, glass substrates used in solar cell modules, and
glass substrates used in LSI photomasks.Further, in recent years, in the surface-processing
of wafers including single crystal silicon wafers and
compound semiconductor substrates which are frequently used
as support members in integrated circuits, magnetic memory
hard discs, and laser members, the requirement for the
flatness of a processed-surface and the requirement for the
presence of defects (including scratch, orange peel, pits,
nodules, and crack) at a processed-surface have been
remarkably advanced.In addition to these factors, there is an increased
demand for reducing the production cost by attaining an 
improvement in the productivity while reducing the quantity
of defective products.Now, for instance, in the case of polishing the
surface of a glass member such as optical lens, glass
substrate, or the like, there can be mentioned an abrasive
composition as one of the processing conditions. The
