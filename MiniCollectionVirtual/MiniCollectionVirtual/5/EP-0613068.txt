<ABSTRACT>
A roller having a rigid core and a non-adherent 
coating layer which coating layer comprises a peroxide 

crosslinked fluororubber in which a low-molecular weight 
ethylene tetrafluoride resin and, optionally, a powder of a 

solid element and/or an inorganic compound having a surface 
energy higher than that of copper are compounded shows good 

levels of non-adherence to toner material and has excellent 
service durability; it therefore exhibits an excellent 

performance as a hot-pressing fixing roller of a high-speed, 
dry electrostatic duplicator.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a roll having a
rigid core and a non-adherent coating layer, and, in
particular, to a roll in which said non-adherent
coating layer comprises a peroxide crosslinked
fluororubber and which exhibits an excellent
performance as a hot-pressing fixing roll of a dry
electrostatic duplicator.Conventionally, hot-pressing fixing by means of a
heated roll having a metal core and a non-adherent
coating layer has been employed generally as a fixing
system of a dry electrostatic duplicator. As
materials for the non-adherent coating layer of the
hot-pressing roll are proposed a fluorine resin (US-A-3,268,351),
a dimethyl silicone rubber (US-A-3,666,247,
(JP-A-520 46,819), a phenyl silicone rubber
(JP-A-50 209 129), a
fluorosilicone rubber
(JP-A-30 26 947) and a fluororubber
(EP-A-0 018 140).
Some of them are employed for
practical use.However, these materials do not have sufficient
non-adherence to a toner for dry development. In
order to extend the endurance life of a fixing roll,
therefore, a so-called oil-feed method has to be
employed, by which a silicone oil is always supplied
on the surface of a roll.A roll coated with a fluorine resin generally
exhibits excellent non-adherence and not always needs
the supply of a silicone oil, but since it has a hard 
surface and lacks rubber elasticity, it has a defect of giving unnecessary gloss to the
copied surface. Regarding a roll coated with a dimethyl silicone rubber, dimethyl
silicone absorbs a silicone oil when heated and expands, and gives rise to
deterioration at an early stage and becomes incapable of being used. With respect to
phenyl silicone rubber coating, though silicone oil resistance is improved, non-adherence
to a toner tends to be decreased. Fluorosilicone rubber coating has
sufficient silicone oil resistance, but it is poor in non-adherence, heat resistance and
physical strength. In particular, its maximum service temperature is about 180 °C,
and, accordingly, it cannot be used as 230 °C, a surface temperature of a hot-pressing
fixing roll required for a high-speed duplicator of today. Fluororubber coating can
sustain a service temperature of 270 °C and is not invaded with a hot silicone oil at
all. However, it is poor in non-adherence to a toner and needs the supply of a large
amount of a silicone oil.EP-A-0310966 discloses use of perfluoropolyethers having perfluoroalkyl end
groups with a molecular weight ranging from 500 to 1500, in amounts from 0.5 to 3
parts by weight for 100 parts by weight of elastomer and
