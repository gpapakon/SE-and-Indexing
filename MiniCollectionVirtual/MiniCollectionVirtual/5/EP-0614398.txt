<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a catalyst composition and
method for the oxidation of oxidizeable components of a
gas-borne stream, e.g., for treatment of diesel engine exhaust,
and more specifically to the treatment of such diesel
exhaust to reduce the particulates content thereof.As is well-known, gas-borne streams from industrial
processes or engine exhausts often contain oxidizeable
pollutants such as unburned fuel and vaporized or condensed
oils. For example, diesel engine exhaust contains
not only gaseous pollutants such as carbon monoxide ("CO")
and unburned hydrocarbons ("HC"), but also soot particles
which, as described in more detail below, comprise both a
dry carbonaceous fraction and a hydrocarbon liquid which
is sometimes referred to as a volatile organic fraction
("VOF"), which terminology will be used herein, or a soluble
organic fraction. Accordingly, although sometimes
loosely referred to as an "exhaust gas", the exhaust of a
diesel engine is actually a heterogeneous material, comprising
gaseous, liquid and solid components. The VOF may
exist in diesel exhaust either as a vapor or as an aerosol
(fine droplets of liquid condensate) depending on the temperature
of the diesel exhaust.Oxidation catalysts comprising a platinum group metal
dispersed on a refractory metal oxide support are known
for use in treating the exhaust of diesel engines in order
to convert both HC and CO gaseous pollutants and particulates, 
i.e. soot particles, by catalyzing the oxidation of
these pollutants to carbon dioxide and water. One problem
faced in the treatment of diesel engine exhaust is presented
by the presence of sulfur in diesel fuel. Upon combustion,
sulfur forms sulfur dioxide and the oxidation catalyst
catalyzes the SO2 to SO3 ("sulfates") with subsequent
formation of condensible sulfur compounds, such as sulfuric
acid, which condense upon, and thereby add to, the mass of
particulates. The sulfates also react with activated
alumina supports to form aluminum sulfates, which render
activated alumina-containing catalysts inactive. In this
regard, see U.S. Patent 4,171,289 at column 1, line 39 et
seq. Previous attempts to deal with the sulfation problem
include the incorporation of large amounts of sulfate-resistant
materials such as vanadium oxide into the support
coating, or the use of alternative support materials such as
alpha-alumina (α-alumina), silica and titania, which are
sulfation-resistant materials.Generally, the prior art has attempted to deal with
these problems by dispersing a suitable
