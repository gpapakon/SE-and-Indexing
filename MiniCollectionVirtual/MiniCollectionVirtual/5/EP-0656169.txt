<ABSTRACT>
A high resolution photostimulable storage phosphor screen (12) for breast imaging using X-rays. The phosphor material for storing the image, SrS;Ce,Sm, is appropriately milled to a fine powder and dispersed, using appropriate methods, with high particle packing density, on a supporting substrate. The coated substrate forms a planar imaging screen for mammography. The phosphor screen (12) of the present invention can record high quality digital (as opposed to analog) images for diagnostic breast imaging.

Patent 4,812,660, entitled "Photoluminescent Materials
for Outputting Yellow-Green Light and U.S. application
Serial No. 07/034,333, filed March 3, 1987, now U.S.
Patent 4,822,520, entitled "Photoluminescent Materials
for Outputting Blue-Green Light".The present invention relates to an imaging
screen and readout system for mammography and, more 
particularly, to a mammography imaging system employing
an electron trapping phosphor.Diagnostic mammography is a powerful tool
for early detection of precancerous features in
breasts. Historically, breast screening using X-rays
was performed using radiographic film, without an
intensifying screen. Although the method provided very
high spatial resolution of breast features, a very high
radiation dose to the patient was required to expose
the film. Since the active layer on radiographic film
is relatively thin (e.g., 20 micrometers), a high
radiation exposure time was needed to allow the film to
absorb a sufficient number of X-ray photons to obtain a
high quality image. Presently, however, high
resolution intensifying fluorescent screens have been
developed which significantly reduce the radiation
exposure to the breast. With this approach,
radiographic film is placed on top of the intensifying
screen, which is farthest from the X-ray source. The
X-rays which pass through the patient are first
partially absorbed by the film, and the rest are more
strongly absorbed by the intensifying screen. The X-rays
absorbed by the intensifying screen cause the
screen to fluoresce and further expose the film. In
this way, the exposure to the patient is significantly
reduced. In fact, the radiation exposure needed for
the intensifying screen/film combination is very close
to the minimum exposure needed to obtain a high quality
image. That is, since there is inherently a
statistical variation in the number of X-ray quanta, a 
specific minimum number need to pass through the
patient and be absorbed by the imaging media to obtain
an image with minimal noise. Therefore, increased
sensitivity in the imaging media does not necessarily
