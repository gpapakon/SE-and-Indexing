<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to rechargeable electrochemical cells and, more particularly, to 
an advantageous combination of anode, cathode and electrolyte within such a cell. Rechargeable electrochemical cells, also known as secondary cells, typically include an 
anode, a cathode and an electrolyte. In many commercially available secondary cells 
the anode includes an alkali metal; the electrolyte is a solution containing an electrolytic 
salt which is usually an alkali metal as an anode; and the cathode includes an 
electrochemically active material, such as compound of a transition metal. During use, 
electrons pass from anode through exterior connecting circuitry to the cathode and 
alkali metal ions from the anode pass through the elctrolyte to the cathode where the 
ions are taken up, with the release of electrical energy. During charging, the flow of 
electrons and ions are reversed. In the design of secondary cells two issues are of importance. On the one hand the cell 
must be safe; on the other hand the cell must have good performance, meaning that it 
must be able to produce energy and be capable of being cycled (charged and 
discharged) numerous times. To meet the energy requirement of the secondary cells, the use of lithium as an anode 
material has been suggested. This is because it yields a cell having a very high energy 
density. That is, the cell that can store a substantial amount of electrical energy for a 
given size. Furthermore, manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and Li derivatives of manganese 
dioxide have been shown to be good cathode materials for such lithium-based cells as 
these materials provide a high electrochemical potential against lithium. Moreover, 
MnO₂ is inexpensive, environmentally friendly and readily available. As a result, 
considerable effort has been devoted to development of secondary Li/MnO₂ cells. Although some lithium-based cells have also met the requirement of being capable of 
being cycled numerous limes, they unfortunately have a number of problems in  
 
practical implementation. This is because these cells are not safe under abusive 
conditions such as overcharging, short circuiting or exposure to high temperature. The basic problem with this type of secondary cell is the high reactivity of the lithium 
deposits, which are formed on the anode during cycling, with the electrolyte. Abusive 
operating conditions can increase the temperature within the cell to the point where the 
lithium increases the temperature and, consequently the pressure, within the cell. This
