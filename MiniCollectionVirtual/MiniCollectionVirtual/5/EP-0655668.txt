<ABSTRACT>
Method of rapidly producing a contoured part, 
comprising: designing a computer graphic model of the part, 

sectioning the graphic model into graphic members which are 
at least one of blocks or slabs, carving a solid member (14-150mm 

in thickness) for each of the graphic members, the 
solid member being proportion to and enveloping such graphic 

members, the carving being carried out by accessing two or 
more sides (opposite sides) of such solid member to at least 

essentially duplicate the corresponding graphic member, and 
securing the carved solid members together to replicate the 

graphic model as a usable unitary part. The method can be 
modified to make castings by carving wax or foam solid 

members which are assembled to form an investment pattern, 
the was pattern being used in a shell mould casting steps 

and the foam pattern being used in evaporative casting 
steps.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to manufacturing and
shaping of parts constituted of reasonably rigid material,
and more particularly to rapid prototyping of such parts by
sectioned object machining which facilitates free-form
fabrication.It is becoming paramount that prototype parts and
their associated tools be fabricated faster in free-form, at
lower cost, particularly in metal shapes, have superior
surface finish and require little or no remachining.
Technology attempting to meet these objectives fall into
generally four categories: extruding, spraying, curing and
laminate forming. Each has significant disadvantages that
fail to meet all of the objectives.Extrusion uses a heated nozzle to extrude hot wax or
other polymer filaments, such as nylon, into a shape. It
cannot be used to make metal parts; it is fragile, subject
to delamination, and is expensive.Spraying can be either (i) an emulsion type where a
binder is sprayed onto a metal powder which is subsequently
laser sintered, or (ii) thermally sprayed at high
temperature using a metal powder to produce a shape.
Spraying is expensive, slow and produces a mediocre surface
finish which is porous.Curing, often times referred to as stereo
lithography, involves subjecting photo-sensitive polymer
resins in thin layers to a laser beam for curing and thence
repeating these steps to build up a part. It is generally
slow, useful only for nonmetals and tooling, and requires
expensive emission control measures because of the odorous
materials. It also demands post machining because the
surface is not stable during storage, is somewhat brittle,
and is size limited.Prior art laminate forming involves cutting of metal
plys, paper, plastic sheets or foam, by use of a laser beam, 
hot wire or mechanical cutter to make sheet-like cutouts;
the cutouts are subsequently assembled to form a unit,
Laminate forming first was carried out without a computer
graphic guide, the cutter following a mechanical guide.
More recently, the prior art has programmed the cutter to
follow a computer model or graphic such as shown in U.S.
Patent 4,675,825. The latter type of laminate forming has
been used to shape metal, hut fails to eliminate post-machining
of the unit, lacks high structural integrity
because of the need to use very thin laminates, is incapable
of making complex parts such as intricate engine cylinder
heads, manifolds or engine blocks, and is slow due to the
high number of handling and finishing operations resulting
from the number of laminatesThe requirement of

A method of making a contoured functional part,
comprising steps;


(a) designing a computer graphic model (10) of said
part;
(b) sectioning said graphic model (10) into a
plurality of graphic members;
(c) developing a computer program for a cutting
machine to cut a plurality of individual solid members

corresponding to the contours of said plurality of graphic
members;
(d) providing individual solid members, each having
a thickness that envelopes one of the corresponding

stratiforms; and
(e) securing an assembly of said solid members into
an integral unit to constitute said part;

(i) each graphic member, and in turn each solid
member, has a thickness that exceeds 14 millimetres;
(ii) the said computer program is developed for a
three-axis cutting machine; and
(iii) between steps (d) and (e) each solid member is
secured in a precise location and cut with said three-axis

cutting machine by use of a cutting axis to at least two
sides of said member to produce machined solid members

or brazing.
A method as claimed in claim 5, in which said
