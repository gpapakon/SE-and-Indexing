<ABSTRACT>
Known anchor rails for construction engineering with at least one projecting anchor consist of a U- or C-shaped rail section to which is interlockingly linked a massive anchor bolt by upsetting or another deformation process. Deforming the massive anchor bolt, in particular in the area of the back of the rail and of the free-standing anchor head, is complicated and expensive and requires costly deforming machines. The invention aims at substantially simplifying the construction and manufacture of such anchor rails without affecting  the carrying capacity of the anchor rail. For that purpose, at least the anchor shaft (4) is constituted by a tubular section; the tubular anchor foot (3) preferably extends through an opening (6) of the anchor rail (1) and interlockingly engages the latter by means of at least one shoulder (7) shaped at the end of the tubular section (2).

<CLAIMS>
An anchor rail for construction engineering including at 
least one anchor (2) projecting from the same, with its 

foot (3) being in firm contact with an anchor rail (1), 
including a fastening (5) at the free end of its shaft 

(4), wherein at least the full length of an anchor shaft 
(4) is designed of a tubular material. 
An anchor rail according to Claim 1, wherein the anchor 
foot (3), which is also tubular, passes through an 

aperture (6) in an anchor rail (1), overlapping the same 
in firm contact with at least one projection (7) moulded 

to its end. 
An anchor rail according to Claim 2, wherein an aperture 
(6) is surrounded by two projections of an anchor foot 

(3) provided approximately parallel to each other, 
preferably by collars (7,7'), buttons, claws or similar, 

with these projections being located on the inside (8) 

and outside (8') of an anchor rail (1) and surrounding 
an edge (9) of an aperture (6) on either side. 
An anchor rail according to Claims 2 or 3, wherein 
projections, such as collars (7, 7'), buttons, claws or 

similar are designed as plastic deformations of an 
anchor foot (3), preferably by upsetting and/or beading 

of the lower section of a tubular anchor shaft (4).  
 
An anchor rail according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
wherein an anchor shaft (4) is moulded flat at least 

over one partial section of its central area. 
An anchor rail according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
wherein an anchor shaft (4) is moulded flat over its 

full length between an anchor foot (3) and a fastener 
(5). 
An anchor rail according to Claims 5 or 6, wherein flat 
moulded tubular wall sections (10, 10') of an anchor 

shaft (4) are provided at a distance (a) from each 
other. 
An anchor rail according to Claims 5 or 6, wherein an 
anchor shaft (4) includes two flat tubular wall sections 

(10, 10') provided closely adjacent to each other. 
An anchor rail according to one of Claims 5 to 8, 
wherein compressed tubular wall sections (10a, 10'a) 

include a minimum of one rib-shaped longitudinal 
section, preferably two rib-shaped longitudinal sections 

(11, 11') provided symmetrically to each other. 
An anchor rail according to Claim 9, wherein rib-shaped, 
preferably rounded longitudinal sections (11, 11' and/or 

11a, 11'a) are located next to flat sectional contours 
(10a, 10'a and/or 12, 12'). 
An anchor rail according to Claim 9, wherein 
approximately flat longitudinal sections (12, 12') of a 

compressed anchor shaft (4) are provided between two 
rib-type marginal areas (11a, 11'a), having an 

approximately round contour.  
 
An anchor rail according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
wherein the section of a shaft (4) is round or oval or 

approximately square or polygonal. 
An anchor rail according to one of Claims 5 to 12, 
wherein an at least approximately flat compressed shaft 

(4) is tapered and reduced from an anchor foot (3) 
towards a fastener (5). 
An anchor rail according to one of Claims 5 to 7 and 9 
to 12, wherein an at least approximately flat compressed 

shaft (4) is at least approximately lozenge-shaped 
between an anchor foot (3) and a fastener (5) in 

longitudinal section. 
An anchor rail according to one of Claims 1 to 14, 
wherein a fastener (5) is widened in relation to the 

section of an anchor shaft (4). 
An anchor rail according to Claim 15, wherein a fastener 
(5) is moulded from the tubular end of an anchor shaft 

(4), preferably allowing the said anchor shaft (4) to 
include a widened double collar (5'). 
An anchor shaft according to one of Claims 1 to 16, 
wherein a fastener (5), a shaft (4) and an anchor foot 

(3) are integral part of a tubular moulding having a 
round, oval or polygonal section. 
An anchor rail according to one of claims 3 to 17, 
wherein a collar (7') provided on the outside (8') of an 

anchor rail (1) is provide as an oval shape, with its 
longer axis being positioned in a longitudinal direction 

of an anchor rail. 
An anchor rail according to one of Claims 2 to 18, 
wherein at least one of the projections, a collar (7), a  

 
button, a claw or similar overlapping at least an 

aperture (6) within an anchor rail (1) is larger than 
the width (3) of a longitudinal slot (L) of an anchor 

rail (1). 
An anchor rail according to one of Claims 2 to 19, 
wherein a marginal area (9') of an aperture (6) to 

accommodate an internal projection (7) has been moulded 
towards the outside, allowing the said projection to be 

at least approximately flush with the inside (8) of the 
back of an anchor rail (1'). 
An anchor rail according to one of Claims 1 to 20, 
wherein the connection between a shaft (4) and the rear 

wall of an anchor rail (1), which is at least in close 
contact on either side, includes reinforcing 

projections.
