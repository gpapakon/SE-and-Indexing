<ABSTRACT>
The new hopper (1) for the temporary storage and controlled delivery of solid items in slabs or lumps, such as filter cakes occurring in chamber filter presses, for example, has at least one lower slot-shaped discharge opening (4, 4'), down to which the hopper bottom (7, 7', 8, 8') tapers. Serving as discharge device are conveying strips (35, 36) which are provided with a pendulum drive (23, 28, 24), oscillate about a horizontal shaft (11, 12) and scrape over the hopper bottom (7, 7', 8, 8') which is curved in the manner of a cylinder casing in the region of the discharge opening (4, 4'). There are preferably two discharge openings (4, 4') with corresponding pendulum conveying strips (7, 7', 8, 8'). The conveying strips have a wedge profile (35, 36), the tip of the wedge having a loosening effect and the rear surface having a conveying effect.
