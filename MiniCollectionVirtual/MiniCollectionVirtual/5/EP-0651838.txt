<ABSTRACT>
A submersible electrically-operated water closet valve comprises a body (13) having a water outlet (20) extending therefrom securable in an outlet to a water closet cistern (10). A chamber (14) within the body has at least one inlet opening thereinto and a valve member (16) slidable within the chamber to close the outlet (20). The body (13) also contains a sealed solenoid (19) electrically connectable to a remote controller device, the valve member (16) being magnetically attractable by the solenoid (19), whereby the remote controller device may be operated to energise the solenoid (19) to move the valve member (16), thereby opening the outlet (20) and allowing water in the cistern (10) to flow through the inlet to the outlet (20).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electrically-operated water closet valve to replace 
the traditional syphon system. Currently used water closet syphon valves require a means to ensure that, after 
the initial operation by the user (usually a lever or a chain operated lever), the water 
continues to flow until flushing is completed, even though the user has released the 
lever. Other requirements are that the flushing system should never fail in such a way 
that the outlet valve remains open, which would cause continuous flow from the cistern 
inlet to the outlet. A disadvantage of the existing syphon systems is that it is difficult to dispense a 
fraction of the entire contents of the tank, and therefore a separate tank is required for 
each flushing outlet in a multiple water closet installation, for example in public 
conveniences. AU-A-21489/88 discloses a solenoid-operated flush valve for a water closet 
cistern, having a mechanical linkage from a solenoid mounted externally of the cistern 
to lift a valve member within the cistern. This arrangement renders fitting to an existing 
cistern in place of a syphon valve difficult or impossible, in view of the accuracy required 
in mounting all the components of the linkage, and the solenoid, in their correct 
relative positions. JP-A-57 037 168 discloses a submerged valve having a pair of electromagnets, 
one of which is fixed and the other of which overlies the first and is magnetically repelled 
from the first upwardly to lift a valve member when the electromagnets are energised. 
A float on the upper magnet assists in holding the valve open.  
 EP-A-0 453 702 discloses a solenoid-operated water closet valve, in which the 
solenoid is mounted above the water at the top of the water closet cistern, and operates 
to lift a valve member against a return spring. The present invention provides a submersible electrically-operated water closet 
valve, comprising electromagnet means submersible in a water closet cistern and energisable 
by an external electrical power source to lift a valve member from a valve seat 
to open an outlet through which water can flow, characterised in that the valve comprises 
a body having a water outlet extending therefrom securable in an outlet to the 
water closet cistern, a chamber within the body having at least one inlet opening thereinto, 
a valve member slidable within the chamber to close said outlet, the body also 
containing a sealed solenoid electrically connectable to a remote controller device, the 
valve member being

<CLAIMS>
A submersible electrically-operated water closet valve (11), comprising electromagnet 
means submersible in a water closet cistern (10) and energisable by an external 

electrical power source to lift a valve member (16) from a valve seat to open an outlet (20) 
through which water can flow, characterised in that the valve comprises a body (13) 

having a water outlet (20) extending therefrom securable in an outlet to the water 
closet cistern, a chamber (14) within the body having at least one inlet opening thereinto, 

a valve member (16) slidable within the chamber to close said outlet, the body 
also containing a sealed solenoid (19) electrically connectable to a remote controller 

device (40-43), the valve member (16) being magnetically attractable by the solenoid 
(19), whereby the remote controller device may be operated to energise the solenoid to 

move the valve member, thereby opening the outlet and allowing water in the cistern to 
flow through the inlet to the outlet. 
A valve according to Claim 1, wherein the valve member (16) is slidable 
vertically to open or close the outlet. 
A valve according to Claim 1 or 2, comprising a spring (30) to bias the 
valve member towards the closed position. 
A valve according to Claim 1, 2 or 3, in combination with a remote controller 
device (40-43) arranged to send to the solenoid a higher voltage to open the 

valve and then a lower voltage to hold the valve open for a predetermined period. 
A valve according to Claim 4, wherein the remote controller device 
(40-43) comprises variable timing means to permit said predetermined period to be 

varied according to the desired volume of water required. 
A valve according to any preceding claim, comprising an overflow tube 
(32) within the cistern opening at its lower end in the water outlet and extending  

 
upwardly to open at a predetermined overflow level. 
A water closet cistern, comprising a valve according to any preceding 
claim, the outlet being connected to a water closet bowl or to a urinal.
