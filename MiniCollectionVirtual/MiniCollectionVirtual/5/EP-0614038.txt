<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to lubrication systems for
lubricating the bearings of bearing equipment items. More
specifically, the present invention pertains to lubrication systems
in which an oil mist is formed by combining air and oil and then
distributed to the bearings to be lubricated.For many years bearings have been lubricated by various
means. In early lubrication systems, bearings were lubricated by
"one shot" application of grease and/or oil to a grease or oil
fitting with a grease gun or oil can. Although attempts were made
to apply the grease or oil at needed periodic frequencies, it is
obvious that at times too much oil and/or grease was used, and at
other times, not enough oil and/or grease was provided for
lubrication. For this reason, lubrication systems which apply the
lubricant and at timed, periodic intervals or on a continuous
basis, were developed.U. S. Patent No. 4,445,168 discloses a microcomputer
controlled lubrication system which monitors and controls
lubrication. In this system, individual "shots" of lubricant are
periodically delivered based on either a time cycle or a machine
stroke cycle. Other systems, such as the one disclosed in U.S.
Patent No. 4,527,661 and GB-A-678105 utilize what is referred to in the industry as
an "air - oil lubrication system" in which separate oil and air
streams are brought to and combined by a mixing device, i.e. a spray nozzle or
atomizer, at a point immediately adjacent to the bearing being
lubricated. An individual mixing device is required for each point of lubrication. The particles of oil in such systems, referred to as "air-oil" lubrication systems are relatively large and cannot be transferred in an air stream over long distances. Therefore such systems require two sets of piping (one
for oil and one for air) and individual mixing devices at each
point of lubrication.In more recent years, oil mist lubrication systems have been
developed to provide continuous, effective lubrication to antifriction
bearings of rotating equipment such as centrifugal pumps,
electric motors, steam turbines, gear boxes, blowers, and fans. 
An oil mist lubrication system typically comprises an oil mist
generator in which a compressed air stream in turbulent flow is
combined with a liquid lubricant to create a fine mist of oil
particles suspended in an air stream. These oil particles are
typically one to five micrometres in diameter. The oil mist is
transported through a piping system and delivered into the bearing
housings of rotating equipment. The oil mist

<CLAIMS>
A lubricating system for continuous
lubrication of a plurality of bearings of one or more

bearing-equipped items (M1, M2, M3, M4), the system
comprising: oil mist generation means (B) by which air

and oil are combined to form a dry oil mist; a
distribution assembly (C) connected to the oil mist

generation means (B) and by which dry oil mist
therefrom is remotely transmitted to one or more

reclassifiers (14), and then to the bearings, the
reclassifiers (14) converting the dry oil mist to wet

oil mist prior to transmittal to the bearings; and
collection means (D) connected to the bearing-equipped

items for collecting oil and excess oil mist from the
bearings;


the system being characterized by a return
assembly (E) connected to the collection means and by

which excess oil mist is returned for reuse; the oil
and oil mist in the distribution assembly (C), the

collection means (D) and the return assembly (E) being
completely enclosed and isolated from the surrounding

environment;
the system also being characterized by an oil
collection/supply vessel (A) connected to the return

assembly (E) and into which the excess oil mist,
uncontaminated by the surrounding environment, is

returned for reuse; and
the system being further characterized by
demisting filter means (110, 111, 112, 113) connected

to the oil collection/supply vessel (A) and by which
excess oil mist from the return assembly (E) is

separated into oil and oil-free air, the oil for
accumulating in the oil collection/supply vessel and

the oil-free air for venting therefrom.
A lubricating system as claimed in claim 1,
in which the oil collection/supply vessel (A) is 

connected to the oil mist generator means (B) to supply
oil for the combination of the air and oil therein to

form the oil mist.
A lubricating system as claimed in claim 1 or
2, in which the demisting filter means includes a motor

driven drum (111) which, by centrifugal force, forces
oil mist through filter media (114) to coalesce and

separate oil from the excess oil mist for gravity flow
into a supply tank (100), the oil-free air being vented

through vent means (115, 116) to the atmosphere.
A lubrication system as claimed in any
preceding claim, in which the distribution assembly (C)

includes a supply header (11) connected to the oil mist
generation means (B) for distributing oil mist

therefrom to the one or more reclassifiers (14) for
receiving oil mist from the supply header (11) and

converting fine particles of oil in the dry oil mist to
larger particles of oil in the wet oil mist for

distribution to one or more of the bearings, the
bearings being enclosed under positive pressure and

isolated from the atmosphere.
A lubricating system as claimed in
claim 4, including at least one oil mist

manifold (13) having an inlet connected to the supply
header (11) and one or more outlets, one of which is

connected to the one reclassifier (14).
A lubricating system as claimed in claim 5,
in which the oil mist manifold (13) is provided with a

normally closed valve (31), the outlet (40) of which is
connected to the collection means (D), opening of the

valve (31) allowing any oil accumulated in the manifold
(13) to drain to the collection means (D).
A lubricating system as claimed in claim 6,

in which the oil mist manifold (13) is provided with a
transparent sight tube (32) through which any oil

accumulating in the manifold (13) may be viewed and, 
when the oil is drained from the sight tube (32), oil

mist flow may be viewed.
A lubricating system as claimed in any
preceding claim, in which the collection means (D)

comprises an enclosed container (50) to which drain
lines (55) from one or more of the bearings are

connected and into which excess oil and oil mist from
the bearings may flow and accumulate.
A lubricating system as claimed in claim 8,
in which the enclosed container (50) is provided with a

drain outlet (56) through which coalesced oil may be
drained for reuse or disposal.
A lubricating system as claimed in claim 8 or
9, in which the collection means (D) comprises a pump

(60), the inlet (63, 64) of which communicates with oil
in the enclosed container (50) and the outlet (72) of

which is connected to the return assembly (E),
operation of the pump (60) transferring oil from the

enclosed container (50) through the return assembly (E)
for reuse thereof.
A lubricating system as claimed in any
preceding claim, in which the return assembly (E)
