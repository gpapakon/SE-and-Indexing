<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to metallurgical processes and more 
particularly to a method of treating dross materials extracted from 
melting chambers of metallurgical processes, particularly from those 
melting chambers utilized to melt and remelt aluminum ore and/or aluminum 
scrap materials to improve homogeneity with alloying elements being added 
to further improve physical properties. It long has been known in the metallurgical arts to mix salt with 
an aluminum metal or dross material and to melt or remelt the same to 
provide fused aluminum and fused salt which is continuously circulated in 
the melting process, attention being directed to U.S. patents: No. 
2,987,391, issued June 6, 1961 to T.W.F. Foster et al; to No. 3,070,437, 
issued December 25, 1962 to Robert W. Bacheldor; to No. 3,417,166, issued 
on December 17, 1968 to T.W.F. Foster; and to No. 3751243, issued August 
7, 1973, to M.E. Mcleod. In Foster patent No. 3,417,166 it also is 
disclosed to provide a salt composition of sodium chloride and potassium 
chloride in selected proportions by weight to form an eutectic mixture in 
the melting of aluminum with the density of the mixture being less than 
the metal to be melted so that the metal may be collected below the 
molten salt to be protected from the atmosphere. It also is known to transport dross materials removed from a 
melting furnace such as in aluminum melting processes to a heated rotary 
kiln where the dross materials are again mixed with appropriate salts and 
a certain amount of aluminum in the dross materials is recaptured from 
the heated rotary kilns. Further, it generally is known in the metallurgical arts to 
suppress and utilize waste materials in the form of metallurgical dusts 
created by metallurgical furnaces by wetting down such dusts entrained in 
gaseous by-products with liquids and subsequently treating the wetted 
dust products for recycling recovery. In this regard, attention is 
directed to U.S. patent No. 3,320,052, issued to J.J. Bowden on May 16, 
1967, wherein dust particles entrained in gas formed in an aluminum 
melting process are wetted down with water and the resulting sludge 
treated with lime, limestone, iron oxide, mill scale and dolomite to 
absorb the water, producing a flux utilizable in the steel making 
process. Attention also is directed to U.S. patent No. 3,996,340, issued 
to F. Steineke on December 7, 1976, wherein silica dust recovered from  
 
metallurgical furnace smoke is admixed with fluorspar and treated with 
steam and

Method of treating dross materials at the site of a melting 
chamber (3) in a metallurgical process, comprising:
 
   removing said dross materials from a removal mouth (4) of said 

melting chamber (3) at said melting site in at least one stage during and 
promptly after completion of the melting process to a preselected area 

immediately adjacent the removal mouth (4) of said melting chamber site; 
promptly applying a preselected interacting fines suppressing agent at 

said immediately adjacent preselected area from a fines suppressing 
vibrating distributing source positioned above said removal mouth (4) to 

the surface of said dross materials so removed, said dust suppressing 
agent being applied in preselected sufficient quantities to substantially 

cover the entirety of the exposed surface of the stage of dross materials 

so removed from said melting chamber (3) to inhibit further oxidation of 
said dross materials to suppress oxide dust fines and enhance heat 

conduction; and removing said suppressed dross materials for further 
processing, allowing sufficient residence time for said suppressing agent 

to enter into interacting relation with treated and confined dross 
materials to produce caking before further processing.  

 
Method according to claim 1, wherein said preselected area 
immediately adjacent said melting chamber site is a partially enclosed 

chamber (3) of preselected size and configuration. 
Method according to claim 1 or 2, wherein said dross removal 
from said melting chamber (3) is accomplished in a plurality of layered 

stages with the suppressing agent being applied in sufficient quantities 
to cover the surface of each layered stage. 
Method according to claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein said preselected 
fines suppressing agent is chemically selected to instantaneously cover 

and absorb said oxide dust fines enhancing heat transfer within said 
covered dross materials. 
Method according to any of the preceding claims, wherein said 
dross materials are the product of an aluminum smelting process. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, wherein said 
dross materials are the product of an aluminum smelting process and said 

preselected fines suppressing agent is a granular salt to cake said dross 
materials. 
Method according to claim 6, wherein said granular salt applied  
 

to said at least one removed stage of dross materials comprises 
approximately eight (8) to fifteen (15) percent by weight of the total 

weight of the treated materials. 
Method according to claim 6 or 7, wherein said granular salt is 
a preselected mixture by weight of the total weight of the mixture of 

sodium chloride (NaCl) and potassium chloride (KCl). 
Method according to claim 8, wherein said granular salt 
comprises by weight of approximately fifteen to sixty-five (15-65) 

percent sodium chloride (NaCl) and eighty-five to thirty-five (85-35) 
percent potassium chloride (KCl) of the total weight of the mixture of 

such materials. 
Method of treating aluminum containing dross materials at the 
site of an aluminum melting chamber (3) in a metallurgical aluminum 

melting process, comprising:
 
   raking the dross materials in successive stages from the surface of 

the melting aluminum in the melting chamber into a partially enclosed 
open ended tub (14) resting immediately adjacent the outlet of said 

aluminum melting chamber (3) with the dross materials of each stage being 
at an approximate temperature of 1450°F (788°C) when so raked into said tub (14); 

instantaneously applying to the surface of each stage of dross materials 
raked into said tub (14) from a fines suppressing vibrating distributing 

source (16, 17) positioned proximate and immediately above said open 
ended tub (14) a granular interacting salt mixture mixed and 

pneumatically fed to said vibrating distributing source (16, 17) and 
amounting to approximately eight (8) to fifteen (15) percent by weight of 

the total weight of the raked stages and being sufficient to 
substantially cover the entirety of the surface of such stage, said 

granular salt comprising approximately by weight of fifteen to sixty-five 
percent sodium chloride and eighty-five to thirty-five percent potassium 

chloride of the total weight of the mixture; and allowing sufficient 
residence time for the salt mixture to interact with said confined fines 

to produce aluminum oxide cakes in the dross materials before removing 
said tub (14) from the melting site for further aluminum recovery 

processing from the caked dross materials.
