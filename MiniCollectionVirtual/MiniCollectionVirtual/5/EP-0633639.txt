<ABSTRACT>
The device comprises: a support member (5); a casing (6); and 
a closing and covering member (7, 7a). The support member (5) 

may be attached to an external member and may receive an 
electrical mechanism; it is provided with means for coupling 

to the casing (6) and this coupling allows access of conductors 
from said raceway means (1). The casing (6) is prismatic 

in shape and is adapted to surround the support member (5) 
and the electrical mechanism; it is provided with a bight 

(13) in one side wall thereof. The closing and covering 
member (7, 7a) has a wall portion (17) and a hood portion 

(19, 20); the wall portion (17) may be attached to the edges 
(16) of the bight (13) to close it and the hood portion (19, 

20) covers a portion of the raceway means (1). Where necessary, 
a guide member (8) is attached to a portion of the 

raceway means (1) and is covered by the hood portion (20).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for adapting an electrical 
mechanism to a raceway means for electrical conductors, 
particularly to a raceway means formed by: a base section 
having a bottom wall and side walls having respective 
longitudinal grooves, and by a lid section having two 
inwardly directed lips for engagement in said longitudinal 
grooves, comprising a support member; a casing; and a closing 
and covering member, so that: said support member: (i) is 
adapted to be attached to a support surface; (ii) is provided 
with a base for receiving an electrical mechanism; (iii) 
comprises side surfaces; (iv) and is provided with first 
means for coupling said support member to said casing; said 
casing: (i) is of generally prismatic shape defining side 
surfaces; (ii) is adapted to be disposed around said support 
member and said electrical mechanism ; (iii) is provided with 
second means for coupling said support member with said 
casing, which are adapted to engage with said first means; 
and (iv) has, on one of said side surfaces, a bight defining 
first edges and which is adapted to be opposite said recessed 
surface; and said closing and covering member has: (i) a wall 
portion defining second edges and which is adapted to be 
attached to said first edges, closing said bight; and (ii) a 
hood portion adapted to cover a portion of said raceway 
means. An example of such a prior art device can be found in EP-A-239456. The invention is particularly applicable to small sized 
raceway means. In these cases, the said electrical mechanisms, 
such as for example, a socket, a switch, a change-over 
switch, a safety or protection appliance, etc, have to be 
installed alongside the said raceway means, since the size 
of the latter does not allow them to be housed therein. 
Depending on needs, they are arranged either at any point 
along the raceway means, or at a terminal end of the raceway 
means, which may be front or lateral, with it being possible 
to use one or the other simultaneously.  
 In one known embodiment, these electrical mechanisms are 
installed with their surface box, a hole being made in the 
latter for the passage of the conductors from the raceway 
means, mating with another hole formed in the near wall of 
the raceway means base section. In other cases, devices have been developed to rationalize 
and facilitate the connection of the raceway means conductors 
to an electrical mechanism in a way which allowed the 
regulation governing electrical installations to be fulfilled. Among
