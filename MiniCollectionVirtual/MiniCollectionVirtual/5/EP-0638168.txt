of a variety of biomolecules, including DNA species,
proteins, peptides, and derivatized amino acids. One
electrophoretic technique which allows rapid, high-resolution
separation is capillary electrophoresis
(CE) (Cohen, 1987, 1988; Compton; Kaspar).
Typically, the CE employs fused silica capillary
