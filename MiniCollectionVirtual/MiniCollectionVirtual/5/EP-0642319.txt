<ABSTRACT>
A cleaning machine, especially for professional cleaning, comprises two parallel and cylindrical brushes (2) driven reversedly about a horizontal axis, the brushes being placed so closely together that the ends of the brushes in the plane defined by the rotational axes of the brushes almost join, touch one another or just overlap. Above said plane one or more sweepers (8) in the form of bars, pipes, stretched wires or the like are arranged in the longitudinal direction of the brushes and which are extending into the course of rotation of the brush ends. There is a shield (4) above the brushes for collecting the dirt that is thrown off these when meeting the sweepers. At the exterior of the brushes the shield ends in collecting conduits (6) from which the collected dirt may pass to a collecting tank. This design proves capable of performing a simultaneous sweeping and washing of a floor. At the same time the construction is sufficiently compact to accomodate a per se known polishing unit such that a simultaneous polishing of the floor is possible.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Floor cleaning machineThe present invention relates to a cleaning machine, especially for professional cleaning and having two parallel and cylindrical brushes driven reversedly about a horizontal axis.In commercial cleaning of large floor spaces as e.g. in super markets, sales rooms, schools, sports centres, nursing homes, hospitals and industrial pre¬ mises having a solid flooring such as linoleum, marble tiles, wood, an initial mopping is carried out to remove loose dirt from the floor. This is typically carried out manually by using mops. Then a mechanical washing of the floor is carried out and if required a polishing of the floor can finish the job. This is also performed mechan¬ ically, but the polishing cannot begin until the floor has dried after washing. Such a cleaning demands three individual workings of the floor at the same time wait¬ ing for the floor to dry before the polishing can be initiated.The type of floor washers found most frequently is based on rotating brush roundels, typically two or three. The cleaning agent is dosed in the centre of the roundels. In some cases at the front. After the roundels comes a suction foot consisting of two closely set rub¬ ber lips from which surplus water left after the roundels is sucked up into a collecting tank. The floor is left sufficiently dry for it to be walked on, but not sufficiently dry to be polished immediately. Certain large automotive models of floor washers have a rotating cylindrical horizontal brush intended to sweep the floor in front of the roundels. The brush, however, sweeps the dirt forwardly into a funnel situated in front and raised above floor level, which is not particularly effective. This type of floor washer is also unable to function when close to walls or racks. 

 Another type of floor washers that has come on the market comprises a rotating, cylindrical, horizontal brush at either side of a collecting tank. A vertical rubber belt is placed between the brushes and the tank. The brushes sweep the dirty detergent towards the rubber belts, it is led upwardly and is scraped off at the upper edge of the collecting tank and falls down into this. The washer has the advantage over the other type that it can come closer to walls and racks and that dirt that has not been collected at one brush can be col¬ lected by "the reversed rotation of the other one. Despite its virtues this floor washer, too, is only capable of performing a washing of the floor.The present invention introduces a completely dif¬ ferent and new principle

<CLAIMS>
 C L A I M S :
1. A cleaning machine, especially for professional cleaning and comprising at least two parallel and cyl¬ indrical brushes (2) driven reversedly about a hori¬ zontal axis, the brushes being placed so closely to¬ gether that the ends of the brushes in the plane defined by the rotational axes of the brushes almost join, touch one another or just overlap is characterized in that above this plane one or more sweepers (8) in the form of bars, pipes, stretched wires or the like are arranged in the longitudinal direction of the brushes and which are extending into the course of rotation of the brush ends and that above the brushes there is a shield (4) for collecting the dirt that is thrown off these when meet¬ ing the sweepers, and at the exterior of the brushes the shield ends in collecting conduits (6) from which the collected dirt may pass to a collecting tank.
2. A cleaning machine according to claim 1, charac¬ terized in that for each brush two sweepers are ar¬ ranged, one placed before and one after the summit of the brush.
3. A cleaning machine according to claims 1 or 2, characterized in that the cross sectional dimension of the sweepers is several times smaller than the diameter of the brushes.
4. A cleaning machine according to claims 1, 2 or 3, characterized in that the mounting of the sweepers comprises an adjustment device (30-38) such that the sweepers may extend more or less into the course of the brushes.
5. A cleaning machine according to claims 1-4, 


characterized in that it comprises several sets of brushes arranged next to and/or after one another.
6. A cleaning machine according to claims 1-5, characterized in that it comprises a per se known pol¬ ishing unit (28) placed after the brushes (22) .
7. A cleaning machine according to claim 6, charac¬ terized in that in that a suction foot (24) is placed between the brushes (22) and the polishing unit (28) .
8. A cleaning machine according to claim 6, charac¬ terized in that the suction foot comprises a longitudi¬ nally displaceable part (44) extending from the side of the machine and which can engage the side contours of a room.
3. A cleaning machine according to claims 7 or 8, characterized in that an air nozzle arrangement is ar¬ ranged after the suction foot (24) , preferably in the form of a rail (26) emitting air down towards the floor for drying this preferably using the exhaust air from the suction devices.
10. A cleaning machine according to one of the claims 1-9, characterized in that the outlet (10) of the conduits of the brush section each is connected to its own suction device and the same applies to a possible suction foot, and attached to separate collection tanks (56, 58, 60).
11. A cleaning machine according to one of the claims 1 - 10, characterized in that in the conduits there is a brush (40) prefer¬ ably driven and with the brush elements arranged in helicals for transportation of the collected dirt to the outlet (10).
