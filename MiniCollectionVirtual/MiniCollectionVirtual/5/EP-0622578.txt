<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to quick-acting coupling, comprising two coupling halves (I, II) which can be brought together in a sealing fit and exhibit a valve body (VI) which is spring-loaded against a valve-seat surface (15) of the coupling housing (3) and can be shifted into the valve-opening position from an abutment flank (a), of the coupling half (I), arranged in a stationary manner on said coupling half (I), the abutment flank (a) being arranged in one coupling half (I) such that it is set back. In order to achieve a construction which is more reliable to use and is more favourable for flow, the invention proposes that the set-back abutment flank (a) be formed by a central protrusion (D) which has medium flowing around it and moves into the other coupling half (II).

Snap-lock coupling, consisting of two coupling halves (I, 
II) which can be fitted together sealingly and which each 

comprise a valve body (V1, V2) spring-biased against a seat 
surface (15, 19) of the coupling housing (3, 16), which can 

be displaced into the valve open position by an impact flank 
(a, b) arranged stationarily on the other coupling half (I, 

II), wherein one impact flank (a) is set back in one 
coupling half (I), characterised in that the setb
ack impact 
flank (a) is formed by a central mandrel (D) around which 

medium flows and which enters the other coupling half (II), 
wherein both valve bodies (V1, V2) are set back in the 

coupling halves (I, II). 
Snap-lock coupling according to claim 1, characterised in 
that medium throughflow openings (41) of the mandrel (D) 

form through-passages for control of the spring-biased valve 
body (V1) of the coupling half (I) fitted with the mandrel 

(D) by means of the impact flank (b) formed by the free end 
of a nipple (1). 
Snap-lock coupling according to claim 2, characterised in 
that the mandrel (D) around which medium flows is seated on 

a bush (23) through which medium flows and which at its end 
opposite the mandrel (D) forms the seat surface (15) of the 

valve body (V1) of one coupling half (I). 
Snap-lock coupling according to claim 3, characterised in 
that the bush (23) carries a sliding member (SG) which, 

displaced by the impact flank (b) of the nipple (1), moves 
the valve body (V1) into the open position. 
Snap-lock coupling according to claim 4, characterised in 
that the sliding member (SG) is formed by a sleeve (32) 

encompassing the bush (23).  
 
Snap-lock coupling according to claim 5, characterised in 
that the bush (23) carries slots (33) in the peripheral 

wall, in which are guided impact fingers (34) of the sleeve 
(32). 
Snap-lock coupling according to claim 6, characterised in 
that the sleeve (32) is spring-biased in the direction of 

its normal position. 
Snap-lock coupling according to claims 5 and 6, 
characterised in that the sleeve (32) supports locking balls 

(7) of a locking device (4) and has the same outside 
diameter as the nipple (1). 
Snap-lock coupling according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the valve bodies (V1, V2) are fitted with a guide ring 

(37) which is arranged in front of the valve seat surface 
(15 or 19) and through which medium flows. 
Snap-lock coupling according to claims 6 and 9, 
characterised in that the impact fingers (34) move against 

the end edge of one guide ring (37). 
Snap-lock coupling according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the mandrel (D) is star-shaped in cross-section and 

tapers towards the free end. 
Snap-lock coupling according to claim 6, characterised 
in that the bush (23) forms the support bearing of a 

compression spring (31) which biases the sleeve (32) into 
the normal position. 
Snap-lock coupling according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the mandrel (D) is formed by the front region (43) 

of a multiple-leg insert piece of the coupling half (I) and 
the ends of the legs (44) are seated in recesses in the 

inner wall of a central cavity (2) of the coupling housing  
 

(3). 
Snap-lock coupling according to claim 13, characterised 
in that the recesses are formed by an annular groove (45). 
Snap-lock coupling according to claim 13, characterised 
in that the free ends of the legs (44) are bent into the 

recess. 
Snap-lock coupling according to claim 13, characterised 
in that the free ends of the legs (44) are spring-deflected 

into the recess. 
Snap-lock coupling according to claim 13, characterised 
in that the legs (44) have wing profiles located in the 

direction of flow. 
Snap-lock coupling according to claim 15, characterised 
in that the legs (44), starting from a projectile-shaped 

core piece, are bent to a quarter circle shape. 
Snap-lock coupling according to claims 13 to 18, 
characterised in that the free ends of the legs (44) are 

hammer head-shaped. 
Snap-lock coupling according to claims 13 to 19, 
characterised in that the multiple-leg insert piece (mandrel 

D) is constructed as a bent sheet metal part. 
Snap-lock coupling according to claim 20, characterised 
in that the basic blank is a stamped double-T part of which 

the T-bars form the legs (44) and the web folded to a U-shape 
forms the projectile-shaped core piece of the mandrel 

(D). 
Snap-lock coupling according to claim 21, characterised 
in that the free ends of the legs (44) of the bent sheet  

 
metal part (mandrel D) are formed from sections (50) bent in 

the circumferential direction of the inner wall of the 
cavity (2) of the coupling housing (3).
