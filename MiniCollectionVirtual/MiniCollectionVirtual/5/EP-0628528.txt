<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to difluoro-derivative 
compounds, compounds having a liquid crystal property 
selected from such derivatives, liquid crystal 
compositions containing the difluoro-derivative 
compounds, and liquid crystal electro-optical devices 
using the liquid crystal compositions. Liquid crystal display devices have been used for 
watches and electronic calculators and in recent years 
for various applications including measuring devices, 
automobile meters, copying machines, cameras, display 
devices for office appliances and display devices for 
consumer products. Accordingly, various functions 
including a wide temperature range for operation, a low 
voltage for driving, a high response speed, a high 
contrast ratio, a wide visual angle and chemical 
stability, are required for such liquid display devices. However, at present, there is no single material 
which by itself satisfies all of such requirements, and 
it is common to satisfy such requirements by a liquid 
crystal composition prepared by mixing a plurality of  
 
liquid crystal materials and non-liquid crystal 
materials. Accordingly, it is desired to develop a 
liquid crystal material or a non-liquid crystal material 
which is excellent in one or more functions, if not in 
all the required functions. In the field of the display device using liquid 
crystal, it is desired to improve its performance. For 
this purpose, low voltage driving, highly fine display, a 
high contrast ratio, a wide visual angle characteristic, 
a low temperature response characteristic and a wide 
range of driving temperature are, for example, desired. 
These functions have a tendency such that when some of 
them are improved, others have to be sacrificed. Recently, improvement of a response speed is 
particularly desired. For example, in driving the device 
by an electrical cell, low voltage drive and high speed 
response are desired; in e.g. the office appliances, 
highly fine display and high speed response are required; 
and in the display for automobiles, low temperature 
response or high speed response within a wide temperature 
range for operation is desired. In this respect, several methods for improvement are 
conceivable. One of them is to adopt a liquid crystal 
composition having a low viscosity. Namely, if the 
viscosity of the liquid crystal composition is reduced, 
the response speed can be improved so that a display will 
be possible at a practical speed even at a low  
 
temperature. Further, if the response speed may be at a 
level
