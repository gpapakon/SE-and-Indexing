Disclosed is the characterization and purification of DNA encoding numerous polypeptides factors useful for the inhibition of cell (particularly, Schwann cell) proliferation. These factors are useful for the treatment of neural tumors. Also disclosed are the DNA sequences encoding novel polypeptides which may have use as agents which inhibit cell proliferation. Methods for the synthesis, purification, and testing of both known and novel polypeptides for their use as therapeutic and diagnostic aids in the treatment of diseases are also provided. Methods are also provided for the use of these polypeptides for the preparation of antibody probes. Such probes have diagnostic and therapeutic use in diseases involving neural and glial cells.

<DESCRIPTION>
INHIBITORS OF CELL PROLIFERATION, THEIR PREPARATION AND USEBackground of the Invention The invention relates to compounds which are inhibitors of cell proliferation, having antiproliferative activity on a variety of cell types.Many vertebrate cell types respond to diffusible growth factors as stimuli which regulate proliferation. A number of these growth factors and their cognate receptors have been purified, and the genes encoding them have been cloned and characterized (Sporn and Roberts eds. (1991) Peptide Growth Factors and their Receptors I and II. Springer-Verlaz, New York). Many cancers, which are diseases of cell proliferation, involve genetic modifications which affect the nature of the growth factor-receptor interaction. Such modifications can result in unregulated stimulation of proliferation in the receptor bearing target cell. Additionally, certain tumors of the nervous system involve the regulation of proliferation of cells from both the central and peripheral nervous systems.The glial cells of vertebrates constitute the specialized connective tissue of the central and peripheral nervous systems. Important glial cells include the peripheral Schwann cells which provide both the metabolic support for neurons and the myelin sheathing around the axons of certain peripheral neurons, thereby forming individual nerve fibers. Schwann cells support neurons and provide a sheath effect by forming concentric layers of membrane around adjacent neuron axons, twisting as they develop around the axons. These myelin sheaths are a susceptible element of many nerve fibers. Damage to Schwann cells, or failure in growth and development, can be associated with significant dÎµmyelination or nerve degeneration characteristic of a number of peripheral nervous system diseases and disorders. In the development 

of the nervous system, it has become apparent that cells require various factors to regulate their division and growth. Several regulators of Schwann cell proliferation and differentiation have been identified. Such factors play an important role in both the development and the regeneration (following injury) of the peripheral nervous system.Brockes et al. ((1984) J. Neuroscience 4.:75-83) describe a protein growth factor present in extracts from bovine brain and pituitary tissue, termed Glial Growth Factor (GGF) . This factor stimulates cultured rat Schwann cells to divide against a background medium containing ten percent fetal calf serum. GGF has been described as having a molecular weight of 31 KD and
