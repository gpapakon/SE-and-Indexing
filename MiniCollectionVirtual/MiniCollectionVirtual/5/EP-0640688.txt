<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a class of 
synthetic RNA molecules and derivatives thereof, 
hereinafter referred to as ribozymes, which possess 
highly specific endoribonuclease activity. A number of naturally occurring RNA molecules 
such as avocardo sunblotch viroid (ASBV), the 
satellite RNAs of tobacco ringspot virus (sTobRV) and 
lucerne transient streak virus (sLTSV), undergo 
self-catalysed cleavage. Such cleavage appears to be 
an essential and unique part of the life cycle of 
these and other RNAs. Self-catalysed RNA cleavage reactions share a 
common requirement for divalent metal ions and 
neutral or higher pH, and result in the production of 
RNA with termini possessing 5' hydroxyl and 2',3' 
cyclic phosphate groups (Prody et al., Science 231: 
1577-1580 (1986) and Buzayan et al., Virology 151: 
186-199 (1986)). The cleavage reactions are 
catalysed by the RNAs themselves, presumably as a  
 
result of conformation bringing reactive groups into 
close proximity. The sites of self-catalysed 
cleavage in naturally occurring RNAs are located 
within highly conserved regions of RNA secondary 
structure (Buzayan et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 
83: 8859-8862 (1986) and Forster, A.C. and Symons, 
R.H. Cell 50: 9-16 (1987)). Experiments we have carried out on the satellite 
RNAs of tobacco ringspot virus (sTobRV) have led to 
the design of novel endoribonucleases (hereinafter 
referred to as "ribozymes"), that is, enzymes 
comprised of RNA which catalyse specific cleavage of 
RNA target molecules. The term ribozyme as used in the specification 
refers to molecules comprised wholly of RNA or 
derivatives thereof. The ribozymes of the present invention are 
distinct from the RNA endoribonuclease which occurs 
naturally in Tetrahymena Fhermophila (known as the 
IVS, or L-19 IVS RNA) and which has been extensively 
described by Thomas Cech and collaborators (Zaug, 
A.J. et al, Science (1984) 224: 574-578; Zaug, A.J. 
and Cech, T.R., Science (1986) 231: 470-475; Zaug, 
A.J., et al, Nature (1986) 324: 429-433; published 
International patent application No. WO 88/04300 by 
University Patents Inc.). The Cech endoribonuclease 
has an eight base pair active site which hybridizes 
to a target RNA sequence whereafter cleavage of the 
target RNA takes place, with a requirement for free 
guanosine or guanosine derivatives. The fragments 
which arise from cleavage contain terminal 5' 
phosphate and 3' hydroxyl groups. The limited number 
of nucleotides available for hybridization to an RNA 
substrate
