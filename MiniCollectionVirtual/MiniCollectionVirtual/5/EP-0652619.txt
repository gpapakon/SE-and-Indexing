<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a sleeve with a cap, which consists of a cap body (2) and a sealing body (3, 19, 29) at the end. This sealing body (3, 19, 29) has mechanical holding devices (6) for mutual fixing of the cap body (2) and the sealing body (3, 19, 29). A sealing system is arranged independently of this, and consists of a variable volume sealing groove with a sealing ring (5). The groove volume is reduced by reducing the sealing groove volume with the aid of clamping elements (7, 23-24, 31), as a result of which the sealing ring (5) is pressed against the inner wall of the cap body (2) to produce a seal.

sealing manner by means of deformation against the inner 
wall of the hood body (2),
 
characterized in that
 
a pressure disc (20) is arranged, as a groove wall which 

can move in the axial direction of the hood sleeve (1), 
at a distance from and parallel to the disc-shaped 

sealing body (19), in that the bottom of the groove is 
formed by concentrically circumferential guide edges (21, 

22) of the pressure disc (20) and of the sealing body 
(19), in that tension springs (27) are arranged between 

the pressure disc (20) and the sealing body (19), and in 
that at least one clamping element (23-24), effecting the 

spreading of the tension springs (27), is arranged 
between the pressure disc (20) and the sealing body (19). 
Hood sleeve, comprising a hood body and a sealing 
body at the ends having cable inlets and an annular 

sealing system between the hood body and the sealing 
body, a holding device (6) for the mutual fixing of the 

hood body (2) and of the sealing body (3, 19, 29) being 

arranged such that the sealing system is arranged 
circumferentially on the sealing body (3, 19, 29) and 

comprises a sealing groove, which can be reduced in 
volume, and an elastic sealing ring (5) which is inserted 

into this sealing groove, and such that at least one 
groove wall (4, 20, 30) for reducing the groove volume by 

means of clamping elements (7, 23-24) can be moved in
