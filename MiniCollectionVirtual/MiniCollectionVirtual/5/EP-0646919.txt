<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic tape cassette including a pair of hubs which 
are rotatably supported in an internal opening defined between 

upper and lower half portions of a body of the cassette and on 
which a magnetic tape is wound, and friction sheets provided 

between the tops and bottoms of the hubs and the upper and 
lower inside surfaces of the cassette. Each of the sheets 

includes projecting portions having substantially rectangular 
cross sections and extending substantially in a longitudinal 

direction of the sheet so that the protruding portions reach 
both ends of the sheet and at least two hub holes are located 

between the protruding portions. Each of the side edges of the 
top of each of the protruding portions is wavily curved and the 

width of the protruding portions is uniform. The hubs and the 
tape are supported by the tops of the protruding portions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magnetic tape cassette,
particularly to a magnetic tape cassette in which friction
sheets are provided between the body of the cassette and hubs
on which a magnetic tape is wound.A magnetic tape cassette is widely used as a
record/playback medium with an audio apparatus such as a
magnetic tape recorder. In the cassette, a pair of flangeless
hubs on which a magnetic tape is wound are rotatably supported
in a cassette body composed of an upper and a lower half
portion. When the magnetic tape cassette is used with a tape
recorder, the magnetic tape is typically repeatedly and
frequently run and stopped as the recorder is put in a
recording or playback mode, a stop mode, a rapid running mode,
a stop mode, etc. For that reason, friction sheets are
provided on the inside surfaces of the upper and lower body
portions of the cassette. The friction sheets have surfaces
having properties so as to maintain good running properties of the
magnetic tape good and to apply an appropriate tensile force to
the tape during the running thereof and prevent the tape from
undergoing slackening or the like when the tape is stopped.For this purpose, each of the friction sheets is a thin
sheet of a soft synthetic resin. Some such friction sheets are
processed for prevention of static electric charging, and are 
embossed, curved appropriately, or are provided with protruding
portions of appropriate height. For a friction sheet of very
small thickness, such protruding portions serve to effectively
increase the thickness of the sheet and enhance its function of
supporting the hubs and the magnetic tape to prevent them from
moving in the direction of thickness of the cassette. However,
friction sheets having such protruding portions have certain
problems, as will now be described.Friction sheets having protruding portions can be broadly divided
into two types, as shown in Figs 6 and 7. The friction sheet 30 of
the type shown in Fig. 6 and known for example from JP-U 56-16705
(according to the precharacterizing part of claim 1) has two
protruding portions 37 and 38 having nearly U-shaped cross sections
and straightly extending in parallel with each other in the
longitudinal direction of the sheet so that the protruding portions
extend to both ends 3a and 3b of the sheet and the hub holes of the
sheet are located between the protruding portionsThe friction sheet 40 of the type shown in Fig. 7 has two
protruding portions 47 and 48 having nearly rectangular or
U-shaped cross sections and straightly

<CLAIMS>
A magnetic tape cassette (1) including a pair of hubs (9) which are rotatably
supported in an internal opening defined between upper and lower half portions

(12, 13) of a body of said cassette (1) and on which a magnetic tape is wound, and
friction sheets (10) provided between the tops of said hubs (9) and the upper inside

surfaces of said cassette (1) and between the bottoms of said hubs (9) and the
lower inside surfaces of said cassette (1), wherein each of said friction sheets (10) includes

protruding portions (17, 18) extending substantially in the longitudinal direction of
said sheet (10) so that said protruding portions (17, 18) reach both longitudinal

ends of said sheet (10) and at least two hub holes (4) are located between said
protruding portions (17, 18) and said hubs (9) and said tape are supported by tops

(70, 80) of said protruding portions (17, 18),
characterized in that
said protruding portions (17, 18) have substantially rectangular cross sections,
each of said protruding portions (17, 18) is wavily curved, and
the width (W) of each of said wavily curved protruding portions (17, 18) is uniform.
The magnetic tape cassette according to claim 1,
wherein the protruding portions (17,18) are shaped

symetrically with respect to each other about the hub
holes (4) of the friction sheet (10) in the direction of

the width thereof.
The magnetic tape according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the
height of said protruding portions (17,18) is in a range

of 0.1 to 0.3 mm.
