<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a silver halide color 
photographic light-sensitive material and, particularly, to a 
silver halide color photographic light-sensitive material 
having a high sensitivity, an excellent processing variation 
resistance and an excellent raw-stock preservability. A silver halide color photographic light-sensitive 
material has usually contained each of yellow, magenta and 
cyan couplers in combination. Among the couplers, a 5-pyrazolone 
type magenta coupler has widely been used for the 
magenta coupler. The 5-pyrazolone type magenta couplers have 
had various color-reproduction problems, because a dye 
produced in a development has had a side absorption around 
430nm. For solving the problems, a novel magenta coupler has 
been researched so far. For example, such a pyrazolotriazole  
 
type coupler as disclosed in US Patent Nos. 3,725,065, 
3,810,761, 3,758,309 and 3,725,067 have been developed. The above-mentioned couplers have had many advantages 
such as that few side absorption may be produced, that a color 
reproduction may advantageously be displayed and that a 
preservability may be excellent in the presence of formalin. However, the pyrazolotriazole type couplers have been 
relatively lower in sensitivity as compared to any 
conventional 5-pyrazolone type magenta couplers, because those 
particular type magenta couplers have had an inhibition 
property in themselves. It has also become apparent that they 
have raised such a problem that the sensitivity thereof has 
been lowered in the course of preserving a coated sample at a 
high temperature and high humidity. It has further come out that the pyrazolotriazole type 
couplers have raised such a problem that they have had a 
relatively lower processing variation resistance as compared 
to any conventional 5-pyrazolone type coupler and, inter alia, 
that they have produced a particularly serious pH variation. For a silver halide color photographic light-sensitive 
material containing a pyrazolotriazole type magenta coupler, 
it has therefore been demanded to provide a technique not only 
for making a sensitivity higher and making a preservability 
excellent, but also for reducing a processing variation 
including particularly a pH variation.  It is, therefore, an object of the invention to provide a 
silver halide color photographic light-sensitive material not 
only high in sensitivity, excellent in processing variation 
resistance, but also excellent in raw stock preservability. The above-mentioned object of the invention
