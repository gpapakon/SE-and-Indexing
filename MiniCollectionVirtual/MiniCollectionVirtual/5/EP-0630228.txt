<DESCRIPTION>
A valued aspect of man is the appearance of his skin. A greasy skin, e.g. after a busy 
day or following physical exercise, is often considered an annoyance, even though it is 
temporary and does not indicate any health problem. The present invention concerns the cosmetical 
use of an agent for regulating the greasiness of the skin, particular novel physical forms 
of said agent, cosmetic compositions comprising said agent, processes for preparing said 
agent and compositions, and a method of cosmetically regulating the greasiness of the 
skin. The present invention is concerned with the cosmetical use of a compound having the formula 
 
wherein R represents methyl or ethyl, preferably ethyl, or a cosmetically acceptable acid 
addition salt thereof, for regulating the greasiness of the skin of human beings. The present invention is also concerned with a method of cosmetically regulating the greasiness 
of the skin of human beings, which comprises administering topically to the skin of said 
human beings a compound having the formula (cis)-(I), or a cosmetically acceptable acid 
addition salt thereof, in an amount effective in cosmetically regulating the greasiness of 
the skin. The compound (I) can be applied to the skin when necessary or convenient, e.g. at 
each washing occasion or thereafter. The topical administration may be repeated until a 
cosmetically beneficial reduction of the greasiness of the skin is obtained. No special  
 
precautions are needed other than those which normally apply when using cosmetic 
agents. The compounds of formula (I), (±)-methyl- or ethyl-cis-4-[4-[[2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-2-(1H-imidizol-1-ylmethyl)-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl]methoxy]phenyl]-1-piperazinecarboxylate used in the method of the present invention are known agents and 
their preparation as well as their properties are described in US-4,335,125. The compound of formula (I) is preferably used as such or in a cosmetically 
acceptable acid addition salt form. Said salt forms can conveniently be prepared by 
treating the base form with an appropriate acid such as, for example, hydrohalic acids, 
e.g. hydrochloric or hydrobromic acid; sulfuric acid; nitric acid; phosphoric acid and the 
like; or organic acids, such as, for example, acetic, propanoic, hydroxyacetic, 
2-hydroxy-propanoic, 2-oxopropanoic, ethanedioic, propanedioic, butanedioic, 
(Z)-2-butenedioic, (E)-2-butenedioic, 2-hydroxybutanedioic, 2,3-dihydroxybutanedioic, 
2-hydroxy-1,2,3-propanetricarboxylic, methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic, 
benzenesulfonic,
