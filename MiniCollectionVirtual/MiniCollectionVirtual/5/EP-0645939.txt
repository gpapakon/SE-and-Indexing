<ABSTRACT>
An intelligent call processing system is arranged so that each originating 
switch is provided with a local database called a "global title translation (GTT)" 

database, which receives a query fully identifying the calling station, typically in 
terms of its 10 digit number (i.e., three digit [NPA]
 area code, three digit [NXX] 

exchange, and four digit line identification). The GTT database responds to the query 
by identifying the particular NCP in the telecommunications network that contains 

the appropriate record for completing the call. If the GTT database does not contain 
an entry, or an error condition exists, a further query is launched to a centralized 

database, called a "universal global translation (UGT)" database. The UGT database 
then ret
rieves information identifying the particular NCP in the telecommunications 
network that contains the appropriate record for completing the call, and provides 

this information to the originating switch. The same information may also be 
provided to and stored in the GTT database, so that the GTT database is "self 

provisioning".

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to intelligent call processing, in which 
individual telephone calls are provided with different features depending upon 
characteristics of the call, including, particularly, the identity of the calling station, 
and, in particular, to such processing in which the entire identity of the calling 
station is used to ascertain the parameters and information for providing appropriate 
features to each call. Various intelligent call processing systems have been developed to 
provide customized features to users of telecommunications systems. Certain 
intelligent communications systems differentiate call treatment based upon the 
dialed or called number. For example, calls to an 800 subscriber are recognized in 
an originating switch, which then queries an associated database, called a network 
control point (NCP) and retrieves information specific to that subscriber. This 
enables each 800 subscriber to provide different routing or call treatment that best 
suits that subscriber. For example, one subscriber can use call time of day or day of 
week routing, another subscriber can use a different routing pattern, and a third 
subscriber can offer different service depending upon the traffic conditions at various 
call processing centers. Other intelligent systems, including "virtual private network" or 
"software defined network" (SDN) systems, offer customized features suited to the 
calling party or the calling station. As an example of such systems, outbound calls 
from an executive of a subscriber may receive different treatment from calls 
originated by another employee. To provide the appropriate call treatment, 
information identifying the calling party and the calling station is today routed from 
an originating switch that receives a call, to a particular NCP which holds the call 
processing record (CPR) associated with the calling party. This routing requires that 
the caller's automatic number identification (ANI) information be mapped into a 
customer identifier and the network address of the NCP with the corresponding CPR. 
When the number of ANIs is small, this translation may be done using a minimum 
amount of information, usually the first three to six digits. However, as the number 
of subscribed ANIs increases, studies have shown that, in some instances, the first 
NCP to receive the query does not have the correct record. In that event, the query 
must be rerouted to the correct NCP, via the SS7 signaling network which  
 
interconnects the NCP's. This
