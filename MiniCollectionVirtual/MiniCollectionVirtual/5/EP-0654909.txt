<ABSTRACT>
In an encoder and a decoder which use a code excitation linear prediction coding (CELP) method, there is 
provided a means which adaptively transforms on the basis of voice analysis information (LPC) code vectors outputted 

from the code book in which the stored codes are fixed, such as a statistic excitation code book among the code books 
prepared as excitation signals, thus generating high-quality reproduced voice at a low encoding speed. Further, in 

order to obtain similar effects, a pulse excitation code book consisting of isolated impulses is provided in addition 
to the adaptive excitation code book and statistic excitation code book. Hence, the statistic excitation code book and 

pulse excitation code book can be selectively used, and the vocal tract parameters are line spectrum pair parameters.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an encoder and a decoder 
based on the code excitation linear predictive coding 
(CELP) system. Conventionally, as a high efficient coding system 
for speech signal including audible signal in a field 
of digital transportable communication system, a code 
excitation linear predictive coding and its 
modification, that is, a vector sum excitation linear 
predictive coding system (VSELP) have been used. The 
coding apparatus which uses the code excitation linear 
predictive coding (CELP) is disclosed in, for example, 
N.S. Jayant and J.H.Chen,"Speech Coding with 
Time-varying Bit Allocation to Excitation and LPC 
Parameters", Proc. ICASSP, pp65-68, 1989. A fundamental construction of the coding system 
relative to the speech signal is to obtain vocal tract 
parameters representing vocal tract properties and 
excitation source parameters representing excitation 
source information. In the recent CELP system, an 
excited signal as a excitation source information is 
encoded by means of both an adaptive excitation  
 
codevectors, which contribute to stochastically 
stronger periodic excitation signal and stochastic 
excitation codevectors which contribute to stochastic 
less periodic random excitation signal, and then the 
coded excitation signals are stored in a codebook, and 
an optimum adaptive excitation codevectors and 
stochastic excitation codevectors are found out in each 
codebook so that weighted error power sum between an 
input speech vector and synthetic speech vector becomes 
minimum. Then, whatever it is of a forward-type coding 
system which obtains vocal tract parameters from an 
input speech vector or of a backward-type coding system 
which obtains vocal tract parameters from synthetic 
speech vectors, at least the excitation source 
parameters, that is, adaptive excitation code and 
stochastic excitation code information are transmitted. By utilizing the code excitation linear predictive 
(CELP) system as described above, it is known that a 
high quality regenerated speech signals are obtained at 
a coding rate of 6 kbit/s to 8 kbit/s. However, some communication systems require lower 
coding rate, for example 4kbit/s or less. In such a 
lower coding rate, regardless of being the forward type 
which transmits both vocal tract parameters and 
excitation source parameters or being the backward type 
which transmits excitation source parameters, the 
number of coded bits which are assigned to the  
 
excitation source parameters is smaller and the number 
of
