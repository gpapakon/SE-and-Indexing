Shaped body comprising pieces of cellulose-containing material and
a thermoplastic synthetic resin material, the pieces of cellulose-containing

material being bonded together by means of the thermoplastic synthetic
resin by the action of pressure and temperature, characterised in that the

shaped body comprises pieces (1, 2) of synthetic resin material and/or
synthetic resin film material and pieces or strips (3) of a cellulose-containing

material connected together by the action of pressure and
temperature.
Shaped body according to claim 1, characterised in that the pieces
(2) of synthetic resin film and pieces (1) of synthetic resin are partially or

wholly melted together.
Shaped body according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the
pieces (3) of cellulose-containing material are rigidly bonded in between

the pieces (2) of synthetic resin film and pieces (1) of synthetic resin
material and firmly bonded to these.
Shaped body according to one of a foregoing claims, characterised
in that the surface of the shaped body is multi-coloured and has regions

with deformed structures ( 4).
Shaped body according to one of the foregoing claims,
characterised in that the pieces of synthetic resin material originate from

scrap material, in particular synthetic resin film scrap. 
Shaped body according to one of the foregoing claims,
characterised in at the cellulose-containing material is paper, in particular

scrap paper.
Shaped body according to claim 6, characterised in that the
proportion of paper amounts to 20 to 40 %.
Shaped body according to claim 7, characterised in that the pieces
of paper have a three-dimensional form, produced for example by

crumpling.
Shaped body according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in
that the cellulose-containing material comprises a layer of aluminium and

a thermoplastic synthetic resin.
Shaped body according to one of the foregoing claims,
characterised in that it has a profiled spatial form.
Shaped body according to one of the foregoing claims,
characterised in that it has a deep-drawn spatial form.
Shaped body according to one of the foregoing claims,
characterised in that air bubbles or voids are present between the pieces

(1, 2, 3) of synthetic resin and cellulose-containing material.
Process for manufacturing a shaped body according to one or more
of the foregoing claims, in which pieces (1) of synthetic resin and /or

pieces (2) of synthetic resin film and pieces (3) of cellulose-containing
material are mixed together or deposited in layers to form a track and are 

bonded together by the action of pressure and temperature to form a
coherent rigid shaped body.
Process according to claim 13, characterised in that or alternate
layers of pieces (2) of synthetic resin film and/or pieces (3) of cellulose-containing

material are arranged upon one another.
Process according to claim 13 or 14, characterised in that the
bonding of the synthetic resin material (12) and the cellulose-containing

material (3) takes place by rolling or pressing under the action of pressure
and temperature.
Process according to one of claims 13 to 15, characterised in that
in the manufacture of three-dimensional bodies the layer height of the

track of pieces (1) of synthetic resin and /or pieces (2) of synthetic resin
film and pieces (3) of cellulose-containing material deposited is different

over the area, and the height of the track corresponds approximately to
the profile of the press stamp applied.
