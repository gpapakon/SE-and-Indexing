<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an installation to be used with a device for treating the ground using rotating jet(s) comprising a string of tubes (2) at the base of which is mounted at least one ejection nozzle, this nozzle being supplied with substance to be ejected by means of the string of tubes (2) or of flexible pipes (hoses) (3a, 3b), characterised in that it comprises an enclosure (chamber) (4), provided with at least one orifice (6, 7, 8) fitted with a seal (9, 10, 11) for the passage of the string of tubes and/or of the flexible pipes; a shut-off valve (12) making it possible to close off the borehole, and a pipe (13) for evacuating the substances leaving the borehole, this pipe being coupled up to the said enclosure and provided with an adjustable valve (14) making it possible to alter the flowrate of the said substances.

Installation intended to be used in conjunction with a device for 
treating soils with at least one rotary jet, comprising a string of tubes (2) at the 

base of which at least one ejection nozzle is mounted, this nozzle being supplied 
with material to be ejected by means of the string of tubes (2) or flexible pipes 

(3a, 3b) external to the string of tubes, said installation being characterized in 
that it comprises: 


a chamber (4) arranged at the surface in continuation of the borehole 
and in leaktight connection therewith, this chamber being provided with at least 

one orifice (6, 7, 8) fitted with a sealing gasket (9, 10, 11) for the passage of the 
string of tubes and of the flexible pipes, if present, 
a shut-off valve (12) making it possible to close the borehole 
completely, and 
a conduit (13) for removing the materials leaving the borehole, 
connected to the said chamber and provided with an adjustable valve (14) for 

adjusting the flow rate of said materials in order to avoid the establishment in 
the borehole of an excessive pressure. 
Installation according to Claim 1, characterized in that the control of 
the adjustable removal valve is slaved to the pressure prevailing in the borehole. 
Installation according to Claim 1, characterized in that it further 
comprises a tap (17, 18) for connecting the chamber to a pressurized fluid source. 
Installation according to Claim 1, characterized in that said chamber 
(4) can be dismantled into at least two parts, namely a lower part (4a) equipped 

with said shut-off valve (12) and an upper part (4b) provided with said orifices 
(6, 7, 8).
