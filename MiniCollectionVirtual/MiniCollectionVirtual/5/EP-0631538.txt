<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to improved 
structures and processes for making the same which 
comprise a first structure which comprises a flame 
retardant polyolefin, and a second structure which 
comprises a polyamide which exhibits good fire 
retardant properties. The improved structures find 
particular utility as electrical insulating structures 
for electrical current conductors, namely wires and 
cables. Multi-layer structures typically comprise at least 
two or more layers of materials featuring different 
physical properties, which properties are optimally 
optimized in order to satisfy a particular need at 
hand. The goal of the formation of such structures is 
to provide a structure which is directed to a 
particular need, and wherein the individual layers of 
the structures act to form a composite, and where each 
layer of material contributes to serve the function for 
which the structure is designed. Examples of such 
structures are well known to the art, and include 
composites which are used to form films, wherein each 
layer forming the film may feature a particular 
property, such as impermeability to a gas, or as a 
blocking layer to light or radio energy of a particular 
wavelength. Another example of such a structure may be  
 
those which would be used to form an insulation 
structure for an electrical conductor, where each layer 
forming a jacket about the conductor might feature 
improved abrasion resistance, or improved dielectric 
strength, or the like. Other uses of such structures 
are notorious and known to the art. The use of such multi-layer structures is 
widespread with electrical conductors. These 
conductors typically consist of a wire conductor (which 
is frequently a metal, including copper) which is 
surrounded by a multi-layer structure. Examples of 
such constructions include those taught in U.S. Patents

4,419,538; 4,472,597; 4,510,348; 4,626,619; and 
4,691,082. Therein are disclosed a variety of 
constructions wherein each of the layers may be a 
polymer, a metal, an elastomeric material, a fibrous 
material, etc., where each layer offers a particular 
advantage, i.e., dielectric strength, water 
impermeability, etc. A technical paper titled "Novel Flame Retarded 
Moisture Curable Polyolefin Compounds" by M.J. Keogh 
and M.E. Lowell presented on March 12-15, 1989 
describes the use of various types of flame retardant 
polyolefins in wire and cable constructions. Two favorable materials which may be used
