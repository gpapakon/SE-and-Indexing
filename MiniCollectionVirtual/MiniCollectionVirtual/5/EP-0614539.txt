<ABSTRACT>
The method proposed is intended to minimize the technical complexity required to integrate optical components into fibre-optic systems. This is done by placing an optical component (29) in a die (10) with positioning elements (13) which ensure that the optical component (29) is correctly aligned, and the optical component (29) is embedded in a curable liquid which, when solid, forms the cover (25).

Method for producing a cover for an integrated 
optical circuit, in which 


a.) a mould punch (10) is provided, which is provided 
with first alignment elements (13), 
b.) the mould punch (10) having second alignment elements 
(15), 
c.) an optical component (29) is placed onto the mould 
punch (10) and is laterally fixed by the first alignment 

elements (13) with micrometer accuracy, 
d.) the cover (25) is produced by casting a curable 
liquid around the optical component (29) and the second 

alignment elements (15) and by subsequent release from 
the mould punch, 
 
the impression of the second alignment elements (15) 

producing a fixing possibility with micrometer accuracy 
relative to the optical component (29) for a further 

component, in particular an optical fibre or a substrate 
for an integrated optical circuit, in the cover (25). 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the optical component (29) and the alignment 

elements (13, 15) are provided at least partially with 
oblique side faces. 
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the mould punch (10) is provided with further 

alignment elements (14). 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the mould punch (10) is provided with 

mould elements for producing a Bragg structure. 
Method according to Claim 3 or 4, characterized  
 

in that after the release from the mould punch (10), 
electrically conductive material is applied to partial 

areas of the underside of the cover (29), and in that 
contacts between the optical component (29) and connecting 

lines (31) are formed by the cutouts (32) produced by 
means of the further alignment elements (14). 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterized 
in that the optical component (29) is fastened by 

its top side to a carrier plate (16) before being placed 
onto the mould punch (10). 
Method according to Claim 6, characterized in 
that an additional plate is arranged between the optical 

component (29) and the carrier plate (16).
