<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a remote identification device. An interrogator (1) sends a UHF interrogation wave (3) to a responder (2), the interrogation wave (3) being modulated. The responder (2), at each period of the signal for modulating the interrogation wave (3) accumulates the energy transported by the latter, the energy received being converted into voltage for supplying means for coding (37) and transmitting (38) a UHF response wave (4) to the interrogator (1). Application: identification of objects via a radar signal.
