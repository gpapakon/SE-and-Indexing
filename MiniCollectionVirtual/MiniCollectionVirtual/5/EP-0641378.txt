<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to the use of selected modified polyesters known for their soil-release properties as cleaning agents for cotton-containing fabrics, thus being able to provide a cleaning effect on such fabrics after only one laundering cycle, as compared to several cycles when functioning in the soil-release agent mode. The present invention also encompasses detergent compositions containing said modified polyesters and a cellulase enzyme, or a co-dispersing agent and/or a soil-antiredeposition agent.

<DESCRIPTION>
 USE OF MODIFIED POLYESTERS FOR THE WASHING OF COTTON- CONTAINING FABRICSTechnical FieldThe present invention relates to the use of modified polymers known for their soil-release properties, as cleaning agents for cotton-containing fabrics; the invention further relates to certain detergent compositions containing said modified polymers.Background of the inventionProducts used in laundering operation contain a number cr ingredients which provide certain basic benefits. For example, laundry cleaning products are formulated with detergent surfactant systems to remove a variety of soils from clothes during washing. These laundry products can also include ingredients which provide through-the-wash fabric conditioning benefits such as softening and anti-static performance.In addition to standard cleaning, softening and anti-stat:- benefits, laundry detergent can also impart other desirable properties. One is the ability to confer soil release properties to fabrics woven from polyester fibers. The hydrophobic character of polyester fabrics makes their 

laundering difficult , particularly as regards oily soil and oily stains. The oily soil or stain preferentially "wets" the fabric. As a result, the oily soil or stain is difficult to remove in an aqueous laundering process.Certain polyesters have been found to be particularly useful as soil release compounds in laundry detergent composition. During the laundering operation, these soil release polyesters adsorb onto the surface of fabrics immersed in the wash solution. The adsorbed polyesters then form a hydrophilic film which remains on the fabric after it is removed from the wash solution and dried. This film can be renewed by subsequent washing of the fabric with a detergent composition containing the soil release polyesters.Such polyesters are disclosed in e.g. US Patent 4 116 885 and 4 711730.Continuous effort has been put against improving soil release polyesters; in e.g. EPA 272 033 have been described such improved polyesters. More recently, EPA 311 372 has described further improved soil release agents consisting of sulfoaroyl end-capped polyesters.It has now been surprisingly found that certain modified polyesters described in EPA 311 342 not only act as a soil release agents on polyester fabrics, but are also able to remove soils from cotton-containing fabrics and to disperse such soils, during the main laundering cycle of a laundry process.It has further been found that the use of the modified polyesters herein in combination with cellulase enzymes

5. A detergent composition or additive according to Claim 1, 2, 3 or 4 further comprising a cellulase enzyme.
6. The use of a modified polyester, said polyester being a random copolymer of dimethyl terephtalate, dimethyl sulfoisophtalate ethylene glycol and 1-2 propane diol. the end groups consisting primarily of 


 sulfobenzate and secondarily of mono esters of ethylene glycol and/or propane-diol, as a cleaning agent for cotton-containing fabrics, said fabrics being contacted with an aqueous laundry liquor containing said compounds and subjected to one laundering cycle.
7. The use of Claim 6 wherein said polyester contains about 46% by weight of dimethyl terephtalic acid, about 16% by weight of propane -1.2 diol, about 10% by weight ethylene glycol, about 13% by weight of sulfo benzoid acid and about 15% by weight of sulfoisophtalic acid, and has a molecular weight between 2,500 and 3,500.
8. The use of Claim 6 or 7 wherein said polyester is combined with a cellulase enzyme.
9. The use of any one of Claims 6-8 wherein said polyester is incorporated into a detergent composition including other detersive ingredients, at a level of compound of from 0.025% to 10% by weight of the composition.
10. The use of any one of claims 6-8 wherein said polyester is incorporated in a detergent additive composition for the pre-laundering of cotton- containing fabrics.
11. The use of Claim 9 or 10 wherein said detergent composition or additive composition is put in a container able to release the composition at the start of the laundering cycle or of the pre-laundering cycle, and said container is placed in the drum of a washing machine, together with the fabrics to be laundered and/or pre-laundered.
