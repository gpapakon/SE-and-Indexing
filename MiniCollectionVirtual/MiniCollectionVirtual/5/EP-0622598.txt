<ABSTRACT>
In order to provide a controlled discharge of fines falling through the grate (12) of a grate cooler by means of at least one conveying member (17) with which a long service life and overall a comparatively low, specific energy requirement can be expected, it is proposed according to the invention to allow the fines conveying member (17) to only run from time to time instead of continuously, in the course of which the fines collecting funnel (14) which is arranged under the cooling grate (12) and in which most of the fines accumulate controls the switch-on action for the conveying member (17) upon reaching its maximum fines level (18), whereupon this fines collecting funnel (14) and subsequently via programmed control all other fines collecting funnels (15, etc.) are likewise emptied of fines, whereupon the fines conveying member (17) is switched off and is switched on again only when the maximum signal of the fines collecting funnel (14) filling up first again is obtained.
