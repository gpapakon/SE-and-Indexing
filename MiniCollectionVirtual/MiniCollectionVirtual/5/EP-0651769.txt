<DESCRIPTION>
 LEUKAEMIA INHIBITORY FACTOR-BINDING PROTEINThe present invention relates to a Leukaemia Inhibitory Factor-Binding Protein (LBP) and more particularly to a soluble LBP, uses thereof and compositions containing same.Leukaemia Inhibitory Factor (LDF) is a polyfunctional glycoprotein with actions on a broad range of tissue and cell types, including induction of differentiation in a number of myeloid leukaemic cell lines, suppression of differentiation in normal embryonic stem cells, stimulation of proliferation of osteoblasts and DA-1 haemopoietic cells and potentiation of the proliferative action of mterleukin-3 (IL-3) on megakaryocyte precursors- Functionally, it is able to switch autonomic nerve signalling from adrenergic to cholinergic mode, stimulate calcium release from bones, stimulate the production of acute phase proteins by hepatocytes and induce loss of fat deposits by inhibiting lipoprotein lipase-mediated lipid transport into adipocytes1.This array of actions is puzzling since it is difficult to conceive of any situation that would require a co-ordinated response in all the known target tissues of LIF. Actions of LIF, therefore, are probably designed to be restricted by co-localisation of LIF-producing cells and LIF-responsive cells, with tight regulation of LIF production. However, such an arrangement is likely to result in some release of LIF into the circulatory system including blood and other bodily fluids.In work leading up to the present invention, the inventors discovered a LEF- binding protein in serum which is capable of inhibiting the biological activity of LIF. The identification of this LIF antagonist will now permit greater control in LIF therapy and to prevent any systemic effects of locally administered LIF which are not therapeutically desirable. It also provides a new agent useful in the treatment of LIF associated diseases or conditions. In a particular embodiment, 

the inventors have discovered that the inhibitory effect of the LIF-binding protein may be more pronounced in heterologous systems, i.e. where the LIF-binding protein from one mammal is used to inhibit LIF in another mammal.Accordingly, one aspect of the present invention provides a LIF-binding protein (LBP) in soluble form and isolatable from a mammal.More particularly, the present invention is directed to an isolated LBP in soluble form and obtainable from a first mammalian species, said LBP capable of inhibiting the ability of LIF from a second mammalian species to induce differentiation of Ml myeloid
