<ABSTRACT>
An optical emitter for common transmission of analog and digital signals is specified which, although it has an optical transmission component (5) containing a laser, shows no increased bit error rate in the transmission of the digital signals as a result of so-called "clipping". Clipping, i.e. negative overdriving of the laser to below the laser threshold, which arises due to structural interference from the analog signal carriers, is prevented by a limiter (8) which is connected upstream of the modulation input of the optical transmission component (5). The limiter contains a time-variant network which applies a pre-defined minimum voltage to the modulation input whenever a comparator (7) detects that the modulation voltage has fallen below a pre-defined threshold.

An optical transmitter for the joint transmission of
an analogue signal mixture and digital signals, with

preparation circuits (1, 2) for supplying the analogue
signal mixture and the digital signals, and with an optical

transmitting component (5) which contains a laser and whose
output signal is modulated with the signals to be

transmitted,

   
characterised in that
 an amplitude limiter (8) is
connected to a modulation input of the optical

transmitting component (5), which amplitude limiter is
actuated by a threshold circuit (7) when the amplitude

of the analogue signal mixture is below a given
threshold, and that the analogue signal mixture is fed

to the optical transmitting component (5) via the
amplitude limiter (8).
An optical transmitter according to Claim 1,

   
characterised in that
 the analogue signal mixture
is fed across the amplitude limiter (8) and that the

digital signals are added to the analogue signal
mixture, which is limited by the amplitude limiter

(8), before the optical transmitting component (5) is
affected.
An optical transmitter according to Claim 1 or 2,

characterised in that
 the amplitude limiter (8) connects
the modulation input of the laser, or of an external

modulator optically coupled to the laser, to an impressed
potential which ensures the operation of the laser as soon

as the threshold circuit (7), which is also supplied with
the modulation signal to be limited, determines that the

modulation signal undershoots a predetermined threshold
permitting the operation of the laser. 
An optical transmitter according to Claim 3,

   
characterised in that
 the analogue signal mixture
to be limited in amplitude is fed to the amplitude

limiter (8) with a time delay.
An optical transmitter according to Claim 3 or 4,

characterised in that
 the output of the threshold circuit
(7) is connected to a detector circuit (10), which

evaluates the frequency with which the threshold is
undershot, and as a function thereof changes the level of

the signals fed to the optical transmitting component (5)
via the amplitude limiter (8).
