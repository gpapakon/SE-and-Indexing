<ABSTRACT>
A control valve (300) for an antiroll suspension for a vehicle, the valve having a body (302), sliding valve element (306) which is coupled to a pendulum arm (94) through a linkage (146, 332, 334) so that the valve element slides when the pendulum moves on cornering of the vehicle, the valve including a pressure inlet port (352) between lands (336, 344), a return port (356) and outlet ports (342, 350) which are coupled to hydraulic rams (44) in the vehicle suspension, whereby the valve element operates to control pressure at the outlet ports so as to actuate the rams to thereby reduce body roll on the vehicle. Restricted flow through ducts (340, 348) past pistons (312, 314) and end chambers to ducts (360, 366) and return port (356) provides an increasing pressure differential to generate forces on the valve element (306) which tend to oppose the displacement of the valve element (306) whereby the valve element (306) moves to an equilibrium position which is dependent on the forces transmitted to it from the pendulum arm (94). An antiroll suspension for a vehicle including the valve is also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a vehicle suspension system
and a control valve therefor.It is known that when a vehicle such as an automobile
travels around a corner, centrifical forces acting on the
vehicle tend to cause body roll which if severe can cause
instability. The problem is more pronounced with vehicles
which have a relatively high centre of gravity such as
trucks or vans.Australian Patent No. 618,732 (corresponding to WO
88/07455) discloses an antiroll suspension system for a
vehicle. The system includes a pendulum operated control
valve. The specification discloses several forms of control
valve. The general object of the present invention is to
provide an improved and simplified control valve which can
be used in antiroll suspension systems of the type
disclosed in said Australian Patent No. 618,732.Another object of the present invention is to provide
an antiroll suspension for a vehicle incorporating the new
form of control valve.GB-A-1478033, acknowledged in the preamble of the
independent claim, discloses a self-centering hydraulic
control valve having a valve element actuated by a ball
head located in a chamber which is in fluid communication
with a hydraulic inlet with opposed springs being required
to act on the valve element in order to achieve an
equilibrium position thereof.According to the present invention, however, there is
provided a control valve for an antiroll suspension for a
vehicle, said control valve comprising:
a valve body having an inlet port and first and second
outlet ports and return port means, a valve element mounted
for sliding movement in a bore of the valve body, a
pendulum and coupling means for translating rotational
movement of the pendulum about a pendulum axis to linear
displacement of the valve element relative to the valve
body to thereby selectively control the hydraulic fluid
pressure at the outlet ports in the valve body; 
wherein linear displacement of the valve element in a
first direction from a neutral position causes a relatively
high pressure at the first outlet port and a relatively low
pressure at the second outlet port and linear displacement
of the valve element in a second direction from the neutral
position causes a relatively high pressure at the second
outlet port and a relatively low pressure at the first
outlet port, and wherein the bore includes first and second
recesses which co-operate with first and second valve faces
on the valve element such that in the neutral position of
the valve element hydraulic fluid in use passes from the
inl

A control valve for an antiroll suspension for a
vehicle, said control valve (300) comprising:


a valve body (302) having an inlet port (352) and
first and second outlet ports (342,350) and return port

means (331,361), a valve element (306) mounted for sliding
movement in a bore (304) of the valve body, a pendulum (94,

96) and coupling means (324,334) for translating rotational
movement of the pendulum about a pendulum axis (138) to

linear displacement of the valve element (306) relative to
the valve body (302) to thereby selectively control the

hydraulic fluid pressure at the outlet ports (342,350) in
the valve body;

wherein linear displacement of the valve element in a
first direction from a neutral position causes a relatively

high pressure at the first outlet port (342) and a
relatively low pressure at the second outlet port (350) and

linear displacement of the valve element in a second
direction from the neutral position causes a relatively

high pressure at the second outlet port (350) and a
relatively low pressure at the first outlet port (342), and

wherein the bore includes first and second recesses (338,
346) which co-operate with first and second valve faces

(336, 344) on the valve element such that in the neutral
position of the valve element hydraulic fluid in use passes

from the inlet port (352) through said recesses (338,346)
to said return port means (331,361) and the first and

second outlet ports are at substantially the same pressure,
with the pendulum axis (138) being parallel to a forward

direction of movement of the vehicle and transverse

pendulum (94, 96) being arranged to assist in maintaining
