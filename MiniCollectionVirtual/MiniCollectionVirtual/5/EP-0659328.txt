<ABSTRACT>
A heating unit has a current-flow resistance heating element designed as a massive body, for example as a tube (1) or as a plate. This body made of a semiconducting material carries the object to be heated or leads the medium to be warmed up. A large contact surface for heat transfer is thus made available, and a high efficiency is achieved. The invention may be applied in flow heaters, heating and cooking plates.
