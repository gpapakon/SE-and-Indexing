<ABSTRACT>
An impure methyl tertiary butyl ether product contaminated with 
isobutylene, methanol and water is purified by continuous 

counter-current contact with water and isobutylene in a counter-current 
contact extraction tower to provide an overhead raffinate comprising 

isobutylene, methyl tertiary butyl ether and water and an extract 
comprising methanol, water and a minor amount of methyl tertiary butyl 

ether, the overhead raffinate being separated in a methyl tertiary butyl 
ether purification distillation zone into a lighter distillation 

fraction comprising isobutylene and water and a heavier distillation 
fraction consisting essentially of methyl tertiary butyl ether, the 

lighter distillation fraction being decanted to remove water and to 
provide a distillate isobutylene fraction that is charged to a surge 

drum from which isobutylene is returned to the contact tower.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the manufacture and
isobutylene-assisted purification of methyl tertiary butyl
ether. More particularly, this invention relates to a
process for the manufacture of methyl tertiary butyl ether
from tertiary butyl alcohol and methanol and to the
purification of a methanol-contaminated methyl tertiary
butyl ether intermediate product formed during the
process; the intermediate product being purified by
counter-current contact with water in an extraction tower,
wherein isobutylene is added to the extraction tower to
assist in the formation of a raffinate composed of methyl
tertiary butyl ether, isobutylene and residual water and
an extract comprising methanol, residual isobutylene,
residual methyl tertiary butyl ether and water. Even more particularly, this invention relates to a
method of purification of methanol-contaminated methyl
tertiary butyl ether by counter-current contact with water
in an extraction tower, wherein isobutylene is separately
added to the extraction tower below the point at which the
methanol-contaminated methyl tertiary butyl ether is
introduced in order to selectively strip at least a
portion of the residual methyl tertiary butyl ether from
the extract.Methyl tert-butyl ether is finding increasing use as
a blending component in high octane gasoline as the
current gasoline additives based on lead and manganese are
phased out. Currently all commercial processes for the
manufacture of methyl tert-butyl ether are based upon the
liquid-phase reaction of isobutylene and methanol
catalyzed by a cationic ion-exchange resin.With the expanding use of MTBE as an acceptable
gasoline additive, a growing problem is the availability
of raw materials. Historically, the critical raw material
is isobutylene (Oil and Gas J., June 8, 1987, p. 55). It
would be advantageous, therefore, to have a process to
make MTBE that does not require isobutylene as a building
block. It would be advantageous to have an efficient
process for making MTBE by reaction of methanol with 
tertiary butyl alcohol, since t-butanol (TBA) is readily
available commercially through isobutane oxidation.It is known to react methanol with tertiary butyl
alcohol in the presence of a catalyst in order to produce
methyl tertiary butyl ether. A wide variety of catalysts
have been suggested for this purpose.In US-A-2,282,469 there is disclosed a process for
preparing methyl tertiary butyl ether over a catalyst
comprising Kieselguhr impregnated with phosphoric acid at
elevated temperature. The use of other

A method for the continuous purification of
methyl tertiary butyl ether contaminated with isobutylene,

methanol and water, which comprises:

continuously charging an extraction feed
comprising water, isobutylene, methanol and methyl

tertiary butyl ether to a methanol extraction zone
comprising a counter-current contact tower and

countercurrently contacting said extraction feed therein
with water to provide an organic phase overhead raffinate

comprising isobutylene, methyl tertiary butyl ether and a
minor amount of water and a water phase extract comprising

methanol, water and a minor amount of methyl tertiary
butyl ether and stripping said extract with an isobutylene

tertiary butyl ether therefrom,
continuously charging said raffinate to a methyl

separating said raffinate therein into a lighter

distillation fraction comprising isobutylene and water and
a heavier distillation fraction consisting essentially of

methyl tertiary butyl ether;
continuously charging said lighter distillation
fraction to a decantation separation zone and separating

it therein into a distillate isobutylene fraction and a

distillate isobutylene fraction in a surge drum, 
continuously returning distillate isobutylene
