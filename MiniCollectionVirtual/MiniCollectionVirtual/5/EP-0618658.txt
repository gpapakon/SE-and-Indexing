<ABSTRACT>
A bandgap type, thermal protection circuit for an 
integrated circuit does not require the use of a 

comparator and a voltage divider of the bandgap 
voltage. By contrast, the simplified thermal protection 

circuit of the invention utilizes a first transistor 
for mirroring the current flowing through the bandgap 

circuit through a second transistor that is functionally 
connected between the output node and ground. 

The control terminal of said second transistor is 
connected to a temperature dependent voltage derived 

from the bandgap circuit. The crossing point between 
the characteristic of such a temperature dependent 

voltage and of the V

 characteristic of said second 
transistor versus temperature determining the required

<DESCRIPTION>
In integrated circuits (ICs), especially in power 
ICs, power dissipation may cause the device to reach 
relatively high temperatures. In order to avoid 
degradations phenomena or even worse destructive 
failures of ICs, because of excessive temperature, it 
is often necessary to integrate a dedicated 
protection circuit capable of "switching-off" at 
least a power output portion of the integrated 
circuit where power dissipation primarily occurs, 
whenever a condition of risk is reached. Basically, 
such a thermal protection circuit must have a precise 
triggering threshold, in terms of temperature 
reached by the integrated circuit, and a 
relatively small area requirement, for obvious 
economic reasons. Very many forms of thermal protection circuits are 
known in the art. Basically the desired function of 
the circuit is achieved by integrating a component 
(typically a diode) having a known temperature 
characteristic and using it as a temperature sensor. 
By comparing the temperature dependent voltage across 
the "sensor" with a reference voltage that is stable 
in temperature, a desired temperature triggering 
threshold can be implemented. Almost exclusively, a 
temperature stable, reference voltage is derived from 
a circuit which is commonly known as "BANDGAP" 
circuit. In practice, a fraction of the so-called 
bandgap voltage of the semiconductor is used as a 
stable reference in terms of temperature 
(see for example EP-A-0 511 561). A thermal protection circuit, made according to a 
known approach is depicted in Fig. 1. When the 
voltage (V-) applied to a first input of the 
comparator C1 equals the voltage (V+) applied 
to the other input of the comparator C1, a 
desired transition of the signal present on 
an output node (OUT) occurs. The triggering  
 
temperature T may be determined as follows: 
 
by simplifying and resolving for T: 
The circuit at the left of the dash line in Fig. 1 
is a so-called bandgap circuit. The temperature independent 
voltage that is produced on the so-identified 
"BANDGAP" node, is divided by a precision voltage 
divider R7/R8 and compared with the voltage present 
across the diode Q344. A current substantially identical 
to the current flowing through the bandgap circuit is 
forced through the diode Q344 by the transistor Q9. At 
room temperature, the voltage on the inverting input 
(-) of the comparator C1 is lower than the voltage on 
the noninverting input (+) . With an increase of the 
temperature, the voltage across the diode Q344 decreases 
with a known
