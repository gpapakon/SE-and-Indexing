<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a silver halide
photographic material, and more particularly to a silver halide
photographic material giving no color residue by quick
processing, being excellent in sharpness, and forming less fog
by applying a pressure to the light-sensitive photographic
material before processing.Recently, various electronic image-forming means have
been developed and the image qualities thereof have been
compared with those of silver halide photographic materials.
Also, as the result of the comparison, the high image quality
and the easiness of the silver halide photographic material
have been newly recognized. Accordingly, it has been
investigated to use the silver halide color photographic
materials not only for a printing material of a photograph but
also for a hard copy material of an electronic image. In such
a circumstance, the investigations of improving the sharpness
and the color reproducibility to further increase the image
quality of the silver halide photographic material and
improving the processing time and the processing process for
imparting the easily quick processing to the silver halide
photographic material have been positively made. As to the
increase of the easiness and quickening of processing, by the 
progress of an easy quick processing system as shown in a mini-laboratory
system, print photographs having a very high image
quality have been supplied relatively easily, in a short time,
and at a low cost. Furthermore, by using a silver halide
emulsion having a high content of silver chloride, it has been
made to greatly shorten the processing time and to improve the
processing deviation.As a means for improving the sharpness of a silver
halide photographic material having a reflective support,
various means have hitherto been known. Examples of the means
are 1) the prevention of irradiation by the use of a water-soluble
dye; 2) the halation prevention by the use of colloidal
silver, a mordant dye, a solid fine granular dye, 3) the
increase of the filling ratio of a white pigment in the
laminated resin on a paper support. The dye being used
for the purposes is, as a matter of course, required to not
give bad influences on the photographic properties such as fog,
and is required to quickly be decolored in the
photographic processing steps. Furthermore, it is preferred
that the dye is completely decomposed in a processing liquid
and does not give bad influences such as coloring, to the
processing liquid.As the dyes meeting the aforesaid condition, the
pyrazoloneoxo
