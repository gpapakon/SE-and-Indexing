<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus comprises:
 

a thermal cavity (2) optionally a microwave oven cavity;
 

at least one microwave means (3) for providing microwave 
energy for providing heat in the thermal cavity at 

suitable time(s);
 

at least one first supply means (21, 22, 24), for supplying 
suitably hot air to the thermal cavity at suitable 

time(s); and
 

at least one second supply means (31), for supplying 
suitably cool air, at least a portion of which is able to 

assist in containing and/or directing at least a portion 
of said hot air, so as to provide localisation of at least 

a portion of said hot air in the thermal cavity, and 
optionally to prevent or reduce heat reaching at least a 

portion of the boundary of the thermal cavity.

<DESCRIPTION>
There is continuing need to improve microwave heating,
especially microwave cooking. Various uncooked or precooked food
products may be cooked or further cooked in a conventional
microwave oven or other suitable thermal cavity, using only
microwave energy, but the results may be unappetising. For
example, the use of only microwave energy to cook pastry(s) may
result in the pastry(s) attaining a soggy texture, compared with
the results obtained from a conventional hot air oven or a
conventional combination hot air/microwave oven, but both of these
ovens require preheating to more than 200Â°C and retain heat for a
long time after cooking has ceased.The patent specification US-A-4 409 453 discloses a
microwave oven having a cavity and a microwave means providing
microwave energy. The oven further comprises supply means
supplying downwardly directed heated air, directed towards a part
of the article to be heated by the microwave energy (see Fig. 2 and
col. 5, line 40 to col. 6, line 12). There are jets spaced apart
such that returning cooler air separates the respective hot air
jets.The present invention provides apparatus having a
microwave oven cavity (1), said apparatus comprising:
at least one microwave means (3) for providing microwave energy
in said microwave oven cavity;at least one first supply means (21) for downwardly supplying in
said microwave oven cavity a column (A) of hot air, downwardly
directed to the region of an item (F) to be heated by said
microwave energy in said cavity; and wherein said apparatus is
characterised by: at least one second supply means (31) for
downwardly supplying in said cavity a downwardly directed hollow
column (B) of cool air relative to said downwardly directed
column of hot air; said at least one second supply means being sufficiently
surrounding and spaced apart from said at least one first supply
means such that said downwardly directed hollow column of cool
air will be circumjacent said downwardly directed column of hot
air so that said column of hot air is localised in said region by
means of said hollow column of downwardly directed cool air.Said apparatus of the present invention is not restricted
to cooking applications, e.g. said apparatus of the present
invention may be utilised in laboratory use.In said apparatus of the present invention, said at least
one microwave means may comprise at least one magnetron (3).
Said at least one first supply means may comprise at least one
nozzle means (21) for supplying said downwardly directed column of
hot air. Said
