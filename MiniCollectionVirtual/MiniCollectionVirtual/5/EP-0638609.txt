<ABSTRACT>
The relatively brittle starch esters are to be modified in such a way that they can be moulded at acceptable cost using known thermoplastic processing methods without adversely affecting the properties of the end products and the biodegradability. In addition, the products are to have good water resistance and should not decompose during thermoplastic processing. This is achieved by modifications comprising blends of starch esters with degrees of substitution of 
<
 3 and polyalkylene glycols having molecular weights of from 200 to 2000, optionally with addition of aliphatic saturated or unsaturated dicarboxylic acids and/or oxydicarboxylic acids and/or oxytricarboxylic acids and/or by replacement of from 20 to 80% of the polyalkylene glycol by polyhydroxybutyric acid having a molecular weight of from 1000 to 10,000 g/mol. Both amylose-rich speciality starches and conventional natural starches can be employed in the thermoplastically processible blends. The products allow a large variation latitude of processing properties and exhibit no significant drop in quality even after extended storage times.
