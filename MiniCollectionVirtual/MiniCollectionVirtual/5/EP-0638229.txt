<ABSTRACT>
A device for lifting articles that can be fitted to, 
and powered by, a tractor. The device comprises a 

frame (10) on which one or more spikes (24) are 
rotatably mounted for movement between a horizontal 

position and a vertical position. In order to lift 
and transport an article (30) such as a bale of 

silage the spike (24) in the horizontal position is 
driven nto the bale and the spike is then rotated to 

the vertical position.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a device for lifting 
articles and more particularly a device for lifting 
bales of grass, hay and the like for transport 
thereof. It is now a common practice to bind up hay, 
grass or the like into bales in the field and then 
transport the bales to a storage site such as a barn 
where they are protected from wet weather. In 
recent years there has been a trend towards the 
formation of very large bales. In order to move 
these bales a mechanical loading device is required, 
usually of the kind which can be fitted to and 
powered by a tractor. The loading device is used to 
lift the bales from the ground and load them onto a 
cart which is then towed to the storage site where 
the bales are unloaded, again using a mechanical 
loading device. For efficiency this kind of 
operation requires two high powered tractors, in 
addition to a large cart. It is not, therefore, 
particularly suited to the small farmer who usually 
has only one small tractor. The invention has been 
made with this problem in mind. According to the invention there is provided a  
 
device for lifting articles, comprising a frame 
adapted to be fitted to a vehicle, article holding 
means mounted on the frame to enable an article to be 
lifted by the device, the article holding means being 
rotatably mounted on the frame whereby an article 
held by said holding means can be moved between a 
position wherein the article rests on the ground or a 
support surface and a position wherein the article is 
supported by the frame. In a preferred embodiment of the invention 
article holdings means comprises a spike is mounted 
for rotation between a first position projecting 
generally horizontally from the frame and a second 
position extending substantially upwardly from the 
frame. In the first position the spike can be 
driven into an article such as a bale. Moving the 
spike to the second position lifts the article and 
rotates it through about 90Â° to the second position 
where the weight of the article is taken up by the 
frame rather than the spike. With the spike in the 
second position an article can be transported to the 
desired site where it can be lowered by rotating the 
spike to the first position again. For safety when 
travelling without an article the spike is preferably 
rotated back to the second position. Preferably the rotary movement of the article  
 
holding means is effected by hydraulic means which 
can be powered by the vehicle upon which the frame is 
mounted. The device of the invention

<CLAIMS>
A device for lifting articles cosmprising a 
frame adapted to be fitted to a vehicle, article 

holding means mounted on the frame to enable an 
article to be lifted by the device, the article 

holding means being rotatably mounted on the frame 
whereby an article held by said holding means can be 

moved between a position wherein the article rests on 
the ground or a support surface and a position 

wherein the article is supported by the frame.
