<ABSTRACT>
A novel method for the isolation of high molecular weight DNA from plants, yeast, bacteria, and animal cells or tissue employs xanthate forming compounds, such as sodium/potassium ethyl xanthogenate. The procedure does not require deproteination and yields clean DNA that is suitable for both PCR and Southern blotting. It can be utilized on a small scale without homogenizing the tissue. These features also facilitate automated screening of tissue samples, one of the labor-intensive techniques in molecular biology.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DNA ISOLATION METHODTechnical Field This invention relates to the isolation of DNA from whole plants and plant cells, tissues and parts, from yeasts and bacteria, and from animal cells and tissues.Background of the InventionWith the increasing need for DNA fingerprinting, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. Southern transfers, construction of genomic libraries and transformation experiments in biotechnology, the isolation of high molecular weight (HMW) DNA becomes a major problem. Several procedures for the isolation of HMW DNA have been reported, all of which have drawbacks for various reasons. The methods generally involve physical grinding of cells or tissue followed by extraction in buffers containing detergent, EDTA, Tris and other reagents. Some of the reagents used react with various cellular organelles; the function of others is unknown.The prior art methods are often"~time consuming, irreproducible and give variable yields of DNA, involving more art than science. The DNA obtained also varies in terms of its purity, and all of the methods involve purification of DNA with phenol, a protein denaturant which can be hazardous to users. Finally, a method that is effective in DNA extraction in one plant or animal group often fails when used on other plants or animals. 

 More recently, a solid phase extraction material comprising silica and having hydroxyl groups on its surface has been reported as a replacement for phenol for removal of proteins. However, the preparation of this material is cumbersome, and grinding of tissue is still needed.In view of these difficulties, a continuing need exists for a versatile method that would overcome these problems.It is an object of this invention to provide such a method.Disclosure of the Invention While not intending to be limited by theory, the isolation of DNA from plants, yeasts and bacteria is difficult partly due to the presence of a rigid cell wall which is rich in polysaccharides and therefore difficult to rupture completely with commonly used buffers. Removal of the cell wall by enzymes is tedious and not always feasible. Variations in DNA yield and quality from extraction to extraction using current methods probably arises from the varying degrees of cell wall break up. Thus, there has been a need for new technique for disrupting cell walls by a thorough, yet delimited mechanism to allow isolation of DNA in a reproducible manner without the need to homogenize cells or tissues.Polyhydric alcohols, including cellulose, have been
