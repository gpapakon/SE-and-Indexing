<ABSTRACT>
2,4-Polybenzoxazoles are synthesized from a 
biosynthetically prepared AB monomer. The 

biosynthetically produced precursor, 2,3-dihydro-3- 
hydroxyanthranilic acid (DHAA), is chemically transformed 

to the AB monomer, 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (HAA). This 
AB monomer is used to prepare said polybenzoxazoles.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the preparation of a 
novel set of homo- and copolymers containing the 2,4-polybenzoxazole 
unit prepared from the AB monomer 3-hydroxyanthranilic 
acid (HAA), which in turn is prepared 
from the biosynthetically produced 2,3-dihydro-3-hydroxyanthranilic 
acid (DHAA). Polybenzoxazoles may be formed by the 
condensation of a carboxylic acid (or its derivatives) with 
an o-aminophenol. The two sets of functional groups are 
referred to as A (indicating a carboxyl group affixed to a 
benzene ring) and B (indicating the amino and hydroxyl 
groups affixed to the same benzene ring), respectively. An 
AA monomer is a dicarboxylic acid, and BB and AB 
designations have corresponding meanings. Two examples 
of typical AB monomers are 3-amino-4-hydroxybenzoic acid 
and 4-amino-3-hydroxybenzoic acid. Polybenzoxazoles are well known rigid 
polymers, environmentally resistant, and possessing high 
modulus and high strength properties. They have found 
utility in the preparation of thermally stable transparent 
coatings for solar cells that inhibit ionizing radiation, and 
in molecular composite technology where they are used as 
reinforcements in blends with other common polymers. 
However, the lack of an inexpensive process for preparing  
 
the AB monomer precursors has been a handicap to their 
manufacture. U.S. Patent 4,847,350 describes a rapid process 
for the formation of heterocyclic aromatic polymers by 
contacting multifunctional aromatic compounds, such as a 
diaminobenzenediol, a terephthaloyl halide and/or an 
aminohydroxybenzoic acid, with a sulfonic acid and a 
dehydrating agent. These are two-step reactions and result 
in the 2,5-and 2,6-polybenzoxazoles. The AB monomer 3-amino-4-hydroxybenzoic acid 
is prepared from 4-hydroxybenzoic acid by nitration 
followed by reduction. The hydroxyl groups need not be 
protected. The AB monomer 3-nitro-4-hydroxybenzoic acid 
is reduced by aqueous stannous chloride in hydrochloric acid 
or by catalytic hydrogenation. Of these two possible 
aminohydroxybenzoic acids, the 3- amino-4-hydroxy isomer 
is more easily prepared because of ease of nitration. By contrast, 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (HAA), 
otherwise known as 2-amino-3-hydroxybenzoic acid, is a 
known compound that, so far as is known, has never been 
used in the preparation of polymers. HAA is a product of the 
transformation of the biosynthetically prepared DHAA and 
is the subject of this portion of the invention. Various chemical syntheses of 2-amino-3-hydroxybenzoic 
acid have
