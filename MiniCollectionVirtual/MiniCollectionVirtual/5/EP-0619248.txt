<ABSTRACT>
The device comprises a main conveyor (HF) and a feeding device (ES) for feeding articles (SG1, ..., SG5) onto the main conveyor (HF), the feeding-conveying direction (ESR) and the main conveying direction (HFR) forming an acute angle ( alpha ). The feeding device (ES) for its part comprises an acceleration zone (BS) for the acceleration of individual articles (SG1, ..., SG5) and a measuring device comprising a measuring barrier (MS), for determining the length of the articles (SG1, ..., SG5) to be fed. In further embodiments, the acceleration zone (BS) comprises a plurality of feeding belts (EB1, EB2) and a plurality of control barriers (LS1, ..., LS3) for increasing the feeding rate. The device can be used for feeding articles (SG1, ..., SG5) in a tilting-dish sorting installation.

Device, in particular for tipping-tray sorting
systems, comprising a main conveyor (HF) and a feeding

device (ES) to feed items of piece goods (SG1, ...,
SG5) on to the main conveyor (HF), whereby the feeding

conveying direction (esr) and the main conveying
direction (hfr) form an acute angle (Î±), the feeding

device (ES) comprises a supply belt (ZB), at least one
feeding belt (EB1; EB2) which forms an acceleration

path (bs) to accelerate the items of piece goods (SG1,
..., SG5) to be fed, and a measuring device with a

measuring barrier (MS), perpendicular to the main
conveying direction, to determine the length of the

items of piece goods (SG1, ..., SG5) to be fed,
characterized in that the measuring device comprises

only the measuring barrier (MS) perpendicular to the
main conveying direction (hfr), through which measuring

barrier in each case an item of piece goods (SG1, ...,
SG5) passes completely for its measurement.
Device according to claim 1, characterized in
that the approach of a free position or a free tipping

tray (SE) on the main conveyor (HF) can be ascertained,
the time for the acceleration of the relevant item of

piece goods (SG1, ..., SG5) can be calculated, the
feeding belt (EB1) can be selectively stopped at the

end of the length measurement and can be started again
at the calculated time.
Device according to claim 2, characterized in
that in the transfer area between the feeding device

(ES) and the main conveyor (HF) a belt conveyor (RF) or
a flat belt conveyor is provided.
Device according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the measuring barrier

(MS) is provided in the starting area of the
acceleration path (BS).
Device according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the items of piece goods

(SG1, ..., SG5) are made ready on the supply belt (ZB)
for transfer to the acceleration path (BS) and in that

at the end of the supply belt (ZB), at the end of the
first feeding belt (EB1) and in the transfer area in

each case a control barrier (LS1, ..., LS3) is
provided.
Device according to one of claims 3 to 5,
characterized in that at the main conveyor (HF) a clock

generator (TG) is provided, which emits a clock
frequency which is proportional to the conveying speed

(v
0
) of the main conveyor (HF) and which is used to
adjust the speed (v
1
) of the feeding belts (EB1, EB2)
and the belt conveyor (RF).
Device according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the measuring barrier

(MS) and/or the control barriers (LS1, ..., LS3) each
comprise a light barrier or suchlike.
Device according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the main conveyor (HF)

comprises tipping trays (SE) to accommodate the items
of piece goods (SG1, ..., SG5).
Method for use in a device according to claim
1, which device has a main conveyor (HF) and a feeding

device (ES) provided to feed items of piece goods (SG1,
..., SG5), which feeding device comprises a supply belt

(ZB), at least one feeding belt (EB1; EB2) which forms
an acceleration path (BS) to accelerate the items of

piece goods (SG1, ..., SG5) to be fed, and a measuring
device having a measuring barrier (MS) perpendicular to

the main conveying direction to determine the length of
the items of piece goods (SG1, ..., SG5) to be fed,

characterized in that the measuring device comprises
only the measuring barrier (MS) perpendicular to the

main conveying direction (hfr), through which measuring
barrier an item of piece goods (SG1, ..., SG5) passes 

completely for its measurement, in that the feeding
belt (EB1) is stopped at the end of the length

measurement, the approach of a free position or a free
tipping tray (SE) on the main conveyor (HF) is

ascertained, the time for the acceleration of the
relevant item of piece goods (SG1, ..., SG5) is

calculated and the feeding belt (EB1) is started again
at the calculated time.
