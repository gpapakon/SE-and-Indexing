<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a non-contact reader which 
comprises a reading device in order to read information 
from an information medium without mechanical or galvanic 
contact, in particular an identification means brought 
into proximity with the reading device, and in order to 
generate a meaningful signal at its output as a result of 
this reading, and which comprises a test device to test 
the correct operation of the reader. Such non-contact readers with corresponding 
identification means are known and are marketed in 
various embodiments. Such known readers comprise test devices which test the 
electronic circuit of the reader for correct operation by 
measuring and evaluating electrical parameters obtained 
by electrical contact with parts of the circuit. However, in this way it is never possible to demonstrate 
the correct operation of the wireless part of the reader 
with certainty. This is nevertheless essential for 
judging whether the reader works correctly or not, since 
the absence of the meaningful signal at the output of the 
reader is interpreted as the absence of an identification 
means within range of the reader. DE-A-R.132.973 describes a barcode reader in which the 
test device comprises means to vary the illumination 
strength of the sensor, for example by altering the light  
 
output of the light source, and to evaluate the output 
signals generated as a result. These means are operated 
manually by pressing a test button. The testing is 
carried out while reading a normal identification means 
introduced into the reader. With this known reader, 
testing is fairly complicated, while the test device is 
not simple in construction and demands special 
modification of the reader, making it expensive. US-A4.868.375 describes a barcode reader whose function 
can be modified by inserting an identification means with 
a special barcode. The modified function, for example a 
diagnosis function, is only started after such a special 
barcode has been read in. With this reader, testing is 
fairly complicated and laborious since a medium with a 
special barcode has to be made and inserted into the 
reader each time testing is carried out. The present invention has as its aim to avoid these 
disadvantages and to provide a non-contact reader in 
which testing is very simple and can be carried out 
quickly without requiring any complex modification of the 
reader. According to the invention, this aim is achieved by the 
reader having a test information medium, more 
particularly a test

Non-contact reader which comprises a reading device 
(1) in order to read information from an information 

medium without mechanical or galvanic contact, in 
particular an identification means (4) brought into 

proximity with the reading device (1), and in order to 
generate a meaningful signal at its output (U) as a 

result of this reading, and which comprises a test device 
(12) to test the correct operation of the reader, 

characterised in that it comprises a test information 
medium, in particular a test identification means (14) 

which is permanently mounted within range of the reading 
device (1) and which can be read in the same way as a 

normal information medium (4) readable by the reader. 
Non-contact reader according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the reading device (1) comprises a coil (2) with 

an electronic circuit (3) connected to it, while the test 
device (12) is formed by a test identification means (14) 

comprising a coil (15) and an electronic circuit (16). 
Non-contact reader according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the reading device (1) comprises an optical 

instrument (18) with an electronic circuit (19) connected 
to it, while the test device (12) is formed by a test 

information medium (14) with an optically readable 
pattern, in particular a test barcode (21). 
Non-contact reader according to any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the test device (12) comprises a 

switching system (9) with two states, namely a first 
 

state which permits reading of the test information 
medium by the reading device (1), and a second state in 

which this reading is prevented or impossible. 
Non-contact reader according to claim 4, characterised 
in that when the test information medium (14) is read, an 

interaction occurs between the latter and the reading 
device (1) and in that the switching system (9) can 

prevent the interaction between the reading device (1) 
and the test informati
on medium in that said switching 
system (9) comprises means for preventing the operation 

of the test information medium. 
Non-contact reader according to claims 2 and 5, 
characterised in that the test identification medium (14) 

comprises a coil (15) and an electronic circuit (16), and 
in that the means for preventing the operation of the 

test information medium comprises a switching element 
(10) which is shunted across the coil (15) and which 

short-circuits the coil (15) when it is closed. 
Non-contact reader according to claims 3 and 4, 
characterised in that the test identification means (14) 

comprises a test barcode (21), and in that the means for 
preventing the interaction between the test 

identification means (14) and the reading device (1) 
comprise a screen (22) which is transparent in one state 

and opaque in another state and which is mounted either 
between the test identification means (14) and the 

reading device (1), or which itself displays the test 
identification means in the opaque state. 
Non-contact reader according to any of claims 4 to 7, 
characterised in that the switching system (9) is 

 
controlled by the reading device (1). 
Non-contract reader according to any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the test information medium (14) is 

constructed and mounted with respect to the reading 
device (1) such that the presence of a normal information 

medium (4) in proximity with the reading device (1) is

Non-contact reader according to any of claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that the test information medium (14) 

comprises readable information about the corresponding
