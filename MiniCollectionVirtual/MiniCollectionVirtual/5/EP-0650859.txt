<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for 
estimating the temperature of a working oil in a shock 
absorber according to the preamble of claim 1. The invention further 
relates to an apparatus for controlling the damping characteristic 
of the shock absorber, which apparatus incorporates such oil 
temperature estimating device. More particularly, this 
invention is concerned with a technique for estimating the 
oil temperature in the shock absorber, without using a 
temperature sensor. The temperature of a working oil or fluid in a 
shock absorber used in a suspension system of a motor 
vehicle, for example, varies with the ambient temperature 
and the running condition or hysteresis of the vehicle, and 
the viscosity of the oil increases with a decrease in the 
oil temperature. To avoid various drawbacks caused by a 
change in the viscosity of the oil due to a change in the 
oil temperature, there has been a need to know the 
temperature of the oil in the shock absorber. An example of 
a technique to meet this need is disclosed in laid-open 
Publication No. 63-3536 of unexamined Japanese Utility Model  
 
Application, in which a temperature sensor is used to detect 
the oil temperature within a shock absorber. On the other hand, it is desired to obtain the oil 
temperature within the shock absorber without using a 
temperature sensor. There is also the following need in connection 
with a shock absorber. In a vehicle suspension system wherein the damping 
characteristic of each shock absorber can be controlled by 
means of an actuator, the following drawback would arise 
when the oil temperature in the shock absorber is relatively 
low, if the damping characteristic of the shock absorber is 
controlled irrespective of the oil temperature in the shock 
absorber. For example, the actuator may not operate as 
intended due to an increased resistance to a sliding 
movement of a movable member in the shock absorber when the 
viscosity of the oil is relatively high. In this case, the 
damping characteristic of the shock absorber cannot be 
normally controlled. Even if the actuator can be operated as 
intended, the damping force of the shock absorber may be 
excessively large due to the oil viscosity higher than 
required, leading to abnormal control of the damping force 
of the shock absorber. Where a stepping motor is used as the 
actuator for controlling the damping characteristic of the 
shock absorber, the motor may suffer from loss of 
synchronism due to an insufficient drive torque of the motor 
in
