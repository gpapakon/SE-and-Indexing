<ABSTRACT>
A filter medium (1) for surface filtration has a substrate web (2) comprising a yarn textile or a spun bonded fibrous web, and a fibre layer (3, 4, 5) which is formed from a coarse fibre layer (3, 4) and an external fine fibre layer (5) which are needle-punched together. According to the invention the fine fibre layer (5) essentially comprises microfibres.

<CLAIMS>
Filter means for surface filtration, with a web 
of carrier material, consisting of a thread structure or 

of a spun-bonded fabric, and with a fibre layer formed 
from a coarse-fibre layer (3, 4) and from an outer fine-fibre 

layer (5) which are interneedled, characterized in 
that the fine-fibre layer (5) consists essentially of 

microfibres which, in the case of inorganic fibres, have 
a fibre diameter smaller than or equal to 10 Âµm and, in 

the case of organic fibres, have a linear density smaller 
than or equal to 1 dtex, and in that the outside of the 

fine-fibre layer (5) is provided with a porous plastic 
coating. 
Filter means according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the fine-fibre layer (5) has a weight per unit 

area which amounts to at least 10% of the weight per unit 
area of the coarse-fibre layer (3, 4). 
Filter means according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the fine-fibre layer (5) has a weight per 

unit area which amounts to at most 33% of the weight per 
unit area of the coarse-fibre layer. 
Filter means according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that at least the fine-fibre layer (5) 

contains fibres which are electrically conductive and/or 
have a catalytic and/or absorbant effect. 
Filter means according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that at least the fine-fibre layer (5) 

contains metallic fibres. 
Filter means according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the fine-fibre layer (5) contains  

 
organic fibres or consists of these.
