<DESCRIPTION>
 BLOODBAG AND METHOD OF MAKING SAMEFIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to an improved container for the storage of blood (a bloodbag) and more particularly to a viricide-coated container which is capable of time-release of such viricide. This invention further relates to methods of making such a container and to novel viricides.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONTo date, the risk of infection by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) through transfusion of contaminated blood products has not been eliminated by serological screening of donors. Therefore, the need remains to minimize or eliminate the risk of infection with HIV of blood product recipients.An object of this invention is to provide a product which eliminates the risk of HIV infection of blood product recipients.Another object is to provide such a product which is reliable, economically efficient and simple to prepare.A further object is to provide new viricides which do not impair the red blood cell functions of stored blood.Other uses and advantages of this invention are described below. 

 2 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe above and related objects of the present invention are obtained in an improved viricide-coated container, such as a bloodbag, which is internally coated with a time-releasable viricide against HIV. The viricide-coated container is prepared by priming a conventional plastic substrate film of which the container walls have been or will be made so as to activate the film. Next, the film is coated with a hydrogel polymer. A viricide is absorbed into the hydrogel polymer either prior to coating the film with the hydrogel polymer or after coating the film with the hydrogel polymer and curing the film. Conventional viricides may be used. However, a preferred viricide is an alkylurea, a hydroxyurea, acetyl pyridium chloride or a combination thereof. Alkylureas and hydroxyureaÎµ have no adverse affects on the red blood cells contained in the blood.In a preferred embodiment of this invention, the substrate film is polyvinyl chloride film. The substrate film is primed using flame, oxidizing acid, corona discharge, plasma or coating with a primer. The coating primer may be a reactive resin, an oligomer or a salt solution of polyvalent ions. The viricide is preferably a urea derivative, such as a hydroxyurea or an alkylurea. Further, the viricide may be acetyl pyridium chloride. The hydrogel polymer is a copolymer of either hydroxyalkyl acrylates and methacrylates or acrylic and methacrylic acids. The hydrogel polymer may also be a
