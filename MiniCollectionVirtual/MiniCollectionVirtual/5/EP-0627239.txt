<ABSTRACT>
An implantable cardiac stimulator with an analog-to-digital 
converter which comprises timing means for 

defining measurement cycles. During successive cycles, 
the value of a cardiac waveform is sampled. The 

difference between sampled values in two different 
measurement cycles produces a value whose probability is 

predicted. A digital code is assigned to each expected 
difference value such that difference values with a high 

expected probability have a shorter code and values with 
a low probability have a longer code. Means are provided 

for assigning a digital code based on the determined 
difference, the digital code being of predetermined 

variable size, the size of the code being proportional to 
the predicted probability of occurrence of a particular 

difference. The variability in code length permits the 
resulting digital representation of the waveform to be 

compressed and the energy required for conversion to be 
reduced. Different codes can be assigned to a detected 

difference depending on the type of waveform (normal, 
tachycardia, fibrillation) which is being detected.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to implantable cardiac stimulators, 
including pacemakers and implantable defibrillators, which 
can detect electrical activity in the heart and which have 
the capacity to store representations of such electrical 
activity or transmit a representation to an external 
monitor or both. In particular, the invention relates to 
a data converter for converting a sensed analog waveform to 
a compressed digital representation. The heart pumps blood throughout the body in response to 
natural electrical stimuli which occur in the atrium and 
ventricle of the heart. If the natural electrical stimuli 
are disrupted or lost, the heart will not provide the 
circulation needed to sustain life. Implanted electrical 
devices which stimulate the heart have been used to correct 
various conditions. A pacemaker can be used to correct 
bradycardia, the condition wherein the heart beats too 
slowly. The heart may also beet too quickly (an arrhythmia 
or tachycardia) or it may quiver erratically 
(fibrillation). Electrical devices, including implantable 
defibrillators, have been designed to respond to such 
conditions and provide therapeutic electrical stimulation 
to the heart. In using these devices, it is frequently desirable for a 
physician to be able to study the waveforms being produced 
in the heart, either naturally or in response to 
stimulation. In general, the implanted device senses the 
electrical condition of the heart through one or more leads 
implanted in or near the heart tissue. The sensed 
phenomenon can be transmitted directly from the implanted 
device to an external monitor for study by a physician, or 
the waveforms may be stored in some fashion and transmitted 
later. In either situation, it has been recognized that 
storage or transmission of direct analog data is difficult 
at best, and impractical in many cases. Data is frequently 
better transmitted in digital form, particularly where the  
 
monitor may be remote from the patient as, for example, 
when the data is to be transmitted by telephone connection 
to a physician at a different location. The invention provides an analog-to-digital converter which 
is particularly adapted for use in an implantable cardiac 
stimulator. The convertor comprises timing means for 
defining measurement cycles. During successive cycles, the 
value of a cardiac waveform is sampled. It is found that 
because of baseline fluctuations and other variables, the 
expected magnitude or value of the cardiac waveform and the 
probability that a
