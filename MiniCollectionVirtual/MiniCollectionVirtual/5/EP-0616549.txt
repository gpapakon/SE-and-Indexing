Apparatus for the separation of particulate 
material from a flowing particle-containing liquid, in 

which a first dewatering device having a drum screen (2) 
and a second dewatering device are provided, the first 

dewatering device being formed by a housing designed as 
a drivable drum screen (2) and the second dewatering 

device having a drivable conveyor worm (3) which is 
arranged in a cylindrical housing (10) provided at least 

in some portions with perforations (5), characterized in 
that the first dewatering device is provided with an 

inlet (1) for the particle-containing liquid, so that the 
particle-containing liquid flows through the said housing 

of the first dewatering device in the longitudinal 
direction, the liquid being partially dewatered thereby, 

and in that at least that portion of the cylindrical 
housing (10) of the second dewatering device which is 

provided with perforations (5) is designed as a drivable 
drum screen (2'). 
Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the drum screen (2) of the first dewatering device 

is provided over its entire outer surface with 
perforations (5). 
Apparatus according to Claims 1 and 2, characterized 
in that a trough (11) designed with perforations (5) 

and reaching as far as the inlet region of the second 
device (3) is arranged between the first and the second 

device for the purpose of further dewatering. 
Apparatus according to Claim 1, 2 or 3, characterized 
in that the longitudinal axes of the first and  

 
the second device form with one another an angle which is 

preferably approximately 140°. 
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that spray nozzles (8) are arranged on 

the outsides of the drum screens (2, 2'), in each case 
along at least one, but preferably along a plurality of 

outer surface lines offset at 60° relative to one 
another.
