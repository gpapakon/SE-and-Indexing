<ABSTRACT>
A pivoting laryngoscope (1) having a power-driven curved spatula, used for performing intubation of patients under anesthesia or in resuscitation, comprising a handle part (2) and a spatula part (3), equipped with power means, power-feeding means and transmission means present in the handle part, which allow the spatula-part (3) to be movable in a radial direction with respect to a fulcrum (33) within a predetermined arc, in order to vary its curvature. The laryngoscope (1) is equipped with a guide (42) through which the operator inserts a cannula (40) for intubation in the patient's mouth, directing it to the desired point through the larynx and trachea, to the lungs, employing means for lighting the path of the cannula.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Pivoting laryngoscope having a power-driven curved spatula.-a5 The present invention concerns a surgical instrument, specifically a pivoting laryngoscope having a power-driven, curved spatula, used for performing intubation of patients under anesthesia or in resuscitation.As it is known, before performing10 surgery, it is necessary to anesthesize the patient. Anesthesia is obtained through drugs which work to completely suspend pain sensitivity in a temporary and reversible way; the anesthetic effect, generally obtained by using alcaloid drugs and nuscle relaxants, affects the brain, the cerebellum, the spinal cord15 and the peripheral nervous system in general , and is furthermore accompanied by a paralysis of the respiratory centers, variable only in intensity and duration exclusively through the use of different drugs.It is well known that prolongued20 paralysis of respiratory centers, causes brain damage and, in cases where the duration of the drugs' effect has extended itself beyond a given amount of time, death from asfyxia.In surgical practice, when the patient undergoes anesthesia, artificial respiration is given by means25 of external machinery specifically designed for this purpose, after having connected the patient to the same through cannulae and tubes. Connecting the patient to the machine requires a significant amount of manual maneuvers, generally executed by the anesthesiologist, which in medical practice are known as30 "intubation", consisting of the introduction of a tube or cannula through the mouth, the larynx and trachea to the lungs, the tube being then connected to the respiratory machinery. 

 In order to understand the problem, it must be taken into account that the above-described maneuver must be executed with means and within a time frame defined by the progressive paralyzing effect upon the respiratory centers generally brought about through alcaloid anesthetics and muscle relaxants or other similar drugs, therefore, the duration of the intubation process cannot extend itself beyond a generally brief and definite time frame, also because of the mechanical difficulties inherent to the introduction of the cannula of tube.Usually, in order to execute the intubation maneuver, the anesthesiologist uses a mechanical instrument, typically a spatula-tube mounted at a right angle on a handle, of the same type as that which is used to execute laryngoscopies, bronchioscopies or esophagoscopies. Said instrument having been introduced in the patient's mouth, the anesthesiologist

CLAIMS
1 - Pivoting laryngoscope having a power- driven curved spatula, particularly used for performing intubation in patients under anesthesia or in resuscitation, characterised by comprising:
- a handle for gripping (2) which houses the power means (5), power feeding means (4) and operating means (24) for the motorization, as well as motion transmitting organs (6) of said motorization to acurved spatula (3) therewith connected and of which it constitutes the performing extension.
- a curved spatula part (3), typically flattened, subdivided into a number of adjacent sections (30), (31), (32) the last of which (32) presenting a circular section at its terminal ending, said spatula part (3) receiving motion from transmission parts (6) present in the handle (2), allowing the spatula part (3) in itself to be moveable in a radial direction with respect to a fulcrum (33), said mobility defined within a predetermined arc. 2 - A pivoting laryngoscope having a power-driven curved spatula, according to claim 1, characterised in that the handle (2) is hollow, with a rectangular section and presenting a central portion (20) which permit its being held or gripped; having in kits inferior end a larger section portion (22) and in its superior end a symmetrical section portion (21) .
3 - A pivoting laryngoscope having a power-driven curved spatula, according to claim 1, characterised in that its power means (5) consist of a small electric motor of a known type, fed by a direct current by means of two rechargeable batteries (14) and (14A). 


 4 - A pivoting laryngoscope having a power-driven curved spatula, according to claims 1 and 2 characterised within the handle (2) there are present operating means (24) of the small motor (15) which allow the transmission parts (6) to transmit motion to the spatula-part (3) assembly.
5 - A pivoting laryngoscope having a power-driven curved spatula, according to claim 1 characterised in that the combined rotation of sections (11) (12), determines a progressive pivoting of the blade portions (30) (31) (32) as an ensemble, thereby obtaining a combined curvature, adjustable and reversible, which can be made to take on a range of positions comprised between A and B.
6 - A pivoting laryngoscope having a power-driven curved spatula, according to claims 1, 3 and 4, characterised in that the motor means are connected to an ending of a screw segment (15), having a projection (36) inside a tubular tang (8) stroking from C to Cl and setting in motion trasmission members.
7 - A pivoting laryngoscope having a power-driven curved spatula, according to claims 1, 3, 4, 6, characterised in that the motion transmitting means (6) acting between the power means (5) and the blade sections (31) (32) consist of an elbow plate (9) connected to a first shaft (19) which is in turn connected to a second extension shaft (29) in order that the assembly (5, 6, 9, 19, 29) imparts motion in the direction (34), by means of elements (11) and (12).
8 - A pivoting laryngoscope having a power-driven curved spatula, according to claims 1, 3, 4, 6, 7 characterised in that parts (10) (11) (12) are integral parts of the adjacent blade sections (30) (31) (32) and consist of two pairs of plates (42, 42A) and (43, 43A) having a semicircular
