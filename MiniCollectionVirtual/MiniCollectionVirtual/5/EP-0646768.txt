<ABSTRACT>
A first confocal optical microscope in which a good 
image with high contrast can be observed with which a 

bright image can be observed over a long time interval. 
The confocal optical microscope has a quarter 

wave plate arranged in an optical path between an 
imaging lens and an objective such that it is inclined 

relative to a reference optics axis extending between 
the imaging lens and the objective. Furthermore, the 

confocal optical microscope has a shortwave radiation 
attentuator for attenuating light radiated from the 

light source with wavelength of less than or equal to 
34o nm. The confocal optical microscope can form part 

of a length measuring device which can take a length 
measurement of a sample to be measured with high measurement 

accuracy and high reproducibility. The length 
measuring device also has a movable carrier, a carrier 

device for a sample to be measured, a computing device, 
a display device and a control device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a confocal optical microscope and 
length measuring device using this microscope. Conventionally a confocal optical microscope is used, applying 
its characteristic of a depth of focus which is extremely 
short, for viewing shapes such as cross-sectional 
shapes or the like, fine objects in biology, semiconductor 
technology or the like, and for purposes of various measurements 
in a suitable manner. In addition, conventionally, for example, for measuring the 
length of a line width of a resist pattern formed on a semiconductor 
wafer (width of a resist line) or a pattern distance 
(distance between adjacent resist lines) or for 
length measurement of a photomask pattern for exposure, a 
lengthmeasuring device is used which has an optical microscope. 
The semiconductor wafer is hereinafter called only a 
"wafer". Since a resist layer thickness according to a refinement of 
the pattern has recently tended to become smaller as well, 
there is a need for a length measuring device using a microscope 
with a shallow focal depth. With respect to the  
 
facts described above, a length measuring device using a 
confocal optical microscope has been developed which has 
the advantage that its focal depth is low to the greatest 
degree. Figure 6 schematically illustrates one important configuration 
of a conventional confocal optical microscope which is 
installed in a conventional length measuring device. In the 
representation, reference numeral 1 designates an illumination 
optics system, 2 a first polarizer consisting of a polarization 
plate, 3 a polarizing beam splitter, 4 an aperture 
plate with a pinhole, 5 a first objective, 6 an imaging 
lens, 7 a second objective, 8 a second polarizer consisting 
of an analyzer, 9 a second imaging lens, 10 a picture 
recording means consisting of a camera and the like, 
and 11 a quarter wave plate. In a confocal optical microscope with this type of configuration, 
radiation light from illumination optics system 1 
is converted by means of first polarizer 2 into a linear 
polarization. Subsequently, by means of polarizing beam 
splitter 3 it is reflected and locally irradiates one surface 
of aperture plate 4 which has the pinhole. An area 
which is locally irradiated in this process corresponds essentially 
to a field of view of the picture recording means 
10. The term "field of view of picture recording means 10" 
is defined as an area on the aperture plate in which the 
picture recording means can gather light. In the light for local
