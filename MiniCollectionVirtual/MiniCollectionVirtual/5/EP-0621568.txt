<ABSTRACT>
A coin handling machine includes a rotatable disk (1) for 
receiving deposited coins and feeding out the received coins 

to a coin sorting passage (4) by the centrifugal force produced 
by rotation thereof, the coin sorting passage having a pair 

of guide members (5,6) for passing only coins of a denomination to 
be handled therethrough, a denomination selector for selecting 

the denomination of coins to be handled and passage 
width adjusting cams for adjusting the spacing between the 

pair of guide members of the coin sorting passage in accordance 
with the denomination selected by the denomination 

selector, the passage width adjusting cams including first 
and second cams having different cam profiles, a motor for 

rotating the first cam and the second cam and a controller 
for controlling the motor, the controller being adapted for 

selectively transmitting a driving force of the motor to the 
first cam or the second cam, thereby adjusting the spacing 

of the pair of guide members of the coin sorting passage so 
as to coincide with coins of the denomination selected by 

the denomination selector. The thus constituted coin handling 
machine can accurately adjust the width of t
he coin 
sorting passage so as to coincide with various coins having 

diameters widely differing from each other with a mechanism 
of simple structure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a coin handling
machine such as a coin wrapping machine, a coin counting
machine or the like and, in particular, to a coin handling
machine including a rotatable disk for receiving deposited
coins and feeding out the received coins to a coin sorting
passage by the centrifugal force produced by rotation thereof,
the coin sorting passage having a pair of guide members
for passing only coins of the denomination to be handled
therethrough, denomination selecting means for selecting the
denomination of coins to be handled and passage width adjusting
means for adjusting the spacing between the pair of
guide members of the coin sorting passage in accordance with
the denomination selected by the denomination selecting
means.A coin handling machine such as a coin wrapping machine,
a coin counting machine or the like is generally
constituted so as to feed out deposited coins from a rotatable
disk into a coin sorting passage having a pair of guide
members and dropping coins of a smaller diameter than that
of the coins to be handled through a space between the pair
of guide members, thereby passing coins of only the denomination
to be handled therethrough and subjecting them to a
predetermined processing such as wrapping, counting or the
like.Therefore, in such a coin handling machine, it is 
necessary to adjust the spacing between the pair of guide members, namely, the width of
the coin sorting passage so as to coincide with the diameter of the coins to be handled
and for this purpose, a passage width adjusting means is provided for adjusting the width
wf the coin sorting passage using a cam.However, the diameters of coins currently in circulation in different countries differ greatly.
Therefore, for handling coins of all denominations current in countries throughout the
world, it is generally necessary to be able to handle coins of diameters between 15 mm
and 33 mm and to be able to adjust the width of the coin sorting passage accordingly. In
the case where the profile of the cam constituting the passage width adjusting means is
formed step by step for solving this problem, the fact that the pitch of the cam profile is
normally 0.1 mm means that the cam profile has to be divided into (55-15)/0.1 = 180 portions.
However, in this case, the central angle of each pitch is merely 2 degrees and, therefore,
it is extremely difficult to accurately form the cam profile.The European Patent Application EP-A-0357156 discloses the use of a cam wheel having
its perifery contured to provide any
