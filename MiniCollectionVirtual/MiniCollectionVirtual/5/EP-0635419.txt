<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a front bearing arrangement for a tiltable driver's cab of a lorry, with at least two bearing brackets (1) which are fastened to the vehicle frame and on which the driver's cab (28) is supported at the front via flexible bearings (31) which are arranged on mutually aligned bearing spindles (26) and are held in bearing shells (30) fastened to the driver's cab floor (28). According to the invention, the driver's cab is assigned a device for preventing compression during the tilting procedure in such a way that on the bearing shell (30), which holds a flexible bearing (31), a specially designed slider (35) is arranged in a fixed manner. The latter is of such a design and arrangement that when the driver's cab is not in its tilted position it does not prevent the compression thereof, but when the driver's cab is being tilted, the slider runs, from a certain tilting angle onwards, onto a ramp (36) provided at the end of the associated bearing bracket (1) and, on further tilting of the driver's cab, it then prevents the vertical compression thereof.

Front mount arrangement for a tilting cab of a truck, with at least two 
consoles (1) attached to the vehicle frame (29), at which consoles the cab 

(28) is supported at the front via elastic bearings (31) that are arranged on 
bearing shafts (26) aligned relative to each other and are supported in 

bearing shells (30) attached to the vehicle floor, characterised in that a 
device assigned to the cab (28) prevents the cab's spring compression 

during tilting operations, consists of a sliding element (35) having a curved 
outer contour (40, 41) and is attached in a fixed manner to a bearing shell 

(30) holding an elastic bearing (31), which sliding element (35) can be 
slewed together with the bearing shell (30) when the cab is being tilted and, 

from a certain tilting angle onwards, rolls with its curved outer contour (40, 
41) on to a ramp (36) provided on the front side of the associated bearing 

console (1) and, if the cab supported in such a way is tilted further, 
prevents the cab's vertical spring compression, but, if the cab is not t
ilted, is 
located away from said ramp (36) in a position in which it does not impede 

the cab's spring compression. 
Mount arrangement according to Claim 1, characterised in that the sliding 
element (35) is located on the outside of the central body (37) of the 

bearing shell (30) or on a reinforcement rib (38, 39) on the outside of said 
central body (37). 
Mount arrangement according to one of the foregoing Claims, characterised 
in that the sliding element (35) is made in a single piece with the bearing 

shell (30) and is particularly shaped so as to follow the contour of said 
bearing shell (30). 
Mount arrangement according to one of the Claims 1 and 2, characterised 
in that the sliding element (35) is attached as a prefabricated part to the 

outside of the bearing shell (30). 
Mount arrangement according to Claim 4, characterised in that the bearing 
shell (30) and the sliding element (35) are designed so that the latter can be 

clipped into place. 
Mount arrangement according to Claim 4, characterised in that the sliding 
element (35) is made of abrasion-resistant synthetic material.  

 
Mount arrangement according to one of the foregoing Claims, characterised 
in that the sliding element (35) consists of a metal basic body and an 

exchangeable add-on part having the sliding faces and made of abrasion-resistant 
synthetic material. 
Mount arrangement according to one of the foregoing Claims, characterised 
in that the sliding element (35), when viewed from the underside of the cab 

(28) in a vertical manner through the centre of the mounts, is arranged at 
the lowest point of the bearing shell (30). 
Mount arrangement according to one of the foregoing Claims, characterised 
in that the sliding element (35) has a banana-shaped curved outer contour 

with a relatively heavily curved rear contact face (40) and a less heavily 
curved support face (41) arranged before said rear contact face (40), which 

faces consecutively come into contact with the console-mounted ramp (36) 
during cab tilting operations. 
Mount arrangement according to Claim 1, characterised in that the ramp 
(36) is formed by the upper side of the obliquely and forwardly inclined 

roof (10) of a mount bow (2), which is designed as the base part of the 
mount console (1) and is a single-piece curved part and, at the lower end, 

has two mounting webs (5, 6) which can be screwed on, are preferably 
arranged in the same plane, are supported on the vehicle frame and have in 

between - as a deliberately deformable section - a raised area (7) with - 
when viewed from the side - an approximately U-shaped section with a 

front leg (8), a rear leg (9) and, at the top, the oblique roof (10), to whose 
outer sides are attached, particularly welded on, lateral elements (3, 4) with 

deliberately deformable areas, between which lateral elements (3, 4) a 
bearing shell (30) with an elastic bearing (31) located in said bearing shell 

(30) is axially fastened.
