<ABSTRACT>
They improve the passenger's passive safety and comfort. 
They are comprised of a deformable frame to absorb the energy 

transmitted in the presence of an impact, without any portion 
of the same becoming detached. The design thereof 

has no sharp angles or edges and in the back there are 
perfectly inserted accessories. The footrest is also hidden 

without projecting, having blunt forms. 
The frame has two crossbars (6) secured to the side 
feet (4.) The chassis or bed of the seat is formed by two 

triangular side plates (8, 9) braced by two cylindrical 
bars (13) passing through cross members (7) welded to the 

crossbars (6.) The back (3) is hinged to the top angular 
area of these plates (8, 9) and is adjustable as its frame 

(12) has an extension (17) connected to an adjustment mechanism 
(19) with an automatic instant blocking system. 
Optionally, the seat on the aisle is shiftable. 
The headrest is cushioned in the back since the rear 
frame remains lower. In this frame (38) a glass holder 

(46), an ashtray (43), a handle (45) and a hanger (44), 
and optionally a novel adjustable mirror, remain inlaid.

<DESCRIPTION>
The 
present specification refers to a seat structure 
for buses and the like, which provide some advantageous 
and relevant features with regard to presently used 
seat structures.  
 In broad outline, the seats that are presently used in 
buses and the like, though they provide functional features 
common to the seat in question, they nevertheless have certain 
deficiencies. EP-A-0 383 955 discloses a prior art seat 
structure for buses and the like, according to the preamble 
of claim 1 of the present application. Further prior art 
seat structures for public transport vehicles are known 
from EP-A-0 330 594 and EP-A-0 336 852.  
 As to the frame or chassis in which the normally two 
seats are supported and secured, the way and means with 
which this anchoring is done in some prior art structures, 
are not totally satisfactory 
because they are open and in a collision even at an average  
 
speed, they can previously come loose or after the chasis 
has been deformed, which implies a high risk for the passenger's safety. According to the invention, a seat structure is 
given which has the features as set forth in claim 1. Further features 
of the seat structure are given in the dependent claims. In the first place, as a novel and advantageous feature 
we can cite the fact that the frame or chassis in 
which the double seats are rigidly supported, is defined 
by two crossbars rigidly fastened to some side legs solid 
to the floor, carrying out the interconnection with the 
frames of the seats, upon the frames having some bars that 
pass through holes provided in the cross members welded 
to the crossbars of the frame, which prevents these parts 
from coming loose from the whole, as we have set forth above. This way of inserting the seats themselves in the 
frame makes it possible to also optionally, easily and 
safely achieve, at the factory, that the seat on the aisle 
side can shift a short distance away from the other seat. 
Thus when the passengers consider it to be convenient, 
they can separate their seats for their comfort. The frame of the back is provided with welded half 
shafts for rotation thereof in the holes provided in the 
side plates that are solid to the frame of the respective 
seat The frame of the back portion is materialized by a 
reverse U-shaped frame whose branches have deviations to 
obtain an ergonomic shape of the back. One of these 
branches of the frame has a descending extension for  
 
hinged connection to the mechanism that adjusts the inclination 
of the seat, this

<CLAIMS>
A seat structure for buses and the like, said seat 
structure comprising: 


at least two side feet (4), two seats (2), two back 
supports (3), and a frame (1) in which the seats (2) are 

mounted, whereby said frame (1) includes two parallel 
tubular crossbars (6) secured to said side feet (4); 
 
   characterized in that the frame (1) further comprises: 


at least two cross members (7) which are substantially 
orthogonal to said crossbars (6) and which are 

welded to said crossbars (6) such that they interconnect 
said crossbars (6), each of said cross members (7) being 

provided with a plurality of holes; 
at least two cylindrical bars (13) disposed substantially 
parallel with respect to said crossbars (6), said 

cylindrical bars (13) passing through respective ones of 
said holes in said cross members (7); 
four vertical side plates (8,9), each side plate 
(8,9) having a substantially triangular contour, two first 

ones of said side plates (8,9) being fixed to said crossbars 
(6), two second ones of said side plates (8,9) being 

fixed to said cylindrical bars (13) at points close to the 
bases 
of said side plates (8,9), each of said four side 
plates (8,9) having an upper vertex in the vicinity, of 

which there is a hole (10) for hinged connection of a frame 
(12) of the corresponding back support (3); 
 
   whereby
 
   the seat structure further includes armrests which 

are pivotably connected to corresponding ones of said side 
plates (8,9), the armrests being pivotable in a vertical 

plane; and
 
   the frame (12) of the back support (3) further 

includes a descending extension (17) provided with a end hole (18) 
for hinged connection  

 
to a mechanism (19) for adjusting the inclination of the 

back support (3). 
A seat structure according to claim 1, wherein the 
structure includes footrests (32), each footrest being 

pivotably hinged to supports (33) which are fixed to a rear 
one of said tubular crossbars (6), the footrest being 

pivotable to a collapsed position in which the footrest, 
aided by a spring, is situated upwards and remains housed 

in a rear recess (35) provided in the seat structure, in 
order not to be an obstacle for a passenger sitting in a 

seat behind. 
A seat structure according to any of the preceding 
claims, wherein the seat (2) situated between the two 

second ones of the side plates (8,9) is laterally displaceable 
by means of the cylindrical bars (13) being movable 

through the holes or bearings (15) of the cross members 
(7), said seat (2) being secured in its limit positions by 

means of a tension piece (16) hinged to an outer one (8) of 
the side plates of the seat and interconnectable with the 

cross member (7) which is closest to said tension piece 
(16). 
A seat structure according to any of the preceding 
claims, wherein the mechanism (19) for adjusting the 

inclination of the back support (3) comprises a threaded 
rod (20) having a first end which ends in a connection fork 

(21) hinged to the descending extension (17) of the frame 
(12) of the back support, said threaded rod (20) being 

inserted in a head (22) provided with a first hole (24) and 
a second hole (25) passing through said head and forming a 

small angle (α), the first hole (24) being smooth and with 
a diameter corresponding to the threaded rod (20), whereas 

the second hole (25) is threaded at an equal pitch as the  
 

rod (20) and has a diameter corresponding to the threaded 
rod (20), whereby the head can be turned to an angular 

position wherein the first hole (24) is aligned with the 
rod (20) such that the the threaded rod can vary the 

inclination of the back support (3), and the head can be 
turned to a position aligned with the rod (20) in which the 

second hole (25) is aligned with the rod (20) thereby 
producing a locking of the rod (20) by means of interlocking 

the threads of the second hole (25) and the threads of 
the rod (20), a coaxial spring (26) surrounding the rod 

(20) between the head (22) and the fork (21), this spring 
exerting a constant thrust against said head (22) by means 

of a guide bushing (27), the head (22) being provided with 
an exterior control means for tilting of the same, said 

control being linked to the frame of the seat structure; 
the head (22) having a flat surface (28) in correspondence 

with a front surface of said bushing (27), said flat 
surface being generally perpendicular to the geometric axis 

of the second hole (25), thereby assuring that the locking 
position is maintained automatically as long as the head 

(22) is not made to tilt in order to have the first hole 
(24) coincide with the rod (20); there being a pair of nuts 

at the ends of the threaded rod (20) in order to define 
adjustable stop means to limit the angular movement of the 

back support (3).
