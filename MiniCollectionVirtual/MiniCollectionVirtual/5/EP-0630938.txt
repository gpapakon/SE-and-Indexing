<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a flame-retardant resin
composition. In particular, the present invention concerns a
flame-retardant resin composition containing a polyphenylene
ether resin.It is conventional knowledge that organophosphorus compounds
such as triphenyl phosphate, cresyl phenyl phosphate, tricresyl
phosphate, and isopropyl phenyl phosphate can be blended into
polyphenylene ether resins (designated "PPEs" hereinafter) or
resin compositions containing this material and polystyrene resin
in order to impart flame-retardance thereto. However, such
resins have the drawback that the organophosphorus compound
exudes (bleeds) to the surface of the molded product during
molding.It is known that when an aromatic polyphosphate compound is
used as the phosphorus compound in order to overcome this
problem, the bleeding and the amount of gas emitted during
molding can be reduced from the levels occurring when the
aforementioned organophosphorus compounds are blended in
(Japanese Kokai Patent Application Nos. Sho 55[1980]-118957 and
Hei 1[1989]-17503). However, notwithstanding that the bleeding
on the surface of the molded product and the amount of gases
given off are reduced, these methods have the drawback that the
surface of the molded product loses uniformity and has discolored
portions.The objective of the present invention is to provide a
flame-retardant resin composition that makes it possible to
obtain a molded product whose surface is uniform, suffers no
discoloration, and does not bleed, and which does not give off
gas during molding.The inventors performed an investigation into the cause of
the aforementioned drawbacks of nonuniformity and discolored
portions experienced by the surface of the molded product. As a
result, they discovered that these drawbacks were due to the
magnesium present in the aromatic polyphosphate compound blended 
in to impart flame retardance, and found that said drawbacks
could be solved by keeping the magnesium content at 50 ppm by
weight or less. They thus arrived at the present invention.Specifically, the present invention is a resin composition
containing (A) 100 parts by weight polyphenylene ether resin or
sum of polyphenylene ether resin and vinyl aromatic hydrocarbon
resin, and (B) 0.1-40 parts by weight organophosphorus compound
including 50 ppm by weight or less magnesium as an impurity

where R1 through R5 are selected from among the group consisting
of C2-12 aliphatic hydrocarbon residues, C6-14 aryl groups, alkyl-substituted
aryl groups, aralkyl groups, and
