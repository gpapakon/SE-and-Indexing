<ABSTRACT>
Stable granular detergent compositions with good flow and 
dispensing properties are prepared using percarbonate bleach and 

selected sulfate salts. Thus, particles comprising builders and 
surfactants are prepared separately from percarbonate bleach particles 

of defined particle size. Water-soluble sulfate particles having a 
defined size range and no more than 40 ppm iron and no more than 5 

ppm copper are used in the compositions. The specified moisture 
content of the ingredients and overall compositions improves stability 

and flow/dispensing properties.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to granular detergent compositions
which contain a percarbonate bleach and which are formulated to
provide not only good detergency and bleaching performance, but also
improved storage stability and improved flowability and dispensing of
the granules.The formulation of modern granular laundry detergents without
the use of phosphate builders and under various constraints with
respect to fabric safety and environmental effects is a substantial
challenge. The formulator is faced with the need to provide detergent
compositions which remove a wide variety of soils and stains from a
wide variety of fabrics. Detergent compositions must function
effectively over a wide range of wash temperatures. They must be
storage-stable over a wide range of temperatures and humidities.
Granular detergents should desirably be free-flowing and easily
dispensed in automatic equipment. They must not suds too much nor
too little. To be affordable, they must be formulated using
economical, yet safe and effective, ingredients. Accordingly, there
continues to be a substantial investment in the search for new and
improved detergent compositions.Inorganic beaches such as percarbonate offer prospective
advantages to the detergent formulator due to their inherent cleaning
ability. Moreover, percarbonate bleaches offer prospective advantages
over the commonly-used perborate bleach, inasmuch as they do not
disadvantageously interact with important new surfactants such as the
polyhydroxy fatty acid amides. In addition, there is now some
indication that perborate bleach can sometimes undesirably complex
with, and stabilize, "polyol" stains, such as the polyphenolic materials
found in chocolate. Percarbonates do not suffer from this
disadvantage. Moreover, if properly formulated, especially as
disclosed herein, percarbonate can provide superior dispensing
properties as compared with perborate. Unfortunately, percarbonates 
are not as stable as perborates; hence, their formulation in granular
detergents can be problematic. The present invention addresses the problems associated with
the formulation of granular detergent compositions which contain percarbonate
bleach and provides means for overcoming such problems.
The present invention provides granular compositions with superior
dispensing properties, superior fabric cleansing performance at both
high and low washing temperatures (typically, 20°C to 90°C) and
equal storage stability, as compared with granular compositions
containing perborate
