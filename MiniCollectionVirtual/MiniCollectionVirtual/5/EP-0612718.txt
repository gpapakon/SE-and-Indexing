<ABSTRACT>
In a process for the preparation of N-alkylol amide monomers wherein a 
polymerizable amide is reacted with an aldehyde, the improvement which comprises 

adjusting the pH of the resulting N-alkylol amide monomer to pH 10-11 and adding 
thereto an alkali or alkali earth metal borohydride at a temperature of -10 to 

25°C so as to convert the residual free aldehyde in the equilibrium mixture to 
the corresponding alcohol.

<DESCRIPTION>
Latex binders are used in a wide variety of nonwoven and textile
applications. In nonwovens, they are used to bind together a loosely assembled
mass of fibers to form a self-sustaining web which can then be used to produce
disposable diapers1 consumer towels, disposable wipes, filtration products and
the like. In textiles, they are used, for example, in fiberfill, upholstery
backcoating, ticking coatings, flocking adhesives and high pile coatings.
Depending upon the specific end use, the binders are formulated with other
ingredients such as fillers, pigments, foaming agents, foam stabilizers,
catalysts, thickeners and the like.For many of these applications, it is desired to incorporate crosslinking
monomers into the latex which, after application to the substrate, will crosslink
in a weakly acidic pH range or in the presence of latent acid catalysts at
elevated temperatures in order to improve the durability of the textile or
nonwoven. Monomers derived from the reaction of a polymerizable amide with an
aldehyde are conventionally utilized for such purposes. Generally, these N-alkylol
amide containing monomers correspond to the structure:
 
where Y is

and where R1 is H or CH3; R2 is H or CH3; n is O to 3; R is H or CH3 or

where R3 is C1 to C4 alkyl or

and x is 2 to 4.Of these monomers, N-methylol functional ethylenically unsaturated monomers
are most often used. The N-(2,2-dialkoxy-1-hydroxy)ethyl acrylamide monomers are
also examples of frequently used monomers of this type.Although N-methylol acrylamide (NMA) is the most widely used crosslinking
monomer in such applications, it is also a recognized source of formaldehyde, a
chemical the presence of which manufacturers are seeking to eliminate or reduce.
Thus, NMA is generally prepared by the reaction of a 1:1 molar fixture of aqueous
acrylamide and formaldehyde under alkaline conditions (pH 9-10), a reaction
leading to an equilibrium mixture containing NMA, acrylamide and formaldehyde in
a ratio of approximately 96, 2.5 and 1.4%, respectively.Previous attempts to shift the equilibrium towards lower free formaldehyde
by increasing the pH of the reaction have led to undesirable side reactions such
as polymerization of the acrylamide monomer or destruction of formaldehyde via
the Cannizarro reaction. Another approach to lowering the free formaldehyde
level is disclosed in US-A-4,449,978 and involves using a molar excess of 
acrylamide in emulsion polymers prepared with NMA. Various scavengers have also
been suggested, such as are taught in
