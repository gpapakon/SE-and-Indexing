<ABSTRACT>
The subject invention is directed to a cartridge (14) for a writing instrument (10). In particular, the writing instrument includes a surface against which the cartridge abuts. The cartridge includes a tubular body for containing ink which has a front end including an applicator (15) for applying the ink, and a plug member (16) disposed at least partially in a rear end of the tubular body of the cartridge. The plug member includes a path (26) for permitting airflow into the tubular body, and a flange (34) for cushioning the cartridge against the abutment surface of the writing instrument so as to inhibit separation of the ink from the ink applicator and absorb pressure exerted upon the ink applicator during writing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to rectractable writing instruments, and more
particularly to replaceable ink cartridges therefor.Writing instruments utilizing replaceable ink cartridges, and in particular those
having ball point tips, are well known in the art to which the subject invention appertains. In
the past, it has been observed that ink contained within a cartridge may seep out of the ball
seat and leak from the cartridge tip to impede or prevent use of the writing instrument.
Those skilled in the art have determined that this problem may result from the accumulation
of excessive humidity within the cartridge body. Several mechanisms have been devised to
limit the accumulation of humidity within the ink cartridge of a ball point writing instrument
including those described for example, in U.S. Patent Nos. 2,877,744 to Ray, 3,282,254 to
Malm et al., 3,698,825 to Sears et al., and 4,565,463 to Otaguro et al. Each of these
patents describe vent plugs adapted to limit air flow to and from the interior of an ink
cartridge. In the '744 patent to Ray, for example, an end plug is provided for a ball point
pen which is formed with an elongated passage to permit the atmosphere to find access to the
inside of the pen. In the '254 patent to Malm et al., a plug is described which is formed
with a circular pathway for communicating the interior of the cartridge with ambient
atmosphere. Additionally, UK Pat. Appln. No. GB 2,260,946 discloses a writing instrument
in which a porous deformable support member is in constant pressing engagement with an
ink reservoir. Retractable writing instruments having a retractor mechanism for moving an ink
cartridge between a retracted position wherein the applicator tip is disposed within
the pen body and a protracted position wherein the applicator tip is disposed outside
the pen body are also well known in the art to which the subject invention appertains.
Examples of retractable writing instruments are described in U.S. Patent No.
3,113,558 to Marraffino, U. S. Patent No.3,326,189 to Baer and U.S. Patent No. 4,221,490 to Malm. These instruments
provide a plunger component disposed at the rear end of the pen for actuating the
retractor mechanism to move the cartridge. In this type of writing instrument, it has
been observed that a problem in the performance of the instrument may occur in that
ink may separate from the ball point tip of the cartridge when the plunger is impacted
by an undesirably large force, i.e. if dropped to the floor from a desktop. Generally,
