Process for preparing carbon-containing refractory 
ceramic moldings, in which a refractory matrix material and 

finely dispersed elementary carbon are homogeneously mixed, 
together with a non-aromatic organic polymer compound with a carbon 

residue (according to Conradson) of less than 0.5 wt.%, the 
mixture is subsequently processed into moldings, and the
 
moldings are subsequently heat- treated. 
Process for preparing carbon-containing refractory 
ceramic masses, in which a refractory matrix material is mixed 

homogeneously with finely dispersed elementary carbon, together 
with a non-aromatic polymer compound with a carbon residue 

(according to Conradson) of less than 0.5 wt.%. 
Process in accordance with claim 1 or 2, in which an 
aliphatic polymer compound is added as the non-aromatic organic 

polymer compound. 
Process in accordance with one of the claims 1 through 
3, in which the non-aromatic organic polymer compound is added 

as an aqueous solution (suspension).  
 
Process in accordance with one of the claims 1 through 
3, in which the non-aromatic organic polymer compound is added 

as a non-aqueous solution (suspension). 
Process in accordance with one of the claims 1 through 
5, in which the finely dispersed elementary carbon is added in 

the form of carbon black, graphite or coke. 
Process in accordance with one of the claims 1 through 
6, in which the finely dispersed elementary carbon is added as a 

particle fraction of less than 1.0 µm. 
Process in accordance with one of the claims 1 through 
7, in which the finely dispersed elementary carbon is added in 

an amount of 0.1 to 10.0 wt.% relative to the total mixture. 
Process in accordance with claim 8, in which the finely 
dispersed elementary carbon is added in an amount of 1.0 to 5.0 

wt.% relative to the total mixture. 
Process in accordance with one of the claims 1 through 
9, in which another carbon-containing component is added as a 

coarser particle fraction to the mixture besides the finely 
dispersed elementary carbon. 
Process in accordance with claim 10, in which the 
coarser carbon-containing component is added in such an amount 

that the total carbon content will be up to 30.0 wt.% relative 
to the total mixture. 
Process in accordance with one of the claims 1 through 
11, in which the non-aromatic organic polymer compound and the 

finely dispersed elementary carbon are added in the form of a 
premixed, aqueous or non-aqueous dispersion.  

 
Process in accordance with one of the claims 1 through 
12, in which an oxidic material is added as the refractory 

matrix material. 
Process in accordance with one of the claims 1 through 
13, using sintered magnesia, fused magnesia or magnesia-aluminate 

spinel as the refractory matrix material. 
Process in accordance with one of the claims 1 through 
14, in which the refractory matrix material is used as a 

particle fraction of less than 6 mm. 
Process in accordance with one of the claims 1 through 
15, in which the non-aromatic organic polymer compound is added 

in the form of polyacrylates, polycarboxylic acids, polyvinyls, 
polyvinylic acids, polyalcohols, methyl, ethyl, carboxymethyl-, 

and/or carboxyethyl celluloses. 
Process in accordance with one of the claims 1 through 
16, in which the non-aromatic organic polymer compound is added 

in an amount of 0.05 to 5.0 wt.% relative to the total mixture. 
Process in accordance with claim 17, in which the non-aromatic 
organic polymer compound is added in an amount of 0.1 

to 0.5 wt.% relative to the total mixture. 
Process in accordance with one of the claims 4 through 
18, in which a dispersing agent is added to the polymer solution 

in an amount of 0.1 to 2.0 wt.% relative to the polymer 
solution.  

 
Process in accordance with one of the claims 1 or 3 
through 16, in which the heat treatment is carried out in a 

temperature range of 130°C to 300°C. 
Process in accordance with one of the claims 2 through 
20, in which the mass is processed on site and is heat-treated 

and fired after the processing.
