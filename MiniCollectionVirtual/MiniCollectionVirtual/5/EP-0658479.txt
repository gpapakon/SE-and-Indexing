<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus (10) for feeding and tensioning a strap 
(12) in a power strapping machine comprises a strap feeding 

mechanism (30), a strap tensioning mechanism (40), and 
a pivoting roller carriage (50) pivoted by a feeding and 

tensioning cam (70). The pivoting roller carriage (50) is 
first pivoted in one direction to move feed rollers (32, 

34) together to engage a portion of a strap (12) and feed 
the strap (12) toward a strap application assembly where 

the strap is formed in a loop about an object or group of 
objects. The strap feeding and tensioning mechanism (10) 

actuates a first gripper (not shown) that secures an end of 
the strap in the strap application assembly. The pivoting 

roller carriage (50) then is pivoted to the opposite 
direction to move tension rollers (42, 44) together to 

engage a portion of the strap (12) and apply a tension to 
the looped strap. The strap feeding and tensioning 

apparatus (10) also actuates a second gripper (not shown) 
that secures the tensioned strap in a closed loop about the 

package so that the strap application assembly may form a 
strap joint sealing the strap in the closed loop. In the 

event that the strap (12) is not properly engaged by the 
first gripper, the strap will be fully retracted from the 

strap application assembly by the strap tensioning 
mechanism and the strap will be directed into a strap 

stretch-out housing (21) where it will remain until the 
strap feeding mechanism (30) again engages a portion of the 

strap (12) and re-feeds the strap toward the strap 
application assembly. The weight and position of the strap 

disposed in the strap stretch-out housing (21) prevents the 
strap from withdrawing entirely from the strap feeding 

mechanism (30) thereby ensuring that the strap feeding 
mechanism (30) will engage and re-feed the strap (12) to 

the strap application assembly automatically.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and
apparatus for feeding and tensioning a strap in a power
strapping machine. Specifically, the invention relates to
a strap feeding and tensioning apparatus that feeds a steel
or polymeric strap to a strap application assembly where
the strap is formed in a sealed tensioned loop about a
package. The invention also relates to a feeding and
tensioning apparatus that automatically re-feeds a strap to
a strap application assembly in the event that the strap is
not property fed to the strap application assembly in the
first instance.Strapping machines apply a steel or polymeric strap in
a sealed tensioned loop about a package to securely bind
the package for shipping, storage and merchandising.
Automatic strapping machines generally comprise an
automatic strap feeding mechanism that initially feeds a
strap to a strap application assembly comprising an annular
channel where the strap is formed in a loop which surrounds
a package to be bound. An automatic strap tensioning
mechanism then applies a tension to the strap so that the
strap application assembly may form a strap seal to
securely bind the package. Steel straps are typically
sealed with a metal clip and polymeric straps are typically
sealed by a weld formed with a heated blade or by friction.
It has been suggested to feed a strap to a strap
application assembly by frictionally engaging the strap
between a pair of counter rotating rollers rotated by a
motor driven shaft journaled to a frame. Likewise, it has
also been suggested to apply a tension to a strap by
frictionally engaging the strap between a pair of counter
rotating rollers that draw the strap in a tight loop about
the package. For example, U.S. Patent No. 3,232,217 to
Harmon et al discloses a strap feeding and tensioning
mechanism comprising two pair of counter rotating rollers
mounted on a bracket that may be positioned to frictionally 
engage a strap for feeding or tensioning the strap in a
strap application assembly. Automatic strapping machines
frequently encounter problems feeding the strap to the
strap application assembly. For instance, the strap may
not properly feed along the annular channel or the strap
may not be securely retained by the strap application
assembly during tensioning of the strap. A strap not
properly fed to the strap application assembly or a strap
not securely retained by the strap application assembly
during tensioning of the strap must be retracted from the
strap application assembly and then re-fed by the strap
feeding
