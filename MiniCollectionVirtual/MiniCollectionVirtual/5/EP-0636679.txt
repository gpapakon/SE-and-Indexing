1. Fuel, characterized in that it mainly consists of what 
is called shredder waste from which the inert materials 

which are originally present in it, at any rate at least 
a number of the fine inert materials (3), as well as 

chlorous materials, at any rate at least the highly 
chlorous materials (4), have been mostly eliminated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a fuel. Particularly, the invention concerns a fuel which is 
suited as a fuel for industrial furnaces. In particular, it concerns a fuel which is eligible to be 
combusted in carbonizing furnaces. An aim of the invention hereby consists in that such 
furnace fuel can be produced from waste. Another aim of the invention consist in offering a fuel 
from waste with sufficient efficiency of combustion, a 
low ash content after the combustion and a low chlorine 
emission during the combustion so as to be used in 
furnaces in an ecologically sound manner. To this aim the invention concerns a fuel, characterized 
in that it mainly consists of what is called shredder 
waste from which the inert materials which are originally 
present in it, at any rate at least a number of the fine 
inert materials, as well as chlorous materials, at any 
rate at least the highly chlorous materials, have been 
mostly eliminated. Shredder waste is, as is known, waste which is produced 
during the processing of scrap in what is called a 
shredder or hammer mill.  In order to better explain the characteristics of the 
invention, the following example is given without being 
limitative in any way, describing how the fuel is 
obtained according to the invention, is composed 
respectively, with reference to the only accompanying 
schematic drawing. As shown in the accompanying figure, the fuel 1 according 
to the invention consists of what is called shredder 
waste 2 from which the inert materials 3 which are 
originally present in it, at any rate at least a number 
of the fine inert materials, as well as chlorous 
materials 4, at any rate at least the highly chlorous 
materials, have been mostly eliminated. By eliminating the fine inert materials, the efficiency 
of combustion of the waste is considerably increased and 
the ash content is considerably decreased. By the above-mentioned 
inert materials is mainly understood stone, 
glass and earth. Preferably, the fuel consists of a sieved product, as by 
sifting in a sieve installation 5, such as a drum screen 
or the like, the above-mentioned inert materials can be 
optimally eliminated. Further, the fuel 1 is preferably also a product which is 
derived from shredder waste 2 and which is mainly free 
from the highly chlorous materials 4. These highly 
chlorous materials can hereby be separated in an 
installation 6 which provides for one or several 
treatments from the following series: dynamic flotation 
in what is called a whirl bath with water or

Fuel according to claim 1, characterized in that it is 
mainly free of fine inert materials (3) which consist of 

stone, glass and earth. 
Fuel according to claim 2, characterized in that the 
above-mentioned inert materials (3) are removed from it 

by means of sifting. 
Fuel according to any of the above claims, 
characterized in that, in order to separate the highly 

chlorous materials, it underwent a treatment from the 
following series: dynamic flotation in what is called a 

whirl bath with water or another fluid, static flotation 
in a medium which has the density of the required 

separation threshold, or aerodynamic separation by means 
of an exhaust system.
