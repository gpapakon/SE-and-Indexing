<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to
cutting elements for use with rotary drag bits, and more
specifically to superhard cutting elements having an
extremely smooth finish on at least a portion of the leading
surface or cutting face.Superhard cutting elements have been commercially
available for over two decades. The typical superhard
cutting element employed on rotary drag bits for earth
boring comprises a substantially planar polycrystalline
diamond compact (PDC) table supported by a metal substrate,
typically of sintered tungsten carbide, although other
metals and combinations of metals have been employed over
the years. The cutting face on the vast majority of
commercially available PDC cutting elements is a planar,
circular surface. In state of the art PDC cutting elements,
the cutting face is typically lapped to a smooth finish.In some subterranean formations, PDC cutting
elements have been very effective in cutting the formation
as the drag bit carrying the cutting elements rotates and
the edge of the cutting surface engages the formation.
However, in certain formations which fail plastically, such
as highly pressured or deep shales, mudstones, siltstone and
some limestones, as well as other ductile formations, the
formation cutting have a marked tendency to adhere to the
leading surface or cutting face of the cutting element.When cuttings adhere to the cutting face of a
cutting element, they tend to collect and to build up as a
mass of cuttings adjacent to the point or line of engagement
between the cutting face of the PDC cutting element and the
formation, potentially increasing the net effective stress
of the formation being cut. This build up of cuttings moves
the cutting action away from and ahead of the edge of the
PDC cutting element and alters the failure mechanism and 
location of the cutting phenomenon so that cutting of the
formation is actually effected by this built up mass, which
obviously is quite dull. Thus, the efficiency of the drag
bit is drastically reduced.Undesired adhesion of cuttings from subterranean
formations being drilled by drag bit PDC cutting elements
has long been recognized as a problem in the subterranean
drilling art. A number of different approaches have been
attempted to facilitate removal of formation cuttings from
the cutting face of PDC cutting elements. For example, U.S.
Patent No. 4 606 418 to Thompson discloses cutting elements
having an aperture in the center thereof which feeds
drilling fluid from the interior of the drill bit onto the
cutting
