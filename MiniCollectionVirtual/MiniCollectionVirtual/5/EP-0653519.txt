<ABSTRACT>
Device for controlling an actuator of construction equipment prevents 
voiding of a target actuator, by controlling inertia load and power load and 

reducing heat generated in its return oil channel by means of controlling the 
aperture of the return oil channel. The device includes directional control 

valve 14a for controlling a target cylinder 15a of construction equipment. 
The directional control valve is switched and controlled by a pilot valve 19a 

which is provided with an operating lever. A meter-out circuit is provided 
between target actuator 15a and a tank line 16, the meter-out circuit being 

separated from a meter-in circuit which is connected to control valve 14a. 
A meter-out valve 32 provided in the meter-out has a throttle position and a 

large aperture position, the throttle position being adjusted by external signals 
Pi, corresponding to strokes of the respective operating levers. External 

signals Pi, for controlling the aperture of meter-out valve 32, are restricted so 
as not to exceed limiter pressure which is determined by function between the 

rotation speed of engine 11 which drives the source of hydraulic pressure and 
degree of operation of operating levers of other actuators.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to control devices
for actuators. More particularly, the present invention
relates to a control device for an actuator of construction
equipment.In conventional circuits used to control, for
example, hydraulic cylinders, providing for stable and
continuous operation has proven highly problematic. This
difficulty is heightened by the constraints involved in
high-speed engine operation. Attempts have been made to
solve these problems using known circuits.Turning now to Figure 5, an example of one of such
conventional circuits is shown. An oil feed channel 13 is
connected to a discharge port of main pump 12 which is
driven by an engine 11. The engine 11 is provided with a
plurality of directional control valves 14a, 14b, and 14c.Working fluid is supplied to actuators 15a, 15b
and 15c through the oil feed channel 13. The direction of
flow of the fluid is controlled by respective spools of
control valves 14a, 14b and 14c. Working fluid discharged
from the actuators 15b and 15c returns to a tank line 16,
through an oil return channel and control valves 14a, 14b
and 14c.Actuator 15a, a hydraulic cylinder, is the target
cylinder to be controlled. Spool valve 14a controls target 
cylinder 15a. A plurality of pilot valves 19a, 19b, and 19c
are attached to a pilot pressure feed oil channel 18.Oil channel 18 is connected to a discharge port of
a pilot pump 17 driven by engine 11, in the same manner as
main pump 12.Each pilot valve 19a, 19b, and 19c is provided
with an operating lever. The opening levers associated with
each respective pilot valve 19a, 19b and 19c are controlled
by an operator of the construction equipment.Pilot lines a1/a2, b1/b2, and c1/c2 are connected
to the respective pilot valves 19a, 19b, and 19c. Pilot
lines a1/a2, b1/b2 and c1/c2 are connected to pilot pressure
receiving sections of the spools of the corresponding
control valves.In operation, the operating lever of pilot valve
19a is biased in the direction of a1, so that cylinder spool
14a, is shifted through pilot line a1 from the neutral
position (as shown in the drawing). This movement of pilot
valve 19a, to the working position (the lower oil channel)
causes working fluid to be fed from a meter-in oil channel
21, through an oil feed channel 22 to the head end of target
cylinder 15a.At the same time, as a result of the extension of
target cylinder 15a, oil is returned through an oil return
channel 23, to cylinder spool 14a, and discharged to tank
line 16. The oil is returned through an oil return channel
