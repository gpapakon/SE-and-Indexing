<DESCRIPTION>
This invention lies in the broad field of burial practices.
More particularly, the invention relates to a receptacle for
containing ashes at crematoria.Although the present invention will be described herein in
connection with burial practices, it will be appreciated
that the invention may find many different applications.At present, ashes of deceased persons may be stored in wall
compartments at crematoria. This is a commonly accepted but
relatively expensive practice. An alternative offered is to
place ashes in a garden at crematoria, with a plaque
displaying the name and other details of the deceased
person. However, this practice does not allow ashes to be
contained in any type of a receptacle. Ashes are placed in a
direct manner into the soil of the garden. In many cases,
relatives and friends of the deceased person recoil at the
idea that ashes will not be contained within the garden in
such a way as to preserve the integrity of ashes.In addition, the plaques themselves are usually mounted on
a concrete base. These tend to sustain damage during
gardening operations needed to maintain an attractive
appearance of the garden. Periodically, the plaques must be 
moved in order to facilitate gardening operations. The concrete bases often
fracture causing the plaques to appear dilapidated. The fractures may also result
in difficulties in maintaining the bases in an upright position.There is also a need for a receptacle to contain ashes of pets or other animals
whose remains are desired to be preserved for sentimental reasons. At present
no eminently suitable receptacle exists.There is disclosed in German Patent Specification No. 2626187 a hollow
chamber tombstone which is capable of lying flat on the grave or as being
mounted as a vertical column. This prior art disclosure deals with the construction
of hollow tombstones from a thin walled material, such as plastic or metal, to
reduce costs and weight of traditional tombstones and memorial slabs. The
disclosure contemplates the in situ filling of the hollow tombstone with a filler
material such as sand for additional weighting down. The sand or other filler
material (which could be a cement or concrete mix) is needed to stabilise the
tombstone. It follows that the filler material needs to have sufficient weight for this
stabilisation. The substitution of cremated remains would not provide the degree
of stabilisation required. Cremated remains generally weigh approximately 1kg to
2kg and this would be quite insufficient to weigh down the tombstone
