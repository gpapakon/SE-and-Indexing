<DESCRIPTION>
Ethylenediaminetriacetic acid (ED3A) or its salts (such as ED3ANa3) has
applications in the field of chelating chemistry, and may be used as a starting material
in the preparation of strong chelating polymers, oil soluble chelants, surfactants and
others. Conventional routes for the synthesis of ethylenediaminetriacetic acid were
achieved via its N-benzyl derivative, which was subsequently hydrolyzed in alkaline
solutions to ED3ANa3, thus avoiding cyclization to its 2-oxo-1,4-piperazinediacetic
acid (3KP) derivative. Syntheses attempted by both the alkaline condensation of
chloroacetic acid with ethylenediamine, and the carboxymethylation of the diamine
with formaldehyde and sodium cyanide resulted in complex mixtures requiring
complex extraction techniques (e.g. almost exclusive solubility of 3KP in boiling
dimethylformamide, Can. J. Chemistry 1970, 48(1), 163-175) to generate the desired
product, and then in only relatively poor yield. In addition, conventional processes
resulted in large quantities of by-product, such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
(ED4A). Where the by-products were especially objectionable, complicated blocking
techniques were necessary in order to achieve a relatively pure solution.One example of the synthesis of ethylenediamine-N,N,N'-triacetic acid is shown
in Chemical Abstracts 78, Vol. 71, page 451, no. 18369c, 1969. There it is
disclosed that ethylenediamine reacts with ClH2CCO2H in a 1:3 molar ratio in basic
solution at 10°C for 24 hours to form a mixture from which ethylenediamine-N,N,N'-triacetic
acid can be separated by complexing the same with Co(lll). The resulting 
cobalt complexes can be isolated through ion exchange.These conventional processes do not produce ED3A with sufficient purity or in
sufficient quantity to make the preparation of N-acyl derivatives of ED3A economically
attractive. Such derivatives are desirable from the technical standpoint in view of
their utility as surfactants, corrosion inhibitors, lubricant enhancers, enzyme inhibitors,
metal precipitation additives, chelants, emulsifiers, etc.EP-A-516,867, published after the priority date of the present
application discloses a simple process for the synthesis of
ED3A or its salts in high yield. Specifically, a salt of N,N'-ethylenediaminediacetic
acid (ED2AH2) is condensed with stoichiometric amounts, preferably slight molar
excesses of, formaldehyde, at temperature between 0° and 110°C, preferably 0° to
65°C and pH's greater than 7.0 to form a stable 5-membered ring intermediate. The

substituents chosen from halogen, hydroxy, a carboxylic acid
group, or an -N,N',N'-ethylenediaminetriacetic acid group;

which process comprises:

ethylenediaminediacetic acid comprising a basic cation;
(b) reacting the product of step a with a cyanide
source;
(c) cyclising the monoamide-diacid product of step

step (b) the ethylenediaminediacetic acid salt is an alkali

metal or alkaline earth metal salt, and in step (d) the
base is an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal hydroxide.
