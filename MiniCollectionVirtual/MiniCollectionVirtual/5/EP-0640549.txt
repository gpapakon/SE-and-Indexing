<ABSTRACT>
A folding device for the zigzag folding of a sheet, comprising two pairs of folding 
rollers (13, 14; 16, 17) which form folding nips (12, 15) and which are drivable alternately 

in opposite directions of rotation, and feed rollers (4, 5) which alternately feed a sheet for 
folding to the folding nips (12, 15).

 
The speed of conveyance of the folding rollers (13, 14; 16, 17) is initially 120% of the 

speed of conveyance of the feed rollers and after passage of the leading sheet edge 
through the first folding nip (12) it is 110% of said speed of conveyance. After each 

reversal of the direction of rotation of the folding rollers (13, 14; 16, 17) the speed of 
conveyance of the folding rollers is initially 110% of the speed of conveyance of the feed 

rollers (4, 5) and shortly after passage of a fold made in the associated folding nip (15, 
12) it is 100% thereof.

 
For realising a desired folding length the set process time between the start of a folding 

cycle and the change of the direction of drive of the folding rollers (13, 14; 16, 17) is 
automatically adjusted in dependency of this folding length (V) and the total sheet length 

(L).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a folding device for the zigzag folding of a sheet, comprising
folding rollers which form two parallel folding nips and are each drivable alternately in
opposite directions of rotation, said folding nips being situated at some distance from
one another in a folding path, and a feed means for feeding a sheet to be folded in the
folding path between the folding nips and deflecting means for alternately deflecting a
supplied sheet part to the folding nips, the speed of conveyance of the folding rollers
being greater than or equal to the speed of conveyance of the feed means.
A folding device of this kind is known from European patent EP-B 0 156 326. In the
folding device described therein, the speed of conveyance of the folding rollers during
folding is always greater than the speed of conveyance of the feed means. Only when
the leading edge of a sheet for folding arrives in a folding nip for the first time is the
speed of conveyance of the folding rollers reduced for a short time to the speed of
conveyance of the feed means.
The faster-conveying folding rollers serve to tauten a sheet which has to be folded in the
bends that the sheet must traverse between the feed means and the folding nips to
ensure that the sheet is folded exactly at predetermined places.
One disadvantage of this known folding device is that slip can easily occur between
superposed parts of the sheet fed through a folding nip, because the coefficient of
friction between sheet surfaces is generally lower than that between a nip-forming
surface and a sheet surface. One consequence of such slip is that sheet parts
interconnected by a fold shift relatively to one another and, on the subsequent return,
pass through the folding nip in the shifted state with the formation of an unwanted
second fold in addition to a previous formed fold.The object of the invention is to provide a folding device without this disadvantage.
To this end, in a folding device of the type referred to in the preamble, according to the
invention, control means are provided which, shortly after a sheet has been folded in a
folding nip, change the folding rollers over from a first speed of conveyance greater than
the speed of conveyance of the feed means, to a second speed of conveyance equal to
the speed of conveyance of the feed means and maintain said second speed of
conveyance until the next change of the direction of drive of the folding rollers
Consequently, no incorrect folds are formed in the sense of double folds on a fold line

A folding device for the zigzag folding of a sheet, comprising folding rollers (13,
14; 16, 17) which form two parallel folding nips (12, 15) and are each drivable alternately

in opposite directions of rotation, said folding nips (12, 15) being situated at some
distance from one another in a folding path (18), and a feed means (4, 5) for feeding a

sheet for folding in the folding path (18) between the folding nips (12, 15) and deflecting
means (7, 10) for alternately deflecting a supplied sheet part to the folding nips (12, 15),

the speed of conveyance of the folding rollers (13, 14; 16, 17) being greater than or equal
to the speed of conveyance of the feed means (4, 5), characterised in that control means

(24) are provided which, shortly after a sheet has been folded in afolding nip (15, 12),
change the folding rollers (13, 14; 16, 17) over from a first speed of conveyance greater

than the speed of conveyance of the feed means (4, 5), to a second speed of conveyance
equal to the speed of conveyance of the feed means (4, 5) and maintain said second

speed of conveyance until the next change of the direction of drive of the folding rollers
(13, 14; 16, 17).
A folding device according to claim 1, characterised in that the control means (24)
set the folding rollers (13, 14; 16, 17) at the start of the folding cycle to a third speed of

conveyance greater than the first speed of conveyance, change over this set speed of
conveyance, shortly after the leading edge has for the first time been taken through a

folding nip (12), to a fourth speed of conveyance less than thethird but greater than the
second speed of conveyance and maintain this fourth speed of conveyance until the

next change of the direction of drive of the folding rollers (13, 14; 16, 17).
A folding device according to claim 2, characterised in that the fourth speed of
conveyance is equal to the first speed of conveyance.
A folding device according to any one of the preceding claims, characterised in
that folding nips (12, 15) are formed by rollers (13, 14; 16, 17) directly coupled to a drive.
A folding device according to claim 4, characterised in that the drive of the rollers
(13, 14; 16, 17) forming a folding nip comprises an endless elastic drive belt (31; 32) so

trained around guide rollers (33; 34) coupled to the folding rollers (13, 14; 16, 17) that
said folding rollers are drivable at the same circumferential speed in opposite directions

of rotation.
A folding device according to claim 2 or 3, characterized in that the control means
(24) comprise adjusting means to automatically adjust the set process time between the

start of a folding cycle and a change of the direction of drive of the folding rollers (13, 14;
