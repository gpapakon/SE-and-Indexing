<ABSTRACT>
In order to discriminate automatically scanning modes of recorded 
signals in a video recording/reproducing apparatus such as a video tape 

recorder, horizontal synchronizing signals output from a video 
demodulating circuit 5 are supplied to a period measuring portion 6 to 

measure their period. An output from the period measuring portion 6 is 
supplied to a comparing portion 7 including comparators 7a and 7b. The 

comparator 7a is supplied with a first reference signal from a terminal 
8, and the comparator 7b with a second reference signal from a terminal 

9, such that the output from the period measuring portion 6 is compared 
with the reference signals in the comparators 7a and 7b, respectively. 

Based on a result of the comparison, the comparing portion 7 sends a 
switching signal to a servo control circuit 10.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to automatic discrimination between one 
scanning mode and another by which video signals were recorded on a 
recording medium, such as a tape, with a video recorder/reproducer, 
such as a video tape recorder. As well known, various modes of scanning video signals are 
employed worldwide. Apart from the scanning modes, there are also 
various modes for modulating luminance signals and color-difference 
signals. In view of this, some video tape recorders (hereinafter 
called VTRs) or other video signal recorders/reproducers are designed 
to cope with some different broadcasting modes. In order to reproduce video signals recorded in different areas 
using different broadcasting modes, such a video signal 
recorder/reproducer includes a plurality of signal processing circuits 
in accordance with respective recording formats such that one of the 
circuits is selectively activated to reproduce a particular signal in 
accordance with the format used in recording the particular signal. 
Typically, users can select one of the signal processing circuits by 
manipulation of a changeover switch. Differences in scanning mode are 
greatly related to track patterns on recording media, and inconsistency 
in scanning mode makes it impossible to even obtain reproduced signals 
from a recording medium. Discrimination of scanning modes is therefore 
considered difficult. In this respect, a method for automatically discriminating 
scanning modes has been put in practical use. The method discriminates 
scanning modes by counting the number of horizontal synchronizing 
signals contained in a field. The method may enable discrimination of scanning modes with a 
sufficient preciseness during a normal reproducing operation. However, 
during a reproducing operation at a different speed, such as "cue" or 
"review", noise bars appear on the screen and disturb precise 
discrimination. If an error occurs in discrimination, a large noise 
enters in the reproduced signal. That is, this method is weak at 
noises, and it is liable to cause errors in determination. Japanese patent application JP-A-57011586 describes a video 
signal reproducing apparatus that includes a rotatable drum for 
reproducing recorded video signals from a video tape and a motor for 
rotating the rotatable drum. Means are provided for measuring  
 
the frequency of the horizontal synchronising signals included in the recorded signals. 
Also, discriminating means are provided to determine whether a detected 
horizontal scanning frequency is
