<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
manufacturing a semiconductor device. For high integration of semiconductor elements, 
techniques of miniaturizing elements and isolating 
elements in fine regions have become important. 
According to the recent technique, a field oxide film is 
formed in an element isolation region and impurities of 
the same conductivity type as of a well are implanted as 
a punch-through stopper. It is necessary to set the 
impurity concentration to have a peak at the position 
just under the field oxide film in the depth direction. 
Field ions are implanted to have such an impurity 
concentration distribution after the field oxide film was 
formed. It is therefore possible to prevent impurities 
from being diffused by a thermal process for forming the 
field oxide film, and to improve the controllability of 
impurity concentration distribution. An element 
isolation method relevant to the present invention will 
be described with reference to Fig. 2. As shown in Fig. 2(a), boron ions (B⁺) or the like 
are implanted on the surface of a semiconductor substrate 
101 at a predetermined impurity concentration to form a 
p-type well 115. A thermal oxide film 102 is formed 
thereon by thermal oxidation. A polycrystalline silicon 
film 103, a silicon nitride film 104, and a 
polycrystalline silicon film 105 are formed in this order 
on the thermal oxide film 102 by CVD to thicknesses of 
about 1000 angstroms, about 2000 angstroms, and about 
3000 angstroms, respectively. A resist film 106 covering 
element regions is formed on the polycrystalline silicon 
film 105 by photolithography.  By using the resist film 106 as a mask, the exposed 
polycrystalline silicon film 105 is anisotropically ion-etched, 
and the remaining polycrystalline silicon film 
105 is thermally oxidized to form a thick silicon oxide 
film 107 as shown in Fig. 2(b). By using the silicon 
oxide film 107 as a mask, the silicon nitride film 104 is 
anisotropically ion-etched to the intermediate depth of 
the polycrystalline silicon film 103. Thereafter, the 
silicon oxide film 107 is removed by using ammonium 
fluoride (NH₄F). As shown in Fig. 2(c), element isolation regions of 
the semiconductor substrate 101 are oxidized to form a 
field oxide film 108. After the silicon nitride film 104a and 
polycrystalline silicon film 103a shown in Fig. 2(c) are 
removed by chemical dry etching (CDE) and the thermal 
oxide film 102 is etched by NH₄F, a silicon oxide film 
109 having a thickness of about 120 angstroms is
