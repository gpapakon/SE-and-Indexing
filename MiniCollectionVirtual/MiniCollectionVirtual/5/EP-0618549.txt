<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a monitoring method for an electrical apparatus, especially an electrical control. According to the invention, the monitoring method records important events within the apparatus, for example fault messages, alarms or a change of cycle levels, and files messages on the occurrence of these events in a message storage region (17) in chronological order.

Monitoring method for a programmable control system,

wherein important events internal to the control system,
but in particular not only error messages, are detected

by the monitoring method when they occur and filed as
messages in chronological order in a message storage

area (17), the oldest message being overwritten when the
message storage area (17) is fully occupied.
Monitoring method according to claim 1, 
characterised
in that
 the messages are edited, in particular are
provided with the time and location of occurrence of the

important event internal to the control system, before
being filed.
Monitoring method according to claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that
 the important events internal to
the control system also include alarms or interrupts and

changes in operating sequence levels.
Monitoring method according to claim 1, 2 or 3,

characterised in that
 the programmable control system is
controlled by an application program (9) and an

operating system (10) and that the important events
internal to the control system include operating system

events and/or events determined by the application
program (9).
Monitoring method according to one of the above
claims, 
characterised in that
 the filing of new messages
in the message storage area (17) also takes place during

the reading-out of earlier messages from the said
message storage area (17). 
Monitoring method according to one of the above
claims, 
characterised in that
 the filing of the messages
cannot be suppressed.
Programmable control system with means for storing
messages about the chronological order of important

events internal to the control system, but in particular
not only error messages, in a message storage area (17)

which is constructed as a ring or cyclical buffer.
Programmable control system according to claim 7,

characterised in that
 the message storage area 17) is
constructed as a non-volatile storage device, for

example as an EEPROM.
Programmable control system according to claim 7 or
8, 
characterised in that
 the message storage area (17)
is constructed as a storage device which cannot be

erased by the user.
Programmable control system according to claim 7, 8
or 9, 
characterised in that
 it has a program storage
area (11) for storing an operating system (10) and an

application program (9) for the programmable control
system.
