<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a glass antenna
device for an automobile having a high receiving
sensitivity and flatness of receiving sensitivity within
a desired broadcast frequency band region.In a glass antenna for receiving signals in an AM
broadcast frequency band region (hereinbelow, referred to
as an AM band) and an FM broadcast frequency band region
(hereinbelow, referred to as an FM band), there has been
practiced to insert a pre-amplifier at a desired position
in a feeder line between a feeding terminal for an
antenna conductor and a receiver to compensate an
insufficient receiving sensitivity of the antenna.
However, there occurred waveform distortion and cross
modulation in a strong electric field due to the presence
of the pre-amplifier to thereby amplify noises.The conventional technique had problems as follows.
Productivity decreased since it was necessary to dispose
another pre-amplifier in addition to that for the
receiver. Further, the pre-amplifier to be disposed near 
the glass antenna restricted the condition of designing
an automobile, e.g. in obtaining a space for the pre-amplifier.
Accordingly, it has been expected to develop
a glass antenna device for an automobile having a high
receiving sensitivity and non-directivity, and capable of
suppressing noises, without the necessity of the pre-amplifier.In order to eliminate the above-mentioned
disadvantage, a glass antenna device disclosed in U.S.P.
5,083,134 is proposed. The publication discloses an
antenna device for an automobile comprising an electric
heating type defogger having heater strips and a bus bar
for feeding a current to the heater strips and antenna
conductors arranged to form a pattern wherein the
defogger and the antenna conductors are formed on a glass
sheet to be fitted to a rear window opening of an
automobile, and wherein the defogger and the antenna
conductors are disposed with a predetermined small space
in a capacitive coupling relation so that an intermediate
or a high frequency current is caused to flow but a
direct current is not caused to flow between them, and a
reactance circuit is connected between the bus bar and a
d.c. power source for the defogger, whereby there is an
anti-resonance point in a desired broadcast frequency
band region, which is caused by impedance composed mainly
of capacitance which is produced in correlation among the
antenna conductors, the defogger and the body of 
automobile and the impedance of the reactance circuit,
and there is a resonance point in the desired broadcast
frequ
