<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a sheet sorting 
apparatus comprising plural bins trays (B1-BN); bin tray moving 

means for moving said bin trays stepwise to cause each 
of the bin trays to face a sheet receiving position; 

and control means for controlling the operating speed 
of said bin tray moving means according to sheet 

transporting information of an image forming apparatus 
to be connected to said sorting apparatus, in such a 

manner that said bin tray moving means can be operated 
in continuous manner even during the discharge of a 

sheet into a bin tray.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus,
hereinafter called sorter, used for sorting or collation
of sheet-shaped members such as copy sheets, transfer
sheets or recording sheets (hereinafter called "sheets")
discharged from an image forming apparatus such as a
copying machine, a printing press or other recording
equipment, and to an image forming apparatus equipped with
such sheet sorter.In general, such sorter is equipped with 10 to 20,
or more stepped sheet stackers (hereinafter called "bins")
in a mutually spaced arrangement, and the sheets
consecutively discharged from the image forming apparatus
at a predetermined interval are transported in succession
to respective bins by transporting means utilizing a
conveyor belt and/or plural rollers.Such sorters can be classified into movable bin
sorters in which a group of bins for sheet collation moves
with respect to a fixed transport path, and fixed bin
sorters in which the bins are fixed while a discharge unit
moves in succession corresponding to said bins or sheets
are fed into the bins from a main path by means of
flappers (deflecting means). In the conventional movable bin sorters there are
already proposed methods for moving the bins so as to
widen the entrance of a bin when said bin moves to a sheet
receiving position, as disclosed, for example, in the
Japanese Laid-open Patents Nos. 56-78770, 56-78769, 57-4855,
57-4856, and 57-141357.In such apparatus, paired trunnions, mounted on
the entrance end of each bin, are made to engage with a
widening mechanism utilizing a rotary geneva or a lead
cam, thereby widening the spaces of the bins in succession
at the sheet introducing position, and this operation is
gradually displaced over the widening mechanism, thereby
achieving the ascent or descent of the entire bin group.An example of the principal part of such sheet
sorter is illustrated in Figs. 1A and 1B. Bin rollers
151a, 151b, 151c provided on both sides of each of plural
bins Ba, Bb, Bc are vertically movably guided by a pair of
guide rails 152 positioned at left and right, and further
engage, at the end portions of said bin rollers, with cam
grooves of a pair of lead cams 153a, 153b provided at left
and right, thereby being elevated or lowered by the
rotation of said lead cams 153a, 153b in a direction A, D
or in the opposite direction. When the bin rollers 151a,
151b are in the illustrated position on the lead cams
153a, 153b, the space between the bins Ba and Bb and that
between the bins Bb and Bc are locally widened, thereby
facilitating
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>

transported into said bins (B), and
spiral cam means (75) for moving said trunnions of
said bins in such a manner that each of said bins faces said

sheet discharge means,

characterized in
that said spiral cam means (75) is arranged to be
rotatable in a continuous manner,
that said sheet discharge means (86) is arranged to be vertically
movable in correspondence with the moving of said bins

and
