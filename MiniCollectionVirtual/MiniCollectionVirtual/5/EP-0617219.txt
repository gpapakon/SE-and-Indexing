<ABSTRACT>
Use of plastic materials having barrier layers (barrier polymers) in the form of complete laminate composites produced by coextrusion, the laminate films of which are brought into the composite form by adhesion promotion films, as reinforcements in motor vehicle conduits 6. The thickness and the number of laminate films in a complete laminate composite are chosen such that the motor vehicle conduit as a whole satisfies the provisions of DIN 73378.

<CLAIMS>
A motor vehicle pipeline comprising a laminated composite entity (1)
produced by coextrusion, which laminated composite entity (1) exclusively

comprises laminate films (2) which consist of barrier layer synthetic
materials,

wherein all the laminate films (2) are joined by interposed bonding agent
films (3), wherein the thickness of all the laminate films (2) is less than 0.2

mm and the thickness of the bonding agent films (3) is less than the
thickness of the laminate 
films (2),

and wherein materials of the group comprising ethylene/vinyl alcohol
copolymers, polyvinylidene chloride, polyethylene, polypropylene,

polybutene, polymethylpentene, polyoxymethyline, polybutylene
terephthalate, polyethylene terephthalate, polyvinylidene fluoride,

tetrafluoroethylene/hexafluoropropylene copolymers, ethylene/tetraflouoroethylene
copolymers, ethyl cellulose/tetrafluoroethylene

copolymers, a perfluoro-oxyalkane, or compatible mixtures therof, are
used as barrier layer synthetic materials.
A motor vehicle pipeline according to claim 1, with the proviso that the
bonding agent films are arranged to even out shearing stress.
A motor vehicle pipeline according to either one of claims 1 or 2, with the
proviso that all the laminate films consist of the same barrier layer

synthetic material.
A motor vehicle pipeline according to any one of claims 1 to 3, with the
proviso that all the laminate films consist of different barrier layer synthetic

materials.
A motor vehicle pipeline according to any one of claims 1 to 4, with the
proviso that the wall of the entire pipeline is produced as a laminated

composite entity.
A motor vehicle pipeline according to any one of claims 1 to 5, with the
proviso that the laminated composite entity forms at least one layer in the

motor vehicle pipeline and is combined with further layers.
