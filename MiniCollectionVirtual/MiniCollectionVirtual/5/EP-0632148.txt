Disclosed is a fiber for nonwoven fabrics comprising an 
olefin polymer material containing (by weight): 


1) from 50 to 80 parts of a propylene homopolymer having an 
isotactic index greater than 90, or a random copolymer of 

propylene with ethylene and/or a C₄-C₈ α-olefin; and

a copolymer containing from 40 to 70% of ethylene, and 

having an intrinsic viscosity lower than or equal to 1.5 
dl/g, or said copolymer containing less than 40% of 

ethylene and having an intrinsic viscosity lower than or 
equal to 2.3 dl/g; 
 
said fiber being obtained by spinning the above olefin polymer 

material and then drawing it out with a draw-ratio equal to or 
lower than 1.8.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to nonwoven fabrics prepared
by thermobonding which display improved strength and softness
characteristics, and the process for producing them. More
particularly, the present invention relates to a staple fibers
produced by a continuous or discontinuous spinning and drawing
process, using polymer materials which comprise heterophasic
polyolefin compositions, possessing good flexibility and
thermobonding strength.The definition of "fibers" includes also products similar
to fibers, such as fibrils.Nonwoven fabrics are widely used in various applications,
and for some of these applications the softness and strength
of the nonwoven fabrics are particularly desired and requested.
For example, in the health and medical fields, where these
products are used for sanitary napkins, bandages, gowns, etc.,
softness is very important because the product comes in contact
with the skin. Other fields include, for example, the
wrapping and packaging of either fragile or easily damageable
objects, where the material must not only be soft but also
strong in order to help prevent breakage.Polyolefin fibers used for the preparation of nonwoven
materials are already known in the art, said fibers being
optionally prepared with a heterophasic polymer and possessing
thermobonding properties. For example, fibers with the above
mentioned properties are described in published European patent 
application EP-A-391438, in the name of the Applicant. In said
patent application the fibers prepared in the examples comprise
only propylene homopolymer, or ethylene/propylene copolymer
having a thermobonding strength, measured with the method
described below, of up to 4 N.Another example of polyolefin fibers containing
heterophasic polyolefin compositions is given in published
European patent application EP-A-0 552 810 in the name of the
Applicant. Said patent application describes fibers produced
from blends comprising up to 30% of a rubber fraction.The heterophasic polyolefin compositions described in the
above mentioned patent application are suitable for the
preparation of fibers having thermoshrinking characteristics.
Said fibers, which have a high count value (the values,
mentioned only in the examples, range from 15 to 19 dtex), can
be used to produce tufted carpets. However, said patent
application does not refer to other uses and properties of the
fibers, i.e., there is no mention of which compositions are
suitable for the production of fibers having good thermobonding
and flexibility properties, nor
