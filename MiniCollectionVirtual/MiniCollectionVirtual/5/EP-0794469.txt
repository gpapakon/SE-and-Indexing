<ABSTRACT>
An electrophotographic printing process using dry low gloss toner 
formulations for producing either low gloss images or high gloss images. In an 

instance when a low gloss image is produced, the process selects a low gloss 
paper, and all other parameters of the process of printing low gloss images are 

consistent with known parameters for the production of electrophotographic low 
gloss images using dry toner formulations. In order to produce a high gloss 

image using a low gloss toner formulation, the method involves selecting a high 
gloss media, if available, from a media source (21, 23) and reducing the feed 

speed of the media through the process. Additionally, the temperature of fuser 
roller (17) is increased to ensure maximum fixing and fusing of the toner to 

produce a single voidless plane of toner on top of the media which exhibits a 
high reflective index and results in less light scattering at the surface of the 

toner.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to processes for the formation of
images using dry toners and, more specifically, to a process for high gloss image
formation using dry low gloss toner formulations.The technology of electrophotography, is generally characterized
by a process having at least the following steps: charging, exposure,
development, transfer and fusing. Additional steps may be taken in producing
an image or document including cleaning and erasing the photoconductor.In the charging step, the photoconductor is covered with ions of a
selected polarity using a high voltage wire, grid, or charge roller. Exposure
involves the formation of a latent image on the surface of an insulating,
photoconducting material by selectively exposing areas of the surface to a high
energy light source. A difference in electrostatic charge density is created
between the areas on the surface exposed and unexposed to light.A visible image is developed by electrostatic toners. A dry toner
generally has two components, a pigment component and a thermoplastic
binding component. The subtractive set of pigments, cyan, magenta and yellow
are most commonly used for producing color documents or images using the
electrophotographic color laser printing process. Other components may be
added to the toner formulation to enhance certain properties or performance
characteristics of the toners. These include additives to control the rate and
level of charge and additives for enhancing flow. Oil is sometimes added in the
fusing process to inhibit adhesion of the toner to the fuser rollers.The toner is selectively attracted to the photoconductor surface
dependent upon the degree of exposure to light and the relative electrostatic
charges of the photoconductor surface, development electrode and the toner. 
The photoconductor may be either positively or negatively charged, and the
toner system similarly may contain negatively or positively charged particles.In the transfer step, media, most often in the form of a sheet of
paper, is given an electrostatic charge opposite that of the toner and passed
along in close proximity to the photoconductor surface to transfer toner and,
consequently, the latent image from the photoconductor surface onto the media.
Following transfer of the toner in the form of the latent image from the
photoconductor surface to the media, the media is passed between a pair of
fuser rollers. The pressure and heat of the rollers fixes the toner in the media.There are a number of electrophotographic color laser
