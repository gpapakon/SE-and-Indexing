<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and a mould for producing plastic articles, which have at least one plastic body and a film part (38, 50, 74), the plastic body being moulded onto the film part (38, 50, 74) in a mould. It is proposed that the film (34) is inserted into the mould (13, 24) and that the film part (38, 50, 74) is punched out by means of a cutting die (28, 44, 68) of a punching device (24) and that the plastic body is moulded onto the film part (38, 50, 74) in the same mould (13, 24). The mould for carrying out the method is accordingly designed such that the film part (38, 50, 74) punched out by the punching device (24) can be inserted by means of the punching device (24) into the injection-moulding device (13). As a result, the handling costs caused by the inserting of the film parts (38, 50, 74) are reduced and incorrect insertion is avoided.
