<ABSTRACT>
A towed array streamer and method for making the streamer, which streamer is of a generally solid construction. The streamer includes a centrally located buoyant core (1) and includes a gel filled layer (2) carrying data bearers (3) around that core (1). An outer jacket (4) encases an inner portion of the streamer. Filler cords (7) may also be aligned within the gel filled layer (2) to provide support for the gel whilst the streamer is being assembled. Strength members (5) may optionally be included within the gel layer (2) or within an inner jacket (6) formed immediately inside of the outer jacket (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a towed array streamer according to the
preamble of claim 1.Towed array streamers usually comprise an elongate buoyant streamer
having spaced along its length the required payload. Streamers are generally
made from several shorter modules which are joined together to form the full
length, and the modules used along the length have varying structures and
are designed to perform different functions. The reason for positioning more
than one type of module along the length of the streamer is in part because
prevailing ambient conditions and forces associated with towing vary along
the length. This invention is especially suited to a module that carries sensors
such as hydrophones.Towed streamers are usually of considerable length and are subject to quite
high towing strains and are consequently provided with high tensile or non-compliant
strain members to transmit tension along the streamer. The
streamers however must also be sufficiently flexible for winching onto a
bollard or the like.The strength members by their very nature are designed to carry a significant
portion of the towing load, and it is desirable that the rest of the streamer is
subjected to minimal strain.Streamers are generally of one of two types. One such type are liquid filled
and these have been used as a prior ait, and generally have strength
members, the pay load and data transmission means within a liquid core with
a jacket encapsulating these components. The liquid used in such streamers
fills most of the streamer and can be a hydrocarbon such as kerosene. Such
streamers are generally less robust than streamers of a generally solid nature,
arid generally have a shorter life. Streamers of solid construction however
suffer from the disadvantage of having a somewhat reduced sensitivity of the
payload. with a far greater noise transmitted by reason of transfer of tension 
through solid layers onto the sensors either directly or indirectly
through data bearer cables connected thereto.The towed array streamer according to the preamble of claim 1 is
known from GB-2,226,690 A. Gel filling is used to provide a void-free
fill. From WO 83/00564 a towed streamer is known being impregnated
with a low specific gravity gel to obtain void-free filling.It has been shown that noise is generated by the strength member
and the external milieu and the invention aims to overcome this
drawback.It is a further object of this invention to
provide a towed streamer that is of solid
construction, and has improved isolation of the

<CLAIMS>
A towed array streamer of generally solid construction including an inner
portion comprising a generally solid buoyant core (1), a gel filled layer (2) surrounding

the buoyant core, a generally solid outer jacket (4) encasing the inner portion of the
streamer, strength members (5) positioned within the streamer and spaced from the

buoyant core (1) so as to transmit tension along the streamer, and databearers (3) within
the gel filled layer, 
characterised in that
 the gel comprises a rheologically modifiable
gel 
(2) and 
in that
 filler cord members (7) are provided within the layer (2) of rheologically
modifiable gel longitudially in line with the buoyant core, the databearers comprising a

layer separate from the filler members (7) such that the layer of gel (2) isolates the
databearers (3) from the remainder of the cable and preventing a solid-solid interface.
A towed attay streamer as in claim 1 wherein the data bearers (3)
comprise a plurality of data wires braided atound the buoyant cote (t).
A towed attay streamer as in claim 1 including a resilient inner jacket
(6) around the gel filled layer (2), and said inner jacket forming part of the

inner portion of the streamer and being encased by the outer jacket (1), the
strength members (5) being longitudinally positioned and being embedded

within the inner jacket.
A towed array streamer as in any one of the preceding claims
wherein the means to encase the gel filled layer is a paper wrap (8).
A towed array streamer as in claim 1 wherein the strength members
(5) are laid longitudinally within the gel filled layer (2) surrounding the buoyant

core (1). 
A method of making a towed array streamer including the steps of
extruding a buoyant core (1), aligning a plurality of filler cord members (7)

around and longitudinally in line with the buoyant core (1), braiding a plurality of data-bearer wires (3)
around the filler members, filling gel throughout and over the data bearer

wires, encasing the gel filled layer (2) with a casing (8), and including the
step of aligning strength members spaced from the buoyant core and so as

to transmit tension along the streamer thereby forming an inner portion of
the towed streamer cable and forming an outer jacket over said inner

portion the gel filled layer being provided such that the data
bearer wires (3) are isolated from the remainder of the cable and

preventing a solid-solid interface.
A method of making a towed array streamer as in claim 6 wherein the
method includes the step of surrounding the casing (8) with an inner jacket

layer (6), said inner jacket being part of the inner portion.
A method of making a towed array streamer as in claim 6 wherein the
casing is formed by spirally wrapping the gel filled layer with a paper strip

(8).
A method of making a towed array streamer as in claim 6 wherein
strength members (5) are positioned in longitudinal alignment over the

casing (8) before the step of forming the inner jacket (66), and the step of
forming the inner jacket includes extruding the inner jacket around the

strength members (5).
A method of making a towed array streamer cable as in claim 6
wherein the method includes the step of aligning a plurality of strength

members (5) around the buoyant core (1), before the data bearer layer is
formed.
A method of making a towed attay streamer as in claim 7 wherein the
method includes the step of aligning a plurality of strength members (5)
