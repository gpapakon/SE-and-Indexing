<ABSTRACT>
A foldable bicycle frame comprises a front frame (A) made up of a 
head tube (11), a top tube (12) and a down tube (13), and a rear frame 

(B) made up of a seat tube (14), a bottom bracket tube (15), a seat stay 
(16) and a chain stay (17). The top tube (12) is provided at the rear 

end thereof with a connection tube (18) to receive therein a seat post 
(19). The bottom bracket tube (15) is provided at the center of the 

front end thereof with an extension tube (21) which faces the front 
wheel and is pivoted at the front end thereof to the bottom end of the 

down tube (13). The front frame (A) and the rear frame (B) are fastened 
together by means of the seat post (19) which is inserted into the 

connection tube (18) and the seat tube (14). The front frame (A) and the 
rear frame (B) are rotatable in relation to each other when the seat 

post (19) is pulled out of the seat tube (14).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a foldable bicycle 
frame, and more particularly to the folding and the 
fastening structures of the foldable bicycle frame. A foldable bicycle is different from a non-foldable 
bicycle in that the former has a frame that can be folded to 
reduce its length and volume so as to facilitate its storage 
and transportion. The prior art foldable bicycle frame is 
provided at an appropriate location thereof with a joint 
permitting the frame to be folded in such a manner that the 
front wheel and the rear wheel are arranged side by side or 
near to each other. It is expensive to build a foldable  
 
bicycle in view of the fact that the foldable bicycle has 
a folding joint of complex construction and vulnerable to 
becoming loosened. For this reason, the frame of the 
foldable bicycle is relatively less able to withstand a 
percussive force. With a view to overcoming such a 
structural deficiency of the prior art foldable bicycle 
frame, this applicant has disclosed a number of improved 
foldable bicycle frames, as exemplified in a U.S. Patent 
No. 5222751. However, such improved frames disclosed by 
this applicant are by no means free from the structural 
deficiency. Another foldable bicycle is disclosed NL-A-39850 
and a bicycle having two separable frame parts is 
disclosed in FR-A-1415802. It is a primary object of the present invention to 
provide a foldable bicycle frame with a lower rotating 
point having a great structural strength to facilitate the 
manufacture and the assembly of the foldable bicycle. It is another object of the present invention to 
provide a foldable bicycle frame, which can be fastened 
securely so that it will not loosen. According to the invention there is provided a 
foldable bicycle frame comprising a front frame made up of 
a head tube, a top tube and a down tube, and a rear frame 
made up of a seat tube, a bottom bracket tube, a seat stay 
and a chain stay; wherein said top tube is provided at the  
 
rear end thereof with a connection tube; wherein said 
bottom bracket tube is provided at the front end thereof 
with an extension tube, facing a front wheel, with said 
extension tube having a front end that is pivoted to a 
bottom end of said down tube; wherein said front frame and 
said rear frame are fastened securely by means of a seat 
post which is inserted into said connection tube and said 
seat tube; and wherein said front frame and said rear frame 
can be rotated oppositely when said seat post is removed 
from said connection tube

A foldable bicycle frame comprising a front frame 
(A) made up of a head tube (11) , a top tube (12) and a 

down tube (13), and a rear frame (B) made up of a seat tube 
(14), a bottom bracket tube (15), a seat stay (16) and a 

chain stay (17); wherein said top tube (12) is provided at 
the rear end thereof with a connection tube (18); wherein 

said bottom bracket tube (15) is provided at the front end 
thereof with an extension tube (21), facing a front wheel, 

with said extension tube (21) having a front end that is 
pivoted to a bottom end of said down tube (13); wherein 

said front frame (A) and said rear frame (B) are fastened 
securely by means of said seat post (19) which is inserted 

into said connection tube (18) and said seat tube (14); and 
wherein said front frame (A) and said rear frame (B) can be 

rotated oppositely when said seat post (19) is removed from 
said connection tube (18) and said seat tube (14). 
The foldable bicycle frame of Claim 1, wherein said 
extension tube (21) has a front end provided with an axial 

tube (22); and wherein said down tube (13) has a rear end 
provided with an axial rod (23) fitted pivotally into said 

axial tube (22). 
The foldable bicycle frame of Claim 1, wherein said 
top tube (12) is provided with an axial rod (26) fitted 

pivotally into an axial tube (27); and wherein a reinforce  
 

tube (133) is fastened with one end to said seat tube (14) 
and with another end that is fastened to said axial tube 

(27).
