<ABSTRACT>
A medium for anaerobiotically enumerating propionic bacteria, including a complex medium consisting particularly of a mixture of a casein hydrolysate and a yeast extract along with at least one lithium compound such as lithium lactate as well as a polyol such as glycerol and/or one or more antibiotics. Bacteria are enumerated in a biological sample by anaerobiotically incubating said sample or decimal dilutions thereof in the enumeration medium.

<CLAIMS>
Medium for the counting under anaerobic conditions of
propionic bacteria 
characterised in that
 it comprises a complex medium
supplemented with on the one hand at least one lithium compound and on

the other glycerol or erythritol and/or one or more antibiotics selected from
fosfomycin, aminosides, polypeptides, first or second generation quinolones

or imidazoles to which the propionic bacteria are resistant.
Medium according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the
complex medium comprises a mixture of a casein hydrolysate and a yeast

extract.
Medium according to one of claims 1 and 2, 
characterised in
that
 it is in agar form.
Medium according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in
that
 it contains from 0.2 % to 2 % by weight of the medium of a lithium
compound and from 0.01 % to 2 % by weight of the medium of glycerol or

erythritol.
Medium according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in
that
 the lithium compound is lithium lactate, lithium hydroxide or lithium
chloride.
Medium according to claim 5, 
characterised in that
 it contains
between 2 and 20 g/l, preferably between 5 and 15 g/l and even more

preferably about 10 g/l of lithium lactate.
Medium according to claim 6, 
characterised in that
 it contains
between 0.1 to 20 g/l, preferably from 2 to 10 g/l and even more preferably

about 6 g/l of glycerol.
Medium according to one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in
that
 it comprises about:

10 g of yeast extract
10 g of lithium lactate
0.25 g of K
2
HPO
4
0.05 g of MnSO
4
6 g of glycerol
15 g of agar
0.05 g of bromocresol purple
1 000 ml of water

the pH of the medium being adjusted to 7.
Medium according to one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in
that
 the concentration of each antibiotic into the medium is between 2 and
500 mg/l.
Medium according to one of claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in
that
 it contains between 0.05 % and 5 % of milk.
Method for counting propionic bacteria in a biological
sample, 
characterised in that
 said sample or decimal dilutions of it are
incubated anaerobically in a medium according to one of claims 1 to 10 and


in that
 said bacteria are then counted by known methods.
