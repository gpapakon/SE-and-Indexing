<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a method of 
measuring the depth of a dicing groove, employing an 

ultrasonic detector, capable of measuring the depth of 
the groove in a high accuracy when the groove is cut in 

a full-cut mode. A method according to the present 
invention employes an ultrasonic detector which emits 

ultrasonic waves, measures the time interval between the 
emission of the ultrasonic waves and the return of 

their echo, the phase difference between the emitted 
ultrasonic waves and the reflected ultrasonic waves, or 

both the time interval and the phase difference to 
measure the depth of the groove. The method of the 

present invention is featured by determining the depth 
of the dicing groove on the basis of the depth of the 

groove formed in an exposed area of the adhesive sheet 
not occupied by the workpiece.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
measuring a groove formed by a dicing apparatus, by an 
ultrasonic detector, and a dicing apparatus provided 
with an ultrasonic detector and capable of measuring the 
depth of a groove and, more particularly, to a method 
capable of very accurately measuring the depth of a 
dicing groove cut in a workpiece in a full-cut mode in 
which the dicing groove is cut as deep as the periphery 
of a cutting blade which reaches the surface of an 
adhesive sheet fixedly holding the workpiece to dice 
the workpiece completely and the depth of a dicing 
groove cut in the workpiece in a half-cut mode in which 
the dicing groove is cut so that the workpiece is not 
diced completely, and to a dicing apparatus for 
carrying out the same. A dicing apparatus, which cuts a narrow groove in a 
workpiece with a cutting blade rotating at a high 
rotating speed, is applied widely to cutting of 
semiconductor wafers provided with semiconductor 
devices thereon, into semiconductor chips. A dicing 
apparatus as applied, by way of example, to cutting a 
groove in a semiconductor wafer will be described. In the dicing apparatus, a stage supporting the 
semiconductor wafer is moved relative to a cutting 
blade rotating at a high speed to cut a groove in the 
semiconductor wafer. Although the semiconductor wafer 
is fixedly supported on the stage, generally, the 
semiconductor wafer is stuck on an adhesive sheet, and 
then the adhesive sheet adhesively holding the 
semiconductor wafer is held fixedly on the stage to  
 
prevent semiconductor chips formed by dicing the 
semiconductor wafer from scattering during processing. 
A workpiece other than a semiconductor wafer may be 
directly attached to the stage with an adhesive. An 
adhesive sheet is stuck to one surface of a frame 
having a central hole formed by punching and having a 
diameter greater than that of the semiconductor wafer, 
and the semiconductor wafer 1 is stuck on the adhesive 
surface of the adhesive sheet, and the frame thus 
holding the semiconductor wafer is fixedly mounted on 
the stage. In production processes of semiconductor 
devices, a semiconductor wafer is transferred from one 
process to the next in a state described above. When cutting a groove in the semiconductor wafer, 
the groove is cut, depending on the requirements of the 
following processes, in a full-cut mode in which the 
groove is cut so that the semiconductor chips are diced 
completely or in a half-cut mode in which the groove is 
cut in the
