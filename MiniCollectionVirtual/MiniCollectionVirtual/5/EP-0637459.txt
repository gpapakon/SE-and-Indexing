<ABSTRACT>
In a three-piece solid golf ball 
comprising a center core, an intermediate layer, 

and a cover, the center core (1) has a diameter 
of at least 26 mm and a specific gravity of less 

than 1.4, the intermediate layer (2) has a 
thickness of at least 1 mm, a specific gravity 

of less than 1.2, and a hardness of less than 80 
on JIS C scale and the cover (3) has a thickness 

of 1-3 mm. The ball has a good total balance 
of properties in that feeling is improved at no 

sacrifice of flying performance and durability.

<DESCRIPTION>
Golf balls of various structures are
currently on the market. Among others, two-piece
solid golf balls and thread-wound golf
balls share the majority of the market. The
two-piece solid golf ball has a rubber based
core and an enclosing cover typically of ionomer
resin while the thread-would golf ball is
produced by winding thread rubber around a solid
or liquid center and enclosing the center in a
cover.Most amateur golfers are fond of two-piece
solid golf balls which have excellent
flying performance and durability although these
balls have the disadvantages of a very hard feel 
on hitting and low control due to rapid ball
separation on hitting. For this reason, many of
professional golfers and skilled amateur golfers
prefer wound golf balls to two-piece solid golf
balls. The wound golf balls are superior in
feeling and control, but inferior in flying
distance and durability to the two-piece solid
golf balls.Under the present situation that two-piece
solid golf balls and wound golf balls have
contradictory characteristics as mentioned
above, players make a choice of golf balls
depending on their own skill and taste.In order to develop solid golf balls
having a hitting feel approximate to the wound
golf balls, two-piece solid golf balls of soft
type have been considered. For such two-piece
solid golf balls of soft type, soft cores must
be used. If the cores are soft, however,
repulsion becomes low with a concomitant loss of
flying performance and durability is
considerably deteriorated. That is, the
superior flying performance and durability which
are characteristic of two-piece solid golf
balls are lost, and in an extreme case, the 
balls become unacceptable for practical use.
Differently stated, since conventional two-piece
solid golf balls have the structure which
is determined by optimizing three parameters,
softness, repulsion and durability, one of these
parameters can be improved only at the sacrifice
of the other parameters.An aim herein is to provide a novel and useful solid
golf ball construction. A preferred aim is to achieve a
good feel while maintaining the good flying performance
and durability which are characteristic of solid golf
balls.In connection with a solid golf ball
having a core forming the center and a cover
forming the outermost layer, we have
found that by providing a soft intermediate
layer between the center core and the cover,
the
center core can be made relatively soft so as to
improve feeling without deteriorating flying
performance and durability. The hitting feel 
can
