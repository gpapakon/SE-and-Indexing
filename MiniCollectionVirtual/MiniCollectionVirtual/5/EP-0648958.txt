<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a motor vehicle gear box, particularly with a low speed gear train, with at least one input shaft (1), which can be driven by way of at least one clutch (not shown) and fixed and unfixed gear wheels (10, 11, 12 and 13, 14) arranged thereon, and two, first and second, output shafts (2 and 3) acting via respective fixed pinions (5 and 6) on the input gear wheel (7) of a differential (8) and having fixed and unfixed gear wheels (16, 17 and 19, 20; 24, 26 and 27) arranged thereon, each fixed gear wheel on one shaft being in continuous engagement with an unfixed gear wheel on another shaft and the unfixed gear wheels being selectively connectable for driving purposes to their shafts by means of synchronising devices (15, 18, 25 and 28) adjacent to them, and at least the unfixed gear wheel (24) with the largest diameter being connectable to a shaft by way of a one-way clutch (32) which locks only in the driving direction and by way of a synchronising device (25). In addition to the usual support for the gear wheel hub (30), the one-way clutch (32) is arranged on an outer circumference (31) of the gear wheel hub (30), between the latter and a separate gear ring (33).

A change-speed gearbox for motor vehicles, particularly
one having a low gear, comprising an at least one drive

shaft (1), drivable through at least one separating coupling
(not shown), said shaft carrying fixed gearwheels (10, 11

and 12) and loose gearwheels (13 and 14), and two first and
second output shafts (2 and 3) each acting through a fixed

pinion (5 and 6) on an input gearwheel (7) of a differential
(8) and carrying loose gearwheels (16 and 17; 24, 26 and 27)

and fixed gearwheels (19 and 20), with in each case a fixed
and a loose gearwheel on different shafts being in constant

mesh and the loose gearwheels being selectively drivingly
connectable to their shafts through adjacent synchronisers

(15, 18, 25 and 28) and with at least the largest diameter
loose gearwheel (24) being connectable to its shaft through

a one-way clutch (32) which can only lock in the driving
direction and a synchroniser (25),

characterised in that

in addition to the usual mounting of the gearwheel hub
(30) on a bearing on the output shaft (3), the one-way

clutch (32) is fitted on an outer circumference (31) of
the gearwheel hub (30), between said hub and a separate

ring gear (33).

(15, 18, 25 and 28),

characterised in that

in addition to the usual mounting of the gearwheel hub
(30') on a bearing on the second output shaft (3) a

bearing arrangement (36) is provided on an outer
circumference (31') of the gearwheel hub (30') between

said hub and a separate ring gear (33'), and
parallel to the gearwheel hub (30') a disc member (37)
connected non-rotatably to the separate ring gear (33')

is mounted rotatably on the gearwheel hub (30') at the
inner circumference (38) of the disc member (37), and

has the brake cone (39) and the coupling teeth (40) for
the adjacent synchroniser (25) formed on its hub.
