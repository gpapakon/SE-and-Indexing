<ABSTRACT>
A beverage dispenser has a tray assembly for holding 
at least three containers (14), each having a plurality of 

electrodes (60). An electrical system provides a voltage to 
one electrode in each container, and detects when the 

syrup is below a certain level. Each container (14) is in a 
refrigerated compartment (12) and has an opening (16) at the top 

aligned with an opening in the cabinet. A funnel (20) is 
provided in the opening (18) in the cabinet and extends into 

the container. The refrigerated compartment (12) also 
encloses a pump (23) for pumping syrup. The pump is partly 

controlled by circuitry on a circuit board (100) which is 
mounted within the cabinet. A removable metal plate (110) 

covers the cabinet in front of the circuit board. A 
transparent plastic shield (112) is provided intermediate the 

plate and the circuit board, so that a user can observe 
the circuit board when the plate is removed. The shield 

is waterproof to protect the circuit board from splashing 
liquids.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a beverage dispenser, and 
more particularly to a dispenser for combining 
water and a concentrated syrup to produce a drink. In typical juice dispensers, concentrated juice is 
provided as a syrup in a plastic container or in a 
bag-in-box container which is kept in a refrigerated 
compartment. The syrup is pumped from the container in 
the refrigerated compartment to a mixing valve. The 
mixing valve also receives cool water which is combined 
with the syrup to provide a cool drink. In most beverage dispensers, such as the dispenser 
shown and described in Reissue Patent No. 33,943, which 
is assigned to the same assignee as the present 
invention, and which is hereby incorporated by reference, 
there are typically one or two containers of juice. The 
dispenser may have an out-of-syrup sensor which provides 
a visual indication to the user when the concentrated 
syrup in the container fall below a certain level. 
Electrodes on the side of the containers are "hot" and 
the horizontal base has a grounded vertical extension 
which extends upward between the containers. This tray 
system and electrode arrangement does not work, however, 
when there are more than two concentrated juice 
containers. Syrup in the container is pumped from the container 
to the mixing valve. When syrup is not drawn from a 
container for an extended period of time, the syrup in 
the pump can become warm. As a result, the next beverage 
which is dispensed may be unacceptably warm to the 
drinker.  When the container runs out, a new container is 
provided, or a funnel is used in the top of the dispenser 
to refill the container. In the top-fill system of the 
reissue patent, a rubber gasket is provided between the 
funnel and the metal housing of the dispenser. This 
gasket can get syrup on it and require cleaning. It 
would be desirable to have a funnel system which is 
easier to clean and maintain. Typical dispensers have a splash plate for 
protecting controls on the inside of the cabinet in case 
a juice splashes. This can occur, for example, if a 
glass is not properly positioned beneath the spout and 
the juice splashes from a tray on which a glass normally 
rests. When using microprocessor controls, diagnostic 
tests can be performed, and the circuit board may have 
lights or indicators which show the results of the 
diagnostic tests. Consequently, it is desirable to operate the 
dispenser while being able to observe the circuit board, 
and would be desirable to protect the circuit board while 
bei

syrup; 
   means for providing water; 

   means for combining the syrup from the container and 
the water from the providing means; 

   a pump coupled to the container for pumping syrup 
from the container to the combining means, the pump 

 
having a conduit passing therethrough, and a housing for 

enclosing the conduit, wherein the housing is enclosed 
within the refrigerated compartment.
