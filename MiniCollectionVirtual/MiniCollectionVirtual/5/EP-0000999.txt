<ABSTRACT>
A titanium trichloride composition has the formula:
 

TiCl₃(AlR
x
X
3-x
)
n
E
a
L
b

 
where E is an ether or thioether; L is a defined ester, an 

amine or a ketone; and a and b are each greater than 0.001 
and not more than 0.50. The composition has a low surface 

area, typically less than 50 m²/g. The composition can be 
prepared by reacting titanium tetrachloride with an organo-aluminium 

compound, optionally heating the reaction product, 
contacting the reaction product at an elevated temperature 

with at least one of E and L and washing the product 
subsequent to the treatment with E. In the composition, 

E is conveniently di-n-butyl ether or diisoamyl ether 
and L can be tetramethylethylenediamine; ethyl benzoate; 

benzophenone; glycerol monostearate; glycerol triacetate; 
glycerol tripalmitate; glycerol trimethacrylate; pentaerythritol 

tetra-acrylate or ethyl phenyl acetate. The composition 
can be used as a component of a catalyst for the polymerisation 

of olefine monomers such as propylene. Copolymers 
having a useful combination of properties can be obtained.
