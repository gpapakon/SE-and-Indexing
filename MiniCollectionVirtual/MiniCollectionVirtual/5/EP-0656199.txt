<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a hip joint acetabular cup for fitting into bone tissue, with an outer metal shell (1) and an inner ceramic shell (2), the ceramic shell (2) being anchored in the metal shell (1). In order to reduce the overall size, while simultaneously reducing the wall thickness of the ceramic shell (2), it is proposed for   - the inside of the metal shell (1) and the outside of the ceramic shell (2) to have an exactly fitting circular contour matched to each other, and - means for homogenising force transmission to be arranged between the ceramic shell (2) and the metal shell (1).

Hip-joint socket for insertion into bone tissue
having an outer metal shell (1) and an inner ceramic

shell (2), with the ceramic shell (2) being anchored in
the metal shell (1) and with means for homogenizing the

force-transmission being arranged between the ceramic
shell (2) and the metal shell (1), 
characterized in
that
 the inside of the metal shell (1) and the outside
of the ceramic shell (2) have spherical contours that

are adapted to each other and are an exact fit, and 
in
that
 the means for homogenizing the force transmission
is a surface roughening (6) which is applied to the

inside of the metal shell (1), whereby the surface is
plastically deformable and the surface roughening (6)

has a roughness of 4 µm to 100 µm, excepting a
roughness of 4 µm, and 
in that
 a holding ring (5),
which is secured to the edge of the metal shell (1),

anchors the ceramic shell (2) in the metal shell (1).
Hip-joint socket according to claim 1,

characterized in that
 the surface roughening (6) has a
roughness of 20 µm to 40 µm.
Hip-joint socket according to claim 1 or 2,

characterized in that
 the surface roughening (6) has an
irregular structure which is produced, for example, by

grinding.
Hip-joint socket according to claim 1 or 2,

characterized in that
 the surface roughening (6) has a
regular structure which is produced, for example, by

turning.
Hip-joint socket according to claim 4,

characterized in that
 the regular structure is 
constituted by concentric circles (4).
Hip-joint socket according to claim 4,

characterized in that
 the regular structure has a
spiral shape (12) that is produced by turning.
