<ABSTRACT>
A latch controlled output driver including an output 
driver circuit having a pull-up transistor and a pull-down 

transistor connected in series, wherein the pull-up 
transistor has a drain connected to an upper power supply 

voltage and a source connected to a drain of the pull-down 
transistor and the pull-down transistor has a source 

connected to a lower power supply voltage. The latch 
controlled output driver also includes a first latch 

circuit having an output connected to the gate of the 
pull-up transistor and a second latch circuit having an 

output connected to the gate of the pull-down transistor. 
A control circuit is connected to the first and second 

latches, wherein the control circuit may selectively 
disable and enable the latch controlled output driver in 

response to a control signal. A driver output is connected 
between the pull-up and pull-down transistors, wherein the 

output driver is in an open state when the latch controlled 
output driver is disabled by the control circuit. A data 

circuit is connected to the first and second latch 
circuits, wherein the data circuit stores the state of the 

first and second latches present when the latch controlled 
output driver is enabled and restores the state of the 

first and second latches when the latch controlled output 
driver is enabled after being disabled.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of
microelectronics and in particular to digital circuits.
Still more particularly, the present invention relates to
output drivers in digital circuits.In a digital circuit system, a common path is often
used to share and transfer data between various circuits
and devices in the system. A small set of shared lines, a
bus, may be used to provide the common path. In the
designing of digital circuit systems, some devices may have
an insufficient amount of maximum output current to drive
all of the lines connected to the devices. As a result, a
current amplifier, called a driver or a buffer, is used to
provide the needed currents.Latches are often used to control output drivers in
digital circuit systems. In some instances it is desirable
to enable and disable the output driver. For example, the
output driver may be disabled (placed into an open state)
so that another logic device may drive the same line that
the output driver is connected to. Previously, latches
were enabled and disabled using a logic gate placed between
the latch and the output driver as shown in Figure 1.Referring to Figure 1, a schematic diagram of a latch
controlled output driver 70 known in the prior art is
depicted. Latch controlled output driver circuit 70
includes an input circuit 71, a latch circuit 72, an
enable/disable circuit 74, and an output driver circuit 76.
Input circuit 71 is constructed from pass gates G1 and G2 
and inverter I1; latch circuit 72 is constructed from
inverters I2-I5. Enable/disable circuit 74 is constructed
from NAND gates A1 and A2 and inverters I6 and I7, and
output driver circuit 76 includes transistors T1 and T2.
Transistor T1 is a pull-up transistor and transistor T2 is
a pull-down transistor in the output driver portion of this
circuit. Transistors T1 and T2 are n-channel metal-oxide
field effect transistors (MOSFETs). The drain of
transistor T1 is connected to power supply voltage VCC, and
the source of transistor T2 is connected to power supply
voltage VSS. Typically, power supply voltage VCC is at a
higher voltage than power supply voltage VSS.Signals are input into latch controlled output driver
circuit 70 at inputs GDT and GDC. The gate of transistor
T1 is controlled by a signal entering the latch controlled
output driver at input GDT; the gate of transistor T2 is
controlled by a signal entering the latch controlled output
driver 70 at input GDC. Pass gates G1 and G2 control the
flow of the signal from inputs GDT and GDC to output driver
circuit 76.
