<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a chaos detection
system, more particularly to a chaos processor which is able
to determine whether an input signal is obtained from a random
noise or from a meaningful information containing qualitative
features of the strange attractor.Recently, there have been active studies for seeking a
process for estimating the future movements of the nature
phenomena, such as the flow of water, air, and blood etc., the
movement may be predetermined by the mathematical regularity
of the movements gained.A dynamical system can be defined as a system in which its
states are varying with respect to time.The dynamical system is called a stable system when the
steady state solution remains in one point, which is in turn
called an equilibrium point. When the attractor of the system
makes a closed loop, the system is called a periodic system.
When the attractor has a shape of doughnut, it is called a
quasi-periodic system. The procedure for obtaining the attractor of the dynamical
system will be described as follows.Generally, an nth order dynamical system has n state
equations, and the state equations indicate the variation
ratio of the states of the dynamical system against the
variation of time as shown in equation (1).
dx1/dt = f(x1, x2, ..., xn),
...dxn/dt = f(x1, x2, ..., xn)
where, f: Rn - Rn stands for a nonlinear mapping, and x1,
x2, ..., xn stands for states respectively.Hereinafter, a pendulum motion will be described as an
elemental example of the dynamical system, the pendulum motion
is expressed by 2 state equations in that the pendulum motion
is a second order dynamical system as follows.
dx1/dt = f(x1, x2)dx2/dt = f(x1, x2)The solutions of the above state equations consist of a
transient solution and a steady state solution. The steady
state solution can be expressed in a state space, in which
each state variable makes an axis of the state space, so as to
express the steady state solution entirely.Namely, the steady state solution at a given time can be
expressed as a point in the state space. A set of the points
presented in the state space is called an attractor of 
dynamical system.If the given dynamical system has a finite state, i.e., a
finite nth order dynamics system, the system has a four forms
of the attractor. Dynamical systems are classified into
four types according to the types of the attractor of the
dynamical system.Namely, the steady linear system which is the most simple
dynamical system has one point attractor in the state space,
which is called an
