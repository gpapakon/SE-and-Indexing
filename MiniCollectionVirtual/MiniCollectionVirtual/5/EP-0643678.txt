<ABSTRACT>
Ethyltoluene is produced by ethylating toluene in the presence of a ZSM-5 catalyst of controlled acidity and diffusivity to produce an ethyltoluene isomer mixture which is high in the content of the meta isomer and very low in the ortho isomer. The weight ratio of the meta isomer to the para-isomer is at least 1:1, preferably at least 1.2:1 while the ortho isomer is kept below 1.5 %, preferably below 0.5 %. The product ethyltoluene may be dehydrogenated to form polymerization grade vinyl toluene.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the 
production of ethyltoluene and more particularly, to a 
process for the production of a mixture of ethyltoluene 
isomers having a high content of the meta isomer and a 
very low quantity of the ortho isomer. Vinyl toluene is an important industrial commodity 
chemical used for the production of polymers. For 
certain purposes, it is desirable to produce vinyl 
toluene with a relatively high content of the meta 
isomer (m-methyl styrene), typically from 50 to 70% of 
the total vinyl toluene content. At the same time, a 
very low content of the ortho isomer (o-methyl styrene) 
is desired since this material acts as a chain stopper 
in polymerization. Normally, a maximum content of the 
ortho isomer of 1.5% and preferably below 1 or 0.5% must 
be adhered to for a commercially acceptable material. Vinyl toluene is produced from ethyltoluene by 
dehydrogenation with the isomer ratio of the vinyl 
toluene product being directly dependent upon the isomer 
ratio of the ethyltoluene precursor. Thus, the 
ethyltoluene should typically contain from 50 to 70% of 
the meta isomer and not more than 1% ortho isomer with 
the balance being made up of the para isomer. Ethyltoluene may be produced by the ethylation of 
toluene in the presence of an acidic catalyst and for 
this purpose, Lewis acid type catalysts such as aluminum 
chloride as well as heterogeneous zeolite catalyst have 
been used. Homogenous phase Lewis acid catalysts such 
as aluminum trichloride are effective for the ethylation 
of toluene under relatively mild conditions to produce 
an ethyltoluene product in which the isomer ratio is 
relatively close to the equilibrium ratio of 31.5% para, 
50.2% meta and 18.3% ortho. U. S. Patent No. 4,143,084 
(Kaeding), for example, discloses (Example 13) a process  
 
in which toluene is ethylated in the presence of aluminum chloride to 
produce ethyltoluene with a p-:m-:o- isomer ratio of 27:60:13. While this 
ethyltoluene product has the requisite content of the meta isomer, the ortho 
isomer is present in excessive amounts. An intermediate pore size zeolite such as ZSM-5 may be used to 
catalyze the ethylation of toluene, typically using temperatures in the range 
of 260° to 455°C (500° to 850°F). The isomer ratio of the product varies 
according to the specific shape selectivity characteristics of the zeolite 
component of the catalyst. If ZSM-5 is used in its hydrogen form without 
modification, the ethyltoluene product has an isomer ratio which is relatively 
clos
