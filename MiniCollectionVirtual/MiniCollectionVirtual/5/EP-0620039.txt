<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a homogenising device (1) or the like, having at least one rotor and a stator, rotor and stator having through-holes, slots or similar orifices which, when the rotor rotates with respect to the stator, alternately pass by each other and temporarily align with each other, the medium to be processed passing through these through-holes or the like being homogenised, dispersed or treated in like manner. The invention is characterised in particular in that the cross-section of the through-holes (19) of at least one rotor (27) can be adjusted, in the sense of changing the through-hole cross-section, at rest or during the operation of the homogenisation device (1).
