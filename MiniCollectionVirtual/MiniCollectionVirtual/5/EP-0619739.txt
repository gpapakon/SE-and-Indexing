<ABSTRACT>
An improved pharmaceutical composition useful in ophthalmic surgery is described. The composition includes a mydriatic agent, such as epinephrine in an acidic solution. The acidic solution preferably also contains glutathione. The composition is preferably formulated as a two-part solution, with the mydriatic agent being included in a relatively small volume, acid solution, and one or more electrolytes being included in a neutral, buffered solution having a relatively large volume.

<DESCRIPTION>
 COMPOSITION FOR IRRIGATING INTRAOCULAR TISSUESAND MAINTAINING MYDRIASIS DURING INTRAOCULAR SURGERYCross Reference to Related Application(s):The present application is a continuation-in-part of United States Patent Application Serial No. 07/964,327 filed October 21, 1992.Background of Invention: 1. Field of the InventionThe present invention relates to the field of intraocular surgery. More particularly, the invention relates to a solution which performs the dual functions of: (1) maintaining mydriasis, and (2) maintaining the integrity, stability, and function of ocular tissues, during invasive intraocular surgical procedures. 2. Discussion of Related ArtThe growth of new surgical techniques and associated products over the past decade has been quite remarkable. For example, cataract surgery, which is a very delicate operation involving replacement of the natural crystallin lens of the human eye with an artificial lens, was previously considered to be a major surgical procedure requiring hospitalization of the patient and a significant recovery period, but today this procedure is routinely performed on an out-patient basis and enables vision to be restored almost immediately. Similar advancements have been achieved in other areas of ophthalmic surgery. These remarkable advancements are attributable to various factors, including improved equipment for performing the surgeries, improved surgical techniques developed by innovative surgeons, and improved pharmaceutical products which facilitate successful surgery by minimizing the risks of damaging sensitive, irreplaceable ocular tissue during surgery. The present invention is directed to a further improvement in one such 

 pharmaceutical product, a solution for irrigating ocular tissue during intraocular surgery. Such solutions are discussed in United States Patent No. 4,550,022; the entire contents of that patent are hereby incorporated in the present specification by reference. The importance of such solutions to ophthalmic medicine is explained in the '022 patent. The relevant portions of that explanation are repeated below.Any scission into the human body is detrimental to the human body and invariably results in cell loss. The need to keep cell loss to a minimum is particularly crucial during any surgical procedure performed on delicate and irreplaceable tissues, such as the tissues of the eye, nerves, etc. The cornea of the eye is comprised of five layers: epithelium, Bowman's membrane, stroma, Decemet's membrane, and endothelium. The endothelium

<CLAIMS>
 What is Claimed is:
1. A sterile, preservative-free ophthalmic pharmaceutical composition for maintaining mydriasis and irrigating intraocular tissues during intraocular surgical procedures, said composition comprising a first part and a second part, said first part comprising an acidic composition containing a mydriatic agent in an amount sufficient to maintain mydriasis, and said second part comprising a solution which comprises a buffer to provide an ophthalmically acceptable pH when said first part and said second part are combined .
2. A pharmaceutical composition according to Claim 1, wherein the pH of the first part is 3 to 5, and the pH of a solution resulting from the mixing of said first part and said second part is 6.8 to 8.0.
3. A pharmaceutical composition according to Claim 2, wherein the mydriatic agent is a catecholamine.
4. A pharmaceutical composition according to Claim 3, wherein the catecholamine is selected from the group consisting of epinephrine, dipivalyl epinephrine, norepinephrine, phenylephrine and isoproterenol.
5. A pharmaceutical composition according to Claim 4, wherein the catecholamine comprises epinephrine.
6. A pharmaceutical composition according to Claim 2, wherein the composition comprises one or more electrolytes in an amount sufficient to facilitate the maintenance of normal cellular function during an intraocular surgical procedure.
7. A pharmaceutical composition according to Claim 6, wherein the first part further comprises glutathione in an amount sufficient to facilitate the maintenance of normal cellular function during an intraocular surgical procedure. 


 8. A pharmaceutical composition according to Claim 7, wherein the glutathione consists essentially of oxidized glutathione.
9. A pharmaceutical composition according to Claim 8, wherein the concentration of the mydriatic agent in a solution formed by mixing the first part and the second part is 0.0005 to 0.11 mM/l.
10. A pharmaceutical composition according to Claim 9, wherein following mixing of the first part and the second part the composition comprises 0.1 to 5 mM/l calcium, 0.1 to 10 mM/l magnesium, 50 to 500 mM l sodium, 1 to 10 mM/l potassium, 50 to 500 mM/l chloride, 0.1 to 5 mM l phosphate, 1 to 50 mM l bicarbonate, 1 to 25 mM l dextrose and 0.01 to 3 mM l oxidized glutathione.
