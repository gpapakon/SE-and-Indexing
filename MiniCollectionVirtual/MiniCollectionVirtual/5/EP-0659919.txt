<ABSTRACT>
In a weft-thread brake (2) for an air-jet weaving machine, a controllable drive means (23, 25) is provided for at least one thread-guide element (20, 21) causing a deflection of the thread, there being provided between the drive means and the thread-guide element a transmission means (24) which allows a relative movement.

Weft brake (2) for a weaving machine, which can be 
applied between a thread-store means (3) and a feed means 

(4) and which includes at least one thread guide element 
(20, 21; 41), which guides a weft (3) round and is movable 

through use of a drive means (23, 25; 42, 43), characterised 
in that, between the drive means (23, 25; 42, 43) and the at 

least one thread guiding element (20, 21: 41), there is at 
least one transmission means (24, 37, 39, 46, 49) which 

transmits movement of the drive means (23, 25; 42, 43) a 
said transmission means enabling relative movement between 

a said drive means and said thread guiding element. 
Weft brake in accordance with claim 1, characterised in 
that a rotating drive (23) with a drive shaft (25) is 

provided as the drive means which is connected to the at 
least one movably, coaxially disposed thread-guiding element 

(20, 21), by a transmission means (24, 37, 39, 49). 
Weft brake in accordance with claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that one holding means (22) is provided, 

for at least one thread-guiding element (20, 21), which is 
rotatably supported on a drive shaft (25) and is connected 

to this latter by means of a transmission means (24, 37, 49) 
which enables relative movement in a peripheral direction 

between a said drive shaft and a said holding means. 
Weft brake in accordance with any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that a spring-elastic transmission means 

(24, 37, 39, 46) is provided between a drive means (23, 25: 
42, 43) and at least one thread-guiding element (20, 21; 

41).  
 
Weft brake in accordance with claim 4, characterized in 
that a spirally wound spring (24) is provided between a 

drive shaft (25) and at least one thread-guiding element 
(20, 21). 
Weft brake in accordance with any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that magnetic transmission means (49) are 

disposed between a drive means (23, 25) and at least one 
thread-guiding element (20, 21). 
Weft brake in accordance with claim 6, characterized in 
that a holding means (33) which is fixed, in terms of 

rotation, to a drive shaft (25), and a holding means (22) 
which carries at least one thread-guiding element (20, 21) 

and can rotate on a said drive shaft (25), are provided, 
said holding means being provided with opposing permanent 

magnets (50, 51, 52, 53).
