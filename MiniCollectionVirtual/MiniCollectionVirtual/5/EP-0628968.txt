<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a radiation 
shielding material for simultaneously shielding gamma-rays, 
X-rays and neutron rays. More particularly, it 
relates to a radiation shielding material for radiation 
facilities, for containers for storing and transporting 
radioactive wastes, nuclear fuels, radioisotope (RI) 
and the like, and for associated apparatuses and 
appliances. As to shielding of gamma-rays and X-rays among 
radiations, any materials do not make a great 
difference therebetween in a mass attenuation 
coefficient, and because a material having a high 
density has a large linear attenuation coefficient and 
it can be used in a less thickness as a shielding body, 
lead, iron, concrete, etc., have been generally used as 
shielding materials. To shield neutron rays, there have been mainly 
used high-molecular materials such as polyethylene, 
paraffin, boron-mixed epoxy resins and materials 
containing large quantities of hydrogen such as water.  
 
Since concrete also contains hydrogen, it is used as a 
structural material additionally serving as a shield. To shield the neutron rays, hydrogen is 
extremely important. Fast neutrons irradiated into a 
material will lose their energy due to elastic 
scattering with hydrogen atom therein and turn into 
thermal neutron rays, which are then captured by atomic 
nuclei of hydrogen and other elements. The thermal 
neutron rays are more easily captured by atomic nuclei 
having greater thermal neutron capture cross section. 
But there are some cases where secondary gamma-rays are 
emitted in this case, and therefore, shield against the 
secondary gamma-rays must be taken into consideration 
when neutron rays are attempted to be shielded. Accordingly, in a case where neutron rays are 
shielded or neutron rays and gamma- and X-rays are 
simultaneously shielded, a material such as 
polyethylene, paraffin or water for shielding neutron 
rays, and a material such as lead or iron for shielding 
gamma-rays have heretofore been used in combination 
by laminating these two kinds of materials. Therefore, 
radiation facilities, containers for storing and 
transporting radioactive wastes, nuclear fuels, RIs and 
the like, and associated apparatuses and appliances, 
which are particularly accompanied with the emission of 
neutron rays, are constructed or fabricated from 
concrete, lead or iron each having a high density, and,  
 
furthermore, a shielding body is prepared from 
polyethylene, paraffin or water which is quite 
different as a shielding material from the
