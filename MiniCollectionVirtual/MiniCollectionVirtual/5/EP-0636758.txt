<ABSTRACT>
The platform travels in the vertical and horizontal directions, the gear forming a rotary supporting surface from the building wall. Its surface consists of rollers (9) turning freely on axes tangential to its direction of rotation. The running gear can be mounted on the platform so as to turn in two opposite directions, having a disc-type hub rotating on a shaft and with outwards-protruding supporting segments, between which the roller-spindles are mounted. Clamping screws for the spindles can be provided in the segments. The hub shaft can be coupled to a driving motor on the platform.
