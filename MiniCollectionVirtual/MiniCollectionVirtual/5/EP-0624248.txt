<DESCRIPTION>
This is a Continuation-In-Part application of
US-A-5213669, "Capillary
Column Continuing a Dynamically Crosslinked Composition
and Method of Use", filed on January 31, 1992 by Andras
Guttman. This application is related to United States
Patent No. 5,098,539, "Gel Containing Microcapillary
Columns", issued on March 24, 1992 to Chia-Hui Shieh, EP-A-510824, and EP-A-497448.The present invention is directed to the
analysis of samples in general and in particular to the
analysis of sample constituents using capillary
electrophoretic techniques. In a preferred embodiment,
the invention is directed to a capillary column
comprising a bifunctional agent gel composition
hydrophilic polymer layer, and removable separation
compositions. Preferred embodiments of the removable
separation composition include dynamically crosslinked
compositions particularly suited for the analysis of,
inter alia surfactant:proteinaceous material complexes, 
denaturing compositions particularly suited for, inter
alia sequencing analysis of single and double-stranded
nucleic acids, and buffer solutions for the "open tube"
analysis of samples.Capillary electrophoresis is one of the most
widely used separation techniques in the biologically-related
sciences. Capillary electrophoresis is a
technique which permits rapid and efficient separations
of charged substances. In general, capillary
electrophoresis involves introduction of a sample into a
capillary tube, and the application of an electric field
to the tube. The electric potential of the field both
pulls the sample through the tube and separates it into
its constituent parts, or separates the components of the
sample based upon the relative sizes of those components.
An on-line detector can be used to continuously monitor
the separation and provide data as to the various
constituents. Capillary electrophoresis can be generally
separated into two categories based upon the separating
medium, these being "open tube" and "gel" capillary
electrophoresis.In "open tube" capillary electrophoresis, the
capillary tube is filled with an electrically conductive
buffer solution. Upon ionization of the capillary, the
negatively charged inner wall will attract a layer of
positive ions from the buffer. As these ions flow
towards the cathode, under the influence of the
electrical potential, the bulk solution (i.e., the buffer
solution and the sample being analyzed), must also flow
in this direction to maintain electroneutrality. This
electroendosmotic flow provides a fixed velocity
component which
