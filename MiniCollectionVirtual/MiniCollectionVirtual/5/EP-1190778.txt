<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and an apparatus for handling
toasted slices (2) on their way to packaging, in particular for rejecting,

automatically on a continual basis, faulty toasted slices (3) from rows of
toasted slices (2) being conveyed, continually in a side-by-side

relationship, to packaging, wherein a routed stream of a plurality of
rows of toasted slices proceeding beside one another and including

regular (2) as well as faulty (3) slices are fed forward continually along a
predetermined direction of advance. The method comprises starting

each row of toasted slices (2,3) of said continual stream onto a
respective flexible conveyor (6a) driven along a path of travel in said

direction (A) of advance and formed with an abutment edge (11) along at
least one side thereof. Down the path, the flexible conveyor (6a) is

applied a first deflection about a parallel axis x-x to said direction (A) of
advance so as to bring it, in a continuous and gradual manner, to a

slanted position toward the side with the abutment edge (11) set on the
square, into a substantially sub-vertical slant setting wherein only the

centers (G) of gravity of the faulty slices (3) lie outside the edge (11),
thereby causing these slices (3) to drop out of the conveyor (6a) while

the regular slices (2) are retained on the conveyor (6a) by the abutment
edge.
 
Further downstream, the conveyor (6a) is applied a second continuous
and gradual deflection about the axis x-x, in the opposite direction from

the first deflection and through a second path segment, so as to restore
it to a substantially horizontal position.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention broadly relates to a method of handling toasted bread
slices on their way to packaging, that is over that segment of the slice
processing line which lies between the slice toasting oven and the
toasted slice packaging station.In particular, the invention relates to a method for automatically
rejecting, on a continual basis, faulty toasted slices from rows of toasted
slices which are being conveyed, continually in a side-by-side
relationship, to the packaging station, wherein a routed stream of a
plurality of rows of toasted slices, proceeding beside one another and
including regular as well as faulty slices, are fed forward continually
along a predetermined direction of advance.The invention also relates to an apparatus implementing this method.The expression "faulty toasted slices" is used throughout this
specification and the appended claims to indicate slices which either
exit a respective toasting oven in a devious setting from the layout of
parallel rows in which they went through the oven, or depart from the
traditional flattened shape of regular toasted slices, e.g. show a concave
or a convex shape relative to the conveyor surface, or cling together in
partially or fully overlapping pairs.As is known, toasted slices leave a continuous toasting oven arrayed on
a belt conveyor in more or less straight parallel rows and substantially
tight courses, and are fed -- in this which is the layout that they
maintained while going through the oven -- to a channeled chute which
slopes down in the direction of advance of the slices, for delivery of the
slices by gravity onto a transport system, itself a channeled one. This
transport system provides to send the toasted slices, still in parallel
rows, to one or more packaging stations. The above channeled transport system comprises basically a plurality of
parallel belt sub-conveyors (one per each row of slices) held apart by a
corresponding plurality of flat bars which are laid edgewise, span the
length of the sub-conveyors in the direction of advance of the slices, and
are supported on the transport system stationary frame.It is a recognized fact that not all the slices would come out of the
toasting oven in a desired shape and texture, that is, in the
substantially flat rectangular shape they had when cut off their parent
cake. In fact, a substantial proportion of the slices may exhibit faults, in
the form of slices partially overlapping each other in pairs, or of
distorted, misaligned, cracked slices, or else. Faulty slices can easily
create

A method of handling toasted slices (2, 3) on their way to packaging
for rejecting, automatically on a continual basis, faulty

toasted slices (3) from rows of toasted slices (2, 3) being conveyed,
continually in a side-by-side relationship, to packaging, wherein a

routed stream of a plurality of rows of toasted slices proceeding beside
one another and including regular slices (2) as well as faulty slices (3)

are fed forward continually along a predetermined direction of advance,
comprising the following steps:


starting each row of toasted slices (2,3) of said continual stream onto a slice-carrying working run (6a)
of a respective flexible endless belt conveyor (6) driven along a path of travel in said

direction A of advance and formed with an abutment edge (11) set on the square along at
least one side thereof;
subjecting said slice-carrying working run (6a) to a first deflection about a
parallel axis (x-x) to said direction A of advance and through a first

segment of its respective path of travel, so as to bring it, in a continuous
and gradual manner, to a slanted position toward said abutment edge

(11), into a substantially sub-vertical slant setting
wherein only the centers of gravity of the faulty slices (3) lie outside said

edge (11), thereby causing said slices (3) to drop out of said conveyor
(6a) while the regular slices (2) are retained on said slice-carrying working run (6a) by the

abutment edge itself;
subjecting said slice-carrying working run (6a) to a second gradual and continuous
deflection about said axis (x-x) in the opposite direction from said first

deflection, and through a second segment of said path of travel
extending downstream of said sub-vertical slanted position, to restore it

to a substantially horizontal position.
A method according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 said sub-vertical
position setting is at least 80째.
A method according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 said axis (x-x)
belongs to the conveyor (6). 
An apparatus (1) for automatically singling out and rejecting
faulty toasted slices (3) from parallel rows of slices (2, 3) driven continually

along a predetemined direction of advance toward a packaging station,
which apparatus comprises a plurality of flexible endless

belt conveyors (6) having a slice-carrying working run (6a) which extends along a
substantially horizontal path of travel, said conveyors (6) being

provided with an abutment edge (11) set on the

(6a) lying, at least through a segment of said path of travel, in a sub-vertical
position slanted toward said side formed with the abutment

edge (11), and means (29,34) being provided for holding and guiding each
slice-carrying run (6a) along said segment of the path of travel in a

slanted position setting.

 said
slant angle is approximately 80째 to the horizontal.
An apparatus according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that

advance and formed with abutment edges (11).
An apparatus according to Claim 6, 
characterized in that
 said
tracks have an inclination angle of about 80째.
An apparatus according to Claim 6, 
characterized in that
 said
tracks are supported, at approximately halfway the travel path, on a

bridge-like crosspiece extended on the plurality of said slice-carrying
working runs (6a).
An apparatus according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that
 said
means further comprises second and third pluralities of plate-like

tracks (29,37) supporting said slice-carrying working runs (6a)

characterized in that
 said
tracks are identical with those of the first plurality and set at an

inclination angle of about 30째 to the horizontal.
