<ABSTRACT>
In a paper ejection device for a stencil printing 
device provided with a lifting member for producing a 

curvature in each sheet of ejected printing paper as 
seen in a cross section perpendicular to the direction 

of paper ejection, the lifting member is allowed to 
move at least between a first position which is 

relatively retracted from the paper ejection passage 
and a second position which relatively protrudes into 

the paper ejection passage. The movement of the 
lifting member may be effected according to the size or 

the kind of the printing paper or depending on whether 
a sorter is connected to the printer or not. Thus, an 

appropriate curvature can be given to the ejected 
printing paper without requiring any manual work by the 

user. Thus, a satisfactory paper ejecting operation 
can be ensured at all times without requiring any 

manual work by the operator of the stencil printing 
device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a paper ejection 
device for a stencil printing device, and in particular 
to a paper ejection device provided with a means for 
producing a curvature in each ejected printing paper as 
seen in a cross section perpendicular to the direction 
of paper ejection. In the conventional stencil printing device, 
printed printing paper is ejected from a printing unit, 
and is stacked up on a paper ejection table provided in 
a terminal end of a paper ejection passage, with its 
printed face up. If the leading edge of the printing paper droops 
down as the paper sheet is conveyed to the paper 
ejection table, the leading edge of the printed 
printing paper may slide over the upper surface or the 
printed surface of the paper sheet previously stacked 
up on the paper ejection table, and this will smear the 
printed image of the printed printing paper previously 
placed on the paper ejection table. Therefore, it is 
proposed, for instance, in Japanese patent publication 
(kokoku) No.58-46428, Japanese utility model laid open 
publication (kokai) No. 60-165347 and Japanese patent 
laid open publication (kokai) No. 61-217461, to 
increase the apparent rigidity of the printing paper 
along the direction of paper ejection (the longitudinal 
direction) and prevent the leading edge of the printing 
paper from drooping during the process of paper 
ejection by providing a lifting member in an 
intermediate part of the paper ejection passage leading 
to the paper ejection table and providing a U-shaped or 
W-shaped curvature to the printing paper as seen in the 
cross section perpendicular to the direction of paper  
 
ejection. However, the inventors have realized that the 
effective rigidity of printing paper heavily depends on 
the thickness, material and size of the printing paper, 
and that the curvature that should be given to the 
printing paper for achieving a desired apparent 
rigidity varies a great deal depending on the type and 
size of the printing paper. In particular, it has been 
realized that a fixed lifting member is not adequate in 
ensuring a satisfactory operation of the paper ejection 
device when printing paper of different types and sizes 
is used on the stencil printing device. For instance, the effective rigidity of printing 
paper heavily depends on the size, in particular the 
lateral width of the printing paper, and it is 
therefore desirable to determine the degree of the 
curvature according to the lateral width of the 
printing paper or the dimension of the
