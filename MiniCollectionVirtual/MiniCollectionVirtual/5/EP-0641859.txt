<ABSTRACT>
A method for preparing an immobilized enzyme conjugate, 
whereby the enzyme is treated with a polyfunctional amine 

reactive material for forming a treated enzyme-containing adduct 
before being immobilized on a solid support which has been 

contacted with a solution of a polyamine compound. The method is 
especially preferred for use with glucoamylase, fungal α-amylase 

and β-amylase. Immobilized enzyme conjugates formed by use of 
this method include treated enzyme-containing adducts. The 

immobilized enzyme conjugates disclosed herein are more stable 
and the enzymes immobilized therein are more tightly-held than 

those otherwise obtained and provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for preparing
immobilized enzyme conjugates and to stable, immobilized enzyme
conjugates which are prepared by use of this method, wherein the enzyme is selected from glucoamylase, bacterial α-amylase,
fungal α-amylase, β-amylase and mixtures thereof.Generally, enzymes are water soluble. Thus, when utilized in
a reaction medium without being immobilized on a support (free
enzyme), they are difficult to remove therefrom for reuse. These
difficulties result in increased costs associated with the use of
such enzymes due to the necessity for their frequent replacement.
Moreover, while free (unimmobilized) enzymes can be used efficiently
in batch-type processes, they do not lend themselves to
use in continuous, industrial-scale processes.To reduce the high cost of enzyme replacement, various
methods have been devised for immobilizing enzymes prior to their
use. Such immobilization permits the enzymes to be conviently
removed from the reaction medium for subsequent reuse. These
immobilized enzymes may be employed in various reactor systems,
such as in packed columns and stirred tank reactors, depending on
the nature of the substrate which is being biocatalytically
reacted.Methods proposed for immobilization of an enzyme include the
use of a carrier in the form of a solid support made from inorganic
or organic material. Such materials include, for example,
gamma-alumina, titania, activated granular carbon, granular
diatomaceous earth, glass beads, porous glass, pumice-stone,
silica gel, metal oxide and aluminium oxide. A compound, or a
mixture of compounds, is used to attach the enzyme to this
carrier, with polyethylenimine and glutaraldehyde in particular
being cited. However, such methods can be disadvantageous in that 
the enzyme is not tightly-held (by either being bonded thereto or
being entrapped therein) to the carrier. Thus, the enzyme can
become "detached" (unbonded) from the carrier becoming "free" in
the reaction medium. In fact, the forces which exist between the
enzyme and the carrier so as to hold them together are often
quite weak, such that the enzyme is readily desorbed from the
carrier in the presence of the substrate being processed, and
lost in the reaction medium.United States Letters Patent n° 4,713,333 discloses a
process wherein enzymes are immobilized on granular diatomaceous
earth. That process involves contacting porous granular diatomaceous
earth with a solution of polyethylenimine. Then, the
diatomaceous earth containing the
