<ABSTRACT>
The disclosed method is intended for deriving a quality signal (Vm) from 
a binary read signal (Vl') which read signal comprises bit cells (30) of constant length 

(T). During the reading process, an optical information pattern of optically detectable 
effects (32) is scanned. A 
read signal (Vl) is then generated in which first read signal 
portions that exceed a reference value (Vref) in a first direction correspond to the 

effects in the read-out information pattern. In an analysis circuit (20) a signal is derived 
as a quality signal which is a measure for mutual differences between the length 

deviations (dT) for the read signal portions of different lengths. The quality signal can 
be used for adapting a recording strategy used for the recording of information. The 

quality signal may also be used for setting an equalizing filter. In dependence on the 
quality signal the ratio is then set between the gain factor in a certain frequency range 

in the frequency band of the filter and the gain factor outside said frequency range.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method as recited in the preamble of Claim 1,
and furthermore, to a recording device and to a reading device in which such method is
used.Such method and reading device are known from Research Disclosure;
August 1992, No. 34002, which describes a recording method on the basis of EFM-modulated
signals for use in the Compact Disc. For a reliable recovery of the
information represented by the read signal, it is fundamental for the quality of the read
signal must be good. According to said document the lengths of the first read signal
portions in the signal that is read out must, in essence, have discrete values equal to an
integer number times the bit cell length. According to the known method first read
signal portions corresponding to a small number of bit cells, in this case three, are
selected for deriving a quality signal. Then a signal is derived as the quality signal
which is a measure for the jitter of these selected first read signal portions. If the
quality is unsatisfactory, the recording strategy is adapted, so that the information
pattern and hence also the quality of the read signal is adapted. Recording strategy in
this context is meant to be understood as the relationship between the recording beam
modulation used for the recording, and the information to be recorded. In prior-art
device a recording strategy is used according to which an effect having a length that
corresponds to 3 bit cells (also termed I3 effect) is recorded by a radiation pulse 2 bit
cells in length, the intensity in the last part of the radiation pulse being lower than the
intensity at the beginning of the radiation pulse. Effects representing a larger number of
bit cells are obtained by extending the radiation pulse, the intensity in the extended part
of the radiation pulse being kept low. If an adaptation of the recording strategy is
desired, this adaptation is exclusively effected in the prior-art by adapting the intensity
at the beginning of the radiation pulses.It is an object of the invention to provide a method in which a quality
signal is generated that indicates the quality of the read signal better.Now therefore, according to one of its aspects, the invention is 
characterized according to the characterizing part of Claim 1.Furthermore, US 4,688,204, Figure 6, and GB-A 2 109 187
disclose reading devices that use certain differential techniques for reading out
information signals. However, none of these references intends to derive a quality signal
with respect to earlier optical
