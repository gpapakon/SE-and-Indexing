<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for minimizing the effect 
of lateral velocity transients upon an aircraft 

inertial instrument calibration process of the type in 
which cross-track velocity is measured and utilized to 

correct for the east component of gyro bias error. A 
"cross-track position" value is obtained by integration 

of the cross-track velocity. A Kalman filter 22 
calculates a plurality of gain values corresponding to 

measurements of crab angle, lever arm, north and east 
velocity, heading angle and rate of change of heading 

angle and those gain values are applied to the cross-track 
position value to obtain error values for each of 

such parameters. The calculated error values are then 
employed as corrections to, or calibrations of, the 

inertial instrument outputs.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus 
and method for calibrating the strapdown inertial 
navigation system of a taxiing aircraft. Aircraft inertial navigation relies upon the 
integration of data throughout a sequence that is begun 
when the aircraft is prepared for takeoff and which ends 
when the aircraft has landed and motion has ceased. The 
inertial navigation apparatus of an aircraft includes 
various components, including accelerometers and 
gyroscopes, that convert the effects of inertial forces 
into acceleration, velocity and position measurements. 
The accelerometers determine acceleration forces along  
 
three orthogonal sensitive axes and this data is 
converted, through integrations, into the aircraft's 
velocity and position. In a strapdown system in which the 
accelerometers are fixed in relation to the geometry of 
the aircraft, the gyroscopes that measure the aircraft's 
attitude also measure that of the accelerometer platforms. 
The data measured by the gyros is utilized to resolve the 
accelerometer outputs continuously along the appropriate 
space axes. The standard inertial instruments are well-suited 
for obtaining the necessary flight data in an 
aircraft when airborne. However, important calibration 
processes take place at the beginning of the flight and 
prior to the airborne phase to assure that the ultimate 
measurements of acceleration, velocity and position are 
substantially free of inaccuracy and bias. Thus, during 
initial alignment, the precise location and the attitudes 
of the inertial navigation instruments must be determined 
and entered into the flight computer, a process that 
corresponds to the "leveling of the reference platform" 
that takes place in a non-strapdown or gimballed 
navigation system.  
 After initial instrument alignment, the flight 
computer enters the navigation mode and remains in this 
mode for the remainder of the flight. While in the 
navigation mode, the flight computer receives information 
from the accelerometers and keeps track of the attitudes 
of the inertial instruments by means of the gyros. Such 
attitude information is received from the integration of 
the rate signals received from the gyroscopes. The initial alignment mode also serves as an 
opportunity to correct instrument errors. An important 
error of this sort is the body component of gyro bias 
error. This error refers to the fixed offset or bias of 
the angular rate output of the gyros along the aircraft's 
pitch and roll axes. Unfortunately, in the prior art it
