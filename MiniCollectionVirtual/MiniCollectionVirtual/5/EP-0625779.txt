<ABSTRACT>
A focus drive coil is wound on an outer periphery of 
a lens holder, and two tracking drive coils are provided on the 

focus drive coil. Magnetic chips are preferably interposed 
between each of the two tracking drive coils. First to third 

magnets are provided on an actuator base. The first magnet 
faces the adjacent half portions of the two tracking drive coils, 

and the second and third magnets face the outer half portion of 
the two tracking drive coils. The lens holder is supported 

on the actuator base by using upper and lower parallel triangular 
plate springs.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an actuator for an optical
head, and more particularly, to an actuator for an objective lens
controlled to move in focus and tracking directions with high
resolution and high precision.An optical disc apparatus for the next generation is
required to operate with a large capacity of information and
high information transfer rate. For this purpose, an
objective lens for high resolution recording is used for an
optical head, and is required to be controlled with a high speed
and high precision. Therefore, an objective lens
actuator to be moved in focus and track directions must be small
in size and light in weight, and must generate a driving force.A first conventional actuator for an optical head
comprises a lens holder which holds an objective lens, a focus
drive coil provided around an outer periphery of the lens holder,
tracking drive coils which are flat to be provided on the focus
drive coil, an actuator base having a shaft for supporting the
lens holder to be moved along the shaft and rotated around the
shaft, a pair of magnets provided on opposite sides of the shaft
on the actuator base, and a damper spring provided on the
actuator base to resiliently energize the lens holder positioning
the neutral position by engaging with the lens holder, as
disclosed in the JP-A-1-178134. In operation, driving adjusting current in tracking
direction flows in a direction through the tracking drive coils,
so that a tracking adjusting magnetic field is generated to link
with a magnetic field of the magnets. As a result, the lens
holder is rotated against the force of the damper spring around
the shaft on the actuator base in a direction determined by the
direction of the tracking driving current.On the other hand, a focus adjusting current flows in
a direction through the focus drive coil, so that a focus
adjusting magnetic field is generated to link with the magnetic
field of the magnets. As a result, the lens holder is moved
up and down in direction, against the rebound force of the damper
spring dependent on the direction of the focus adjusting current.Thus, the focus and tracking adjustments of the
objective lens are carried out in accordance with focus and
tracking moving forces generated by the magneto-electrical forces
between the generated magnetic flux and the magnetic field.A second conventional actuator for an optical head
comprises a lens holder for holding an objective lens, a pair of
parallel plate springs for resiliently supporting the lens holder
to move in the focus
