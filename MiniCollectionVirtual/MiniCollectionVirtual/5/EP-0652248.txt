<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a modifier for synthetic resins 
and, more particularly, to a modifier capable of conferring lubricity, 
water repellency and releasability on the moldings of synthetic resins. With the intention of modifying the lubricity, water repellency 
and releasability of the surfaces of molded synthetic resins, there 
have so far been proposed the methods of applying waxes, such as 
paraffin, carnauba wax, polyethylene, metal soaps or silicone oils, 
such as dimethylsilicone oil, phenylmethylsilicone oil, to the 
moldings' surfaces; or the methods of adding modifiers as cited above 
to the resin compounds to be molded. Of those modifiers, dimethylsilicone oil has been prevailingly 
used because it is not only especially superior to the others in water, 
repellency and releasability but also has lubricity characteristics 
suitable for synthetic resins and excellent chemical inertness and 
thermal stability. With the prominent features described above, dimethylsilicone oil 
still has drawbacks such that lubricity characteristics thereof proves 
insufficient to moldings according to the end-use purpose of the 
moldings and, in the case where it is added to synthetic resins, the 
effect thereof as modifier has only a short duration because of its poor 
compatibility with synthetic resins. For the purpose of mitigating such drawbacks, there have been 
proposed the compounds for modification use, which have improved 
compatibilities with synthetic resins, in Japanese Tokko Sho 58-50664, 
Japanese Tokkai Sho 56-41256 and Japanese Tokko Hei 2-55459 (the term  
 
"Tokko" as used herein means an "examined patent publication" and the 
term "Tokkai" as used herein means an "unexamined published patent 
application"). In cases where it is required of those compounds to confer heat-resisting 
lubricity and heat-resisting releasability on synthetic-resin 
moldings to which they are added, they fail to produce sufficient 
effect, although they are superior to the aforesaid silicone oil in 
permanence of lubricity, water repellency and releasability because of 
their good compatibilities with synthetic resins. As a reason for such a defect, it can be thought that since those 
compounds for modification use are liquid at ordinary temperature or 
have low melting points even if they are solid at ordinary temperature, 
they gradually ooze out of the moldings' surface as the moldings are 
exposed to the air of a temperature higher than their melting points. In order to solve the above-described
