<ABSTRACT>
A highly-antigenic, recombinant polypeptide of a molecular weight of about 110-kD by SDS-PAGE is disclosed, which is derived by transforming E. coli with a 7.1 kB DNA fragment from EcoR1-digested B. burgdorferi DNA, followed by identification of cloned transformants expressing polypeptides which bind to anti-B. burgdorferi antibodies.

<DESCRIPTION>
 RECOMBINANT VACCINE AGAINST LYME DISEASEBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The genus Borrelia is included in the order Spiro- chaetales ( "spirochetes") and family Spirochaetaceae. Borrelia species are associated with arthropod hosts and often have limited geographical ranges. Lyme borreliosis, a systemic illness with a wide spectrum of clinical symptoms, was named for Lyme, Connecticut, where the disease was recognized and studied in 1975.The illness usually develops 3 to 30 days following the bite of an ixodid tick which transmits Borrelia burgdorferi to humans and animals. The disease in humans often begins with a primary skin lesion called erythema migrans (EM) which may be followed by cardiac, neurologic, or arthritic symptoms. The primary clinical sign in dogs and horses is lameness.Antigenic proteins can be isolated from B. burgdorferi by immunoprecipitation, extraction from SDS polyacrylamide gels, or by molecular cloning and expression. The first two methods require large numbers of organisms, creating a logistical problem with B. burgdorferi, which has a generation time of 8 to 24 hours at 32°C and reaches a maximum cell density of 107 to 108 cells/ml.Molecular cloning of protein antigens in a host such as Escherichia coli can result in their production in large amounts without contamination by other spirochete antigens. Using E_;_ coli as a host for molecular cloning also avoids association of B^ burgdorferi antigens with rabbit serum since the E . coli can be grown in Luria broth (LB) containing no rabbit serum. This is critical in the development of vaccines since spirochetal antigens may adsorb rabbit serum, a component of the medium used to propagate B^ burgdorferi, potentially resulting in anaphylactic shock when administered to animals including humans. 

 Two major surface proteins with molecular weights of 31 kilodalton (-kD) and 34-kD (OspA and OspB, respectively) have been cloned, sequenced, and characterized. See, S. Bergstrom et al., Mol. Microbiol., , 479 (1989). Those two proteins are under the control of a single promoter and are found on a linear plasmid. See, T.R. Howe et al., Infect. Immunol., 54, 207 (1985).The 41-kD protein, a flagellin component, has been cloned, sequenced and found to be recognized early in the immune response by A.G. Barbour et al., J. Clin. Invest., 72, 504 (1983) and R. allech et al., Infect. I mun., 58, 1711 (1990). Unfortunately, human antibodies specific to this flagellin component cross react with other species of Borrelia, thus reducing the specificity

WHAT IS CLAIMED IS;
1. A vaccine comprising an immunogenic amount of an antigenic recombinant polypeptide of about 110-kD molecular weight, as determined under reducing conditions by SDS-PAGE, wherein said polypeptide is combined with a physiologically acceptable, non- toxic liquid vehicle, which amount is effective to immunize a susceptible mammal against Lyme borreliosis, wherein the amino acid sequence of said polypeptide corresponds to the amino acid sequence of the recombinant 110-kD polypeptide produced by E. coli transformant ATCC 68825 which comprises a 75-kD Borrelia burgdorferi polypeptide.
2. The vaccine of claim 1 which further comprises an effective amount of an immunological adjuvant.
3. The vaccine of claim 1 wherein the mammal is a dog, a cat, a llama, a bovine, a sheep, a goat or a horse.
4. The vaccine of claim 1 wherein the mammal is a human.
5. A diagnostic assay for B. burgdorferi infection or for Lyme disease comprising:
(a) contacting a mammalian physiological fluid com¬ prising antibodies against B. burgdorferi, with an immobilized recombinant polypeptide of about
110- kD molecular weight, as determined under reducing conditions by SDS-PAGE, wherein the amino acid sequence of said polypeptide corresponds to the amino acid sequence of the recombinant 110-kD polypeptide produced by E. coli transformant ATCC 68825 which comprises a 75-kD Borrelia burgdorferi polypeptide; to 


 yield a binary complex comprising said antibody and said polypeptide; (b) removing said physiologic fluid from contact with said binary complex; and (c) detecting the presence of said binary complex.
6. The method of claim 5 wherein said binary complex is detected by reacting it with an anti-human immunoglobulin comprising a detectable label or a binding site for a detectable label, to yield a ternary complex, and detecting the presence of said ternary complex.
7. The method of claim 6 wherein the label is an enzyme, and wherein the ternary complex is detected by reacting the enzyme with its substrate.
8. A recombinant polypeptide of about 100-kD molecular weight, as determined by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, wherein the amino acid sequence of said polypeptide corresponds to the amino acid sequence of the recombinant 100-kD polypeptide produced by E. coli transformant ATCC 68825 which comprises a 75-kD Borrelia burgdorferi polypeptide.
9. An essentially pure Borrelia burgdorferi polypeptide of about 75-kD molecular weight, as determined by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, which is recognized by monospecific antisera against the recombinant 100-kD polypeptide produced by 12. coli transformant ATCC 68825.
10. A DNA sequence of about 7.1 kilobases which encodes a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence which corresponds essentially to the amino acid sequence of the recombinant 110-kD Borrelia burgdorferi 


 polypeptide produced by E. coli transformant ATCC 68825.
