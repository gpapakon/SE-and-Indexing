<ABSTRACT>
Within a sub-code to be recorded in a recording medium, the physical characteristics of the recording medium are recorded. This enables a recording apparatus or a reading apparatus to easily and correctly determine the physical characteristics of the recording medium by reading the subcode. The physical characteristic information includes information concerning the material, the disc type, the linear velocity, the track pitch, the moment of inertia, and the size/configuration of the recording medium. It is thus possible to easily and correctly determine the physical characteristics of the disc (or unit area) while maintaining the compatibility with known recording media.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a recording medium,
and also to a recording apparatus and a reading apparatus
compatible with such a recording medium.As a recording medium, a compact disc (CD) is known.
Various types of CD-format discs, such as compact disc
digital audio (CD-DA), compact disc read only memory (CD-ROM),
compact disc recordable (CD-R), compact disc
rewritable (CD-RW), and CD-TEXT, all of which belong to the
so-called "CD family", have been developed and are commonly
used.The CD-DA and CD-ROM are read only, while the CD-R is a
write-once medium using an organic pigment on a recording
layer, and the CD-RW is a rewritable medium using a phase
change technique.On such CD-format discs, data, such as music, video,
and computer data, are recorded, and also, track numbers,
indexes, and addresses are recorded as sub-codes.The track number is a number representing a piece of
music (track). The indexes are units which form a track,
for example, units which partition the movements of a track. The addresses include absolute addresses represented by
consecutive values covering the whole disc and relative
addresses represented in units of tracks (which are also
referred to as "programs" represented in units of pieces of
music). Accordingly, by extracting sub-codes, the absolute
address and the relative address at each position of a disc
can be identified.The address is represented by a time value, such as
minute/second/frame. Thus, in the CD format, the "time" can
be synonymous with the "position (address)", for example,
the "absolute time" corresponds to the "absolute address".For example, in the CD format, the sub-code address is
represented by minute/second/frame, each having eight bits.
Since the eight-bit address is represented in binary coded
decimal (BCD), it can express a range from 0 to 99.
Accordingly, the "minute" can be designated from 0 to 99
minutes. However, the "second" is inevitably expressed from
0 to 59, and the "frame" is expressed from 0 to 74 since 75
frames, such as frame 0 to frame 74 are defined in the CD
format.On the innermost portion of a disc, sub-code
information, such as table-of-content (TOC) information, is
recorded. The TOC information indicates an address
representing the head and the extent of each track. The
content of the address (type of address) can be identified 
by point information.For example, if the point information designates a
special value, the information described in the
corresponding sub-code frame indicates the start address of
each track or the
