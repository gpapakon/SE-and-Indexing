<ABSTRACT>
An array of hollow cathodes can be made by mounting a housing (10) 
connected to 

a source of plasma precursor gas and to a source of power (18) 
in a vacuum 

chamber (20), said housing having a plurality of uniformly 
spaced openings (14) in a wall (12) 

thereof into which a plasma can be generated. A substrate (22) to be 
treated is 

mounted parallel to and spaced a preselected distance from said openings. In 

operation, a plurality of plasma torches is created extending from the openings 
which can plasma etch and remove coatings on said substrate.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel hollow cathode array. More particularly, this 
invention relates to a hollow cathode array for generating a plasma and to a 
method of treating substrate surfaces therewith. Metal sheet stock, such as cold rolled or stainless steel or other iron stock or 
alloys, aluminium and aluminium alloy foil and sheet, copper and copper alloy 
foil and sheet and the like, is rolled to a thin gauge using oil as a pressure 
transfer medium ("rolling oil"). Metals subject to oxidation upon exposure to 
oxygen and moisture in the atmosphere are often protected from oxidation 
during storage by additional oils, greases and other hydrocarbon coatings 
("shipping oils"). However, these coatings must be removed prior to application 
of more permanent coatings such as paint, chromium and the like. Sheet steel that has been coated with organic materials including hydrocarbons 
can be cleaned by immersing in a solvent cleaner, such as perchloroethylene, 
but such solvents are increasingly difficult and expensive to dispose of safely. Removal can also be done by plasma cleaning, but this is generally expensive 
and large sheet cannot be accommodated in conventional plasma etch 
equipment at practicable rates. Thus a practical method of cleaning sheet metal stock to remove organics and 
other coatings rapidly and inexpensively with a plasma continues to be sought. We have found that a hollow cathode array can be made and is a plasma source 
that is useful to treat the surface of various materials including sheet metal 
stock. The hollow cathode array system useful herein comprises a housing having a 
plurality of uniformly spaced openings along one wall thereof, the size of the 
openings and the thickness of the housing wall chosen so that a plasma can be 
generated in and emitted from said openings, in effect obtaining an array of 
hollow cathodes. The hollow cathode array is mounted inside a vacuum  
 
chamber. A substrate to be treated is mounted parallel to the hollow cathode 
array openings at a preselected distance therefrom. Magnetic enhancement can be used to focus the plasma as it exits the openings 
by placing a magnet assembly beneath or above the substrate. Alternatively, a 
magnet assembly of opposite polarity can be placed both beneath the substrate 
and above the housing. The hollow cathode array of the invention can be used to clean sheet material 
by passing the sheet stock beneath the hollow cathode array while passing a 
suitable plasma precursor gas into the housing which
