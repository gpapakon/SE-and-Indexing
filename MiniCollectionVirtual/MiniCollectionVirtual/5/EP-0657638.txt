<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a device that controls the 
injection start time of a fuel injection pump which, when the timing 

control valve drive duty ratio shifts toward the most delayed angle 
side (0%) as the engine rotation slows down and the timing piston 

position has reached the most delayed angle position before the duty 
ratio reaches 0%, fixes the duty ratio at the value at the time 

point at which the timing piston position has reached the most delayed 
angle position. Or, it stores in memory the value at the time 

point at which the timing piston position had reached the most 
delayed angle position and sets the duty ratio at 0%. If the engine 

rotation rate increases suddenly, it shifts the duty ratio from the 
duty ratio at which the timing piston has reached the most delayed 

angle position so that the actual timing piston position immediateiy 
follows the target timing piston position. It correctly processes 

the deviation between the timing piston position and the duty ratio 
when the rotation rate is low, thus reducing the tendency toward 

trailing delay in the injection timing when the engine rotation rate 
increases from low speed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an injection timing apparatus
for an electronic fuel injection system that controls the injection
start time for a fuel injection pump.An example of a fuel injection pump for which the timing apparatus
that determines the fuel injection timing is controled with a
timing control valve, is disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent
Publication S59-105942. This apparatus is provided with processing
through which a decision is made as to whether or not the engine is
in the idling state and when the engine is determined to be in the
idling state, the duty ratio is set to 0% (100% with a valve that
becomes open when a control pulse is at HI) so that the timing
control valve will be fully opened to set the fuel injection timing
at the most delayed angle.In this manner, the timing piston is fixed at the position where
the fuel injection timing is at the most delayed angle (0mm) during
idling. However, as is clear from the characteristics diagram shown
in Figure 6, if the rotation rate of the engine is low, as it is in
this case, even when the timing piston position is at 0mm, the drive
duty ratio of the timing control valve may be larger than 0%. In the
figure, the timing piston position is at 0mm, while the duty ratio
is approximately 30% or lower. However, even when the timing piston is at the Omm position, the
control unit may recognize the timing piston position as being
larger than Omm due to, for example, inconsistency in the mounting
position of a sensor which recognizes the timing piston position (a
timing piston sensor, for instance) or vibration of the sensor. In
such a situation, the trailing delay in the injection timing
presents a problem.In other words, when the target timing piston position is at 0mm
and the engine rotation rate becomes gradually reduced toward the
idling state, the actual timing piston position is at Omm with the
duty ratio at approximately 30%. In this situation, if the control
unit recognizes the actual timing piston position as larger than
Omm, the duty ratio becomes further reduced toward 0% as shown in
Figure 7, in a control such as PID control, in which the timing
piston position converges toward the target position. Because of
this, if the engine rotation rate is suddenly increased from the
idling state, a dead zone occurs, in which the timing piston position
does not change until the duty ratio reaches 30%, and a delay
(T delay) in advancing the injection timing results.Therefore, the object of the present invention is to provide an
injection
