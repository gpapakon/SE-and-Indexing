<ABSTRACT>
In a cremation furnace with electrical heating, a main combustion space formed in the furnace vault, and a secondary combustion space, the heating elements are designed as prefabricated, interchangeable heaters. They lie in heating passages (14), provided for this, in the supporting structure of the furnace vault in shaped bricks (13). The heating passages (14) are open only on one side of the furnace. The return conductor of each heater lies in the same heating passage as the heater itself. It is especially advantageous if the feed and return conductor is designed as a bifilar coil (15d, 15e). This results in a simplified furnace construction, longer service life of the heaters, and the possibility of changing the heaters even when the furnace is hot.
