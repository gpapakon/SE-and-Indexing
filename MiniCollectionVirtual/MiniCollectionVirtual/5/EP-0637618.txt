<ABSTRACT>
An adhesive tape or an adhesive label each of which 

comprises a substrate including a biodegradable polymer 
layer and an adhesive layer provided on at least one 

surface of the substrate. The adhesive tape has a release 
agent layer formed on an opposite surface to the surface 

where the adhesive layer is provided, or has a release tape 
which is in contact with the adhesive layer, and the 

adhesive tape is wound up around a core for storage. The 
adhesive label has a release sheet which is in contact with 

the adhesive layer. In such biodegradable adhesive tape 
and biodegradable adhesive labels, a biodegradable polymer 

is used as a material of the substrate, and therefore 
disruption of the natural environment or of the 

ecosystem in the soil is minimised even when the tape 
and label are discarded in the soil after use.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an adhesive tape and 
an adhesive label each of which comprises a substrate in 
the form of a tape, a film or the like and an adhesive 
layer provided on said substrate. More particularly, the 
invention relates to a biodegradable adhesive tape and a 
biodegradable adhesive label each of which can be degraded 
by microbes when discarded in the soil so as not to exert 
bad influence on the natural environment. Adhesive tapes and adhesive labels each of which 
comprises a substrate in the form of a tape, a film, etc. 
and an adhesive layer formed on the substrate are 
conventionally known. Examples of the adhesive tapes include a single-sided 
adhesive tape comprising a release agent layer formed on one 
surface of an adhesive tape substrate and an adhesive layer 
formed on the other surface of the substrate; and a double-sided 
adhesive tape comprising a double-sided adhesive tape 
main body which has an adhesive tape substrate bearing 
adhesive layers on both surfaces thereof and a double-sided 
release tape having a release tape substrate bearing  
 
release agent layers on both surfaces thereof, which 
adheres to one of the surfaces of the adhesive tape main 
body. The adhesive tapes are stored or on the market as 
rolls formed by winding those tapes around a paper core or 
a plastic core. In the case of the single-sided adhesive 
tape, the adhesive tape itself is rolled up via its release 
agent layer so that the adhesive layers are not directly 
brought into contact with each other. In the case of the 
double-sided tape, the double-sided adhesive tape main body 
is rolled up via the release tape so that the adhesive 
layers are not directly brought into contact with each 
other. Examples of the adhesive labels include an adhesive 
label which comprises an adhesive label main body having an 
adhesive label substrate and an adhesive layer laminated 
thereon and a release sheet having a paper sheet and a 
release agent layer provided thereon, in which the adhesive 
layer of the adhesive label main body is adhered to the 
release agent layer of the release sheet. For the use of the adhesive label of this type, the 
adhesive label main body is released from the release 
sheet. As the substrates of the adhesive tapes and the 
adhesive labels referred to the above, plastic substrates 
have been mainly used conventionally. For the disposal of  
 
the conventional adhesive tapes and adhesive labels after 
use, they are incinerated or buried in the soil. However, such disposal
