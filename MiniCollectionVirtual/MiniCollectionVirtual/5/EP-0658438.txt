<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a method for making an image 
comprising the steps of: 


bringing a dye-layer comprised on the support of a dye donor 
element in face-to-face relationship with an image receiving 

layer comprised on a support of an image receiving element, said 
dye layer consisting of a repeating sequence of at least two dye 

frames each containing a dye dispersed or dissolved in a binder 
and, 
image-wise heating by means of thermal head each of said dye 
frames of said repeating sequence so as to cause image-wise 

transfer of dye from said dye layer to said image receiving 
layer characterised in that:

 
said dye frames contain (a) particle(s) protruding from said dye 

layer, the last dye frame to be image-wise heated from said 
repeating sequence, containing said particle(s) in a reduced 

amount relative to the amount of said particle(s) in any of the 
other dye frames of said repeating sequence or alternatively 

said last dye frame being substantially free of said 
particle(s).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to dye donor elements for use 
according to thermal dye sublimation transfer. More in particular 
the present invention relates to a method and dye donor element for 
obtaining an improved image quality. Thermal dye transfer methods include thermal dye sublimation 
transfer also called dye diffusion thermal transfer. This is a 
recording method in which a dye-donor element provided with a dye 
layer containing sublimating dyes having heat transferability is 
brought into contact with an image receiver sheet and selectively, 
in accordance with a pattern information signal, heated with a 
thermal printing head provided with a plurality of juxtaposed heat-generating 
resistors, whereby dye is transferred from the 
selectively heated regions of the dye-donor element to the image 
receiver sheet and forms a pattern thereon, the shape and density of 
which are in accordance with the pattern and intensity of heat 
applied to the dye-donor element. In order to obtain a full colour 
print, the image receiving sheet is printed three times with a 
yellow, magenta and cyan area of the dye-donor element. Usually, 
the three differently coloured areas are incorporated in one dye-donor 
element by applying subsequently a yellow, a magenta and a 
cyan dye area in separate regions of the dye-donor element. 
Moreover, when high densities of the printed image are required on 
transparencies, printing can be done two or three times with a dye-donor 
element with the same hue, such as mentioned in EP318946 and 
EP522207. This is especially usefull for printing high density 
black and white transparencies. A dye-donor element for use according to thermal dye sublimation 
transfer usually comprises a very thin support e.g. a polyester 
support, one side of which is covered with a dye layer comprising 
the printing dyes in a form that can be released in varying amounts 
depending on how much heat is applied to the dye-donor element. The dye in the dye layer is usually dissolved or dispersed in a 
binder. Known binder resins are cellulose derivatives like ethyl 
cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, ethylhydroxy cellulose,  
 
ethylhydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, methyl 
cellulose, cellulose acetate, cellulose acetate formate, cellulose 
acetate propionate, cellulose acetate butyrate, cellulose acetate 
pentanoate, cellulose acetate hexanoate, cellulose acetate 
heptanoate, cellulose acetate benzoate, cellulose acetate hydrogen 
phthalate, and cellulose triacetate; vinyl-type resins
