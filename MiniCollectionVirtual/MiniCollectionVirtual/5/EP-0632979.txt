<ABSTRACT>
A device for wall-mounting an item of wall furniture comprises: a 
casing (11) to be fixed in an exposed position to the furniture 

item, from this casing there extending a hook which can be 
position-adjusted in terms of height and depth along mutually 

perpendicular planes by respective adjustment means. According to 
the invention, to said casing (11) there can be fitted a cover 

(12) arranged to cover the exposed faces of said casing (11) and 
any spaces between it and the furniture item.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a device for wall-mounting an item of 
wall furniture in which those parts of the casing containing the 
adjustment linkages and fixing means which remain exposed are 
covered by a cover which is freely mountable and removable. Devices for wall-mounting an item of wall furniture are known 
consisting of a casing to be fixed in an exposed position to the 
furniture item, from this casing there extending a hook which can 
be position-adjusted in terms of height and depth along mutually 
perpendicular planes. The hook is intended to be hooked for example to a profiled bar 
fixed to the wall by wall plugs and can be position-adjusted in 
terms of height and depth by respective adjustment means which are 
accessible for example from the opposite side of the casing to 
that from which said hook emerges. A device of this type is described for example in EP 0 033 179. In this type of device the hook comprises a fork fixed to and 
straddling a support block contained in the casing. In other 
types of devices the fork is fixed directly to the casing itself. The means for adjusting the depth of the hook along a horizontal  
 
plane consist of a first screw screwed into a nut loosely secured 
to that end of the fork distant from the hook, whereas the means 
for adjusting the height of the hook along a vertical plane 
consist of a second screw which is screwed through said support 
block to act against one end of a slidable arched sector, the 
opposite end of which acts on the hook fork. Another device of this type, in which the adjustment linkages are 
contained in respective seats in a casing formed in two 
substantially specularly equal halves is described and illustrated 
in utility model application No. MI92U 000898 filed in Italy on 15 
October 1992 in the name of CAMAR S.p.A. As is well known to the expert of the art, mounting devices of the 
aforesaid type have to be fixed to the interior of wall furniture 
items in the corner defined between the side panel and top panel 
of the item. Fixing is by screws or plugs, and it is not always easy to achieve 
the situation in which the top and one side of the casing abut in 
a perfectly coplanar manner against the top panel and side panel 
of the furniture item, sometimes because these latter are not 
assembled at a perfect right angle. This situation is desirable 
in order to achieve a system of good appearance which is pleasing 
to the eye on opening the furniture item. A further drawback of mounting devices of known type in which the

means, characterised in that to said casing (11) there can be 

fitted a cover (12) arranged to cover the exposed faces of said 
casing (11) and any spaces between it and the furniture item. 
A device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that said 
cover (12) is freely removable from the casing (11). 
A device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that said 
cover (12) is completely independent of the casing (11).

cover (12) is formed with a side wall (15), a base wall (16), an 

end wall (17) and an outwardly bent flange (18) opposite the end 
wall (17), the side wall (15) and the base wall (16) comprising 

respective elastically yieldable lips (19, 20) arranged to engage 
in grooves (21, 22) in the casing (11).
