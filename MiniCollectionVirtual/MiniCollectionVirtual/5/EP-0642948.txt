<ABSTRACT>
Seat, in particular for vehicles of local public transportation, in which a joint allows the angle of inclination of the back rest to be adjusted by the manufacturer and also allows folding or fixed seats to be realised, which seat permits the seat and back rest surfaces to have different shapes, it being possible to integrate securing parts easily. The back rest support 4 and seat are connected to each other by just one joint 1 and by sleeves 2; 3, which are associated therewith, a moulding 7 being arranged between the back rest support 4 and sleeve 3, which moulding determines the position of the back rest. Extending through the sleeves 6 of the seat surface support 5 is a tube 8 which is constructed at the same time as a fastening tube and provides a stop 10 for the seat surface support 5. The invention also makes provision for different angles of inclination of the back rest support 4 to be achieved by using different mouldings 7 at the workshop. The seat is primarily suitable for installation in public means of transportation.
