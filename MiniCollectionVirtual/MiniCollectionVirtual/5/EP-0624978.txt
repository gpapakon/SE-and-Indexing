<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus serving as a digital videocassette 
recorder (VCR) for recording analog video and audio signals 

as digital signals. The apparatus serves also as a digital 
data storage drive. The digital VCR and the storage drive 

share common circuitry and a common magnetic recording 
medium. This reduces the cost and enhances the efficiency 

at which tracks are used. The apparatus has a large storage 
capacity. The apparatus divides input digital data into two 

parts and performs error correction encoding for each of 
these two data parts to form sync blocks. These sync blocks 

are recorded in an audio signal recording area and a video 
signal recording area, respectively, on the recording 

medium. Error correction codes used during reading of 
digital data are the same as those used during recording of 

video and audio signals. The same track structure and the 
same sync block structure are used for these two modes of 

operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for
recording and playing back digital data.Analog recording has been heretofore used for video
cassette recorder (VCR). Where images are recorded in
analog form and played back by VCR units, especially when
dubbings are made, the image quality are deteriorated
severely. Therefore, development of VCR utilizing digital
recording has been expected.When an analog VCR unit is in the playback mode,
signals distorted by noises and jitters are directly
delivered from the VCR unit. If an edit, dubbing, or other
operation is performed, distortions are accumulated. As a
result, the playback image quality is deteriorated.
However, in a digital VCR unit, an analog video signal and
analog audio signals are sampled and converted into discrete
quantized digital values, and then these digital values are
recorded. Since the recorded values are discrete values, if 
the amount of noise is sufficiently small, then correctly
recorded digital values can be easily obtained. Where
erroneous digital values are obtained, they can be corrected
by adding error correction codes during reading. In this
way, in digital recording, image quality deterioration due
to dubbing or the like can be suppressed greatly.On the other hand, when an NTSC(the National Television
Systems Comitee) signal that is broadcast by TV is
digitized, the amount of data is increased, because when
analog values are used, information at one point is
expressed by one analog value, whereas when digital values
are used, the same information is represented by plural data
items. Therefore, use of digital VCR units is mostly
restricted to broadcast applications.In recent years, however, as the technique for
compressing image information has evolved, it has become
possible to compress video signals such that the amount of
data is reduced by a factor expressed by one or two digits.
Consequently, a consumer digital VCR unit which provides
higher image quality and suffers from less image quality
deterioration on dubbing compared with the conventional
consumer analog VCR units can be accomplished.Such consumer digital VCR machines utilizing the 
compressing techniques are capable of providing higher image
quality than the conventional consumer analog VCR machines.
Also, these digital VCR machines can be built in smaller
size. Furthermore, it is considered that the consumer VCR
machines can be fabricated in lower cost because they can be
mass-produced.Magnetic disks, magnetic tape, and others have been
known as recording media
