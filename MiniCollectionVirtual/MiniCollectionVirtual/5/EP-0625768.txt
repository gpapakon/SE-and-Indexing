<ABSTRACT>
Automatic system for collecting tolls for the use of roads by vehicles. The vehicles have a vehicle-mounted device with a communication device, a vehicle transceiver and an electronic credit system in the form of a processor card. Payment stations are arranged on the roads, the said payment stations carrying out an exchange of data with a wireless communication device and deducting a toll for use of the road. According to the invention, in addition to the communication device (IRK) of the payment station (ZS) there is a vehicle-locating device which detects the position of the approaching vehicle (FZ) on the basis of a brief optical signal (OS) output by the vehicle transceiver in that the temporary identification which is known to the communication record is assigned to this optical signal. The optical signal can be an infrared flashlight which is emitted at the request of the payment station. The vehicle locating device (FZL) is an infrared light-sensitive video camera (IRV) which detects the position on the basis of the optical imaging of this vehicle (FZ1) by means of computer-controlled evaluation.

<CLAIMS>
Automatic toll collection system for road use
by vehicles (FZ) which have an on-board appliance with

a communications device, a vehicle transceiver and an
electronic purse in the form of a processor card,

having toll stations (ZS) which are arranged on the
roads, carry out a data interchange with at least one

wire-free communications device (IRK) fitted on or
above the road, and debit a usage charge while ensuring

the anonymity of the vehicle user, characterized in
that, in addition to the communications device (IRK) in

the toll station (ZS), a vehicle location device (FZL)
is arranged, which determines the position of the

currently communicating vehicle (FZ) on the basis of a
brief optical signal (OS) emitted by the vehicle

transceiver, in that the temporary identification which
is known from the communication protocol is allocated

to this optical signal (OS).
Automatic toll collection system according to
Claim 1, characterized in that the optical signal (OS)

is formed by an infrared light flash which is emitted
on request by the toll station (ZS), and in that the

vehicle location device (FZL) is formed by a video
camera (IRV) which is sensitive to infrared light and

uses computer-controlled evaluation to determine the
position of this vehicle (FZ1).
Automatic toll collection system according to
Claim 1, characterized in that the debiting is carried 

out within a specific communication region (KB) or
communication boundary (KG), and in that the debiting

is acknowledged by an acknowledgement signal (QS) and
is documented on the processor card.
Automatic toll collection system according to
Claim 2 or 3, characterized in that, once debiting has

been completed with the acknowledgement signal (QS),
the separate optical signal (OS) is also emitted.
Automatic toll collection system according to
Claim 4, characterized in that the toll station (ZS)

has a vehicle detection device (FZD) for all vehicles
(FZ1,2,3 ...) which are located in the communication or

payment region (KB or KG, respectively), and is co-ordinated
(COR) with the vehicle location device (FZL),

and in that those vehicles (FZ2) which have not emitted
an acknowledgement signal (QS) are determined,

identified and recorded (FIR) by means of the vehicle
location and vehicle detection devices (FZL, FZD).
Automatic toll collection system according to
Claim 5, characterized in that the vehicle detection

device (FZD) is formed by a video monitoring camera
(NV) with video recording and evaluation (VS and REC or

FIR).
Automatic toll collection system according to
Claim 5, characterized in that the vehicle detection

device (FZD) is formed by a traffic radar (RD) which
detects the indivi
dual vehicles (FZ1,2,3...) separately
on the basis of the lanes (SP1,2,3,...) and, in

addition, has an associated and co-ordinated vehicle
identification and recording device (FIR) for those who

do not pay (FZ2 and 6).
Automatic toll collection system according to
one of the preceding claims, characterized in that the

communications devices (IRK) in the toll station (FZ)
and in the vehicles (FZ) operate using microwave

transmission.
Automatic toll collection system according to
one of the Claims 1 to 7, characterized in that the 

communications devices (IRK) in the toll station (ZS)
and in the vehicles (FZ) operate using infrared light

transmission devices.
Automatic toll collection system according to
Claim 9, characterized in that the infrared light

transmission devices are additionally designed to
transmit traffic data and management information for a

traffic management and information system between the
vehicles (FZ) and the toll stations (ZS).
Automatic toll collection system according to
Claim 2, characterized in that the video camera which

is sensitive to infrared light has an optical filter
which is matched to the wavelength of the infrared

light flashes.
Automatic toll collection system according to
Claim 2, characterized in that the camera which is

sensitive to infrared light is ready to receive only
during the transmission of the infrared light flashes.
Automatic toll collection system according to
Claim 2, 11 or 12, characterized by a predetermined

geometric arrangement of a plurality of transmitting
diodes in the vehicle transceiver, in such a manner

that the optical signal (OS) which is transmitted from
it as an infrared light flash has a characteristic

pattern for the computer-controlled evaluation.
Automatic toll collection system according to
one of Claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the vehicle

location device (FZL) records an optical image during
the transmission of the optical signal (OS) and records

a second optical image immediately after this, which it
uses to form a different image.
