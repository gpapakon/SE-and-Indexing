<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method and an arrangement 
using an extra member (10) intended to be connected to the 

ordinary grounding plane system of an antenna (1) through a 
portion a the coaxial input terminal (4) sleeve (6) being present 

outside the case (2) of an apparatus. The extra member (10) is 
tuned in such a way that it preferably operates as an electrical 

quarter-wave radiator in a range at the upper limit of a designed 
operating frequency range, while the remaining effective 

grounding plane system of the antenna is preferably tuned to a 
frequency in a range at the lower limit of the intended operating 

frequency range, where, for instance, a portable radio telephone 
should operate, to in this way obtain an increased bandwidth and 

a reduced influence of immediate surrounding environment of the 
antenna of the portable equipment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and an arrangement
utilizing said method to improve the efficiency and the bandwidth
of an antenna, and particularly the present invention relates to
a method and an arrangement to minimize the influence on the
antenna, for instance, by a hand of a user holding a pocket
telephone provided with a compact antenna.An antenna for a pocket telephone is usually formed as a short
antenna member which electrically corresponds to a length of a
half-wave or a quarter-wave at the operating frequency of said
pocket telephone.The Swedish published patent application SE 468 917, having the
same assignee as the present application, is disclosing an
example of such a compact miniature antenna having essentially
a rectangularly shaped current distribution between the base and
the top and which member is quite suitable as an antenna for a
pocket telephone.However, a remaining problem for such an antenna to operate
fairly satisfactory is that it generally demands the presence of
a grounding plane to form an efficacious antenna system.
Normally, if the case of the pocket telephone is conducting, that
should constitute a grounding plane for the antenna. Anyhow this
has the drawback that there might be troublesome uncontrolled
circulating currents in the equipment, which currents also may
have an injurious effect on the possibility of the antenna system
to properly radiate radio energy.An common way therefore is, like as was demonstrated in the above
published patent application SE 468 917, to make a particular,
usually also tuned, grounding plane connected to the antenna to
form an antenna system, and to have this grounding plane 
insulated from the rest of an eventually conducting structure of_
the pocket telephone. This grounding plane then must be placed
immediately adjacent to the antenna itself, which is normally
positioned at the top of the equipment and adjacent to the
portion the user will put to his ear, but, as demonstrated in the
published patent application, avoiding to bring down the
grounding plane to the portion of the equipment which will be
enclosed by the hand of a user. However, the hand and the ear
will, for instance, influence the tuning of this grounding plane
system and the antenna because a part of the irradiated energy
by the field distribution in the antenna near field will be
transferred to the equipment chassis and the designer therefore
has little control of the grounding plane function, which thus
will be dependent of the way a user holds the

<CLAIMS>
A method for improving efficiency and bandwidth of an
antenna device (1) of a portable equipment comprising a radio

transmitter/receiver, e.g., in the shape of a pocket telephone,
characterized in
that
 the impedance and electromagnetic radiation field is
influenced by the introduction of an added conical helix shaped

member (10) disposed around the base of the antenna radiator
and connected to the antenna grounding plane system, whereby,

due to that a user is holding said portable equipment provided
with said antenna device, a decreased influence on the antenna

operation and its radiation field is obtained, and
that the added conical helix shaped member (10) is tuned
to a resonance frequency within the operating frequency range

of the portable equipment, the resonance frequency of said
added member is set at approximately an upper limiting

frequency of the operating frequency range, while the rest of
the antenna grounding plane system is resonantly tuned to a

lower frequency within the frequency range in which said
portable equipment is supposed to operate, whereby an increased

bandwidth of the antenna system is obtained, which is
advantageously as the frequency limits of the antenna system

impedance matching may be displaced by the influence of the
adjacent external environment, said influence being strongly

reduced by said added conical helix shaped member (10).
The method according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the
added member (10) is made as a coaxial screw shaped open coiled

line or a helical conically open coiled line at a lower end of
said antenna device (1) and being connected to an outer sleeve

(6) of an antenna coaxial input terminal (4) being by an
insulating washer (3) insulated from the external surface of

the portable equipment, the inductance of said added member
(10), in cooperation with stray capacitances present, forming a

resonance frequency corresponding to a quarter-wave element
within the operating frequency range, whereby the electromagnetic

field is concentrated to an area between the antenna
element and the added member (10), and to the remaining 

grounding plane system connected to the antenna device, the
energy transfer to remaining parts of the portable equipment

being reduced.
An arrangement of an antenna element device (1) onto an
apparatus in form of a portable equipment comprising a radio

transmitter/receiver, e.g., in the shape of a pocket telephone,

a grounding plane cooperating with said radiator, 
characterized

that to the portion of said coaxial input terminal (4)
sleeve (6) being positioned outside the case (2) of said

portable equipment an added member (10) is arranged around the base of the radiator member, said added
member (10) being formed as a coaxial screw shaped line having

a cylindrical or a conical shape,
that said added member (10) additionally forms a portion
of the operative grounding plane of said antenna,
that said extra member (10) operates as a resonance
circuit, meaning that said member is tuned to an appropriate

frequency in association with operating frequency range of the
antenna device (1) .
The arrangement according to claim 3, 
characterized in
that
 said antenna device (1) forms a compact half-wave antenna,
which due to a top loop (1a) attains a rectangular current

distribution,

   that said added member (10) is a coaxial outward open
helix having a maximum diameter approximately corresponding to

the top loop diameter, said arrangement being embedded in an
electrically non-conducting material to form an antenna device

having the shape of a frustum of a cone.
The arrangement according to claim 4, 
characterized in
that
 said extra member (10) is tuned to be resonant preferably
near to the upper limiting frequency of a concerned operating 

frequency range, the rest of said antenna operating grounding
plane being preferably tuned to a frequency at the lower

limiting frequency of the intended operating frequency range
where the portable pocket telephone should operate to thereby

further obtain an increased bandwidth and a reduced influence
of the immediate surrounding environment for the antenna of the

portable equipment.
The arrangement according to claim 5,
characterized in that
 said extra member (10) is tuned in such a
manner that it operates as an electric quarter-wave radiator

within the range adjacent to the upper limit of an intended
operation frequency range, while the rest of said antenna

operating grounding plane being tuned to a frequency at or
within an adjacent range at the lower limiting frequency of the

intended operating frequency range where the portable pocket
telephone should operate to thereby further obtain an increased

bandwidth and a reduced influence of the immediate surrounding
environment for the antenna of the portable equipment.
An antenna device for a portable equipment comprising a
radio transmitter/receiver, e.g., in the shape of a pocket

telephone, whereby an antenna element (1), intended to operate
at least within the range 825 - 970 MHz, is in the shape of an

embedded radiator having an essentially rectangular current
