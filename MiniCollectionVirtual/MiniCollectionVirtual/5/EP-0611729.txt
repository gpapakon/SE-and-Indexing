<ABSTRACT>
There are here provided a method for 
biodegrading trichloroethylene which comprises the step 

of bringing an aqueous medium containing 
trichloroethylene into contact with microorganisms 

having a trichloroethylene degrading ability derived 
from intestines of termites to degrade 

trichloroethylene; a method for obtaining the 
microorganisms; a method for remediating a soil by the 

use of the microorganisms; and a method for 
biodegrading an chlorinated organic compound with the 

microorganisms.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for
biodegrading a chloroethylene compound by the use of
microorganisms derived from intestines of termites.
More specifically, it relates to a biodegradation
method useful for the purification of sewage or waste
water containing at least one of trichloroethylene (TCE) and
dichloroethylene (DCE), a method for
remediating a soil by the utilization of
microorganisms of the species Pseudomonas cepacia KK01(FERM BP-4235),
and a method for obtaining these
microorganisms useful for the biodegradation of TCE and DCE.Furthermore, the present invention relates to the above
biodegradation method using said microorganisms in which an
TCE or DCE degrading activity can be
induced with an inducer.In recent years, various environmental inspections
have reported that harmful and less degradable aromatic
chemical substances have been detected, and in
consequence, much attention has now been paid to
environmental pollution with these substances. The
influence of these substances on ecological system is
feared. Therefore, in order to prevent the pollution with
these less degradable chemical substances, it is
required to rapidly develop a technique by which these
substances are inhibited from getting into the
environment. For example, it is strongly desired to
establish a technique by which the less degradable
harmful substances can be effectively removed from
sewage or waste water. Furthermore, the pollution of a
soil with the less degradable harmful substances not
only hinders the reutilization of the soil but also
causes further escalation of the pollution due to the
running of the pollutant into groundwater, which is a
serious social problem. Therefore, it is strongly
desired to establish a technique by which the
escalation of the pollution with the less degradable
chemical substances can be prevented and the polluted
environment can be remediated.In particular, TCE is an chlorinated organic
compound which has been used in IC industries, dry
cleaning and the like, and it is a carcinogen. Thus,
the environmental pollution with TCE inclusive of the
problem of the soil pollution caused by the pollution
of groundwater is a serious social problem.
Accordingly, the removal and the degradation of TCE
contained in the environment, the purification of
sewage or waste water containing TCE, and the
remediation of the polluted soil are important themes 
from the viewpoint of environmental protection.As a removal treatment and a degradation treatment
of TCE, there are an adsorption
