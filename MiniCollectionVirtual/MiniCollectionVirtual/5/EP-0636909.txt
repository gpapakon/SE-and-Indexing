in which, under the high temperature and high humidity, 

degradation of characteristics does not occur and which has 
strength against oscillation, a simple structure, and high 

reliability. The module unit (30) is formed by bonding a 
connector (32) provided at one end of a single-optical fiber 

cable (22) and a connector (31) provided at one end of a ribbon 
optical fiber cable (21) at both ends of a waveguide 

substrate (35) having a 1x4 branch optical waveguide by an 
adhesive having light transmission properties. The module 

unit (30) is provided in a housing (10). Liquid resin is poured 
into the housing and at least a 

connecting portion between the optical waveguide and the 
optical fiber cable is covered with resin contained in the 

housing (10). The housing (10) is sealed with a cover unit, and 
the single-optical fiber cable (22) and the ribbon optical 

fiber cable (21) are tightly inserted into a respective hole 
at end walls of the housing (10) and led out to the outside.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical
waveguide module which is used in an optical fiber
communication network and others, as well as to a method
of producing such optical waveguide module.An optical waveguide module comprising, e.g., an
optical branching filter and others, generally comprises
a module unit which is formed by bonding end faces of
optical fiber cables with a respective end face of an
optical waveguide and which is housed in a housing. In
such optical waveguide module, under high temperature
and high humidity, an adhesive which is used in the
connecting portion between the optical waveguide and the
optical fibers moistens and is degraded, which causes the
degradation of characteristics: increase of loss and
light reflection, degrade of tensile strength.Therefore, the housing is sealed with, e.g., a
nitrogen gas (N2). Alternatively, the housing is filled
with a jelly-like resin. As such conventional
techniques, for example, a technique disclosed in
"Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. HEI 5-27139 (27139/1993)"
is known. According to this prior art documents an optical waveguide module comprises two U-shaped housing parts defining a space accomodating an optical waveguide substrate sealed in resin. As a technique of coating the outside of the
housing with a resin, for example, a technique disclosed 
in "Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. HEI 5-45531 (45531/1993)"
is known.US-H-0595 (Statutory Invention Registration) discloses an optical fibre connector assembly comprising first and second housing elements, a cavity being provided in the lower housing element to accomodate spliced optical fiber ends embedded in sealing material.It is an object of the present invention to provide an
optical waveguide module with high weather resistance and
long-term high reliability which is also simple in structure
and easy to manufacture.This object is solved according to the present invention by
an optical waveguide module comprising the features of
claim 1, as well as by a method of producing such module comprising the features of claim 6. Detailed embodiments are described in the dependent
claims. In this specification and claims, a waveguide-device
means a device including a wave-guide substrate itself, a 
device in which various optical elements are added into
the wave-guide substrate, or a device in which a
waveguide forming surface of the waveguide substrate is
covered with a resin etc.According to the present invention, since the
housing has a depth larger than the thickness of the module
unit, the
