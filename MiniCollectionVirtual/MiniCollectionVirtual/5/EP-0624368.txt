<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a method for treating 
AIDS. The method comprises the step of administering a 

therapeutically effective amount of an antiretroviral 
agent and a therapeutically effective amount of an 

intracellular glutathione stimulator to an HIV positive 
patient. In a preferred embodiment, the antiretroviral 

agent comprises AZT. In an embodiment, the composition 
for stimulating the intracellular glutathione levels 

comprises L-2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the 
treatment of disease states in patients. More 
specifically, the present invention relates to the 
treatment of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) Presently, 3'-Azidothymidine (AZT) is the primary 
therapy for the treatment of AIDS. AZT is an 
antiretroviral drug that is active against human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In this regard, AZT is an 
inhibitor of the in vitro replication of some 
retroviruses, including HIV. AZT is marketed by the 
Burroughs Wellcome Company under the name Retrovir. 
Retrovir is the brand name for Zidovudine (formerly 
called azidothymidine (AZT)). See Physician Desk 
Reference, 44th Edition, 1990, pg. 799. Recently, attention has been focussed on another 
potential treatment for AIDS using DDI. DDI is also an 
antiretroviral drug. Unfortunately, AZT has a significant dose dependent 
toxicity. In fact, the 1990 PDR bears the following 
statement:
 
   Warning
 
   Therapy with Retrovoir (Zidovudine) is often 
associated with hematologic toxicity including 
granulocytopenia and severe anemia requiring 
transfusions (see warnings).  AZT related bone marrow toxicity limits the utility 
of the drug. See, Thompson et al, "Hematologic Toxicity 
of AZT and ddC Administered as Single Agent and in 
Combination to Rats and Mice", Fundamental and Applied 
Toxicity, 17, 159-176 (1991). Although the basis of the 
toxicity is not completely understood, some evidence 
suggests a metabolite of AZT, 3'-amino-3'-deoxythymidine 
(AMT), may be at least partially responsible. See, 
Cretton, "Catabolism of 3'-Azido-3'-deoxythymidine in 
Hepatocytes in Liver Microsomes, with Evidence of 
Formation of 3'-Amino-3'-deoxythymidine, a Highly Toxic 
Catabolite for Human Bone Marrow Cells", Molecular 
Pharmacology, 39:258-266. It has been reported that some 
thiols, including reduced glutathione, can reduce AZT to 
AMT in vivo. See, Handlon et al, "Thiol Reduction of 3'-Azidothymidine 
to 3'-Aminothymidine: Kinetics and 
Biomedical Implications", Pharmaceutical Research, Vol. 
5, No. 5, 1988. Additionally, long term administration of AZT can 
cause mitochondrial mycotoxicity. See, Lamperth et al, 
"Abnormal Skeletal and Cardiac Muscle Mitochondria 
Induced by Zidovudine (AZT) in Human Muscles In Vitro and 
in Animal Model", Laboratory Investigation, 1991, 65:742. 
This results in a myopathy that develops after a mean 
period of 12 months of therapy. Id.Further adverse reactions have been reported with 
AZT. Additionally, DDI has been reported to
