conductivity type semiconductor substrate (1); a first conductivity

(5) on the 

first upper cladding layer, where z is equal to or larger than 
0.6; a second conductivity type second upper cladding (17) layer

As including a stripe shaped ridge 
region 

portion and thin film layer portions on the light reflecting 
layer; and first conductivity type current blocking layers 

disposed on the said both side thin film portions of the second 
upper cladding layer so as to bury the ridge region portion. 

Therefore, the surface defect density can be reduced from 
10⁶/cm² in the prior art to 10⁴/cm², and thus the surface 

morphology is improved to a great extent and a high reliability 
semiconductor laser device having preferable device 

characteristics is obtained. When the total thickness of the 
first upper cladding layer, the light reflecting layer, the 

thin film layer portion of second upper cladding layer is equal 
to or lower than 0.3µm, there arises no idle current which 

otherwise arises due to the injected current being broadened in 
the transverse direction under the current blocking layers, 

whereby a preferable device characteristics is obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor laser 
and a production method thereof and, more particularly, to 
those having a p type cladding layer on a light reflecting 
layer of a buried ridge type semiconductor laser. Figure 2 shows a cross-sectional view of a buried ridge 
type semiconductor laser diode (hereinafter referred to as 
an ES-LD) with an etching stopper layer (hereinafter 
referred to as an ES layer). This laser has an n type GaAs substrate 1 as a 
substrate. An n type Al0.5Ga0.5As cladding layer 2 is 
disposed on the n type GaAs substrate 1 and a multi quantum 
well (hereinafter referred to as MQW) structure active layer 
3 comprising GaAs and Al0.2Ga0.8As is disposed on the n type 
cladding layer 2. A p type Al0.5Ga0.5As first cladding 
layer 4 and an AlGaAs etching stopper layer 5 having Al 
composition ratio of above 0.6 are successively disposed on 
the MQW active layer 3. A p type Al0.5Ga0.5As second 
cladding layer 6 formed in a ridge shape 8 together with a p 
type GaAs contact layer 7 formed on the layer 6 and n type 
GaAs current blocking layers 9 burying the both sides of the 
ridge 8 and having Zn diffused layers 10 including Zn as p 
type dopants diffused at its upper portion are disposed on  
 
the etching stopper layer 5. An n side electrode 15 is 
formed on the rear surface of the n type GaAs substrate 1 
and a p side electrode 16 is formed on the p type GaAs 
contact layer 7 and the Zn diffusion layer 10 at the front 
surface of the device. A description is given of the operation of this ES-LD. When to operate the semiconductor laser, a forward 
direction voltage is applied between the p side electrode 16 
and the n side electrode 15, electrons are injected from the 
side of n type GaAs substrate 1 and holes are injected from 
the side of p type cap layer (contact layer) 7. The 
injected holes are confined to the element central portion 
by the n type GaAs current blocking layers 9, and the 
electrons and holes are efficiently recombined in the active 
layer 3 direct below the ridge 8, thus emitting light of 
wavelength corresponding to the energy gap of the active 
layer 3. In this prior art device, the emitted light has a 
wavelength of 780 nm. The light generated direct below the 
ridge 8 tends to be broadened along the active layer 3 in 
the horizontal direction, but by the light absorption effect 
due to the current blocking layers 9 disposed in the 
vicinity of the active layer 3, an effective refractive 
index difference is made in the active layer 3 in the 
h
