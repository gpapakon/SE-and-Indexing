<ABSTRACT>
In a method for cooling a gas turbine plant, in particular a combustion chamber (1) and a turbine (2), the combustion chamber (1) and the turbine (2) are connected in series for cooling purposes. Before entry into the combustion chamber, a small mass flow (7) of cooling air is branched off from the main mass flow (6) of air. Said mass flow of cooling air can be fed to a heat exchanger (3) in which thermal energy is extracted from the mass flow (7) of cooling air. The mass flow (7) of cooling air is subsequently used for convective cooling of the combustion chamber (1) and thereafter to cool the turbine (2).
