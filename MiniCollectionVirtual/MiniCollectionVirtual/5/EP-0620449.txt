<ABSTRACT>
An integrity monitor for TCAS mutual suppression 
checks the interface circuits and cabling of the 

suppression system that lies between the TCAS processor 
and the transponder. The monitor starts by 

interrogating the transponder while disabling 
suppression. If no reply is received, the transponder 

is not functional. If a reply is received, 
interrogation of the transponder occurs again, however, 

this time suppression is enabled. If a reply is 
received, the suppression system has failed and TCAS 

alarms will be inhibited. If a reply is not received, 
the suppression system is working.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to Traffic Alert and 
Collision Avoidance Systems (TCAS) and more 
particularly to detecting failures in the TCAS 
processor. TCAS, the Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance 
System, provides for safe separation of airborne 
traffic. To accomplish this, an airborne interrogator, 
the TCAS processor, interrogates an ATC transponder of 
other aircraft that are in the proximity of the TCAS 
equipped aircraft. The replies from the transponders 
of the other aircraft provide altitude and range of the 
other aircraft to the TCAS system. The TCAS equipped 
aircraft also carries an ATC transponder. In order to 
ensure that the transponder on the TCAS equipped 
aircraft does not reply to interrogations from its own 
TCAS it is equipped with a system called mutual 
suppression. The mutual suppression signal from the  
 
TCAS processor effectively disables the ATC transponder 
on the TCAS equipped aircraft at the time of 
interrogation. The ATC transponder is enabled again 
after the interrogation. The time that the transponder 
is suppressed is very brief (less than 90 
microseconds). The mutual suppression signal is applied to the 
transponder via a cable which connects the TCAS 
processor, the ATC transponder, and other avionics 
equipment which might be affected by the TCAS 
transmission. If this cable becomes disconnected, or 
the interface circuits in the transponder or TCAS 
processor fail to function, it is possible for the TCAS 
processor to receive replies from its own transponder. 
If the TCAS processor receives these replies 
consistently, it will interpret them as coming from a 
very close aircraft which is at the same altitude as 
its own aircraft. This will cause a spurious alarm to 
be presented to the pilot. It will seem as though 
there is another aircraft very close to the pilot's 
aircraft and he will be instructed to maneuver to avoid 
it. Since the other aircraft is actually his own, the 
other aircraft will seem to follow him no matter what 
action he takes. The present invention comprises a system capable 
of determining the integrity of the mutual suppression 
system of a TCAS unit. The present invention will 
inhibit alarms when it detects a failure of the mutual  
 
suppression system and will also annunciate the failure 
to maintenance personnel. The system starts by interrogating its own 
transponder while disabling suppression. If no reply 
is received, the transponder is not functional. If a 
reply is received, interrogation of its own transponder 
occurs
