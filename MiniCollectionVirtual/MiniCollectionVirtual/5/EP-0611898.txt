<ABSTRACT>
In a wedging-roller or sprag freewheel with a plastic cage which is fixed axially in a snap-in groove in an outer race by means of corresponding radial snap-in projections provided on a flange and is connected on at least one side to a metallic back-up ring of U-shaped cross-section which supports the outer race in a centred manner relative to the inner race and in such a way that it can slide relative to the latter, the metallic back-up ring (12) is provided on its base with a number of axial openings (13) and the adjacent flange (8) of the plastic cage (4) is provided with a corresponding number of axially projecting pegs (10) which, after passing through the openings (13), are melted down by the action of an ultrasonic welding head or the like.

<CLAIMS>
Roller or sprag one-way clutch having a cage (4) of
plastics material, which is axially secured by radial

locking lugs (9) provided on a rim (7) engaging in a
corresponding locking groove (11) in an outer bearing race

(2) and is connected on one side to a U-section metal
supporting ring (12) which centres the outer bearing race

(2) and provides it with sliding bearing support relative
to the inner bearing race (3), the metal supporting ring

(12) being provided on its base with a number of axial
openings (13) and the plastics material cage (4) being

provided on its rim (8) adjacent to the metallic supporting
ring (12) with a corresponding number of axially projecting

pegs which project into the openings (9),

characterised in that

only one lateral, metal supporting ring (12) is
connected to the plastics material cage (4),
the pegs (10) projecting into the openings (13) are
melted down by means of an ultrasonic welding head or

the like and
the openings (13) in the base of the metal supporting
ring (12 or 12') are either countersunk (17) or

provided with a pre-positioned impression (18).
