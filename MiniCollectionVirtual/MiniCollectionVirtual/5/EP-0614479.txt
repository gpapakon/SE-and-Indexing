Method of preventing or reducing the discoloration 
of coating films which occurs after stoving 

when these films have been prepared by cathodic 
deposition of aqueous electrodeposition coating materials 

which are contaminated with transition metal ions, 
especially iron ions, and which contain as binder 


A-1
at least one cationic, amine-modified epoxy resin 
which contains active hydrogen atoms, or 
A-2
at least one cationic polyacrylate resin which 
contains active hydrogen atoms, or 
A-3
a mixture of at least one cationic, amine-modified 
epoxy resin which contains active hydrogen atoms and 

at least one cationic polyacrylate resin which 
contains active hydrogen atoms, and as crosslinking 

agent 
B
at least one aliphatic or cycloaliphatic blocked 
polyisocyanate which is part of the amine-modified 

epoxy resin or part of the cationic polyacrylate 
resin or is present as a separate component or is 

both part of the amine-modified epoxy resin and/or 
cationic polyacrylate resin and is present as a 

separate component, 
 
characterized in that at least one ester of 3-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionic 

acid and a polyalcohol 
is incorporated into the electrodeposition 

coating materials. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that pentaerythrityl tetrakis[3-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionate]
 
is incorporated into the 

electrodeposition coating materials. 
Electrodeposition coating materials which are 
contaminated with transition metal ions, especially iron  

 
ions, and which contain as binder 


A-1
at least one cationic, amine-modified epoxy resin 
which contains active hydrogen atoms, or 
A-2
at least one cationic polyacrylate resin which 
contains active hydrogen atoms, or 
A-3
a mixture of at least one cationic, amine-modified 
epoxy resin which contains active hydrogen atoms and 

at least one cationic polyacrylate resin which 
contains active hydrogen atoms, and as crosslinking 

agent 
B
at least one aliphatic or cycloaliphatic blocked 
polyisocyanate which is part of the amine-modified 

epoxy resin or part of the cationic polyacrylate 
resin or is present as a separate component or is 

both part of the amine-modified epoxy resin and/or 
cationic polyacrylate resin and is present as a 

separate component, 
 
characterized in that they contain at least one ester of 

3-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid and 
a polyalcohol. 
Electrodeposition coating materials according to 
Claim 3, characterized in that they contain pentaerythrityl 

tetrakis[3-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionate]. 
Use of esters of 3-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionic 
acid and polyalcohols for preventing or 

reducing the discoloration of coating films which occurs 
after stoving, when the films have been prepared by 

cathodic deposition of aqueous electrodeposition coating 
materials which are contaminated with transition metal 

ions, especially iron ions, and which contain as binder 

A-1
at least one cationic, amine-modified epoxy resin 
which contains active hydrogen atoms, or  

 
A-2
at least one cationic polyacrylate resin which 
contains active hydrogen atoms, or 
A-3
a mixture of at least one cationic, amine-modified 
epoxy resin which contains active hydrogen atoms and 

at least one cationic polyacrylate resin which 
contains active hydrogen atoms, and as crosslinking 

agent 
B
at least one aliphatic or cycloaliphatic blocked 
polyisocyanate which is part of the amine-modified 

epoxy resin or part of the cationic polyacrylate 
resin or is present as a separate component or is 

both part of the amine-modified epoxy resin and/or 
cationic polyacrylate resin and is present as a 

separate component. 
Use according to Claim 5, characterized in that 
pentaerythrityl tetrakis[3-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionate]
 
is employed.
