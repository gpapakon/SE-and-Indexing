<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a process for packing a 
drum-shaped electrophotographic photoreceptor comprising the 

steps of folding a wrapping-start edge portion (1a) of a 
light-shielding packing sheet (1) outwardly in a diametrical 

direction of the photoreceptor (D) across a width of the 
packing sheet (1), and wrapping the packing sheet (1) on a 

circumferential surface of the photoreceptor (D). 
The packing process of the present invention enables an 

electrophotographic photoreceptor (D), which has a small 
diameter, or has a soft surface and is susceptible to 

scratching, to be packed without forming scratches on its 
surface and decreasing its photosensitivity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to processes for packing a
drum-shaped electrophotographic photoreceptor for
transportation and storage by wrapping its circumferential
surface in a packing sheet such as a black paper.Conventionally,
referring to GB-A-2220382, US-A-4860898, JP-A-61-138281 and
JP-A-57-192984, the packing of drum-shaped
electrophotographic photoreceptors for transportation and
storage is achieved by wrapping their circumferential surface in
a light-shielding packing sheet such as a black paper and
further wrapping the packing sheet in a cushioning material.In recent years, there have occurred image defects due to
scratches formed on the surface of electrophotographic
photoreceptors by an edge portion of a packing sheet especially
at the time of its unpacking. Such scratches cause black
and/or white lines appearing in an image formed on the portions
corresponding to the scratches on the photoreceptor.
This tendency is aggravated, as image forming apparatus such
as electrostatic copying machines become downsized and, at the
same time, the diameter of electrophotographic photoreceptors
installed therein is decreased.Conventionally, a relatively thick packing sheet has
tightly wrapped the surface of an electrophotographic
photoreceptor in order to perfectly shield the photoreceptor 
from light. However, if an electrophotographic photoreceptor
with a smaller diameter is packed in the conventional way, the
packing sheet is warped, and an edge portion of the warped
packing sheet scratches the surface of the electrophotographic
photoreceptor, particularly when it is unpacked.For example, when an electrophotographic photoreceptor D
is unpacked by removing a packing sheet 1' in a
circumferential direction of the photoreceptor D as shown by a
white arrow in Fig. 3(a), a wrapping-start edge portion 1a' of
the packing sheet 1' scratches the surface of the
photoreceptor D in a circumferential direction thereof as
shown by a black arrow in a fragmentary enlarged view of Fig.
3(a), thereby forming scratches K1 on the surface of the
photoreceptor D in a circumferential direction thereof as
shown in Fig. 3(b).When the electrophotographic photoreceptor D is unpacked
by drawing out the packing sheet 1' in an axial direction of
the photoreceptor D as shown by a white arrow in Fig. 4(a),
the wrapping-start edge portion 1a' of the packing sheet 1'
scratches the surface of the photoreceptor D along a contact
line, thereby forming a scratch K2 on the surface of the
photoreceptor D along the contact line as shown in

A process for packing a drum-shaped
electrophotographic photoreceptor, characterized by the steps

of:

folding a wrapping-start edge portion (la) of a
light-shielding packing sheet (1) outwardly in a

diametrical direction of the electrophotographic
photoreceptor (D) across the width of the packing sheet

(1); and
wrapping the packing sheet (1) on a

circumferential surface of the electrophotographic
photoreceptor (D).
A process for packing a drum-shaped
electrophotographic photoreceptor, characterized in that


a wrapping-start edge portion (la) of a light-shielding
packing sheet (1) is folded across the width

of the packing sheet (1); and
the packing sheet is wrapped around the
circumferential surface of an electrophotographic

photoreceptor (D) in such a way that the edge portion
(la) of the packing sheet (1) is folded over onto the

packing sheet and lies between the outer surface of the
portion of the packing sheet immediately adjacent the

edge portion and the inner surface of the packing sheet
after it has passed around the circumferential surface

of the electrophotographic photoreceptor (D).
A process according to claim 1 or 2, wherein
the packing sheet (1) has an opacity in the range from

90% to 100% which is calculated from the following
equation:


Opacity (%) = (R
W
/R
B
) x 100

where R
W
 and R
B
 are reflection densities of the packing
sheet (1) placed on white and black backgrounds,

respectively.
A process according to any preceding claim, 
wherein the packing sheet (1) is a black paper having a

thickness of 0.08mm to 0.3mm.
A process according to any preceding claim,
wherein the electrophotographic photoreceptor (D) has a

Vicker's hardness of 45 or less.
A process according to any preceding claim,
wherein the electrophotographic photoreceptor (D) has a

diameter of 40mm or less.
