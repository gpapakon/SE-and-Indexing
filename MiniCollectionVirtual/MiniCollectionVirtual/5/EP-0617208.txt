<ABSTRACT>
The arrangement forms a support unit which is suitable particularly for supporting the input shaft of a driving motor of electric drive vehicles in the engine casing. The outer race 1 of the bearing and the inner race 3 of the bearing are provided with a radially outward-pointing and a radially inward-pointing flange 4 respectively to allow them to be screwed to the supporting part 9 and to the end of the shaft or axle 11 respectively. The outer race 1 of the bearing and the inner race 3 of the bearing have cylindrical centering surfaces 15, 13 which are used for guidance in a bore of the supporting part 9 and on a corresponding section of the shaft or axle 11 respectively. The support unit is furthermore provided with seals 5, 6 on both sides.

<CLAIMS>
Arrangement for the support, in a supporting part, of one end of a shaft or axle,
namely of the drive shaft of a drive motor of electric traction vehicles in the motor casing,

having a bearing inner race (3, 32) and a bearing outer race (1, 29) between which a race of
rolling bodies (7, 31) is arranged, the intermediate space being sealed by seals (5 and 6), the

bearing outer race (1, 29) being provided with a cylindrical centering surface (15) for
centering guidance in a corresponding bore of the supporting part (9) and the bearing inner

race (3, 32) being provided with a cylindrical centering surface (13) for centering guidance on
a corresponding section of the shaft or axle (11), characterized in that the bearing outer race

(1, 29) has holes for bolt connection to the supporting part (9) and the bearing inner race (3,
32) has a flange (4) directed radially inwards for bolt connection to the end of the shaft or axle

(11) and in that the bearing outer race (1, 29) is fashioned integrally with a flange (2) directed
radially outwards, both flanges (2, 4) being provided with through holes for bolt fastening

from outside on the end surfaces of the shaft (11) and the supporting part (9) arranged on one
of the sides of the bearing.
Arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized in that the flange surface forms
the end surface of the bearing inner race (3, 32) or is in its vicinity and the bearing inner race

(3, 32) has a conical bore (26) so that it forms a constant strength beam starting from the
flange (4).
Arrangement according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that seals are arranged on
both sides of the bearing and one of the seals (5, 6) is provided with a pulse generator (24) for

revolution and speed measurement.
Arrangement according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that the
bearing outer ring (1, 29) has a recess (17) for a thermal sensor, which recess (17) extends to

the vicinity of the rolling body track.
