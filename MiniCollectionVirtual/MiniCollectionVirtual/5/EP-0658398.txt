<ABSTRACT>
The guide rail for drilling, cutting-off and grinding devices has two first and two second pairs of guide surfaces (1, 2, 3, 4) which are essentially symmetrically opposite one another. Both the first and the second pairs of guide surfaces (1, 2, 3, 4) are disposed in a V-shape relative to one another and are arranged next to one another, in which case they extend along the centre axis of the guide rail. Running perpendicularly to a first axis (S1) of symmetry of the two first and two second pairs of guide surfaces (1, 2, 3, 4) is a further axis (S2) of symmetry, relative to which a further pair of guide surfaces (7, 8) are arranged on both sides. The guide surfaces (7, 8) are disposed in a roof shape relative to one another and extend along the longitudinal axis of the rail.

Guide rail for drilling, separating and grinding tools, comprising
two first pairs of guide surfaces (1, 2), which are positioned V-shaped

relative to each other alongside each other on a first
outside (A1) of the guide rail and extending along the

longitudinal rail axis, and a toothed rack (10), which is arranged
in a recess (9) of the first outside (A1) and extending parallel

and in the longitudinal direction of the centre axis of the guide
rail, and openings formed by guide surfaces (1, 2) positioned V-shaped

relative to each other increase towards the outside (A1)
of the guide rail, 
characterised in that
 opposite the first two
pairs of guide surfaces (1, 2) are positioned essentially

symmetrically opposite thereto two pairs of guide surfaces (3, 4)
positioned V-shaped relative to each other and arranged to

extend alongside each other on a second outside (A2) of the
guide rail and along the longitudinal axis of the rail.
Guide rail according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 vertically
to a first symmetry axis (S1 o the first and second pairs of guide

surfaces (1, 2, 3, 4) extends a further symmetry axis (S2) on
both sides of which is arranged at least one each additional pair

of guide surfaces (7, 8), and the guide surfaces (7, 8) are
positioned inclined towards each other and extending along the

longitudinal axis of the rail.
Guide rail according to Claim 2, 
characterised in that
 the
vertex points (P1, P2) of the additional pairs of guide surfaces

(7, 8) lie on the same plane extending vertically to their
symmetry axis (S2).
Guide rail according to Claim 2, or 3, 
characterised in that
 the
additional pairs of guide surfaces (7, 87) are arranged in the

area of the two first pairs of guide surfaces (1, 2).
