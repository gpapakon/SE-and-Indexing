and a handgrip (4), whereby the handgrip (4) is 

provided by at least one at least extensively transparent 
lamination (15), characterized in that the 

lamination (15) covers at least one layer of glowing 
indicator (16).

a handgrip (4), whereby the handgrip (4) is coated 

with at least one at least extensively transparent 
lamination (15) characterized in that the lamination 

(15) covers at least one layer of glowing indicator 
(16). 
Half of a door-handle set as in claims 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the glowing indicator (16) is provided 

as an inlay in the lamination (15) or in the handgrip 
(4) and is of luminescent, fluorescent, or phosphorescent 

material.

claims, characterized in that the glowing inlay (16) 

is a stripe or signage arranged between the handgrip 
(4) and the lamination (15). 
Half of a door-handle set, especially as in one of the 
foregoing claims, characterized in that the handgrip 

(4) and bushing (8) are attached to and can be detached 
from each other.  

 
Half of a door-handle set as in claim 5, characterized 
in that the handgrip (4) and the bushing (8) can be 

screwed together. 
Half of a door-handle set as in claim 5 or 6, characterized 
in that the handgrip (4) and bushing (7,8) 

engage by an interlocking groove, especially a groove 
with a dovetail cross-section. 
Half of a door-handle set as in one of the foregoing 
claims, characterized in that the handgrip (4) essentially 

is a metal or plastic plate with openings. 
Half of a door-handle set as in one of the foregoing 
claims, characterized in that a threaded bolt (14) is 

formed axially to the shaft (11) of the shaft half of 
the door-handle. 
Half of a door-handle set as in one of the foregoing 
claims, characterized in that the bearing half (3) has

with cogs (113) on its outer surface, whereby the 
second component (109) has a bore with cogs (115) on 

its inner surface and fits over the first component 
(108), and whereby a third component (110) has a bore 

(116) with a threaded section (117) that fastens the 
second component to the first component.
