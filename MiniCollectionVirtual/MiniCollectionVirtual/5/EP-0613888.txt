<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of an aqueous medium of 
nicotinaldehyde of the formula 
 
by the catalytic hydrogenation of 3-cyanopyridine of the formula 
 
in the presence of Raney-nickel in an aqueous medium of a carboxylic acid. Nicotinaldehyde (3-pyridinaldehyde) is a useful reagent in the synthesis of agrochemicals. 
For example the insecticide 6-methyl-4-(pyridin-3-yl-methyleneamino)-4,5-dihydro-1,2,4-triazin-3(2H)-one 
can be prepared by the reaction between nicotinaldehyde and the 
aminotriazinone 4-amino-6-methyl-3-oxo-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1,2,4-triazine as described in 
published European patent application EP-A-0 314 615. A synthesis of nicotinaldehyde by hydrogenation of the corresponding nitrile, namely 
3-cyanopyridine, is described in US patent 2,945,862 (cited in C. Ferri, Reaktionen der 
organischen Synthese, 1978, p. 92) in which strongly acidic conditions are advocated. 
Sulfuric or oxalic acids are described as providing suitable conditions and the yields are 
not of a high order. Strongly acidic conditions are proposed using sulfuric, oxalic or 
sulfonic acids. The strong acids poison the Raney-nickel catalyst which suppresses the 
formation of side products.  
 P. Tinapp describes in Chem. Ber., 102, p. 2770 to 2776 (1969) the hydrogenation of 
aromatic nitriles with Raney-nickel in the presence of different acids. The selective saturation 
of the carbon-nitrogen triple bond occurs only in the presence of strong acids, and no 
partial hydrogenation was observed in the presence of acetic acid. A process is described in published PCT application WO 92/02507 in which aldehydes are 
prepared by hydrogenating a mixture of a 3-cyanopyridine and a primary amine in the presence 
of a rhodium-loaded catalyst to form a stable imine intermediate. The hydrogenation 
catalyst is separated from the imine intermediate and this intermediate is then hydrolysed 
to the corresponding aldehyde. However the yields are low and the use of rhodium in 
industrial production processes is extremely expensive. There is a need for an improved nicotinaldehyde synthesis which is more economical and 
ecologically acceptable. The disadvantages of the known processes include low selectivity, 
poor yields and corrosion of the nickel catalyst and the production vessels. Surprisingly it has now been found that a high concentration of nicotinaldehyde can be 
achieved under milder reaction conditions with superior yields and a higher degree of 
selectivity. It has also been found that use
