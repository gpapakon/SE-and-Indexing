<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a driving device for 
an ultrasonic wave motor, in which a limit detecting 

circuit (2,3) detects that the drive voltage for the 
ultrasonic wave motor (100) has reached a limit, and, in 

response, a drive voltage limiting circuit controls 
the drive voltage so as not to go beyond the limit 

value. Such control is conducted on the voltage 
or frequency of a signal for driving the ultrasonic 

wave motor. In another aspect of the invention, 
a drive state detecting circuit detects the drive 

state of the ultrasonic wave motor (100), and a drive 
frequency (or voltage) setting circuit (5,4) controls 

the frequency (or voltage) of a signal for driving 
the ultrasonic wave motor (100) so as to attain the maximum 

efficiency in the motor, based on the output of the 
drive state detecting circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a driving device for an ultrasonic wave motor according
to the preambles of independent claims 1 and 2.Conventionally there have been proposed
various types of driving device for the ultrasonic
wave motor.At first the structure of an ultrasonic
wave motor will be briefly explained with reference
to the attached drawings. Fig. 1 is a cross-sectional
view of an ultrasonic wave motor, in which a rotor
(movable member) is composed of a main rotor member
100-1 and a sliding member 100-2 which are mutually
adhered. Also a stator is composed of an elastic
member 100-3 and a piezoelectric member 100-4 which
are mutually adhered. Said rotor and stator are
maintained in mutual pressure contact to constitute
said ultrasonic vibration motor.Fig. 2 is a view showing the arrangement
of electrodes in said piezoelectric member 100-4.
Input electrodes 100-4a, 100-4b receive AC drive 
voltages of a mutual phase difference of Ï€/2. A
common electrode 100-4c is grounded. A monitor
electrode 100-4d does not contribute to the oscillation
of the elastic member but provides an AC output
voltage corresponding to the vibration state of the
stator.Thus the ultrasonic wave motor consists
of the main rotor member, sliding member, elastic
member and piezoelectric member explained above.
The structure and function of such motor will not
be explained in detail as they are already known
for example from the U.S. Patent No. 4,510,411.
In brief, drive voltages are supplied to said
electrodes 100-4a, 100-4b of the piezoelectric member
to oscillate said member, thereby generating a
travelling vibration wave in the elastic member, and
driving said rotor maintained in pressurized contact
with said stator by unrepresented pressurizing means.A drive control device for such ultrasonic
wave motor is already disclosed for example in the
Japanese Laid-open Patent Appln. Nos. 59-204477
61-251490. These drive control devices are
either (1) to control the frequency of the drive
voltage signals according to the voltage obtained
from the monitor electrode 100-4d, or (2) to control
the frequency of the drive voltage signals according
to the phase difference between the wave form of the 
drive voltage signals applied to the piezoelectric
member 100-4 and that of the voltage signal
obtained from the monitor electrode 100-4d.In addition, for driving such ultrasonic
wave motor, there have been proposed various methods
by varying the drive voltage or by varying the drive
voltage and the drive frequency, as disclosed for
example
