<ABSTRACT>
The use of a compound of formula I 

or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, for the 
manufacture of a medicament to lower blood lipid levels, 

wherein
 

   R¹ is hydroxy or a group capable of being removed 
in 
vivo
 to produce a compound of formula I wherein R¹ is OH; 
and

 
   X and Y are the same or different and are selected 

from hydrogen, trifluoromethyl, fluoro and chloro.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the use of certain 
benzothiazolylmethyl-substituted phthalazineacetic acids, 
and to certain derivatives thereof, to lower lipid levels 
in human patients. The compound zopolrestat, 3,4-dihydro-4-oxo-3-(5-trifluoromethylbenzothiazol-2-ylmethyl)phthalazin-1-ylacetic 
acid, is known, for example from commonly 
assigned U.S. patent 4,939,140 to Larson et al., together 
with a number of compounds related thereto, to have 
utility as aldose reductase inhibitors. Zopolrestat has 
the structure 
and, as an aldose reductase inhibitor, is useful in the 
treatment of certain chronic complications arising from 
diabetes mellitus. U.S. patent 4,492,706 to Kallai-Sanfacon teaches 
that certain aldose reductase inhibitors such as N-[(6-methoxy-5-trifluoromethyl-1-naphthalenyl)thiono]-N-methylglycine 
(commonly known as tolrestat) function as 
antilipogenic agents in mammals. EP 0 310 931 A2 discloses the use of a group of 
compounds, as antilipogenic agents in poultry, including 
tolrestat, having the formula 
wherein R is an alkyl group of 1-6 carbons, R¹ is hydrogen 
or a saturated hydrocarbyl group, R¹¹ is hydrogen, 
hydroxy, or an alkoxy group of 1-6 carbons, R¹¹¹ is 
hydrogen or ((CF₂)nCF₃, X is sulfur or oxygen, and n is 
zero or an integer of at least one. This EP application 
further discloses a poultry feed containing an 
antilipogenic agent having the above formula. The invention provides a method of manufacturing a 
medicament for lowering lipid levels using a compound of 
formula I 
or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, wherein
 
   R¹ is hydroxy or a group capable of being removed in 
vivo to produce a compound of formula I wherein R¹ is OH; 
and
 
   X and Y are the same or different and are selected 
from hydrogen, trifluoromethyl, fluoro, and chloro. The term "lipid-lowering" as employed herein refers 
to the lowering of blood triglycerides. Compounds of 
formula I are useful as lipid-lowering agents in man and, 
in particular, they effect a marked reduction in the 
blood values of triglycerides. On the basis of these 
lipid-lowering properties the compounds can be used in 
human medicine for the treatment and prophylaxis of 
diseases caused by an increased level of triglycerides in 
the blood. Such diseases are primarily cardiovascular 
disorders including, inter alia, thrombosis, 
arteriosclerosis, myocardial infarction and angina 
pectoris.  Compounds useful in this invention are well suited 
to the treatment of diabetics because the compounds are 
aldose
