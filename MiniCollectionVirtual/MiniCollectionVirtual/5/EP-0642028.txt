<ABSTRACT>
The technical equipment for a measurement and experiment system which can be used both for modelling examinations to give the EMC behaviour and also for detecting and evaluating the EMC behaviour of electrical devices, modules or an electronic circuit is described. By virtue of the modular construction of the measurement and experiment system, it is intended to achieve extension of the EMC know-how by training with models or original circuit parts and to allow reproduction and therefore appraisal of the EMC behaviour during the circuit or device design. Correct EMC of the device and circuit design is thereby guaranteed. The measurement and experiment system according to the invention is produced using modules, module components or circuit models, which, by virtue of their variable combination and their adjustment parameters, are matched to the EMC behaviour of the device or of the circuit. When the value of the interference quantity approaches the value which corresponds to a functional defect or when this critical value is reached, a signal is produced by the measurement system. In conjunction therewith, the measurement system signals that its interference threshold, established by adjustment parameters, has been exceeded, after which further required actions and changes of the geometrical arrangement and of the adjustment parameter can be initiated.
