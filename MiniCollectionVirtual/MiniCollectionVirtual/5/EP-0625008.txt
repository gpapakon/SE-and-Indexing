<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a composition for 
protecting plants, e.g. seeds of such economically 
important crops as cotton, peanuts, snap beans, and the 
like, from phytopathogenic fungi, e.g., such genera of the 
classes Basidiomycetes and Deuteromycetes as Rhizoctonia, 
Fusarium, Aspergillus, Penicillium, Ustilago, Tilletia, and 
so forth. More particularly, the invention herein concerns 
a composition containing the endospores of a microorganism 
capable of providing protection from phytopathogenic fungi 
and a chemical fungicide which is toxic to the 
microorganism. The control of phytopathogenic fungi is of great 
economic importance since fungal growth on plants or on 
parts of plants, e.g., fruits blossoms, foliage, stems, 
tubers, roots, etc., inhibits production of foliage, fruit 
or seed and reduces the overall quantity and quality of the 
harvested crop. The continuous economic toll taken by 
phytopathogenic fungi establishes a continuing need to 
develop new, more effective fungicides which possess 
curative, preventive and systemic action to protect 
cultivated plants and the seeds from which they develop. 
Those requirements must be accomplished without any 
significant adverse side effects to the plants of the 
desired crops. Compositions containing dried bacteria and 
agricultural chemicals nave been employed to pre-treat or 
pre-inoculate seeds. However these compositions have 
sometimes exhibited reduced bacterial activity over time,  
 
presumably as a result of the degradative effects of the 
chemical component on the biological component. Such 
compositions have even been found to lack virtually all 
bacterial activity despite having been formulated with an 
adequate quantity of bacteria. For this reason, it has been 
the practice to apply a chemical fungicide such as captan, 
thiram, carboxin, metalaxyl, quintozene (PCNB), and the like 
to the seed well in advance of planting, but to only apply 
Bacillus subtilis endospores a known seed inoculant (e.g., 
Quantum-4000Â® HB biological inoculant available from 
Gustafson, Inc., Plano, Texas) to the seed just before 
planting on the premise that a reduced period of exposure of 
the Bacillus subtilis endospores to the chemical fungicide 
will minimize any loss of bioeffectiveness of the spores. It has now been surprisingly discovered that a 
pre-mix composition comprising Bacillussubtilis and 
chemical fungicide will experience little loss of bio-effectiveness 
even after relatively long periods of storage, 
e.g., from 2 to 12 months and
