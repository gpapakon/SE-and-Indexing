<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the invention is a device for sealing against leaks to the atmosphere from a steam turbine, of the type including a rotor (2) located in a chamber (1), means (3) for sealing against steam at each point where the rotor (2) leaves the said chamber (1) and means (4) for supporting the rotor (2) at each of its ends, these latter means being formed by oil bearings including a cap (5) and means (6) for sealing the point where the rotor (2) passes through each of the said bearings (4). The device includes means (10) for overpressurising each zone delimited, where the rotor (2) passes through, by the chamber (1) of the turbine and by the cap (5) of the adjacent bearing (4) so as to seal against leaks of steam and/or oil throughout the operation of the said turbine.

Sealing device for leaks of steam and/or oil to the
atmosphere from a steam turbine, of the type comprising:


a rotor (2) disposed in a chamber (1);
sealing means (3) for the steam at the level of
the outlet for each rotor (2) from said chamber (1),
means (4) of supporting the rotor (2) at each of
its ends, formed by oil bearings comprising a lid

(5) and means (6) of sealing the oil at the level
where the rotor (2) passes into each of said

bearings (4),
means (10) of generating high pressure by
aspiration of air so as to seal any leakage of steam

   and/or of oil during operation of said turbine,
characterised in that the means (10) of generating high

pressure are formed by grooves (12) functioning by means
of centripetal effect, disposed in a plane perpendicular

to the axis of the rotor (2), and facing the chamber (91)
of the turbine and/or of the lid (5) of the adjacent

bearing (4), and each comprising a head end (12c) opening
on to an external circumference and a foot end (12d)

opening on to an internal circumference, said
circumferences being concentric.
