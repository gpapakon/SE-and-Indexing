<DESCRIPTION>
 Triazole Substituted Quinoline Derivatives.The invention is related to pharmaceutical compositions for protection and treatment of lesions of gastrointestinal mu¬ cous membrans and having secretion inhibiting and cytopro¬ tective activity- More particularly the invention is related to pharmaceutical compositions containing as active ingre¬ dient certain quinoline derivatives and their salts in a biologically effective quantity optionally together with other active pharmaceutical ingredients, processes for their preparation and methods of treatment to use them alone or in combination with other pharmaceutically active ingre¬ dients.In this specification the substituents of varying interpre¬ tation stand always for the following:-R1 stands for a 1-triazolyl-group in position 2 or 4, or a 3-triazolyl-thio-group or a 5-/Cι-4-alkyl/-3-triazolyl-thio-group, -R2 stands for a hydrogen atom in position 3 or optionally in position 2 or for a Cι-4-alkyl-group, -R3 stands for a hydrogen atom or a Cι-4-alkyl-group, -X stands for a hydrogen or halogen-atom or for a C1-4- alkyl group- It is accepted knowledge that peptic ulcer of the upper di¬ gestive tract is caused as a result of a disequilibrium between the defensive factors (force of mucosal resistance) and agressive factors (gastric acid and pepsin secretion) /e.g. Nature 236, 358,1972/. Pharmaceuticals inhibiting secretion are well known. Part of them are anticholinergs and histamine H2~receptor antagonists such as e.g. cimeti- din, ranitidine, famotidin, others are potassium ATP-ase in¬ hibitors such as omeprasole. These drugs are effective against gastric and intestinal ulcer however on terminating their administration the ulcers reappear in a high ratio of patients especially in cases where the patients do not re¬ ceive antiacidic drugs (Med.Res.Rev.10. , 1, 1990). Another possibility to fight against ulcer resides in the intensification of the protective factors. Protective mecha¬ nism is accomplished through the mucosal barrier which pro- 

tects the gastric mucous membran from the noxious ef¬ fects of the luminal pepsin and hydrogen ions. The protecti¬ on stands under a multifactoral control: a mucous protective layer covering the gastric mu¬ cous membran which ensures a non-mixing layer on the surface, - bicarbonate secretion, causing a pH-change between the lumen of the stomach (pH=2,0) and the center of the mucous membran cells (pH=7), regeneration of the mucous membran and blood supply from the submucosa. All four of the above are influenced by the
