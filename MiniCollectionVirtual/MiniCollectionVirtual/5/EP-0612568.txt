<ABSTRACT>
A strip formed at least partly of elastomeric material 
has at least a portion (9) of its surface coloured by 

application of a coloured spray coating. In order to 
provide a distinct boundary between coloured and uncoloured 

portions of the strip an integral tear-off bead (11) projecting 
outwardly from the surface may be provided with the coloured 

spray coating being applied to one side thereof only. If 
desired, two different coloured coatings (9e,9f) may be applied, one 

to either side of the bead (11). The strip is particularly 
suited for use as a vehicle weatherseal and may, therefore, 

be of composite construction with a flange gripping (3) portion 
and a sealing portion (1). The spray coating preferably 

consists of a polyurethane based finish utilising a blend of 
individual components which adheres to the surface of the 

strip yet maintains the strip's flexibility.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to coloured extruded strips, 
and particularly to spray coated weatherseals, and to their 
method of manufacture. The invention also extends to 
products made up from extruded strips, and while the 
invention is particularly concerned with weatherseals, it is 
not so limited. Traditionally, the majority of weatherseals have been 
produced from black polymeric material, e.g. rubber, or from 
an extruded plastics of a neutral colour. However, in the 
motor and building industries, there is now a requirement 
that weatherseals are coloured to match or contrast with the 
colour finish of the vehicle or building in which they are 
used. In the past, coloured seals have been provided by 
using a coloured cloth which overlies a black base material, 
these are expensive to manufacture. Traditionally, in the motor industry, coloured 
plastics edge trims or U-shaped flange gripping strips in 
which a carrier may be located, are often combined with 
elastomeric dynamic sealing bulbs or lips which are normally 
black, the elastomeric material providing the correct degree 
of elasticity, as this cannot be achieved with extruded 
plastics materials. In the motor industry, there is now considerable 
reluctance to use plastics materials, such as PVC which can 
be extruded in almost any chosen colour, for door seals and 
the like because they are toxic and could be dangerous in a 
fire. Accordingly, there is now a desire to make edge 
trims, seals and combination seals incorporating edge trims 
entirely of elastomeric material. While it is possible to 
extrude elastomeric material in selected colours, these are 
expensive and traditionally the seals are black. 
Unfortunately, however, black seals and combination 
trim/seals are becoming less and less acceptable to motor 
car manufacturers who prefer the seals to be colour matched  
 
to either the interior trim and/or to the external paintwork 
of the vehicle. It is, however, recognised that it is not 
easy to paint or otherwise to colour black elastomeric 
material in a cost-effective manner. The present invention seeks to overcome this problem. According to the present invention, we provide a strip 
formed at least partly of elastomeric material wherein at 
least a portion of a surface of the strip has a surface 
layer thereon applied by spray coating, the surface layer 
being of a selected colour and being flexible. The strip 
may be a weather seal, e.g. for a motor vehicle. The seal may be formed with an integral tear-off bead 
projecting

<CLAIMS>
A strip formed at least partly of elastomeric material 
wherein at least a portion of a surface of the strip has a 

surface layer thereon applied by spray coating, the surface 
layer being of a selected colour and being flexible. 
A strip according to claim 1 which comprises an 
extruded weather seal for a motor vehicle. 
A strip according to claim 1 or 2 which is formed with 
an integral tear-off bead projecting outwardly from the 

surface thereof, the bead providing a boundary line between 
the surface coated area of the strip and a non-coated area. 
A strip according to claim 3 wherein two different 
coating materials are applied to the strip, one to each side 

of the bead. 
A strip according to claim 3 or 4 wherein the bead is 
of substantial width and connected to the strip at two 

spaced points by tear-strips so that when the bead is torn 
away from the strip an uncoated area remains. 
A strip according to any one of the preceding claims, 
which is of composite construction comprising a dynamic 

sealing portion adhered to a static carrier portion and the 
spray coating is applied to a surface area thereof bridging 

the boundary between the two portions. 
A strip according to any one of the preceding claims 
wherein the spray coating consists of a polyurethane based 

finish utilising a blend of individual components providing 
flexibility and adhesion to all relevant substrates in the 

strip. 
A strip substantially as hereinbefore described with 
reference to the accompanying drawings. 
A method of forming a coloured strip or a coloured 
component made from extruded strip material, wherein a 

selected surface area of the strip or component is coloured 
by spray coating. 
A method according to claim 9 and substantially as 
hereinbefore described with reference to the accompanying 

drawings.
