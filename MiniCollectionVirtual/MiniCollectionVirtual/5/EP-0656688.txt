<ABSTRACT>
A first basic clock supplied from outside is delayed by a first delay 
circuit to generate a second basic clock which is fed to a frequency 

divider to generate a group of multi-phase clocks, each of which has a 
clock width equal to an integer number multiple of the clock width of said 

second basic clock and has a phase delay sequentially by a value equal to 
an integer number multiple of the clock period of said second basic clock, 

wherein the (n-1)th multi-phase clock and a nth multi-phase clock 
neighboring to each other in the phase sequence, and said first basic 

clock, are fed to a delay generating circuit as inputs, which comprises a 
second delay circuit for delaying the (n-1)th clock in the phase sequence, 

and a circuit arrangement for generating an output clock phase having a 
delay time relative to said nth clock, being equal to an smaller value of 

one half clock width of the first basic clock minus a delay time of the 
first delay circuit and a delay time of said second delay circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a clock generating circuit and, more
particularly, to such a circuit generating a plurality of clock signals in
response to a reference clock signal.In a digital signal processing apparatus, typified by a
micro-computer, multi-phase clocks are employed as clocks for providing
generating timings to respective internal circuits to establish
synchronization thereamong. Each of the multi-phase clocks is produced by
frequency-dividing a reference (or master) clock CL. Referring to Fig. 6, as an example, four-phase clocks Φ1, Φ2, Φ3
and Φ4 are derived from a reference clock CL. Specifically, the
reference clock CL has a predetermined rate of frequency indicated by one
cycle period 41, and the four clocks Φ1, Φ2, Φ3 and Φ4, each of which
is derived by frequency-dividing the reference clock CL, have respective
active widths 42 each equal to the clock cycle period 41 of the reference
clock CL and respective phases shifted from one another one cycle by one
cycle of the reference clock CL as shown in Fig. 5. Thus a given one of
the four-phase clocks has the falling edge that coincides with the rising
edge timing of a succeeding one of them.In a micro-computer fabricated on a single semiconductor chip, there
inevitably exists difference in interconnection resistance or
interconnection capacity from one interconnection of the clock
distribution circuit to another. Consequently, should the clocks, each of
which is derived by frequency-dividing a reference clock in the above
mentioned manner be directly distributed among respective circuits, there
are produced differences in delay time between clocks distributed, as a
result of which these clocks are overlapped with one another by a certain
time length to thereby cause a circuit malfunction.For overcoming such problem, the conventional practice in a
micro-computer is to produce newly a group of clocks CK1 to CK4, which
are shown in Fig. 17 and arranged to have narrower active widths, from
the frequency-divided clocks Φ1 to Φ4 and to employ the group of these
newly generated non-overlapping clocks. With the newly produced clock 
group, since there is a timing interval between the active period of a
given clock and the active period of the succeeding clock, that is a
clock-to-clock delay 72, there is no risk of clock overlap within the
circuit of the micro-computer employing such clock group.Such non-overlapping four-phase clocks CK1, CK2, CK3 and CK4 are
generated by a circuit as shown in Fig. 15. Note that Fig. 15 indicates
a circuit portion
