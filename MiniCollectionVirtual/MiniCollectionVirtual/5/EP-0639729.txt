<ABSTRACT>
Slider-crank driving mechanism for the transformation of a reciprocating motion into a rotary motion or vice versa for the achievement of a higher efficiency by providing at least two plates (6) which move alternately towards one another and each of which has a guide slot (5) which is directed obliquely to the zero point line (S) and which describes a curve towards one end to form a long tail extending at right angles to the zero point line (S) and towards the other end to form a short tail extending at right angles to the zero point line (S), and by providing a crankshaft, the crankpins (3) of which extend through the guide slots (5).
