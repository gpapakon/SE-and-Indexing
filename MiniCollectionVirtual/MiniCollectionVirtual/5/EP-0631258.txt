<ABSTRACT>
Method and device for automatically changing of the 
operating conditions of machines and apparatus.

 
The method is characterised by: 


a) the production on a laminar medium of marks 
which are coded in accordance with values of 

the setting or configuration parameters of 
the machine or apparatus; 
b) supplying the laminar medium with the marks 
made to an automatic reading head of the 

machine; 
c) automatic reading of the graphic signals 
produced on the laminar medium by means of 

the reader head incorporated in the machine 
control components; 
d) transmitting the result of reading to the 
system microprocessor; 
e) comparing the values read of the computer 
memory, which containing the equivalents of  

 
the parameter values; and 
f) emitting instructions by part of the 
microprocessor to the machine components 

which the operating conditions depend of the 
parameters values.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and
device for automatically changing the operating
conditions in various types of machines and apparatus.As is known, the operating conditions of
machines and apparatus, also known as a whole as
"configurations", depend on the specific values which
are assigned to the different parameters coming into
play in the functioning of the machine or apparatus in
question. Thus, for example, the operating conditions
of a machine-tool can be given as the velocity of the
plate supporting the workpiece, the velocity of linear
displacement of the tools, the number of tools, the
linear path of the tools, and many other factors. In
machines such as graph-plotting apparatus, the
parameters to be varied may be the language, the
graphic language characteristics, the page format, the
type of pens to be used, and other. In other types of
machines, the operating conditions depend on specific
parameters relating to the operating characteristics
of the machine itself. The variation of the values of the different
parameters defining the "configuration" of the machine
are performed by different types of means available to
the user, which are conventionally known as the user
interface in the case of electronic machines and
apparatus.In general, the process for setting the
values of the parameters regulating the operating
conditions is performed by assemblies consisting of a
display screen and associated keyboard constituting
the user interface. A series of menus can be
represented on the screen and the user can follow the
menus and submenus using the keyboard and can select
the most convenient options. Conventionally, the
screens consist of two lines of 16 characters or two
lines of 20 characters, although screens with larger
dimensions can also be used, notwithstanding the
question of cost.This process of setting by the user is
difficult to the necessary time for performing the
process and to the relative difficulty of its
realization, since the two-line screen cannot usually
provide all the information necessary for the user to
be able to know the operating conditions of the 
apparatus and the actions to be performed in order to
vary them. The user is therefore obliged to perform a
number of successive steps via the screen until he
discovers completely the actual configuration or
setting of the apparatus or machine until complete the
new setting or configuration desired.JP-A-02 179 799 discloses a method for entering operating parameters

Method of altering the values of a plurality of setting parameters which
determine the operating conditions of an apparatus comprising the followings steps:


a) applying to a user form provided on a laminar medium (5), first marks (6)
which are respectively coded in accordance with values of said plurality of setting parameters

of the apparatus;
b) supplying said laminar medium (5) with said marks (6) to an automatic
reader head (1) of the apparatus;
c) reading said marks (6) applied on the laminar medium (5) with the reader
head (1) of the apparatus;
d) altering the values of said plurality of setting parameters based on the
result obtained by said reading step.
Method as claimed in claim 1, which, prior to said applying step, further
comprises the step of producing, with the apparatus, on said laminar medium (5) a said user form

for altering said plurality of setting parameters, wherein such first marks (6) are applied on said
user form.
A method as claimed in claim 2, wherein the step of producing said user
form comprises the further step of producing on said user form, second marks (6) which are

respectively coded in accordance with the current values of said plurality of setting parameters
of the apparatus.
A method as claimed in claim 2 or 3 wherein the said user form has a
plurality of zones (13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19), each zone being associated with at least one of

the setting parameters and each zone having different reference areas (20) respectively
representing different values for the setting parameters of said zone, said marks (6) marking

certain reference areas (20).
A method as claimed in claim 4 wherein said marks (6) are applied on
said user form by shading said reference areas (20).
