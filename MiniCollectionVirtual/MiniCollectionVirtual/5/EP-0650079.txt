<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical compensatory
sheet employable for compensating phase difference
of a liquid crystal cell, and a liquid crystal display provided
with the optical compensatory sheet.As a display for electronic office system-devices such
as a desk-top personal computer and a word processor for
Japanese language, CRT (cathode ray tube) has been employed
so far. Recently, a liquid crystal display (hereinafter
referred to as LCD) is increasingly employed instead of the
CRT because of its thin thickness, light weight and low
power consumption. LCD generally has a structure that a
liquid crystal cell is disposed between a pair of polarizing
sheets. Most of LCD use a twisted nematic liquid crystal
or a super twisted nematic liquid crystal.A super twisted nematic liquid crystal display
(hereinafter referred to as STN-LCD) has been recently
utilized for dot-matrix type liquid crystal displays such
as those of word processors and personal computers. The
liquid crystal display generally has a structure that a
liquid crystal cell is disposed between a pair of polarizing
sheets. The STN-LCD uses a super twisted nematic
liquid crystal showing a twisted angle of 180 to 270
degrees. Such STN-LCD has an advantage of showing a high
contrast on high multiplexing drive, compared with the conventional
twisted nematic liquid crystal display (twisted 
angle: 90 degrees) which can be utilized for the dot-matrix
type liquid crystal displays.However, the STN-LCD has a disadvantage of giving a
displayed image inherently colored with the hue from blue
or yellow owing to elliptically polarized light transmitted
through STN liquid crystal cell. This phenomenon may be
hereinafter referred to as coloring. In the STN-LCD, high
contrast cannot be obtained in black-and-white display and
it is difficult to obtain color image.In order to avoid the coloring of the displayed image,
there have been proposed a liquid crystal display having
one or three layers of optically anisotropic body (that is,
NTN mode-display) and a liquid crystal display using a uniaxial
stretched polymer film (that is, FTN mode-display).The former NTN mode-display shows excellent characteristics
in black-and-white display. The liquid crystal cell
for optically anisotropic body used in the NTN mode-display
is voluminous and a plurality of such cells are required,
so that the NTN mode-display is large in volume and weight,
and high in production cost compared with the FTN mode-display
using a uniaxial stretched polymer film. Hence,
the uniaxial
