<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to poly(1,4-cyclohexylenedimethylene 
terephthalate) (PCT) compositions with 
improved crystallization characteristics due to the 
presence of a high molecular weight aliphatic polyester. 
Specifically, the invention is directed to PCT 
compositions containing an aliphatic polyester with a 
number-average molecular weight of greater than 22,000. Polyalkylene terephthalate resins are used for 
manufacturing fibers, films, and molded articles that 
have excellent physical properties such as high wear 
resistance, durability, and heat resistance. The 
physical properties can be further improved by 
incorporating reinforcing materials such as glass fibers 
into polyalkylene terephthalate resin compositions. An important class of polyalkylene terephthalate 
resins are the PCT resins based on reactions between 
1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol and terephthalic acid or 
suitable synthetic equivalents. Glass fiber reinforced 
PCT compositions having high crystallinity have 
excellent properties with regard to strength, stiffness, 
and heat resistance. These PCT compositions are 
particularly suitable for the manufacture of heavy duty 
molded parts for use in the automotive and electronic 
industries. High crystallinity is essential to ensure adequate 
hardness, strength, and heat resistance at elevated 
temperatures. In addition, high crystallinity should be 
arrived at as rapidly as possible to achieve optimum  
 
material properties and rapid molding cycles. To ensure 
adequate crystallinity, PCT compositions generally 
require mold temperatures of 150째C. or higher. High 
mold temperatures are possible only with sophisticated 
molding equipment and require specialized heating means, 
such as, for example, oil bath heating units which are 
beyond the equipment capabilities of many mold shops 
which have only water heated molds. Water heated molds 
are normally capable of temperatures no higher than 
110째C. Oil heating units, in contrast, are expensive to 
purchase and to operate. Crystallization aids have been suggested as a 
method of promoting crystallization at lower mold 
temperatures. The use of ester compounds as 
crystallization aids is described, for example, in 
European patent application 387,398 and in U.S. Pat. 
Nos. 3,565,852, 4,223,125 and 4,223,113. European 
patent application 387,398 discloses the use of 
aliphatic polyesters as crystallization aids for 
polyethylene terephthalate compositions. The European 
application states that faster crystallization rates 
result from the
