<ABSTRACT>
Input image data is stored in a register matrix of 7 × 
7 
in a successive manner. A pattern detecting section detects 
a black- or white-pixel connective pattern of the reference 

pixels of a marked pixel. When the reference pixel pattern is 
a black-pixel connective pattern of 1 : n (n = 1, 2, 3, ...), 

an enlarging/smoothing processor section interpolates a part of 
the enlarged marked pixel with black pixels. When it is a 

white-pixel connective pattern of 1 : n (n = 1, 2, 3, ...), the 
enlarging/smoothing processor erases a part of the enlarged 

marked pixel. As a result, the oblique line can be smoothed. 
The line that is made thick by the smoothing process can be 

shaped into a thin line. Thus, a high-quality image can be 
produced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an enlarging/smoothing 
processor for enlarging and smoothing image data, and more 
particularly to an enlarging/smoothing processor capable of 
shaping reproduced characters and figures so as to take natural 
forms. In the field of the image processing technology, the 
technique to enlarge original image data and to print out the 
enlarged image data by a printer has been put into practical 
use. When the image data is simply enlarged, notches appear on 
oblique portions of characters and figures. The notches impair 
the print picture quality. To avoid this picture quality 
deterioration, the process for removing the notches, viz., 
smoothing process, is indispensable. There are proposed some smoothing techniques as 
disclosed in Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication Nos. Sho. 
60-11885 and Hei. 1-208154. In the most popular facsimile machine of G3 mode, two 
resolutions are applied for the received image data under the 
recommendation of CCITT (International Telegraph and Telephone 
Consultative Committee); one is a standard resolution of 8 
pixels/mm × 3.85 lines/mm and the other, a high resolution of 
8 pixels/mm × 7.7 lines/mm.  Further, the facsimile machines of high resolution and 
high line densities are recently marketed. In some facsimile 
machines of G3 mode, 16 pixels/mm × 15.4 lines/mm, and in some 
facsimile machines of G4 mode, a plurality of resolutions are 
used, which are selected from among 200 dpi, 240 dpi, 300 dpi 
and 400 dpi. The facsimile machine with a plurality of resolutions 
contains a recording device of a higher resolution. To record 
such image data as to have a resolution lower than that of the 
recording device, the image data is enlarged before recorded. 
The reason for this is that if the image data of low 
resolution is recorded as it is by the high resolution 
recording device, the image is recorded in the reduced form. For example, when the received image data of the 
standard resolution, 8 pixels/mm × 3.85 lines/mm, is recorded 
by a recording device of 400 dpi, the image is halved in the 
fast scan direction and is quartered in the slow scan 
direction. Accordingly, to record the received image data of 
the resolution, 8 pixels/mm × 3.85 lines/mm, by a recording 
device of 400 dpi, the received image data must be enlarged to 
be approximately two times as large as the original one in the 
fast scan direction, and to be approximately four times in the 
slow scan direction. The technique to record the image data of low 
resolution
