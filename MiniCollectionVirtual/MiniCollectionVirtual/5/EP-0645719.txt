<ABSTRACT>
A correlation detector capable of obtaining a more 
correct and natural correlation value. The correlation 

detector outputs a correlation value representative of 
autocorrelation in accordance with a sum (r + ra) of the 

number 
r
 of consecutive autocorrelated data items before 
one timing and the number 
ra
 of consecutive 
autocorrelated data items after the one timing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a correlation detector
for outputting a degree of autocorrelation of a digital signal
obtained by sampling and quantizing an analog signal. A degree
of autocorrelation corresponds to the number of consecutive
samples each of which has a substantially identical quantized
level.A correlation detector for detecting a degree of
correlation of an input signal has generally a circuit
structure such as shown in Fig. 7. An input signal is sampled
by a sampling pulse having a frequency F, and a
presence/absence of autocorrelation between data of the input
signal at one timing and at a timing immediately before the
one timing is detected by an autocorrelation detector circuit
1. 
(A presence of autocorrelation between two data samples means
that two data samples have a substantially identical quantized
level, and reversely an absence of autocorrelation between the
means that they have different quantized levels). In
accordance with the detection results, an autocorrelation
counter 2 counts the number r of consecutive autorelated date
items (i.e. the number r of consecutive samples having a
substantially identical quantized level) before one timing of
the input signal. A value D0 corresponding to the output r of
the autocorrelation counter 2 is outputted as a correlation
value.The operation of the conventional correlation detector
shown in Fig. 7 will be described. The autocorrelation
detector circuit (SREL) 1 is supplied 
with an input signal IN sampled at a clock ck such as
shown in Fig.6. A presence/absence of autocorrelation
between data of the input signal at one timing and at a
timing immediately before the one timing is detected, and
the detection result is outputted as a correlation
presence/absence signal f which is inputted to the
autocorrelation counter 2. The length of the H level of
the signal f is outputted as the count signal r from the
autocorrelation counter 2 which is inputted to an encoder
5. The encoder 5 outputs D0 = 0 for 0 ≤ r ≤ 1, D0 = 1
for 2 ≤ r ≤ 4, and D0 = 2 for 5 ≤ r.There is a one clock delay when D0 is outputted.
Therefore, the input signal IN is delayed by one clock to
obtain a delayed input signal IND which is compared with
the signal D0. At a timing α1 of the signal IND, three
consecutive autocorrelated data items are present before
the timing α1, and so r = 3 at α1. Five consecutive
autocorrelated data items are present before a timing α2,
and so r = 5 at α2. The signal r is inputted to the
encoder 5 which outputs a value corresponding to the
valu
