<ABSTRACT>
Socket fittings (4) for attaching a lamp socket (5) 
to a lamp holder (3) attached to a top portion of a pole 

(1) erected in a park or a public square include an 
attachment plate (17) formed in a substantially 

inverted-U shape and having a surface center portion 
(17a) and a reverse surface center portion (17b), 

attaching screws (16a, 16b) for attaching the attachment 
plate to the lamp holder, and fixing screws (18a, 18b) 

for fixing the lamp socket to one of the surface center 
portion and the reverse surface center portion in accordance 

with intended use. Where the lamp socket (5) is 
attached to the surface center portion (17a) of the 

attachment plate (17) with the reverse surface center 
portion (17b) directed downward, a lamp (6) screwed in 

the lamp socket (5) is positioned at its high level. On 
the other hand, where the lamp socket (5) is attached to 

the reverse surface center portion (17b) of the attachment 
plate (17) with the surface center portion (17a) 

directed downward, the lamp (6) screwed in the lamp 
socket (5) is positioned at its low level.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an illuminating device 
for illuminating a park, a public square, etc. In general, an illuminating device for illuminating 
a park, a public square, etc. includes a pole erected in 
the park or the public square, a lamp holder attached 
to a top portion of the pole, and a lamp socket 
attached to the holder by means of socket fittings. In 
this illuminating device, light emitted from a lamp 
screwed into the lamp socket is reflected obliquely 
downward by a reflector located above the lamp holder, 
and the reflected light passes through a globe interposed 
between the reflector and the lamp holder, thereby 
illuminating the space about the pole. Since in the above illuminating device, a part of 
light emitted from the lamp directly enters the globe 
and then spreads from the globe in the horizontal 
direction, it can illuminate a large space and hence is 
suitable to illuminating a gay place. However, the feature 
that light from the lamp directly enters the globe 
and spreads horizontally is not suitable to illuminating 
a park or a public square adjacent to a residential 
quarter. It is an object of the invention to provide 
an illuminating device capable of reducing or increasing 
the degree of expansion of light which has passed a 
globe employed therein, with the use of a simple  
 
structure. It is another object of the invention to provide an 
illuminating device capable of varying the degree of 
expansion of light which has passed the globe, in accordance 
with a place in which the lamp is installed. To attain the objects, there is provided an illuminating 
device for illuminating a park, a public square, 
etc., comprising: a pole erected in the park, the 
public square, etc.; a lamp holder attached to the pole; 
a lamp socket secured to the lamp holder by means or 
socket fittings; a reflector located above the lamp 
holder for reflecting downward obliquely light emitted 
from a lamp connected to the lamp socket; and a globe 
provided between the reflector and the lamp holder for 
allowing the light emitted from the lamp to spread to 
the outside. The socket fittings include an attachment 
plate formed in a substantially inverted-U shape and 
having a surface center portion and a reverse surface 
center portion, attaching screws for attaching the 
attachment plate to the lamp holder, and fixing screws 
for fixing the lamp socket to one of the surface center 
portion and the reverse surface center portion in accordance 
with intended use. This invention can be more

<CLAIMS>
An illuminating device for illuminating a park, 
a public square, etc., including: 

   a pole (1) erected in the park, the public square, 
etc.; 

   a lamp holder (3) attached to the pole; 
   a lamp socket (5) secured to the lamp holder by 

means of socket fittings (4); 
   a reflector (7) located above the lamp holder for 

reflecting downward obliquely light emitted from a lamp 
(6) connected to the lamp socket; and 

   a globe (14) provided between the reflector and the 
lamp holder for allowing the light emitted from the lamp 

to spread to the outside; 
   characterized in that the socket fittings include 

an attachment plate (17) formed in a substantially 
inverted-U shape and having a surface center portion 

(17a) and a reverse surface center portion (17b), 
attaching screws (16a, 16b) for attaching the attachment 

plate to the lamp holder, and fixing screws (18a, 18b) 
for fixing the lamp socket to one of the surface center 

portion and the reverse surface center portion in accordance 
with intended use. 
The illuminating device according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the lamp holder includes a cylindrical 

portion having an upper end and mounted on a 
tip portion of the lamp pole, and a socket receiving 

portion formed continuous from the upper end of the 
cylindrical portion. 
The illuminating device according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the socket receiving portion is 

formed substantially cylindrical, and has a level higher 
than the level of the lamp assumed when the lamp is 

screwed into the lamp socket fixed to the reverse surface 
center portion of the attachment plate. 
The illuminating device according to claim 1, 
 

characterized in that the attachment plate has a hole
