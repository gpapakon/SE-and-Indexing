<ABSTRACT>
Sheet-like structures comprising a polymer having a main chain and side groups branching off from the main chain (side-group polymer) which has the following structural features (1) to (3):   (1) the side-group polymer contains at least one photoinducible side group of variable configuration; (2) the side-group polymer contains at least one permanently shape-anisotropic side group of high anisotropy of the molecular polarisability which is different from (1); (3) the side-group polymer contains flexible spacer groups between the main chain and side groups (1) and (2); where the sheet-like structure, in the glass state of the side-group polymers, is optically isotropic, transparent, non-scattering and amorphous before irradiation and transparent and, through a reversible light-induced (photoinduced) alignment of the side groups (1) and (2) in the glass state, long-term birefringent and dichroic after radiation, can be modified in their optical properties in a targeted way by the action of light.

and side groups branching off the backbone (side group

polymer), which polymer has the following structural
features (1) to (3):

photoinducibly configuration-changing side group;

permanently conformationally anisotropic side

group with high anisotropy of molecular
polarisability which differs from (1);

groups between the backbone and the side groups

characterised in that
 the flat material in the glassy
state of the side group polymers is optically

isotropic, transparent, non-scattering and amorphous

group polymer do not form liquid crystalline

phases;

groups (5) which do not exhibit permanent

conformational anisotropy.
