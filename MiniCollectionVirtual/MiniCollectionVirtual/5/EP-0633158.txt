<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device and a method for starting a vehicle which is driven by an electric drive unit which is supplied with electric energy from a fuel cell. A compressor which is driven by an electric motor which is supplied with voltage from the fuel cell itself is arranged in the feed line of the fuel cell for the oxidant flow. According to the invention it is proposed to provide additionally a starter motor for activating the fuel cell for driving the compressor, the said starter motor being fed by a 12V starter battery. In addition, it is proposed to start a safety interrogation before the activation of the vehicle. The fuel cell is not powered up to a prescribed idling power with the aid of the starter motor until the safety interrogation has been successfully terminated. After this idling power is reached, the drive unit is then enabled.

<CLAIMS>
Vehicle having an electric drive unit and having 
a fuel cell (1) in whose feed line a compressor (8) 

driven with the aid of an electric motor (10) is arranged 
for the purpose of compressing the oxidant mass flow, the 

drive unit and the electric motor (10) for the compressor 
(8) being supplied with electrical energy from the fuel 

cell (1), characterized in that in order to drive the 
compressor (8) additional provision is made of a starter 

motor (9) which is supplied with voltage from a starter 
battery (41). 
Method for starting a vehicle according to 
Claim 1, characterized 


in that a safety interrogation is started after the 
start of the method, 
in that after successful termination of the safety 
interrogation, the fuel cell (1) is started with the 

aid of the starter motor (9), and 
in that not until the fuel cell (1) has reached a 
prescribed no-load power (p
min
) is the electric 
motor (10) activated, the starter motor (9) 

deactivated and the drive unit (17) released. 
Method according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the safety interrogation is started by opening a 

vehicle door. 
Method according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the safety interrogation is interrupted until the 

gas sensors arranged in the vehicle have reached their 
operating temperature, and in that the safety 

interrogation is terminated as soon as the gas sensors 
deliver regular signals.  

 
Method according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the cooling water pump of the fuel cell (1) is not 

switched on until after the no-load power (p
min
) has been 
reached. 
Method according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that a valve (3) is opened at the start of the starting 

procedure, and the driver is subsequently instructed by 
the activation of a warning lamp to purge the exhaust 

line (13). 
Method according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that after acknowledgement of the warning signal by 

the driver a purge valve (14) is opened for a prescribed 
period.
