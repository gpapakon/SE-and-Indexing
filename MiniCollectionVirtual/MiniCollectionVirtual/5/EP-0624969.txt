<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image formation 
processing system which performs image formation processing of 
an image forming apparatus such as an electrophotographic 
copying machine. Generally, an image forming apparatus such as an electrophotographic 
copying machine includes an operation portion. 
Image formation processing is performed in response to a user's 
operation of a key on the operation portion. However, to 
improve the function of the electrophotographic copying machine, 
a system may be useful in which an original image read out by a 
scanner is processed through a terminal such as a personal 
computer and the processing result is printed out through the 
copying machine. In this case, however, it is necessary for the 
user to go over to the copying machine to push the printing key 
of the copying machine after operating the terminal. An object of the present invention is to remove this 
inconvenience to improve the use and function of an image 
forming apparatus. Another object of the present invention is to provide an 
image formation processing system wherein communication is 
performed with an image forming apparatus through a workstation  
 
so that operations such as image formation and printing are 
performed on the workstation. A further object of the present invention is to provide an 
image processing system wherein an image forming operation is 
performed while a display on an image forming apparatus is 
viewed substantially on the workstation. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide 
an image formation processing system wherein a control based on 
a command transmitted from the workstation is set on the image 
forming apparatus without failure. To achieve the above-mentioned objects, an image formation 
system of the present invention is provided with the following: 
an image forming unit; an operation portion provided in the 
image forming unit and including a central processing unit 
capable of controlling image formation by the image forming unit 
based on an input data; an image processing unit including a 
central processing unit; and a workstation connected to the 
operation portion through the image processing unit. Data 
communication can be performed between the workstation and the 
image processing unit and between the image processing unit and 
the operation portion, and an image formation processing by the 
image forming unit can be controlled based on a command generated 
by operating the workstation. According to such features, the
