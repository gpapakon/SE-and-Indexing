<ABSTRACT>
A photographic liquid processing station (14) comprising at least 
two sections (15, 16) through which a photographic sheet material is 

passed in succession, the processing liquid being fed through said 
sections in countercurrent, replenishing means (67) which comprises 

discharge means (70) for carrying off rinsing liquid from the first 
section (15) in response to the amount of processed film, pump means 

(63) for feeding liquid from the second section (16) to the first one 
(15) in response to a level sensor (61) in the first section, and a 

liquid level sensor (64) in the last section (16) for controlling said 
replenishing means (67).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a photographic liquid processing
station, more in particular to a washing/rinsing station with several
processing sections, the liquid flow through the different sections
being in a countercurrent to the direction of transport of a sheet
material through the station.It is known in the art to perform the rinsing of a silver halide
photographic material which has been developed and fixed, by means of
a rinsing station which comprises two or more rinsing tanks through
which the material is passed in succession, the rinsing liquid flowing
in countercurrent. The advantage is that the last rinsing tank will
contain almost fresh rinsing water so that silver effluent will be
small.Circulation of rinsing water in countercurrent is obtained through
overflow weirs separating the successive rinsing tanks. Replenishing
liquid is added to the last tank. A rinsing station of the described
kind is disclosed e.g. in EP 0 422 664 A2 of E.I. Du Pont de Nemours
and Cy, USA and in DE 41 05 916 A1 of Agfa-Gevaert AG, DE. A
disadvantage of liquid level control by means of a weir is the limited
precision of the level.If, for one reason or another, the liquid level of the last tank
is below that of its weir and a sensor asks for replenishing liquid,
it may take some time before the last tank is filled up to its weir.
Next starts the formation of a liquid meniscus on the weir. The size
of the meniscus may have to amount to 2-3 mm before liquid effectively
starts to overflow the weir. In the meantime, the liquid level in the
foregoing tanks may have dropped further as a consequence of its
carrying off by the processed material. The described phenomenon is
not detrimental to the rinsing as such of the material. However, there
are constructional features that may require a liquid level without
too much fluctuations. For instance, if the upper roller of each
transport roller pair for the sheet material only partly dips in the 
processing liquid, and the shafts of these upper rollers extend through
cut out portions of the lateral walls of the tanks for entering in
driving engagement with a drive gear, too high a level of the rinsing
liquid in the tank can cause leakage through such cut outs, whereas too
low a level will cause the upper rollers to run dry.The present invention has been developed in particular for the
washing and rinsing of multicolour proofs which are prepared
preparatory to printing. Colour proofs are required for inspection
and approval by the printer or his client before printing on

<CLAIMS>
Photographic liquid processing station (14) comprising at least
two sections (15, 16) through which a photographic sheet material is

passed in succession, the processing liquid being fed through said
sections in countercurrent, and replenishing means for adding

processing liquid to the last section, characterised in that it
comprises :


discharge means (70) for carrying off rinsing liquid from the
first section (15) in response to the amount of processed sheet

material,
pump means (63) for feeding liquid from the second section (16)
to the first one (15), in response to a level sensor (61) in the

first section, and pump means for feeding liquid from each next
to each preceding section in case the station comprises more than

two sections, and
a liquid level sensor (64) in the last section (16) for
controlling said replenishing means.
A photographic liquid processing station according to claim 1,
wherein said discharge means (70) is formed by a valve.
A photographic liquid processing station according to claim 1,
wherein said discharge means (70) is formed by a volumetric pump.
A photographic liquid processing station according to any of
claims 1 to 3, wherein said replenishing means is formed by a valve

(67) controlling a conduit (68) with pressurised processing liquid.
A photographic processing station according to any of claims 1
to 4, wherein said level sensors (61, 64) determine the same liquid

levels in the different sections.
