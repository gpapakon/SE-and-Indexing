<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a combination of ACE inhibitors 
and AII antagonists. More particularly the present invention concerns a combined 
pharmaceutical composition comprising a combination of at least one ACE 
(Angiotensin Converting Enzyme) inhibitor and at least one AII 
antagonist (Angiotensin II antagonist) for simultaneous, separate or 
sequential administration. According to the present invention, the angiotensin converting 
enzyme inhibitor can be in first dosage form and the AII antagonist is in a 
second dosage form, or preferably the angiotensin converting enzyme 
inhibitor and the AII antagonist can be in a single unit dosage. The composition of the present invention exhibits an enhanced 
effect on renal blood and can be used in a method of increasing renal 
blood flow rate in human. Renal selective effect is not present with the single entities alone. 
Angiotensin is produced by two pathways, one classical pathway and a 
non-classical pathway. ACE only blocks classical pathways, while the 
combination blocks both, producing a blockade thAT results in an 
enhanced renal dilation. Accordingly, the pharmaceutical composition of the present 
invention can also be used for the treatment or prevention of 
cardiovascular diseases. Particularly suitable as ACE inhibitors in the composition of the 
present invention the following drugs can be mentioned : enalapril, 
lisinopril, ceranapril, imidapril, captopril, DU-1777, zabicipril, utibapril, 
AB-47, cilazapril, zofenopril, fosinopril, delapril, spirapril, perindopril, 
libenzapril, moexipril, MDL-100240, quinapril, trandolapril, benazepril, 
quinaprilat, FPL-66564, Synecor, Prentyl, BIBS39, temocapril, idrapril, 
ramipril. As ACE inhibitor Enalapril, Lisinopril, Captopril, Ramipril, 
Cilazapril and Quinapril are preferred. Several non-peptide compounds have been described as A II 
antagonists suitable for the composition of the present invention. 
Illustrative of such compounds are those disclosed in U.S. Patents 4,207,324; 
4,340,598; 4,576,958; and 4,582,847 in European Patent Applications 028,834; 
245,637; 253,310; and 291,969; and in articles by A.T. Chiu, et al. (Eur. J.  
 
Pharm. Exp. Therap., 157, 13-21 (1988)) and by P.C. Wong, et al. (J; Pharm. 
Exp. Therap. 247, 1-7 (1988)). All of the U.S. Patents, European Patent 
Applications 028,834 and 253,310 and the two articles disclose substituted 
imidazole compounds which are generally bonded through a lower alkyl 
bridge to a substituted phenyl. European patent Application 245,637
