<ABSTRACT>
A sensor system is described for detecting the optical conditions at an interface (4) between a first medium (2) formed as a solid, and a second medium (3), the refractive indices of which are different. The sensor system has an optical unit comprising at least one emission unit (10) having at least one emission element (11), at least one detection unit (20) having at least one detection element (21), and an optical path (30) which connects the emission unit(s) to the detection unit(s). In this case, provision is made for a light-guide body (31) with a base face (32) and two optically active end faces (33, 34) to be arranged in the optical path, the base face of the light-guide body being fastened on the surface side (5) of the first medium located between the emission unit(s) and the interface. The first end face of the light-guide body faces the emission unit(s) and the second end face of the light-guide body faces the detection unit(s). The two end faces of the light-guide body, as well as the light-output face of the emission unit(s) and the light-input face of the detection unit(s) are formed in a predetermined convex shape.
