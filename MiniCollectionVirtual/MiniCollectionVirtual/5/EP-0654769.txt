<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for arming a radio alarm system, having a central alarm station (1), a plurality of detectors, these detectors being subdivided into two groups and the first group comprising detectors for securing the outside surface (outside skin, outside shell) and the second group comprising detectors for monitoring the interior space, and an additional closing device (2, 3) which is arranged on a closing door (main door) of an area to be monitored. According to the invention, the additional closing device (2, 3) is connected to a radio-transmitter unit (4) for radio-linking to the central alarm station (1), and on locking the additional closing device (2, 3) the detectors for securing the outside surface are armed. There is furthermore arranged, on the side of the additional closing device (2, 3) or of the radio-transmitter unit (4), a push-button switch or a switch (6), which is designed in such a manner that the switching state can be changed only when the additional closing device (2, 3) is open, and that in the case of a changed switching state of the switch or of the push-button switch (6) and on subsequent closing of the additional closing device (2, 3) all detectors are armed.

Device for setting a radio alarm system, having a
control centre (1), a plurality of detectors, said

detectors being divided into two groups, the first group
comprising perimeter security detectors and the second

group comprising internal surveillance detectors, and an
additional closure device (2, 3) which is disposed on a

terminal door of a surveillance area, characterized in that

the additional closure device (2, 3) is connected to a
radio transmitting unit (4) for radio connection with

the control centre and if the additional closure
device (2, 3) is closed, the perimeter security

detectors are set,
there is disposed at the additional closure device (2,
3) or at the radio transmitting unit (4), a feeler or

switch (6) which is designed in such a way that the
switch status can be changed only with the additional

closure device (2, 3) opened, and
if the switch status of the switch or feeler (6) is
changed and the additional closure device (2, 3) is

subsequently closed, all the detectors are set.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in that
there is disposed in the additional closure device (2, 3)

or the radio transmitting unit (4) a detector (5, 51) which
determines whether the terminal door is closed, and the

radio transmitting unit (4) transmits a setting signal only
if the terminal door and the additional closure device (2,

3) are closed.
Device according to Claim 2, characterized in that the
detector (5, 51) comprises a magnetic contact (5) that is

disposed in the radio transmitting unit (4) or in the
additional closure device (2, 3), and a magnet (51) that is

disposed on the frame of the terminal door. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 3,

characterized in that it contains a plurality of additional
closure devices (2, 3) that are disposed on windows and

doors of the surveillance area and the control centre (1)
is designed in such a way that, if a setting signal is

received from an additional closure device (2, 3), it
monitors the statuses of the remaining additional closure

devices and sets the alarm system only if all the
additional closure devices are closed.
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 4,

characterized in that the additional closure devices (2, 3)
contain visual or audible indicating units (7) that

indicate to the user whether the alarm system has been set
or can be set.
