<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of
concrete technology and to compositions useful in
producing cellular (foamed) concrete and to a
process for producing same. The invention also
relates to producing cellular concrete suitable for
use in producing lightweight aggregate material
therefrom, especially lightweight aggregate for use
in poured concrete and concrete block mixes and for
lightweight insulation mixes.Concrete, composed of cement, aggregate
and water, is a well known building material having
considerable compressive strength. There are
multiplicities of application where low density
concrete is a suitable, useful or desirable material
since it has the advantage of light weight and
favorable insulation properties.In general there have been several methods
to produce such low density concrete and lightweight
aggregate. In one way, lightweight aggregate
material, such as cinders available in ash heaps
from coal-burning power plants, was used to produce
such low density concrete products. However, a
decade ago or more, when such cinders were no longer
generally available, manufacturers substituted
bloated slate, clays and shale, fly ash, pumice and
the like which they produced in rotary kilns or
sintering machines. While such kilned or sintered
materials and methods using such heat-expanded
materials are still currently in use, they are not 
very satisfactory or efficient as well as being
increasingly very expensive due to material costs,
fuel costs and labor costs. The expensive massive
kilns or sintering equipment produce only relatively
small amounts of product per working shift.
Moreover, such heat-expanded aggregate making
methods have not produced products with uniformly
satisfactory properties. Besides requiring
expensive and cumbersome machinery, heat-expansion
processes create highly undesirable air pollution.
Additionally, the specialized raw materials for
producing such heat-expanded products are only
available in certain limited geographic areas, often
remote from the desired site for use.Another manufactured lightweight aggregate
is expanded slag. Hot dross is separated from the
molten iron in steel production and is put in
contact with water to cause bloating. Since the
residue is a by-product, the aggregate is
economical, but since it is dross it is neither
uniform nor stable and therefore does not produce
sufficiently uniform low density concrete.Additionally, it has been suggested that
low density concrete could be produced by making a
"cellular concrete" by adding air-bubble
