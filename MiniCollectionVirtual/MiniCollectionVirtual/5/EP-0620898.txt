Vane pump comprising a casing (3), a controlling 
collar (4) which is guided in a leakproof manner in the 

casing (3) and is movable, relative to a rotor (1) 
mounted in the casing (3) and surrounded by the 

controlling collar (4), transversely to the axial 
direction of the rotor (1), wherein an intake region (7, 

14) of the pump is defined by a volume, increasing in the 
direction of rotation of the rotor (1), of a cell (5) 

formed between two adjacent vanes (2), the rotor (1) and 
the controlling collar, and a discharge region (8, 11) is 

defined by a volume, decreasing in the direction of 
rotation, of the cell (5), and wherein at least one 

controlling component (22, 23) is provided for setting 
the position of the controlling collar (4) in dependence 

on the prevailing pumping parameters, characterised in 
that the controlling collar (4) is provided in the 

vicinity of the discharge region (8, 11) with at least 
one recess (20, 21) which is open towards the outside of 

the controlling collar (4) and serves for receiving a 
controlling component (22, 23). 
Vane pump according to claim 1, characterised in 
that two recesses (20, 21) are provided situated on 

opposite sides of the controlling collar (4). 
Vane pump according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that at least one recess (20, 21) has a cylindrical 

cross-section. 
Vane pump according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the controlling collar (4) is at 

the discharge side made double-walled and the discharge 
space (8) swept by the vanes (2) of the rotor (1)  

 
comprises radial openings (10) leading to a discharge 

chamber (11) formed by the double wall (6, 6'). 
Vane pump according to any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the recess is formed by a partly 

double-walled construction of the outer wall (6') of the 
controlling collar (4) on the discharge side. 
Vane pump according to any one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that a controlling piston (22) is 

provided in the recess (20). 
Vane pump according to claim 6, characterised in 
that the controlling piston (22) is guided in a leakproof 

manner and that an opening (26) interconnecting the 
discharge region (8, 11) and the recess (20) is provided, 

so that the controlling piston (22) is subjected to the 
pressure on the discharge side through the opening (26) 

from the inner side of the recess (20). 
Vane pump according to claim 6 or 7, characterised 
in that the piston (22) has a rounded end face (24) at 

the end projecting from the recess (20). 
Vane pump according to claim 2 or any claim appended 
to claim 2, characterised in that a compression spring 

(23) is received in the recess (21) which is situated 
opposite the first recess (20). 
Vane pump according to claim 9, characterised in 
that the compression spring (23) is at its end projecting 

from the recess (21) provided with a sliding cap (27). 
Vane pump according to any one of claims 1 to 10, 
characterised in that the inner wall of the casing (3) is  

 
lined with a wear-resistant material at least in the 

region exposed to the action of the controlling 
components (22, 23). 
Vane pump according to claim 11, characterised in 
that the wear-resistant material is a spring steel sheet. 
Vane pump according to any one of claims 1 to 12, 
characterised in that the controlling collar (4) is 

swingably mounted at its side remote from the recesses 
(20, 21).
