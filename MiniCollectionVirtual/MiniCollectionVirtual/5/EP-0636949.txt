<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a charging
member and charging device for charging a member to be
charged such as an image bearing member, and a process
cartridge detachably mountable to an image forming
apparatus.In a contact charging type, a charging member
supplied with a voltage is contacted to an image
bearing member (photosensitive drum) to directly
transfer electric charge to the photosensitive drum to
charge the surface thereof to d predetermined
potential. As compared with a widely used corona
discharger, the contact type is advantageous in that
the voltage required for providing a predetermined
potential on the photosensitive drum surface can be
reduced, that the amount of ozone produced through the
charging process is so small that the necessity for
a filter for removing ozone is eliminated, that the
structure of the exhausting system can be simplified
correspondingly so that no filter maintenance is required, and
the overall structure simplified.For this reason, it is particularly noted as
a means replaceable with corona discharger to charge 
an image bearing member such as a photosensitive
member or the dielectric member or another
photosensitive member.In the contact charging method or apparatus,
there is a type in which an oscillating voltage in the
form of a DC biased AC voltage is applied to the
contact charging member
for the
purpose of uniform charging operation.Figure 22 shows an example thereof, in which
reference numeral 1 designates a photosensitive drum,
which is rotated in a predetermined, namely in the
clockwise direction R1, at a predetermined peripheral
speed (process speed). It may be an
electrophotographic photosensitive member or
electrostatic recording dielectric material or the
like.Designated by a reference numeral 2 is a
conductive roller (charging roller) as the contact
charging member. The charging roller 2 comprises a
solid type rubber such as a urethane rubber, EPDM or
the like having an electroconductivity, as designated
by a reference numeral 2r. The hardness thereof is
60 - 70 degrees (Asker-C). The charging roller 2 is
press-contacted to the surface of the photosensitive
drum 1 at a predetermined pressure provided by springs
3 at the opposite end portions of the core metal 2a. 
It is rotated by rotation of the photosensitive drum 1
in a direction R2. The charging roller 2 is supplied
with a voltage 4, which supplies through a contact
leaf spring (not shown) contacted to the core metal 2a
of the charging roller 2, a voltage (Vac + Vdc) which
is a DC voltage Vdc
