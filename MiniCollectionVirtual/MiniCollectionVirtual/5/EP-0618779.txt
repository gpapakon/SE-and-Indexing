<ABSTRACT>
A dishwasher having spray arm, motor and pump components configured and mounted so as to occupy very low height. In one form the complete wash system is arranged as a drawer which slides in and out of a cabinet. The cabinet opening is stiffened against racking forces by incorporating an inverse portal frame in the opening flange. A synchronous AC motor is used with the rotor running within the wash chamber driving a wash pump integrated with a rotating spray arm.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to dishwashers, and in particular, but not solely,
domestic dishwashers.Conventional domestic front loading dishwashers provide two racks for
stacking dishes, one in the lower zone of the wash chamber and the other in
the upper zone. Such dishwashers are normally designed to fit under a typical
domestic kitchen bench top with a maximum height of 900mm. Generally the
lower rack is designed to take larger dishes, e.g. plates up to 280mm in
diameter, and because of the overall height limitation the upper rack can only
take lower height dishes. Such dishwashers lack flexibility in that they cannot
efficiently wash (in a single wash) dish loads made up of a mix of dish sizes
other than that dictated by the manufacturer. For example, a load of large
diameter plates exceeding the number that can be accommodated in the lower
rack must be cleaned using two completely separate wash cycles, even
although the top rack could be empty. Further, it is not feasible to load soiled
dishes unless all cleaned dishes are first removed. In addition it is not efficient
to wash less than full loads. Washing must be deferred until the dishwasher
has been completely filled.The first two problems identified above can be overcome to some extent
by the use of two dishwashers. However, cost and space factors usually
mean this is not a viable option. The present invention proposes a solution to
the above problems by providing a smaller dishwasher intended to be used as
one module in a two-module pair. The dishwasher is of very low height to
allow the option of "over and under" stacking of two modules below a kitchen
bench.Construction of a low height machine imposes severe design constraints.In most conventional dishwashers components such as the wash pump
and drain pump, along with associated electric motors, are mounted under
the wash chamber thereby consuming height which could be available to the
wash chamber. In US 3,587,939 (Nystuen et al) wash and drain pumps driven 
by a common induction motor are disclosed which are located inside the wash
chamber and the motor is operable submerged in the wash water. A
disadvantage of this system is the need to seal the motor stator from the wash
liquid. A drain pump which operates with a submerged motor rotor and a
stator external to the pump casing is disclosed in EP 287,984 (Askoll SPA).
However this pump requires the use of two separate chambers for the motor
rotor and pump impeller respectively and is not easy to service in use.
Further, it is not possible to use

accommodate dishes and within which wash liquid is

circulated, characterised in that

(a) a well (106) is provided in the floor (82) of
said chamber, which well forms part of said chamber,
(b) an electric motor for powering a wash liquid
pump includes:


(i) a rotor (100) mounted within said well,
said rotor having a drive shaft (99)

and
(ii) a co-acting stator (111) outside said
wash chamber engaged about the exterior

surface of said well such that the
cylindrical sides of said well lie in

the rotor-stator air gap, and
(c) said pump has an impeller (95 or 101)
directly mounted on said rotor drive shaft.
A dishwasher as claimed in Claim 1 wherein said
pump circulates wash liquid and further comprising


(a) a wash chamber drain pump (79) including:

(i) an impeller (101) located in said
well together with said motor rotor,

said impeller being driven by said
rotor,
(ii) a casing formed by the well walls
(106) proximate to said impeller,
(iii) a liquid inlet and a liquid outlet
(109) in said casing, and
(b) a liquid passageway (108) connecting said
wash chamber with said casing inlet, said rotor

when rotated in a first direction causing said 
pump to drain wash liquid from the wash chamber for delivery at said

liquid outlet.
A dishwasher according to claim 2 wherein said rotor (100) and said drain
pump impeller (101) are mounted on a common vertical axis with the drain pump

impeller mounted below and coupled to said rotor.
A dishwasher according to claim 2 wherein said drain pump impeller (101)
is integrally formed on an end face of said motor rotor (100).
A dishwasher according to claim 3 wherein said drain pump impeller (101)
comprises a plurality of symmetrically disposed radial blades (102) protruding from

the end face of said motor rotor (100).
A dishwasher according to claim 1 wherein said electric motor is a salient pole
synchronous alternating current motor having a permanent magnet rotor.
A dishwasher according to claim 6 wherein said stator (111) includes two pole
pairs (110a, 110b) mounted orthogonally in a flux return ring (125) such that the

pole faces lie on a circle coincident with the exterior surface of said well (106).
A dishwasher according to claim 7 wherein the windings (128) of each pole
pair are commutated by a motor drive circuit which provides pulses from the

alternating current mains to cause the rotor to start rotating in the desired direction
and come up to attain synchronous speed.
A dishwasher according to claim 8 wherein said motor drive circuit includes
speed determining means for determining when said rotor has almost reached

synchronous speed and a switching means triggered by said speed determining 
means which disconnects the windings of each pole pair from the drive circuit and

connects a single pole pair across the single phase mains supply.
A dishwasher according to claim 9 wherein said switching means connects the
windings of the second pole pair in series with a capacitor across the single phase

mains supply.
A dishwasher according to claim 8 wherein said drive circuit continues to
supply commutation pulses to said pole windings after synchronous speed is

attained.
A dishwasher according to claim 1 wherein said pump is adapted to drain said
wash chamber and comprises:


(i) an impeller (101) located in said well (106) together with said
motor rotor (100), said impeller being driven by said rotor,
(ii) a casing formed by the well walls (106) proximate to said
impeller,
(iii) a liquid inlet (108) and a liquid outlet (109) in said casing,
and

a liquid passageway (108) connecting said wash chamber with said casing
inlet, said rotor when rotated in a first direction causing said pump to drain

wash liquid from the wash chamber for delivery at said liquid outlet.
A dishwasher according to claim 12 further including:

a wash pump impeller (95) driven by said motor rotor (100), and a spray arm
(75) having liquid discharge nozzles (90) rotatably supported in the bottom of said

wash chamber for rotation about said wash pump impeller, said spray arm having 
internal surfaces (87) which define a co-acting casing for said wash pump impeller

and which define a volute which allows delivery of wash liquid pumped from said
casing to said nozzles.
A dishwasher according to claim 13 wherein said impeller is configured such
that effective pumping only occurs when the motor rotor (100) is rotated in a second

direction opposite to said first direction.
A dishwasher according to claim 13 wherein said spray arm internal surfaces
(87) are so configured in relation to said impeller that the reaction force applied

thereto by wash liquid accelerated by the impeller and passing into the spray arm
volute causes rotation of said spray arm (75) in the direction of rotation of the

impeller (95).
A dishwasher according to claim 13 wherein said wash pump impeller (95)
comprises a hub having a plurality of substantially radially disposed blades (96)

extending therefrom to primarily induce radial flow, said impeller rotates about a
vertical axis, and the lower edge (97) of each blade is curved out of the radial plane

forwardly in the working direction of rotation to induce a small axial flow.
A dishwasher according to claim 12 further including a second impeller (105)
coupled to and mounted above said rotor (100), said impeller (95) configured such

that when the rotor rotates in said first direction a hydrostatic head is generated in
said well (106) which equals the pressure generated by the drain pump impeller

(101) to thereby prevent leakage of wash liquid pumped by said drain pump
upwardly around the rotor (100). 
A dishwasher according to Claim 13, wherein said
spray arm (75) central undersurface is open to provide an

axial flow inlet for said wash pump, and further including
