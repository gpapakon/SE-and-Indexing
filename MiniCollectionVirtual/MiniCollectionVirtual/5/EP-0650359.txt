<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a transdermal therapeutic system containing 17-(beta)-oestradiol plus, optionally, other active substances, the system having a laminate structure built up on a back film which is substantially impermeable both to the active substances and to water, with one or more matrix films and, optionally, an adhesive film. The system is characterized in that at least one of the matrix films or the adhesive film contains anhydrous 17-(beta)-oestradiol in crystalline form.

Transdermal therapeutic system comprising the active
substance 17-β-estradiol and, optionally, further active

substances, with a laminated structure positioned
on a backing layer which is substantially impermeable

to active substances and moisture, one or several
matrix layers and, optionally, an adhesive layer,

characterized in that at least one of the matrix layers
or the adhesive layer contains anhydrous 17-β-estradiol

in crystalline form, and that said system, during storage
prior to application, is present in a gas-tight,

sealed packing material together with a dehydrating or
water-absorbing substance.
The transdermal therapeutic system according to claim
1, consisting of a matrix layer and a skin-facing,

pressure-sensitive adhesive layer, characterized in
that the matrix layer contains 17-β-estradiol in crystalline

and anhydrous form, whereas the adhesive layer
is free from crystalline 17-β-estradiol.
The transdermal therapeutic system according to claim 1
or 2, characterized in that the base material of the

adhesive layer is an acrylic-acid ester copolymer.
The transdermal therapeutic system according to claim 1
or 2, characterized in that the base material of at

least one of the matrix layers is polyisobutylene. 
The transdermal therapeutic system according to claim 1
or 2, characterized in that the base material of at

least one of the matrix layers is an acrylic-acid ester
copolymer.
The transdermal therapeutic system according to claim 3
or 5, characterized in that the acrylic-acid ester

copolymer has a solubility for the active substance
17-β-estradiol (anhydrous) of between 0.4 and 3.0%

(g/g).
Process for the production of a transdermal therapeutic
system according to one or more of the claims 1 to 6,

characterized in that initially a suspension of 17-β-estradiol

semihydrate in a solution, dispersion, or
melt of the matrix base material is prepared and

applied in the form of a layer on a foliar base substrate
material, that the layer is dried, and that subsequently

the substrate thus obtained is heated to 90
to 175°C, whereby the 17-β-estradiol semihydrate is

converted to anhydrous 17-β-estradiol in crystalline
form.
The process for the production of a transdermal therapeutic
system according to claims 1 to 6, characterized

in that initially a suspension of 17-β-estradiol semihydrate
in a solution, dispersion or melt of the base

material of the matrix or adhesive layer is prepared
and is applied in the form of a layer on a foliar, 

preferably dehesive, base substrate material, that said
layer is optionally dried, applied onto a backing layer

which is substantially impermeable to active substances
and moisture and separated by contour punching and foil

cutting and packed in a gas-tight, sealed packing
material, whereby water-absorbing substances are added

to the packing material, and that, due to the dehydration
effected by the water-absorbing substances over a

prolonged period of time, a pseudopolymorphic conversion
of 17-β-estradiol semihydrate to 17-β-estradiol in

crystalline and anhydrous form takes place.
The process for the production of a transdermal therapeutic
system according to claim 8, characterized in

that the conversion of 17-β-estradiol semihydrate to
17-β-estradiol in crystalline and anhydrous form is

carried out within a pre-storage period of, at the
most, one month.
