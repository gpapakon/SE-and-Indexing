<ABSTRACT>
A first tool part (10) is involved which has a patrix bearer (12) and a connected patrix (14), and a father membrane (20) and channels (16) for introduction of a fluid under pressure between the patrix and the father membrane. A second tool part (30) has at least two constructional parts which are axially movable in relation to the first tool parts (10) and to each other, including a matrix (40). The matrix is fitted with a another membrane (70), and is enclosed by a ring-shaped guide body (32). With the press tool closed, the matrix is movable between a press position in which it fully supports the mother membrane and an unloaded position, in which it allows the mother membrane to expand in a radial direction.

A compression moulding die for the isostatic moulding
of steep-wall hollow bodies (82) from ceramic material (80),

comprising

a first die part (10) which includes a male mould support
(12) with a male mould (14) fixed to the same, a paternal

membrane (20), and passages (16) for the introduction of
pressurized fluid between the male mould (14) and the paternal

membrane (20), and
a second die part (30) which includes at least two structural
components, among them a female mould (40), which are

movable axially with respect to the first die part (10) and
whith respect to each other,
characterized
 in that the female mould (40) is lined with
a maternal membrane (70), enclosed by an annular guide member

(32), and movable within the guide member, when the compression
mould is closed, between a compression position

at which the female mould (40) fully supports the maternal
membrane (70) across the entire surface area and a relief

position at which the female mould (40) permits the maternal
membrane (70) to expand in radial direction.
The compression moulding die as claimed in claim 1,
characterized in that the maternal membrane (70) is compressed

radially by the female mould (40) in the compression position
thereof and is relaxed in the relief position of the female

mould.
The compression moulding die as claimed in claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that the guide member (32) has an inner

wall (34) which flares conically in a direction away from
the die part (10), and the female mould (40) has a complementary

outer wall (42) and is subdivided into a plurality 
of sectors (48) which are movable radially away from one

another.
The compression moulding die as claimed in claim 3,
characterized in that the sectors (48) are biased radially

away from one another.
The compression moulding die as claimed in claim 3 or 4,
characterized in that the sectors (48) are guided on a female

mould support (50) for their radial movements, the female
mould support being movable together with the sectors in

axial direction with respect to the guide member (32).
The compression moulding die as claimed in claim 5,
characterized in that a spring assembly (58) is clamped between

the guide member (32) and the female mould support (50) and
attempts to move the female mould support (50) together with

the female mould (40) axially away from the male mould (14).
The compression moulding die as claimed in any one of
claims 3 to 6, characterized in that the maternal membrane

(70) is secured by its outer edge (72) to the sectors (48)
of the female mould (40).
The compression moulding die as claimed in claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that the maternal membrane (70) is clamped

by its outer edge (72) to the guide member (32), and the
female mould, as a whole, is movable axially away from the

maternal membrane (70).
The compression moulding die as claimed in claim 8,
characterized in that the female mould (40) is biased by

a spring assembly (84) with respect to the guide member (32)
in the sense of movement axially away, from the maternal

membrane (70) and is displaceable in opposite direction by
at least one adjusting member (86). 
The compression moulding die as claimed in claim 8 or 9,
characterized in that the female mould (40) and the maternal

membrane (70) have complementary inside and outside surfaces
(44, 74), respectively, which are less steep than the outside

surface of the compressed hollow body (82) and the
complementary inside surface (76) of the maternal membrane

(70).
