<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for cutting and breaking rock is described. The apparatus comprises a cutting disc (13) having an attached wedge (11). Cutting disc (13) can be rotated by shaft (16) to cut a groove into rock. After a pre-determined distance, wedge (11) is forced into the cut groove to cause the rock above the groove to be broken away. Shaft (16) is powered by a drive motor, and can include a kick back mechanism to prevent wedge (11) from being trapped in the cut groove. The entire apparatus can be mounted to the three point linkage of a tractor.

<DESCRIPTION>
 TITLE OF THE INVENTION APPARATUS FOR CUTTING AND EXCAVATING SOLIDS TECHNICAL FIELD THIS INVENTION relates to an apparatus for cutting and excavating solids and particularly to an apparatus which can cut and break rock, coal, stone and the like.BACKGROUND ARTExcavation of solids such as rock, coal, stone, ores, and the like is required in a variety of circumstances. These include in the mining industry for recovering ore, quarries, recovery of coal, sinking of bore holes, excavation of tunnels and the like for sewerage, conduit lines, vehicles, and cutting of trenches, channels and the like.It is known to excavate solids using basting techniques. However, blasting techniques are less suitable for excavation of tunnels, trenches or channels. Blasting also requires strict safety precautions. Another technique to excavate solids is by using cutting or grinding apparatus. Such apparatus are provided with one or more cutting discs which are provided with peripheral teeth (or picks). The discs are forced against the solid to be cut at extremely high forces and cause the solid to be cut away in small pieces.A disadvantage with this type of apparatus is that the cutting process is extremely energy intensive and extremely energy inefficient. The technique releases large amounts of heat and requires large equipment to provide the necessary power to rotate the cutting discs and to force the cutting discs against a rock face.Examples of such apparatus are found in theWohlmeyer US patents 2758825, 3297101 and 3379024. One disadvantage with excavating rock in a purely cutting process, is the enormous wear and tear placed on the cutting disc and its cutting teeth. Thus, 

a high degree of maintenance is required on the cutter discs.The apparatus is also of a large size to accommodate the equipment necessary to power and hold the cutter discs. Thus, the apparatus is expensive to use and maintain and is unsuitable for relatively small-scale excavations. These known apparatus are currently used in tunnelling.In order to improve the effectiveness of solid removal, it has been known to use a principle called "cut and break". In this process, an apparatus initially cuts a groove in the solid with a cutting disc and then inserts a wedge into the cut groove in a separate action. The wedge causes the rock or other solid to break away from the groove. Thus, excavation of the solid is due to a cutting action and a separate breaking action.A known apparatus using this cut and break technique is known as a "McKinlay Entry Driver"

CLAIMS :
1. An apparatus for cutting and breaking a solid, the apparatus having a cutting disc with a peripheral edge, a top wall and a bottom wall, and a wedge located on at least one of said walls and extending therefrom and spaced inwardly relative to the peripheral edge of the cutting disc.
2. The apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the peripheral edge is provided with a plurality of cutting picks.
3. The apparatus as claimed in claim 2, wherein a first wedge extends from a top wall, and a second wedge extends from a bottom wall of the cutting disc.
4. The apparatus as claimed in claim 3, wherein the first and second wedges are connected together.
5. The apparatus as claimed in claim 4, wherein the first and second wedges are releasably mounted relative to each other, and to the cutting disc.
6. The apparatus as claimed in claim 5, wherein at least one said wedge has an inclined leading face.
7. The apparatus as claimed in claim 6, wherein the inclined angle is between 1 to 10 degrees.
8. The apparatus as claimed in claim 1, comprising a rotatable shaft member connected to the cutting disc, the shaft member being rotatably driven by a drive means.
9. The apparatus as claimed in claim 8, including a biassing means to bias the rotatable shaft member, and therefore the cutting disc against the solid to be cut.
10. The apparatus as claimed in claim 9, wherein the biassing means provides sufficient force to the cutting disc to allow it to cut into the solid, but allows the shaft member to kick back should the wedge become jammed or stuck within the solid.
11. The apparatus as claimed in claim 10, wherein the drive means and biassing means is supported by frame assembly which is attachable to a vehicle.
12. The apparatus as claimed in claim 11, including 


ground engagable stabilisers to restrict sideways movement of the vehicle upon use of the apparatus.
