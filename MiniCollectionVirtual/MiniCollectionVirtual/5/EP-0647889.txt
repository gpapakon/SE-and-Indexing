<ABSTRACT>
An electrophotographic recording apparatus 
comprises a photosensitive drum (11), a transfer 

roller (13), a high voltage power supply circuit (48) 
for applying a transfer voltage to the transfer roller 

(13) and a CPU (21) for controlling the entire 
apparatus. The high voltage power supply circuit 

(48) supplies an output voltage (Vo) corresponding to 
a control signal issued from the CPU (21) as the 

transfer voltage to the transfer roller (13). At 
this time, the high voltage power supply circuit (48) 

sends a current detection signal to the CPU (21) to 
inform the same of an output current (I) which flows 

to the transfer roller (13). On the other hand, the 
CPU (21) outputs a control signal to the high voltage 

power supply circuit (48), the control signal 
corresponding to said current detection signal output 

from the high voltage power supply circuit (48). As 
a result, even if the output current (I) is varied 

depending on the kind of the print medium (15) and the 
resistance of the transfer roller (13), it is possible 

to generate the output voltage (Vo) in accordance with 
the varied output current (I).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrophotographic recording
apparatus such as an electrophotographic printer or an electronic copier.An electrophotographic recording apparatus has a photosensitive
drum. The surface of the photosensitive drum is first subjected to an
electrostatic charge, then light is selectively given to the surface of the
photosensitive drum by an exposure machine, thereby forming an
electrostatic latent image thereon. The electrostatic latent image is
developed when a developing machine supplies toner onto the surface of
the photosensitive drum. When a medium such as paper, etc. is passed
between the photosensitive drum and the developing machine, toner is
attracted toward the medium from the photosensitive drum to be
transferred onto the medium, thereby performing printing.Fig. 2 is a view for explaining a transfer process. In the same
figure, an electrostatic latent image formed on a photosensitive drum 11 is
developed by a developing machine 12. A developed toner image is
transferred onto a printing medium 15 by a transfer roller 13, which is
subjected to an electrostatic charge by a transfer power source 14, so that
the toner image is formed on the printing medium 15. A toner 16 on the
printing medium 15 is thereafter fixed to the printing medium 15 by a
fixing machine, not shown.Inasmuch as transfer efficiency of the toner 16 from the
photosensitive drum 11 onto the printing medium 15 is varied according to 
conditions at the time of transfer such as size of the medium, thickness of
the medium, atmospheric humidity, and atmospheric temperature, it is
necessary to change a voltage value to be applied from the transfer power
source 14 to the transfer roller 13 (hereinafter referred to as transfer
voltage) in accordance with these conditions.For example, an envelope needs higher transfer voltage than
a cut sheet of A4-size since the former is narrower and thicker than the
latter.EP-A-0520819 describes an electrophotographic printer
which includes an arrangement for measuring the resistance of a transfer
roller in a two stage process. The first stage provides an approximate
value of the resistance of the transfer roller while the printer is warming up
and the second stage generates an accurate value, given the approximate
value generated in the first stage, immediately prior to printing. The
second stage of resistance measurement may also account for the
resistance of the transfer medium in addition to the resistance of the
transfer roller.EP-A-0404079 describes an
