<ABSTRACT>
Method and apparatus for cleaning elongated objects of 
surface contaminants. The elongated objects (11) are 

exposed to a liquid or solid inert gas LN2 at suitable 
quantities to embrittle the contaminants. The 

elongated objects are then drawn through a die orifice (16) 
causing the embrittled surface contaminants to be 

removed from the elongated objects.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention deals with a method and device 
for cleaning elongated objects of surface contaminants. 
This invention eliminates the need to provide pickling 
solutions of various acids and/or solvents and/or 
ultrasound cleaning systems thus providing for the 
cleaning of elongated objects in a more environmentally 
favored system than heretofore thought possible. Elongated objects such as wires, rods and tubular or 
flat shapes (such as tubing, strip, plates, etc.) are 
oftentimes contaminated with undesirable surface 
coatings. In the case of steel wires, manufacturing 
often results in the formation on their surface of 
oxides, including rust or impurities such as dirt 
particles, lubricant and compound residues, etcetera. In the case of copper wires, exposure to the 
environment results in copper oxidation in the form of 
a surface scale which consists of a mixture of cuprous 
(red) and cupric (black) oxides. Such oxidation layer 
needs to be removed from the copper surface because it 
greatly reduces the strength of the copper wire and its 
ability to withstand further processing.  There have been a number of techniques suggested by 
the prior art to remove surface contamination. For 
example, U.S. Patent 1,993,400 teaches various methods 
for annealing and oxidizing a wire to remove known and 
unknown soap or grease compounds used in drawing the 
wire to size, by passing electric current through the 
wire to heat it. The book entitled "Ferrous Wire", 
vol. 1, chapter 6 - Chemical Cleaning and Coating, 
published by the Wire Association International Inc., 
discloses various methods to clean ferrous wires, such 
as pickling, ultrasonic cleaning, etcetera. Batch 
pickling still remains the most commonly used cleaning 
method in the wire industry to remove surface 
contaminants. In this method, baths of either sulfuric 
or hydrochloric acid are placed in line in such a 
manner that the material may be dipped in acid tanks, 
rinse tanks, lime, borax and finally baked before 
passing the metal onto the wire mill itself. Although it has been suggested, e.g., in U.S. Patent 
4,401,479, that ultrasonic cleaning can be employed to 
remove surface contaminants, apart from specialized 
one-wire systems, ultrasonic cleaning in standard tanks 
is seldom used for wire, since the energy concentration 
is usually too low for one-pass continuous-line 
systems. Flash pickling is also disclosed in this book. 
However, flash pickling unfortunately produces fumes  
 
and strong acid carryover. As a result,

<CLAIMS>
A method of cleaning the surface of an elongated object in 
order to remove contaminants therefrom, said method comprising 

exposing said elongated object to a gaseous, liquid and/or solid inert gas 
in suitable quantities to substantially embrittle said contaminants 

whereupon said elongated object is drawn through an orifice causing the 
embrittled surface contaminants to be removed from said elongated 

object. 
The method of Claim 1, wherein said inert gas comprises a 
member selected from the group consisting of liquid nitrogen, liquid argon 

and solid carbon dioxide. 
The method of Claim 1, wherein said elongated object is 
subjected to annealing after said contaminants have been removed 

therefrom. 
The method of Claim 3, wherein said annealing is carried out 
in an inert atmosphere. 
The method of Claim 4, wherein said inert atmosphere is 
established by using the inert gas recycled after exposure to said 

elongated object for embrittling said surface contaminants. 
The method of Claim 1, wherein said orifice is a die orifice 
having substantially the same section as the elongated object section.
