<ABSTRACT>
1. Igniter for a pyrotechnic device with a housing (1) in which a striker (9) tensioned by a spring (11) is held by a releasable locking device at a certain distance from a bearing (24) for a detonating device such as a percussion cap, piezoelectric device or similar. An actuating mechanism (2), which is coaxial with the striker (9), accessible from the outside of the housing (1) and mounted on a bearing such that it can be slid and/or rotated in the housing (1) to fire the igniter by tensile force and/or pressure and/or torsional force, acts on the locking device.  The features of the igniter are that the striker (1) and the actuating mechanism (2) are executed as telescopically interacting components of which the outer has at last one opening (12) and the inner at least one recess (17), and that the locking device has at least one stop (13), which is mounted in the opening (12) and which engages the recess (17), and an enclosed projection (18) on which the stop (13) which engages the recess (17) is supported.
