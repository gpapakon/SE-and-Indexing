Single contact spring, especially for RF-screening 
of electronic devices, for latch-locking into sheet-metal 

apertures, characterized in that it comprises a 
latch cage (1) and a resilient contact part (2) 

configured as a contact cup (6), in that the latch cage 
(1) is configured in a trough shape and, in its lower 

part, trapezoidally in cross-section, is open at its two 
front ends and is provided on its two longitudinal sides 

with two cutouts (16) located one opposite the other, in 
that the top edges (3) of the longitudinal sides are 

angled-off outward, in that the contact cup (6) is held 
by means of an angled-off carrier part (14) fastened to 

one of the front ends and in that in one of the cutouts 
(16) in the longitudinal sides there is disposed an 

outwardly bent-off elbow (8) in which there engages a 
correspondingly opposite-bent, hook-shaped part (15), 

which is connected to the contact part (6). 
Single contact spring according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the contact cup (6) is conically 

configured. 
Single contact spring according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the contact cup (6) is pyramidally 

configured.

latch cage (1) and a roof-shaped contact cup (6) having 

at least two roof slopes, in that the latch cage (1) is 
configured in a trough shape and, in its lower part, 

trapezoidally in cross-section, is open at its two front 
ends and is provided on its two longitudinal sides with 

two cutouts (16) located one opposite the other, in that 
the top edges (3) of the longitudinal sides are angled-off 

outward, and in that one of the roof slopes continues 
into a convexly curved, resilient carrier part (14), 

which is led through below the base (18) of the latch 
cage (1) and which is connected to that front end of the 

latch cage (1) lying opposite this roof slope, whilst 
running under the base (18) of the said latch cage.
