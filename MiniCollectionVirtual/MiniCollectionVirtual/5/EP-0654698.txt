<ABSTRACT>
A camera includes a taking lens and a 
variable aperture diaphragm adjustable to provide a 

relatively large aperture for effecting a relatively 
shallow depth of field of the taking lens and a smaller 

aperture for effecting a less shallow depth of field of 
the taking lens. Also included are manually operated 

means for selecting a portrait mode when taking a 
picture of a person and means for adjusting the 

diaphragm to provide the smaller aperture when the 
portrait mode is selected, whereby the less shallow 

depth of field of the taking lens is used to take a 
picture of a person in the portrait mode.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to
the field of photography, and, more particularly, to a
camera having a portrait mode.Present day cameras offer camera users a
variety of modes in which to record images. Examples
of these modes are fill flash mode, self-timer mode,
portrait mode and double-exposure mode.The Olympus IS-3 DLX Camera has a portrait
mode used to record the image of one or more persons.
In the portrait mode, the widest aperture is used to
obtain a shallow depth of field. Additionally, an
auto-zooming function is actuated when the camera is
set to the portrait mode. The auto-zooming function
utilizes information, including the camera subject
distance obtained from a range-finder, to move a zoom
lens to a position deemed desirable for taking a
portrait picture. Further, there is no indication that
the camera's flash is automatically fired during
portrait mode picture taking. EP-A-219 658 discloses a camera which has a means for selecting different modes. When a
certain mode is selected, for example the "trimming mode3" (which can be used to take a
portrait), a smaller aperture is provided. By utilizing the widest aperture when set to
the portrait mode, the Olympus IS-3 DLX Camera obtains
a relatively shallow depth of field. Having a shallow
depth of field requires extremely precise focusing to
insure that the subject to be photographed is in focus,
especially at the short focus distances typically used
in portrait photography. If the camera is not
precisely focused on the subject, the subject will be
out of focus in the recorded image, thereby degrading
image quality.In addition, there is no indication that the
Olympus IS-3 DLX Camera's flash is automatically fired
during portrait mode picture taking. It may be
desirable to fire the flash, even in bright, sunlit 
conditions, in order to avoid harsh facial shadows on
the subject to be photographed. A camera operator can
forget to select flash picture taking when in the
portrait mode, resulting in harsh facial shadows which
degrade image quality.Further, the Olympus IS-3 DLX Camera utilizes
an auto-zooming function when in the portrait mode.
However, having an auto-zooming function in a camera
increases the complexity and cost of the camera.In accordance with the present invention a camera is provided as
defined in claim 1.By adjusting the diaphragm to a smaller
aperture when in the portrait mode, a less shallow
depth of field is obtained than would be available at 
the larger aperture. Having a less shallow depth of
field increases the

<CLAIMS>
A camera (11) comprising an objective lens (10), a variable aperture diaphragm (16) adjustable
to provide a relatively large aperture for effecting a relatively shallow depth of

field of said lens and a smaller aperture for effecting a less shallow depth of field of said
lens, and manually operated means (19) for selecting a portrait mode, wherein the

camera (10) also comprises means constructed such that said diaphragm is set to provide
said smaller aperture when said portrait mode is selected, wherein said camera further

comprises means for emitting light (13) to illuminate the object to be photographed,
said light emitting means being operated to emit light every time a picture is taken in said

portrait mode, and wherein said lens includes a zoom lens system (12, 14) moveable
between a relatively short focal length and one or more longer focal lengths, said zoom

lens system being moved to one and the same longer focal length every time a picture is
taken in said portrait mode.
The camera (11) of claim 1, further characterized by :


said objective lens (10) being moveable between a plurality of focus distances including a
shortest focus distance, utilized only when a picture of a person is taken in the portrait

mode, and one or more longer focus distances.
The camera (11) of claim 1, wherein said diaphragm includes a shutter (16).
