<ABSTRACT>
There is provided an electronic package assembly having a die attach paddle (20) bonded to the package base (10') by a compliant adhesive (26). A recessed channel (34) formed in the base (10') is partially overlapped by the die attach paddle (20). During package sealing, excess adhesive (26) accumulates in the recessed channel (34), eliminating bridging of the adhesive (26) to the leadframe (16).

<DESCRIPTION>
 ELECTRONIC PACKAGE HAVING CONTROLLED EPOXY FLOWThis invention relates generally to an electronic package having controlled epoxy flow. More particularly, a recessed channel between the die attach paddle and leadframe prevents epoxy from bridging to the leadframe.Adhesively sealed metal packages are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,105,861 to Hascoe; 4,461,924 to Butt and 4,939,316 to Mahulikar et al. The packages have a metallic base and cover. A leadframe is disposed between the base and cover and adhesively bonded to both. The leadframe may have a centrally positioned die attach paddle with an electronic device, such as a silicon based semiconductor integrated circuit, bonded thereto. Small bond wires electrically interconnect the device to inner lead tips of the leadframe.Assembly of a metal package is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,897,508 to Mahulikar et al. One method includes:1. Providing a leadframe having a plurality of leads with inner and outer lead ends. The inner lead ends define a centrally positioned aperture. Spaced within this aperture is a die attach paddle. An integrated circuit device is bonded to the paddle by a low temperature solder, conductive adhesive or conductive glass.2. The semiconductor device is then electrically interconnected to the leadframe by small diameter, about .025 millimeter, gold, aluminum or copper bond wires 

extending from input/output pads on the face of the device to the inner lead tips.3. The leadframe assembly comprising the leadframe, die attach paddle and electrically interconnected device is then adhesively bonded to the metal base.4. A cover is bonded to the opposite side the leadframe encapsulating the inner leads and device.Care must be taken during assembly operations to insure that the adhesive bonding the die attach paddle to the base has minimal flow. To maximize the size of a semiconductor device which may be packaged in a package, the spacing between the die attach paddle and the inner lead tips is small, on the order of about 0.5-3mm. Excessive adhesive flow bridges the spacing contacting the inner lead tips. If wire bonding is completed prior to bonding of the paddle, bridging can break the thin bond wires. If wire bonding is delayed until after paddle attach, the bridged adhesive will interfere with wire bonding. In either case, the excessive flow of adhesive leads to a defective package.Attempts to control the adhesive flow have concentrated on process variables to minimize flow such as controlling cure time, temperature and pressure.
