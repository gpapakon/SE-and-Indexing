<ABSTRACT>
A dust filter having several filtering bags has a casing that envelops the filtering bags, at least one door in the casing and a hood (18) placed on the casing that covers with a lateral gap the upper edge (46) of the casing. This dust filter is characterized in that the part (14, 15, 16) of the casing designed as a door is covered in its closed position by the hood (18), with a lateral gap. From its lower position, in which the hood (18) covers with a lateral gap the upper edge (46) of said part (14, 15, 16) of the casing, it is possible to move only partial areas of the hood (18) into an upper position, in which the hood is positioned in such a way above the edge (46) of the casing that the part (14, 15, 16) of the casing designed as a door can be moved into its open position.

above and which surrounds the upper casing edge (46) from 

above with a lateral clearance,
 
characterized in that 
the casing part (14, 15, 16) designed as a door, in its 
SHUT position, is surrounded by the cover (18) from above 

with a lateral clearance, 
the cover (18) can be displaced only with part regions 
out of its lower position, in which it surrounds the 

upper casing edge (46) of this casing part (14, 15, 16) 
from above with a lateral clearance, into an upper 

position, in which it is positioned above this casing 
edge (46) in such a way that this casing part (14, 15, 

16) designed as a door can be moved into its OPEN 
position. 
Dust filter according to Claim 1,
 
characterized in that 


the casing part (14, 15, 16) designed as a door extends 
over the entire height of the casing (12). 
Dust filter according to Claim 1 or 2,
 
characterized in that 


the casing (12) is composed of a plurality of casing 
parts (14, 15, 16) of this type, in particular solely of 

casing parts (14, 15, 16) of this type. 
Dust filter according to one of the preceding 
claims,
 
characterized in that 


the casing (12) consists of a plurality of casing parts 
(14, 15, 16) overlapping one another in each case in the 

hinge region in an imbricated manner and designed as a 
door. 
Dust filter according to one of the preceding 
claims,
  
 

characterized in that 

the casing part (14, 15, 16) designed as a door, in its 
hinge region, is pivotably mounted in each case in a 

bottom ring (40) and in a top ring (38), 
this casing part (14, 15, 16) is releasably fastened, 
with its region located opposite the hinge region, to a 

casing part adjacent to it.

claims,
 
characterized in that 


tubular pieces (36) directed towards one another are 
fastened in each case to the bottom ring (40) and top 

ring (38), 
the casing part (14, 15, 16) possesses a bent-round 
edge portion (32), into which these two tubular pieces 

(36) can be pushed in each case from its ends. 
Dust filter according to Claim 6,
 
characterized in that 


the bent-round edge portion (32) surrounds a sleeve 
(34), into which the two tubular pieces (36) can be 

pushed. 
Dust filter according to one of the preceding 
claims,
 
characterized in that 


at least one holding part (64, 66, 68) is fastened to 
the lower peripheral edge region (44) of the cover (18), 
in the OPEN position of the cover, this holding part 
can be laid against a fixed counterpart (50) in such a 

way that this holding part and therefore the cover are 
held in their OPEN position by this counterpart. 
Dust filter according to Claim 8,
 
characterized in that
 
   the counterpart (50) is fastened to the top ring (38) 

so as to project upwards, 

the counterpart (50) possesses a shoulder design (56, 
60), on which the holding part (68) can be supported. 
Dust filter according to Claim 9,
 
characterized in that 


the shoulder design is formed by an approximately  
 

horizontal slot (60) in the counterpart. 
Dust filter according to one of the preceding 
claims,
 
characterized in that 


the holding part (68) has a guide (70, 72), such that 
only an upward and downward adjustment of the cover (18), 

but no lateral adjustment in the circumferential direction 
of the cover (18), is possible.
