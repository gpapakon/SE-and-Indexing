<ABSTRACT>
An infrared vehicle identification system [109] comprising 

a microprocessor controlled infrared (IR) transmnitter 
[112]
 located on an aircraft nose wheel landing strut 
[111]
 and an infrared receiver [128] including a 

microprocessor [44] enclosed in a plurality of edge light 

assemblies [20] located along surface pathways of an 

airport including runways and taxiways. The infrared 
transmitter [112]
 comprises an array of light emitting 
diodes [120]
 (LEDs) arranged in a semicircle within the 
horizontal plane. The transmitter [112]
 emits a plurality 
of fields [121, Fig.13]
 of encoded data to provide vehicle 
identification and position information. One field [122]
 
comprises a steady stream of pulses that allows the IR 

receiver [128] to calculate the baud rate of the 

transmitter [112] and automatically adjust its internal 

timing. The other fields include a unique word [123] for 

marking the beginning of a message, the number [124] of 

characters in the message, the' vehicle identification 
number [125]
, the vehicle position [126] and a checksum 

[127]. The latter [127]
 ensures that a complete and 
correct message has been received. If the transmitted 

message is interrupted for any reason, the checksum [127] 

will detect it and the messages will be voided. The IR 
receiver [128]
 relays a valid message of vehicle 
identification [125]
 and position [126] to a central 

computer system [12, Fig.1] at the airport control tower 

via the edge light assembly power wiring [21, Fig.1].

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to identification of airport 
surface traffic and in particular to an apparatus and method 
for detecting and identifying aircraft or other vehicle 
movement on airport taxiways, runways and other surface 
areas. Currently, ground control of aircraft at an airport is 
done visually by the air traffic controller in the tower. 
Low visibility conditions sometimes make it impossible for 
the controller to see all parts of the field. Ground 
surface radar can help in providing coverage during low 
visibility conditions; it plays an important part in the 
solution of the runway incursion problem but cannot solve 
the entire problem. A runway incursion is defined as "any 
occurrence at an airport involving an aircraft, vehicle, 
person, or object on the ground that creates a collision 
hazard or results in loss of separation with an aircraft 
taking off, intending to take off, landing, or intending to 
land." The U.S. Federal Administration Agency (FAA) has 
estimated that it can only justify the cost of ground 
surface radar at 29 of the top 100 airports in the United 
States. However, such radar only provides location 
information; it cannot alert the controller to possible 
conflicts between aircraft.  In the prior art, an airport control and monitoring 
system has been used to sense when an airplane reaches a 
certain point on a taxiway and controls switching lights on 
and off to indicate to the pilot when he may proceed on to a 
runway. Such a system sends microwave sensor information to 
a computer in the control tower. The computer comprises 
software for controlling the airport lighting and for 
providing fault information on the airport lighting via 
displays or a control panel to an operator. Such a system 
is described in sales information provided on a Bi-directional 
Series 7 Transceiver (BRITEE) produced by ADB-ALNACO, 
Inc., A Siemens Company, of Columbus, Ohio. 
However, such a system does not show the location of all 
vehicles on an airfield and is not able to detect and avoid 
a possible vehicle incursion. A well known approach to airport surface traffic 
control has been the use of scanning radars operating at 
high frequencies such as K-band in order to obtain adequate 
definition and resolution. An existing airport ground 
traffic control equipment of that type is known in the art 
as Airport Surface Detection Equipment (ASDE). However, 
such equipment provides surveillance only, no discrete 
identification of aircraft on the surface being available. 
Also there is
