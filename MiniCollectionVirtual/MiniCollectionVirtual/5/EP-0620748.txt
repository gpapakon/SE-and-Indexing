<ABSTRACT>
An automatic injector (1; 51; 81; 111; 142; 190; 200) having a needle (13) which is driven out of a body (1') of the injector automatically by drive means (5, 6) also has an associated protective, or sharps, assembly (3, 4; 53, 60; 83, 86, 112, 113, 143, 145; 181, 182; 192, 193; 206, 215). The sharps assembly has a cover member (3; 53; 83; 113; 143; 181; 193; 206) adapted to cover the needle after the injector has been used. The assembly is operative to provide relative movement between the injection needle and the cover member after injection so that the cover member covers the needle after use. The cover member is preferably actuated automatically so that the user never sees the needle.

<DESCRIPTION>
 AUTOMATIC INJECTORSThis invention relates to automatic injectors of the kind comprising a body which contains a charge of medicament, a needle held in a sheathed position within the body, releasable drive means which when released drives the needle from its sheathed position to an unsheathed, projecting, position projecting from the body, and expulsion means for discharging the medicament through the needle. Automatic injectors of this kind will hereinafter be referred to as of the kind set forth.Automatic injectors of the kind set forth have been developed primarily for use by persons who have to administer an injection into their own body at an instance which is not known beforehand. However, they may also be used by people who know that they will have to inject themselves, but are not skilled in the use of manually operated hypodermic syringes.There are very many proposals for automatic injectors.The aim of the present invention is to provide a new automatic injector which may be safer for use.According to the invention we provide an automatic injector of the kind set forth characterised in that it has an associated protective, or sharps, assembly comprising a cover member and means to provide relative movement between the cover member and the needle of the injector, the arrangement being such that after the needle has been moved to its projecting position the sharps assembly is operable to provide relative 

 movement between the projecting needle and the cover member such that the cover member covers the needle.Preferably the needle reduces the chance of the user accidentally pricking themselves or others. However, the cover member may simply prevent the user from seeing the needle.Despite the existence of many different kinds of automatic injectors hitherto they may have been a menace after use. Furthermore, after use the user can see the needle projecting from the body of the injector.Preferably the cover member reaches the needle, and most preferably the cover member defines a cover space. The cover member is preferably movable relative to the body. Alternatively or additionally the needle may move relative to the body to effect relative movement between the needle and the cover member.The cover member is preferably resiliently biased from a retracted, inoperative, position in which the needle can extend beyond it towards an extended, operative, position in which the needle does not extend beyond it.The cover member is preferably rigid and may have a hole through which the needle extends during

1. An automatic injector
(1;51;81;111;141; 160; 180;190;200;220) comprising: a body (1' ) ; a charge of medicament contained in said body; a needle (13; 162) held in a sheathed position within said body; releasable drive means (5,6) for driving said needle from said sheathed position to an unsheathed, projecting position in which said needle projects from said body, said releasable drive means further forcing said medicament through said needle; a protective assembly comprising a cover member (3;53;83;113;143;165;181;193;206;225) and relative movement means for enabling relative movement between said cover member and said body, said cover member having a protective position in which said cover member covers said needle; and biasing means
(4;60;86;112;145;166;182;192;215) for automatically urging said cover member away from said body and into said protective position after an injection operation.
2. The injector as claimed in Claim 1 further comprising restraining means (23;26;84;85) for restraining said cover member from being moved into said protective position.
3. The injector as claimed in Claim 2 further comprising activating means (25; 32) for releasing both said releasable drive means and said restraining means.
4. The injector as claimed in Claim 2 or Claim 3 wherein said releasable drive means and said restraining means are released simultaneously. 


 5. An injector as claimed in any one of Claims 2 to 4 wherein said cover member is engagable with an injectable surface, said biasing means urging said cover member against said injectable surface after said injectable surface is engaged and said restraining means is released.
6. The injector as claimed in any preceding claim wherein said releasable drive means comprises manually releasable detent means (7; 8) for actuating said automatic injector when said detent means is released.
7. The injector as claimed in Claim 6 further comprising means (9) for securing said detent means in an unreleasable condition and rendering said automatic injector inoperable.
8. The injector as claimed in any preceding claim wherein said biasing means is in a fully compressed state prior to an injection operation.
9. An injector as claimed in any preceding claim wherein said releasable drive means comprises a spring.
10. An injector as claimed in any preceding claim wherein said cover member has a retracted, inoperative, position in which said needle can extend beyond said cover member, and an operative, extended, position, comprising said protective position, in which said needle cannot extend beyond said cover member.
11. An injector as claimed in any preceding claim further comprising locking means (152,155,162,167,170,226) for locking said cover member in said protective position so as to restrain 


 said cover member against movement which would expose said needle.
12. An automatic injector
(1;51;81; 111; 141;161; 180; 190;200;220) comprising: a body (1' ) ; a charge of medicament contained in said body; a needle (13;162) held in a sheathed position within said body; releasable drive means (5,6) for driving said needle from said sheathed position to an unsheathed, projecting position in which which said needle projects from said body, said releasable drive means further forcing said medicament through said needle; a protective assembly comprising a cover member (3;53;83;113;143;165;181;193;206;220) and relative movement means for enabling relative movement between said cover member and said body, said cover member being engageable with an injectable surface and having a protective position in which said cover member covers said needle in said projecting position; biasing means (4;60;86;112;145;166; 182;192;215) for urging said cover member against said injectable surface after said injectable surface is engaged by said cover and injected by said needle, said biasing means automatically moving said cover member to said protective position as said needle is withdrawn from said injectable surface.
