<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus and technique for 
drawing a fluid specimen sample for analysis from a sample 
tube into a slide assembly and relates to a sample collection 
tube for use in such analysis. More specifically, this 
invention relates to an apparatus and technique for use in a 
urinalysis and to a slide assembly as used in such apparatus, 
into which a fluid sample can be conveniently drawn, and 
after analysis, flushed out. Systems and devices for urinalysis are extensively used 
and practices in clinics, laboratories and the like. With the 
increased presence of infectious diseases, such as AIDS, in 
biological materials, the need for safe systems and devices 
to minimize the handling of these potentially dangerous 
substances becomes evident. Urine sediment examination 
typically involves, as described in the U.S. Patents 
4,393,466 and 4,612,614, pouring of a sample into a tube 
which is then spun in a centrifuge to separate the sediment 
from its suspending fluid. After centrifugation, the cleared 
suspending fluid is poured out and the sediment resuspended 
in the remaining fluid. A sample of the  
 
resuspended sample must then be transferred to a 
microscopic slide for examination with a microscope. 
The '466 patent further describes a technique with 
which manual urine handling steps are eliminated and a 
video system is used to provide an electronic image of 
the urine specimen. A slide assembly is described 
which is shaped to provide a stable sample area where 
solid particles in the urine sample can be viewed. Various other types of urine or other fluid sample 
supply devices are shown and described in the art, see 
for example, U.S. Patents 4,302,421, 4,312,591, 
4,367,043, 4,448,752, 4,836,038, 3,948,607, 4,209, 256, 
and 4,271,123. U.S. Patent 4,804,267 to Walter Greenfield describes 
a urine sample analyzing system. A peristaltic 
pump is used to alternately pull a urine sample or a 
flushing fluid through a slide assembly, also known as 
a flow cell. A video display system is employed to 
investigate solids in the sample. Problems encountered with conventional slide 
assemblies may involve too great a thickness of the 
test specimen so that the microscope, which usually has 
a very short focal length, tends to be focused at 
different focal planes of the test specimen. When the 
flow cell is made with plastic components through which 
either the microscope views the test sample or through 
which illuminating light passes, distortions tend to 
appear in the field of
