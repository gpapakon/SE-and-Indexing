<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a chain-link suspension for the running gear of rail vehicles having high balance quality which is suitable for high travel speeds and high axial travel masses. The spring bolts (3) and/or chain links (1) have different diameters in their support areas. As far as possible the dimensions of the UIC replacement parts are adopted for the upper support area of the chain link (1), the upper chain-link block (4) and the upper spring bolt (3). The diameter of the lower support area including chain-link block (5) and/or the diameter of the lower spring bolt (3) are increased to such an extent that the transverse and longitudinal damping values required for high travel speed and large axial travel masses are achieved. The support area of the chain-link block (4, 5) is provided with a depression or the support area of the spring bolt (3) is provided with a flattened portion, the said depression or flattened portion contributing to increasing the longitudinal damping. In order to increase the transverse spring constant of the wheel set guidance, the chain links (1) can be arranged spread out apart from one another in the transverse direction of the wagon. The chain-link suspension according to the invention is provided for the running gear of rail vehicles and is particularly suitable for retrofitting in UIC standard wagons.

<CLAIMS>
Link hanger for running gear of rail vehicles, 
consisting of links (1), the top and bottom link blocks 

(4 and 5), which cooperate with a top and a bottom 
supporting area (2) respectively of the links, a spring 

eye (14) and spring-bracket bearing (15), the top and 
bottom spring bolts (3), which are arranged respectively 

in the top link block and spring eye and in the bottom 
link block with spring-bearing bracket, and a spring-bolt 

locking means, characterized in that the links (1), in 
their top and bottom supporting area, and/or the spring 

bolts (3) of the link hanger have different diameters, 
the top supporting area (2) of the link (1), the top link 

block (4) and the top spring bolt (3) being designed as 
far as possible to the dimensions of the UIC replacement 

parts, and the diameter of the bottom supporting area (2) 
of the link (1) including the link block (5) and/or the 

diameter of the bottom spring bolt (3) being designed to 
be larger than the top supporting area (2), the top link 

blocks (4) and/or the top spring bolts (3). 
Link hanger according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the supporting area (7) of the link block (5) is 

provided with a recess (8), or the spring bolt (3) in the 
supporting area (7) is provided with a flattening (9). 
Link hanger according to Claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that the links (1) are arranged spread 

apart from one another in the transverse direction of the 
wagon. 
Link hanger according to Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the links (1) are designed to be 

flattened and/or narrowed down at their corners (10) and  
 

single or multiple connecting webs (12) are arranged 
between the frame stems (11) below and above the link 

blocks (4;5). 
Link hanger according to Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that a screw connection (13) for the 

anti-rotation locking of the spring bolt (3) is provided 
between the links (1) on the spring-bracket bearing (15).
