<ABSTRACT>
A telephone set includes a ROM (2) which stores a list of 
STD codes corresponding to local calls. On a telephone 

number being entered, a microprocessor (1) searches the ROM 
(2) for the STD code, if any, of the entered number. The 

microprocessor (1) then controls the operation of the 
telephone set on the basis of this comparison. 
In one embodiment, if no match is found, a DTMF signal 
generator (5) is caused to apply a network selection signal 

to the subscriber line (6) before applying the subscriber 
dialling signal. If a match is found, the network selection 

signal is omitted. Other embodiments provide for 
restriction of use of the telephone set to local calls and 

restriction of the duration of long distance calls.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a telephone set comprising 
dialling command input means, for example a keypad, and 
dialling signal generating means, such as a DTMF generator, 
for applying dialling signals to a subscriber line in 
response to operation of the dialling command input means. Conventional telephones provide only limited control over 
telephone bills. For instance, limiting unauthorised calls 
has tended to involve physically locking the telephone. 
Such arrangements are inconvenient and lack flexibility. It is an aim of the present invention to provide a telephone 
set capable of providing a subscriber with enhanced control 
over his telephones bills. A telephone set according to the present invention is 
characterized by memory means storing data defining a group 
of at least one area routing code and processing means 
arranged to compare the area routing code of a telephone 
number, input from the dialling command input means, with 
each member of said group and control the operation of the 
telephone set in dependence on said comparison. The flexibility of the present invention is illustrated by  
 
a first preferred embodiment which will now be discussed. In the United Kingdom two main telephone networks operate in 
parallel; a third network operates locally in the Hull area. 
Both main network providers have their own trunk networks. 
However, these networks are often accessed by a subscriber 
along a common subscriber line. Differences in the charging 
schemes of the network providers mean that it is 
advantageous for a subscriber to choose between the networks 
on a call by call basis. An example is where network 
provider A charges more than network provider B for long 
distance calls whilst network provider B charges more for 
more local calls. Furthermore, there are certain special 
numbers which are unique to one network. For instance, 0800 
numbers allocated by British Telecom. Telephones are known that are provided with a button, by 
which a subscriber may choose a particular network provider. 
Systems are also known, such as that operating in the United 
States of America, where a subscriber selects a network by 
dialling predetermined digits before the area routing code. 
However, these suffer from the problem that the subscriber 
must be aware of the relative charging rates of the network 
providers for different types of call. This problem has been addressed by a device disclosed in GB-A-2202410.  
 
The described device comprises a unit which is

<CLAIMS>
A telephone set comprising: dialling command input 
means (3) and dialling signal generating means (5) for 

applying dialling signals to a subscriber line (6) in 
response to operation of the dialling command input means 

(3), characterized by memory means (2) storing data defining 
a group of at least one area routing code and processing 

means (1) arranged to compare the area routing code of a 
telephone number, input from the dialling command input 

means (3), with each member of said group and control the 
operation of the telephone set in dependence on said 

comparison. 
A telephone set according to claim 1, wherein the 
processing means (1) is arranged to cause the dialling 

signal generating means (5) to apply selectively a network 
access signal to the subscriber line (6) before the dialling 

signal generating means applies a dialling signal generated 
in response to operation of the dialling command input means 

(3) thereto on the basis of said comparison. 
A telephone set according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the 
processing means (1) is operable to selectively disable the 

dialling signal generating means (5) on the basis of said 
comparison. 
A telephone set according to claim 3, wherein the 
processing means (1) is responsive to a code input using the 

dialling command input means (3) to become operative for 
selective disabling of the dialling signal generating means 

(5). 
A telephone set according to any preceding claims, 
wherein the processing means (1) is operable to selectively 

terminate a telephone call after a predetermined time on the 
basis of said comparison. 
A telephone set according to claim 5, wherein the 
processing means (1) is responsive to a code input using the 

dialling command input means (3) to become operative for 
selectively terminating telephone calls. 
A telephone set according to any preceding claim, 
wherein the memory means (1) stores data defining a 

plurality of groups of area routing codes, the telephone set 
further including input means (3) for inputting group 

selecting data and the processing means (1) being responsive 
to said group selecting data to select the defined group in 

the memory means (2) for said comparison. 
A telephone set according to claim 7, wherein the 
memory means (1,2) comprises a ROM storing data defining a 

 
plurality of groups of area routing codes and a rewritable 

memory (1) storing the data defining the selected group. 
A telephone set according to any preceding claim, 
wherein the data defining the or each group defines at least 

one area routing code in a predetermined charge band. 
A telephone set according to any preceding claim, 
wherein leading digits are omitted from said comparison. 
A telephone set according to claim 10, wherein only the 
third and successive digits are used for said comparison. 
A telephone set according to any preceding claim, 
wherein the or each group is stored in the memory means (2) 

in the following manner: 
STD:L1-STD:L2-STD: ..... :Ln-STD:TERM 

where STD is the subscriber's area routing code, L1-STD...Ln-STD 
are area routing codes representing the codes 

in a predetermined charge band for said subscriber and TERM 
is an end of group code. 
A telephone set according to any preceding claim, 
wherein the telephone set is powered from the subscriber 

 
line voltage. 
A telephone set according to any preceding claim 
including means (1,5) for receiving data defining a group of
