<ABSTRACT>
Described is a system for controlling a fuel-metering device, in particular for a diesel engine. First means generate a first signal for the control of a first controlling device (115) which determines the start and end of fuel feed. Second means generate a second signal for the control of a second controlling device (125) which determines the feed rate, the second means take into account a signal characteristic of the start of fuel feed.

<CLAIMS>
System for controlling a fuel-metering device, 
especially for a diesel-powered internal-combustion 

engine, having first means for generating a first signal 
for the command of a first actuating means (115) serving 

to define the commencement and termination of the feed, 
having second means for generating a second signal for 

the command of a second actuating means (125) serving to 
define the feed rate, the second means taking account of 

a signal which characterizes the commencement of the 
feed. 
System according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that a first observer, on the basis of the first signal, 

determines a correction signal for the correction of the 
second signal. 
System according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the first actuating means is 

constituted by a solenoid valve. 
System according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the first means comprise an injection-commencement 

governing mechanism or a feed-commencement 
governing mechanism, which, depending upon the 

comparison between a desired value and an actual value, 
predefine the first signal. 
System according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the first signal can be corrected 

as a function of the second signal. 
System according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the second means take account of a 

signal (P) characterizing the feed rate.  
 
System according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that a second observer, on the basis of 

the second signal, determines a correction signal for the 
correction of the first signal. 
System according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the second means comprise a feed-rate 

governing mechanism predefines the second signal as 
a function of the comparison between a desired value and 

an actual value. 
System according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the second signal can be corrected 

as a function of the first signal.
