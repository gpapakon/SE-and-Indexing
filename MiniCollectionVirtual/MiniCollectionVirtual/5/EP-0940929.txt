<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a system and method for radio
communications wherein the transmitted signals include an intermediate

frequency in addition to a carrier frequency to aid in demodulation of data
modulated on the signals and regulate the local oscillator frequency at the

receiver. The invention greatly reduces the number of components required to
implement a radio, and in particular, a direct sequence spread spectrum radio,

reduces the frequency stability requirement at the transmitting and receiving ends
of the communication, automatically tracks changes in the transmission signal

after transmission, and permits the use of a single frequency reference to provide
all required frequencies to operate both the receiver and the transmitter in each

radio.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to radio receivers and transmitters, and, more
particularly, to a spread spectrum radio system in which an intermediate frequency
is transmitted along with data and used at the receiver to control a local oscillator.Radio systems using spread spectrum modulation techniques are becoming
increasingly popular for a variety of communication applications. In a spread
spectrum system, the transmitted signals spread over a frequency band that is
wider than the minimum bandwidth required to transmit the information being
sent. As a result of the signal spreading, spread spectrum systems have reduced
susceptibility to interference or jamming and enable high data integrity and
security. Moreover, by spreading transmission power across a broad bandwidth,
power levels at any given frequency within the bandwidth are significantly
reduced, thereby allowing such systems to operate outside of certain FCC
licensing requirements. Given these advantages, such communication systems are
becoming desirable for commercial data transmission.A common type of such communication system is a direct sequence spread
spectrum modulation system. In direct sequence spread spectrum, an RF carrier is
modulated by a digital code sequence having a bit rate much higher than that of
the information signal. Typically, the carrier is modulated by two data streams in
quadrature. Each stream includes one phase when the data code sequence
represents a logic one and a 180Â° phase shift when the data stream code sequence
represents a logic 0. Since the digital code sequence includes square-wave half
periods that vary in duration, the spectral power envelope of a direct sequence
modulated signal is represented by [(SIN x)/x]2. This quadrature modulation is 
commonly referred to as quadrature phase shift key (QPSK) modulation. Bi-polar
phase shift key modulation may also be used.During operation, the receiver recovers the signal using two separate
processes. First, the receive signal is down converted from the center frequency
(fc) of the signal's carrier to a fixed intermediate frequency to enable further
processing of the signal. Conventional signal processing techniques, such as those
used in heterodyne radios, can be applied to down convert the received signal.
Next, the spreading code modulation is removed or demodulated to reveal the
information carried in the signal. Demodulating the spread signal is accomplished
by multiplying the signal by a spreading code sequence identical in structure and
synchronization in
