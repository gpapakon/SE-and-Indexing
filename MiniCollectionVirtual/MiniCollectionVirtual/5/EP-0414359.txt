<ABSTRACT>
A missile launching system with an open-ended 
cylindrical container (10) having a bore in which a 

slidable piston (20) is located between the missile (12) 
and a gas generator (14) adjacent the container aft end 

(16). The piston (20) area is substantially the same as 
the container bore at the aft end (16). An internal 

ring (42) forms a reduced area throat for gas exiting 
via the aft end of the container (10) with the ratio of 

the piston area to the throat area, A
p
/A
t
, being 
functionally related to the propellant physical 

characteristics.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a 
system for launching a missile, and, more particularly 
to a system and method of launching a missile from a 
container exhibiting a substantially reduced recoil over 
a large range of gas operating pressures and 
temperatures. It is well known to launch objects such as a 
missile from a container using pressurized gases 
generated by combustion of a suitable fuel, either 
liquid or solid. Recoil forces accompany such launches 
and, if not successfully compensated for in some manner, 
can be detrimental to the launch site or to individuals 
in the vicinity. A variety of techniques have been resorted to 
in the past to compensate for these recoil forces which 
have involved the use of such things as counterweights, 
pneumatic shock absorbers, burst plates and other 
special apparatus or equipment which act to reduce the 
recoil force to an acceptable level. Although 
accomplishing a measure recoil force reduction, 
these prior techniques have not been completely 
satisfactory. In the main, they require special 
apparatus which is either expensive to manufacture or is 
relatively complicated in operation so that reliability  
 
of the overall system operation is undesirably reduced. Prior gas generated launch systems have also 
been accompanied by relatively high levels of noise 
which is undesirable in that the noise is disturbing 
and, in some cases, is actually detrimental to the well 
being of personnel in the launch site vicinity. GB-A-1,222,501 (preamble of claim 1) discloses a missile 
launcher having two combustion chambers. Combustion of the 
propellant charge in the first, high pressure, chamber forces gasses 
into the second, low pressure, chamber. The gasses act on a piston 
to reduce recoil of the launcher.  
 It is a primary aim and object of the present 
invention, as specified in Claim 1 hereinafter, to provide a method and 
system for launching 
an object such as a missile from a container by the use 
of pressurized gas without incurring the heretofore 
encountered relatively large recoil forces. A further object of the invention is the 
provision of such a method and system which can operate 
over an extended range of operating gas pressures and 
temperatures with a substantially reduced amount of 
noise. In the practice of the present invention, an 
elongated, hollow tubular container receives the 
missile, or other object to be propelled, into the 
forward end thereof. A light-weight piston is 
positioned within the interior of the

<CLAIMS>
A missile launching system with 
substantially zero recoil force, comprising:
 
   a container (10) having a continuous bore with 

forward and aft open ends, the bore forward end portion 
being dimensioned for enabling receipt of the missile (12) 

therewithin;
 
   a piston (20) slidingly received within the 

container bore (10) and sealingly contacting an inner surface 
of the container, said piston (20) located substantially 

inwardly of the container aft end (16);
 
   a gas generator (26) axially mounted within the 

container (10) bore inwardly of the container aft end (16) 
containing a supply of a given combustible propellant (34); 

and
 
   ring means (42) mounted within the container 

bore (10) and secured to the container (10) between the gas 
generator (26) and the aft end (16) to define a restricted 

circular throat of an area (A
t
) which is less than the 
bore cross-sectional area (A
e
) at the aft end (16); 
characterised in that said piston (20) has an area (A
p
) 
substantially the same as the bore cross-sectional area 

A
e
 at the aft end (16), and the ratio A
p
/A
t
 has a value 
functionally related to the physical characteristics of 

the given propellant (34) determined by solving 

 
where P
p
 is the pressure in bore acting upon the piston (20), 
P
e
 is the pressure at the container bore aft end (16), and γ 
is the specific heat ratio for the given propellant (34).  

 
A missile launching system as in claim 1, 
in which the container (10) bore is circular in cross-section 

and said piston includes a circular imperforate wall (22) 
enclosed by a continuous rim (24), said rim (24) slidingly and 

sealingly contacting the container (10) bore wall. 
A missile launching system as in claim 1, 
in which A
p
/A
t
 equals about 1.365 corresponding to a γ 
of about 1.272. 
A missile launching system as in claim 1, in 
which the missile (12) weight (Wm), missile (12) velocity (Vm), 

ambient pressure (Pa), area of piston (20) (Ap), and stroke

limiting propellant (34) burning after missile (12) leaves the 

container (10). 
A missile launching system as in claim 4, 
in which A

 equals about 1.365 corresponding to a γ 
of about 1.272. 
A missile launching system as in claim 2, 
in which the gas generator (26) is mounted between the piston (20) 

and ring means (42).
