<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an arrangement (1) for a driving device (2) for sails on a boat and comprises a worm gear (6) acting between the driving device (2) and a sail furling stay and/or a sail furling shaft on the mast. In order, amongst other things, to obtain a compact driving unit, and thus to reduce the space requirements on board the boat in question, the driving device (2) is accommodated internally within a space (11) in the worm gear (6), inside its worm gear screw (12), with the driving device (2) arranged coaxially with the screw (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an arrangement for 
a driving device for sails on a boat and comprises a worm 
gear acting between the driving device and a sail furling 
stay and/or a sail furling shaft on the mast. In previously disclosed driving arrangements for the 
mechanical furling and unfurling of sails on boats, the 
arrangement is bulky because it is attached either 
longitudinally to the driving device, i.e. in such a way 
that an hydraulically or electrically powered motor, for 
example, is connected to the screw of a worm gear at one 
end, or laterally because of drive motors and worm gear 
screws arranged in parallel with one another at the 
transmission device. The presence of such projecting parts 
close to the mast and/or stays on boats has been found to 
be a major disadvantage, since they have often presented 
the risk of injury to crew members as they pass by. The 
mass of the arrangement can also be considerable. US A 3,608,511 shows a boom turning device comprising 
a worm gear mechanism in which a crank hole in a worm screw 
is intended to accommodate the end of a crank for driving 
the arrangement when turning the sails, whilst GB A 
2,226,800 shows a sail driving arrangement which, likewise 
with a driving unit in the form of an electric motor, is 
accommodated with one part in a worm gear screw, more 
specifically in the gear casing. The principal object of the present invention is 
thus, in the first instance, to make available a solution 
to this problem using simple and effectively functioning 
means. Said object is achieved by means of an arrangement 
as per Claim 1.  
 The invention is described below as a preferred 
illustrative embodiment, in conjunction with which 
reference is made to the drawings, in which 
Figs. 1 and 2 illustrate schematically examples of 
a previously disclosed driving arrangement for a foresail, 
shown respectively from the side and from above; Fig. 3 illustrates schematically an example of a 
driving arrangement in accordance with the present 
invention on the mast of a boat, shown looking across the 
longitudinal sense of the mast; Fig. 4 shows the basic arrangement in accordance 
with the present invention; Figs. 5-6 show side views of drive arrangements in 
accordance with the invention; Fig. 7 shows a schematic sectioned view of the 
driving arrangement, essentially along the line VII-VII in 
Fig. 5, and Fig. 8 shows a sectioned view along the line VIII-VIII 
in Fig. 7. An arrangement 1 for a driving device 2 for sails 3,

</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Arrangement (1) for sails (3, 4) on a boat (5) 

1.1 comprising a driving device (2) 
1.2 the driving device (2) acts upon a worm gear 86) 
1.3 the worm gear (6) acts upon a furling stay (7) and or upon a sail furling 
shaft (8) 
1.4 the driving device (2) is a hydraulic motor 
1.5 the hydraulic motor (2) is located in an internal space (11) inside the 
worm gear 86) 
1.6 the hydraulic motor (2) interacts with an internal drive transmission part 
(14) of the worm gear screw (12) in order to be able to operate the worm gear screw (12). 
Arrangement in accordance with claim 1, characterized in that the rear 
end (2B) of the hydraulic motor (2) is mounted in an end wall cover 

(15), which is detachably attachmed to a frame (60) and which exhibits 
openings (16, 17) for the drive fluid, with transport channels (18, 19) 

attached to the respective opening (16, 17).  
 
Arrangement in accordance with any of 
Claims 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 a guide ring (20), 
attached preferably to the rear end wall (15), is arranged 

so as to act between said cover (15) and the motor (2).  
 
Arrangement in accordance with Claim 3, 

characterized in that
 the guide ring (20) encloses and 
centralizes the rear end (2B) of the hydraulic motor (2) 

and is attached laterally (21) to the end wall cover (15). 
Arrangement in accordance with any of the 
preceding Claims 1-4, 
characterized in that
 the 
front end (12A) of the worm gear screw extends through a 

front cover plate (27) for the manual engagement of and 
the application of a driving effect to the worm gear screw 

(12), for example by means of a crank (29), after the 
hydraulic lines (31, 32) have been connected to one 

another. 
Arrangement in accordance with any of the 
preceding Claims 1-5, 
characterized in that
 the worm 
gear screw (12), which is open at one end (12B) in order to 

permit the introduction of the motor (2), is enclosed by 
preferably identical cover plates (15, 27) at its 

respective ends and accommodates the hydraulic motor (2) in 
the central space (11) of the screw, extending coaxially 

with it. 
Arrangement in accordance with any of the 
preceding Claims 1-6, 
characterized in that
 a 
bearing (25) intended for the screw (12) is attached 

axially to the screw (12) and to the frame (60) in order to 
be able to absorb axial forces in any directions, in so 

doing permitting optional sail furling in either a 
clockwise or an anti-clockwise direction.
