<ABSTRACT>
A safety IV catheter includes a unitary, resilient needle guard received in a catheter hub. The needle guard includes a proximal arm or wall that includes an opening through which a needle passes for axial movement. When the needle is retracted from the catheter it releases the force that had previously prevented movement of the needle guard within the catheter hub. This in turn causes the needle guard to snap into a position in which it is clamped onto the needle shaft and in which its distal wall blocks access to the needle tip. In this condition, the spring needle guard and needle can be removed from the catheter hub. A slot or bulge may be formed in the needle shaft that engages with the needle guard after the protected needle and needle guard are removed from the catheter hub, thereby to prevent removal of the protected needle from the needle guard.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to intravenous (IV)
catheters, and, in particular, to a safety IV catheter in which
the needle tip is automatically covered after needle withdrawal
to prevent the health-care worker from making accidental contact
with the needle tip.I.V. catheters are primarily used to administer fluids,
sometimes containing medications, directly into a patient's
vascular system. The catheter is inserted into a patient's vein
by a health care worker by using a handheld placement device
that includes a sharp tip needle. The needle is positioned in
the interior hollow portion of the catheter with its tip
extended slightly beyond the edge of the catheter. The end of
the apparatus opposite the needle tip is made up of the needle
connected to a needle hub which is capable of being held by the
health care worker during the insertion procedure.The insertion procedure contains four basic steps: (1) the
health care worker inserts the needle and catheter together into
the patient's vein; (2) after insertion into the vein with the
needle point, the catheter is forwarded into the vein of the
patient by the health care worker pushing the catheter with his
or her finger; (3) the health care worker withdraws the needle 
by grasping the hub end (opposite the point end) while at the
same time applying pressure to the patient's skin at the
insertion site with his or her free hand; and (4) the health
care worker then tapes the now inserted catheter to the
patient's skin and connects the exposed end of the catheter, the
catheter hub, to the source of the fluid to be administered into
the patient's vein.The problem is that immediately after the withdrawal of the
needle from the patient's vein, the health care worker who is,
at this time, involved in at least two urgent procedures must
place the exposed needle tip at a nearby location and address
the tasks required to accomplish the needle withdrawal. It is
at this juncture that the exposed needle tip creates a danger of
an accidental needle stick occurring, which under the
circumstances, leaves the health care worker vulnerable to the
transmission of various, dangerous blood-borne pathogens,
including AIDS and hepatitis.This danger to the health care worker from accidental
needle sticks has caused an impetus for the development of a
safer IV catheter in which the occurrence of such accidental
needle sticks is prevented. Safety catheters that have been
developed to achieve this result are disclosed, for example, in
