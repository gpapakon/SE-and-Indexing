<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the design and layout
of integrated circuits (ICs) in technologies such as
complementary metal-oxide silicon (CMOS as defined more broadly
herein). Specifically, the invention relates to protection of
CMOS ICs from transients such as electrostatic discharges (ESD)
that may be applied to the terminals of the IC. This is
accomplished through the use of a circuit that provides an
intentional, forward-biased shunt path between the VDD and VSS
power supply rails upon the appearance of a transient on the
terminals of the IC to discharge the transient without
subjecting the IC circuit to excessive or fatal voltage and
current spikes.Unless potentially elaborate precautions are taken,
electrostatic charges build up whenever non-conducting objects
rub. Usually electrostatic charges dissipate harmlessly, but if
they happen to discharge through an IC they can render the IC
permanently non-functional. If an IC such as a CMOS IC is too
sensitive to electrostatic discharge, then routine handling of
the IC, or of circuit boards containing it, can destroy it. One of the common methods used to evaluate the
electrostatic discharge protection of an IC is the human body
model, which is defined in MIL-STD 883C METHOD 3015.6. This
evaluation method requires the discharge of a 100 pF capacitor,
typically charged to 2000 volts, through a 1500 ohm resistor
into one terminal of an IC under test, while grounding some
other terminal of the IC. The higher the voltage that can be
discharged through the IC without causing its functional
failure, then the better its ESD protection. Other methods used
for evaluating ESD protection are the machine model and the
charged device model.Various structures have been fabricated as part of CMOS and
CMOS-like ICs to protect them from the destructive effects of
ESD. Figure 1 shows a circuit diagram that is typical of prior-art
protection circuits. ICs typically have numerous input and
output terminals, as well as some terminals that are combination
input/output (I/O) terminals. Figure 1 shows a generic ESD
protection circuit for one input terminal and one output
terminal of a CMOS IC built using a P-type substrate, which is
connected to VSS and in which the N-channel transistors are
fabricated. N-type wells, connected to VDD, are fabricated in
substrate and the P-channel transistors are fabricated within
these N-type wells. Input terminal T1 is protected by diodes D1
and D2, which are large-area diodes between T1 and power supply
rails 101 and 102 for VSS and
