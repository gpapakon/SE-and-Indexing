<ABSTRACT>
A low cost spread spectrum modulator for BPSK, or Binary Phase Shift Keying capable of outputting the high modulation rate and suppressed carrier output needed in spread spectrum systems. The present invention provides high quality BPSK modulation without the double balance mixers as required in the prior art, thereby dispensing with the necessity of complex transistor/potentiometer or diode/transformer arrangements. The present invention provides BPSK modulation utilizing only one transformer (A), which can be adjusted for carrier suppression and two transistors (C, D), FET's, or digital logic gates or the like, allowing the present system to be driven from low power CMOS logic levels, yet producing eight db of gain. The present invention may also be utilized as a frequency multiplier, with the utilization of the appropriately high frequency transistor, FET, digital logic gate, or the like.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Binary Phase Shift Keying Modulation System or Frequency Multiplier1. Field of InventionThe present invention relates to modulators, and more particularly to an improved spread spectrum BPSK, or Binary Phase Shift Keying, Modulation system designed for providing gain, low cost and suppressed carrier output, as well as compatibility with CMOS low power logic modulation drive circuitry. The present invention also teaches a Frequency Multiplier circuit, which is much less costly than tradition¬ al designs currently known.The present system teaches a new, superior, and less costly BPSK modulator and/or frequency multiplier than that contemplated by the prior art, providing a less complicated system while outputting increased gain over prior art modulators.2. Prior Art & General BackgroundPrevious spread spectrum BPSK modulators required conventional balance mixers to produce carrier suppression. These conventional modulators utilized either 1) a complex transistor array in conjunction with a transformer tunable with a potonciometer or 2) two center tapped transformers and four diodes, which arrangement required a high level drive circuit to modulate it, typically +7 to +15 dBM.- 1 - 

 Besides the greater expense, increased complexity thereby contributing the probability of failure, and incom¬ patibility with low power -10 dB CMOS logic drive circuitry, the prior art modulators typically produced on the order of six dB of signal loss, resulting in considerably less satisfactory overall performance when compared to the present invention.3. General/ Summary Discussion of the InventionA low cost spread spectrum modulator is an essential component of a commercially viable spread spectrum communica¬ tions system. While a low cost, high performance modulator has not been contemplated until now, the present invention describes the ideal modulator, designed specifically for Binary Phase Shift Keying or BPSK.The present invention is designed to provide a low cost, efficient, quality and reliable modulation system having sufficiently high BPSK modulation rate, coupled with the suppressed carrier output needed in spread spectrum communi¬ cation systems and the like.Unlike the prior art, which required balance mixers of the sort discussed in the background section supra, the present invention provides a BPSK modulator utilizing only one transformer having the capability of adjusting for maximum carrier suppression, in conjunction with two bipolar transistors, which allows the modulator to be driven from the-2 -
