<ABSTRACT>
A sealing strip (2) of flexible material is mounted 
adjacent a slidably movable window pane (5) in a window 

opening (3) of a motor vehicle. The sealing lip (2) has a 
sealing zone (7,8) with a sealing surface for making 

sealing and sliding contact with the window pane (5). The 
area of the sealing zone (7,8) is interrupted by a wiper 

lip (6) which extends outwardly into wiping contact with 
the window pane (5) and can flex in contact with the 

sliding movement of the window pane (5). A cavity (9) 
positioned immediately behind the wiper blade (6) also 

enables the wiper lip (6) to move in a direction 
perpendicular to the sliding movement of the window pane 

(5), thus enabling the wiper lip (6) to accommodate 
tolerances in the horizontal position of the window pane 

(5).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a sealing and wiping arrangement made 
of flexible material for sealing and wiping against a slidably 
movable window pane in a window opening of a motor vehicle, 
comprising a longitudinally extending strip arranged for mounting 
alongside an edge of the window opening adjacent the path of 
sliding movement of the window pane, the material of the strip 
defining a surface having a sealing zone for making area sealing 
contact with the sliding window pane, a cavity in the material 
of the strip and having a resilient outer wall portion extending 
longitudinally of the strip and defining at least part of the 
said surface, a protrusion on the outer wall portion of the 
cavity and extending both longitudinally along the strip and 
towards the path of sliding movement of the window pane so as to 
wipe the window pane as the latter slidably moves, the protrusion 
being resiliently movable with the resilient outer wall portion 
of the cavity in directions substantially perpendicular to the 
sliding movement of the window pane. Such an arrangement is shown in GB-A-2 221 238. In this 
arrangement, the strip comprises a longitudinally extending 
cavity whose outer wall portion carries the surface with the  
 
sealing zone thereon as well as the protrusion. Movement of the 
protrusion in the direction substantially perpendicular to the 
sliding movement of the window glass depresses the outer wall 
portion into the cavity and thus moves the sealing zone away from 
the window glass. Such an arrangement therefore reduces the 
sealing effectiveness of the sealing zone. The invention aims 
to overcome this problem. Such an arrangement is also shown in US-A-5 085 005. Again, 
however, the sealing zone extends over the outer wall portion of 
the cavity and may be lifted off the window pane by the movement 
of the protrusion. The zone cannot therefore provide continuous 
sealing contact against the window pane. The invention aims to overcome this problem. Therefore, the known arrangement as first set forth above (GB-A-2 221 
238) is 
characterised, in accordance with the invention, in that the 
protrusion is in the form of a wiper blade which is also 
resiliently movable relative to the said surface in the 
directions of sliding movement of the window pane, and in that 
the cavity and the outer wall portion thereof are local to the 
wiper blade so that the position of the strip relative to the  
 
path of sliding movement of the window pane, and the area contact 
of the sealing zone with the

A sealing and wiping arrangement made of flexible material 
for sealing and wiping against a slidably movable window pane (5) 

in a window opening (3) of a motor vehicle, comprising a 
longitudinally extending strip (2) arranged for mounting 

alongside an edge of the window opening (3) adjacent the path of 
sliding movement of the window pane (5), the material of the 

strip (2) defining a surface having a sealing zone (7,8) for 
making area sealing contact with the sliding window pane (5), a 

cavity (9) in the material of the strip and having a resilient 
outer wall portion extending longitudinally of the strip (2) and 

defining at least part of the said surface, a protrusion (6) on 
the outer wall portion of the cavity (9) and extending both 

longitudinally along the strip (2) and towards the path of 
sliding movement of the window pane (5) so as to wipe the window 

pane (5) as the latter slidably moves, the protrusion (6) being 
resiliently movable with the resilient outer wall portion of the 

cavity (9) in directions substantially perpendicular to the 
sliding movement of the window pane (5), characterised in that 

the protrusion is in the form of a wiper blade (6) which is also  
 

resiliently movable relative to the said surface in the 
directions of sliding movement of the window pane (5), and in 

that the cavity (9) and the outer wall portion thereof are local 
to the wiper blade (6) so that the position of the strip (2) 

relative to the path of sliding movement of the window pane (5), 
and the area contact of the sealing zone (7,8) with the window 

pane (5) are substantially unaffected by any said movement of the 
wiper blade (6), and the surface of the sealing zone (7,8) acts 

as a continuous seal against the window pane (5). 
An arrangement according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the sealing zone (7,8) is interrupted in the region of the wiper 

blade (6). 
An arrangement according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that the cavity (9) is a cavity which is closed by the outer wall 

portion thereof. 
An arrangement according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that the cavity (9) is in the form of a channel, the outer wall 

portion (10) extending across the mouth of the channel from one 
longitudinally extending edge of the mouth towards but not 

connected to the other longitudinally extending mouth edge  
 

whereby the outer wall portion (10) can flex inwardly of the 
cavity (9) in response to movement of the wiper blade (6) in the 

said perpendicular directions. 
An arrangement according to any preceding claim, 
characterised in that the said surface is formed with a 

longitudinally extending recess (13) the base of which is formed 
by the outer wall portion. 
An arrangement according to any preceding claim, 
characterised in that the wiper blade (6) has a triangular cross-section 

head integrally mounted on a narrowed and flexible web 
(12). 
An arrangement according to any preceding claim, 
characterised in that the material of the strip has an embedded 

metal reinforcement (15).
