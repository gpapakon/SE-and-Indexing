<ABSTRACT>
A device, having a risk estimator (5), stored pressure index (2), and decompression advice optimizer (3), and a method for advising an individual, such as a diver, aviator, or caisson worker, how to proceed from a high ambient pressure to a lower one in a minimum amount of time without exceeding a specified acceptable risk of suffering decompression sickness. The central algorithm is calibrated to reliably estimate instantaneous risk for the pressure exposures and functions to rapidly provide the optimum or fastest return to lower pressure.

 Description CONTROLLED RISK DECOMPRESSION METERField of the InventionThis invention relates to a meter and method of controlling decompression risks. More specifically the invention relates to a device and method whereby at least ambient pressure, breathing gas composition, and time are sensed or simulated, processed and the resulting information, or physical control signals, are sent to a display available to the person assuming a decompression risk or debit such as a diver, aviator, space traveler or other person moving from a high ambient pressure environment to a low pressure environment. In an alternative embodiment the signals are sent to a pressure control system to allow people to decompress at a predetermined level of safety. Description of the Prior ArtDecompression sickness (DCS), sometimes called bends, is a hazard to people who are subject to a reduction in atmospheric pressure. That condition occurs in divers when they return to a pressure of one (1) atmosphere (ATA) from the deep portion of their dive, in pressurized caisson workers when they leave their pressurized job site, and in aviators and astronauts who are deliberately subjected to lower than normal atmospheric pressure.Despite much research, the detailed causes of DCS remain unknown, although most experts feel that a central role is played by expanding gas bubbles. Bubbles are possible because inert gases such as atmospheric nitrogen dissolve in body tissues up to a hmit determined by atmospheric pressure, and when the pressure is reduced, the prior dissolved gas is in excess of the new atmospheric limit, termed "gas supersaturation" and has a thermodynamic tendency to form bubbles.Because a full valid theory is lacking, all methods to avoid DCS are empirical; that is, they are based on a knowledge of which methods, by experience, tend to make DCS less likely than other methods. Nearly all methods embody a mathematical simulation of the amount of gas thought to be in body tissues, and, again by mathematical simulation, seek to limit the amount of supersaturated gas. 

 Since the time of Boycott et al, 1908 [1], "safe" decompression procedures have nearly all been based on putting a maximu-m value on the allowable ratio of gas dissolved in tissues and ambient pressure, a so-called critical supersaturation ratio. Over the years, considerable refinement in the value of the critical supersaturation ratio has occurred. Many of the more modern decompression tables or schedules (collections of rules specifying pauses, or "stops" at
