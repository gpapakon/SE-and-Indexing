<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus 
for transforming thermal energy from a geothermal heat 
source consisting of a mixture of geothermal liquid and 
geothermal steam ("geofluid") into electric power. This 
invention further relates to utilizing the energy 
potential of both geothermal liquid and geothermal steam 
in one integrated system. Geothermal heat sources can generally be divided 
into two groups. In the first group are "liquid-dominated" 
heat sources that produce mostly hot 
geothermal liquid (brine). In the second group are 
"steam-dominated" heat sources that produce mostly 
geothermal steam with some geothermal liquid. Methods for converting the thermal energy released 
by geothermal heat sources into electric power present an 
important and growing area of energy generation. 
Geothermal power plants generally belong to one of two 
categories, namely, steam plants and binary plants. In steam plants, the geothermal source is utilized 
directly to produce steam (e.g., by throttling and 
flashing geothermal liquid). That steam is then expanded 
in a turbine, producing power. In binary plants, heat 
extracted from the geothermal liquid is used to evaporate 
a working fluid that circulates within the power cycle. 
The working fluid is then expanded in a turbine, 
producing power. Steam plants are generally used for steam-dominated 
geothermal heat sources, while binary plants 
are generally used for liquid-dominated geothermal heat 
sources. U.S. Patent No. 4,982,568 describes a method 
and apparatus for transforming thermal energy from  
 
geothermal liquid into electrical power in a binary plant. 
This method increases efficiency by using a thermodynamic 
cycle with a multi-component working fluid and internal 
recuperation. EP-A 372,864 describes a power plant operating on 
steam for producing electric power includes one or more 
integrated power plant unit modules each having a steam 
turbine responsive to the steam and producing heat depleted 
steam, a steam condenser associated with the steam turbine 
operating at a pressure no less than atmospheric pressure 
for condensing the heat depleted steam and vaporising 
organic fluid applied to the condenser, a closed organic 
rankine cycle turbine operating on the organic fluid, and a 
single electric generator driven by the steam turbine and 
the organic rankine cycle turbine for producing electric 
power. The steam is supplied in parallel to each steam 
turbine in each of the modules. The present invention is defined in the
