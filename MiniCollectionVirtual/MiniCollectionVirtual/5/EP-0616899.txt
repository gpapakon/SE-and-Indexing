<ABSTRACT>
Male and female book binding strips are packaged 
in cassettes (31) and the respective cassettes are 

stacked in male and female hopper stations (66, 116). 
Punched sheets are deposited in a staging station. The 

components of the book are then assembled in an assembly 
station (121). Thus the stack of sheets is fed onto one 

jaw and one male strip is fed onto that jaw while a 
female strip is fed onto the opposite jaw superimposed 

above the first-mentioned jaw. The two jaws (123, 136) 
are moved toward each other until the stack is loosely 

held therebetween. Thereupon the jaws are pivoted to 
vertical position, the stack resting on a base plate 

attached to one jaw. The stack is jogged so that the 
holes in the sheets are aligned with each other and with 

the holes in the female strip. The male strip is pushed 
inward toward the stack, the studs fitting through the 

holes in the sheets and through the female strip. The 
assembled stack and strips are then moved into a bind 

station (201) where the strips are compressed together, 
excess stud length cut off and rivet heads formed on the 

severed ends of the studs.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to bookbinding and particularly, 
apparatus and method 
for automatically justifying sheets which are punched 
with holes spaced inward from one margin of the sheet 
by squaring the said one margin and two end margins 
so that the holes of the sheets are aligned, 
assembling such sheets with male and female plastic 
binding strips and then binding the sheets into books 
by compressing the strips so that the studs of one 
strip pass through the holes in the paper and the 
holes of the other binding strip, and then cutting 
off the excess stud length and forming rivet heads on 
the ends of the studs. As hereinafter described in detail, the machine has a 
frame supported above the floor on which are mounted 
several stations or subassemblies. At the staging 
station the sheets to be bound are deposted on a tray 
from which they are fed into the assembly station. 
Male binding strips packaged in cassettes are 
deposited in a male strip hopper and fed one at a  
 
time from the cassette and then fed laterally into 
the justify/assembly station. Simultaneously, in a 
female strip hopper the strips are fed one at a time 
from a cassette and then cross-fed laterally into the 
justify/assembly station. In the justify/assembly 
station, the sheets are jogged so as to square the 
edges of the sheets in common planes and thereby 
align the holes in the sheets. After such 
justification is completed, the male strips are 
pushed inward through the aligned holes in the 
sheets and through the holes in the female strip and 
then the assembled document is fed into the binding 
station. The binding station may be of several types 
using, for example, substantial portions of the 
machine shown in U. S. Patent 3,811,146, whereby the 
strips are compressed together, thereby compressing 
the sheets therebetween, the excess stud lengths are 
cut off and heads are formed on the severed ends of 
the studs, binding the book together. Books of the general type of the end product of the 
present invention are shown, among other places, in 
U.S. Reissue Patent 28202. Such books employ male 
and female binding strips such as are shown in Figs. 
1 and 2 of U.S. Patent 4,369,013. As has been 
stated, the binding station of the apparatus of the 
present invention employs a substantial portion of 
the machine shown in U.S. Patent 3,811,146. 
Initially, the strips are packaged in cassettes.  The apparatus of the present invention has several 
stations. In the staging station, the punched sheets are 
deposited
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A binding station for a bookbinding machine in 
which a plurality of sheets formed with first holes 

spaced from but adjacent an edge of said sheets and 
spaced apart in intervals, a male strip having studs 

projecting therefrom the same intervals as said first 
holes and a female strip having second holes spaced at 

the same intervals as said first holes are assembled at a 
receiving means and cutting means 
for cutting off excess 
lengths of said studs, said binding station comprising 

   a book support plate on which the spine of 
said assembled sheets and strips rests, a platen 

supporting one side of said book, the studs of said male 
strip extending through said platen, a compressor 

reciprocable toward and away from said platen to compress 
said male and female strips and the sheets therebetween 

together, first drive means reciprocating said compressor 
and second drive means for reciprocating said platen 

toward and away from said cutting means. 
A binding station according to claim 1 in 
which said platen is elevated above said book support 

plate in a gap of a width slightly greater than the width 
of said female strip, a female strip guard attached to 

said platen and normally obstructing said gap 
sufficiently to hold the female strip in front of said 

platen and cooperating means on said female strip guard 
and said second means to raise said female strip guard 

out of said gap as said platen approaches said second 
means. 
A binding station according to claim 1 or 
claim 2 which further comprises a conveyor in said 

binding station on which said assembled sheets and strips 
rest during actuation of said second means and drive 

 
means for the conveyor to drive a bound book away from 

said binding station. 
A binding station according to any one of 
claims 1 to 3 which further comprises third means in said 

binding station for securing studs cut by said second 
means to said female strip.
