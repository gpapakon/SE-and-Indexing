<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing a multi-layer film having a 
plurality of synthetic resin layers laminated on a 

releasable flat substrate by casting, which comprises 
firstly forming on the substrate a synthetic resin layer 

having adhesive or sticking properties, and then casting 
and curing on the synthetic resin layer having adhesive 

or sticking properties at least one kind of reaction-curable 
resin raw material mixture substantially free 

from a solvent to form at least one cured synthetic resin 
layer, so that the uppermost layer is composed of a cured 

synthetic resin superior in surface properties to its 
adjacent layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
producing a transparent multi-layer film of high optical
quality which is useful as laminated on a transparent
resin sheet or a glass sheet primarily to improve the
safety.Such generic processes are known from EP-A 0 430 769 and
BE-A 856 398. Particularly, BE-A 856 398 discloses a multi-layer
sheet of synthetic materials for the preparation of a
laminate, wherein the surface layer on one side of said sheet
comprises a thermoplastic material capable of adhering to said
laminate, and the surface layer on the other side comprises a
thermosetting material having desired properties, e.g. self-healing
properties. This sheet can be produced e.g. by first
forming a thermoplastic polyurethane film on a releasable
substrate, and then casting and curing a thermosetting
polyurethane film on said thermoplastic polyurethane film.Heretofore, processes for producing a multi-layer
film by casting unreacted liquid starting materials on a
substrate, have been proposed as disclosed in Japanese
Unexamined Patent Publications No. 162618/1981 and No.
59815/1982 and US Patents 4,935,264 and 5,084,325. In
these processes, the multi-layer film is laminated on a
glass sheet or a transparent resin sheet by coating an
adhesive or sticking agent on the side opposite to the
side which is in contact with the substrate.
Accordingly, if fine defects such as scratch marks are
present on the substrate surface, such defects will be
transferred to the film surface and form defects for the
optical quality of the laminated product. Therefore, the 
substrate is required to have an excellent optical
quality as well as flatness, and it is common to employ a
glass or a linear polyester film of high quality as the
substrate. However, in the case of the glass sheet,
continuous film forming is impossible, and in the case of
the linear polyester film, it has been difficult to
completely eliminate fine defects from the film surface.It is an object of the present invention to provide a
process for producing a multi-layer film, whereby the
conventional problem such that the optical quality is
deteriorated by the transfer of the defects of the
substrate to the film surface, is solved, and to provide
such a method, whereby continuous film-forming is
possible.The present invention is directed to the following
invention which makes continuous film-forming possible by
using a film as the substrate and which at the same time
is capable of overcoming the problem of fine defects on
the substrate surface by a

<CLAIMS>
A process for producing, by casting, a multi-layer film (4) having a plurality of
synthetic resin layers laminated on a releasable flat substrate (1) by firstly

forming on the substrate (1) a synthetic resin layer (15) having adhesive or
sticking properties, and then casting and curing on the synthetic resin layer (15)

having adhesive or sticking properties a reaction-curable resin raw material
mixture to form a cured synthetic resin layer, 
characterized in that
 at least two
kinds of reaction-curable resin raw material mixtures substantially free from a

solvent are sequentially cast and cured on the synthetic resin layer (15) having
adhesive or sticking properties to form at least two cured synthetic resin layers,

so that the uppermost layer (17) among the cured synthetic resin layers is
composed of a cured synthetic resin superior in surface properties to its

adjacent inner cured synthetic resin layer and wherein in the casting of
reaction-curable resin raw material mixtures, before a first reaction-curable

resin raw material mixture already cast, is sufficiently cured by reaction, a
second reaction-curable resi
n raw material mixture is cast thereon, and then
both mixtures are sufficiently cured by reaction.
The process according to Claim 1, wherein the synthetic resin layer (15) having
adhesive or sticking properties, is a layer (15) made of a thermoplastic resin.
The process according to Claim 1 or 2, wherein the synthetic resin layer (15)
having adhesive or sticking properties, is a layer of a thermoplastic resin

formed by casting and curing a reaction-curable resin raw material mixture
substantially free from a solvent.
The process according to Claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein a solution or dispersion of a
thermoplastic resin is cast and applied on the releasable flat substrate (1) to 

form a thermoplastic resin layer (15) having adhesive or sticking properties.
The process according to Claim 2, 3 or 4, wherein the thermoplastic resin is a
thermoplastic polyurethane resin.
The process according to Claim 1, wherein each of said at least two kinds of
reaction-curable resin raw material mixtures is a reaction-curable resin raw

material mixture which is curable by reaction to form a polyurethane resin, and

reaction curable resin raw material mixture which is capable of forming a
crosslinked polyurethane resin having a good self-healing property.

continuously produced by carrying out the casting of the plurality of synthetic

resin layers on a continuously moving substrate (1).
The process according to Claim 1, wherein a thermoplastic resin layer with a

on a continuously moving substrate (1), then a first reaction-curable resin raw
material mixture capable of forming a polyurethane resin having high strength,

is cast thereon, further a second reaction-curable resin raw material mixture
capable of forming a crosslinked polyurethane resin having a good self-healing

property, is cast thereon before the first reaction-curable resin raw material
mixture is sufficiently cured by reaction, and thereafter the first and second

reaction-curable resin raw material mixtures are simultaneously sufficiently
cured by reaction to form two layers comprising a first polyurethane resin layer

having a thickness of from 400 to 1500 µm and a second crosslinked
polyurethane resin layer having a thickness of from 50 to 300 µm.
