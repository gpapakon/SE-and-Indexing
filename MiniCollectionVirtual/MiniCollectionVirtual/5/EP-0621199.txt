<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a closure (1) for a container (2), the closure (1) 
having a lid (3) hinged to a 

base (5). The base (5) of the closure (1) has structure (15) for 
locking the closure (1) on a dispensing 

nozzle (7) of the container (2). The closure (1) has tamper evidence 
structure, to indicate 

whether the lid (3) and base (5) have been separated (that is, 
whether the closure has 

previously been opened). The tamper evidence structure includes a tear 
band (19); the 

closure (1) cannot be opened without removal of the tear band (19). The 
closure (1) is 

configured, and positioned relative to the dispensing nozzle (7), such 
that relatively 

little area of the closure (1) contacts the material dispensed from 
the container (2) as the 

material is dispensed, thereby reducing absorption of material 
components (e.g., flavors and/or oils of the material dispensed) 

by the closure. The top surface of the 
closure lid is configured such that the container (2) and closure (1) 

can be stably stood on 
end on the closure lid (3) when the lid (3) is in the closed position. 

The closure (1) can be 
held at least two positions on the dispensing nozzle (7), a first 

position where the 
closure (1) is locked on the dispensing nozzle (7) and a second position 

where the 
closure (1) is held on the dispensing nozzle (7) but not locked thereon.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an assembly of a container (e.g., a container
for dispensing a viscous product), and a closure having structure indicating whether the closure
has previously been opened (that is, having tamper evidence structure)
according to the preamble of claim 1. In
particular, the present invention is directed to such
an assembly comprising a
closure for a collapsible tube
dispensing container. The present invention relates to such
an assembly comprising
a closure, having
such tamper evidence structure indicating whether the closure has previously been
opened, wherein absorption by the closure, of components of material to be
dispensed from the container, is avoided.More particularly, the present invention is directed to
an assembly of a container and
a closure having a
snap hinge connecting a base and a lid of the closure, the closure having such
tamper evidence structure which acts as evidence that the closure has been
tampered with (that the closure has previously been opened), such closure being
used on a dispensing container having a dispensing nozzle. Especially, the
present invention is directed to such
an assembly comprising
a closure for a collapsible tube dispensing
container containing a dentifrice (e.g., a toothpaste or gel), and wherein absorption
by the closure of oils and flavors from the dentifrice, as the product is dispensed, is
avoided.Various closures having a closure base and a closure lid connected by, e.g.,
a snap hinge, to be used on a dispensing tube having a dispensing nozzle, have
been known and used in the art for a number of years. For example, an early
closure of this type is shown in U.S. Patent No. 1,928,445, which discloses a
rubber hinge connecting a cap to a base portion. The base is a threaded annular
shaped member attached to a threaded dispensing outlet of a tube, the cap portion 
being hinged to the base and can be manipulated from a closed position to seal off
the outlet of the tube to a fully opened position. This closure has a rubber film
hinge attached to a base and cap that will bias the cap either to an open position or
to a closed position.Another form of a captive cap for a tube is shown in U.S. Patent No.
3.933.271. This cap (closure) has a base portion for threading the cap onto a
flexible toothpaste tube, and a cap portion connected to the base by a snap hinge.
When the cap is opened to a point less than an intermediate position, the cap is
biased closed. When the cap is pivoted open to a position past the intermediate
position, the

<CLAIMS>
An assembly of a container (2) having a dispensing
nozzle (7) and locking structure, and a closure (3,5)

secured thereto, the closure comprising:

a closure base (5), having locking structure (15)
cooperating with the locking structure on the container

thereby locking the closure to the said container and a
dispensing channel (17) surrounding the nozzle (7) of the

container (2);
a closure lid (3), cooperatively acting with said
closure base (5) so as to seal the said dispensing

channel (17) when the closure lid (3) is in a closed
position;
hinge structure (21) connecting the said closure
base (5) to the said closure lid (3), and permitting the

closure lid (3) to move between an open and the said
closed position; and
tamper evidence structure (19,35) attached to the
closure base (5) or closure lid (3) and cooperatively

acting with the other of the closure base (5) or closure
lid (3), to which it is not attached, to lock the closure

lid (3) to the closure base (5) until removal of the
tamper evidence structure (19,35), characterised in that

the said dispensing channel (17) which surrounds the
dispensing nozzle (7) sealingly engages at least the end

surface of the said dispensing nozzle (7), and in that
the dispensing nozzle (7) extends such a distance into

the said dispensing channel (17) that the product to be
dispensed, on being dispensed, contacts at most

substantially only a limited surface (20) of the
dispensing channel (17) of the said closure base (5).
An assembly as claimed in claim 1 characterised in 
that the limited surface (20) of the dispensing channel

(17) contacted by the product is less than about twenty
percent of the surface area of the said dispensing

channel (17).
An assembly as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2
characterised in that openings or recesses (27) are

formed between the tear band (19)
forming the tamper evidence structure

and the closure base
(5) or closure lid (3) to which it is attached, and the

other of the closure base (5) or closure lid (3) has nibs
(37) for extending into the said openings (27) between

the tear band (19) and the closure base (5) or closure
lid (3) to which it is attached, for locking the closure

lid (3) and closure base (5) in the closed position.
An assembly as claimed in claim 3 characterised in
that the closure base (5) has an end furthest from the

closure lid, and wherein the tear band (19) extends to the
said end of the closure base furthest from the closure

lid.
An assembly as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4
characterised in that the dispensing nozzle (7) extends

at least through substantially the entirety of the
dispensing channel (17).
An assembly as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5
characterised in that the dispensing nozzle (7) includes

a shoulder (11) between an opening thereof for dispensing
material and a main body of the container, the said main

body being for storing the material; and in that the said
shoulder includes at least one projection (13); and in

that the said closure base includes at least one
projection (15) cooperatively acting with the at least 

one projection (13) on the said shoulder (11) so as to
provide the said locking structure locking the closure

(3,5) to the said container (2), and in that the
container includes structure (47,49) such that the

closure is locked at a first position on the container
and is held, but not locked, at a second position on the

container.
An assembly as claimed in claim 6 characterised in
that the said shoulder includes a first catching area

(47) and a second catching area (49), the first catching
area (47) being located between the said at least one

projection (13) on the shoulder (11) and the main body,
the at least one projection (13) of the closure base

being positioned at the first catching area (47) when the
closure is locked to the container, the second catching

area (49) being located between the at least one
projection on the shoulder and the opening of the

dispensing nozzle, for holding the closure on the
container without locking the closure on the container.
An assembly as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 7,
characterised in that the said container (2) is a container

for dispensing a dentifrice.
