<ABSTRACT>
In an image enhancing method, an input image signal
is lowpass filtered and then histogram equalized to

become a contrast-enhanced signal. Then, the lowpass
filtered signal is subtracted from the input image

signal. Afterwards, the subtracted value is added to
the contrast enhanced signal, and the added result is

output as an image enhanced output signal. Thus, the
contrast of a given image signal is improved without an

increase in background noise.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image enhancing 
method, a device therefor, and more particularly, to an 
image enhancing method which aims to enhance the 
contrast of an image without an increase in noise and a 
device suitable for the method. A histogram of a gray level provides an overall 
description of the appearance of an image. Properly 
adjusted gray levels for a given image can enhance the 
appearance or contrast of the image. Among many methods for contrast enhancement, the 
most widely known one is the histogram equalization, in 
which the contrast of a given image is enhanced 
according to the sample distribution thereof. The 
method is disclosed in documents: [1] J.S. Lim, "Two-dimensional 
Signal and Image Processing," Prentice Hall, 
Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, 1990, and [2] R.C. 
Gonzalez and P. Wints, "Digital Image Processing," 
Addison- Wesley, Reading, Massachusetts. 1977. Also, useful applications of the histogram 
equalization method for medical image processing and 
radar image processing are disclosed in documents: [3] 
J. Zimmerman, S. Pizer, E. Staab, E. Perry, W. 
McCarteney and B. Brenton, "Evaluation of the 
Effectiveness of Adaptive Histogram Equalization for 
Contrast Enhancement," IEEE Tr. on Medical Imaging, pp. 
304-312, Dec. 1988, and [4] Y. Li, W. Wang and D.Y. Yu, 
"Application of Adaptive Histogram Equalization to X-ray 
Chest Image," Proc. of the SPIE, pp. 513-514, vol. 2321, 
1994.  In general, since histogram equalization causes the 
dynamic range of an image to be stretched, the density 
distribution of the resultant image is made flat so that 
the contrast of the image is enhanced as a consequence 
thereof. However, such a widely-known feature of the 
histogram equalization method causes problems in some 
practical cases. That is, since the contrast is 
enhanced by stretching the dynamic range, background 
noise is increased simultaneously by the equalization. 
Thus, the equalization may cause the degradation of 
image quality in a region having a constant level. With a view to solve or reduce the above problem, 
one aim of embodiments of the present invention is to 
provide an image enhancing method for enhancing the 
contrast of an image including Gaussian noise while 
preventing an increase in noise simultaneously by 
lowpass filtering the input image and histogram-equalizing 
the lowpass filtered signal. Another aim of embodiments of the present invention 
is to provide an image enhancing device for enhancing 
the contrast of an image including
