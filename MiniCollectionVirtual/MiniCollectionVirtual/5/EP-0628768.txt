<ABSTRACT>
In order to provide a rotary furnace burner in particular for solid fuels such as fine-grained coal dust, having a nozzle disc (23) which closes off the outer primary-air duct (14), the nozzle disc being easily exchangeable without destruction/renewal of the refractory material (19) of the burner-carrying tube (17), and its air nozzles (16) being able to be adjusted or exchanged conveniently and in an operationally reliable manner, it is proposed according to the invention that the nozzle disc (23) is fitted into the outer primary-air duct (14) while maintaining frontal annular-gap-shaped expansion gaps and is fixed detachably and exchangeably to spacers (26) via fixing means (24) accessible from the front of the burner mouth, the spaces being fixed in the outer primary-air duct (14) to preserve the concentricity of primary-air tube (17) and fuel tube (11).

<CLAIMS>
A burner for a rotary furnace, comprising a duct (10) disposed in a ring for 
pneumatic conveyance of fine-grained solid fuel, e.g. coal dust, and with at 

least one additional annular jet air duct (14) disposed concentrically 
therewith and having an annular nozzle plate (23) secured to its mouth and 

comprising a number of peripherally distributed nozzles (16) through which 
primary air is discharged at high speed, characterised in that the nozzle plate 

(23) is fitted into the annular jet air duct (14), leaving annular expansion 
joints at the ends, and is releasably and interchangeably secured by securing 

means (24) accessible from the front of the burner mouth to spacers (26) 
which are secured in the jet air duct (14) so as to keep the jet air pipe (17) 

concentric with the fuel pipe (11). 
A burner according to claim 1, characterised in that the spacers between the 
jet air pipe (17) and the fuel pipe (11) comprise a one-part or multi-part ring 

(26) disposed in the jet air duct (14) at a slight distance behind the nozzle 
plate (23), as seen from the burner mouth. 
A burner according to claim 2, characterised in that the spacer (23) 
comprises a number of peripherally distributed openings, windows (29) or 

the like for admitting the jet air flow to the nozzles (16) in the nozzle plate 
(23). 
A burner according to any of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the nozzle 
disc (23) can be pressed via a radially inner sealing ring (27) and a radially 

outer sealing ring (28) against the spacer ring (26), and the securing means 
for releasably securing the nozzle plate ring to the spacer ring are bolts (24) 

distributed around the ring periphery and having their axes parallel to the 
burner axis.  

 
A burner according to any of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the nozzles 
(16) in the annular nozzle plate (23) comprise cylindrical nozzle members 

which, without a thread, are rotatable in respective corresponding bores 

distributed around the nozzle-plate periphery, but can each be axially 
secured via a peripheral annular groove (30).
