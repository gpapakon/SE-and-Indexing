<ABSTRACT>
Reduced diffusion of excess mobile specie from a metal oxide ceramic is achieved by tailoring the composition and/or deposition parameters. A barrier layer which reacts with the excess mobile specie is provided below the metal oxide ceramic to prevent or reduce the diffusion of the excess mobile specie through the bottom electrode and into the substrate.

<DESCRIPTION>
 REDUCED DEGRADATION OF METAL OXIDE CERAMIC DUE TO DIFFUSION OF A MOBILE SPECIE THEREFROMThis application claims the priority of provisional application USSN 60/068,040, which was filed on December 18, 1997.Field of the InventionThe invention relates generally to metal oxide ceramic films used in integrated circuits (ICs) . More particularly, the invention relates to reducing or counteracting degradation of the metal oxide ceramic due to excessive loss of a mobile specie from the film.Background of the InventionMetal oxide ceramic materials have been investigated for their use in ICs. For example, metal oxide ceramics that are ferroelectrics or are capable of being transformed into ferroelectrics are useful due to their high remanant polarization (2Pr) and reliable long-term storage characteristics .Various techniques, such as sol-gel, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) , sputtering, or pulsed laser deposition (PLD) , have been developed for depositing ferroelectric 

films on a substrate. Such techniques, for example, are described, for example, Budd et al . , Brit. Ceram. Soc Proc, 36, pl07 (1985); Brierley et al . , Ferroelectrics, 91, pl81 (1989), Takayama et al . , J. Appl . Phys . , 65, pl666 (1989); Morimoto et al . , J. Jap. Appl. Phys. 318, 9296 (1992); and co-pending United States Patent Applications USSN 08/975,087, titled "Low Temperature CVD Process using B-Diketonate Bismuth Precursor for the Preparation of Bismuth Ceramic Thin Films for Integration into Ferroelectric Memory Devices," USSN 09/107,861, titled "Amorphously Deposited Metal Oxide Ceramic Films," all of which are herein incorporated by reference for all purposes .Metal oxide ceramics are often treated with a post- deposition thermal process at a relatively high temperature in order to produce resulting materials with the desired electrical characteristics. For example, some Bi-based oxide ceramics such as strontium bismuth tantalate (SBT) are thermally treated by a "ferroanneal." The ferroanneal converts the as-deposited films into the ferroelectric phase. After the as-deposited films are converted into the ferroelectric phase, the ferroanneal continues, growing the grain size (e.g., greater than about 180 nm) of the films in order to achieve a good remanent polarization. Other 

types of metal oxide ceramics can be deposited as ferroelectrics. For example, lead zirconium titanate (PZT) is often deposited at a relatively higher temperature, such as greater than 500°C, to form an as-deposited film with a ferroelectric perovskite
