<ABSTRACT>
An electrical connector housing (8) was a pair of 
coplanar latch arms (116) which are connected by a U-shaped 

resilient strap (118) at their rear ends. The 
strap (118) has a bight (122) which is connected to the 

housing (8) to provide a pivot point (P) about which the 
latch arms (116) are pivotable between a normal position 

and a latching position. Each latch arm (116) terminates 
forwardly, in a latching head (134) which lies beneath a 

side wall (132) of a hood (60) enclosing the forward end 
of the housing (8). The remainder of each latch arm (116) 

is substantially coplanar with the hood side wall (132) 
whereby the latch arms (116) are in-line with the housing 

(8). The latch arms (116) are connected to the housing by 
way of the bight (122) of the strap (118). The in-line 

location of the latch arms (116) avoids the tangling with 
leads extending from terminals when the housing has been 

loaded with terminals. Moulding of the housing is also 
facilitated and the latch arms are protected against 

damage when the housing (8) is being handled.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a connector housing according to the preamble
of claim 1 and
to a method for forming a
connector housing.There is disclosed in GB-A-1196099, a one piece
moulded electrical connector housing for mating with a
mating electrical connector, the housing comprising a body
having a forward mating face, a rear face, at least one
terminal receiving passage opening into said faces and a
forwardly directed hood for receiving a mating portion of
the mating connector, coplanar latch arms extending from
the housing in the forward direction thereof each
terminating in a latching head with a rearwardly facing
latching shoulder for engaging a corresponding latching
shoulder of the mating connector, the latch arms being
resiliently deflectable between a normal position and a
latching position.In this known connector housing, the latch arms are
connected to opposite sides of the housing in offset
relationship thereto, and are unprotected so that a lead
extending from a terminal in the, or each, passage in the
housing may, when the housing has been loaded with
terminals connected to leads, tangle with the latch arms
when the loaded connector housing is being handled, and
the latch arms are susceptible to damage during handling
of the housing. FR-A-1 455 830 discloses a connector housing having a hood for
receiving a mating connector housing therein, with a resilient cantilever
latching arm being formed within and surrounded by the hood. A
tubular member of the mating connector housing insertable into the hood
comprises a recess latchingly cooperating with a latching projection on
the latching arm. The latching arm is not accessable from outside of the
hood. Therefore, the latching projection and the latching recess have to
be shaped so that the latching engagement therebetween can be released
by pulling both connector housings away from each other with relatively
low pulling forces. For many applications, such a latching structure is
not sufficiently safe against unintentional release of the latching
engagement.The present invention provides a connector housing as defined in claim
1 and a method for making a connector housing as defined in claim 11.
Embodiments of the invention are defined in the dependent claims.According to an embodiment of the present invention, an 
electrical connector housing as defined in the second
paragraph of this specification, is characterized in that
the latch arms comprise at least one pair of latch arms
joined together towards the rear face of the housing by a
resilie
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A connector housing (8) for mating with a mating
connector (6), the housing (8) comprising a body (58), a

hood (60) for receiving a mating portion (164) of the
mating connector (6), and at least one latch arm (116) terminating

in a latching head (134) with a latching shoulder (136)
for engaging a corresponding latching shoulder (179) of

the mating connector (6), the latch arm (116) being
displacable between a normal position and a latching

position,

characterized in that the latch arm (116) is fixed to a
rear portion of the housing (8) and extends into the

hood (60) through a rear opening (130) therein where the
latching arm (116) is actuable from outside the hood

(60) and the latching head (134) is protected by the
hood (60).
A housing as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in
that at least one pair of latch

arms (116) is provided joined together by a resilient strap (118)
that is connected to the housing body (58) to provide a

pivot point (P) about which the latch arms (116) are
deflectable between the normal and latching positions.
A housing as claimed in Claim 2, characterized in
that the resilient strap (118) is substantially U-shaped

comprising a pair of legs (120) connected by a bight
(122), each leg (120) being connected at its end remote

from the bight (122) to the rear end portion of
a respective latch arm (116) and the centre of the bight 

being connected to the housing body (58) to provide said
pivot point (P).
A housing as claimed in Claim 2 or Claim 3,
