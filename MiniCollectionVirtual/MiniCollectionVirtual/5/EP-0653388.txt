<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a glass composition having a neutral 
gray color and a luminous (visible) transmittance within a range that allows 

the glass to be used as privacy glazing in a vehicle. The base glass is a 
soda-lime-silica composition and iron, cobalt, selenium and/or are added as 

colorants. In one particular embodiment of the invention, a neutral gray 
colored glass with a luminous transmittance (C.I.E. illuminant A) ranging 

from 20% to 50% at a thickness of 3.9 millimeters may be attained by 
using as colorants: 0.15 to 1.2 wt. % of the total glass Fe₂O₃ (total iron), 

no greater than 0.30 wt. % FeO, 60-180 PPM CoO, 0-30 PPM Se, and 
0-550 PPM NiO.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention involves a neutral gray colored glass that has a luminous transmittance that makes it highly
desirable for use as privacy glazing in vehicle, e.g. in the rear portions of vans. In particular, the glass of the present
invention has a luminous transmittance range of 20 to 50%. The desired color and performance is attained by using
iron, cobalt, selenium and/or nickel as colorants. In addition, the glass of the present invention generally exhibits lower
infrared and total solar energy transmittance than typical green glasses used in automotive applications to reduce heat
gain in the interior of the enclosure. The glass is also compatible with flat glass manufacturing methods.Various heat-absorbing glass substrates are known in the art. The primary colorant in typical green tinted automotive
glasses is iron, which is usually present in both the Fe2O3 and FeO forms. As is conventional, the total amount
of iron present in a glass is expressed herein as Fe2O3, regardless of the form actually present. Typical green tinted
automotive glass has about 0.5 percent by weight total iron, with the ratio of FeO to total iron being about 0.25.Some glasses, e.g. U.S. Reissue Patent No. 25,312 to Duncan et al., produce a gray color in the glass by
including nickel oxide as a colorant. However, inclusion of nickel containing materials must be carefully controlled
because the presence of nickel during the melting process sometimes leads to the formation of nickel sulfide stones in
the glass. Additional potential problems faced when using nickel include haze formation on the glass surface due to
reduction of the nickel in the tin bath and change in the glass color when it is heat treated.To avoid this problem, nickel-free colored glasses containing iron oxide, cobalt oxide, and selenium were developed
as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,296,004 to Duncan et al., U.S. Patent No. 3,723,142 to Kato et al. and British
Patent Specification 1,331,492 to Bamford. In U.S. Patent No. 4,104,076 to Pons, instead of nickel, Cr2O3 or UO2 are
used in combination with iron oxide, cobalt oxide, and selenium to produce gray glass. A more recent, nickel-free version
of gray glass is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,023,210 to Krumwiede et al. which uses iron oxide, cobalt oxide,
selenium, and chromic oxide as colorants.EP-A 536 049 discloses a colored soda-lime-silica glass composition having a luminous transmittance ranging
from 20% to 60% and a total solar energy transmittance ranging from 10% to 48% at a thickness of 3.85mm. As
