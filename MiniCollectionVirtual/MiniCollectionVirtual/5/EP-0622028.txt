<ABSTRACT>
A flavorant composition is prepared by dispersing 
blue cheese in an aqueous medium containing a buffering 

agent and then incubating the dispersion 
with spores of 
Penicillium roquefortii
 and with 
lipase and protease enzymes to hydrolyze and metabolize 

the cheese.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to compositions employed 
as flavorant additives to foods and particularly 
to preparation of a blue cheese flavorant composition. As is known to those skilled in the art of cheese-making, 
cheeses known as "blue" cheeses are appreciated 
not only as a food per se, but also have distinctive 
flavor characteristics which desirably are employed in a 
variety of foodstuffs. It is known, for example, to 
employ blue cheese itself or flavorants having blue 
cheese flavoring characteristics in oil and water or oil 
and vinegar emulsions for such as dressing green salads. 
The characteristic complexity and "sharpness" of the 
blue cheese flavor also may be employed to add "zest" 
and distinctive character to other bland foods such as 
eggs, for example in omelets, and pastas. As is also known, blue cheese, a semi-soft cheese, 
is prepared conventionally by fermenting milk and/or 
milk products for several months with the mold Penicillium 
roquefortii. As the art attests, however, such 
as illustrated by United States Patent No. 3,072,488, 
the length of the aging period required to obtain the 
desirable distinct flavor characteristics of blue cheese 
is costly in the context of seeking to provide acceptable 
flavorant additives for foods. Moreover, when conventionally fermented cheeses, 
including blue cheese, are employed per se as flavorants, 
not only do these cheeses add significant undesirable 
bulk to the food product, but the products 
also have a relatively short-shelf-life because of the 
presence of fermentation agents. Thus, it is required 
that the processing and/or storage conditions of such 
products be such that the fermentation agents remain inactive. 
Moreover, such products present the possibility  
 
of a consumer experiencing an allergenic reaction because 
of the presence of fermentation agents. In addition, as will be appreciated, consumers expect 
the flavor of products to be consistent from one 
gustatory experience to the next. However, generally, 
if a flavorant system is manufactured on an industrial 
scale with conventional fermentation, final product 
flavor profiles are difficult to control on a statistically 
significant quality control basis, and thus, it 
may be difficult to obtain a consistent final product 
flavor, for example in a batch to batch context. Moreover, 
even if consistency is attained by the manufacturer 
of such a flavorant, consistency of character may 
be lost if a transporter, or a manufacturer of a product 
in which the

<CLAIMS>
A process for preparation of a flavorant composition 
comprising dispersing blue cheese in water containing 

a buffering agent to obtain an aqueous dispersion 
of the blue cheese, incubating the dispersion with 

mold spores of 
Penicillium roquefortii
 and with lipase 
and protease enzymes under submerged agitated aerobic 

conditions at a pH of below 7 at a temperature 
sufficient for the spores and the lipase and protease 

enzymes to hydrolyze and metabolize the blue cheese and 
then heating the incubated dispersion to deactivate the 

mold and enzymes. 
A process according to claim 1 wherein the 
pH is from 5.7 to 6.2. 
A process according to claim 1 wherein the 
dispersion, mold and enzymes are incubated for from 

12 hrs to 36 hrs. 
A process according to claim 1 further comprising 
adding and dispersing heavy cream to and with 

the cheese, water and buffering agent. 
A process according to claim 1 further comprising 
adding and dispersing a lipolyzed cream to and 

with the cheese, water and buffering agent. 
A process according to claim 1 further comprising 
adding and mixing a lipolyzed cream to and with 

the incubated mixture. 
A process according to claim 1 further comprising 
incorporating a preservative composition into  

 
the incubated product for inhibiting growth of molds and 

bacteria in the product subsequent to incubation and 
deactivation. 
A process according to claim 1 further comprising 
removing water from the deactivated product to 

concentrate the product. 
A process according to claim 1 further comprising 
dehydrating the deactivated product to a stable 

moisture content. 
A process according to claim 1 wherein the 
spores are carried on bread crumbs and further comprising 

washing the spores and bread crumbs with a wash 
water containing a surfactant and adding and dispersing 

the spores and wash water to and with the water, buffering 
agent and cheese to prepare the dispersion. 
A process according to claim 1 wherein the 
spores are in an amount of from 10⁶ spores/g 

cheese to 10¹⁰ spores/g cheese, the lipase is in 
an amount of from 0.01 u/g cheese to 0.80 

u/g cheese, the protease is in an amount of from 0.125 
AU/kg cheese to 10 AU/kg cheese. 
The product obtainable by the process of claim 1. 
The product obtainable by the process of claim 4. 
The product obtainable by the process of claim 5. 
The product obtainable by the process of claim 6. 
A product obtainable by the process of claim 9.
