<ABSTRACT>
A hammer stopper (2e) is moved into and outof an 
orbit of an extension (1t) of a hammer shank (1n) depending 

upon an operation mode, and the extension rebounds on the 
hammer stopper in an electronically sound producing mode 

between an escape of a jack (1k) from a butt (1m) and a 
strike of a hammer head (1o) at a set of strings (1d) so 

that a player performs a music through synthesized sounds 
without sacrifice of the piano key-touch.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a keyboard instrument
and, more particularly, to a keyboard instrument
selectively producing acoustic sounds and synthesized
sounds.A piano gives a unique touch to a player, and an
electronic keyboard synthesizer does not exactly imitates
the unique key-touch, and an attempt was made on a
compromise between a piano and an electronic synthesizer.The compromise or the piano-like musical instrument
has key action mechanisms coupled between the keyboard and
the hammer assemblies and a tone generator system, and
sounds are synthesized by the tone generator system.
However, the key action mechanisms drives the hammer
assemblies for striking the strings, and gives the unique
key-touch to the player.However, when a hammer strikes the strings, the
strings vibrate, and produce an acoustic sound. The
acoustic sound is mixed with the synthesized sound, and an 
audience feels the mixed sounds strange.A muting mechanism incorporated in a grand piano is
disclosed in Japanese Publication of Unexamined Utility
Model Application (Kokai) No. 51-67732, and the muting
mechanism restricts a hammer motion by means of a resilient
member. According to the Japanese Publication of
Unexamined Utility Model Application, the hammer
concurrently strikes the resilient member and the
associated strings, and the impact is split between the
resilient member and the strings. As a result, the
strings weakly vibrate, and the sound is lessened.The prior art piano-like keyboard instruments can
decrease the loudness of acoustic sounds. However, the
prior art piano-like keyboard instruments can not perfectly
eliminate the acoustic sounds from electrically synthesized
sounds.If the resilient member is moved to a closer position
to the home position of the hammer, the hammer strikes the
resilient member only, and the acoustic sound is not
produced. However, the resilient member closer to the home
position does not allow the jack to escape from the butt,
and the key action mechanism can not give the unique key
touch to the player. If the hammer is removed, the strings never vibrate,
and acoustic sounds are not mixed with the synthesized
sounds. However, the keys are too light to give an
appropriate resistance against the fingers of the player,
and the key action mechanisms without hammers can not
imitate the unique key-touch.Thus, there is a trade-off between the acoustic
sounds and the key-touch, and all of the prior art keyboard
instruments do not satisfy players.With regard to the further prior art, EP-A-0 573 963
