A plunger lift pipette for an attachable pipette tip (3) which comprises adjusting
means (12) for changing the travel path of the pipette plunger, display means

(20) for displaying the pipetted liquid volume, disengageable coupling means
(19, 25, 26) between the adjusting means and the display means for changing a

pipette correction factor determining the relation between the travel path of said
plunger and the indicated liquid volume, characterized in that said coupling

means are positive coupling means (19, 25, 26) comprising a coupling
component (25) connected to said adjusting means (12), a coupling component

(26) connected to said display means (20) and switching means (21) for
completely disengaging both coupling components from each other and

changing the pipette correction factor by setting said adjusting means, a control
lever (36) of said switching means (21) enabling actuation from the outside of

the pipette body (1).
The plunger lift pipette according to claim 1, characterized in that said positive
coupling means (19, 25, 26) include two spur gears (22, 23) (coupling spur

gears) connected to each other for joint rotation with each other, that said
adjusting means (12) are connected to a spur gear (25) (adjusting spur gear) 

being rotated according to the adjusted travel path of said plunger and said
display means (20) are connected to a spur gear (26) (display spur gear) being

rotated according to the indicated liquid volume, with the one (22) of said
coupling spur gears mating with said adjusting spur gear (25) and the other one

(23) of said coupling spur gears mating with said display spur gear (26), and that
said coupling spur gears (22, 23) are arranged on an axis (24) and supported by a

spring means (34) and are displaceable on said axis from said switching means
(21) contrary to spring action by disengaging at least one coupling spur gear (22,

23).
The plunger lift pipette according to claim 2 or 3, characterized in that said
adjusting spur gear (25) is formed on the shell of an adjusting bushing (12)

projecting from the body.
The plunger lift pipette according to claim 2 or 3, characterized in that said
display spur gear (26) is a drive gear of a counting mechanism (20).
The plunger lift pipette according to the claims 2 or 4, characterized in that said
coupling spur gears (22, 23), said adjusting spur gear (25) and said display spur

gear (26) are arranged on a common basic body (28) with parallel axes (24, 27). 
The plunger lift pipette according to claim 5, characterized in that said axes (24,
27, 40) of said coupling spur gears (22, 23) and said counting mechanism (20)

are anchored within said basic body (28).
The plunger lift pipette according to claim 5 or 6, characterized in that an

adjusting bushing (12) is arranged on a cylindrical hollow shoulder (29) of said
basic body (28) and said shoulder includes an internal thread (16) wherein a

spindle (6) being connected to said adjusting bushing so as to be secured against
rotation can be screwed for the adjustment of the travel path of the pipette

plunger.
The plunger lift pipette according to claim 7, characterized in that said shoulder
(29) at the side facing said plunger (7) receives a spring collar (17) serving as a

lower abutment of said plunger rod (5).
The plunger lift pipette according to claim 7 or 8, characterized in that the end of
said shoulder (29) opposite to said plunger functions as an abutment surface for

an upper abutment (13) of said spindle (6).
The plunger lift pipette according to any of the claims 3 to 9, characterized in
that radial projections (14) of said upper abutment (13) of said spindle (6) 

engage axial internal grooves (15) of said adjusting bushing (12) so as to be
secured against rotation.
The plunger lift pipette according to any of the claims 2 to 10, characterized in
that said switching means (19) comprise a sliding member (35) arranged on said

axis (24) for laterally engaging said coupling spur gears (22, 23).
The plunger lift pipette according to any or the claims 1 to 11, characterized in
that said counting mechanism (20) comprises a locking gear (42) including a

lock-in position for each full reading as well as a locking element (43).
The plunger lift pipette according to any of the claims 1 to 12, characterized in
that said adjusting means on an adjusting bushing (12) projecting from said body

(1) comprise a marking and said body comprises an associated marking, scale or
indicating scale or vice versa.
