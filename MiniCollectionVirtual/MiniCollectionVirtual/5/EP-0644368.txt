A lubricant dispenser for the gas-controlled delivery of a lubricant to a machine, 
having 


a housing (1) for receiving a lubricant supply, 
a machine connection part (2) with a lubricant delivery channel (3) on one side of the 
housing (1), and 
a gas evolution cell (4) on the opposite side of the housing (1) to the connection part 
(2), and having 
an operating piston which is fitted into the housing (1), and the movement of which 
can be controlled by the gas evolved so as to determine the lubricant rate, 
 
wherein the gas evolution cell (4) is designed as an autonomous component which consists 

of a base part (5), a magazine receiver (6) and a cover cap (7) and which can be inserted as 
a base in a recess of the housing (1) and can be fixed therein, wherein the
 cover cap (7) is 
attached to the base part (5) so that it can be pushed off and a magazine having an 

electrochemical gas evolution element (10) accommodated therein can be inserted in the 
magazine receiver (6), 


wherein the cover cap (7) is constructed at the same time as the operating piston, 
wherein the gas evolution element comprises a battery-operated cell (11) to which an 
electrical operating battery (12) is connected which is accommodated in the magazine (9) and 

which can be connected and disconnected according to choice, and  
 
wherein, when the operating battery (12) is connected and when gas evolution is thereby 
effected, the cover cap (7) can be pushed off from the base part (5) and can be moved as an 

operating piston controlling the lubricant rate. 
A lubricant dispenser according to claim 1, wherein a potentiometer resistor (14) is 
associated with the operating battery and is also accommodated in the magazine, and wherein 

the potentiometer resistor (14) is set or is adjustable for the control ofthe gas evolution. 
A lubricant dispenser according to either one of claims 1 or 2, wherein the magazine 
(9) is designed as a cylindrical component, can be screwed into an associated magazine 

receiver (6) in the base part (5) and is closed and externally sealed by a cover. 
A lubricant dispenser according to either one of claims 1 or 2, wherein the magazine 
(9) is designed as a cylindrical component and is inserted externally sealed in a cylindrical 

bushing (16), and can be screwed with the cylindrical bushing (16) into an associated 
magazine receiver (6) in the base part (5). 
A lubricant dispenser according to any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein the magazine (9) 
and/or the cylindrical bushing (16) is formed from synthetic thermoplastic material by 

injection-moulding, as are the other components of the housing (1) including the machine 
connection part (2).
