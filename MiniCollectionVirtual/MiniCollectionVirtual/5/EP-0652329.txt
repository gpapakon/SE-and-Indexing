<ABSTRACT>
In a trigger and interrupt device for a universal discharge valve (toilet flush valve) of a toilet cistern, an axially displaceably guided, essentially single-piece toilet-flush handle (22), which is subjected to the prestressing of a spring and exhibits, on its end side, a hollow (24) and a lug (28) with cross-sectional tapering (31), engages into a pivot-lever mechanism (23) and, depending on the position of the pivot lever (20), either the hollow (24) of the flush handle (22) comes into engagement with the end side (25) of the pressure lever (27) articulated on the pivot lever (20) in the centre of rotation (26) and pivots one arm (32) of the pivot lever (20) downwards around the pivot bearing (33), the lug (28) of the flush handle (22) penetrating into the opening (29) of the pivot lever (20), and the other arm (21) of the pivot lever (20) opens the discharge valve via the actuating rod (16), or the lug (28) of the flush handle (22) comes into engagement with the depression (30) on the arm (21) of the pivot lever (20) and the latter is pivoted downwards around the pivot bearing (33) and, in this arrangement, closes the discharge valve via the actuating rod (16).

A trigger and interrupt device for a universal flush 
va
lve of a toilet cistern with an axially adjustable 
operating press bar, which is held under initial tension 

by a spring and by the activation of which the flush valve 
can be opened and closed, and which engages a pivot lever 

mechanism (23) consisting of a pivot lever (20) capable of 
rotating about a pivot bearing (26) and a pressure lever 

(27) articulated in a pivotal point (26) on an arm (32) of 
the pivot lever (20), characterised in that the 

essentially one-piece press bar (22) comprises at its 
front a trough-shaped recess (24) and a nose extension 

(28) preferably including a cross-sectional narrowing 
(31), whereby the trough-shaped recess (24) lies in a 

position facing the opposite end of the pressure lever 
(27) furthest from the pivot point (26), and the nose 

extension lies in a position facing an opening in the 
pivot lever (20) and a depressed recess in the other arm 

(21) of the pivot lever (20), that the other arm (21) of 
the pivot lever (20) is connected to the activating rod 

(16) of the flush valve, that, on activation of the press 
bar (22) in the closed position of the flush valve, the 

trough-shaped recess overcomes a lifting dead-point and 
then engages with the end of the pressure lever (27) 

furthest from the pivot point (26) and tilts the  
 

particular arm (32) of the pivot lever (20) that is 
pointing upwards when the flush valve is closed, and moves 

it downwards causing it to pivot about the pivot bearing 
(33), whereby the nose extension (28) entersinto the 

opening (29) of the pivot lever (20) and the other arm 
(21) of the pivot lever opens the flush valve by means of 

the activating rod (16), and that, on further activation 
of the press bar (22) when the flush valve is open and 

after the lifting dead-point has once again been overcome, 
the nose extension (28) engages with the depression (30) 

in the other arm (21) of the pivot lever that is pointing 
upwards when the flush valve is open, and pivots it 

downwards about the pivot bearing thereby closing the 
flush valve by means of the activating rod (16). 
A trigger and interrupt device according to claim 1, 
characterised by downward pointing guide bars (34) shaped 

to be incorporated with the press bar and located to the 
right and to the left of the trough-shaped recess (24) in 

order to hold and guide the movement of the front (25) of 
the pressure lever (27). 
A trigger and interrupt device according to claim 1 
or 2, characterised in that the flush valve mounted on the 

flush opening of the cistern and the press bar housing (7) 
of the flush and interrupt device are connected by means  

 
of an adjusting rod (2) and an adjustment casing sleeve 

(1), whereby the adjusting rod (2) can be adjusted within 
the adjustment casing sleeve (1) in order to adjust the 

clearance distance between the press bar housing (7) and 
the flush valve, and, subsequent to the setting of the 

clearance distance, can be firmly locked in position. 
A trigger and interrupt device according to one or of 
the preceding claims, characterised in that the adjustment 

casing sleeve (1) comprises an essentially U-shaped 
profile and includes on its upper side a head element (5) 

and a neck element (4) which is capable of engaging with 
a horizontal groove contained in the base element (6) of 

the press bar housing (7), that a circular-shaped base 
element (8) with inwardly projecting segments (11) is 

arranged on its lower side, that the adjusting rod (2) 
which is attached to the fixed and stationary part of the 

flush valve locates through the opening of the circular-shaped 
base element (8) of the adjustment casing sleeve 

(1) and, in contrast to the adjustment casing sleeve (1), 
is axially freely adjustable after having been thus 

located, and that the adjusting rod (2) includes, along 
its whole length and at clearance distances corresponding 

to the clearance distances of the inwardly projecting 
segments (11) of the adjustment casing sleeve (1), outward 

projecting securing bar sections (12) lying opposite each  
 

other on two sides, into which the segments (11) of the 
adjustment casing sleeve (1) can be screwed in place by 

means of a quarter turn up as far as the side-mounted 
checking stops (13) located on its circular-shaped base 

element (8) and can be locked in position by means of the 
notch projections (14) similarly located on the circular-shaped 

base element (8). 
A trigger and interrupt device according to one or 
more of the preceding claims, characterised in that the 

pin (15) on the upper end of the activating rod (16) is 
engaged with the bearing point (L) on the end of the arm 

(21) of the pivot lever (20) and that the activating rod 
(16), in the region of its lower end and between two of 

the spacing rings (17) which are arranged along the 
activating rod (16) at regular short clearance distances, 

is engaged with a slot (18) in the arm (19) that projects 
sideways from the closing component of the flush valve. 
A trigger and interrupt device according to one or 
more of the preceding claims, characterised in that the 

individual parts of the trigger and interrupt device 
consist preferably of a bend-resistant synthetic material. 
A trigger and interrupt device according to one or 
more of the preceding claims, characterised in that the  

 
individual parts consist partly or entirely of metal 

and/or ceramic materials.
