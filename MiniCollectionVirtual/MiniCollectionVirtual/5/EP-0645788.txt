<ABSTRACT>
An electrochemical capacitor is prepared by assembling 
a stacked assembly of at least two bipolar electrodes (20), 

where each of the bipolar electrodes (20) includes a metal foil 
electrode substrate having a porous, electronically conductive 

substrate coating, preferably porous platinum, on each surface. 
The stacked assembly further has a porous separator layer between 

each of the electrodes (20), made of a material that is electronically 
non-conductive. An ionic conductor electrolyte (30), 

preferably a polyoxometalate, that wets both the substrate 
coating and the separator layer at temperatures above the melting 

point of the solid ionic conductor electrolyte is provided. 
The ionic conductor electrolyte has a melting point above about 

30°C. The ionic conductor electrolyte (30) is introduced into 
the stacked assembly as by external infiltration with an optional 

applied pressure to assist the infiltration.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the production of devices used for 
the storage of electrical energy, and more specifically to a process for producing multi-cell 
solid state electrochemical capacitors and the capacitors produced using such 
method. Devices for the storage of electrical energy can be described as batteries or 
capacitors based upon the mechanisms used for energy storage and the discharge 
characteristics they exhibit. For example, see B.E. Conway, J. Electrochem. Soc., v. 
138, no. 6, pp. 1539-48, 1991. In rechargeable batteries, energy is stored almost 
entirely through reversible oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions. Although a double 
layer exists at the electrode surfaces, it contributes very little to the stored energy. In 
capacitors, a significant amount of energy is stored in the double layer at the electrode 
surfaces, although in some cases, as described by Conway above, a major fraction of 
stored energy is attributable to reversible surface redox reactions. 
As compared to batteries, electrochemical capacitors can be characterized as having 
low energy density, high power density and a high cycle life as described in S. 
Sarangapani et al., Journal of Power Sources, v. 29, pp. 355-64, 1990. Further, in an 
electric circuit, an electrochemical capacitor behaves more like a classical dielectric 
capacitor than a battery, hence its name. The fundamental unit or cell of an electrochemical capacitor consists of two 
electrodes and an electrolyte. Both double layer and redox reactions may occur at one 
or both electrode surfaces. The energy storage of the device is limited by the 
decomposition voltage of the electrolyte and the available electrode surface area. The 
decomposition voltage is the voltage at which non-reversible redox reactions occur 
between the electrode surface and the electrolyte. For example, capacitors utilizing an 
aqueous electrolyte are limited to the potential per cell at which water electrolyzes 
(about 1.2 volts). A capacitor employing a solid electrolyte such as RbAg₄I₅ is  
 
limited to a cell voltage of less than 0.7 volts. There is a continuing search for improved capacitor designs to deliver high 
discharge currents in short pulses upon demand for particular applications. New types 
of capacitors based upon advanced electrochemical systems, sometimes termed 
supercapacitors, offer the promise of increased capacitance and specific capacitance as 
compared to conventional capacitors. However, the existing techniques for the 
production of
