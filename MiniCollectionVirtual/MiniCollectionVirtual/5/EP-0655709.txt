<ABSTRACT>
A novel form and method for creating and using document sized file storage sheets 
(10) containing one or more files (16-22), employing a user model similar to that of a floppy 

disk. A storage sheet comprises at least one sheet (10) of an information storing substrate 
material, commonly paper. A system (30; Fig.2) for the inputting and processing of storage 

sheet images is also disclosed. The storage sheet (10) comprises a machine readable mark, a 
"file storage sheet flag", (12) which alerts the system is currently reading a file storage sheet 

(10). Upon image input, this flag (12) is deliberately scanned for by the system. The storage 
sheet (10) also comprises a machine readable directory (14) that informs the system about the 

general characteristics of the files (16-22) stored on the sheet (10). Such general information 
may include the name of the files (16-22), the number of bytes, creation date, owner, the 

location of the first byte of the file (16-22) on the sheet, and the like. If the current file storage 
sheet (10) comprises more than one sheet, then the directory (14) may inform the system (30; 

Fig.2) where the files (16-22) are located among the separate sheets. A file storage sheet may 
optionally comprises a human readable label (13) and a human readable directory.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to the creation and use of document sized
file storage sheets and, in particular, to file storage sheets that have machine readable files and
a flag which induces a document processing system to store the files.Removable external storage media for computers have existed for many years. In
fact, punched paper cards developed by Jacquard for controlling looms predate the modern
stored program computer. These punched cards have reappeared as removable storage of
both programs and data for early generations of large and mid-sized computers. Similarly,
punched paper tape provided a means for storing information for both mechanical devices
such as teletypewriters and for digital stored program computers.As storage substrate technology improved, the cost of storage decreased while,
simultaneously, the portability of storage increased. These trends are evident in the
development of removable magnetic storage. Initially, mainframe removable packs of rigid
magnetic disks ("disk packs") were used for fast random access. Although disk packs are
comparatively bulky; they are nonetheless portable from mainframe to mainframe. As smaller
computers developed, more portable random access mechanisms for storing small amounts of
data were developed. The eight inch "floppy disk" allowed a modicum of information to be
stored, retrieved, and cataloged off-line. These first floppies were more convenient than either
magnetic tape or disk packs and were much less expensive.Five-and-a-half inch floppy "diskettes" followed, and were dominant for a number
of years. These floppy disks are more convenient for handling and storing than their eight inch
predecessor. Additionally, these floppies stored more information due to advances in substrate
material, recording/playback technology, and processing technology.Recently, a three-and-a-quarter inch "diskette" format has gained commercial
success. No longer "floppy", these diskettes are encased in a semirigid plastic protective shell,
providing a more foolproof product for a wider market. Furthermore, the size and protection
allow for mailing in standard envelopes, or carrying in standard shirt pockets - something not
possible with previous floppy disks.While this improvement has taken place within the magnetic storage technology,
advances in other technologies have also occurred. For example, CD-ROM has grown out of the
compact disk digital audio market in the past ten years.The cost of these media has dropped while their storage capacity has
