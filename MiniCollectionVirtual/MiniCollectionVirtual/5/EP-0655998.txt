<ABSTRACT>
An improved process for the preparation of 2,6-dichloro-5-fluoronicotinoyl chloride is described where a 2,6-dihydroxy-5-fluoronicotinic acid ester is converted in one step using phosphorus oxychloride and a lithium reagent to 2,6-dichloro-5-fluoronicotinoyl chloride and subsequent basic hydrolysis affords 2,6-dichloro-5-fluoronicotinic acid.

<DESCRIPTION>
Substituted pyridines are of interest as 
intermediates in the synthesis of naphthyridine 
antibacterial agents. 2,6-Dichloro-5-fluoronicotinic 
acid and 2,6-dichloro-5-fluoronicotinoyl chloride are 
of particular interest as key intermediates in the 
synthesis of naphthyridine antibacterial agents as 
disclosed in European Published Patent 
Applications 0132,845, 0160,578, 0153,580 and United 
States Patents 4,840,954, 4,649,144, and 4,616,019. A process for preparing 2,6-dichloro-5-fluoronicotinic 
acid is disclosed in European 
Published Patent Application 0333,020. However, this 
process suffers from several major disadvantages. In 
our hands the conversion of 2,6-dihydroxy-3-cyano-5-fluoropyridine 
to 2,6-dichloro-3-cyano-5-fluoropyridine 
using phosphorus oxychloride and 
phosphorus pentachloride produces 2,4,6-trichloro-3-cyano-5-fluoropyridine 
as a byproduct. This 
results in a lower yield of the desired 2,6-dichloro-3-cyano-5-fluoropyridine 
and especially after the 
hydrolysis the products of this trichloronitrile 
contaminate the desired nicotinic acid product. As a 
result, additional purification procedures are 
required to remove the trichloronitrile byproduct. 
Finally, another major drawback is the mediocre 
overall yield (40%-45%) in converting 2,6-dihydroxy-3-cyano-5-fluoropyridine 
to 2,6-dichloro-5-fluoronicotinic 
acid. This may be an inherent 
problem in hydrolyzing the 2,6-dichloro-3-cyano-5-fluoropryridine. 
E. P. Oliveto states "the  
 
hydrolysis of chlorocyanopyridine to chloropyridine 
acids cannot be considered a generally useful 
reaction because 2 and 4 halogens are easily 
hydrolyzed" (see The Chemistry of Heterocyclic 
Compounds, Pyridine and its Derivatives, Part III, 
Weissberger, A (Ed.) Interscience Publishers, New 
York, New York 1962:244). Thus, we have surprisingly and unexpectedly 
found that a 2,6-dihydroxy-5-fluoronicotinate can be 
converted with phosphorus oxychloride in the presence 
of a lithium reagent to 2,6-dichloro-5-fluoronicotinoyl 
chloride which is subsequently converted 
to 2,6-dichloro-5-fluoronicotinic acid. The object of the present invention is an 
improved process for preparing 2,6-dichloro-5-fluoronicotinic 
acid and 2,6-dichloro-5-fluoronicotinoyl 
chloride by using a novel 
synthetic scheme. The present method utilizes inexpensive starting 
materials, proceeds in fewer steps, and affords 
higher yields compared to the previous methods. In 
addition, the present process obviates the need for 
phosphorus pentachloride with its concomitant 
ov
