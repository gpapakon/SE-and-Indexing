<ABSTRACT>
An inertia device for interrupting the current supplied by a 
vehicle battery and in particular for interrupting the hot lines 

and those connected to the gasoline pump, comprising an inertia 
switch (2), a relay (3, 9), a movable contact (4) for connecting 

together a fixed input contact (6) and a fixed output contact (7). 
The input contact (6) comprises a first part (6A) shaped to secure 

and electrically connect the end of a cable (15) for connecting 
the device to the battery (26), and a second part (6B) integral 

with the first and arranged to cooperate with said movable contact 
(4), the input contact being an integral part of the internal 

electrical circuit of the device.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an inertia device for interrupting the 
current supplied by a motor vehicle battery and in particular for 
interrupting the hot lines and those connected to the gasoline 
pump according to the preamble of the attached main claim. Known devices of the aforesaid type are usually connected to the 
positive pole of the battery by a connection member comprising a 
metal bar, the ends of which are fixed by bolts to a positive 
terminal of the battery and to an input terminal of the device 
respectively. Said connection member does not enable the device to be securely 
fixed to the battery, in that the device remains substantially 
suspended to the side of the battery. Consequently the device is 
subjected to vibrations which can compromise the device fixing and 
the correct operation of the inertia switch provided in the 
device. The operations involved in connecting the device to the 
battery are also relatively lengthy and difficult. The point at which the connection member is fixed to the device 
also has generally a smaller cross-section than the internal 
components of the device, this causing a greater voltage drop and 
heating at the connection point than at the other parts of the 
device.  
 In DE 1 465 179 it is described an inertia device for 
interrupting the current supplied by a vehicle battery 
connected to the latter by a cable and comprising a casing 
for the housing of an inertia switch, a relay, a movable 
contact and fixed input and output contacts. The input 
contact is a screw whose threadened portion partially 
projects outside the casing. For the connection of the battery cable to the input 
contact of the device, said threaded portion of the input 
contact cooperates with nuts and a forked element fixed to 
an end of said cable. The connection of the battery cable to the input contact is 
relatively difficult and weighs upon the time needed for 
the assembly of the device into the vehicle. Moreover, because of a possible oxidation of the nuts or 
the forked element and because of a possible unscrewing of 
the nuts, the electrical contact between input contact and 
battery cable may be difficult or even interrupted.  
 An object of the invention is to provide a device having a battery 
connection element which does not have to be fixed to an input 
terminal of the device but instead forms an integral part of the 
device electrical circuit, so as to facilitate, simplify and 
accelerate the operations involved in connecting the device to the 
battery, and prevent
