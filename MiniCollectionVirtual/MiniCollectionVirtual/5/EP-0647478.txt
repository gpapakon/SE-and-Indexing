<ABSTRACT>
A solvent-containing coating composition is 
applied to a work to a thickness larger than a running 

limit thickness and is subjected to a setting step of 
evaporating the solvent in the coating composition 

applied to the work and a hardening step of hardening the 
coating composition after the setting step while the work 

is rotated about a substantially horizontal axis after 
the coating step to prevent the coating composition on a 

vertical surface of the work from running or sagging. 
The coating composition is arranged so that the coating 

composition has a flowability and at the same time the 
solvent accounts for not more than 30% by weight of the 

coating composition at a time during the setting step or 
the end of the same.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of coating a
work such as a vehicle body, an apparatus for carrying
out the method and
more particularly to a rotational coating method in which
a coating composition is applied to the surface of a work
to a thickness larger than a limit thickness of running
or sagging and the work is rotated about a substantially
horizontal axis in order to prevent running or sagging of
the coating composition, an apparatus for carrying out
the method.It has been known that when a work such as a
vehicle body is coated with a coating composition, the
smoothness of the coating film surface can be improved by
increasing the amount of coating composition to increase
the thickness of the coating film.That is, when a coating composition is applied to
the surface of a work, the surface of the coating film
tends to become smooth due to its surface tension which
acts on the surface of coating film as a tensile force in
a direction parallel to the surface of the coating film.
The smoothening effect by the surface tension becomes
better as the flowability of the coating composition 
increases. The flowability of the coating composition
increases with increase in the amount of coating
composition (the thickness of the coating film).
Accordingly, when the amount of the coating composition
is increased, the flowability of the coating composition
increases and the smoothness of the coating film becomes
better. Especially when the coating composition is
applied to a thickness larger than a limit thickness of
running or sagging, the surface of the coating film
becomes excellently smooth. The "limit thickness of
running or sagging" means a minimum thickness of the
coating film over which running or sagging of the coating
composition will occur and will be referred to simply as
"the running limit thickness", hereinbelow.When the coating composition is applied to a work
having a surface extending substantially in a vertical
direction to a thickness larger than the running limit
thickness, sagging or running of the coating composition
occurs in the vertical surface of the work under gravity,
which greatly deteriorates the smoothness of the coating
film.However when the work is rotated about a
horizontal axis after application of the coating
composition, a force in a direction opposite to the
gravity acts on the coating composition on the vertical
surface and sagging or running of the coating composition
can be prevented. Further a tensile force which acts on
the coating composition in a direction parallel

a coating step of applying a thermosetting coating composition having a
