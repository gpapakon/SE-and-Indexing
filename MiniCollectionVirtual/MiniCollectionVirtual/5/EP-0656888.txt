<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to retroviral protease
inhibitors and, more particularly, relates to novel compounds
and a composition and method for the use of such inhibitors
for preparing a medicament for inhibiting retroviral
proteases. This invention, in particular, relates to sulfonamide-containing
hydroxyethylamine protease inhibitor
compounds, a composition and the use thereof for preparing a
medicament for inhibiting retroviral proteases
such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease and
for treating a retroviral infection, e.g., an HIV
infection.During the replication cycle of retroviruses,
gag and gag-pol gene products are translated as proteins.
These proteins are subsequently processed by a virally
encoded protease (or proteinase) to yield viral enzymes
and structural proteins of the virus core. Most commonly,
the gag precursor proteins are processed into the core
proteins and the pol precursor proteins are processed into
the viral enzymes, e.g., reverse transcriptase and
retroviral protease. It has been shown that correct
processing of the precursor proteins by the retroviral
protease is necessary for assembly of infectious virons.
For example, it has been shown that frameshift mutations 
in the protease region of the pol gene of HIV prevents
processing of the gag precursor protein. It has also been
shown through site-directed mutagenesis of an aspartic
acid residue in the HIV protease that processing of the
gag precursor protein is prevented. Thus, attempts have
been made to inhibit viral replication by inhibiting the
action of retroviral proteases.Retroviral protease inhibition may involve a
transition-state mimetic whereby the retroviral protease
is exposed to a mimetic compound which binds to the enzyme
in competition with the gag and gag-pol proteins to
thereby inhibit replication of structural proteins and,
more importantly, the retroviral protease itself. In this
manner, retroviral replication proteases can be
effectively inhibited.Several classes of compounds have been proposed,
particularly for inhibition of proteases, such as for
inhibition of HIV protease. Such compounds include
hydroxyethylamine isosteres and reduced amide isosteres.

al, "Rational Design of Peptide-Based Proteinase
Inhibitors, "Science,248, 358 (1990); and Erickson et al,

Symmetric Inhibitor Complexed to HIV-1 Protease," Science,
