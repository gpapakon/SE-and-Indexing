<ABSTRACT>
The disclosed circuit breaker has two make and break control buttons. The make button (14) and the break button (13) are pivotingly mounted in the casing of the breaker and present, in front of view, a height difference (h) of their lower ends (20b, 20b'). Their upper ends (20a, 20a') clear and conceal alternately the display elements (32, 32') provided on the front face (17) of the casing.

<CLAIMS>
A circuit breaker comprising a box (10) 
containing a triggering and resetting mechanism 

susceptible of acting on separable contacts for opening 
and closing at least one electric current path, the box 

(10) comprising a front side (17) fitted with passage 
openings (15, 16) for an ON button (14) and an OFF 

button (13) accessible to an operator from outside of 
the box and cooperating with a mechanism control part 

(19) inside the box (10) so as to be capable of being 
displaced alternately and in a mutually reversed manner 

between two operational positions and having a pressing 
side (20) for the operator's finger,
 
characterized in that each of said buttons (13, 14): 


is pivotably mounted in the box (10) about an axis of 
rotation (X), by means of two curved arms (23) which 

extend near a first low displacement end (20a) of the 
pressing side (20), but opposite thereto and each 

comprise a face (23a) which slides respectively on a 
pivot gudgeon (21) coaxial to said axis (X), and 
comprises a control arm (27) which extends opposite a 
second high-displacement end (20b) of the pressing side 

(20) and is coupled with a control part (19) of said 
mechanism, 
 
so as to obtain, at least in the ON position, a 

difference in height h in front projection of the 
second end (20b) of the OFF button (13) in relation to 

that of the ON button (14). 
The circuit breaker as claimed in claim 1,
 
characterized by the fact that the first end (20a) of 

the pressing side (20) and the gudgeon (21) are 
arranged to enable said end to reveal and respectively 

hide a first visualizing means (32) associated with the 
front side (17) of the box (10) in both the operational 

positions of each button.  
 
The circuit breaker as claimed in claim 2,
 
characterized by the fact that the first visualizing 

means (32) is borne by an end of the surface of the 
gudgeon (21). 
The circuit breaker as claimed in claim 2,
 
characterized by the fact that the first end (20a) of 

the pressing side (20) of the button has a sloping edge 
(22). 
The circuit breaker as claimed in claim 1,
 
characterized by the fact that the button has, on at 

least one edge and on the reverse side of the pressing 
side (20), a stop surface (33, 34) that can be applied 

against the front side (17) of the box (10). 
The circuit breaker as claimed in claim 1,
 
characterized by the fact that said axis (X) is 

substantially situated at the level of a side (18a) of 
the box which is perpendicular to its front side (17). 
The circuit breaker as claimed in claim 1,
 
characterized by the fact that the shape of each button 

is such that it can be freely inserted from the front 
into the respective opening (15, 16) in the box (10), 

the button having a retaining catch (30) to prevent it 
from being extracted unexpectedly. 
The circuit breaker as claimed in claim 1,
 
characterized by the fact that the pivoting ON button 

has, near the second end (20b) of the pressing side 
(20), an orifice (31) of horizontal axis for a lock to 

pass. 
The circuit breaker as claimed in claim 8,
 
characterized by the fact that the orifice (31) for the 

lock to pass is situated in a broad part (51) of a pull  
 

(50) which is housed mobile in the ON button so as to 
take on an unobtrusive position and an outward locking 

position and which, in its outward position, can be 
applied against the front side (17) of the box. 
The circuit breaker as claimed in claim 1,
 
characterized by the fact that each button has a 

visualization window (26) and the box (10) comprises a 
second visualizing means (25) alternately visible 

through the windows of the buttons for the inward 
operational position of each one. 
The circuit breaker as claimed in claim 10,
 
characterized by the fact that the second visualizing 

means (25) is borne by a fixed element (39, 40) 
offering a guide surface to the button when pivoted.
