<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and apparatus for reducing steam pressure and temperature in a steam conditioning valve, in which steam flow is regulated with the aid of a valve plug (5) displaceably arranged in a valve seating (4), the plug being perforated by a plurality of holes (6), while cooling water is simultaneously taken into the upper portion (8) of the valve and is regulated in proportion to the regulation of process steam, said water being taken through a hollow valve spindle (7) passing through the plug (5) for discharge through a jet (12) downstream of the centre of the departing steam flow. The plug (5) has at least one row of holes (14) in its central region (13). For small opening amounts of the valve (1) process steam is taken through at least one separate duct (15) up to and past the coolant outlet from its openings (16) such as to flow past and break up the coolant, which is ejected from the duct (15) in the vicinity of, and just above the coolant outlet openings (16).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for 
reducing the pressure and temperature of steam in a steam 
conditioning valve, in which steam flow is regulated in a 
plug perforated by a plurality of holes, a greater or less 
number of holes being uncovered or closed off in response 
to the plug movement along a seating formed inside the 
valve, simultaneously as cooling water is taken into the 
upper part of the valve such as to be regulated with the 
aid of a water seat and a plurality of calibrated holes in 
a hollow valve spindle passing through the plug, and in 
proportion to regulation of the process steam, this cooling 
water then being taken through the hollow valve spindle for 
ejection via a jet downstream in relation to the centre of 
the departing steam flow. In previously known steam conditioning valves of a similar kind at present 
on the market and known from for example EP-A-0 134 454, steam conditioning is 
achieved by spraying finely divided water or condensate 
into the downstream or low pressure side of the valve. The 
coolant is taken into the valve via a so-called water 
collar in the upper part of the valve, adjacent a yoke for 
the valve operating means, and subsequently into a hollow 
valve spindle through a plurality of holes in the upper 
part thereof, this part regulating the water supply. The 
spindle constitutes an integrated part of the valve plug 
itself. An outside cooling water regulating valve compensates 
for pressure and temperature variations in the 
coolant and also for temperature variations in the super-heated 
steam. The coolant or condensate is sprayed in downstream of the 
valve main seating through the hollow valve spindle and 
into the centre of the steam flow, where the steam velocity 
is greatest, pressure low and turbulence very great. These  
 
factors contribute to an effective admixture of the coolant 
to the steam, resulting in rapid vapourisation. Downstream 
of the valve the steam velocity is reduced once again, and 
kinetic energy is converted to heat. This further contributes 
to rapid vapourisation of the coolant. The actual 
steam pressure regulation through the valve is performed 
with the aid of a plug, which is perforated by a large 
number of holes having different dimensions, thus achieving 
an optimum pressure regulation characteristic for the 
valve. The plug is guided by a seating, a greater or less 
number of these holes being uncovered or closed off to 
obtain regulation, depending on the position of the plug 
along the

Method of reducing the pressure and temperatures of 
steam in a steam conditioning valve (1), in which steam 

flow is regulated by a plug (5) perforated by a plurality 
of first holes (6), such that a greater or less number of holes 

(6) being uncovered or closed off in response to movement 
of the plug (5) along a seating (4) formed inside the valve 

(1), cooling water being simultaneously taken into the 
upper part (8) of the valve and regulated with the aid of a 

water seat (10) and a plurality of calibrated second holes (9) in 
a hollow valve spindle (7) passing through the plug (5), 

this regulation being proportional to that of the process 
steam, the cooling water then being taken through the 

hollow valve spindle (7) for spraying out and through a jet 
(12) in the centre of the departing steam flow, 


characterized
 in that for small opening 
amounts of the valve (1) process steam is taken directly 

to the vicinity of the outlet openings (16) of the jet (12) 
and the cooling water sprayed out therefrom, such as to 

break up this water by the process steam being caused to 
impinge on the sprayed-out water simultaneously as partial 

vapourisation of the water is achieved and process steam 
cooling is improved. 
Method as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized
 
in that process steam is taken into an annular 

space (15) surrounding the jet (12) and is caused to flow 
from the outlet (19) of this space (15), said outlet being 

situated immediately above the outlet openings (16) of the 
cooling water, which is ejected substantially transverse 

the axial direction of the hollow valve spindle (7), whereby 
the process steam with its entire unreduced pressure 

cuts across the direction of the cooling water flow such as 
to break up the water.  

 
Apparatus for reducing steam pressure and temperature 
in a steam conditioning valve (1), including a plug 

(5) coacting with a seating arranged in a valve housing 
(2), the plug being perforated by a plurality of first holes (6) 

for regulating steam flow through the valve (1), a hollow 
valve spindle (7) passing through the plug and having at 

its upper portion (8) a plurality of calibrated second holes (9) 
for coaction with a water seat (10) for feeding cooling 

water into the hollow spindle (7) in proportion to regulation 
of the steam, said cooling water flowing through a jet 

(12) extending downwardly below the plug (5) to exit at the 
centre of the departing steam flow, 
characterized
 
in that the plug (5) has in its central region 

(13) above the first holes (6) at least one row of third holes (14) 
adapted such that for small amounts of valve openings they 

lead process steam to at least one separate duct (15) 
taking the steam to the vicinity of outlet openings (16) 

for the cooling water in the jet (12). 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 3, 
characterized
 
in that the separate duct (15) is annular and 

delimited radially outwardly by a tubular jacket (17) 
concentric with the jet (12) and extending downwardly along 

the curved surface (18) of the jet such as to provide an 
annular outlet (19) above the outlet openings (16).
