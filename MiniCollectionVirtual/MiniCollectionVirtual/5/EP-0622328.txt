<ABSTRACT>
A vehicle jack comprising a standing leg (1) having a set-down foot (8), a supporting arm (3) pivotably attached to the standing leg (1) about a horizontal axis (2) and having at its free end a load head (4) which acts on the vehicle base and is pivotably adjustable by an adjusting member, in particular a threaded spindle (5), movably attached to it (4) and to the standing leg (1) directly or via further levers and articulations and to be actuated manually, and a support (15) connected to the standing leg (1) and resting on the base surface (11) in the setting position behind the set-down foot (8) on the side remote from the vehicle. In order to design this vehicle jack in such a way that no increase or only a slight increase in the weight of the jack results, the support (15), designed as a sheet-metal tab, is firmly connected to the standing leg (1).

<CLAIMS>
A vehicle jack comprising a support leg (1) having a base foot (8, 19) and a
U-shaped cross-section, a load-bearing arm (3) which is connected thereto

such as to pivot about a horizontal axle (2) and which load bearing arm
comprises at its free end a load-bearing head (4) which engages the base of

the motor vehicle and which load-bearing arm can be pivotably adjusted by
an adjusting member, in particular a threaded spindle (5) which is actuated

by hand and is movably connected to the said load-bearing arm and at the
support leg (1) directly or by way of further levers and articulations, and

comprising a sheet metal tab formed out of the base (13) of the support leg
(1) as a support (15), which when in position of application at the side remote

from the motor vehicle is supported on the ground (11) behind the base foot
(8, 19), characterised in that the sheet metal tab is stamped out on three

sides of the base (13) or out of the base (13)and the adjacent areas of the
side flange (14) and remains connected with one side adjacent to the base

foot (8, 19) with the support leg (1) and lies with its end remote from the base
foot (8, 19) flat on the ground (11).
A vehicle jack according to claim 1 or claim 2, characterised in that the
support (15) comprises a profiled cross-section.
