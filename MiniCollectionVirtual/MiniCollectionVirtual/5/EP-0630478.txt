<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus (20) for the collection of antigen, including an allergen, such as dust-mite allergen, dispersed in a motile fluid in a given environment can be inserted in one section of a pipe (21) of a standard vacuum cleaner hose. The apparatus (20) includes a receptacle (22), the body (25) of which is formed of a nylon mesh, typically with a pore size in the range 15-60  mu m, and which is coated with antibody which retains the antigen coming into contact therewith. The apparatus (20) is provided with a removable holder (26) which assists in locating the apparatus (20) in the pipe (21) of the vacuum cleaner. The apparatus (20) is directly usable in an immunoassay for confirming the presence of, or quantifying, the antigen.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus for the collection and 
detection of antigen and, in particular, to apparatus for collecting, 
detecting or determining an antigen dispersed in a motile fluid, 
including air, in a given environment, such as a household 
environment. The invention has particular application in the direct detection in 
the environment of antigens comprising, or derived from, a variety of 
substances, including micro-organisms, which are causative of disease, 
especially allergic diseases. In recent years it has become apparent that the common allergic 
diseases viz bronchial asthma, rhinitis and atopic dermatitis are 
inflammatory disorders. In particular, a number of recent studies have 
provided convincing evidence that immunological sensitivity to both 
dust-mite and cat-dander are highly significant independent risk factors 
associated with the development of asthma. Reports from many 
different countries have demonstrated a high prevalence of allergy to 
dust-mite among patients with asthma, ranging from 45-85% (Report 
of Intemational Workshop of the International Association of 
Allergology and Clinical Immunology, Bad Krenznach, FRG, 
September 1987, page 2, Bulletin of World Health Organisation August 
1988; and Platts-Mills, T.A.E. and Chapman, M.D. (1987) J. Allergy 
Clin. Immunol., 80, 6; 755-775). Mites representing a variety of species, but predominantly those 
of the species Dermatophagoides, are found wherever local 
environmental conditions, such as appropriate bedding, carpeting, soft  
 
furnishings, humidity and warmth, etc., favour their proliferation. A 
number of major allergen groups have been defined among the 
Dermatophagoides species and greater than 80% of mite allergic 
patients have IgE class antibodies to various allergens associated 
therewith. However, while the term "house dust-mite" applies to mites 
of the family Pyroglyphidae, of which ten species have been reported 
to occur in house dust more often than just occasionally, four species 
predominate in house dust namely: D. pteronyssinus, D. farinae, D. 
microcerus and Euroglyphus mayneii. Other mites found in houses can 
be important as causative factors of allergic disease and these include 
mites regarded as storage mites. Dispersed environmental allergens other than those from dust-mites 
are also relevant in allergic disease in some patients. Particularly 
important allergens include those from domestic pets such as cats (cat-dander, 
Fel dl), dogs and birds, cockroaches and other insects,
