<ABSTRACT>
A failsafe device is shown in which a solid state surge 
suppressor (12) is mounted thermally coupled to a heat transfer 

element (42). A shorting bar (60) is attached to element (42) by 
a thin layer of solder chosen to melt at a selected maximum 

temperature. A spring (70) places a preload on the shorting bar 
and, upon melting the solder, rapidly moves the shorting bar into 

engagement with leads (T, G, R) attached to the surge suppressor 
to short the T and R leads to ground (G).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to solid state electrical 
surge suppressors and more particularly to a device for providing 
failsafe protection for telecommunication equipment with which 
such suppressors are used. Solid state surge protection systems conventionally employ a 
surge protection device having a semiconducting element disposed 
between a pair of electrodes. This element is arranged in the 
circuit to selectively conduct electrical energy between the tip 
line and ground and/or the ring line and ground. For example, in 
the event a telecommunication circuit experiences an electrical 
surge as a result of lightning or A.C. line cross or the like in 
the circuit, the system is designed to shunt voltage from and 
thereby protect telecommunication equipment connected in the 
circuit from damage due to the surge condition. On occasion, 
the circuit may experience an even greater electrical surge which 
results in destruction of the semiconducting element so that the 
circuit components and telecommunication equipment would not 
thereafter be protected against electrical surge conditions. 
Accordingly, conventional surge protection systems typically 
incorporate means designed to move the electrodes into engagement 
with each other following destruction of the semiconducting 
element to thereby maintain a short circuit condition between the 
electrodes to protect the circuit and telecommunication equipment 
coupled to the circuit against subsequently occurring transient  
 
surge conditions until such time as the semiconducting 
element is replaced. An example of such a surge protection 
device is shown and described in US-A-5 327 318. According to applicable standards, a surge protector 
when mounted in a telecommunications line protector unit 
(TLPU) package must meet a number of test requirements 
including the ability to conduct defined tip to ground and 
ring to ground currents simultaneously and other defined 
currents, tip to ground or ring to ground, for specified 
durations without causing a safety hazard or propagating a 
fire. At the conclusion of the tests all TLPUs must either 
be shorted to ground or have a voltage limiting of less 
than a specified amount at a certain rate of rise. In US-A-3 947 730, which is considered to represent the closest prior art, a telephone line voltage surge 
protecting device is described in which a gas discharge 
element that becomes conducting when the line voltage 
exceeds a predetermined level is urged by a spring towards 
a conductive stop member

<CLAIMS>
A failsafe device comprising a telecommunications 
surge suppressor (12) having a ground lead (G) and at 

least one other lead (T.R), a housing (14,16) formed of 
electrically insulative material, the housing having a 

wall portion (18), a spring seat (26) formed in the wall 
portion, 


a thermally conductive member (42) in heat transfer 
relation with the surge suppressor (12), 
an electrically conductive shorting 
bar (60) having opposed first and second face surfaces, 

the first face surface facing the spring seat (26) and 
being soldered to the thermally conductive member (42), 

and 
a spring (70) received on the spring seat (26), the 
spring engaging the first face surface of the shorting bar 

(60) and placing a force on the shorting bar tending to 
move the shorting bar from a first position in which it is 

soldered to the thermally conductive member to a second 
position at which parts of the second face surface contact 

the leads of the surge suppressor, whereby excessive heat 
from the surge suppressor melts the solder attachment of 

the shorting bar to the thermally conductive member and 
allows the shorting bar to move to the second position. 
A failsafe device according to claim 1 in which 
the housing includes a first member (14) comprising the 

wall portion and further including a second member (16) 
comprising a central portion which is aligned with the 

leads, the leads being located intermediate the central 
portion and the shorting bar.

including a spring clip (74) to attach the first and second 

housing members to one another.

projections (82) formed on the first housing member, the 

spring clip being formed with apertures adapted to receive 
respective projections on the first housing member. 
A failsafe device according to any one of claims 1 
to 4 in which the thermally conductive member has an upper 

wall portion and a part (44) extending horizontally from 
the top of the upper wall portion to a free distal end and 

a lip (46) extending downwardly from the free distal end, 
the horizontal part and the lip extending over and down 

around the surge suppressor (12). 
A failsafe device according to claim 5 in which an 
aperture (20,24) is formed in the wall portion (18) of the 

housing and the thermally conductive member (42) has a tab 
(48,50) extending therefrom which is received in the 

aperture.

preceding claims in which the shorting bar (60) has pointed 

sections (66a,66b,66c) adapted to contact respective leads 
(G,T,R). 
A failsafe device according to any one of the 
preceding claims including a spring seat (64) formed on the 

shorting bar.  
 
A failsafe device according to any one of the 
preceding claims in which the solder of the attachment of 

the shorting bar to the thermally conductive member is 
selected to melt at approximately 138 Â°C. 
A failsafe device according to claim 9 in which the 
solder is composed, by weight, of approximately 58% 

bismuth and 42% tin. 
A failsafe device according to any one of the 
preceding claims in which the spring has approximately 

3.336 Newtons (0.75 pounds force) exerted on the shorting
