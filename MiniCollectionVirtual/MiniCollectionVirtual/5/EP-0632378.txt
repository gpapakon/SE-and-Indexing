<ABSTRACT>
A clock generator system for producing a number of 
multiple frequency digital clock signals for distribution to a 

number of synchronous, clocked devices, include two separate, 
substantially identically structured clock generator units 

that operate in lock-step unison. The digital clock signal 
outputs of one of the generator units is distributed to the 

synchronous, clocked devices and to a error detection circuit, 
that also receives the digital clock signals from other clock 

generator unite for comparison with one another. In the event 
an error is detected, the error detection circuit will produce 

an error signal to halt operation of the system with which the 
clock generator system is used, and reset the clock generator.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to digital
data processing systems, and more particularly to a clock
generator system that produces a number of clock signals, some
of a frequency different from the others.Data processing systems constructed today often use
a number of individual integrated circuit components mounted on
printed circuit boards and electrically interconnected to one
another. For synchronous operation of data processing systems
there is often also provided source of a digital clock signal
that is distributed to the integrated circuit devices mounted
on that board. For lower frequency clock signals (eg, clock
signals on the order of 1 Mhz and less), clock skew may not be
a significant problem. However, as systems are developed to
use clock frequencies that are much higher (e.g., greater than
1 Mhz) clock skew (i.e., the difference between the occurrence
of a transition of a clock signal as seen at points relative
to that occurrence at another point) can become a significant
problem.One solution is to handle information transfers
between integrated circuits asynchronously through
intermediate registers or the like. Another approach is to 
use phase locked loops (PLLS), but these devices often require a
reference signal in order to maintain a phase relation between
the reference and the output clock signals. At times, there is
jitter encountered between the clock signals of the comparison
that create a jitter in the output signals. In addition, PLLs
that are implemented in analog form tend to be susceptible to
power supply noise. In addition, analog PLLs require additional
components.DE-A-2532587 discloses a circuit arrangement for
monitoring the functionality of two clock generators to be used
in providing metering pulses for a telephone network. Metering
pulses produced by the two clock generators are compared by an
array of gates and in the event of a discrepancy between timings
of signals from the two clocks a reset pulse is sent to the
frequency dividers of the two clock generators to resynchronize
the two clocks.The present invention is defined in the appended claims.
It provides a clock generator system that includes a pair of
substantially identically structured clock generator units,
respectively termed "Master" and "Shadow". The clock generator
units operate in lock-step synchronism to each produce a
plurality of high frequency clock signals of at least two
(preferably three) different (but related) frequencies. Only the
clock signals produced by the master clock generator
