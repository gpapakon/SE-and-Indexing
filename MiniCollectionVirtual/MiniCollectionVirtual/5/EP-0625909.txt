<ABSTRACT>
Methods of assay for and therapeutic use of autoantibodies, specifically anti-thymocyte autoantibody (ATAA). This is a teaching of methods for the assay of autoantibodies and for ATAA use, based upon autoantibody quantity in relation to a target lymphocyte population, for predicting body resistivity/susceptibility to disease and tumors, as well as suggesting protocols for the treatment of various diseases, malignancies and autoimmune reactions. The main thrust of the disclosure is the inventor's thesis that, by altering the amount of autoantibodies (in sera) which regulates the target cell population, diseases and/or malignancies may be eliminated or otherwise controlled.

 AUTOANTIBODY ASSAY AND USAGE IN THE CONTROL OFHUMAN DISEASEBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the InventionThis invention relates generally to the field of biological cellular antigen assay and, specifically, to establishing a method of assay for autoantibodies in relation to regulation of the immune system. This includes, and herein teaches, a novel method for relating the assay to predict body resistivity (or susceptibility) to autoimmune diseases and tumors, thereafter suggesting a protocol for treatment of the aforesaid diseases by increase/reduction of the autoantibody titer.2. Discussion of Relevant PublicationsAll species tested (rat, mouse, man etc.) have a demonstrable antibody (ATAA) in their serum which is capable of reacting with and sometimes killing { in vi tro) a selected population of their own thymocytes (autologous) or thymocytes of the same species (allogeneic) . This antibody will also react in certain species with bromelain- treated red blood cells and possibly dendritic epithelial cells, CD5 receptor and a presently unknown receptor specific for ATAA. During the last decade or two, various investigators have detailed a wide variety of autoantibodies [specific antibodies which react with almost any tissue or organ in the body, i.e. brain, skin, various serum proteins (including antibody molecules), all blood 

cells (including lymphocytes), intestinal tissues, heart cells, etc.]. It has never been clear whether these antibodies cause resultant disease or are the result of the disease, but in some cases they are interpreted as being causal.One such autoantibody is one directed against antigens on thymocytes (ATAA) . There are many different types of thymocytes which originate in the thymus and are the precursors of T-lymphocytes which are found in blood and various lymphoid and non-lymphoid organs of the body. T- lymphocytes are concerned with cellular immunity, as differentiated from B-lymphocytes which produce antibodies and are responsible for the humoral immune response. The T-lymphocytes recognize antigens by recognition sites and accessory molecules which are of various types and which define each type of T-lymphocyte. The recognition sites are associated with the major histocompatibility complex. Thus, T-lymphocytes are of many different types, each identifiable by distinct antigenic differences and many of which have distinct functions. The development (ontogeny) of the various T-lymphocytes occur within the thymus gland and are present in various percentages, at

<CLAIMS>
WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. A method for evaluating the functional viability of an individual's immune system comprising: determining an amount of an autoantibody and its regulatory relationship to an amount of its target lymphocyte cell subpopulation; and comparing said amounts to a standard wherein said comparing correlates a high autoantibody amount with a high risk factor for autoimmune disease, vaccine reactions or hypersensitivity reactions and a low risk factor or vulnerability to malignancies, while a low autoantibody amount indicates the probability of high target cell subpopulation, high vulnerability to malignancy and a low cellular immunity.
2. A method for preventing tumor development and/or enhancing tumor rejection by a body comprising increasing autoantibody amount relative to a target cell subpopulation, the target cell being that associated with progression of said development and/or rejection, the increasing accomplished by any of the following:
(a) passively transferring serum from a donor with high levels of said autoantibody to a patient donee;
(b) producing and transferring to a donee monoclonal autoantibody; and
(c) using in the donee immuno stimulants. 


3. A method for preventing and/or treating autoimmune disease, vaccine reaction and hypersensitivity reaction comprising decreasing autoantibody amount relative to a target cell subpopulation in a patient/donee, said subpopulation being that of a cell causally related to said disease or said reactions, said autoantibody decreasing effected by one or more of the following:
(a) passing a patient's serum, i.e., extra- corporeal, over antigen containing immuno-absorbents;
(b) administering in vi vo a purified target cell antigen; and
(c) administering to said patient pharmacological agents which have a function of lowering existing antibody levels,
4. The method of Claim 2 wherein said autoantibody is an ATAA.
5. The method of Claim 3 wherein said autoantibody is an ATAA.
6. The method of Claim 2 wherein said increasing is accomplished by decreasing subpopulation of cells which are ATAA susceptible cells and said decreasing is accomplished by one or more of the following:
(a) increasing levels of ATAA;
(b) extra-corporeal passing of a patient's leukocytes over fixed monoclonal ATAA; 


 (c) using heterologous antibody by directing same at cellular antigens;
(d) using pharmacological or biological entities which are directed at biochemical or antigenic constituents of said susceptible cell; and
(e) treating a cell suspension in vi tro with ATAA thereby reducing the number of susceptible cells.
7. The method of Claim 3 wherein said decreasing is accomplished by increasing a subpopulation of cells which are ATAA susceptible cells and wherein said increasing of the susceptible cells is accomplished by one or more of the following:
(a) lowering levels of ATAA;
(b) adoptively transferring said susceptible cells from a fetal or adult source; and
(c) deleting, in vi tro, other lymphoid cell types thereby causing a functional increase in said susceptible cell subpopulation.
8. A quantitation method for determining the amount of anti T-cell autoantibody, ATAA, relative to a subpopulation of target T-cells in an individual's serum comprising:
(a) obtaining a quantum of target T-cell antigen from an ATAA-recognized antigen pool;
(b) mixing with said quantum of target T-cell antigen a predetermined quantity of the individual's serum; and 


 (c) determining by conventional quantification methods said amount of anti T-cell autoantibody and the number of target T-cells.
9. The method of Claim 8 further comprising predicting said individual's susceptibility/resistivity to disease or malignancy as such are related to amount of the target T- cells which may be helper, killer, suppressor or other cells involved with immunity in the individual.
