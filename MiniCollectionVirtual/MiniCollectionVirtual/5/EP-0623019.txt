<ABSTRACT>
Novel essential fatty acid based drugs comprising a substantial proportion of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the class of fatty acids esterified in position sn-2 of phosphatidylcholines (PCDHAs) acetylated in position sn-1, or lysophosphatidylcholines (lyso-PCDHAs), or DHA-triglycerides esterifed in position sn-2 and acetylated in positions sn-1 and sn-3. Said drugs are useful for treating cardiovascular diseases, including atheromatous disease, and essential fatty acid deficiency, particularly in the brain.

<CLAIMS>
Medicines based on essential fatty acids, characterized
in that they comprise, in a therapeutically effective

quantity, at least one compound chosen from the group
formed by :


DHA esterified in the sn-2 position, in the form of
lysophosphatidylcholine (lyso-PCDHA);
the DHA-phosphatidylcholines (PCDHAs) in which the
DHA is esterified in the sn-2 position and which has an

acyl group of very short length in the sn-1 position;
and the triglycerides in which the DHA is esterified
in the sn-2 position and which has acyl groups,

comprising from 2 to 6 carbon atoms, in the sn-1 and sn-3
positions.
Medicines according to Claim 1, characterized in that
the acyl group is an acetyl, propanoyl or butyryl group.
Medicines according to one of Claims 1 and 2,
characterized in that they comprise at least 70%

docosahexenoic acid (DHA) in the class of fatty acids
esterified in the sn-2 position
Medicines according to one of Claims 1 and 2,
characterized in that they comprise, as principal active

ingredient, at least 10% docosahexenoic acid (DHA) in the
class of fatty acids esterified in the sn-2 position of

the lysophosphatidylcholines. 
Use of the compounds defined in one of Claims 1 and 2
for the preparation of a medicine with an anti-aggregating

effect on platelets, particularly for the
preventative or curative treatment of cardio-vascular

diseases.
Use of the compounds defined in one of Claims 1 and 2,
for the preparation of a medicine for the treatment of

insufficiencies or a cerebral absence of essential fatty
acids.
Medicines according to any one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that it contains the quantity of active

ingredient required for a posology of from 1 to 100
mg/kg/day.
Medicines according to any one of Claims 1 to 4 and 7,
prepared for administration by the oral route.
Method of preparing a composition enriched in or
purified with respect to PCDHAs or lyso-PCDHA, in which

the phospholipids are extracted from a biomass by an
alcoholic solvent, the phosphatidylcholine containing the

DHA is isolated by high performance liquid chromatography
and the DHA is hydrolyzed by any lipase having A
1

phospholipase activity, the lyso-PCDHA obtained being
purified by chromatography.
Method according to Claim 9, characterized in that the
sn-1 position is acylated again by an acid chosen from the

group made up of acetic, propionic, butyric and caproic
acids. 
Method of preparing a composition enriched in or
purified with respect to PCDHAs, characterized in that a

diacylation is carried out on the glycerophosphocholine or
glycerophosphate using acetic, propionic, butyric or

caproic acid or their derivatives and then the sn-2
positions are selectively hydrolyzed by an A2

phospholipase, after which the Lyso-PC formed is again
acylated with a DHA derivative.
Method of preparing a composition enriched in or
purified with respect to PCDHAs, characterized in that a

diacylation is carried out on the glycerophosphocholine or
glycerophosphate using docosahexenoic acid (DHA) and then

the sn-1 positions are selectively hydrolyzed by an A1
phospholipase, after which the Lyso-PCDHA formed is again

acylated using acetic, propionic, butyric or caproic acid
or one of their derivatives.
