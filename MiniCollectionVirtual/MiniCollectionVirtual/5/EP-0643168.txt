<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for coating a paper web   having two rolls which are arranged parallel to each other and together form a roll nip for guiding the paper web through; having at least one application nozzle for applying a layer of coating colour to the outer surfaces of at least one of the rolls for the purpose of transferring the layer of coating colour in the roll nip from the outer surface onto one side of the paper web; having guide elements which are connected downstream of the roll nip and guide the dried paper web; the guide elements are air-support beams which produce an air-support cushion between the paper web and the surface, facing the paper web, of the air-support beam; the air-support beams are arranged in such a way that the paper web is deflected at least once after the roll nip.   The invention is characterised by the following features:   at least one air-support beam is connected immediately downstream of the roll nip; the air-support beam connected immediately downstream is arranged at a distance from the roll nip of the two rolls which is 0.3 to 1 times the roll diameter, preferably 0.5 to 0.8 times.

Device for coating a paper web

1.1. with two rollers (10, 20), which are disposed
parallel to one another, and which together form a

roller slot for passing through the paper web (10);
1.2 with at least one applicator nozzle (1.1, 5.1,
5.2, 8.1, 8.2, 10.1, 10.2) for applying a coating

pigment layer to the peripheral surfaces of at least
one of the rollers (10, 11) in order to transfer the

coating pigment layer in the roller slot from the
peripheral surface to one side of the paper web (11);
1.3. with guide members following the roller slot, and
which guide the paper web;
1.4 the guide members are air support beams (2, 3, 12,
14.1, 14.2, 14.3, 22, 23, 30, 31, 32, 40, 41, 42, 50,

60), which provide a cushion of supporting air between
the paper web (11) and the surface of the air support

beam facing the paper web;
1.5 the air support beams (2, 3, 12, 14.1, 14.2, 14.3,
22, 23, 30, 31, 32, 40, 41, 42, 50, 60) are so arranged 

that the paper web (11) is deflected at least once
after the roller slot;

characterised by the following features:
1.6 at least one air support beam (2, 3, 12, 14.1,
14.2, 14.3, 22, 23, 30, 31, 32, 40, 41, 42, 50, 60)

directly follows the roller slot;
1.7 the immediately subsequent air support beam (2, 3,
12, 14.1, 14.2, 14.3, 22, 23, 30, 31, 32, 40, 41, 50,

60) is disposed at a distance from the roller slot of
the two rollers (10, 20) which comes to 0.3 to 1 times

the roller diameter, preferably 0.5 to 0.8 times.
Device according to claim 1 characterised by the
following features:


2.1 immediately following the guide members is a
drying section which dries both sides of the paper web;
2.2 the drying section has a plurality of infrared
drying lengths (13, 15, 24, 26, 34, 36, 43) and

suspended drying lengths (13, 15, 24, 26, 34, 36, 43);
2.3 the infrared drying lengths (13, 15, 24, 26, 34,

36, 43) and the suspended drying lengths (14, 25, 35, 
37, 43, 44) are arranged alternately, seen in the

direction of transport of the web.
Device according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that the air outlet speed of the suspended drying

lengths (14, 25, 35, 37, 43, 44) comes to between 20
and 80 m/s.
Device according to one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that each infra-red drying length (14,

25, 35, 37, 43, 44), measured in the direction of
transport, has a length of 300 - 700 mm, and in that

each suspended drying length (14, 25, 35, 37, 43, 44),
seen in the direction of transport of the web, has a

length of 50 - 400 mm.
Device according to one of claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that at least two

air support beams (14.1, 14.2, 14.3, 22, 23, 40, 41,
50) are provided, and in that the paper web is

deflected through a corresponding arrangement of the
air support beams at least twice in a respectively

different direction of deflection (S-shaped
deflection).
Device according to one of claims 1 to 5,
characterised by such an arrangement of the first air 

support beam (12.1) following the roller slot, that the
paper web passes round one of the two rollers after the

roller slot.
Device according to one of claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that the looping angle is between 0

and 5Â°.
Device according to one of claims 1 to 7,
characterised in that a plurality of air support beams

(41, 42) is combined to form a bank of air support
beams.
