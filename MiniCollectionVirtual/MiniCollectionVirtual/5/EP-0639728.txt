<ABSTRACT>
Ring-shaped machine part, comprising at least two metallic machine elements (2, 3) which are separated from one another by a rubber layer (1) and have essentially mutually parallel surfaces (4, 5). At least one machine element (2, 3) is connected, outside the rubber layer (1), to a separately produced extension (6) which projects beyond the surface (4, 5) of said machine element.

An annular machine part, comprising at least two 
metallic machine elements (2, 3) separated from one another 

by a rubber layer (1) and having surfaces (4, 5) extending 
essentially parallel to one another, at least one of the 

machine elements (2, 3) being connected to a separately 
produced extension (6), characterized in that the extension 

(6) and/or at least one machine element (2, 3) are 
configured like a tyre and are produced from bar stock, and 

in that the bar stock configured like a tyre is bounded in 
the peripheral direction by ends (9, 10) which are secured 

to one another. 
A machine part according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the extension is of annular design. 
A machine part according to claim 2, characterized 
in that the extension (6) is concentric with at least one of 

the machine elements (2, 3). 
A machine part according to any one of claims 1 to 
3, characterized in that the extension (6) and the machine 

element (2, 3) are connected by a welding (7). 
A machine part according to claim 4, characterized 
in that the welding (7) is executed as spot welding. 
A machine part according to claim 4, characterized 
in that the welding (7) is executed as pulsed resistance 

welding. 
A machine part according to any one of claims 1 to 
6, characterized in that
 the ends (9,10) are secured to one 
another in a positive-locking manner. 
A machine part according to any one of claims 1 to 
6, characterized in that the ends (9, 10) are welded to one  

 
another. 
A method of making an annular machine part 
according to any one of claims 1 to 8, in which a rubber 

layer (1) is inserted in the intermediate space (11) between 
two metallic machine elements (2, 3) separated from one 

another and having surfaces (4, 5) extending essentially 
parallel to one another, at least one of the machine 

elements (2, 3) being connected to a separately produced 
extension (6) after the insertion of the rubber layer (1), 

characterized in that the extension (6) and/or at least one 
machine element (2, 3) is configured like a tyre and is 

produced from bar stock and in that the bar stock configured 
like a tyre is bounded in the peripheral direction by ends 

(9, 10) which are secured to one another. 
A method according to claim 9, characterized in 
that the machine element (2, 3) is calibrated before it is 

connected to the extension (6). 
A method according to either one of claims 9 to 10, 
characterized in that the machine element (2, 3) and/or the 

extension (6) are machined before they are connected to one 
another. 
A method according to either one of claims 10 to 
11, in which metallic materials are used for the production 

of the machine element (2, 3) and the extension (6), 
characterized in that the materials are connected to one 

another by a pulsed resistance welding process. 
A method according to any one of claims 9 to 12, 
characterized in that the machine element (2, 3) and the 

extension (6) are machined with regard to the surface 
quality before they are connected to one another.
