<ABSTRACT>
A highly pure, optically active 2-nitroimidazole derivative that can be used as a concomitant drug for the 
radiotherapy of various tumors because it has an excellent radiosensitizing effect and a high safety. It can be produced 

from an inexpensive diester of tartaric acid in a high yield according to reaction scheme (I), wherein R¹ and R², which 
may be the same or different from each other, represent each an aliphatic or aromatic group, and X represents halogen.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optically active
2-nitroimidazole derivative which is useful as a drug
used along with radiotherapy of cancers, a radiosensitizer
comprising the same as an effective component, a process
for preparing the same, and an intermediate for the
preparation of this derivative.A 2-nitroimidazole derivative represented by the
following formula (5) exhibits an action of promoting
radiosensitivity of hypoxic cells existing in cancers.
Because it has the excellent radiosensitivity and is
highly safe, this compound is known to be useful as a
drug used along with radiotherapy of cancer (Japanese
Patent Application Laid-open (kokai) No. 223258/1991).
A process of the following reaction scheme is known
for preparing the 2-nitroimidazole derivative (5). 
This process comprises a step of selectively
acylating three hydroxy groups, two primary hydroxy
groups and one secondary hydroxy group, among four
hydroxy groups in erythritol which is a raw material
compound. It is essential to react erythritol at a low
temperature in order to differentiate the reactivities of
the primary hydroxy group and the secondary hydroxy
group. But at such a low temperature, a large amount of
solvent is required, because this raw material is
scarcely soluble. Further, because the reaction product
from this step is a mixture containing tetra-, tri-, di- 
and mono-acylated compounds, and unreacted compound,
purification by column chromatography or the like is
indispensable in order to selectively obtain the target
triacylated compound. The low yield of this step results
in the decrease in the overall yield of the process. In
addition, expensive raw materials such as D-erythritol
and L-erythritol must be used in order to produce the
optically active 2-nitroimidazole derivative.The 2-nitroimidazole derivative (5) has two
asymmetric carbon atoms. Isolation of the optical
isomers is so difficult that there have been no reports
on the successful isolation of these isomers.
Furthermore, nothing have been known at all about the
pharmaceutical activities of these optical isomers.An object of the present invention is therefore to
provide optical isomers of 2-nitroimidazole derivative
(5) and a drug comprising the same as an effective
components.Other objects of the present invention is to provide
a novel process for the preparation of the 2-nitroimidazole
derivative (5) and an intermediate for
preparing this compound.In view of this situation, the present inventors
have undertaken extensive studies, and found that
