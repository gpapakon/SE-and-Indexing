<ABSTRACT>
The invention describes a display which comprises a film 
(2) mainly composed of silica which film absorbs a light 

having a wavelength of 250 nm more intensely than a light 
having a wavelength of 190 nm. It also describes a display, 

which comprises a film (2) mainly composed of silica which 
film does not substantially fluorescent when irradiated by 

argon gas laser at an output power of 100 mW. The display 
may be a cathode-ray tube or a liquid crystal display.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a display,
a cathode-ray tube and a liquid crystal display according
to the independent claims.In recent years, displays and in particular cathode-ray
tubes have been required to be of high performance
and good visibility. In order to meet the requirement, an
anti-reflection film is formed on the panel surface of a
cathode-ray tube, which film contributes to the improvement
of the visibility and to the protection of the panel surface
(JP-A-61-118946, JP-A-62-143348 and JP-A-63-76247).In the conventional method, an anti-reflection film
is formed by applying a solution containing Si(OR)4,
wherein R is lower alkyl, on the panel surface of a
cathode-ray tube by means of spray-coating or spin-coating 
and heating the solution-coated surface at a
temperature of 160°C, although the temperature is so
high that the cathode-ray tube is often damaged, to
decompose the coated solution to form a SiO2 film. This
SiO2 film imparts roughness on the panel surface of the
cathode-ray tube and serves as an anti-reflection film.It is also possible to form two or more films,
in place of a single film, on the panel surface of a
cathode-ray tube. In this case, the assembly of the
films having surface roughness is sometimes called
"anti-reflection film". The surface roughness of the
anti-reflection film allows an incoming light to give
rise to diffuse reflection and thereby makes better the
visibility of the image displayed on the cathode-ray
tube.There are some cathode-ray tubes having an
electrically conductive film under the anti-reflection
film to improve the performance through the prevention
of the electrification of the panel surface of the
cathode-ray tubes. The assembly of the anti-reflection
film and the electrically conductive film is sometimes
called "anti-reflection antistatic film".FR-A-2 629 268 discloses an antistatic film comprising a
transparent and electroconductive coating made of SiO2 and
fine particles which are selected from electroconductive
metal oxides and hygroscopic metal salts. This film coating
is formed by preparing a solution of ethanol, an alcoxy silane
and the above mentioned electroconductive particles,
applying this solution to a glass plate and heating the obtained
liquid coating to preferably 160 °C.Also, there
are some color cathode-ray tubes having either an anti-reflection
film containing an organic dye or an under
coat layer for anti-reflection film containing an
organic dye in order to make clearer the colors of their
images. The anti-reflection film
