<ABSTRACT>
It comprises an upper frame formed by two U-shaped 
members (1 and 1') hingedly attached to a block (3) to 

which there are also hingedly attached (4) the also U-shaped 
legs (5 and 5') supporting the mattress support 

substructure (17), said U-shaped members (1 and 1') of 
the frame, the legs (5, 5') and the stringers (18) of 

said substructure being hingedly divided. It is a feature 
that the hinged divisions (10) of the U-shaped members (1 

and 1') of the upper frame are two in number and are 
situated in end regions of the transverse portion (9, 9') 

of said members (1, 1'), so that when legs (5, 5') and 
the halves (1, 1') of the upper frame are folded 

together, the length equivalence of the arms (14) of the 
U-shaped members (1, 1') of the upper frame and of the 

upper portions (15) of the hingedly divided (11) legs (5, 
5'), allow said arms (14) and said portions (15) to be 

folded inwardly in approximately 90°.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a child's folding 
cot. Various models of folding cots are available on the 
market for people who have to travel with young children. 
Some are more complete than others and some are more 
complex than others, both in structure and in the folding 
means. Among the types of simple easily manageable folding 
cots there are those comprising an upper frame and a 
substructure for the mattress which are hingedly split 
crosswise in the middle. These cots also have telescopic 
legs for greater folding capacity. The same applicant is 
owner of EP-A-0 501 086 the object of which is a folding cot 
of this type and wherewith there is achieved a more 
compact and low volume folding of the cot, for which 
purpose the upper frame, the legs and the mattress 
substructure are provided with hingedly divided end 
portions to allow the cot to be folded down to 
approximately 1/3 of the volume achieved up to now. It is an object of the invention also to achieve a 
reduced volume in the folded state of the cot but 
providing the latter with a more simplified structure 
whereby its manufacture will be cheaper and in turn the 
cot folding operation will be easier. A further object of the invention is to achieve a 
better mattress support on the substructure to reduce the 
transverse flexing of the mattress in the cot. To simplify the folding, the telescopic U-shaped legs 
are being replaced by normal integral U-shaped legs and 
characteristically the hinged divisions in the end 
portions of the two U-shaped members forming the upper 
cot frame, which are two in number for each of these 
members, are situated at the end portions of the 
transverse portion thereof, so that when the legs and the  
 
halves of the upper frame are folded together, the length 
equivalence of the arms of said U-shaped elements and of 
the upper portions of the hingedly divided legs allow 
said arms and said portions to be folded inwardly by 
approximately 90° which places them one on top of the 
other. The improved mattress support is achieved with a 
substructure wherein the central portion of the stringers 
is provided with inwardly bent portions to bring the 
stringers closer together at said portions so as to 
reduce the sag or flexing of the mattress. It is also contemplated that the central portion of 
the support substructure stringers are straight, without 
said inwardly bent portions, mainly where a mattress must 
bear weight and pressure during the use of the cot which 
could even bent said central

<CLAIMS>
A child's folding cot, of the type comprising an 
upper frame formed by two U-shaped members (1 and 1') 

hingedly attached to a block (3) to which there are also 
hingedly attached (4) the also U-shaped legs (5 and 5') 

supporting the mattress support substructure 17, said U-shaped 
members (1 and 1') of the frame, the legs (5, 5') 

and the stringers (18) of said substructure being 
hingedly divided, characterized in that the hinged 

divisions (10) of the U-shaped members (1 and 1') of the 
upper frame are two in number and are situated in end 

regions of the transverse portion (9, 9') of said members 
(1, 1'), so that when the legs (5, 5') and the halves (1, 

1') of the upper frame are folded together, the length 
equivalence of the arms (14) of the U-shaped members (1, 

1') of the upper frame and of the upper portions (15) of 
the hingedly divided (11) 
legs (5, 5'), allow said arms 
(14) and said portions (15) to be folded inwardly in 

approximately 90° which places them one on top of the other. 
The child's folding cot of claim 1, characterized 
in that the stringers (18) of the mattress support 

substructure (17) have the central portion thereof (24) 
provided with inwardly directed portions shortening the 

distance between the stringers (18) in said portions (24) 
so as to reduce the transverse distance in the mattress 

support on said frame (17). 
The child's folding cot of claim 1, in which the 
stringers (18') of the mattress support substructure (17) 

are provided with straight central portion, which 
portions are hingedly connected at the end thereof by 

clamp (22) to the U-shaped end members (23) of said 
substructure (17).
