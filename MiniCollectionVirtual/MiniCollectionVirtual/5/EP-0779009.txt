<ABSTRACT>
Method and arrangements for transmitting and receiving menus, e.g. for accessing an electronic television programme guide. Each menu comprises a plurality of menu items which can be selected by a user. With each menu item, a subpicture can be associated. Said subpicture is displayed when the cursor touches said menu item on screen. Thus, by moving the cursor over the screen, the subpicture dynamically changes so as to display a brief explanation of the menu items.

<DESCRIPTION>
Transmission of menus to a receiver.The invention relates to a method of transmitting a menu to a receiver for display on said receiver, comprising the step of transmitting menu structure data defining displayable menu items which are selectable by a cursor. The invention also relates to a transmitter, television receiver and a display device for transmitting, receiving, and displaying, respectively, said menu.A known method and arrangement for transmitting menus to a television receiver as defined hereabove is disclosed in US Patent 4,992,871. The prior art method relates to teletext broadcast systems. The menus are transmitted as additional teletext pages, each comprising the menu items and the page numbers of the relevant teletext pages associated therewith. The user retrieves a particular page of interest by placing the cursor on the page number associated with a desired menu item and presses an OK key. If a plurality of menu pages is transmitted to form a tree structure, this step is repeated as many times as necessary. The transmission of electronic television video guides, whether or not in the form of teletext pages, is a feature of growing commercial importance. Some TV stations (e.g. Pro7 in Germany) transmit TV guide information related to a plurality of TV stations via teletext. Each teletext page comprises the programs scheduled for a day or a part thereof. Some TV stations also transmit a teletext page showing all programs currently being broadcast by a plurality of TV stations. Needless to say that a video guide transmission system must offer appropriate menus to assist the user in finding the desired information. An easy-to-use and attractive menu based access system is proposed in Applicant's co-pending patent application PHN 15.374 EPP, filed simultaneously with this application.It is an object of the invention to provide a method and arrangement for transmitting menus, wherein the menus have an attractive appearance and which yet better assist the user in retrieving the information of interest. 

 According to the invention, the method is characterized in that the method comprises the step of transmitting subpicture data defining displayable subpictures, and the step of associating with each menu item attribute data for linking a selected subpicture to said item so as to simultaneously display the menu and the subpicture which is associated with the menu item the display position of which corresponds with the display position of the cursor. Herewith is achieved that, while the cursor

Claims
1. A method of transmitting a menu to a receiver for display on said receiver, comprising the step of transmitting menu structure data defining displayable menu items which are selectable by a cursor, characterized in that the method comprises the step of transmitting subpicture data defining displayable subpictures, and the step of associating with each menu item attribute data for linking a selected subpicture to said item so as to simultaneously display the menu and the subpicture which is associated with the menu item the display position of which corresponds with the display position of the cursor.
2. A transmitter for transmitting a menu to a receiver for display on said receiver, comprising means for transmitting menu structure data defining displayable menu items which are selectable by a cursor, characterized in that the transmitter comprises means for transmitting subpicture data defining displayable subpictures, and means for associating with each menu item attribute data for linking a selected subpicture to said item so as to simultaneously display the menu and the subpicture which is associated with the menu item the display position of which corresponds with the display position of the cursor. 3. A display signal generator, comprising first memory means for storing menu structure data defining a menu having user-selectable menu items, second memory means for storing subpicture data defining displayable subpictures, and cursor means for generating a cursor, characterized in that attribute data is associated with each menu item for linking a selected subpicture to said item, the generator further being adapted to simultaneously display the menu and the stored subpicture which is associated with the menu item the display position of which corresponds with the display position of the cursor. 4. A television receiver, comprising a display signal generator according to claim 3, a display device, and further comprising means for receiving from a transmitter, and for storing in said memory means, said menu structure data and subpicture data.
5. A video recorder, comprising a display signal generator according to claim 3, and further comprising means for receiving from a transmitter, and for storing in said memory means, said menu structure data and subpicture data. 


6. A data signal comprising menu structure data defining displayable menu items which are selectable by a cursor, subpicture data defining displayable subpictures, wherein attribute data is associated with each menu item for linking a selected subpicture to said item.
7. A storage medium on which a data signal according to claim 6 has been stored.
