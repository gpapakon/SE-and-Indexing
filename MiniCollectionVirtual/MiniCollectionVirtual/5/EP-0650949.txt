<ABSTRACT>
2,2-diphenylhexafluoropropanes are prepared by 
condensation reaction of benzene or benzenes substituted with 

a halogen atom or atoms, a lower alkyl group or groups or a 
hydroxyl group or groups with hexafluoroacetone in the 

presence of trifluoromethane sulfonic acid. Among the 2,2-diphenylhexafluoropropanes, 
2,2-diphenylhexafluoropropane and 

2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)hexafluoropropane are novel compounds.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing
2,2-diphenylhexafluoropropanes, and more particularly to a
process for preparing 2, 2-diphenylhexafluoropropanes by
condensation reaction of benzene or monohalogenated benzene with
hexafluoroacetone.Heretofore, 2, 2-diphenylhexafluoropropanes as
intermediates for medicines, agricultural chemicals, etc., or
intermediates for synthetic rubber vulcanizing agents have
been prepared by condensation reaction of benzene or
substituted benzene with hexafluoroacetone in the presence of
hydrofluoric acid (US-A-3 310 573). However, the condensation reaction is
effective only for lower alkyl-substituted or hydroxyl-substituted
benzenes, and the reaction fails to proceed in
case of benzene or halogen-substituted benzenes. That is, two-stage
reaction has been required for the halogen-substituted
benzenes [Izv. Akad. Nauk. USSR Ser. Khim. No. 3, page 614
(1967); ibid. No.4, page 683 (1960)].An object of the present invention is to provide a
process for preparing 2,2-diphenylhexafluoropropanes
by condensation reaction of benzene or monohalogenated benzenes
with hexafluoroacetone.According to the present invention 2, 2-diphenylhexafluoropropanes 
are prepared by condensation reaction of benzene or
benzenes substituted with a halogen,
with
hexafluoroacetone in the presence of trifluoromethane sulfonic
acid.Benzene or substituted benzenes such as monofluorobenzene,
monochlorobenzene, monobromobenzene,
and hexafluoroacetone
are used usually in a molar ratio of the former to the latter
of 2 : 1. In the condensation reaction gaseous hexafluoroacetone
is used, and thus it is usually preferable to use a
pressure vessel such as an autoclave. The condensation
reaction can be also carried out by passing more than a
stoichiometrical amount of hexafluoroacetone through the
reaction solution while keeping the hexafluoroacetone in a
gaseous state. Reaction temperature is usually in a range of
0 to 300°C, preferably 0 to 200°C.According to an actual embodiment of condensation
reaction, benzene or monohalogenated benzenes and trifluoromethane
sulfonic acid are charged into a reactor vessel, and then
hexafluoroacetone is filled therein or passed therethrough,
where usually an excess amount of trifluoromethane sulfonic
acid is used so that 1.2 to 1.6 parts by mole of
trifluoromethane sulfonic acid can be present per part by mole
of hexafluoroacetone. Other perfluoroalkane sulfonic acids
than trifluoromethane sulfonic acid can be used.After the reaction, the desired product can be
