<ABSTRACT>
Systems fitted with a truck are widely used in order to study the risk of injuries in the case of a collision between a vehicle and an obstacle or in order to design appropriate protection measures. However, known equipment of this type do not provide the possibility to prevent by retraction the dynamic intrusion of parts of a vehicle, such as the inward deformation of the feet space in a motor vehicle, and thus do not offer the possibility to study the injuries made by intrusive vehicle parts, for example in the feet region. The present invention provides a system fitted with an intrusive truck (7) having an active device hinged thereon such as a foot rest (11) for preventing by retraction the inward deformation of the feet space in the area where they usually rest. Thanks to a drive system (2), the device is submitted to a jolting translation displacement as well as to a forced-coupling rotation movement corresponding to the relative displacement between the intrusive vehicle part and the motor vehicle which occurs upon a collision.

provided, fastened at one end to a positionally fixed

object (26) and rolled up at the other end on the shaft
of an eccentric cam plate (14) on which the active

device (11) rests (Fig. 6).
Combination of a device according to one of Claims
1 to 5 and a main slide of a main slide system

simulating a crash, 
characterized in that

main slide system simulating a crash. 
Combination according to Claim 8, 
characterized in
that
 the main slide system is designed as a hydropulse
slide system.
Combination according to Claim 9, 
characterized in
that
 a vertical lever (28) is coupled rotatably to the
slide construction of the hydropulse slide system, the

upper end of which lever can be brought into active
engagement with the intrusion slide (7) and the lower

end of which lever can be brought into active
engagement with a positionally fixed stop (29) (Fig.

7).
Combination according to one of Claims 8 to 10,
