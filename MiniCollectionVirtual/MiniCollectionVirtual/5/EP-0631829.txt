<ABSTRACT>
Hot forming of encapsulated metal parts (2) employs, according to the invention, a parting agent (release agent) in the form of a monolithic component (3a, 3b). This component consists of powder particles consolidated by sintering. The parting agent material is brittle at ambient temperature and is plastically deformable or able to flow with high viscosity at the forming temperature of the metal parts.

<CLAIMS>
A separating agent for the hot forming of encased metal 
parts (2), in the form of a monolithic component (3a, 3b; 

3), from powder particles of a material which are 
strengthened by sintering, which material is brittle at 

ambient temperature and which at the forming temperature 
of the metal parts is plastically deformable or is free-flowing 

in a highly viscous manner. 
A separating agent according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the monolithic component (3a, 3b; 
3) is layer- or shell-shaped, with the wall thickness 

being greater than approximately 0.3 mm. 
A separating agent according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that
 the material has a thermal 
conductivity which is less than approximately W/mÂ·K. 
A separating agent according to one of Clams 1 to 3,
characterised in that
 the material has a greater thermal 
expansion than the metal part (2) and the case material 

(10). 
A separating agent according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that
 the material substantially consists 
of calcium fluoride. 
A separating agent according to Claim 5,
characterised in that
 an impurity of the separating 
element with oxygen is less than approximately 1000 ppm 

by weight.  
 
A separating agent according to one of Claims 1 to 
6,
characterised in that
 the monolithic component (3a, 
3b) is a plate. 
A separating agent according to one of Claims 1 to 
7,
characterised in that
 the monolithic component (3) 
is tubular. 
A process for the manufacture of a separating agent 
according to one of Claims 1 to 8, whereby a slurry 

of the powder particles is brought into the form of 
a layer of roughly uniform thickness, this layer is 

dried on a support, from which it can be removed 
after drying, and the dried layer is hardened in a 

sintering furnace. 
A process according to Claim 9,
characterised in that
 before producing the layer, 
air bubbles, which are contained in the slurry, are 

removed in an evacuable container. 
A process according to Claim 9 or 10,
characterised in that
 the slurry is mixed with a 
binding agent, which during sintering can undergo 

pyrolysis without any residue or is inert with 
respect to the metal piece to be formed. 
A process according to one of Claims 9 to 11,
characterised in that
 the layer formed from the 
slurry is cast by means of a slip casting process.  

 
A process according to one of Claims 9 to 11,
characterised in that
 forming is performed by means 
of a slurry having a low liquid content and an 

extrusion process. 
A process according to one of Claims 9 to 13,
characterised in that
 calcium fluoride is used as 
the separating agent material,
in that
 the slurry is produced with water,
and in that
 the length of the sintering process step 
is chosen so that the oxygen content of the product 

is minimal or approximately minimal.
