<ABSTRACT>
A method for preparing a bismuth vanadate based pigment by (1) reacting an acidic bismuth nitrate solution with an alkaline ammonium metavanadate solution and optionally with other salts, to form a bismuth vanadate based precipitate in a highly acidic reaction medium with a pH of 1-2; (2) adding a base until the pH of the reaction medium is around 7; (3) raising the temperature to over 80  C in around 30 minutes while holding the pH at 7 by means of a base; (4) stirring for 30 minutes to over 2 hours until the pH is around 6.5; and (5) filtering, washing and drying the pigment. The resulting products and their use in dyeing paints, lacquers and/or plastics are also disclosed.

Process of producing a pigment based on 
bismuth vanadate characterized in that : 


1) an acid bismuth nitrate solution is reacted 
with a basic ammonium metavanadate solution and optionally 

other salts so as to form a precipitate based on bismuth 
vanadate in a very acid reaction medium at pH of about 1-2, 
2) pH of the reaction medium is brought to a 
value of about 7 with addition of a base, 
3) temperature is brought to a value of more than 
80°C within a period of about 30 minutes while maintaining 

pH at a value of 7 with a base, 
4) a stirring step is carried out for 1/2 hour to 
more than 2 hours up to a pH of about 6.5, and 
5) pigment is filtered, washed and dried. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in 
that a bismuth nitrate solution is reacted with a basic 

ammonium metavanadate solution by adding one solution to 
the other. 
Process according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that pH of the reaction medium of step (1) 

is directly brought to a fixed value of 7 by adding a base. 
Process according to any of preceding claims, 
characterized in that the resulting pigment is dried at a 

temperature higher or equal to 300°C. 
Process according to any of preceding claims, 
characterized in that the resulting pigment is coated  

 
and/or treated by adding inorganic and/or organic 

compounds. 
Pigment based on bismuth vanadate obtained by 
the process according to any of preceding claims. 
Use of the pigment based on bismuth vanadate 
according to claim 6 for colouring paints, lacquers and/or 

plastics.
