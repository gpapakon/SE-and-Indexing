<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a method for the continuous scanning and checking of tracks applied to a moving substrate. The applications can be one or more glue tracks on a box blank to be folded or the like. A light beam focussed at the object distance is directed onto the object via at least one periodic deflection device at right angles to the movement direction of the applied track. A receiver arrangement having its main incident radiation direction directed at an angle to the object surface and having a broadly conical aperture angle picks up the reflected radiation on both sides of the applied track optoelectronically, the received signals being compared with each other.

Method for continuous scanning and checking of track 
applications on a moving substrate or object of this type, for 

example of one or more tracks of glue on a foldable box blank, 

characterised in that
 a lightbeam focused on an object range 
is imaged to be oriented via at least one periodic deflecting 

device (2) perpendicularly to the object (13) and perpendicularly 
to the movement direction of the track application (7), and a 

receiver arrangement (3, 4) with broad conical opening angle, 
which is aligned with its main inward radiation direction at an 

angle to the object surface, opto-electronically receives with a 
temporal offset reflected radiation on both sides of a track 

application and compares the received signals. 
Method according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 scanning is 
substantially carried out free of inertia. 
Method according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 periodic 
deflection of the lightbeam is carried out at high frequency, and 

this is imaged in the form of a light line which is defined on both 
sides on the substrate. 
Method according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 an angle of 
virtually 90Â° is set between main entry direction of the receiver 

arrangement and focusing lightbeam of the light source. 
Method according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the light 
source is a laser light source. 
Method according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the 
distance between periodic deflecting device and object plane is 

chosen to be as great as possible. 
Device for carrying out the process according to at least one of 
Claims 1 to 6, comprising 


a light source (1) for generating a focused lightbeam,  
 
at least one deflecting device (2) in the beam path of the light 
source by means of which the lightbeam is periodically deflected 

in specified small angular ranges into a line form, 
a photo-electric receiver device (3, 4), which is arranged on both 
sides and at the top for track application (7), and 
an evaluation electronics (3', 4', 8, 9, 10) which compares 
reflected radiation of one side of a track application (7) with the 

reflected radiation of the other side of a track application (7) 
whilst taking into consideration the temporally offset scanning 

transversely to a track application (7). 
Device according to Claim 7, 
characterised in that
 the 
scanning device (2), which operates according to the scanning 

principle, is composed of at least one resonance frequency 
oscillator and/or polygon mirror. 
Device according to Claim 7, 
characterised in that
 the receiver 
arrangement (3, 4) is composed of two photo-electric sensors 

arranged on both sides of the track application(s). 
Device according to Claim 9, 
characterised in that
 the main 
inward radiation direction of the receiver arrangement (3, 4) is at 

least virtually parallel with the surface of the object (13). 
Device according to Claim 7, 
characterised in that
 the 
evaluation electronics comprises diametrally connected diodes 

(3', 4') which compensate signals of identical electrical strength 
from both sides of the track application (7). 
Device according to Claim 7, 
characterised in that
 a long path 
is provided between light source (1) and surface of the object 

(13) which carries the track (7).
