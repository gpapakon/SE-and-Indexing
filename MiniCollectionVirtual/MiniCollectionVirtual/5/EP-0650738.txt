<ABSTRACT>
A system for delivering sterile fluid to a patient, 
while preventing cross-contamination, in which flow interrupting 

means are provided which basically create regions where no fluid 
exists in the comprehensive or over-all quality of material that 

is flowing from a fluid source to a patient.

<DESCRIPTION>
In copending application EP 94 116 909.6 of
even date herewith and assigned to the same Assignee as the
present invention, discussion was undertaken with regard to the
problems arising from the potential cross-contamination that can
occur with a multi-patient fluid dispensing system. One facet
of the system provided involves prevention of contamination of
the multi-use segment of the fluid path during the time the
system is connected to the patient. The disclosed system
utilizes a back flow preventing valve and a
sterile filter.A back flow valve and a sterile filter combination
should give sufficient protection. Bacteria cannot penetrate
the filter. Viruses and proteins can penetrate the filter but
are not active, and so cannot swim upstream. They can only
diffuse. The drawbacks to this approach involve the pressure
drop through the filter and volume of fluid remaining in the
filter. Also, there is no way to verify that the filter is not
leaking.The present invention deals with additional methods of
preventing contamination of the reusable fluid path by the
patient being injected. To achieve the improved methods of
preventing contamination, the present invention embodies the 
concept of preventing back flow, by providing no open fluid path through which
bacteria can migrate or viruses or pyrogens can diffuse. (If a path is open, the
velocity can then be made sufficient to prevent back diffusion). Additionally,
turbulence must be avoided since turbulence necessarily involves reverse flows
and eddys that can carry material against the flow, unless the flow is high enough to
prevent any part of the fluid from having a net upstream velocity vector.Prior art document US 4,750,643 discloses a system for delivering sterile fluid to a
patient, comprising a source of sterile fluid, a fluid delivery system for directing the
sterile fluid from the source to a point of use in conjunction with a patient, wherein a
portion of said fluid delivery system including the portion in contact with the patient
is disposable and the reminder of the system is reusable, flow interrupting means in
each of the disposable portions of said fluid delivery system comprising physical
means that cause the flow to exist as discrete quantities and to be discontinuous so
that fluid free gaps exist in the delivery system to preclude cross-contamination and
per patient hook-ups forming the disposable portions of the fluid delivery system for
directing said sterile fluid into a plurality of patients. Further, spring clamps are
provided in the

<CLAIMS>
A system for delivering sterile fluid to a patient, comprising:

a) a source (10, 11) of sterile fluid
b) a fluid delivery system for directing the sterile fluid from the source (10,

11) to a point of use in conjunction with a patient, wherein a portion of
said fluid delivery system including the portion in contact with the patient

is disposable and the remainder of the system is reusable
c) flow interrupting means in each of the disposable portions of said fluid
delivery system comprising physical means that cause the flow to exist

as discrete quantities and to be discontinuous so that fluid free gaps exist
in the delivery system to preclude cross-contamination,
d) per patient hook-ups (30, 31, 32) forming the disposable portions of the
fluid delivery system for directing said sterile fluid into a plurality of patients

and
e) backflow prevention means arranged in each of said per patient hook-ups
(30, 31, 32) for allowing flow in a forward direction while preventing

flow in a backward direction.
A system as defined in claim 1, wherein said flow interrupting means comprises
a peristaltic flow mechanism (35).
A system as defined in claim 1 or 2, wherein said flow interrupting means
comprises a valve (66) having a fluid flow control means (65) that is positively

biased towards a flow interrupting position.
A system as defined in claim 3, wherein said biased fluid flow control means
(65) is shaped to create a laminar fluid flow in fluid passing therethrough.
A system for delivering sterile fluid to a patient, comprising:

a) a source (10, 11) of sterile fluid,
b) a fluid delivery system for directing the sterile fluid from the source (10,
11) to a point of use in conjunction with a patient, wherein a portion of

said fluid delivery system including the portion in contact with the patient
is disposable and the remainder of the system is reusable,
c) flow interrupting means in each of the disposable portions of said fluid
delivery system comprising a hydrophobic surface over which the fluid is

caused to flow and which prevents a string of fluid from remaining after
flow is stopped to preclude cross-contamination, wherein said flow interrupting

means is a collapsible bag (75) made from a hydrophobic material,
d) per patient hook-ups (30, 31, 32) forming the disposable portions of the
fluid delivery system for directing said sterile fluid into a plurality of patients

and
e) backflow prevention means arranged in each of said per patient hook-ups
(30, 31, 32) for allowing flow in a forward direction while preventing

flow in a backward direction.
A system as defined in any one of claims 1 - 5, wherein valve means (27) is
provided to selectively operate each of said per patient hook-ups (30, 31, 32).
A system as defined in claim 5 or 6, wherein said hydrophobic material is
polypropylene.
