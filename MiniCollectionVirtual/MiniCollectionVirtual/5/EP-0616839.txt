<ABSTRACT>
Process in which the solid components are each delivered to a gaseous carrier medium individually or combined in appropriate groups and the mass flows or volume flows of the components are then combined at high flow velocity in a mixing section in such a way that the mass flow or volume flow of the component or components having the quantitatively largest portion is first fanned out and directly afterwards the mass flows or volume flows of the remaining components to be mixed are fed into this fanned out mass flow or volume flow which is then reunited in an impact-like manner and led off for further use. The mixing device for carrying out this process has a pear shape, a central flow divider (2) for fanning out the quantitatively largest mass flow or volume flow, lateral inlet ports (10) for the remaining components to be mixed and an outlet port (7) for the finished mixture.
