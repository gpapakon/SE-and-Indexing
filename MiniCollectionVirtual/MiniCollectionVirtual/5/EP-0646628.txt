<ABSTRACT>
The present invention refers to a silver halide photographic element 
containing a support having coated thereon at least a silver halide emulsion layer 

spectrally sensitized with a sensitizing dye according to the formula (I): 


wherein Z represents the atoms necessary to complete a 6-membered 
nitrogen-containing heterocyclic nucleus; at least 2 members of R₁, R₂, R₃, R₄ and 

R₅ - but R₁ and R₂ not together - represent an organic group carrying a 
water-solubilizing group in free acid form, in salt form or in latent form, and are 

same or different, the members of R₁, R₂, R₃, R₄ and R₅ that do not represent a said 
organic radical carrying a water-solubilizing group represent hydrogen, an alkyl 

group, an alkenyl group or an aryl group; and n is 0 or 1. 
The silver halide photographic material has the advantage to have a broad 
sensitivity in the red portion of the spectrum. It can be exposed to laser beam 

sources in the range of 600-700 nm.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to spectrally sensitized silver halide photographic
elements having broad sensitivity in the red portion of the spectrum.Silver halide photography involves the exposure of silver halides with
radiation to form a latent image that is developed during photographic processing
to form a visible image. Silver halides are intrinsically sensitive only to light in the
blue and ultraviolet regions of the spectrum. Thus, when silver halides are to be
exposed to other wavelengths of radiation, such as green or red light in a multicolor
element, a spectral sensitizing dye is required.A Helium-neon laser is a typical light source emitting in the red portion of
the spectrum (632.8 nm). The advent of solid state diodes that emit red radiation,
having wavelengths in the range from 650 to 750 nm, has expanded the useful
applications of red-sensitive photographic elements. Because of the wide variety of
emission wavelengths, it would be desirable for a red-sensitive photographic
element to have broad sensitivity in the red portion of the spectrum. This would
allow a single element to be used with light sources, such as lasers and diodes,
having a variety of emission wavelengths. Such broad sensitivity can generally be
provided by either using a single sensitizing dye that provides broad sensitivity or
by a combination of sensitizing dyes (usually two) that, by themselves, would
provide narrower sensitivity. Many dye combinations have disadvantages, such as
poor sensitivity, e.g. due to desensitization, or poor keeping stability, e.g. formation
of fog during keeping.US Patent No. 5,116,722 discloses a method for forming a silver image by
exposing a silver halide emulsion spectrally sensitized with a trinuclear merocyanine
dye comprising at least 2 water-solubilizing groups to light of 600-690 nm,
said trinuclear merocyanine having a benzothiazole or benzoselenazole group. CH
Patent Application No. 677,409 describes merocyanine spectral sensitizing dyes
containing at least two acid groups for high contrast silver halide emulsions; a 
benzothiazole nucleus is preferably present in the structure of the spectral sensitizing
dyes.US Patent No. 4,717,650 describes a silver halide photographic emulsion
having a high spectral-sensitivity in a red-color wavelength range, especially within a
wavelength range of from 600 to 690 nm, by use of a benzimidazole pentacarbocyanine
spectral sensitizing dye.US Patent No. 4,336,323 describes a light insensitive imageable layer
comprising a synthetic polymeric
