<ABSTRACT>
A system for connecting together vertical elements (11) and 
horizontal elements (10) within a prefabricated structure, in 

which said elements (10, 11) comprise aligned holes through which 
reinforcement rods (15) embedded in a consolidation casting pass. 
Preferably, said holes are defined by sheaths (12, 13) 
incorporated into said elements (10, 11).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a system for connecting together 
vertical and horizontal elements within a prefabricated structure, 
characterised by dry mounting of its constituent elements. The general object of the present invention is to provide a system 
for connecting together vertical and horizontal elements by which 
a dry-mountable prefabricated structure can be obtained in which 
the horizontal structures consist of slabs interconnected to 
define a rigid platform, and the vertical structures consist of 
panels of load-bearing function extending in both directions and 
connected together vertically. The rigid platform is obtained by connecting the slabs together by 
the connection system according to the invention, achieved by 
positioning within the supporting and supported teeth of the 
adjacent slabs a preferably metal sheath of suitable diameter. It is hence possible to insert into the aligned sheaths a 
reinforcement rod or pin which following the subsequent injection 
of concrete forms a considerably effective edgewise connection 
providing continuity of the rigid platform. The same type of connection is also made between the slabs and  
 
vertical support panels, to make the platform monolithic in terms 
of distributing horizontal forces. In reality this connection not only joins the lower panels to the 
slabs but also creates reinforcement continuity between the lower 
panels and upper panels by means of a joint formed by injecting 
concrete into the sheath to set the reinforcements passing through 
the sheath. In the direction of greater inertia the panels hence function as a 
reinforced brace which discharges compression into the concrete 
and traction into the reinforcement rods, whereas in the direction 
of lesser inertia in constitutes in practice a hinge, ie it is 
unable to contribute to the strength of the other braces (panels 
positioned perpendicular to the preceding braces). In this manner a prefabricated structure can be formed in which 
the braced walls are always the perimetral walls and the walls of 
the stair-lift block, plus possibly other internal walls to reduce 
the floor span. A free plan is therefore obtainable in which the partitions are 
not load-bearing and can vary in position from floor to floor with 
time. A further characteristic of the connection system is that it is 
entirely of dry formation, ie the panels are mounted by resting 
each panel, in correspondence with the underlying reinforcements 
and sheaths, on a suitable pad of plastically deformable material
