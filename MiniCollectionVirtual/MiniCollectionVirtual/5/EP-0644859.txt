<ABSTRACT>
Process and plant for biological purification of polluted water wherein the polluted water is successively subjected to an anaerobic, anoxic and aerobic treatment in the presence of microorganisms, and wherein the anaerobic and the anoxic treatment are carried out in the presence of one or more microorganism cultures which are different from the microorganism culture used in the aerobic treatment. Hereby better exploitation of organic matter in the water is obtained thus improving the removal of nitrogen, and an increased reaction rate per unit mass of biomass is obtained thereby allowing the amount of biomass to be reduced or the total reaction rate of the plant to be increased.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a process for the biological purification 
of polluted water, such as waste water, wherein the polluted water 
is successively subjected to an anaerobic, an anoxic and an aerobic 
treatment in the presence of micro-organisms in order to reduce the 
nitrogen and phosphorus contents of the water. The ever increasing eutrophication of rivers, lakes and seas has 
resulted in more and more countries making requirements for the 
purification of waste water, in particular for the removal of 
nitrogen and phosphorus, and in the existing requirements becoming 
more and more strict. Various processes for the biological purification of waste water are 
known wherein at least a partial removal of nitrogen and phosphorus 
from the waste water is effected. Such known processes for the 
purification of waste water using bacteria are disclosed in i.a. DK 
patents Nos. 149,767 and 153,832. 
EP-A-0 247 212 discloses a plant and 
a process in which waste water is 
sujected to denitrification followed by nitrification under the 
use of separate microorganisms. In the known processes for the biological removal of nitrogen and 
phosphorus from waste water, the amount of easily decomposable 
organic matter contained in the waste water is often a limiting 
factor in the effectiveness of the processes, and where the waste 
water content of easily decomposable organic matter is insufficient, 
it is often necessary to add organic matter in order to obtain a 
desired degree of purification. The biological removal of phosphorus from the waste water is a 
result of the presence of phosphorus accumulating bacteria which, in 
anaerobic conditions, absorb easily decomposable organic matter from 
the untreated waste water which organic matter is stored in the form 
of e.g. polyhydroxy butyrate (PHB). The bacteria acquire the energy 
to perform such storing by decomposing polyphosphate from an intracellular 
storage. Hereby orthophosphate ions are produced which are 
released to the liquid phase. When the phosphorus accumulating bacteria are subsequently subjected 
to aerobic conditions the storage of organic matter is consumed as  
 
oxygen works as an oxidant. The bacteria use the energy thus produced 
partly for the absorption of orthophosphate ions from the 
liquid phase and for the accumulation thereof in the form of polyphosphate 
and partly for the basic metabolism and growth of the 
phosphorus accumulating bacteria. The removal of phosphorus from the waste water is subsequently 
achieved by removing the
