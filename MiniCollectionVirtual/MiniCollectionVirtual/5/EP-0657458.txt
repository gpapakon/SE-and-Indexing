<DESCRIPTION>
Protein kinase C (PKC) consists of a family of closely
related enzymes that function as serine/threonine kinases.
Protein kinase C plays an important role in cell-cell signaling,
gene expression, and in the control of cell differentiation and
growth. At present, there are currently at least ten known
isozymes of PKC that differ in their tissue distribution,
enzymatic specificity, and regulation. Nishizuka Y. Annu. Rev.
Biochem.58: 31-44 (1989); Nishizuka Y. Science258: 607-614
(1992).Protein kinase C isozymes are single polypeptide
chains ranging from 592 to 737 amino acids in length. The
isozymes contain a regulatory domain and a catalytic domain
connected by a linker peptide. The regulatory and catalytic
domains can be further subdivided into constant and variable
regions. The catalytic domain of protein kinase C is very
similar to that seen in other protein kinases while the
regulatory domain is unique to the PKC isozymes. The PKC
isozymes demonstrate between 40-80% homology at the amino acid
level among the group. However, the homology of a single
isozyme between different species is generally greater than 97%.Protein kinase C is a membrane-associated enzyme that
is allosterically regulated by a number of factors, including
membrane phospholipids, calcium, and certain membrane lipids
such as diacylglycerols that are liberated in response to the
activities of phospholipases. Bell, R.M. and Burns, D.J., J.
Biol. Chem.266: 4661-4664 (1991); Nishizuka, Y. Science258:
607-614 (1992). The protein kinase C isozymes, alpha, beta-1,
beta-2 and gamma, require membrane phospholipid, calcium and
diacylglycerol/phorbol esters for full activation. The delta,
epsilon, eta, and theta forms of PKC are calcium-independent in
their mode of activation. The zeta and lambda forms of PKC are
independent of both calcium and diacylglycerol and are believed
to require only membrane phospholipid for their activation.Only one or two of the protein kinase C isozymes may
be involved in a given disease state. For example, the elevated
blood glucose levels found in diabetes lead to an isozyme-specific 
elevation of the beta-2 isozyme in vascular tissues.
Inoguchi et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA89: 11059-11065
(1992). A diabetes-linked elevation of the beta isozyme in human
platelets has been correlated with their altered response to
agonists. Bastyr III, E.J. and Lu, J. Diabetes42: (Suppl. 1)
97A (1993). The human vitamin D receptor has been shown to be
selectively phosphorylated by protein kinase C beta. This
