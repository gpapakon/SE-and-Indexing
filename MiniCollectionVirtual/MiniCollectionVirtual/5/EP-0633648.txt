Permanent-magnet rotor for electric motors including 
at least two semitubular permanent magnets (10) which are 

at least partially embedded in a core made of two-component 
epoxy resin or plastics. The core is obtained in a mold 

(20) by molding in place or pouring over a pre-molded 
casing that contains the magnets, or by pouring so as to 

form, together with said core, a containment casing (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a permanent-magnet 
rotor for electric motors, and to a method of making a 
permanent-magnet rotor. As is known, electric motors with permanent-magnet 
rotors are currently used in the field of small centrifugal 
pumps. The magnets that are used are produced by sintering 
appropriate powders under the action of a magnetic field. For motors having rotors with an axial size of up to 
approximately 3 cm, the magnets are manufactured with a 
tubular shape by filling an appropriate mold with the 
powders and by applying axial compression. The compression is such that the axial dimension of the 
finished part is approximately one third of the dimension 
occupied by the powders when mold filling ends. For electric motors with a rotor having greater axial 
dimensions it becomes practically impossible to obtain the 
rotor with the above described method in an economically and 
qualitatively satisfactory manner, and therefore it is 
preferred to manufacture semitubular parts to be assembled 
so as to compose the tubular rotor. These semitubular parts are again obtained by sintering 
powders in a magnetic field, but in this case compression 
occurs at right angles to the axial direction. For rotor assembly, initially the two semitubular 
permanent magnets used to be enclosed in a tubular casing 
made of stainless steel which, being a diamagnetic material, 
in theory has no effect on the magnetic field produced by  
 
the stator of the motor. However, practical tests have shown that a dielectric 
current forms in the air gap between the magnets and the 
pole pieces due to the presence of the stainless steel 
casing and of the wall of the rotor chamber, causing a 30% 
drop in efficiency. An attempt was later made to embed the two semitubular 
permanent magnets in an injection-molded plastic casing, but 
even this attempt failed to yield the expected results due 
to the fact that the necessary minimum thicknesses of the 
plastic material and the significant axial size of the 
rotor, combined with the rather low fluidity of the 
injection-molded material, prevent the complete filling of 
the intended regions and thus give an unacceptable final 
result. Increase in injection pressures to achieve complete 
filling caused cracking of the magnets due to their great 
hardness and consequent great fragility. Also known from EP-A- 0218477 is a magnet rotor 
assembly as defined in the preamble of claim 1, which 
discloses a permanent-magnetic rotor for an a.c. synchronous 
electric motor,
