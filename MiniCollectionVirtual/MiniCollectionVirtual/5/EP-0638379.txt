<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a water based binder for use in a 
slurry for investment casting. The binder includes a mixture of 

a colloidal silica sol and at least one latex polymer. The latex 
polymer is preferably an acrylic latex or a styrene butadiene 

polymer (or a combination of these) which reduces the processing 
time between dips during shell mold making for investment 

casting. The latex polymer further lowers a critical 
concentration point or gelation point of the colloidal silica 

sol. The binder may be used as a primary binder or a backup 
binder in the shell mold making process. To make the slurry, the 

binder is combined with at least one refractory powder, 
preferably a refractory powder selected from the group of: 

alumino-silicates, fused silica, quartz silica, alumina, zircon, 
and zirconia.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the use of a water based binder system comprising colloidal silica and polymer(s)
to create a rapid-processing slurry system. This binder, when used to make a slurry, is capable of building a
ceramic shell in a very short time, for use in an investment casting process.The following documents relate to the technological background of this Invention:3,005,24410/1961Erdle, et al.3,126,5973/1964Operhall, et al.3,165,7991/1965Watts3,752,6898/1973Moore3,859,1531/1975Beyer, et al.3,894,5727/1975Moore3,933,1901/1976Fassler4,996,0842/1991Elkachouty5,118,7276/1992RobertsDE41 16 609 A1Germany7/1992The E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Co., Ludox® Colloidal Silica handbook on DuPont Ludox® colloidal silica
products.Encyclopedia of Chemistry, 4th edition, edited by Douglas Considine, Van Nostand Reinhold, NY, NY,
1984.The documents cited above are all entirely incorporated into this application by reference.The investment casting process (also known as the lostwax process) is thousands of years old. Until very
recently (circa 1950), flask molding was the predominant technique for making investment castings. Although
flask molding is still used for jewelry and dental castings, the technique of producing a shell-mold significantly
opened up the field for commercial and aerospace investment castings, because a much greater variety of
part configurations and sizes could be cast.Producing a shell-mold for investment casting usually includes dipping a wax replica (or model) into a slurry
containing a binder and a refractory powder. The slurry coats the wax, and excess slurry is allowed to drain
off. A coarser refractory is sprinkled onto the wet wax pattern, and this combination is allowed to dry. Additional
coatings of slurry and refractory are applied by the same method until the mold has sufficient thickness and
strength for further processing. The first coat applied is usually of a finer mesh size so that the mold will include
fine detail and a good surface finish. Backup coats are usually made of coarser powders. After it is thoroughly
dry, the shell-mold is then "dewaxed" to remove the original wax pattern. Then, the shell-mold is fired to remove
residual organics and to attain fired strength. Molten metal is then poured into the shell-mold. After the metal
is cooled, the shell is broken away and a metal casting has been produced.There are two main binder types used in shell making. The first is ethyl silicate, which is a solvent based
system usually employing ethanol, or a combination of ethanol
