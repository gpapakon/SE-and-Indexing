<ABSTRACT>
The device comprises a dual sensor unit (BC2), wherein the first sensor (1a) measures the distance from the unit to the metal surface of the pipe and the second sensor (3a) measures the distance up to the surface of the coating. The first sensor is an eddy current sensor and the second sensor (3a) is a laser diode sensor. The device further comprises a second sensor unit (BC1) identical to the first (BC2), which calibrates the eddy current sensor (1a) of the first unit (BC2) on the metal surface of the uncoated pipe. The two sensor units (BC1 and BC2) are connected to means (5, 6, 7) for processing the measurements supplied by the sensors.

Device for contactless measurement of the thickness of
internal linings, made of liquid materials capable of hardening,

of metal pipes and in particular of cast-iron pipes, of the type
including:


a measuring unit (BC2) formed of two sensors, a first
sensor (1a), of the Foucault current type, for measuring the

distance of the unit from the metal surface and a second sensor
(3a), of the laser diode type, for measuring the distance of the

unit from the surface of the lining,
means (5, 6, 7) for processing the output data from the
sensor unit in order to determine the thickness of the lining

from the data delivered by the two sensors (1a, 3a), and means
for calibrating the first sensor (1a), of the Foucault current

type, of the measuring sensor unit (BC2), characterised in that
the calibrating means comprise a sensor unit (BC1) for

calibrating the sensor (1a), of the Foucault current type, of the
measuring sensor unit (BC2), the said calibrating unit likewise

being connected to the data-processing means (5, 6, 7).
Device according to Claim 1, characterised in that the
calibrating sensor unit (BC1) includes a first sensor (1), of the

Foucault current type, intended to deliver voltages corresponding
to distances of the unit from the metal surface (F) of a pipe,

which sensor is identical to the first sensor (1a) of the
measuring unit (BC2), and a second sensor (3), of the laser diode

type, for measuring the distance of the unit from the free
surface of the said pipe when unlined.
Device according to either one of Claims 1 and 2,
characterised in that the calibrating means comprise the

measuring unit (BC2) used alternately as a calibrating unit and
as a measuring unit.
Device according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the processing means are an analog/digital

acquisition card (5), a computer, or a processing unit (6) and
its keyboard (7).
Method for contactless measurement of the thickness of 
internal linings, made of liquid materials capable of hardening,

of metal pipes, in particular of cast-iron pipes, with the aid
of the device according to any one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that:

a measuring sensor unit (BC2) is introduced into a lined
pipe, the distance (D2) from the metal surface is measured with

the aid of the first sensor (1a) and the distance (D1) from the
free surface of the lining is measured with the aid of the second

sensor (3a) of the unit, and the thickness (e) of the lining is
calculated from the difference between the two aforementioned

distances,
the first sensor (1a), being a sensor of the Foucault
current type, further includes a phase for calibrating this

sensor, in the course of which a sensor unit (BC1; BC2) is
introduced into the unlined pipe, the sensor unit is displaced

transversely to the axis of the pipe, for each displacement of
the sensor unit the distance thereof from the metal surface of

the pipe is measured with the aid of the sensor (3; 3a) of the
laser diode type and the corresponding voltage response of the

sensor (1; 1a) of the Foucault current type is measured, the data
obtained is transmitted to the processing means (5, 6) in order

to obtain the function distance = f(voltage) of the sensor (la)
of the Foucault current type, and the sensor unit (BC1; BC2) is

withdrawn in order to allow a lining to be put on the internal
surface of the pipe.
Method according to Claim 5, characterised in that the
function distance f=(voltage) is obtained by the means for

processing the data measured during the calibrating phase by
means of an approximation of this function to a polynomial of the

4th degree by the method of the least error squares.
Method according to Claim 5, characterised in that the
sensor unit used in the course of the calibrating phase is the

measuring sensor unit (BC2).
Method according to Claim 5, characterised in that the
sensor unit used in the course of the calibrating phase is the

calibrating sensor unit (BC1).
