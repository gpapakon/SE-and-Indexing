<ABSTRACT>
A plug-in connection (1) for pipes, sleeves, in particular (hard) hoses or similar round bodies has, in a receiving sleeve (3), one or more sealing rings (4) which, in the use position, rest, under compression, on the outer side of the pipe (2). In order to fix the pipe (2) axially, use is made of any clamping, bracing or other retaining device, e.g. a retaining disc (5) which is slit in its inner region, which is axially adjacent to the sealing ring or rings (4), projects into the interior cross-section of the receiving sleeve (3) and is oriented in a sloping manner from the outside to the inside in the plug-in direction such that a pipe (2) which is plugged in through said retaining disc (5), with elastic deformation of the inner region of the retaining disc (5), is fixed in an axial direction against pulling back. Sealing ring (4) and retaining device (5) are arranged such that they are adjacent to one another, it being possible to provide yet another compression ring (6) between the sealing ring and the retaining device. The parts serving in the receiving sleeve (3) to secure and seal the pipe (2) are fixed by means of a screw-connection ring (7), with the result that simple assembly is achieved. This screw-connection ring (7) can then be screwed in the axial direction further into the receiving sleeve (3), from the conventional assembly position in which the sealing action of the sealing ring (4) has already taken effect by simply plugging in the pipe (2), as a result of which the sealing ring (4) is placed axially under pressure and deformed such that, in the radial direction, it is pressed more strongly onto the outer side of the pipe. Consequently, the sealing action is improved and is also kept effective for a longer service life, this being expedient, in particular, in the case of inaccessible mounting, for example under plaster. Furthermore, for example two sealing rings may also be provided one behind the other in order further to increase the sealing action, in particular by the abovementioned pressing.
