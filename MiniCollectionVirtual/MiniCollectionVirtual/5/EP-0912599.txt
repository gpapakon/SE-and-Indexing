<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns an organometallic complex obtainable by reacting: a metal cation (M) having an oxidation number of at least 2 capable of being used in the living metabolism; sitosterol, sitostanol or a mixture of sitosterol and sitostanol; diglycerid of formula (I), in which: R1 is an oleic acid radical (C18:1); R2 is a fatty acid radical containing 2 to 18 carbon atoms, linear or branched, saturated or unsaturate. The invention also concerns in particular complexes in which R2 is an oleolyl or acetyl grouping. It also concerns pharmaceutical compositions and dietetic products containing this complex, particularly those in which the metal is vanadium, and their use in the treatment and/or the prevention of hypercholesterolemy and hypertriglyceridemy, of insulin-dependent or non insulin-dependent diabetes, of insulin-resistance and associated pathologies, in particular cardiovascular-vascular.
