<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing rigid polyurethane foam by using 1,1-dichloro-1-fluoroethane (HCFC-141b) as the blowing agent 
while substantially preventing the generation of decomposition products of HCFC-141b. The process comprises foaming a mixture 

of a polyol with an organic polyisocyanate in the presence of HCFC-141b and a stabilizer thereof by using an organometallic 
catalyst or/and an imidazole catalyst.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of producing
rigid polyurethane foams which comprises using, as the
blowing agent, 1,1-dichloro-1-fluoroethane (hereinafter
referred to as HCFC-141b) containing a stabilizer and, as
the catalyst, an organic metal catalyst and/or an
imidazole compound catalyst to thereby control the
decomposition of HCFC-141b, and to the thus-obtained rigid
polyurethane foams substantially free of HCFC-141b-derived
decomposition products.Rigid polyurethane foams are good insulating
materials and are excellent in moldability and processability.
Therefore, they are widely used in various
fields, for example as insulating materials for
refrigerators, buildings, low-temperature warehouses,
storage tanks, refrigerator ships, pipes and so forth.
They have been improved in thermal conductivity year by
year. At present, they can have a thermal conductivity as
low as about 0.015 W/mK on the commercial product level
and thus show the best insulator performance among heat 
insulating materials used at around normal temperature.
However, the requirement that the insulating materials
should have a still lower thermal conductivity is
increasing with the recent request for much more energy
saving.In producing rigid polyurethane foams, the so-called
one-shot process is generally used which comprises
mixing a composition (A) comprising, as main components
thereof, a polyol, a catalyst, a foam controlling agent
(cell stabilizer) and a blowing agent with a composition
(B) comprising, as a main component thereof, an organic
polyisocyanate and thus causing the foaming process and
curing process to proceed in parallel for foam formation.A typical example of the blowing agent used in
such rigid polyurethane foam production is trichlorofluoromethane
(R-11). R-11 is often used in combination
with water, which is a chemical blowing agent capable of
reacting with isocyanates to generate carbon dioxide.
However, the conventional chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) blowing
agents, typically R-11, are chemically stable and
therefore, as heretofore pointed out, can diffuse far into
the stratosphere and destroy the ozone layer. The result
would be that ultraviolet radiation from the sun be not
absorbed in the ozone layer but reach the surface of the
earth, causing skin cancer and so on. Such is now a 
serious global-scale environmental problem. Therefore,
the use of CFCs has been restricted since 1989. Of
course, the use of R-11 in urethane foam production is now
under control.Accordingly, various investigations have been
made
