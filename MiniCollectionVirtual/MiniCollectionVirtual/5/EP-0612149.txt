<ABSTRACT>
A method for adjusting an adaptive exponential filter, especially for 
noise reduction, the input of which is supplied with a series of time-discrete 

input signals containing both data and noise, wherein an 
estimate of the standard deviation of the filter input signal has been 

determined prior to the execution of the adaptive exponential filter 
method, comprises the steps of measuring the deviation between the 

current filter input signal to the adaptive exponential filter and 
the prior sample period's output signal from the exponential filter, 

determining the proportion of said deviation to said estimate of the 
standard deviation, and adjusting the discrete time constant of the 

filter in response to said proportion to provide a filter output signal 
at the output of the adaptive exponential filter. Further a corresponding 

adaptive exponential filter is described.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for adjusting an adaptive exponential
filter and an adaptive exponential filter. The invention is useful in
the reduction of the noise component in a signal representing the value
of the measurement. The input of the filter is supplied with a series
of time-discrete input signals containing both a data component (or
the value representing the measurement) and a noise component (or a
distortion of the value representing the measurement). Within a process
control context, the invention further relates to the use of the adaptive
exponential filter in a control loop, a control loop, and a method
for controlling a control loop.Adaptive filters are filters that have the ability to adjust their own
parameters automatically. They can be used to diminish the adverse
effects of noise distortion in processing signals in a number of applications
such as noise cancellation or noise reduction, echo canceller,
leakage compensation, line equalization, speech processing, or the
like. In this connection the term "noise" is used to signify all forms
of interference.In the case of process control, noise signals can either be produced
in the process system (to which measurements are applied) as process
noise or in the measurement system as measurement noise. It is usually
not possible to identify the source of noise in a signal through the
use of conventional analytical techniques on the time discrete signals
themselves. Usually, noise will demonstrate an oscillatory or vibrational
characteristic when a series of discrete signals is analyzed as
a function of time; usually, the overall oscillatory pattern can be
resolved into a set of sine waves having characteristic frequencies. Process noise is produced from transient variations in the process system
itself in the regions proximate to the location of the measuring
sensor. There are a variety of factors that can contribute to such
variations in the process system itself such as the presence of entrained
gas bubbles in a liquid, local variations in a liquid density
as in the case of agitated oil/water mixtures, local variations in
liquid temperature, turbulence, or the like.Measurement noise is produced in each stage of the measurement system.
The measurement noise is usually a function of the quality of the
measurement system.Current methods used to measure process variables such as temperature,
pressure, and flow inherently yield signals which incorporate both process
noise and measurement noise in their magnitude. Hence, using a
process
