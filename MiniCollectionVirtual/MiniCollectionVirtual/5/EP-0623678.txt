<ABSTRACT>
A norbornane type ester hydrolase that 
enantio-selectively hydrolyzes a (±)-exo-norbornane 

type ester represented by Formula I is provided: 

   wherein R is acyl, and A and B are hydrogens, 
respectively, or where A and B are absent, resulting in 

a carbon-carbon double bond between the carbons to 
which A and B are attached in Formula I. The norbornane 

type ester hydrolase has an optimal pH of approximately 
8 and a stable pH range of approximately 6 to 8.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel
norbornane type ester hydrolase that enantio-selectively
hydrolyzes a (±)-exo-norbornane type ester to
produce optically active norborneol; a structural gene
of the norbornane type ester hydrolase; an expression
vector including the structural gene; a transformant
including the expression vector; and a production
method for the norbornane type ester hydrolase using
the transformant.Several methods for preparing norborneol are
known in the art. The known methods are classified
into chemical and biological methods. For example, the
following chemical method is known. Norbornene used as
a starting material is allowed to react with an organic
acid to produce a norbornane type ester compound. The
ester compound is chemically hydrolyzed to produce
norborneol. In this chemical method, four kinds of
stereoisomers of norborneol (i.e., (+)-endo-norborneol,
(-)-endo-norborneol, (+)-exo-norborneol and (-)-exonorborneol)
are simultaneously produced. Therefore, a
complicated separation is further required to obtain an
optically active norborneol.Another production method for norborneol
using the following biological method is also known.
Norbornene used as a starting material is allowed to
react with an organic acid to produce a norbornane type
ester compound. The ester compound is allowed to react 
with an enzyme, or to come in contact with microorganisms
producing such an enzyme, thereby hydrolyzing the
ester compound to obtain norborneol. With regard to
this biological method, Oberhauser et al. reported a
method for producing (-)-norborneol from (±)-norbornyl
acetate by using a lipase derived from Candidacylindraceae
(Th. Oberhauser et al., Tetrahedron, 43,
3931-3941, 1987). The method using the lipase, however,
has a low selectivity and the produced norborneol
has a low optical purity.Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication
No. 2-273196 discloses an optical resolution method of
a racemic mixture using a biological hydrolysis reaction,
in which an inhibitor for selectively inhibiting
the hydrolysis reaction of one of the enantiomers is
used in the reaction. Such a method can be employed to
prepare optically active norborneol. In this method,
however, it is necessary to perform a screening of
inhibitors to obtain an inhibitor that is useful in the
selection of the optically active norborneol. Further,
it is required to remove the inhibitor after the reaction.
As a result, such a method is disadvantageously
complicated.The norbornane type ester hydrolase of this
invention
