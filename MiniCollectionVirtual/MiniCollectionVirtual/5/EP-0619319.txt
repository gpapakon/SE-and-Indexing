<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel 
derivatives of an antibiotic erythromycin. More 
particularly, it relates to novel derivatives of 5-O-desosaminylerythronolide 
derivatives and pharmaceutically 
acceptable acid addition salts thereof. Erythromycin is an antibiotic clinically 
widely used as an agent for curing infectious diseases 
caused by Gram-positive bacteria, some Gram-negative 
bacteria, mycoplasmas, etc. Many derivatives of 
erythromycin have been produced for improving the 
biological and/or pharmacodynamic characteristics of 
erythromycin. As 5-O-desosaminylerythronolide 
derivatives, 3-O-acyl-5-O-desosaminylerythronolide 
derivatives, for example, have been disclosed in U.S. 
Patent 3,923,784. 5-O-desosaminylerythronolide 
derivatives, however, have been generally considered to 
be poor in antibacterial activity, and the antibacterial 
activity of the above-exemplified derivatives is also 
very weak. EP-A-0 487 411 discloses several erythromycin 
derivatives, a process for their preparation and their 
application as a medicament. An object of the present 
invention is to provide novel antibiotics having a strong 
antibacterial activity.  
 The present inventors conducted various 
research on the antibacterial activity of 5-O-desosaminylerythronolide 
derivatives and consequently 
found that compounds obtained by introducing a carbamoyl 
group into 5-O-desosaminylerythronolide derivatives at 
the 3-position have an unexpectedly strong antibacterial 
activity, whereby the present invention has been 
accomplished. The present invention is 5-O-desosaminylerythronolide 
derivatives represented by the formula: 
 
[wherein each of R1 and R2 is a hydrogen atom; a 
phenyl group; a substituted phenyl group having 1 to 5 
substituents selected from halogen atoms, nitro groups 
and amino groups; a C1-C15 alkyl group; a C2-C15 alkyl 
group containing at least one nitrogen atom, oxygen 
atom or sulfur atom; a C7-C15 aralkyl group; or a 
C7-C15 aralkyl group containing at least one nitrogen 
atom, oxygen atom or sulfur atom; R1 and R2 being  
 
able to form a ring together with the 
adjacent nitrogen atom, Z is an oxygen atom or a group 
represented by the formula =N-O-R3 (wherein R3 is a 
hydrogen atom; a C1-C8 alkyl group; a C2-C18 alkyl group 
containing at least one nitrogen atom, oxygen atom or 
sulfur atom; a benzyl group; or a substituted benzyl
