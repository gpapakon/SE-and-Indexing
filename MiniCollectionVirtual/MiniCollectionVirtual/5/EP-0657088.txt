<ABSTRACT>
A microwave melting and refining oven for treating products in solution or solid products comprises a waveguide (11) carrying a microwave radiation beam (14) generated by a generator (15) coupled to a first end of the guide (11). At its top, close to its first end and opposite the bottom wall inclined downwards, the waveguide (11) has an opening (17) for receiving materials (18), and in its bottom part close to its second end it has a variable height overflow gate (20) defining a retention volume (21) for the materials which have been gradually melted in a continuous flow (16) along the bottom wall of the guide, from the point at which they enter this guide. Application particularly to industrial or nuclear waste processing.
