<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor memory device and an initialization method therefor, 
wherein writing of the initialization data into memory cells of the 

semiconductor memory device can be performed in a simple way in a short 
period of time. When initialization is performed, a high (H) level 

initialization mode signal DFT is generated from initialization control unit 
24. A sense amplifier driving circuit 20 sets a sense amplifier driving signal 

PC, NC to the high-impedance state, equalization control signal generating 
unit 22 maintains the equalization control signal E on the H-level, and bit 

line driving circuit 26 sets precharge feed line BLR on Vcc (H-level) or Vss 
low (L) level). In this way, in the memory cell array, the operation of sense 

amplifier SAi of each row stops, and transistors TR3, TR4, TR5 of precharge 
circuit PRi are ON, while voltage Vcc or Vss or precharge feed line BLR is fed 

to two bit lines BLi, BLi- through transistors TR1, TR2. In this state, the 
word line WLj of the assigned column is activated.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a semiconductor memory device
as defined in the precharacterizing portion of claim 1 and
a method of initializing a semiconductor memory device as defined
in the precharacterizing portion of claim 4.In the device test of a semiconductor memory device, the various
memory cells must have the prescribed value as their stored information.
However, when the power source is turned on, the value becomes
undetermined for each memory cell. Consequently, before performing the
test, it is necessary, to initialize the semiconductor memory device by writing
a prescribed datum (0 or 1) into all of the memory cells. For conventional
semiconductor memory devices, such as one of the DRAM type, the memory
cell region is divided into multiple memory blocks known as memory cell
arrays. Consequently, initialization has to be performed for each memory
cell array respectively.Figure 5 is a diagram illustrating a typical configuration of a DRAM
memory cell array. In this figure, for simplifying the explanation, the array
size is schematically represented by 16 columns (X-address) and 8 rows (Y-address).
In this memory cell array, for each row a pair of complementary bit
lines BLi, BLi- are connected via transfer gates TR1 and TR2 to a differential
sense amplifier SAi and a precharge circuit PRi arranged for the row. At the
cross points between one bit line BLi and even-numbered word lines WL0,
WL2,... WL14, memory cells in the even-numbered columns MCi,0, MCi,2,
...MCi,14 are connected. On the other hand, at the cross points between
other bit line BLi- and odd-numbered word lines WL1, WL3, ...WL15,
memory cells in the odd-numbered columns MCi,1, MCi,3, ...MCi,15 are
connected, and the overall memory cell array has 8 rows x 16 columns of
memory cells arranged in a matrix configuration. Each memory cell MCi,j
comprises one transistor and one storage capacitor. With respect to Figure 6, the data read/write operation into the
memory cells of this memory cell array can be explained. As far as the
standby state before the read/write operation is concerned, the equalization
control signal E is at the high (H) level, and transistors TR3, TR4, TR5 of
precharge circuit PRi of each row are ON. A voltage of Vcc/2 is applied to
precharge voltage feed line BLR. From this voltage feed line BLR, bit lines
BLi, BLi- of each line are precharged with a voltage of Vcc/2 via transistors
TR3, TR4, TR5. When external row address strobe signal RAS- falls to the
low L level for read/write operation, equalization control signal
