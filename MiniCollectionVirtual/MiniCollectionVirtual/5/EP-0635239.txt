<ABSTRACT>
Method for manufacturing electrodes, in particular ECG (electrocardiogram) electrodes, in which labels (4) are bonded onto the upper side of a cyclically moved carrier material (1) in the form of a web, whereupon metal connection elements (6a, 6b) are joined to the labels (4) and, finally, individual electrodes are stamped out of the carrier material (1), in the form of a web, with the labels (4), bonded on one after the other, and the connection elements (6a, 6b). A continuous web (4'), coated with an adhesive which can be activated by heat, is fed to a label-application apparatus (10), in which the individual labels are successively stamped out of the web and in each case applied to the carrier material (1) as the adhesive is being heated.

A process for producing electrodes, in particular ECG-electrodes,
wherein stickers (4) are glued on to the top side of a carrier material (1)

in web form, wherein connecting elements (6a, 6b) are connected to the
stickers (4) and finally individual electrodes each having a sticker (4) and

connecting element (6a, 6b) are formed, preferably by being stamped out,
from the carrier material (1) in web form with the stickers (4) successively

glued thereon and the connecting elements (6a, 6b), characterised in that
stickers (4) coated with heat-activatable adhesive (5) are fed to a sticker-applying

apparatus (10) in which the stickers (4) are respectively applied
to the carrier material with heating of the heat-activatable adhesive (5) at

the underside of the sticker which is towards the carrier material (1).
A process according to claim 1 characterised in that the stickers
(4) are fed to the sticker-applying apparatus (10) in the form of individual

stickers which are coated with heat-activatable adhesive (5).
A process according to claim 1 characterised in that the stickers
are fed to the sticker-applying apparatus (10) in the form of a continuous

web (4') which is coated with heat-activatable adhesive (5).
A process according to claim 3 characterised in that in the
sticker-applying apparatus (10) individual stickers (4) are successively

formed from the continuous web (4'), preferably by being stamped out of the
web, and those individual stickers (4) are glued on to the carrier material

(1).
A process according to claim 4 characterised in that the stickers
are stamped out of the web (4') by means of a stamping die and are pressed 

against the carrier material (1) by means of the same stamping die by
continuing the stamping stroke movement.
A process according to claim 3 characterised in that the sticker
web (4') is as such firstly glued on to the carrier material (1) and the

individual stickers (4) are later formed by simultaneously dividing the
carrier material (1) and the glued-on sticker web (4').
A process according to one of claims 1 to 6 characterised in that
the carrier material (1) in web form is heated in the sticker-applying

apparatus (10), preferably from the underside which is remote from the
stickers (4).
A process according to one of claims 1 to 7 characterised in that
upstream of the sticker-applying apparatus (10) holes (21) are stamped out

of the carrier material (1) in web form, each hole (21) being covered in the
sticker-applying apparatus (10) by a larger-diameter sticker (4) or sticker

web (4').
A process according to one of claims 1 to 8 characterised in that
the spacing of the processing or mounting station which follows the sticker-applying

apparatus (10) and the speed of transportation movement of the
carrier material (1) in web form are so selected that the heat-activatable

adhesive (5) is no longer sticky in that following processing or mounting
station due to the cooling effect which has occurred in the meantime.
A process according to one of claims 1 to 9 characterised in that
the sticker web (4') or stickers (4) which are stuck on to the carrier

material (1) in web form are printed upon.
A process according to one of claims 1 to 10 characterised in that
the connecting elements (6a, 6b) are formed by metal rivets, wherein an

upper rivet portion (6a) is moved to the sticker (4) from above and a lower 
rivet portion (6b) is moved to the sticker (4) from below, whereupon the

upper rivet portion (6a) and the lower rivet portion (6b) are riveted
together through the sticker (4).
A process according to one of claims 1 to 11 characterised in that
a sponge (7) is glued on an exposed region of the underside of the sticker,

wherein the heat-activatable adhesive (5) is heated, preferably by means of
hot air, just before and/or upon application of the sponge (7).
A process according to claim 12 characterised in that the sponge
(7) which is in contact with the connecting element (6a, 6b) is filled in

per se known manner with an electrically conductive gel.
A process according to one of claims 1 to 13 characterised in that
the finished electrodes are stamped or cut out of the carrier material (1)

in web form, preferably after the application of a removable covering (17)
to the self-adhesive underside thereof.
A process according to one of claims 1 to 13 characterised in that
the heat-activatable adhesive (5) used is a hot melt adhesive.
A process according to one of claims 1 to 14 characterised in that
a dispersion adhesive is used as the heat-activatable adhesive (5).
Apparatus for carrying out the process according to one of claims
1 to
 16 having a guide and conveyor device for a carrier material (1) in
strip form, characterised by a sticker-applying apparatus (10) for applying

to the carrier material (1) stickers (4) which are coated with heat-activatable
adhesive, wherein a heating device (11) for heating the adhesive

(5) is arranged in the region of the sticker-applying apparatus (10).
Apparatus according to claim 17 characterised in that the sticker-applying
apparatus (10) forms individual stickers (4), preferably by 

stamping, from a continuous web (4') coated with heat-activatable adhesive
(5), and then sticks them on to the carrier material (1).
Apparatus according to claim 17 or claim 18 characterised by a
printing station (12) disposed downstream of the sticker-applying apparatus

(10) for printing on the stickers (4) which are stuck on the carrier
material (1).
Apparatus according to one of claims 17 to 19 characterised by a
device (14) for sticking a sponge (7) on an exposed adhesive region (5) at

the underside of the sticker, wherein said device includes or has disposed
just upstream thereof a heating device (15), preferably a hot air heating

device, for heating the exposed adhesive region (5).
