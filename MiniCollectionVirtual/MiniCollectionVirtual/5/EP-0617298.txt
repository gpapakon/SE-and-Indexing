<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a light barrier (5), in particular for a storage device (1) for medical or dental treatment instruments (4), consisting of a barrier component (6), which defines a free barrier section (9), and an optotransmitter (7) and/or an optoreceiver (8), the light emitted by the optotransmitter (7) is fed to the barrier axis via a light-deflecting element (21), and/or the light coming from the barrier axis is fed to the optoreceiver (8) via a deflecting element (21).

<CLAIMS>
Depository device (1) having a light barrier, for
medical or dental treatment instruments (4), having a forklike

light barrier carrier (6) between the fork heads (11a,
11b) of which there is arranged an exposed barrier path (9)

in the region of a recess (3) for a treatment instrument
(4), and having a light transmitter (7) and a light

receiver (8),

characterised in that,

the light emitted from the light transmitter (7) is
delivered to the barrier axis via a light deflection

element (21), in that the light coming from the barrier
axis is delivered to the light receiver (8) via a light

deflection element (21), in that the light transmitter (7)
and the light receiver (8) are arranged each at a spacing

from the barrier axis in respective optical path sections
(12.1, 12.2) extending transversely with respect to the

exposed barrier path (9), in that the light barrier carrier
(6) has at least a part of the transversely extending

optical path sections (12.1, 12.2) and is formed by a
block-like body having flat upper, lower and reverse sides,

of light permeable material, and in that the light
deflection elements (21) are formed by respective light

refraction surfaces in the form of an oblique outer surface
of the light barrier carrier (6) arranged in the region of

intersection the axes of the exposed light barrier path (9)
and the deflected optical path section (12.1, 12.2).
Light barrier according to claim 1,

characterised in that,

the light transmitter (7) and the light receiver (8) are
arranged distanced from the light barrier carrier (6) and

are connected therewith via flexible light conductors (15).
Light barrier according to any preceding claim,
 
characterised in that,

the light transmitter (7) and the light receiver (8) is or
are arranged on the light barrier carrier (6), on a

separate carrier part or inwardly on a housing wall (26) or
on a circuit board (27).
Light barrier according to any preceding claim,

characterised in that,

the light transmitter (7) and the light receiver (8) are
arranged in the peripheral region of the light barrier

carrier (6)
Light barrier according to claim 2 or 3,

characterised in that,

the light conductors (15) are connected with the light
barrier carrier (6) via a clamping, a screw or a plug-in

connection.
Light barrier according to any preceding claim,

characterised in that,

there are provided in the light barrier carrier (6)
respective holes for receiving the light conductors (15) or

the light transmitter (7) and the light receiver (8).
Light barrier according to any preceding claim,

characterised in that,

the deflection element has a light refraction surface (21)
which refracts the light rays (19) by about 90Â°.
Light barrier according to any preceding claim,

characterised in that,

a section (12.1, 12.2) of the optical path extending in the
light barrier carrier (6) transversely to the barrier path

is formed by a channel or a bore.
Light barrier according to any preceding claim,

characterised in that,
 
the light transmitter (7) and the light receiver (8) can be

put in place on the light barrier carrier (6) in a position
in which they align with the associated optical path

sections (12.2), or vice versa.
Light barrier according to claim 9,

characterised by

a clamping, a screw or a plug-in connection between the
light barrier carrier (6) and the light transmitter (7) and

the light receiver (8).
