<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed to an insulin 
formulation comprising a suspension of Ultralente crystals and a 

total formulation zinc concentration of between about 0.5 
milligrams to about 20 milligrams per 100 units of insulin. 

Greater than fifty percent of the total zinc in the formulation 
resides in the soluble fraction, rather than in complex with the 

insulin. This insulin formulation generally has a pH from 
between about 6.0 to about 7.4. In addition, the insulin 

formulation of the present invention does not contain other 
proteins like protamine. This zinc-modified formulation 

displays characteristics of a very long lasting human insulin 
product.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is in the field of human
medicine, particularly in the treatment of diabetes. Most
specifically, the invention relates to formulations comprising
the human insulin molecule which when administered, more closely
mimic the basal levels of insulin found in the normal human
body.A major therapeutic goal in the treatment of diabetes
is the physiological control of blood glucose levels. Many
different commercial products and formulations are available for
this purpose. For the rapid rise in glucose challenge that
occurs at mealtimes, the fast-acting insulin products, such as
Humulin Regular or the so-called monomeric insulin analogs are
most appropriate.Another important source of glucose load in patients
is the low-level, basal glucose output from the liver. This
output results primarily from postprandial metabolic processes
such as gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. In diabetic
subjects, this basal glucose output can increase substantially
at night and result in extended periods of hyperglycemia,
especially during the early morning hours in an incident
referred to as the dawn phenomenon. These periods of
hyperglycemia have been shown to be an important contributor to
high levels of glycated proteins, often measured clinically as
glycosylated hemoglobin. Buildup of these derivatized protein
products is implicated in the long-term complications associated
with diabetes such as neuropathy, nephropathy and retinopathy. The ideal insulin formulation to deal with this basal
glucose output would be one that resulted in a slow, steady
infusion of insulin into the bloodstream that matched the low
level of glucose output from the liver. In terms of this ideal
basal time action, the best parenteral product that fits this
description is commercially available beef Ultralente insulin.
Injected just once per day, it gives a low, steady release of
insulin into the bloodstream without any noticeable insulin
peak.A major problem with beef Ultralente, however, stems
from the fact that beef insulin is different in amino acid
sequence from human insulin. The human body can recognize
bovine insulin as a foreign protein. Chronic injection of this
immunogenic substance in diabetic patients can result in the
formation of antibodies to the insulin. This can lead to
alterations in insulin time action and potency and other
problems arising from the patient's activated immune system.
For these reasons beef Ultralente remains a non-ideal parenteral
insulin formulation.The advent of recombinant DNA technology and
