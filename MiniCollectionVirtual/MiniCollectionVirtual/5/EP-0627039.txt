<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a drive for a curved sliding door in which a left-hand (3) and right-hand (1) door are moved by means of two motor-driven straps (4, 2). One end of each strap is attached to the front or rear edge of the other door, the strap passing round a guide roller (6, 8) located in the middle between the two doors, thus linking the doors so that when one moves the other is forced to move with it in the opposite direction.

<CLAIMS>
A drive for a curved sliding door equipped with a left-hand (3) and 
a right-hand moving leaf (1), moving on an arc of a circle segment, 

each having the form of an arc of a circle and being mounted on a 
transom for horizontal motor-driven movement, the door leaf being 

connected to the electric motor drive via at least one toothed belt 
trained over pulleys, characterised in that an open drive belt (2, 4) 

is used for each of the moving leaves (1, 3), in that one end (23) of 
the first drive belt (2) is articulated in the region of the front edge 

(10) of the left-hand moving leaf (3) and the other end of the first 
drive belt (2) is articulated in the region of the rear edge (12) of the 

right-hand moving leaf (1), in that the second drive belt (4) is 
articulated by one end in the region of the rear edge (13) of the 

left-hand moving leaf (3) and by its other end (26) in the region of 
the front edge (1 1 ) of the right-hand moving leaf (1), and in that in 

the middle (15) of the circle segment (14) two return pulleys (6, 8) 
are mounted for rotation on a common shaft ((9) so as to be 

neither positively nor non-positively interconnected and the drive 
belt (2) is trained over a first return pulley (6) and the drive belt (4) 

over a second return pulley (8). 
A drive for a curved sliding door according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the drive belts (2, 4) are guided by guide 

pulleys (17, 18). 
A drive for a curved sliding door according to claims 1 and 2, 
characterised in that the drive belts are disposed at different 

levels.
