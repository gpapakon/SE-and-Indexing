<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel bridged azabicyclic
derivatives as substance P antagonists,
pharmaceutical compositions comprising such
compounds and the use of such compounds in the treatment and
prevention of inflammatory and central nervous system
disorders, as well as several other disorders. The
pharmaceutically active compounds of this invention are
substance P antagonists.Substance P is a naturally occurring undecapeptide
belonging to the tachykinin family of peptides, the latter
being named because of their prompt stimulatory action on
smooth muscle tissue. More specifically, substance P is a
pharmacologically active neuropeptide that is produced in
mammals (having originally been isolated from gut) and
possesses a characteristic amino acid sequence that is
illustrated by D. F. Veber etal. in U.S. Patent No.
4,680,283. The wide involvement of substance P and other
tachykinins in the pathophysiology of numerous diseases has
been amply demonstrated in the art. For instance, substance
P has recently been shown to be involved in the transmission
of pain or migraine (see B.E.B. Sandberg etal., Journal of
Medicinal Chemistry, 25, 1009 (1982)), as well as in central
nervous system disorders such as anxiety and schizophrenia,
in respiratory and inflammatory diseases such as asthma and
rheumatoid arthritis, respectively, in rheumatic diseases
such as fibrositis, and in gastrointestinal disorders and
diseases of the GI tract such as ulcerative colitis and
Crohn's disease, etc. (see D. Regoli in "Trends in Cluster
Headache," edited by F. sicuteri et al., Elsevier Scientific
Publishers, Amsterdam, pp. 85-95 (1987)).Attempts have been made to provide antagonists for
substance P and other tachykinin peptides in order to more
effectively treat the various disorders and diseases listed 
above. The few such .antagonists thus far described are
generally divided between peptide-like and non peptide-like
in nature. Peptide-like antagonists are too labile from a
metabolic point of view to serve as practical therapeutic
agents in the treatment of disease. Non-peptidic
antagonists of the present invention, on the other hand, do
not possess this drawback, being far more stable from a
metabolic point of view than the agents referred to above.Quinuclidine derivatives and related compounds that
exhibit activity as substance P receptor antagonists are
referred to in PCT Patent Application WO 90/05729, filed November
20, 1989, United States Patents 5,422,354; 5,641,786 and
