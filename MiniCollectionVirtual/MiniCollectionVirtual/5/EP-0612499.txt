<ABSTRACT>
In this apparatus, which comprises a casing (2), a support (7) having a bearing surface for supporting at least one sheet of paper (8) intended to be printed, an elastomer membrane (diaphragm) (4) stretched in the casing and having one face exposed outside the casing, and an inking roller (6) fixed to a tray (7) which can be moved in the casing in order to ink the other face of the membrane, and including a hard cylindrical core (6a) provided with an outer ink-impregnated lining (6b), the lining (6b) consisting of a thick cylindrical tread of a spongy micropore plastic which contains, in its bulk, ink based on solvents which are heavy, non-volatile, hygroscopic, non-plastifying (non-plasticising) for the said plastic and capable of slowly exuding out of the tread in order to produce the inking.
