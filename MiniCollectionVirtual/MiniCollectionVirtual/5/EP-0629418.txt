<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a needleless
access device for use with liquid flow and
administrative apparatus for medical purposes excluding methods for treatment of the human or animal body
by surgery or therapy and diagnostic methods practised on
the human or animal body.The use of hypodermic needles to inject or
withdraw fluids in medical application has been
standard practice for a number of years. Even where a
patient already has an IV tubing set connected to a
vein, hypodermic needles are frequently used to inject
fluids into the IV tubing. Often a "Y connector" with
a septum is provided in the tubing set for this very
purpose. The needle is used to puncture the septum to
administer the drug or other fluid, and the septum
then sufficiently seals the opening to prevent
airborne bacteria from entering the system. Septums
are also common on drug vials, where the needle is
inserted to withdraw a quantity of the drug.The widespread use of hypodermic needles
leads to numerous needle-stick accidents. These are 
not only painful, but if the needle is contaminated,
could cause serious disease or complications in the
needle-stick victim. There is thus a desire for
needleless medical systems, where a fluid can be
injected or aspirated without the use of a needle, but
while maintaining an aseptic system.U.S. Patent No. 4,683,916 to Rainer
discloses a normally closed reflux valve that allows
for the injection and aspiration of fluids when the
valve is attached to a syringe. However, the valve
has an open inlet area, thus allowing bacterial
contamination inside the inlet and on the valve
components, which would be swept into the system when
a fluid is injected. In addition, this valve is not
designed to allow easy aseptic cleaning treatment of
the valve's syringe contact surface.The present invention includes a needleless access device as claimed in
claim 1 and a method of using the device as claimed in claim 24.The needleless access device of the present
invention is provided with a piston that, in its
normally closed position, seals the inlet opening of
the device to prevent bacterial contamination and
maintain sterility. The design is conducive to
standard septic cleaning of the piston surface which
interfaces with the syringe.Other aspects of the preferred embodiment of
the invention include forming the device with a cap
having an inlet opening and a body with an outlet
opening. A stretchable member provides a biasing
force to hold the piston in a closed position. The
cap and body are sealed together with a
