<ABSTRACT>
The light from image elements, impinging onto elements of a CCD sensor, is transduced into electric output signals used for the image reproduction. For reproduction of brighter image parts are used output signals generated by image light scanning affecting relatively small charge intensity in corresp. part the sensor elements. Correspondingly, darker portions of image are scanned with light effecting a relatively high charging intensity. The output signals for the reproduction of the darker image portions are subjected to level correction. The image is scanned several times such that image light impinging onto corresp. CCD sensor corresp. elements effect different charge intensity during each scanning.
