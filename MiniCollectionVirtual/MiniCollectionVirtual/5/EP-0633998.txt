<ABSTRACT>
Method and device for percussive cleaning of objects (1) arranged in a zone subjected to a processing pressure, in which an elongate percussive element (6) is held under and against the object to be cleaned, and percussive energy is applied by means of an accelerated elongate striker (9, 10). In order to achieve easier balancing of the pressure, at least during the acceleration of the striker, the two ends of the latter are maintained at the same pressure, which essentially corresponds to the pressure in the process zone.

<CLAIMS>
Method for percussively cleaning of objects (1) disposed in a chamber that 
is under process pressure with which an elongated percussive element is 

held in contact with the object to be cleaned, and the percussive energy is 
supplied by means of an accelerated striker element (10),
 
characterized in that at least during the acceleration of the striker element 

(10) both the ends (10a, 10b) of the striker element are maintained under 
one and the same pressure, which pressure corresponds substantially to 

the pressure in the process chamber. 
Method according to claim 1,
 
characterized in that the pressure in the process chamber is detected and 

the pressure that acts upon the two ends of the striker element is 
established as a function of the measured process pressure. 
Method according to claim 1 or 2,
 
characterized in that when viewed in the percussive direction, at a 

distance from that end of the percussive element that is acted upon by the 
striker, a sealing gas is applied in such a way that at most it can exit in a 

direction toward the percussive end of the percussive element. 
Method according ot a least one of the claims 1-3,
 
characterized in that the percussive element is held in contact under 

resilient biasing. 
Apparatus for the percussive cleaning of objects disposed in a process 
chamber that is under process pressure, with a housing (5), an elongated 

percussive element (6) that is guided in the housing in a sealed manner, 
extends through the wall (2) of the process chamber, and rests against the 

object under the effect of a biasing means, and with a percussive 
mechanism (1) including an elongated striker element (10) that is aligned 

with the percussive element (6), whereby the one end (6b) of the 
percussive element and the associated end (10a) of the striker element  

 
extend into a free space (8) of the housing in such a way that in the state 

of rest of the percussive mechanism, the two ends are spaced apart as a 
function of the available percussive energy,
 
characterized in that the percussive element (6) has an essentially 

rectilinear cylindrical configuration, an in that that end (10b) of the striker 
element (10) that projects out of the percussive mechanism which end 

does not face the percussive element (6) is surrounded by a balancing 
chamber (13) that communicates (14; 10d, e) with the free space (8) in 

the housing (5) and is subjected to a pressure (P
13
, P
8
) that corresponds 
essentially to the process pressure (P
2
). 
Apparatus according to claim 5,
 
characterized in that when the percussive element (6) is under the effect of 

a spring (7) the latter is disposed in the free space (8). 
Apparatus according to claim 5 or 6,
 
characterized in that when viewed in the percussive direction, provided 

after a seal means (19) associated with the spring biased end (6b) of the 
percussive element is an annular chamber (18) that can be supplied with a 

sealing gas that is supplied through the housing (5). 
Apparatus according to at least one of the claims 5-7,
 
characterized in that when viewed in the percussive direction, there is 

disposed after the annular chamber (18) a further seal means (20) and/or 
a gas-permeable filter (21). 
Apparatus according to at least one of the claims 5-8,
 
characterized in that that end of the housing (5) that faces the object (1) is 

provided with a guide collar (5d) that surrounds and is spaced from the 
percussive element (6), whereby at the free end (22) of the guide collar 

the percussive element (6) is still guided at a distance from the wall that 
bounds the process chamber (2). 
Apparatus according to at least one of the claims 5-9,
 
characterized in that the free space (8) and the balancing chamber (13) 

are supplied with a lower pressure (Δp) than the annular chamber (18).  
 
Apparatus according to at least one of the claims 5-10,
 
characterized in that the free space (8) and the balancing chamber (13) 

and the annular chamber (18) are supplied with the same pressure, which 
is greater (Δp) than the process pressure. 
Apparatus according to at least one of the claims 5-11,
 
characterized in that a position-detecting mechanism (25) is associated 

with that end (10b) of the striker element (10) that extends into the 
balancing chamber (13) in such a way that alterations in the position of the 

striker element (10) in its striking end position can be detected.
