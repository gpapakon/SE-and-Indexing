<ABSTRACT>
A radio frequency energy radar system (10) has a receiving antenna 
system (16) adjacent to a transmitting antenna system (12). The 

receiving antenna system (16) has a plurality of antenna elements 
(25) disposed in rows and arranged to provide an antenna pattern 

having a main lobe antenna pattern directed toward the target and 
adjacent side lobe antenna pattern. A septum (38) is positioned 

between the transmitting antenna (12) and the receiving antenna 
(16), for shielding the receiving antenna elements (25) from 

unwanted portions of the transmitted CW radio frequency energy. 
The septum (38) terminates along an edge (39) positioned in a 

region forward of the antenna elements (25). The distances (D₁-D
n
, 
L₁-L
n
) between the antenna elements (25) and points (P₁-P
n
) 
along the edge (30) are selected to produce a non-uniform phase 

distribution of unwanted CW energy scattered by the edge (39) and 
received by the receiving antenna elements (25), such phase 

distribution being selected to enable the receiving antenna system 
(16) to focus such unwanted scattered energy into the side lobe 

antenna pattern, thereby decreasing the amount of coupled energy 
from the transmitting antenna system (12) to the receiving antenna 

system (16).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a radio frequency energy radar
system adapted to transmit and receive continuous wave (CW) radio
frequency energy, comprising:
means, coupled to a source of the CW radio frequency
energy, for transmitting and directing CW radio frequency energy
produced by source toward a target; andmeans, spaced from the transmitting means, for receiving
portions of the transmitted CW radio frequency energy reflected by
the target, and more particularly to the isolation between
transmit and receive antennas used in such systems.FR-A-2 096 670 describes a radar system of the kind just
defined in which a transmission antenna and a receiving antenna
are located side-by-side, and compensation means are provided for
reducing the parasitic coupling existing between these antennas.
The compensation means consists of at least one electrical
conductor situated close to the antennas and substantially midway
between the antennas, with one extremity of the conductor
receiving a fraction of the transmitted radiation and its second
extremity radiating into the receiving antenna. The amplitude and
phase of this coupling must be suitably adjusted so as to be
opposed to the parasitic coupling.In one continuous wave radar system, the transmitting
antenna and the receiving antenna are mounted adjacent one another
on a common platform. Both the transmitting antenna and the
receiving antenna have a plurality of horizontal rows of dipole
antenna elements. The antenna elements of each row are coupled,
in-phase, to a common feed port through a corporate feed network.
Thus, each row of antenna elements produces an antenna pattern
having a narrow main lobe, at the centre of the row, directed into 
free space perpendicular to the row. A phase shifting network
connects the feed ports of the transmitting antenna to the
transmitter, and a phase shifting network connects the feed ports
of the receiving antenna to the receiver. The relative phase
shifts in the phase shifting networks enable the transmitting
antenna and the receiving antenna to point their main lobe antenna
patterns at the same desired elevation angle. Thus, the rotation
of the transmitting and receiving antennas together as a unit
about a vertical axis provides an azimuthal scan. Sequentially
changing the relative phase shift provided by the phase shifting
networks provides an elevation scan. During the scan, radio
frequency energy is transmitted by the transmitting antenna and
directed into free space. If the transmitted energy encounters a
radar energy
