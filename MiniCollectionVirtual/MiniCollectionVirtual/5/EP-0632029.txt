<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a benzylidene hydantoin derivative and 
an external preparation for skin and more particularly, a derivative 
having UV-A ultraviolet ray absorption, and an external preparation for 
skin including the same. Various influences of ultraviolet rays to skin, such as 
acceleration of skin aging, have recently been well known. The 
ultraviolet rays included in sunlight are classified into a long 
wavelength ultraviolet ray having a wavelength in a range from 320 nm to 
400 nm as UV-A, a medium wavelength ultraviolet ray having a wavelength 
in a range from 290 nm to 320 nm as UV-B, and a short wavelength 
ultraviolet ray having a wavelength of not more than 290 nm as UV-C in a 
field of skin science. While most of the ultraviolet rays usually irradiated to a human 
body originate in sunlight, the UV-C is absorbed by an ozonosphere and 
the body is mainly influenced by the UV-A and UV-B. Among these, the UV-B forms erythema or blister and causes 
aggravation of melanin formation and chromatosis when the skin is 
irradiated with the UV-B over a certain level. On the other hand, the UV-A causes skin browning, decreasing of  
 
elasticity of skin, generation of wrinkles and acceleration of skin 
aging. Furthermore, UV-A promotes the erythema reaction and reinforces 
the reaction for some patients, and can be a trigger of light poison or 
light allergy. In order to protect the human skin from the UV-A trouble, 
various UV-A absorbents have been developed. The prior UV-A absorbents include a benzophenone derivative, a 
dibenzoylmethane derivative and a benzotriazol derivatives. The UV-A absorbents generally react with a metal ion and are 
colored. Therefore, these have demerit of straining clothes. As a 
result, content of the UV-A absorbent is limited and it is impossible to 
present enough absorptivity of the UV-A light. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to 
eliminate the above-described problems in the prior art and to provide a 
nonpolar base soluble material having a high UV-A ultraviolet ray 
absorptivity. As a result of studies undertaken by the inventors so as to 
attain this aim, it has been found that a new benzylidene hydantoin 
derivative had an excellent UV-A ultraviolet ray absorptivity as well as 
good usability. The present invention has been achieved on the basis of 
this finding. In the invention there is provided a benzylidene hydantoin 
derivative represented by the following formula (1).  in which R¹ represents a straight or branched alkyl group
