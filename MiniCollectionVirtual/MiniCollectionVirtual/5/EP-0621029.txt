<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to compositions, methods and 
kits for dyeing hair. More specifically, the invention relates 
to methods of dyeing hair using oxidizable hair dye precursors in 
which the oxidation is conducted in the presence of at least one 
selected chlorite salt together with selected redox metal salts, 
chelates of such salts and mixtures of said salts and/or 
chelates. The invention relates also to compositions for 
conducting the hair dyeing processes and to the packaged 
reactants sold in the form of a kit. Modern hair dyeing methodology has developed from its 
initiation in the 1950's to the point where, today it is the 
third largest product type in the hair care category following 
shampoos and conditioners.  A wide variety of hair dyes or colorants have been developed 
by the art. These include direct dyes, autoxidative dyes, 
oxidative dyes and dyes which achieve their desired effect by 
conversion to a melanin. These latter dyes include 
dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) 5,6-dihydroxyindole (DHI) and 
related compounds such as 5,6-dihydroxyindole carboxylic acid 
(DHICA) and its lower alkyl esters as well as N-lower alkyl 
derivatives of these compounds and acyloxy analogs such as 5,6-diacetoxyindole 
(DAI). The most commonly used method of dyeing hair, particularly 
human hair, is oxidative dyeing in which a mixture of aromatic 
compounds, generally of the benzenoid series, containing a 
plurality of amino and hydroxy functions, which are themselves 
colorless, are converted by coupling reactions and oxidative 
processes, both known to those skilled in the art, to a blend of 
colored compounds within the hair fibers. The colorless aromatic 
compounds, in a suitable base formulation, normally are mixed 
with hydrogen peroxide or other strong oxidizing agent shortly 
before use. The colored compounds or dyes, typically, are formed 
by oxidative coupling between primary intermediates (usually 
diaminobenzenes or aminophenols) and couplers which are phenols 
or related cyclic compounds. Different shades are developed by 
using a mixture containing more than one of both the intermediate 
and the coupler.  It is also known to dye hair with certain compounds which, 
while they are useful as primary intermediates in association 
with couplers, may also be used alone since they may be directly 
oxidized either with an oxidizing agent or, with certain of the 
more sensitive compounds, by exposure to air. The oxidized 
primary intermediate can couple with unoxidized primary 
intermediate to
