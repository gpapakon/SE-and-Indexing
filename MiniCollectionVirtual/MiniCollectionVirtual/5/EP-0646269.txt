<DESCRIPTION>
 ELECTROMAGNETIC-WAVE MODULATING, MOVABLE ELECTRODE, CAPACITOR ELEMENTSTECHNICAL FIELDThe present invention relates to electromagnetic-wave modulating, movable electrode, capacitor elements. Preferred embodiments provide a reflective light modulating capacitor pixel for full-color displays, especially reflective displays.Generally, light modulating capacitors comprise at least one fixed electrode and a movable active electrode made of metallized plastic film. Such capacitors are known from Kalt US Patent 3,989,357 and can be used to modulate other electromagnetic waves besides light. Modulation of light is achieved by physical displacement of the active electrode with respect to the fixed electrode, changing the reflective or light-transmissive characteristics of the device. Actuation of the active electrode is accomplished by electrostatically attracting or repelling the variable electrode to a desired position. In the case of an active electrode made of metallized MYLARÂ® polyester film, the electrode is light, may be prestressed to increase the range of configuration possibilities, and requires low power and low voltage to operate effectively and quickly.When I first proposed such a device in the early 1970's, the active electrode generally had the shape of a flapper which was electrostatically driven from one position to another, typically in a two color grove having a V shaped 

cross-section, much like a pair of differently colored pages in a half-opened book, see, for example, U.S. Patent 3,989,357. Because the flapper is highly reflective, when it is in a first position, it reflects the color of the inside of the groove on the side of the groove opposite that on which it is resting. Thus, with each side of the groove is given a different color, the groove appears be to completely the color of the side opposite the active electrode. Because this could be a reflective device, it operated well in ambient light and with only the smallest consumption of electricity insofar as the light modulating capacitor would only pass enough current to charge its internal capacitance.The following five paragraphs were included in May 1993My prior US Patent No. 3,989,357 discloses various light- modulating movable electrodes cooperative with a reflective backdrop to provide a reflectance zone whose reflectance properties can be controlled by appropriate selection of the reflectances of a viewer-facing electrode surface and of the backdrop. In this manner, simple messages, message elements or color pixels can be
