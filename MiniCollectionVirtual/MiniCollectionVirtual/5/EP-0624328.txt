<ABSTRACT>
The utility model in question relates to a locking and unlocking device for chairs in which the seat is fixed to a support (10) that tilts on a fixed component and relative to this fixed component, which has a row of parallel plates (11). The device comprises a rigid tie (13) which extends through the plates (11) and is shifted axially from the locked position to the unlocked position by means of a lever and with the help of a spring (14) which normally tends to keep the tie (13) in the locked position. The operating lever (14) acts on the tie (13) through an intermediate ball (20) and has a radial cavity (22) into which part of the ball (20) fits in order to define the locked position of the tie (13).
