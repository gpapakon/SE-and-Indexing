<ABSTRACT>
An ultra light poppet valve (10) for an internal combustion engine. The 
valve is formed by cold forming a blank (12a) into an elongated cup having an 

extremely thin wall and a flared open end onto which a cap is welded, the bottom 
end (16) of the cup which defines the tip end of the valve having a wall section 

which is substantially of the thickness of the original blank. In accordance with 

one aspect of the invention, a keeper groove (26) is formed adjacent the tip end 
as part of the cold forming process.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to poppet valves for internal
combustion engines, and more particularly to a valve which is of exceptionally light
weight while maintaining high strength-to-weight characteristics.Internal combustion engine poppet valves are most commonly fabricated by
machining, forging or extruding a solid blank of high-strength, heat resistant metal
and then subjecting the blank to finish machining and/or grinding operations. In
some applications, performance requirements make it necessary to provide a valve
having a hollow stem into which a coolant such as sodium may be added during
the fabrication process. In the prior art, such hollow stems have been formed by
means such as drilling the stem or by extruding or forging the stem over a mandrel
or a removable core. United States Patent No. 5,054,195 discloses a poppet valve
which is fabricated by cold forming a tubular blank to a desired stem diameter,
shaping the transition region between the stem diameter and the blank diameter
into an arc to define the fillet portion of the valve by means of a kneading process
or the like, cutting off the blank at or near the outer diameter of the fillet portion,
attaching a cap which defines the head of the valve, and then adding an additional
part to close the cavity at the tip end of the valve. A known hot extrusion process
is described in JP-A-63 109206, in this hot extrusion process a block is formed
and extruded to form a valve stem, following which a cap is secured in place.
Another form of known valve is described in FR-A-2 072 186, in which part of the
stem is hollow but the tip region is of solid construction. JP 63-306212 discloses a hollow engine valve. A weight saving over other valves is
made by use of a pipe for the stem portion with a flared end portion. A cap is attached to the
flared end by a subsequent process. The hollow stem portion is closed off at the other end of
the pipe portion by insertion of a plug or filler member. It is also suggested that another
method of forming a pipe closed at one end is by use of a deep drawing process. While hollow valves produced by the known fabrication process are
significantly lighter than prior art solid valves, increasingly stringent standards of
performance, fuel economy and emission control require further weight reduction
which is not considered to be economically attainable by the prior art processes.
Furthermore, current development work in camless valve actuation, wherein the
valve is opened and closed directly by an

portion (16) defining a transition region between said stem portion and said cap
portion; said cap portion being defined by a disk-like cap member fixed to said fillet

portion, and wherein said stem portion, said tip portion and said fillet portion are
defined by a one-piece, hollow cylindrical member which is open at the fillet end

thereof and closed at the tip end, characterised in that said one-piece hollow
cylindrical member is made from a ductile metal sheet formed such that said fillet

portion has a first maximum wall thickness t
