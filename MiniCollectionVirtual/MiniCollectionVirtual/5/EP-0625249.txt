<ABSTRACT>
A double seat valve has two serially arranged closure members (5, 6) that are movable with respect to each other, that prevent in the closed position of the valve fluids from overflowing from a first part (1a) into a second part (1b) of the valve housing, and that delimit both in the closed and in the open position a leakage cavity (3) in communication with the surroundings of the valve through a pipe (5b) linked to the independently driven first closure member (5) and that extends outwardly through the adjacent first part (1a) of the valve housing. Valve rods (5a, 6a) for the closure members (5, 6) that are concentrically arranged inside each other extend unilaterally outwards through the second part (1b) of the valve housing. The disclosed double seat valve satisfies the requirement for a leakage cavity that can not only be drained, but also pressure-relieved in all imaginable operating conditions. For that purpose, the valve rod of the second closure member (6), designed as a hollow rod (6a), inwardly delimits a part (6d) of a connection path (15) which is enlarged up to a throughflow cross-section (Q) immediately after the leakage cavity (3) and in a part of its ulterior course, thus increasing the space available for the leakage cavity (3).

A double seat valve with two serially mounted closure 
elements (5, 6) movable relative to each other which 

prevent overflow of fluids from a first valve housing 
element (la) to a second (1b) when the valve is in the 

closed position and which in both the closed and the 
open position delimit a leakage cavity (3)

connected to the environment of the valve
 by means of a 
pipe (5b) connected with an independently actuated 

first closure element (5) and extending to and beyond 
the adjacent first valve housing element (la), to the 

second closure element (6) against which during its 
opening movement the first closure element (5) comes to 

rest, also transferring the latter to the open 
position, and to valve rods (5a, 6a) which are mounted 

concentrically one within the other for the closure 
elements (5, 6) and which extend through and beyond the 

second valve housing element (1b) on one side, 

characterized in that
 the valve rod of the second 
closure element (6), designed as a hollow rod (6a), has 

on the inside a reservoir (6d) immediately adjoining 
the leakage cavity (3) and increases the latter by the 

amount of its storage volume beyond the extent 
mechanically necessary for the combined action of the
