<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid crystal
display apparatus in which a liquid crystal display
element having a fast responding characteristic is used.
In particular, the present invention relates to a passive
matrix type liquid crystal display apparatus wherein row
selection voltages are generated by a multiple line
selection method.Heretofore, a liquid crystal display element
responding to the effective value of a voltage applied,
such as a supertwisted nematic (STN) liquid crystal
element has been practically used. In order to improve
the switching speed for a display, a liquid crystal
element having a fast responding characteristic has been
desired. However, the liquid crystal element having a
fast responding characteristic had a problem that an
optical difference was small between an ON state and an
OFF state whereby contrast was poor.As a generally used liquid crystal driving method, 
there is a successive line addressing method which
selects and drives for each scanning line, each element
of a liquid crystal element in which the elements are
arranged in a matrix form. When the successive line
addressing method is used for a liquid crystal element
having a response time of about 200 msec which is not so
high, the response time is relatively long in comparison
with the period of the waveform of a voltage for the
successive line addressing method. However, when the
response time is short as about 20-100 msec, the response
time becomes close to the period of the waveform of the
voltage for the successive line addressing method. As a
result, it happens that a pixel which is in an ON state
in a selection period in the successive line addressing
returns to be in an OFF state during a non-selection
period. Namely, the difference of brightness between the
ON state and the OFF state is small. Such phenomenon is
called a frame response.In order to eliminate the frame response, it is
considered to increase the frequency of the voltage for
the successive line addressing in response to an
increased response speed of the liquid crystal element.
However, a high frequency causes ununiformity in a
display because the frequency spectrum of a voltage
waveform applied to the element becomes high.As a driving method to eliminate the above-mentioned
problem, a multiple line selection method (MLS method) 
for selecting a plurality of scanning lines as a batch is
proposed. When a plurality of scanning lines are
simultaneously selected for driving, a period of
selection signals applied to a single row electrode
