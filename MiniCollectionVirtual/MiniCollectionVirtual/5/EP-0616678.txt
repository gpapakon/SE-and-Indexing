<ABSTRACT>
A heat exchanger of the type having a stack of heat exchange units (14) each formed from first and second thin plates (30, 32) having grooves and ribs, wherein the grooves and ribs on facing surfaces of the first and second plates of a unit cross one another and co-operate to define a first flow path, and grooves and ribs on facing surfaces of first and second plates (30, 32) of adjacent units cross one another and co-operate to define a second flow path, wherein the ribs and grooves have transverse projections formed therein to provide the second flow path with a cross-sectional area exceeding the cross-sectional area of the first flow path.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to heat exchangers, and in 
particular, to plate type heat exchangers used in 
automotive applications as oil coolers. It is known to provide oil coolers for vehicle 
engines, which are arranged between an engine block and an 
oil filter and connected to an engine cooling system to 
permit a cooling liquid, such as water, to pass in heat 
exchange relationship with oil flowing through the oil 
cooler. In EP-A-0 430 752 A1 
there is disclosed circumferential flow heat exchangers 
having a stack of like heat exchange units or plate pairs, 
each formed from first and second plates, wherein the 
plates of each unit co-operate to define a first or oil 
flow path and the plates of a pair of adjacent units cooperate 
to define a second or water flow path with the 
cross-sectional areas of such flow paths being essentially 
equal. Such heat exchangers are effective in controlling 
movement, i.e. mixing or turbulence, of oil along the first 
flow paths in a manner which tends to maximize exposure 
thereof to heat transfer contact with flow bounding 
surfaces of the plates. The present invention is an 
improvement over such heat exchangers, especially in the 
lower range of oil flow rates. In accordance with the present invention, the 
configuration of the first and second plates forming the 
heat exchange units allows for the cross-sectional areas of 
the first and second flow paths defined by each unit and a 
pair of adjacent units to be selectively varied in size, as  
 
required, to optimize oil heat transfer characteristics 
throughout the full range of oil flow rates typically 
encountered in vehicle engines. In the present invention, a heat exchange unit for a 
heat exchanger has first and second plates having 
outer oppositely and inner oppositely facing surfaces. The plates have 
elongate outwardly opening grooves and elongate outer ribs 
arranged between said outer grooves and extending co-directionally 
therewith. The outer grooves form inwardly 
disposed ribs in the inner surfaces arranged in an engaged 
crossing relationship. The outer ribs form inwardly 
disposed inner grooves crossing to define a first flow 
path. The plates have flow inlet and outlet openings 
communicating with opposite ends of the first flow path. 
The invention is characterized by the outer ribs having 
crest portions with outwardly disposed projections formed 
therein, such that when a plurality of said units are 
arranged in a stack with the first plate outer surfaces in 
abutting engagement with the
