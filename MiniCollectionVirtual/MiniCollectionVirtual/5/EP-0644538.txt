<ABSTRACT>
In magnetooptic recording, 
this invention compensates 

for the change of temperature 
rise/drop characteristics of a 

medium in a heating/cooling 
process with rise/fall of a laser 

beam depending on a relative 
speed between the laser beam 

and the recording medium. This 
invention accomplishes a high 

recording density and high access 
performance as the advantages of 

a Z-CAV system, and improves 
reliability when a high density 

recording is made in a CAV 
system, too. Specifically, the 

relative speed of the laser beam 
to the medium, that is, the linear 

velocity of the medium is related 
to the thermal time constant of 

the medium to determine the 
thermal time constant τ at that 

linear velocity. Information to be 
recorded is converted to a binary 

signal, and the magnetooptic 
medium is irradiated with an 

intensity-modified laser beam 
according to the binary signal 

so as to record information. 
Information of thermal time 

constants relating to the 
temperature change of the magnetooptic recording medium due to the laser irradiation are in advance recorded in the 

magnetooptic recording medium. A clock frequency (f) is controlled so that T/τ, the ratio of the reciprocal T of the 
clock frequency (f) to the thermal time constant τ of the medium can be kept constant. The start and end positions 

of a mark can be accurately formed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magnetooptic 
recording method, a magnetooptic recording medium and a 
magnetooptic recording apparatus. While magnetooptic recording media capable of storing 
information with high densities are expected to come into 
wide use as large-capacity external memories, of these media 
an optical disc is attracting notice as an external memory 
for computers on the ground that it can effect the playback 
at a high speed. While there have been proposed various 
kinds of magnetooptic recording media which are different 
information storing method and size, in accordance with the 
ISO standards, the magnetooptic recording medium of the 
write-once type capable of writing information only once and 
the magnetooptic type capable of erasing the information 
have been standardized with respect to the size of 5.25 
inches in diameter, whereas the ROM type and the magnetooptic 
type used exclusively for playback purposes as well as the 
partial ROM type featuring the coexistence of the 
magnetooptic type and the ROM type have been standardized 
with respect to the size of 3.5 inches in diameter, and these  
 
types are expected to be put on a still wider market in the 
future. Also, recently the application of the optical disc has 
also been started in the field of digital audio. For 
instance, players have been put on the market in which the 
write-once type optical disc or magnetooptic disc is used 
as a master source in a digital multiple track recording of 
24 to 48 tracks. In addition to these products adapted for 
use by the specialists, there has been the advant of products 
adapted for use by the general consumers, such as, a CD-R (a 
compact disc of the write-once type) and an MD (miniature 
disc) and their future trend attracts notice. In these optical discs, the guides for orderly arranging 
the information marks by the laser beam from an optical 
pick-up of a recording and playback apparatus, i.e., the 
guides for tracking purposes are formed in the form of 
recessed or raised grooves spirally from the inner periphery 
toward the outer periphery of the disc. These grooves are 
called as guide grooves. Explaining the guide grooves in greater detail, as 
defined according to the ISO standards, those portions 
constituting the recesser or the far portions as looked from 
the optical pick-up are called as lands and the other 
portions constituting the raised portions or the near 
portions as looked from the pick-up are called as grooves.
