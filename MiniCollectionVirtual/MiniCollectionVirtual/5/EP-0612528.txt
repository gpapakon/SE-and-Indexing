<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to solutions for 
peritoneal dialysis that contain an osmotic substance which 
is an alternative to glucose. Peritoneal dialysis is a treatment for acute or 
chronic renal failure that is considered on an equal level 
with hemodialysis and kidney transplantation. Recent 
studies have shown that the survival of patients treated 
continuously by peritoneal dialysis can be compared with 
that of patients treated by hemodialysis, that 
complications involving peritonitis are significantly 
reduced, and that alterations of the peritoneal membrane 
are scarcely relevant when complications involving 
peritonitis are prevented and when dialysis solutions that 
are as physiological as possible are used. Peritoneal dialysis solutions are similar to plasma in 
their electrolytic composition and are sterile solutions 
which are checked for the limit of bacterial endotoxins. 
The quality of peritoneal dialysis solutions has been 
improved considerably thanks to the increasing attention 
paid to the evaluation of the raw materials used and of the 
production processes. Peritoneal dialysis solutions have variable 
compositions. The main components of these solutions 
include ions of sodium, potassium, magnesium, acetate or 
lactate, chlorides and glucose in a variable percentage 
which is in any case comprised between 1% and 5%. Glucose 
is the largest osmotic component of the solution. Known formulae for peritoneal dialysis may or may not 
contain bicarbonate. However, the formulae that contain  
 
bicarbonate are less preferred, since their components 
(potassium and calcium salts) precipitate at the basic pH 
of a bicarbonate-containing solution when they are mixed 
together. Known peritoneal dialysis solutions contain variable 
concentrations of osmotically active substances. Currently, 
the only osmotic substance used to induce ultrafiltration 
in peritoneal dialysis is glucose. In practice, solutions 
that have an osmolarity of 200 to 600 mOsm/l are used. 
Theoretical osmolarity is given by the sum of the mmols of 
the various components (ions and glucose). Although glucose is effective in subtracting liquids, 
its use in peritoneal dialysis solutions is not free from 
drawbacks. The high concentrations in glucose and 
degradation products thereof in fact have negative effects 
on the peritoneal membrane. Besides, the high reabsorption 
of glucose from the dialysis solution alters glycolipid 
metabolism, can cause obesity and facilitate 
hypertriglyceridemia, glucose intolerance,
