<ABSTRACT>
An object of the present invention is to provide a diagnosis apparatus capable of diagnosing a disease in the 
same manner as a skilled doctor on the basis of a detected pulse wave. The diagnosis apparatus consists of an analysis 

unit for generating waveform parameters of a pulse wave obtained from an organism, on the basis of information 
representing the pulse wave, and a diagnosis unit for determining the nature of a disease of an organism on the basis of 

the waveform parameters. A microcomputer (21) supports the analysis unit and diagnosis unit. The data representative 
of the relation between the data representative of a pulse wave of an organism and those representative of the condition 

of the organism are stored in advance in a data base (26), and the diagnosis of a disease is carried out by finding 
which data representing the condition of an organism corresponds to the data on a pulse wave actually detected.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a diagnostic apparatus for performing diagnostics based
on parameter data obtained from the pulse waves generated by a living body, preferably including a
pulse wave analyzing apparatus for generating the parameter data representing the pulse
waves of the living body.The traditional medicine, for example, the Chinese medicine has long practiced pulse
taking at three locations (Chun, Guan, and Chi) on an arm along the radial artery. Also, there is
a method for taking pulses automatically with three piezoelectric elements which are
respectively pressed at the three points. (Japanese Patent Application (JPA), Second Publication,
S57-52054). Further, to equalize the finger pressure of the piezoelectric elements, it is known
that air pressure is used to press down the piezoelectric elements (JPA, First Publication, H04-9139).On the other hand, a technique called Ayurveda has been known in traditional Indian
medicine from ancient times. This method will be explained with reference to Figures 3 (A)
and (B).An examiner places his finger lightly on three locations along the radial artery of an
examinee. The three locations shown in Figure 3 (A) are referred to as Vata (V), Pitta (P) and
Kapha (K), and correspond roughly to the three location in the Chinese Medicine known as the
Chun, Guan and Chi. The examiner places his second finger on Vata (V), his third finger on
Pitta (P) and his fourth finger on Kapha (K), and checks the pulsing motions at the variant
depths.Next, the examiner performs a diagnostic analysis of the health condition of the examinee
based on the sections and strength of the examinee's pulse felt at the four points on his one
finger as illustrated in Figure 3 (B). It follows, therefore, that with the three fingers, he can
perform the diagnostic analysis based on a total of twelve points. Such wrist pulse method and the Ayurveda technique are said to provide excellent
diagnostics, but because these techniques are dependent on the accumulated experience and
the sensation felt by the Examiner, the techniques are difficult to be fully mastered. In
particular, diagnosis by the Ayurveda method is restricted to those with extreme sensitivity at
the finger tip, which can number as little as one in a thousand, or one in several thousand
people. Moreover, even for those with sensitive touch, unless they have many years of
training, they cannot make an accurate diagnosis.As described above, the pulse waves are useful index of the conditions of a living
body, and
