<ABSTRACT>
Zein, zein bodies, glutelins or destarched corn gluten are extracted and purified from corn gluten meal by efficiently removing and recovering food grade pigments and starch hydrolysates, while discarding unwanted fractions. Corn gluten is subjected to the combination of enzymatic starch hydrolysis, alkaline treatment, alcohol washing, alcohol extraction, carbon or ion exchange resin purification, and precipitation to produce a substantially starch-free, deflavored and decolored zein which is suitable for use in foods and pharmaceuticals. An advantage of the process is its use of food grade alcohol(s) to deflavor, decolorize, and extract the zein from corn gluten meal. Deflavored, decolored and destarched corn gluten, zein bodies or glutelins are also obtained and are useful as vegetable protein supplements. By-products of the invention such as yellow food pigments and starch hydrolysates can be further purified and/or used directly in various foods.

<DESCRIPTION>
A primary by-product of commercial corn wet milling
is wet corn gluten meal (CGM) which is typically concentrated
and sold in dry form (approximately 90% solids).
CGM is known to be most stable in dry form. Zein can be
readily obtained by further processing of corn gluten
meal. The potential yield of zein is about 12.9 gdm-3 (one pound per
bushel of corn).Corn gluten has been processed into varying grades
of zein depending upon the particular end use, i.e., for
use in plastics, protective coatings, inks, food products,
pigments, adhesives and films, among other uses. In food
applications, the quality of the zein is of paramount
importance to the overall organoleptic properties of the
food product. For instance, currently available grades
of zein contain impurities that can impart off-flavors
and colors (particularly yellow color - due to the
presence of xanthophyll and carotene pigments) to the
food product. Further processing of the zein to remove
undesirable colors and off-flavors has been developed
with limited success, particularly for use in foods.Processes for producing "white" zein by extraction
with ethylene dichloride (Mason and Palmer, J. Biol.
Chem. 107:131-132 (1934)), benzene (U.S. Patent No.
2,133,591 issued to Swallen) and other hydrocarbons
(U.S. Patent Nos. 2,287,649 and 2,272,488 both issued to
Swallen; U.S. Patent No. 2,229,870 issued to Pearce) have
been described. Although the product has minimal color,
the use of these solvents make the "white" zein unacceptable
for use in the food and pharmaceutical industry. Enzymatic modification of corn gluten by proteolytic
hydrolysis to produce a flour-like material was previously
described by Adler-Nissen (U.S. Patent 4,100,151).
Enzyme hydrolysis of crude gluten using alpha-amylase has
also been described by Knight (U.S. Patent No. 3,782,964).
In both of these processes, the product generated is a
modified gluten rather than zein.Alcohol extraction of corn gluten to obtain zein has
been described by Lawhorn (U.S. Patent No. 4,624,805),
Chen and Hoff (U.S. Patent No. 4,716,218), Coleman (U.S.
Patent No. 2,355,056), Carter and Reck (U.S. Patent No.
3,535,305) and Swallen (U.S. Patent Nos. 2,287,649,
2,332,356, 2,105,760, 2,120,946, 2,133,591 and 2,272,488).
In each instance, zein is extracted using a solvent
(e.g., ethanol, isopropanol) and concentration for which
zein is soluble therein.Derwent Abstract 88-254487 (JP-A-63185998) discloses a method of
producing zein from corn or corn gluten meal by dissolution in 75-95 vol%
hydrous ethanol

comprising removing color and flavor impurities from the
gluten by treating corn gluten with alkali to remove fatty

acids and corn oils contained therein and then with an
aqueous alcoholic solvent having a concentration which does

not substantially extract zein, zein bodies and glutelins
