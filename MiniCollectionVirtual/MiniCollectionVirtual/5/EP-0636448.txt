<ABSTRACT>
Unit for the accurate indexing of a load-carrying pallet in the reference frame of a workstation, especially one served by a conveyor, by means of which unit the pallet is raised above the plane on which it moves, characterised in that this unit comprises a mounting plate (1) for fastening it, under the plane on which the pallet moves, to a framework element belonging to the reference frame of the workstation, this mounting plate being equipped with two pairs of guides (4) for lifting stanchions (8) perpendicular to its plane, and a driving device for actuating the stanchions (8) in synchronism, these sliding in their guide (4), which device comprises a balance beam (16, 17, 18, 30, 42) which can move relative to the mounting plate (1) in a path defined by the guide means (13, 32) secured to the mounting plate, and a driving member (22) coupled between the balance beam and the mounting plate (1), the balance beam including means (11, 34, 41) interacting with each one of the stanchions (8) for converting the movement of the balance beam relative to the mounting plate into a synchronised at least upwards vertical movement of each of the stanchions (8) in the guides (4).

An accurate indexing unit for indexing a load-carrying pallet in
the frame of reference of a workstation, in particular a workstation

served by a conveyor, whereby the pallet is raised above its
displacement plane, the unit comprising a plate (1) enabling it to be

fixed beneath the displacement plane of the pallet to a frame element
belonging to the frame of reference of the workstation, said plate

being fitted with two pairs of guides (4) for lift-pins (8)
perpendicular to its plane, and with a drive device for synchronously

actuating the lift-pins (8) which slide in their respective guides
(4), the drive device comprising a yoke (15) movable relative to the

plate (1) along a trajectory defined by guide means (13, 32) secured
to the plate, and by a drive member (22) coupled between the yoke and

the plate (1), the yoke including means (11, 34, 41) co-operating
with each of the lift-pins (8) to transform the movement of the yoke

relative to the plate into synchronized vertical movement at least in
the upwards direction of each of the lift-pins (8) in the guides (4),

the unit being characterized in that the yoke (15) is H-shaped with
each of the limbs (16, 17, 30) thereof co-operating with at least two

lift-pins (8) and with the cross-member (18) thereof carrying a hinge
pin (19) for the end (20) of an actuator (21, 22) whose other end is

hinged (25) to the plate (1).
A unit according to claim 1, characterized in that the means for
guiding the yoke relative to the plate (1) comprise hinged links (13)

that keep the yoke parallel to itself while it moves relative to the
plate.
A unit according to claim 1, characterized in that the means for
guiding the yoke include wheels (32) defining a guide plane parallel

to the plate (1).
A unit according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in
that the means co-operating with the lift-pins (8) comprise links

(11) hinged between the yoke and each of the lift-pins. 
A unit according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in
that the means co-operating with the lift-pins (8) have bearing

surfaces (34, 41, 42) for the bottom ends of the lift-pins.
A unit according to claims 3 and 5, characterized in that the
bearing surfaces form camming surfaces (34, 41) including a zone that

is inclined relative to the guide plane interconnecting two zones
that are parallel to said plane.
A unit according to any preceding claim, characterized in that an
abutment (27) secured to the plate (1) is disposed facing the yoke

(15) to limit movement thereof in the lift-pin-raising direction.
A unit according to any preceding claim, characterized in that

each lift-pin guide comprises a cylindrical sleeve (4) mounted in an
orifice (2) of the plate and including a shoulder (6) to bear against

the plate, said sleeve having an extension (5) beneath the plate to
form a support for the portion of the guide means (13, 32) of the

yoke that is coupled to or supported by the plate (1).
