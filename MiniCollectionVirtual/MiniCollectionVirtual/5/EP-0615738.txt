<ABSTRACT>
To prevent body fluids from flowing backward through a 
liquid-permeable topsheet 2 for use in body fluids absorptive 

goods 1, the topsheet 2 is formed by a nonwoven fabric made of 
thermoplastic synthetic fibers appropriately fused together 

and the sheet 2 is provided with openings 16 and a skin-contacting 
region 17 continuously extending around the 

openings 16. A first zone 11 of the topsheet 2 has a water-resistance 
at least in the skin-contacting region which is 

higher than a water-resistance in a second zone 12, 13 
extending outside the first zone 11 so as to suppress a back 

flow of body fluids possibly occurring in the skin-contacting 
region 17.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid-permeable
topsheet for use in body fluids absorptive goods such as
disposable diapers and sanitary napkins.It is well known to make a liquid-permeable topsheet for
use in body fluids absorptive goods from a nonwoven fabric
consisting of thermoplastic synthetic fibers appropriately
fused together and to provide this sheet with a plurality of
openings through which body fluids can be guided toward an
absorbent core, with an upper surface of the sheet being
adapted to be in contact with the wearer's skin and a lower
surface of the sheet being adapted to be in contact with the
absorbent core.For example, US Patent No. 4,741,941 discloses a
technique to make a topsheet having liquid passages as the
above-mentioned openings utilizing the process of making melt
blown nonwoven fabric or spun-bonded nonwoven fabric.Japanese patent application Disclosure Gazette No. 1992-89054
discloses a technique of making a topsheet, in which
the above-mentioned openings are formed as liquid passages
from a part of melt blown nonwoven fabric and these liquid 
passages are made air-permeable.Both techniques as mentioned above certainly provide the
topsheet made of melt blown fibers which are sufficient fine
to provide the topsheet of comfortable touch. In addition,
such topsheet contains a plurality of interstices
contributing to improvement of air-permeability between the
wearer's skin and habiliments. On the other hand, however,
the presence of these fiber interstices may cause body fluids
permeating through the topsheet to flow backward from the
absorbent core to the wearer's skin under a pressure of the
wearer's body weight.In view of such a problem left by the prior art behind
unsolved, it is a principal object of the invention to
provide a topsheet for use in body fluids absorptive goods
having openings functioning to guide body fluids from the
upper side to an absorbent core underlying the lower side of
the topsheet and a skin-contacting area continuously
surrounding the openings. Further it could be noted that: EP-A-4781962 discloses a
topsheet composed of hydrophobic fibers having two sections of which
the fiber density are high and low, US-A-4781962 shows a topsheet of
nonwoven material having densified and fused areas which are in
alignment with perforations in a film layer, EP-A-0495212 deals with a
topsheet consisting of nonwoven fabric having an air permeability and
micropores; and WO-A-91/14414 discloses a topsheet of nonwoven fabric
comprising hydrophobic fibers which
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A topsheet for use in body fluids absorptive goods having a
crotch area, said topsheet (2) being formed by a nonwoven fabric made

of thermoplastic synthetic fibers appropriately fused together
characterised in that said topsheet (2) defines a first zone (11) of

relatively high water-resistance
longitudinally extending in

said crotch area and a
second zone (12, 13) of relatively low water-resistance surrounding

said first zone (11), the fabric including openings (16) adapted in
use to guide body fluids from a top surface of the topsheet (2) to an

absorbent core (4) underlying a bottom surface of the topsheet.
A topsheet according to claim 1, wherein said second zone
(12, 13) has its water-resistance gradually decreasing as the distance

from said first zone (11) becomes greater.
A topsheet according to claim 1, wherein said first and
second zones (11, 12, 13) have fiber interstices which are filled up

closer together than the remaining zone.
