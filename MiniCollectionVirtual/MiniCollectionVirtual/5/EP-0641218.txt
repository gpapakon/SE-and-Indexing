<ABSTRACT>
The invention involves a method for treating a human survivor of a heart attack and provides further improvement in survival following the heart attack by the early initiation and long-term administration of a renin-angiotensin system inhibitor, preferably an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. The inhibitor may be used on its own, or in conjuction with other therapeutic compounds such as  beta blockers and thrombolytic agents. The preferred inhibitor is captopril.

<DESCRIPTION>
Survivors of acute myocardial infarction are at greatly increased risk for subsequent fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events (1). This heightened risk is not a uniform one, but rather is influenced by many factors such as age, co-morbid diseases, extent of coronary artery disease, electrical stability, and, most importantly, the severity of left ventricular dysfunction. Irrespective of how the latter is measured (ventricular volumes, ejection fraction, contraction score), the severity of dysfunction correlates highly with mortality and thus is useful in stratifying survivors of acute myocardial infarction into categories of varying risk (2,3,4,5). Of these indices of left ventricular impairment, the most powerful predictor of survival is ventricular volume (4,5).In a rat model of myocardial infarction produced by ligation of the left coronary artery, progressive left ventricular dilation has been shown to occur as a function of the size and age of the infarct (6,7). During the acute post-infarction phase, prior to scar formation, an increase in ventricular diastolic volume occurs as a consequence of infarct expansion and a rise in filling pressure (8,9). Following formation of a discrete. scar, left ventricular dilation may continue as the result of a remodeling of the residual viable myocardium, initially acting to restore stroke volume (9, 10). If the infarct is of sufficient size, the increase in diastolic volume may progress, leading to further deterioration in ventricular performance and perpetuation of the dilatation (11). In a rat model of myocardial infarction, the chronic administration of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, has been shown to attenuate this gradual dilatation of the left ventricle both by remodeling its structure and reducing its distending pressure, leading to an improvement in cardiac function (12) and, in long-term studies, a prolongation of survival (12,13).Although this animal data is encouraging, it is by no means predictive of what will happen in humans. In fact, the NIH has been critical of pre-clinical data based upon rat models (personal communication), and a recent clinical trial based upon rat data of improved survival with therapy using an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (milirone) resulted in an opposite conclusion (excess death) in humans (14). In still another study, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (cilazapril) was ineffective in preventing restenosis following coronary angioplasty in humans, despite the efficacy of
