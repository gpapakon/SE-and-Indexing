<ABSTRACT>
An improved apparatus and method for welding battery jar 
covers (100) onto battery jars (98) with the battery elements and terminal 

posts in position in the jar (98) includes presser feet (90) for pressing the 
molten bead created between the battery jar (98) and the battery cover (100) 

during welding flat against the cover (100) and the jar (98) until the molten 
bead solidifies.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved apparatus and method 
for welding plastic battery jar covers onto plastic battery jars. US Patent No.4352977 (& EP-A-0144569) discloses an apparatus and 
method for welding battery covers onto battery jars by heating the periphery 
of the cover and the jar by heating means positioned therebetween, 
removing the heating means, and bringing the cover and jar together to 
effect a joint therebetween. While the apparatus and method disclosed in 
US Patent No.4352977 performs satisfactorily, it has been found that when a 
thermoplastic hot-plate weld is accomplished using said apparatus and 
method, the melting process causes molten material to form a bead on each 
side of the interface between the cover and the jar. Under present practices, the outer bead must be cut off or trimmed 
after the weld has been made and the plastic solidified so that the battery 
cell will fit into a steel container or tray with other battery cells. It is 
believed that the cutting or trimming process can open up small weld line 
imperfections which can result in microscopic leak paths which permit 
electrolytes (sulphuric acid) to escape the cell causing corrosion problems 
as well as contributing to the short-circuiting of the battery. JP-A-57036772 discloses apparatus for welding a battery cover onto a 
battery jar to prevent formation of an outer bead by bringing opposed heated 
surfaces of the battery cover and battery jar together in an outer frame 
body. The frame body surrounds the interface between the battery cover 
and battery jar without pressing against the interface. The invention as claimed is intended to remedy this drawback. It 
solves the problem of how to improve formation of a welded joint between 
plastic battery covers and plastic battery jars by the provision of means 
defined in the characterising part of Claim 1 for pressing against the 
interface between the jar and cover during the welding together of the jar 
and cover, i.e. during the welding process. The main advantage offered by the invention is that the molten bead 
formed at the interface between the cover and the jar is pressed flat against 
the cover and the jar interface until the molten bead solidifies thus 
eliminating a cutting or trimming step and its resulting problems. In this 
regard, it has been found that the dimensions of a finished welded assembly 
formed using the apparatus and method of the present invention are only 
0.04 to 0.07 cm (0.015 to 0.025 inches) greater than the original
