<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a packaging container, particularly for packaging, transporting, storing and stacking shoes, and to a method for its manufacture. The invention was based on the object of providing a packaging container which is simple and cost-effective to produce, is suitable as a reusable package, and requires only a small amount of space as an empty product, can be washed by machine and can be recycled in a cost-effective manner. As a solution, a packaging container is proposed, in which the bottom (13) of the receiving container (10) and the lid (9) consist of a flat or frame-like component (5, 8) of a stable, impact-resistant material. The sides (3) consist of a flexible material which can be folded together, the upper edge of the sides (3) being connected to a frame-like component (7) which acts in a reinforcing manner. On at least two mutually opposite sides (3), pivotable supporting elements (2) of a sturdy, rigid material are arranged on the frame-like component (7) connected to the upper edge of the sides (3). These supporting elements can be connected in a positive-locking manner to the frame-like component (7) and the bottom (13) in such a way that the sides (3) are tensioned and are secured against lateral displacement. The packaging container can be manufactured from a material, preferably polypropylene, by injection moulding.
