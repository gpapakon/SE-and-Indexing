<ABSTRACT>
A helical type tape recording and reproducing system records blocks of user data of predetermined size by reformating the user data blocks into physical blocks that are recorded on tape. Each physical block is recorded as a double frame on a set of successive helical tracks, preferably 32 tracks. Each double frame has system format data interleaved with the user data. The present invention is directed to system format data that includes a sequence number for each physical block and enables the system to determine during reproducing if any physical block has been lost. The system also includes a partition access bookkeeping feature that stores information relating to locations at which searching or recording has been performed during a current load of a tape in the system, which is useful in accomplishing efficient searching for user data recorded on the tape.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to mass storage devices, and more particularly, to
recording and reproducing apparatus and methods for achieving very high density recording of
digital information at very high transfer rates.The market for mass storage devices is growing at what seems to be an ever 
increasing rate with the sales of high-performance computers penetrating numerous industries
ranging from financial institutions to oil exploration companies. The processing power of these
high-performance systems, and the data they generate, are increasing faster than the ability of
storage devices to keep pace. The problem of data storage and rapid retrieval is particularly
pronounced in computational-intensive applications which create huge amounts of data that need to
be accessed in seconds rather than minutes, hours or even days.Magnetic disks remain the preferred media for direct access to frequently used files
because of their fast access times. However, because of their high cost per-unit of storage (such
as a megabyte) and their limited capacity, magnetic disk recorders are prohibitively expensive and
therefore impractical for large-scale data storage. With the advances in magnetic tape technology,
tape based systems remain the preferred choice for mass data storage. In addition to cost,
magnetic tape exceeds the storage density of any other medium, at least from a volumetric
standpoint, because tape is a much thinner medium than, for example, magnetic disks, and tape
can be tightly packed. A general discussion of such technology may be found in Mass Storage
Technologies, by S. Ranada, published in 1991 by Meckler Publishing.The tape format basically defines the recording path used to record signals on the
tape. There are many different recording formats developed for data recording and reproducing.
A commonly used format for high capacity systems is IBM's 3480 multi-track tape cartridge
format in which the tape transport employs a stationary head and records data along longitudinal
tracks. Since the late 1970's rotary head helical scan recorders, a technology developed originally
for video recorders, have been used for recording computer data (DDS and Data/DAT). In helical scan recorders, the tape is
transported past a rapidly rotating head along a helical path whereby data is recorded diagonally
across the tape. Compared to longitudinal recorders, helical scan recorders generate high
recording densities and lower tape speeds for a given data transfer rate.The present invention is directed to a

<CLAIMS>
A system adapted to selectively record and reproduce
digital information data on a magnetic tape, each magnetic

tape having a recordable volume, said volume being divided
into a plurality of partitions in which said information

data can be recorded, said system comprising:

recording and playback means adapted to selectively record
and reproduce information data including user data and

system format data in physical blocks (PB) of predetermined
size on helical tracks in a recording area of said tape;
servo means for controlling the movement of said tape in
first and second directions, said servo means moving said

tape in said first direction during normal recording and
reproducing, said servo means including means adapted to

selectively record and reproduce servo information on a
servo control track (SVT) that extends in the longitudinal

direction of said tape; and
processing means for generating said system format data and
for providing said user data and said system format data to

said recording and playback means for recording thereby on
said tape, said processing means generating a subarea matrix

of said system format data for recording-on at least one
predetermined helical track of each set of helical tracks,

said system format data including a sequence number (PBST)
for each physical block within a partition;

characterised in that said processing means is adapted to record and read
logical address data (FDBN) that identifies the first data

block or byte in a physical block and is furthermore adapted
to rewrite or overwrite a physical block whereby the new 

physical block includes logical address data that is the
same as the logical address data of the first data block or

byte that was recorded in a previous physical block within
said partition; and

said sequence number (PBST) selectively increases from a
predetermined minimum number to a predetermined maximum

number with each successive physical block, said sequence
number being set to said predetermined minimum number for

the successive physical block following the physical block
with said predetermined maximum number, said sequence number

being the same as the sequence number for the previous
physical block if it is a completely overwritten or

rewritten physical block.
A system as defined in claim 1 wherein said
predetermined minimum number is zero.
A system as defined in claim 1 wherein said
predetermined maximum number is 255.
A system as defined in claim 1 wherein said system
format data is recorded on each track of each set of tracks.
A system according to any foregoing claim wherein the
user data is recorded in identifiable data blocks and

processing means can cause the recording and playback means
to partially overwrite the user data beginning at any

specified data block and causes such overwriting to begin at
the next physical block after the one containing the

specified data block, the specified data block being the
first data block within the new physical data block.
