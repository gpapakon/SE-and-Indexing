<ABSTRACT>
The torque converter (12), gearbox (11) and heat exchanger (14) are all connected to a common control valve (16) which regulates the fluid flow for optimum cooling. In the start-up phase, with cold fluid, the control valve isolates the torque converter circuit and the gearbox circuit to ensure rapid warming of the fluid circuits in both systems. At high temperatures both fluid flows are ducted through the heat exchanger. The system provides for intermediate temperatures in which the return flow from the torque converter is split between the heat exchanger and returning to the input side of the torque converter, with the lost fluid made up with fluid from the gearbox circuit.

An arrangement to control the temperature of a hydraulic operating medium
for an automatic transmission (11) and a hydrodynamic torque converter (12)

with a converter feed line (13) for the operating medium in which a cooler (14)
for the heat emitted by the operating medium with a cooler return line leading to

the transmission (11) and a control valve (16 or 16a or 16b) which works in
dependence on the temperature of the operating medium is used and a converter

return line (17), a cooler forward line (18) leading to the cooler and a line (19)
which is connected directly to the transmission (11) are connected to the control

valve in such a manner that in a lower temperature phase covering temperatures
lower than a limit value the converter return line (17) is disconnected from the

cooler forward line (18) and the line (19) which is connected directly to the
transmission (11) is connected to a first ofthe lines connected to the control

valve, while in an upper temperature phase covering temperatures higher than
the limit value the converter return line (17) is connected to the cooler forward

line (18) and the line (19) which is connected directly to the transmission is
connected to a second of the lines connected to the control valve,
characterised in that

also connected to the control valve (16 or 16a or 16b) is the converter feed line
(13), that in the lower temperature phase (Fig. 3A) the converter return line

(17) is connected to the converter feed line (13) and the line (19) which is
directly connected to the transmission (11) is connected to the cooler forward

line (18), and that in the upper temperature phase (Fig. 3C) the converter feed
line (13) is connected to the line (19) which is connected directly to the

transmission (11).

temperature phase (Fig. 3B) covering the temperatures between the limit values
(T.G1 and T.G2) (100°C to 120°C), the converter return line (17) is connected

to both the converter feed line (13) and the cooler forward line (18) and the line
(19) which is connected directly to the transmission (11) is connected to both

the converter return line (13) and to the cooler forward line (18).
