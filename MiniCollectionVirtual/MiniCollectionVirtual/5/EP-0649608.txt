<ABSTRACT>
A brassiere (70) has a bodice portion (2) for encircling a 
wearer's torso. A pair of breast cups (10, 11) are loosely 

mounted on the bodice portion (2) to allow freedom of 
movement. Cut-out portions (7, 8) are provided at a front 

upper edge of the bodice (2) for close fitting of the upper 
edge of the bodice (2) under a wearer's breasts with a central 

tongue (9) between the cut-out portion (7, 8) extending 
upwardly between the breasts. Wire support elements are 

mounted in pockets (72) extending along an upper edge of each 
of the cut-out portions (7, 8). The support elements may be 

removable.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to improvements to clothing, and in
particular to brassieres and garments incorporating
brassieres.From GB-A-2 253 333 a brassiere is known which comprises a
bodice portion for encircling a wearer's torso and a pair of
breast cups loosely mounted on the bodice portion to
facilitate relative movement between the bodice portion and
the breast cups.The brassiere of the present invention
comprises a
torso encircling bodice and a pair of breast cups attached to
the bodice, wherein a front upper edge of the front portion of
the bodice has two cut-out portions for close fitting of the
upper edge of the front portion of the bodice under a wearers
breasts with a central tongue between the cut-out portions
extending upwardly between the breasts, and wherein each cup
is attached to the tongue adjacent a free end of the tongue
and at an outer side of a respective cut-out portion leaving
an opening between a lower edge of the cup and the front
portion of the bodice, wherein at least one
support element is mounted in the bodice section along an
upper edge of each of the cut-out portions. The support elements may be of metal, plastics or any other
suitable material.Conveniently, the support element is
mounted removable on the brassiere. Thus advantageously a user can
remove the support elements if desired. Also, from a
producer's point of view, two different sets of garments - one
with support elements, the other without - need not be
produced but rather a single range of garments with the option
of inserting support elements or not as desired.In a preferred embodiment, each removable support element is
mounted in a pocket having an opening for insertion and
removal of the removable wire support element.Ideally, a retractable flap is mounted across the opening to
retain the removable support element within the pocket.In another embodiment, a rear portion of the brassiere is
formed by a number of triangular panels of material. This 
advantageously minimises gathering of the material at the back
of the wearer which can cause built-up pressure at a certain
point in the area of the centre back waist causing discomfort
and spoiling the otherwise smooth line required in an
undergarment to enhance outer apparel. The triangular panels
allow the rear of the brassiere to more closely conform to the
contours of the back of the wearer for greater comfort.In a further embodiment, the girth of a brassiere is
adjustable, side or rear panels of the brassiere incorporating
a folded portion stitched in a folded
