<ABSTRACT>
A tape cassette (T₁,T₂) capable 
of refilling a tape (t₁,t₂) among 

various tapes each having width different from one another 
into a corresponding tape cassette, and capable of properly 

refilling the tape into a corresponding 
tape cassette (T₁,T₂) 

without fail. In a broad width tape cassette, a first 
annular space is provided between an inner diameter of a 

tape spool and an outer diameter of a tape support shaft. 
A first cap (30) is fitted into the first space. In a small 

width tape cassette, a second annular space is provided 
between an inner diameter of a tape spool and an outer 

diameter of a tape support shaft. A second cap (30A) is fitted 
into the second space. A tape spool can be correctly 

refilled into corresponding tape cassette by checking 
insertion of the caps (30,30A) into the spaces.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tape cassette 
installable in a tape printer, and more particularly, to 
the tape cassette in which a new tape roll can be repacked 
or refilled in a cassette case, and a a repacking of the 
tape roll in the cassette case can be performed without 
misleadingness of the tape kind. The tape printer can produce a character-printed tape 
to be affixed to a backbone of a video cassette, etc. 
Conventionally, in tape cassettes for use in the tape 
printer, a plurality of tapes each having width different 
from one another are required to meet with various use of 
character-printed tapes produced by the tape printer. To 
this effect, various kind of tape cassettes are prepared 
for installing, in each of the cassette cases, each tape 
of different width. In such conventional tape cassettes, 
repacking of a new tape in the cassette case has not been 
considered when the tape in the cassette case is used up. 
Therefore, when the tape is used up, the cassette case has 
a reduced value, and it is discarded. However, in the conventional tape cassette, even in 
a case where the tape in the cassette case is used up, the 
cassette case per se is still usable. Therefore, mere abandonment  
 
of the tape cassette for the reason of use-up of the 
tape is extremely wasteful, and the tape cassette becomes 
costly. Further, in light of recent trend of the protection 
of environment, a throw-away of the cassette case each 
time after the use-up of the tape may violate the protection 
of environment, since the cassette case is made of a 
resin material such as plastics. It is therefore, an object of the present invention 
to overcome the above described conventional drawbacks, and 
to provide a tape cassette capable of repacking a new tape 
roll into a cassette case, to thereby avoid any waste in 
making a character-printed tape, to thus reduce entire 
running cost. Another object of the invention is to provide a tape 
cassette in which repacking of the tape in the cassette 
case can be properly performed without misleadingness of 
the tape kind. In order to attain the above described object, according 
to a first aspect of the present invention, there 
are provided a plurality of different kind of tape cassettes, 
each tape cassettes comprising a tape spool, a 
cassette body and a tape support shaft. The tape spool 
winds thereover a tape, and is formed with a bore defining 
an inner contour characteristic. The cassette body is  
 
adapted for accommodating therein the tape spool and a roll

<CLAIMS>
A plurality of different kind of tape cassettes, each 
tape cassette comprising: 

a tape spool winding thereover a tape, the tape spool being 
formed with a bore defining an inner contour characteristic; 

a cassette body for accommodating therein the tape spool and a 
roll of the tape; 

a tape support shaft upstanding from the cassette body and 
having an outer contour characteristic, the tape spool being 

adapted for being rotatably disposed around the tape support 
shaft through the spool bore; 

the outer contour characteristic of the tape support shaft of 
each kind of tape cassette corresponding to the inner contour 

characteristic of the tape spool bore for the same type of tape 
cassette, so that a correspondence between the outer and inner 

contour characteristics provides a relation with respect to an 
identical kind, and the relation being different from that in 

the different kind of the tape cassette. 
The plurality of different kind of tape cassettes as 
claimed in claim 1, wherein the plurality of tape cassettes 

comprise at least a first tape cassette accommodatable therein 
a first kind tape, and a second tape cassette accommodatable 

therein a second kind tape, a width of the first kind tape 
being greater than that of the second kind tape, an inner diameter 

of the spool bore of the second tape cassette being made 
smaller than an outer diameter of the tape support shaft of the 

first tape cassette for preventing the tape spool of the second 
tape cassette from being accidentally disposed around the tape 

spool shaft of the first tape cassette. 
The plurality of different kind of tape cassettes as 
claimed in claim 1 or 2, further comprising a plurality of lid 

members each detachably provided to each of the cassette bodies. 
The plurality of different kind of tape cassettes as 
claimed in one of claims 1 to 3, wherein the plurality of tape 

cassettes comprise at least a first tape cassette accommodatable
