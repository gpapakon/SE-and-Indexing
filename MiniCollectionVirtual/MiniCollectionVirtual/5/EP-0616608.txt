A process for recovering substantially neutral, low-volatility organic 
compounds containing reactive olefinic double bonds in pure form from a 

starting material which contains these components together with small 
quantities of acidic reaction components and/or corresponding auxiliaries in 

the liquid phase by neutralization, removal of the salts formed and recovery 
of pure products which - even without distillation - combine low residual acid 

values with low colour values using solid, finely powdered oxides, carbonates 
and/or hydroxides of the alkali and/or alkaline earth metals (neutralizing 

agents) and subsequent removal of the organic liquid phase from the solid 
phase formed, characterized in that the neutralization step is carried out as 

follows: 

addition of the solid neutralizing agent to the hot starting material in an 
at least substantially stoichiometric quantity, based on the acid value 

of the starting material, 
simultaneous or subsequent addition of water in a quantity of 0.5 to 
15% by weight, based on the starting material, 
neutralization by mixing for at least a few minutes, 
removal of the water from the hot reaction product by distillation under 
reduced pressure and 
removal of the solid phase now present from the liquid. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the starting 
material is kept at a temperature from room temperature to 140°C during the 

steps mentioned above. 
A process as claimed in claims 1 and 2, characterized in that, where 
aerobic inhibitors are used, the starting material is aerated at least during the 

addition of the neutralizing agent and water and the subsequent neutralization 
step.  

 
A process as claimed in claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the quantity 
of neutralizing agent, based on the acid value of the starting material, is 

limited to at most 1.5 times the stoichiometrically necessary amount. 
A process as claimed in claims 1 to 4, characterized in that water is 
added in quantities of 2 to 10% by weight, based on the starting material, 

after or at the same time as the addition of the at least substantially dry 
neutralizing agent. 
A process as claimed in claims to 5, characterized in that the solid 
component is removed by pressure filtration. 
A process as claimed in claims 1 to 6, characterized in that neutralization 
is carried out with the oxides and/or hydroxides of calcium and/or 

magnesium, the at least partial use of corresponding calcium compounds 
being preferred. 
A process as claimed in claims 1 to 7, characterized in that the 
removal of the water from the hot reaction product by distillation is carried out 

at end pressures of 1 to 150 mbar. 
A process as claimed in claims 1 to 8, characterized in that at least 
substantially water-free, olefinically unsaturated starting materials susceptible 

to polymerization or gelation which contain residual acid from the condensation 
reaction, acidic catalysts, inhibitors with an acidic reaction and the like 

as acidic impurities are used. 
A process as claimed in claims 1 to 9, characterized in that low-volatility 
esters of polyhydric alcohols and olefinically unsaturated carboxylic 

acids are used as the starting materials. 
The use of the process claimed in claims 1 to 10 for inhibitor exchange, 
in which a radical inhibitor (production inhibitor) capable of forming 

salts with bases is exchanged for radical inhibitors or inhibitor systems 
(application inhibitor) which may be freely selected in regard to type and 

quantity. 
The use claimed in claim 11, characterized in that reactive starting  
 

materials containing phenolic and/or hydroquinone compounds, more 
especially α-substituted hydroquinones, as production inhibitors are 

subjected to the inhibitor exchange. 
The use claimed in claims 11 and 12, characterized in that the inhibitor 
exchange is carried out with mixtures containing dialkyl-substituted hydroquinones 

and, in particular, 2,5-di-tert.butyl hydroquinone as the production 
inhibitor. 
The use claimed in claims 11 to 13, characterized in that production 
inhibitors with limited physiological compatibility are exchanged for application 

inhibitors with better physiological compatibility, vitamin E in particular 
being used as the physiologically compatible application inhibitor.
