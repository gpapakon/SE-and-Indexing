<ABSTRACT>
An improved friction material may be made having reinforcing
fibers (32) aligned generally perpendicular to the friction surface (30) of said

material (28) by forming a paper (10) of fibrous friction materials (32) such
that the fibers in the paper are aligned closely to the longitudinal axis of the

paper and then folding or cutting the paper into pleats (18) or strips such that
the pleats (18) or strips are bonded together with the edges (20) defining the

friction surface (30) of the friction body (28) and the fibers (32) perpendicular
to that surface (30).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to methods of manufacturing friction
materials such as disk brake friction pads and the like. More specifically, this
invention pertains to a method of forming such a friction material from a
paper of oriented fibers that is cut or folded and stacked to form the friction
pad.A method of making a paper friction material is known for
example from EP-A-0 129 022. However, this friction material
is not formed by stacked paper layers.Conventionally manufactured friction materials are produced by
mechanically blending particulate friction-producing and lubricating additives,
short fibers and thermosetting resin materials and then molding the mass
under heat and pressure to form a finished brake pad or lining or the like.
During molding of the mixed material, pressure is applied perpendicular to
the broad face of the pad. This results in a high degree of fiber orientation
generally parallel to what is to be the wear surface of the pad. This procedure
and the resulting fiber orientation limits the friction and wear performance of
the final pad due to material restriction and the inability to orient fibers in the
optimal direction, which would often be perpendicular to the wear surface.One of the primary limitations of friction materials is their thermal
stability. On a conventional automotive disk brake pad, the wear surface
temperature can exceed 700°C. The wear rate of the surface materials
increases dramatically as the wear surface temperature rises above the
decomposition temperatures of the fibers and/or the binder that joins them
together. The fibrous constituents serve as both a reinforcement for the
friction material and a bearing surface to increase wear life. Thus, it is
desirable to incorporate fibers into the friction material with the 
decomposition temperature above 700°C. Such fibers include metallic,
carbon, graphite, glassy and ceramic fibers. Except for the metallic fibers, all
of these classes of potential friction material reinforcing fibers are intrinsically
brittle, and they fracture with a loss of reinforcing capability when subjected
to the mixing and molding pressures used to form friction materials by
conventional processes.Thus, conventional friction material processing does not allow the
exploitation of the most thermally-resistant fibers due to breakage of the fibers
and to their alignment in a least desirable orientation parallel to the wear
surface. When the fibers are in line with the contact of the wear surface, they
are readily pulled from the matrix
