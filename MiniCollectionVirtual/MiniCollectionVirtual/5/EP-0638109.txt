<ABSTRACT>
The tensile strength of a thermoplastic, transparent, aromatic polyester is markedly improved by incorporating into the polyester a thermoplastic, rigid polyurethane. The resultant transparent blend is particularly useful in making eyeglasses, toothbrushes, and screwdriver handles.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to synthetic polymeric resin compositions useful for
thermoplastic fabrication. More particularly, the present invention refers to thermoplastic
blends of polymers and other polymers that improve certain physical properties without
adversely affecting the transparency property of the polyester.The high molecular weight polyesters of terephthalic, isophthalic and other
aromatic diacids are well known. See, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 2,465,319 and 3,047,539.
These aromatic polyesters have many properties such as high heat distortion temperature,
stiffness and transparency which make them particularly suitable for use in containers,
electronic components and consumer products. However, for many potential applications such
as safety eyeglasses, the polyesters do not possess sufficient combination of tensile strength,
toughness and transparency to perform satisfactorily.Therefore, it is highly desirable to provide a means to improve the tensile
strength of the polyester without sacrificing its hardness, thermal resistance or transparency.According to the invention, this object is fulfilled by a polyester/polyurethane blend as defined in the claims.Surprisingly, the blends of the present invention exhibit excellent tensile strength
and a toughness, thermal resistance or hardness which is at least equal to such properties of the
polyester and a transparency which is comparable to the transparency of the polyester. As a
result of their unique combination of properties, these blends are useful in safety eyeglasses;
industrial components, such as sight glasses, protective covers; fuel handling systems;
consumer products including screwdriver handles, toothbrushes, and other applications
requiring transparency and heat resistance and tensile strength.The aromatic polyester employed in the practice of this invention is preferably
any thermoplastic, transparent polyester prepared by reacting an aromatic diacid such as
terephthalic acid or isophthalic acid with an alkylene diol such as ethylene glycol,
1,3-propanediol or 1,4-butanediol. Also suitable are the various copolyesters prepared from 
mixtures of aromatic diacids and/or mixtures of alkylene diols. The polyesters may be
essentially linear or branched as a result of using branching agents such as tri- and
tetracarboxylic acids. The polyesters may be capped with different diols such as cyclohexanedimethanol
and cyclohexanediol.In general, suitable polyesters and copolyesters can be prepared from one or
more multi-hydric compounds
