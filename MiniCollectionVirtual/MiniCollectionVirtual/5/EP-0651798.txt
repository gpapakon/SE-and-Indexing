<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to novel methods and compositions for blocking transmission of (Plasmodium spp.) which cause malaria. In particular, P28 proteins are disclosed which, when administered to a susceptible organism, induce an immune response against a 28 kD protein on the surface of (Plasmodium) ookinetes and block transmission of malaria.

<DESCRIPTION>
 TARGET ANTIGENS OF TRANSMISSION BLOCKING ANTIBODIESFOR MALARIA PARASITESBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Malaria continues to exact a heavy toll from mankind. Between 200 million to 400 million people are infected by Plasmodium falciparum , the deadliest of the malarial protozoans, each year. One to four million of these people die. Approximately 25 percent of all deaths of children in rural Africa between the ages of one and four years are caused by malaria. The life cycle of the malaria parasite is complex.Infection in man begins when young malarial parasites or "sporozoites" are injected into the bloodstream of a human by a mosquito. After injection the parasite localizes in liver cells. Approximately one week after injection, the parasites or "merozoites" are released into the bloodstream to begin the "erythrocytic" phase. Each parasite enters a red blood cell in order to grow and develop. When the merozoite matures in the red blood cell, it is known as a trophozoite and, when fully developed, as a schizont. A schizont is the stage when nuclear division occurs to form individual merozoites which are released to invade other red cells. After several schizogonic cycles, some parasites, instead of becoming schizonts through asexual reproduction, develop into large uninucleate parasites. These parasites undergo sexual deve1opment.Sexual development of the malaria parasites involves the female or "macrogametocyte" and the male parasite or "microgametocyte." These gametocytes do not undergo any further development in man. Upon ingestion of the gametocytes into the mosquito, the complicated sexual cycle begins in the midgut of the mosquito. The red blood cells disintegrate in the midgut of the mosquito after 10 to 20 minutes. The microgametocyte continues to develop through exflagellation and releases 8 highly flagellated microgametes. Fertilization 

occurs with the fusion of the microgamete and a macrogamete. The fertilized parasite, which is known as a zygote, then develops into an "ookinete." The ookinete penetrates the midgut wall of the mosquito and develops into an oocyst, within which many small sporozoites form. When the oocyst ruptures, the sporozoites migrate to the salivary gland of the mosquito via the hemolymph. Once in the saliva of the mosquito, the parasite can be injected into a host, repeating the life cycle. Malaria vaccines are needed against different stages in the parasite's life cycle, including the sporozoite, asexual erythrocyte, and sexual stages. Each vaccine against a particular
