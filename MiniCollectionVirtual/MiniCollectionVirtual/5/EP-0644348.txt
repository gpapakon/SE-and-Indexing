<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a floating metal structure (11) which can be used in most aircraft brakes. This structure is designed to better distribute the pressure applied by the cylinders (7). The structure (11) is a ring with a U-shaped section with a flat bottom (13) and top of the flared out sides, in the bottom of which ring are inserted freely all the cylinders (7) which, moreover, centre it. In a first solution, contact of the said structure (11) takes place directly between the bottom (13) of the U of this structure and the first disc. In a second solution, contact takes place via a number of bearing shims (18) equal in number to the total number of active and inactive cylinders (7) and arranged in a staggered configuration relative to them. These shims (18), which remain effective if the active and inactive cylinders (7) are alternated, act as if the number of cylinders had been doubled. Moreover, the structure (11) favours thermal protection of the cylinders.

<CLAIMS>
Aircraft brake, in which a floating metal structure (11) is interposed
between the ends of the brake jacks (7) and the disk (4) closest to the

jacks, said structure being intended to improve the pressure distribution
exerted on said disk and on the following disks, having a generally circular

shape coaxial to the disks and having, over its entire circumference, a
radial, U-shaped section (12) with a flat bottom, in which are introduced,

with an adequate clearance, and support the ends (17) of all the jacks (7),
the ends of the sides (12a, 12b) of the U (12) being extended towards the

outside of the U, so as to form two concentric rings (14, 15) with a profile
substantially parallel to the bottom (13) of the U (12).
Aircraft brake according to claim 1, wherein the ends of the piston (16)
of the jacks (7) are equipped with pads (17) coming into contact with the

bottom (13) of the structure (11).
Aircraft brake according to claim 2, wherein the pads (17) are shaped
like ring sectors.
Aircraft brake according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the
floating metal structure (11) is equipped with a heat exchanger constituted

by fins (21) fixed to the sides (12a, 12b) of the U (12) or to the concentric
rings (14, 15).
Aircraft brake according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the
floating metal structure (11) is provided, on a face (13) which is to bear

against the closest disk (4) of the jacks, with a number of shims (18)
identical to the total number of jacks (7), and angular marking means (19, 20)

between said structure and at least one of the jacks (7), so that the shims
(18) are halfway between the jacks.
Aircraft brake according to claim 5, wherein the thickness of the shims
(18) is dimensioned so that a direct contact is established, in the axis of

the active jacks, between the floating metal structure (11) and the closest
disk (4) of the jacks, as soon as the pressure of the jacks (7) reaches a 

value corresponding to a significant, i.e. rare braking, so as to protect the
structure against very high forces.
Aircraft brake according to either of the claims 5 and 6, wherein the
shims (18) are made from a relatively insulating and refractory material such

as a slightly conductive ceramic or low density sintered material, porous
sintered metal, etc.
