<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a power capacitor consisting of at least one capacitive element obtained by coiling at least two metallised plastic films with a rough surface. The metallised plastic films exhibit loophole patterns (6) formed by local demetallisations defining metallised surfaces (5) intended to isolate the defects which appear on the film during the lifetime of the capacitor. According to the invention, the metallised surfaces (5) are substantially equal to the surfaces of the defects to be isolated.
