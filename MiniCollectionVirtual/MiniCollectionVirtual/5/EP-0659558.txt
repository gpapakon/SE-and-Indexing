<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink detecting
device useful for a printing apparatus such as a
mimeograph apparatus and so forth, and more particularly
to a motor-type ink sensor for detecting the presence or
absence of ink by the driving condition of a motor which
drives to rotate an agitating part in ink.As a means for detecting ink in a printing apparatus
and so forth, an electrical capacitance ink detecting
device as shown in Fig. 12
is described in Japanese unexamined patent application
558-62520.
In this ink
detecting device, a ink roller and a squeegee roller
and an ink detecting electrode which contacts an
ink fountain defined therebetween serve as counter
electrodes to constitute a capacitor. This capacitor and
a coil not illustrated form an oscillatory circuit.The oscillation frequency of the oscillatory circuit
is determined by the capacity of the capacitor when
coil inductance is fixed. And the electrostatic capacity
of the capacitor is determined by the quantity of ink.
Therefore, the quantity of ink supplied between these
rollers corresponds to the oscillation frequency of the
oscillatory circuit, and the quantity of ink can be 
detected by use of this oscillation frequency.According to the ink detecting device of
electrostatic capacity type described above, it is
imperative to accurately set the location of the
detecting electrode in relation to the rollers
and in order to perform accurate ink detection. If
the detecting electrode is not accurately set, there
will occur such a problem as inaccurate ink detection.
Since there exists a limited space for mounting the
detecting electrode within a narrow printing drum of the
printing apparatus, the setting of the ink detecting
device is much restricted. US-A-3,747,084 describes a liquid level gauge for
supervising the level of a liquid such as the level in an
ink receptacle of a printing press. It comprises a probe
which is driven to perform repetitive, pendulum, uniform
motions and so arranged that it dips into the ink when the
level thereof exceeds a predetermined height. Dipping of
the probe into the ink and the resulting increased
resistance thus experienced by the probe cause the probe to
vary the repeat pattern of its motions. This variation is
utilized via switch means controlled by the probe motions
to produce an electrical pulse pattern used to stop the
feeding of ink into the receptacle thereby effectively
preventing over-filling of the ink receptacle.When the liquid level in the receptacle reaches a
height causing braking of the

<CLAIMS>
An ink sensor for detecting ink in a printing
means of a printing apparatus (1), said ink sensor

comprising:

an agitating part (22) disposed in the position of
an ink fountain (50) formed in said printing means, a motor (21)

for turning said agitating part (22), and a control section (24)
for detecting ink from the driving condition of said

motor (21), and
wherein said control section(24) judges the quantity of ink

by detecting the driving condition of said motor (21) from the
load current of said motor (21) which is driven at a rated or

lower voltage.
An ink sensor according to claim 1,
wherein said control section (24) outputs an "Empty" signal when

it has judged that the ink quantity is under a reference
value, thereby driving an ink supply section.
An ink sensor according to claim 2,
wherein said control section (24) outputs said "Empty" signal,

and drives said ink supply section only when an "Enable"
signal outputted only when the supply of ink is required

is inputted into said control section (24). 
An ink sensor according to claim 1,
further comprising a restart signal generating circuit (6)

for supplying to said motor (21) a restart signal (SG1) for
restarting said motor (21) from a stop.
An ink sensor according to claim 4,
wherein said restart signal generating circuit (6) gives said

motor (21) a stronger restart signal (SG2) than said restart signal (SG1)
when said motor (21) fails restarting even after supplying a

predetermined number of restart signals.
An ink sensor according to claim 5,
wherein said restart signal generating circuit (6) gives said

motor a stronger restart signal (SG3) when said motor (21) fails
restarting.
