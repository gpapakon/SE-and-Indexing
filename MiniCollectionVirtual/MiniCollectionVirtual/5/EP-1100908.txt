<DESCRIPTION>
 HUMAN RECEPTOR-ASSOCIATED PROTEINSTECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates to nucleic acid and amino acid sequences of human receptor- associated proteins and to the use of these sequences in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of cell proliferative, autoimmune/inflammatory, reproductive, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal disorders.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe term receptor describes proteins that specifically recognize other molecules. The category is broad and includes proteins with a variety of functions. The bulk of the proteins termed receptors are cell surface proteins which, when they bind extracellular ligands, produce cellular responses in the areas of growth, differentiation, endocytosis, and immune response. Other receptors facilitate the specific transport of proteins out of the endoplasmic reticulum and localize enzymes to a particular compartment of the cell. The term may also be applied to proteins which act as receptors for ligands (with known or unknown chemical composition) which interact with other cellular components. For example, the steroid hormone receptors bind to and regulate transcription of genomic DNA. Regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration is important for the formation and function of tissues. Secreted regulatory proteins such as growth factors coordinately control these cellular processes and act as mediators in cell-cell signaling pathways. Growth factors are secreted from the cell, and bind to specific cell-surface receptors on target cells. The bound receptors trigger intracellular signal transduction pathways which activate various downstream effectors. Such processes regulate many cell functions including cell proliferation, differentiation, gene transcription, cell motility, and oncogenic transformation.Cell surface receptors are typically integral membrane proteins of the plasma membrane. These receptors recognize hormones including the catecholamines, such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, and histamine; peptide hormones such as glucagon, insulin, gastrin, secretin, cholecystokinin, adrenocorticotropic hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, thyroid stimulating hormone, parathyroid hormone, and vasopressin; growth and differentiation factors such as epidermal growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, transforming growth factor, insulin-like growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, nerve growth factor, colony-stimulating factors, and erythropoietin; cytokines such as chemokines, interleukins, interferons, and

7. A method for detecting a polynucleotide, the method comprising the steps of:
(a) hybridizing the polynucleotide of claim 6 to at least one nucleic acid in a sample, thereby forming a hybridization complex; and
(b) detecting the hybridization complex, wherein the presence of the hybridization complex correlates with the presence of the polynucleotide in the sample.
8. The method of claim 7 further comprising amplifying the polynucleotide prior to hybridization.
9. An isolated and purified polynucleotide comprising a polynucleotide sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 17-32 and fragments thereof. 10. An isolated and purified polynucleotide variant having at least 90% polynucleotide sequence identity to the polynucleotide of claim 9.
11. An isolated and purified polynucleotide having a sequence which is complementary to the polynucleotide of claim 9.
12. An expression vector comprising at least a fragment of the polynucleotide of claim 3.
13. A host cell comprising the expression vector of claim 12.
14. A method for producing a polypeptide, the method comprising the steps of: a) culturing the host cell of claim 13 under conditions suitable for the expression of the polypeptide; and 


 b) recovering the polypeptide from the host cell culture.
15. A pharmaceutical composition comprising the polypeptide of claim 1 in conjunction with a suitable pharmaceutical carrier.
