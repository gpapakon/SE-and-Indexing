Suspension system, in particular for the wheels of motor vehicles, with at least one 
hydraulic spring strut (2/4) which consists of a cylinder (6) and a piston (8) guided 

inside the cylinder in a movable fashion in order to facilitate the compression and 
expansion movement of the strut, whereby at least a portion of the hydraulic medium 

is displaced in particular into a hydropneumatic spring reservoir (16/18) during the 
compression movement of the spring strut (2/4), and said hydraulic medium flows 

back into the spring strut during the expansion movement; whereby at least the 
expansion flow of the spring strut (2/4) is conveyed through a flow path (26) of a 

damping valve (22/24) and damped due to the fact that the flow path (26) is 
continuously closed and re-opened in an alternating fashion by means of a valve 

element (30) once the expansion flow is present,
 
characterized by a bypass (40) which bypasses the valve element (30) of the damping 

valve (22/24) and is constructed such that a pressure compensation between sections 
of the flow path (26) arranged on both sides of the valve element (30) is ensured by 

means of the bypass (40) in a static condition in which essentially no flow is present 
and that the bypass (40) essentially loses this pressure compensation function in a 

dynamic condition once a flow is present. 
Suspension system according to Claim 1,
 
characterized in that the bypass (40) has a flow cross-section which is reduced such 

that it is substantially closed in regard to its pressure compensation function due to 
a high flow resistance once a flow is present, whereby the bypass (40) is in particular 

constructed as a through channel (42) extending through the valve element (30). 
Suspension system according to Claim 1 or Claim 2,
 
characterized in that the valve element (30) co-operates with a valve seat (32) in the

the valve element (30) is acted upon in its opening direction by the hydraulic pressure 

(p
s1
/p
s2

force (F
F
) in such a way that the valve element (30) automatically closes and opens 
the flow path (26) during an expansion flow, due to the fact that the valve element

exists between the two hydraulic pressures (p
s1
,p
h1
/p
s2
,p
h2
); and that said valve element
