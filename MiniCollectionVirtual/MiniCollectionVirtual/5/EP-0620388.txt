<ABSTRACT>
An X-Y shifting mechanism (25) is disclosed for controlling the shifting of a shift 
rail (17) in a first (Y-Y) transverse direction. The mechanism includes a shift finger 

assembly (39) including a shift finger (23). A lever member (57) is pivotable about 
the axis (A) of rotation. When the lever member (57) is pivoted, the movement is 

transmitted through a spring (91) to rotate a spring seat member (73), thus causing 
pivotal movement of the shift finger (23). During a non-synchronous engagement, 

kick-out movement causes pivotal movement of the shift finger in the opposite 
direction, compressing the spring (91) rather than damaging the shifting mechanism. 

The disclosed mechanism also enables preselection of neutral, compressing the 
appropriate one of the springs (91), such that the preloaded spring will move the shift 

finger and shift rail to the neutral position as soon as a torque break occurs.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a shifting mechanism of the "X-Y" type for 
use with a shift bar housing assembly of a mechanical change-gear transmission, 
and more particularly, to such a mechanism of the type which is automatically or 
semi-automatically shifted, on a transmission which otherwise would be manually 
shifted. Shift bar housing assemblies for mechanical change-gear transmissions 
usually comprise a plurality of generally parallel, independently transversely 
movable shift bars, which are to be selected, and moved transversely, to effect 
engagement/disengagement of a particular gear ratio. Such shift-bar housing 
assemblies are well known to those skilled in the art, as may be seen by 
reference U.S. Patent Nos. 2,951,392; 4,567,785; and 4,873,881, all of which 
are assigned to the assignee of the present invention and incorporated herein by 
reference. Typically, such shift bar housings have been manually controlled, and 
operated by a shift finger fixed to a directly mounted shift lever, or to the cross-shaft 
of a remotely controlled shifting mechanism. Automatic and semi-automatic 
mechanical transmissions, based upon generally standard mechanical 
transmissions, but provided with electric or pneumatic actuators, are now well 
known in the prior art, as may be seen by reference to U.S. Patent Nos. 
4,361,060 and 4,648,290, the latter of which is assigned to the assignee of the 
present invention, and both are incorporated herein by reference. Also now well known in the prior art are automatically controlled "X-Y" type 
shifting mechanisms, wherein a shift finger is automatically moved in the axial 
(X-X) or rail selection direction, and then in the transverse (Y-Y) or gear 
engagement/disengagement direction. It will be understood by those skilled in 
the art that reference herein to the "transverse" and "axial" directions pertains to 
the shifter, and do not necessarily imply any particular direction on either the  
 
transmission or the vehicle. Also known are single shaft shifting mechanisms, as 
may be seen by reference to U.S. Patent No. 4,920,815, which is assigned to the 
assignee of the present invention, and the disclosure of which is incorporated 
herein by reference. Frequently, such an automatic or semi-automatic X-Y shifting mechanism is 
applied to a non-synchronous mechanical change-gear transmission. As used 
herein, the term "non-synchronous" will be understood to refer to a mechanical 
change-gear transmission of the type not equipped with synchronizers (or with

A shifting mechanism (25) for controlling the shifting of change-gears of a 
mechanical change-gear transmission of the type having at least one shift rail 

(11) movable in a first (Y-Y) transverse direction from a gear-disengaged position 
(FIG. 2) to a gear-engaged position; said shifting mechanism (25) comprising a 

housing (27) and shaft means (37) disposed within said housing and supported 
therein, said shaft means defining an axis (A) of rotation; a shift finger assembly 

(39) including a shift finger (23) and being operatively associated with said shaft 
means and pivotable about said axis (A) of rotation to move said finger (23) in 

said first (Y-Y) transverse direction; input means (49,51) including a lever 
member (57) pivotable about said axis (A) of rotation to cause said pivotal 

movement of said shaft means (37) and said shift finger (23); characterized by:

a spring seat (95); 
(b) spring means (91) including a first end (89) seated against said spring seat 
(95), and a second end (85) operably associated with the other of said

movement of said lever member (57) in a first (clockwise) rotational 

direction about said axis (A) of rotation is transmitted through said spring
