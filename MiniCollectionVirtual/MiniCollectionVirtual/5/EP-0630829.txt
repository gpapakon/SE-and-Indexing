<ABSTRACT>
A reusable transport container for rolls of coiled, tape-like material consists of     - a rectangular container bottom (1) with vertical walls (2),   - a closable container lid (3) linked to one wall (2), - and at least one vertical guide column (4) attached to the container bottom (1), having a horizontal load plate (5) which can be displaced vertically along said guide column for receiving a stack of rolls, and having a compression spring (6) which is arranged between the container bottom (1) and the load plate (5) and can be stressed and relieved as a function of the load and by means of which the respective top roll (7) of the stack of rolls is raised to a working height a which lies above the upper end of the guide column (4) and above the front wall of the reusable transport container, each guide column (4) being assigned a counterpiece (8) which is attached in the container lid (3), engages in a positive-locking manner on the upper end of the guide column (4) when the container is closed and, together with said column, forms a unit between the container bottom (1) and the container lid (3), which unit stabilises the container and secures the stack of rolls resting on the load plate (5) against lateral movement.

A returnable container for rolls of wound, strip-like 
material, comprising 


a rectangular container base (1) with vertical 
walls (2), 
a container lid (3) which is closable and is 
articulatedly connected to a wall (2) 
and at least one vertical guide column (4) 
secured to the container base (1) with a 

horizontal load plate (5), which is vertically 
displaceable along the guide column (4) and is 

used for accommodating a roll stack, and with a 
compression spring (6), which is arranged between 

the container base (1) and the load plate (5), 
can be stressed and released as a function of the 

load and raises the respective uppermost roll (7) 
of the roll stack to a working height (a) which 

lies above the upper end of the guide column (4) 
and above the front wall of the returnable 

container so that the uppermost roll (7) can be 
removed without restriction above the container 

edge, a counter element (8) secured in the 
container lid (3) being associated with each 

guide column (4) and acting in a positive-locking 
manner upon the upper end of the
 guide column (4) 
when the container is closed and forming, 

together with the guide column (4), a unit 
between the container base (1) and container lid 

(3) which stabilises the container and secures 
the roll stack resting upon the load plate (5) 

against lateral movement. 
A returnable container according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the counter element (8) is 

conical at its end and engages in a conical recess (9)  
 

in the upper end of the guide column (4) when the 
container is closed. 
A returnable container according to one of claims 1 
and 2, characterised in that, in its base, the counter 

element (8) comprises a conical enlarged section (10), 
which engages in locking fashion in the upper central 

opening of the uppermost roll (7). 
A returnable container according to one of claims 1 
to 3, characterised in that a spring element (11) is 

associated with the counter element (8) and rests 
against the upper surface of the uppermost roll (7) 

when the container is closed. 
A returnable container according to one of claims 1 
to 4, characterised in that it comprises a 

circumferential edge recess with an embedded elastic 
sealing compound at the upper edge of the vertical 

walls (2), which edge recess cooperates with a 
corresponding circumferential edge recess with a 

similarly embedded elastic sealing compound in the 
container lid (3) to form a light proof labyrinth seal 

(12, 13, 14, 15). 
A returnable container according to one of claims 1 
to 5, characterised in that it is stackable as a 

result of a support foot formation (16) at the corners 
of the container base (1) and a corresponding lid 

corner formation (17) at the corners of the container 
lid (3).
