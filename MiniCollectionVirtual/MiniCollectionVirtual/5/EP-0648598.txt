<ABSTRACT>
In the process for the production of mouldings (2) from laminate, which is formed from paper or cardboard layers lying one on top of another and bonded (glued) to one another, a paper web, after the application of glue, is wound to form a hollow moulding (2), the hollow moulding (2) is subsequently compression-moulded and hardened.   The moulding (2) can be stored intermediately or immediately further processed. The moulding (2), which has been stored intermediately or is to be further processed immediately, is re-softened and the softened moulding (2) is subsequently compressed into its final form and hardened.
