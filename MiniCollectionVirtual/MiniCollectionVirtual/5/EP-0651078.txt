<ABSTRACT>
The spinning apparatus comprises two centrifugal spinning cans (7, 8) fed alternately by two conduits (5, 5'; 6, 6') connecting a drawframe to these spinning cans (7, 8) and commencing at a junction located at the exit of a common conduit (3). Each conduit (5, 6) comprises a set of nozzles (22, 23) intended for generating a helical flow. Two storage bobbins (9, 10) are arranged between the two parts of the conduits (5, 5'; 6, 6') in order to receive the spun thread in the cans (7, 8). Two pneumatically actuated pushers (11, 12) are intended for nipping the thread against the storage bobbins and at the same time interrupting the increase in the twist in the thread. Since, simultaneously with the actuation of one of the pushers (11, 12), the set of nozzles (22, 23) arranged in the conduit (5, 6) which is to receive the thread generates a helical air flow in this conduit at the moment when the spinning can is changed, the thread is sucked into this conduit. Because it no longer receives any twist after the nipping of the thread, the force thus exerted makes it possible to separate it and to direct the bundle of fibres (4) into the new conduit where it receives a twist. Another injector (20) is arranged at the exit of the drawframe (1, 2) in order to impart the sufficient cohesion of the fibres making it possible to maintain uniformity and is actuated with a predetermined delay in relation to the nozzles (22, 23) in order to assist the release of the thread and the change of conduit.

Process for centrifugal spinning designed to
continuously produce a yarn having an indefinite length

according to which two centrifugal spinning cans (7, 8) are
alternatively fed through two respective feeding conduits

(5, 5', 6, 6') both starting from the exit of a roller draft
device (1, 2), periodically separating the yarn at a

junction of the two conduits imparting a pre-twisting to the
bundle of fibres which exits through the roller draft device

by an helical air jet and directing one yarn end to the
other of said conduits, the yarn of each spinning can being

transferred on a storage bobbin (9, 10) by an actuated
pusher (11, 12) which nips that yarn along its path between

said junction and the can and applies it against said
storage bobbin at the precise moment when the yarn is

separated, characterized in that for periodically separating
the yarn while nipping the yarn a suction is simultaneously

produced in the other of said conduits (5, 6) creating a
helical air flow in the direction of the spinning can (7,

8) which the yarn must be fed into, so that the portion of
the yarn located at the junction of the two conduits,

isolated from the twisting source due to the nipping of the
yarn loses its cohesion and is taken apart from the rest of

the yarn under the effect of the suction produced in the
other of said conduits, within which the helical air flow

causing it to advance in the direction of the other spinning
can by submitting it to a pre-twisting, stopping said

helical flow once the yarn comes into contact with the
internal face of the centrifugal spinning can and the

operation is repeated in the opposite direction, an so on
as many times as it is wished.
Device for centrifugal spinning comprising two
centrifugal spinning cans (7, 8) alternatively fed by a

roller draft device (1, 2), two conduits (5, 5', 6, 6')
ending each to one of the said cans (7, 8) and starting from

a junction where the conduits branch from, said junction
being located at the exit of a common duct (3) having an

inlet adjacent to the exit of the roller draft device (1, 
2), means (22, 23) adjacent to said conduits to divide the

yarn into two and to lead it within the other of said two
conduits, each of said conduits comprising two aligned

portions (5, 5', 6, 6') separated by a gap, where at one
side of the yarn path a bobbin (9, 10) receives the yarn

produced within the spinning can to which said conduit ends
and at the other side of said yarn path a pusher (11, 12)

is driven by a pneumatic means (15, 16) for nipping the yarn
against the surface of said bobbin, characterized in that

said means adjacent to said conduits to divide the yarn
comprise pneumatic means (22, 23) such as nozzles to produce

in a substantial way simultaneously to said pusher (11, 12)
driving, an helical air flow in a part of the conduit (5,

6) extending between said junction and said gap leading to
the other spinning can.
Process according to claim 1, characterized in
that, simultaneously to the production of said helical air

flow in the other of said conduits, an air jet (25, 26) is
directed against the yarn upstream said conduit and in the

direction thereof.
Process, according to the claim 1, characterized
in that, at each of the interventions of one or the other

means (22, 23) to produce said helical air flow, a nozzle
(20) arranged in the duct (3) at the roller draft device

exit is driven and acts with a predetermined delay with
respect to the former ones.
Process, according to claim 4, characterized in
that, at the exit of the roller draft device (1, 2) an

helical twist is imparted by means of the nozzle (20) and
therefore at the two following nozzles (22, 23) of conduits

(5, 6) twisting is carried out in the same direction as the
one imposed by the centrifugal spinning can.
