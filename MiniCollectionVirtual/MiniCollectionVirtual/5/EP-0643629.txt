<ABSTRACT>
The present invention directed to a plug (16) for sealing a centrifuge tube (10). The plug (16) of the present invention is shaped and sized to provide an interference fit between the plug (16) and the tube stem (12) of the centrifuge tube. In the described embodiment, the plug is configured with a tapered body narrowing to a flared end (22). To facilitate the insertion and removal of the plug with moderate force, without compromising the restraining capability of the interference fit, the area of interference contact between the flared end and the filler stem is strategically reduced. An o-ring is provided in an annular groove (20) around the tapered body. The flared end (22) creates an interference fit with a tapered filler stem (12) whereby the plug (16) is secured in the filler stem (12) with a snapping action when the flared end (22) of the plug (16) extends into the tube beyond the tapered filler stem (12). In this snap-in position, the plug (16) is secured in the filler stem (12), providing an initial seal; such seal increases upon centrifugation by a self-sealing mechanism, either attributed to the internal hydrostatic pressure in the tube and/or the force of a support spacer on the plug. After centrifugation, the snap coupling between the filler stem and the plug securely retains the plug against any residual internal pressure built up within the tube created by deformation of the centrifuge tube either from centrifugation or through handling of the tube by the user.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to centrifuge 
tubes and, more particularly, to the sealing or closing 
of centrifuge tubes. Typical centrifuge tubes have a generally 
cylindrical body with one end having an filler opening or 
tube stem to receive the fluid sample to be subject to 
centrifugation. After the introduction of the fluid 
sample into the tube, it is necessary to provide a very 
tight closure or capping means over the open-end of the 
tube in order to prevent leakage of the contents during 
centrifugation. A continual problem with the placement of 
capping means on the open-ended centrifuge tubes is 
ensuring that a proper seal is being achieved between the 
plug and the tube to prevent any possible or potential 
leakage which could occur under hydrostatic pressure 
build up within the tube. Hydrostatic pressure within 
the tube becomes extremely strong when the centrifuge is 
rotated at speeds of 20,000 rpm or greater. The significance of eliminating or preventing 
any potential leakage in a high speed centrifuge cannot 
be under estimated. The fluid sample may contain some 
type of pathogen, mutagen, bacteria or other hazardous 
material. Leakage during the centrifugation run can 
create a hazardous condition for the operator. The 
sample may be a small supply of material which cannot be  
 
replaced, which the user does not wish to lose through 
leakage during the centrifugation run. Further, leakage 
will cause rotor imbalance and result in rotor mishap. In many instances, the resulting leakage is 
caused by an improper seal being achieved between the 
capping means and the centrifuge tube because of either a 
poor configuration or design of the capping means, or as 
a result of the improper placement of the capping means 
on the centrifuge tube. Not only is it important that 
the capping means be designed to achieve a secure seal 
between the test tube and the capping means, but also it 
is important that the capping means have such a design 
that it is easy to remove after the centrifuge run 
without having to disturb the contents of the fluid 
sample after the centrifugation. Otherwise, the 
separated sample constituents may be remixed and 
invalidate the centrifugation run. U.S. Patent No. 5,127,895, which shows the features of the preamble 
of claim 1, discloses a self-sealing 
centrifuge tube which makes use of the 
hydrostatic pressure of the sample solution contained in 
the tube to engage a tight seal during centrifugation.
