<ABSTRACT>
A package (1; 101) is conveyed to a test station where a friction roller (3'; 101) is pressed against it and urged to rotate relative to it. The amount of rotation urgeable for a preset torque is indicative of package seal quality. It is automatically detected and compared with a preset value or range.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a machine and method that 
may be used for applying a non-destructive test to a 
package such as a vacuum package, containing, for 
example, food, chemicals or medicines. This may be to 
check that the sealing of the package is good, e.g. so 
that the product within the package cannot escape from 
the package; nor can the outside atmosphere enter the 
package. It is particularly applicable to packages having 
flexible outer layers of plastics films. A machine of such type is useful, for example, in 
production lines, where it would be desirable to verify 
the integrity of the seals of the complete production 
throughput without destroying the packages or products. According to the invention there is provided a 
apparatus for testing packages comprising: 
a test station having support means for 
supporting a package; a test probe arranged to be relatively 
reciprocable towards and away from the support means; 
said probe having a surface portion which 
is transversely displaceable; first urging means for urging relative movement 
of the probe towards the support means to 
contact with its displaceable surface portion a 
package supported at said test station;  
 second urging means to urge said transverse displacement of 
said probe surface portion; and means for detecting transverse displacement of the 
probe surface portion and providing a corresponding 
output signal; whereby the probe is urgeable by 
said first urging means to contact a package at 
the test station with its surface portion, whereupon 
the ability of the second urging means to displace 
the probe surface portion is dependent on the nature of 
the contacted package so that the output signal of 
the detecting means is indicative of package quality.  The apparatus may test a stationary package. 
Dynamic testing is also possible, with packages moving 
continuously through one or more test stations. In another aspect the invention provides a method of 
testing a package comprising applying a test probe to the 
package; urging transverse displacement of a 
surface portion of the probe relative to the package 
while restraining displacement of the package in response 
thereto; and determining the amount of displacement of 
the probe surface portion transverse to the package and providing a 
corresponding output signal indicative of package 
quality. The force and/or torque applied by the probe may be 
variable. In order that the invention may be more clearly  
 
understood some embodiments will now be described with

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for testing packages comprising: 

a test station having support means (4) for 
supporting a package (1); 
a test probe (3,31) arranged to be relatively 
reciprocable towards and away from the support means (4); 

said probe having a surface portion (3') which 
is transversely displaceable; 
first urging means (5) for urging relative movement 
of the probe (3,3') towards the support means (4) to 

contact with its displaceable surface portion (3') a 
package (1) supported at said test station; 
second urging means (6) to urge said transverse displacement of 
said probe surface portion (31); and 
means (7) for detecting transverse displacement of the 
probe surface portion (3') and providing a corresponding 

output signal; whereby the probe (3,3') is urgeable by 
said first urging means (5) to contact a package (1) at 

the test station with its surface portion (3'), whereupon 
the ability of the second urging means (6) to displace 

the probe surface portion is dependent on the nature of 
the contacted package (1), so that the output signal of 

the detecting means (7) is indicative of package quality. 
Apparatus according to claim 1 wherein said 
test probe surface portion is provided by a rotary 

element(3').  
 
Apparatus according to any preceding claim 
wherein the support means (4) and the probe surface 

portion (3') have grip surfaces adapted to engage a 
package with high friction. 
Apparatus according to any preceding claim 
including conveyor means (4) for conveying packages (1) 

to and from the test station. 
Apparatus according to claim 4 wherein the 
conveyor means has a displaceable support surface which 

also provides said support means. 
Apparatus according to claim 4 or 5 arranged to 
test a package (101) while it is being conveyed by the 

conveyor means (104). 
Apparatus according to any preceding claim 
including computer means (10) arranged to receive the 

output signal of the detecting means (7) and compare it 
with a preset valve or range. 
Apparatus according to claim 7 further having 
package rejecting means (12) arranged to be actuable by 

said computer means (10) in response to a comparison. 
Apparatus according to any preceding claim 
having a plurality of test stations (112,133), each 

having a respective associated test probe (132) first 
(122) and second (126) urging means, and displacement 

detecting means (128). 
Apparatus according to any preceding claim  
 

wherein the first urging means (5;122) is adjustable to 
allow for different package thickness. 
A method of testing a package comprising 
applying a test probe to the package; urging transverse 

displacement of surface portion of the probe 
relative to the package while restraining displacement of 

the package in response thereto; and determining the 
amount of displacement of the probe surface portion transverse to 

the package and providing a corresponding output signal 
indicative of package quality. 
A method according to claim 11 which employs 
apparatus according to any of claims 1 to 10.
