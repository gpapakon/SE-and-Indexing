<ABSTRACT>
A boardlock is provided for holding down the housing of an electrical connector to a circuit board, which can be constructed at low cost and which assures good electrical and mechanical connection between the connector housing and circuit board. The boardlock is designed to be pushed downwardly through a cylindrical hole in a connector flange and through a larger diameter cylindrical hole drilled into the circuit board. The boardlock is formed from a piece of sheet metal which is bent to form largely tubular upper and lower portions (40, 42) received respectively in the flange hole in the large diameter board hole, with largely vertical edges of the bent sheet metal engaging the walls of the hole. The boardlock has a pair of horizontal separation slots (76, 78) extending a limited distance from each vertical edge to separate the upper and lower portions, to allow the edge regions (86, 88) of the lower tubular portion to be bent to a larger radius of curvature to engage the walls of the larger circuit board hole. A vertical middle portion (62) of the boardlock has a projecting bump (60) on the lower tubular portion to center the lower tubular portion in the circuit board hole. The lower tubular portion forms a pair of fingers (56, 58) that lie within the top of the circuit board hole, and which press against the lower surface of the housing flange. The tapered bottom portions of the boardlock have slits forming ramps to which solder adheres, so any pullout forces cause compression of some of the solder.

<DESCRIPTION>
One type of electrical connector has a housing 
designed to mount directly against the upper surface of a 
circuit board, with the connector contacts having 
termination ends engaged with conductive traces on the 
circuit board. The connector housing can be held to the 
circuit board by a pair of boardlocks that pass through 
holes in a pair of housing flanges and through corresponding 
holes that have been drilled into the circuit board. In 
most cases, the circuit board holes have been plated, with 
some of the plating coating the walls of the hole and 
additional portions lying on upper and lower faces of the 
board around the hole, to establish the board hole and 
connector housing at ground potential. With the boardlocks 
installed, the electrical connections between the connector 
and board may be soldered as by wave soldering. Each 
boardlock preferably has portions that abut both the upper 
and lower portions of the flange to lock securely to the 
connector during handling and shipment to the customer who 
will assemble it to the circuit board. Each boardlock also 
preferably makes firm contact with plated walls of the 
circuit board hole at several locations. In addition, the 
boardlock should offer high resistance to pullout from the 
circuit board in the final assembly. A boardlock which 
could be constructed at low cost and which provided the 
above features, would be of considerable value. In accordance with one embodiment of the present 
invention, a low cost boardlock is provided which can be 
inserted through holes in a connector flange and in a 
circuit board to securely hold the connector and board 
together while assuring good electrical connection between 
them. The boardlock is designed to fit through a connector  
 
flange hole of a first diameter and a board hole of a second 
larger diameter. The boardlock is formed from a piece of 
sheet metal that is bent around a vertical axis to form 
largely tubular upper and lower hole-received portions that 
are received respectively in the flange hole and the larger 
board hole. A pair of horizontal separator slots extend 
from each edge of the sheet metal partially around the 
boardlock to allow edge regions of the lower tubular portion 
to be bent to a larger radius of curvature to fit tightly in 
the larger circuit board hole. The vertical middle portion 
of the boardlock, where the tubular upper and lower portions 
are not separated by a slot, preferably has at least one 
radially outward projection as in the form of a bump; the 
bump
