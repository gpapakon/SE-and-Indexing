<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus 10 for transferring a particulate material such as sieve 16 
from a first container 14 to a second container 26 without exposing the 

material to the atmosphere. The apparatus 10 comprises a gas circulation 
pump 12 for drawing gas from the first container 14 thereby to entrain the 

sieve, a gas/particulate separator in the form of, for example, a cyclone 
device 22 and a transfer tube 20 for transferring the mixture of gas and 

entrained material to the separator 22. An inert gas supply is connected 
to the first container so as to shield the sieve from the atmosphere. In 

operation, the vacuum acts to suck the sieve along tube 20 and into 
separator 22 in which sieve material is separated from the gas and passed 

into the second container 26 which may be a PSA plant. Separated gas and 
any unseparated particulate material may either be returned to the first 

container for re-use or directed to a second separator 32 for further 
separation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to particulate material transfer and relates 
particularly but not exclusively, to the transfer of sieve material for use 
in a pressure swing adsorption gas separation apparatus. It has been found that the increasing size and number of pressure swing 
adsorption (PSA) plants means that increasingly large quantities of 
molecular sieve material such as carbon and zeolite needs to be handled. 
Transferring the sieve from the containers in which it is transported to 
the PSA plant can be a lengthy task and direct contact with the atmosphere 
can have a deleterious effect on the sieve performance. Sieve material is usually despatched in thick plastic or steel drums or 
occasionally in 1 tonne canvas bags which are lined with polythene. The 
latter method is usually limited to the country of origin of the sieve 
material because the packing method does not fully protect the sieve 
against the atmosphere. The filling procedure on site normally consists of 
emptying the drums into 1 tonne filling bags, hoisting these to the top of 
the plant and then trickling the sieve in. The scale of the process is 
illustrated by the fact that a fifty tonne per day PSA plant will require 
nearly one hundred tonnes of sieve to be transferred in this fashion. It is an object of the present invention to provide a rapid and convenient 
means whereby sieve material can be transferred from the filling drum to 
the PSA plant whilst at the same time protecting the sieve from the effects 
of the atmosphere. According to the present invention, there is provided an apparatus for 
transferring particulate material from a first container to a second 
container, the apparatus comprising a gas circulating pump for drawing gas 
from the said first container thereby to entrain the contents thereof, gas 
supply means for supplying an inert gas to the first container and for 
mixing with the contents thereof, transfer means for transferring a 
mixture of said gas and particulate material from the first container to a 
first gas/particulate separator for separating the gas from the particulate  
 
material, said separator having a first outlet communicating with the 
second container through which particulate material is transferred thereto 
and a second outlet through which any remaining particulate material and/or 
gas is passed for disposal or further use. It will be appreciated that by entraining the sieve material in an inert 
atmosphere it will be possible to transfer particular sieve material

characterised by a gas return pipe (42) for returning any separated 

gas to the first container (14) for re-use.

therefrom.
