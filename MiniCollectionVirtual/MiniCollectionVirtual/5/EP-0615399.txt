<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sound
field controller for reproducing sound effects for use
in audio equipment or in audio-visual (AV) equipment.In recent years, as VTRs (video tape recorders)
have become a common household item, a largescreened
display and a sound reproduction system
giving a sense of presence are desired to enjoy music
recorded on recording media or programmed in softwares
as well as movies on video tapes at home, thereby
giving rise to the requirement of corresponding hardware
development.A conventional sound field controller will be
explained with reference to the figures.Figure 20 shows a hardware block diagram
indicating the structure of a conventional sound field
controller. Stereo-audio signals are input via input
terminals 1 and 2 to the sound field controller. The
conventional sound field controller comprises a multiplier
62 for multiplying an input signal by -1, an
adder 63 adds the input signals, a delay circuit 64 for
delaying the input signal by a predetermined time,
adders 12-5 and 13-5 for adding the input signals, a
multiplier 65 for multiplying the input signal by -1,
and speakers 14 and 15 for reproducing the signals and
playing the sound for a listener 16 facing the speakers
14 and 15. ML(t) and MR(t) represent a Left-channel 
signal and a Right-channel signal of the stereo-audio
signal respectively, and t represents a continuous
time, ML(t) and MR(t) being functions of time. τ3
represents the delay time in the delay circuit 64.The operation of the conventional sound field
controller configured as above will be explained with
reference to Figure 20.ML(t) is applied through the input terminal
1, and MR(t) through the input terminal 2. Each of the
signals ML(t) and MR(t) thus input is divided into two
parts, so that MR(t) is inputted to the adders 63 and
12-5 and ML(t) to the multiplier 62 and the adder 13-5.
The multiplier 62 multiplies ML(t) by -1, and the
result -ML(t) is applied to the adder 63. The adder 63
adds MR(t) and -ML(t) to produce the result
MR(t)-ML(t), which is applied to the delay circuit 64.
The delay circuit 64 delays MR(t)-ML(t) by fixed time
and produces MR(t-τ3)-ML(t-τ3). The output signal of
the delay circuit 64 is divided into two branches of
signal. One signal is applied to the adder 12-5, and
the other signal to the multiplier 65. The multiplier
65 multiplies MR(t-τ3)-ML(t-τ3) by -1, and the result
of multiplication, -(MR(t-τ3)-ML(t-τ3)), is applied to
the adder 13-5. The adder 12-5 adds MR(t) and
MR(t-τ3)-ML(t-τ3), and the sum
