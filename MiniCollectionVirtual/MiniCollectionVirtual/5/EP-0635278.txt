<ABSTRACT>
A self-aspirating hypodermic cartridge (1) which contains an 
injectable fluid therein comprising a generally cylindrical 

barrel (3) having a wall, and a plunger (10,50,44) reciprocable 
in said barrel (3) to aspirate the cartridge (1) and to expel 

said injectable fluid therefrom said plunger (10,50,44) 
comprising: a female ring component (10), with a vertically 

oriented cylindrical hole (36), having a cylindrical flat bottom 
portion (20), a cylindrical flat top portion (30) spaced from 

said cylindrical flat bottom portion (20), and a side 
portion (40) connecting said cylindrical bottom and top 

portions (20,30) and integral therewith, said side portion (40) 
having a degree of incline with respect to a horizontal plane 

of from about 1° to about 89°; a mushroom-shaped male 
component (50) having a cylindrical plunger shaft (52) 

slideably positioned into said female ring component (10), and 
a cone-shaped head (56) at one end of the shaft (52) and 

integral therewith having a degree of incline with respect to a 
horizontal plane of from about 1° to about 89°; and an 

elastomeric diaphragm-shell (44) having a cylindrical bottom 
portion (42) and a generally cone-shaped side 

portion (48) integral therewith covering said male and female 
components (50,10), said cylindrical bottom portion (42) 

being adapted to form a slideable seal between the female 
ring component (10) and the wall of the cylindrical barrel (3), 

and said cone-shaped side portion (48) being adapted to serve 
as a diaphragm whereby upon alternate exertion of pressure 

upon said plunger shaft (52) and release thereof the 
deformation of the diaphragm reduces head 
space in the 
cylindrical barrel (3) thereby expelling head space gas and 

upon release of pressure the diaphragm returns to its original 
shape resulting in aspiration, is described herein.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to syringes or cartridges which are utilized
either for the introduction or withdrawal of fluids to and
from a patient. More particularly, this invention relates to
power aspirating plungers with aspirating effect used in
conjunction with power injectors to deliver liquid imaging
agents into the body of a patient.In medical practice, hypodermic injections are
sometimes administered subcutaneously, while others must
be given intravenously, depending upon the particular
medication to be administered. In either case, it is essential
that the practitioner know with certainty, prior to injection
of the medication whether the hypodermic needle tip is
located in a major blood vessel, such as a vein, or in
subcutaneous tissue. Use of an aspirating syringe in which a
negative pressure can be generated in the syringe affords a
means of making such determination. Thus the appearance of
blood in the syringe upon generation of the negative pressure
would indicate location of the needle tip in a major blood
vessel, while the lack of appearance of blood would indicate
location of the tip in subcutaneous tissue. Depending upon the
type of injection intended, the injection can then either
proceed directly, or if appropriate the tip can be withdrawn
and relocated.Aspirating syringes are generally of two types, namely,
they are either manually or automatically aspirated. In the
manually aspirated type the plunger is retracted for a short
distance within the barrel of the syringe. This retraction
lowers the pressure within the syringe which leaves fluids at
the needle tip which are then observable within the barrel of
the syringe. From solid tissues no fluids will be drawn into
the barrel. In the manually aspirated syringes the injection
necessitates the use of both hands, one to hold the barrel, and 
the other to exert pressure in a rearward direction on
the plunger. Such manually actuatable aspirating
syringes have the disadvantage that their proper use
depends on very large measure on the degree of skill of
the person administering the injections.Aspiration in syringes of the automatic or self-aspirating
type is effected by first inducing a positive
pressure in a medicament-containing portion of the
syringe, for example in a disposable cartridge ampoule.
On release of the force inducing the positive pressure,
a corresponding negative pressure in the syringe is
generated thus giving rise to the aspirating effect. The
present invention relates to this self-aspirating type
of syringe.Ideally a

<CLAIMS>
A self-aspirating syringe or cartridge (1) having
an aspirating plunger comprising: a female ring

component (10); a male component (50) having a shaft
(52) and a cone-shaped head (56), said shaft being

slidably positioned inside said female ring component;
and an elastomeric diaphragm shell (44) covering said

female ring component (10) and said cone-shaped head
(56) of said male component, wherein upon exertion of

pressure on the shaft (52) deformation of the diaphragm
(44) reduces head space in the syringe or cartridge (1)

thereby expelling head space gas, and upon release of

said pressure on said shaft (52) the diaphragm (44)
returns to its original shape resulting in aspiration.
A self-aspirating syringe or cartridge as claimed
in claim 1, wherein the female ring component (10) has a

frustoconical surface (40) having an angle of
inclination to the axis of the plunger.
A self-aspirating syringe or cartridge as claimed
in claim 2, wherein the cone-shaped head (56) of the

male component (50) has an angle of inclination
substantially identical to that of the frustoconical

surface (40) of the female ring component (10).
A self-aspirating syringe or cartridge as claimed
in claim 3, wherein the angle of inclination is between

1° and 89°, is preferably between 30° and 60°, and is
more preferably around 45°.
A self-aspirating syringe or cartridge as claimed
in any preceding claim, wherein the female ring

component (10) has a cylindrical wall, this wall having
a groove (26) in which a portion of the elastomeric

diaphragm shell (44) is retained. 
A self-aspirating syringe or cartridge as claimed
in any preceding claim, wherein said female component

(10) and said male component (40) are formed from a
rigid polymeric material.
A self-aspirating hypodermic cartridge (1) which

cylindrical plunger shaft (52) slidably positioned into

said female ring component (10), and a cone-shaped head
(56) at one end of the shaft (52) and integral therewith
