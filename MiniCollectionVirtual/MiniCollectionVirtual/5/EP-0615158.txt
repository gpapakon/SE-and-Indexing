<ABSTRACT>
A silver halide photographic light-sensitive material is 
disclosed. The light-sensitive material comprises a support 

having thereon a silver halide emulsion and optionally a 
hydrophilic colloid layer other than the emulsion layer. At 

least one of these layers contains a latex of polymer 
comprising a repeating unit derived from a monomer having a 

solubility in water of not higher than 0.025 % by weight at 
25째C and the content of said repeating unit in said polymer is 

not less than 50 % by weight.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a silver halide photographic 
light-sensitive material, and more particularly to a 
silver halide photographic light-sensitive material whose layer 
physical properties are improved without affecting its photographic 
characteristics. Generally speaking, the hydrophilic colloid layer of a 
silver halide photographic light-sensitive material is required 
not only to have no bad influence upon its photographic characteristics 
but also to have a necessary performance for its 
layer physical/antistatic properties. Therefore, various 
attempts have conventionally been made, when coating on a support 
a hydrophilic colloid layer such as a silver halide emulsion 
layer, an interlayer or a protective layer, to improve 
the hydrophilic colloid layer's physical properties such as  
 
dimensional stability, scratch resistance, elasticity, pressure 
resistance and drying characteristic in the manner of incorporating 
a polymer latex formed by polymerization of various 
monomers into the hydrophilic colloid layer; and other attempts 
to improve the antistatic characteristics of the hydrophilic 
colloid layer by preventing the phenomenon called static marks, 
appearing in the form of spots or branched or feather-like 
marks when the light-sensitive emulsion layer is exposed to 
discharge of static electricity having accumulated and then 
processed, in the manner of dispersing the accumulated static 
charge by adding a surfactant to the surface of the hydrophilic 
colloid layer. From the above point of view, there have heretofore been 
proposed the use of a latex of polyvinyl acetate in U.S. Patent 
No. 2,376,005; the use of a latex of a polyalkyl acrylate in 
U.S. Patent No. 3,325,286; the use of latexes of polymers of 
n-butyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, styrene, butadiene, vinyl 
acetate and acrylonitril in Japanese Patent Examined Publication 
(hereinaftere abbreviated to JP E.P.) No. 5331/1970; the 
use of latexes of polymers of an alkyl acrylate, acrylic acid 
and sulfoalkyl acrylate in JP E.P. No. 22506/1971; the use of 
polymer latexes containing 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonic 
acid in Japanese Patent Publication Open to Public Inspection 
(hereinafter abbreviated to JP O.P.I.) No. 130217/1976; the 
use of the anionic, betaine and cationic activators described  
 
in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,082,123, 3,201,251, 3,519,561 and 
3,625,695, West German Patent Nos. 1,552,408 and 1,597,472, JP 
O.P.I. Nos. 85826/1974, 129623/1978, 159223/1979 and 19213/1973, 
and JP E.P. Nos.
