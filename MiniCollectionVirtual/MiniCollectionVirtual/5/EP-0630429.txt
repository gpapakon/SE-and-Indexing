<ABSTRACT>
In order to spin a thread (4) by means of an open-end rotor spinning device, the threads are supplied to a thread guiding surface (16) from which the threads are deposited on the sliding wall (7) of a spinning rotor (1) after crossing a gap (17). An air flow (30) is blown into the spinning rotor (1) through a gap (17), then evacuated from the inside of the spinning rotor (1) without going once again through the gap (17). A device (9, 20) is associated to the gap (17) in order to generate the air flow by generating a pressure drop that makes the air flow (30) through the gap (17) into the spinning rotor (1).

A process for spinning a thread (4) with the aid of an open-end spinning device comprising 
a spinning rotor, in which the fibres are conveyed to a fibre-guiding surface (16) 

which widens out in the direction towards the spinning rotor and from which the fibres 
are deposited on a widening sliding surface (7) of the spinning rotor while passing 

across a gap (17), 
characterized in that
 an air stream (30) is directed through the gap 
(17) into the interior of the spinning rotor (1), and is then removed from the interior of 

the spinning rotor (1) without passing through the gap (17) again. 
A process according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the air stream (30) directed 
through the gap (17) into the interior of the spinning rotor (1) is produced by compressed 

air supplied to the outer periphery ofthe gap (17). 
A process according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the air stream (30) directed 
through the gap (17) into the interior of the spinning rotor (1) is produced by a suction-air 

stream drawn away out ofthe spinning rotor (1). 
A process according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that
 the suction-air stream is 
produced by the rotation of the spinning rotor (1). 
A process according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that
 the suction-air stream produced 
by the rotation of the spinning rotor (1) and drawn away out of the spinning rotor (1) is 

introduced through the gap (17) into the spinning rotor (1) again, so that a circulating 
flow occurs. 
A process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 5,

deflected, whilst the remainder of this air together with the fibres is conveyed on a 
spiral path to the widened end of the fibre-guiding surface (16), from where the fibres 

are transferred to the sliding wall (7) of the spinning rotor (1) by way of the gap (17), 
wherein the air stream (30) entering through the gap (17) prevents the fibres from 

escaping through the gap (17), after which the fibres arrive at the fibre-collection 
groove (8) in a known manner for spinning, whilst the air conveyed through the gap 

(17) into the interior of the spinning rotor (1) is removed from the spinning rotor (1)
