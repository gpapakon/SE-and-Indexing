<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a base station of a cellular network of the GSM type, intended for exchanging data in the form of radio signals with mobiles (MS) moving about in a defined geographical area, called principal cell (C), and subdivided into a plurality of cells called elementary cells (S1, S2, S3), each corresponding to a defined portion of the principal cell (C), and each associated with a receiver (R1, R2, R3) equipped with a directional antenna (A1, A2, A3). The base station includes a single transmitter (E) equipped with an omnidirectional antenna (A0) and providing the radio coverage on transmission of all the elementary cells (S1, S2, S3), so that the data transmitted by the base station (BTS) in the form of radio signals to a mobile (MS) located in any one of the elementary cells (S1, S2, S3) are transmitted by the transmitter (E).

Method of exchanging data between, firstly, a base transceiver station of a
cellular mobile radio network adapted to exchange data by radio with mobiles

(MS) in a delimited geographical area called the main cell (C), said main cell (C)
covering a plurality of sectors (S
1
, S
2
, S
3
) each corresponding to a specific
portion of said main cell (C) and each associated with a receiver (R
1
, R
2
, R
3
)
having a directional antenna (A
1
, A
2
, A
3
), said base transceiver station including
a single transmitter (E) having an omnidirectional antenna (A
0
) and providing
transmit radio coverage for all said sectors (S
1
, S
2
, S
3
) and, secondly, a mobile
in said main cell, said exchange of data being adapted in particular to establish

a radio link between said mobile and said base transceiver station so that a
traffic channel on an upward traffic frequency and a traffic channel on a

downward traffic frequency are assigned to said mobile for transmission of
speech or computer data, said method comprising the following operations:


said mobile transmits at least one connection request or access request to
said base transceiver station on a specific access channel on an upward control

channel,
a base station controller controlling said base transceiver station
determines, for each of said receivers, the level and/or quality of the access

signal constituted by said request and received at each of said receivers and in
this way selects whichever of said receivers for which the access signal has the

best quality and/or the best level as the receiver to be used for speech or
computer data signals transmitted by said mobile,
an upward traffic channel is assigned to said mobile for its exclusive use on
said upward traffic frequency,
a respective downward traffic channel is assigned to said mobile on said
downward traffic frequency, said traffic channel being shifted in time relative to

said upward traffic channel, and
each of the other mobiles in said main cell and connected to said base
transceiver station is associated with a downward traffic channel on said

downward traffic frequency shifted in time relative to all the traffic channels
assigned to the other mobiles on said downward traffic frequency and to an

upward traffic channel on said upward traffic frequency shifted in time relative to
all the traffic channels assigned to the other mobiles on said upward traffic

frequency.
Method of exchanging data according to claim 1 characterised in that said
exchange of data is additionally adapted to maintain access of said mobile to

said base transceiver station when said mobile moves from an old sector to a
new sector, said method then including the following operations:


during the time slot corresponding to the upward traffic channel assigned
to said mobile each of said receivers, including the old receiver used for the

speech or computer data signals transmitted by said mobile, receives the speech
or computer data signals transmitted by said mobile,
after demodulation of each of said speech or computer data signals, the
signal obtained by combining said speech or computer data signals is shifted

into the base band and transmitted to said base station controller, and
communication continues on the same upward traffic channel via a new
receiver.
Method of exchanging data according to claim 1 characterised in that said
exchange of data is further adapted to maintain access of said mobile to said

base transceiver station when said mobile moves from an old sector to a new
sector, said method then including the following operations:


during the time slot corresponding to the upward traffic channel assigned
to said mobile each of said receivers, including the old receiver used for the

speech or computer data signals transmitted by said mobile, receives the speech
or computer data signals transmitted by said mobile,
the speech or computer data signals from each of said receivers are shifted
into the base band and then transmitted to said base station controller,
said base station controller interrupts communication and, using one or
more predetermined criteria, selects the receiver to be used for further

communication and thus for transmission of said speech or computer data
signals from said mobile to said base station controller,
communication is established again on the same upward traffic channel,
and
the speech or computer data signals and signalling data signals from said
mobile and from said selected receiver are shifted into the base band and then

transmitted to said base station controller.
Method according to claim 3 characterised in that one of said predetermined
criteria is the receive level at each of said receivers.
Method according to claim 3 or claim 4 characterised in that one of said 
predetermined criteria is the quality of the signal from each of said receivers,

before or after decoding.
Base station controller characterised in that it is adapted to implement the
method according to any one of claims 1 to 5.
Base transceiver station characterised in that it is adapted to implement the
method according to any one of claims 1 to 5.
