(14) provided with at least one product engagement element (20) 

and movable between different positions, and means for driving the 
at least one carriage (14) between the different positions, 

wherein with the at least one carriage (14) there is associated at 
least one locator element (27) interacting with external elements (28, 29) 

arranged to determine the limits of a preselectable travel path. 
A handling apparatus consists of a plurality of such devices (11).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a product handling device and relative 
apparatus. In systems for handling a product and/or groups of products which 
have to be picked up in a first position and/or mutual arrangement 
and deposited for subsequent treatment or packaging in a second 
position and/or arrangement, devices having a specific fixed and 
unchangeable location in the two arrangements are usually used. These devices therefore have to be replaced if the two desired 
arrangements are changed, because the gripping elements are 
mutually correlated by pneumatic or mechanical mechanisms having a 
predetermined and unchangeable travel path. This involves a loss 
of time and production on replacing the various units, together 
with considerable investment in the purchase of units with the 
different travel path required for handling products of different 
size and different mutual arrangement. An object of the present invention is to provide a handling device 
enabling products to be picked up and product groups to be created 
in various mutual arrangements, which is extremely simple and such 
as to eliminate complicated mechanical and/or pneumatic mechanisms 
associated with it.  A further object is to provide a handling device which can be 
easily and quickly adapted to form different product arrangements. A further object is to provide a handling apparatus of rapidly 
changeable function, which is of simple and low-cost construction. These objects are attained according to the present invention by a 
product handling device comprising at least one carriage provided 
with at least one product engagement element and movable between 
different positions, and means for driving said at least one 
carriage between said different positions, characterised in that 
with said at least one carriage there is associated at least one 
locator element interacting with external elements arranged to 
determine the limits of a preselectable travel path. The structural and functional characteristics of a device 
according to the present invention will be more apparent from the 
description given hereinafter by way of non-limiting example with 
reference to the accompanying drawings, in which: 
Figure 1 is a partly sectional elevation of a single handling 
device according to the invention; Figure 2 is a partly sectional exploded view of the device of 
Figure 1; Figure 3 is a partly sectional partial front view of an 
arrangement of several devices of the type shown in Figure 1; Figure 4 is a front view of an apparatus

<CLAIMS>
A product handling device (11) comprising at least one 
carriage (14) provided with at least one product engagement 

element (20) and movable between different positions, and means 
for driving said at least one carriage (14) between said different 

positions, characterised in that with said at least one carriage 
(14) there is associated at least one locator element (27) 

interacting with external elements (28,29) arranged to determine the 
limits of a preselectable travel path. 
A handling device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that said external elements (28,29) arranged to determine the limits of a 

preselectable travel path are freely removable. 
A handling device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that said at least one locator element consists of a pin (27), 

said external elements arranged to determine the limits of a 
preselectable travel path consisting of a plate (29) provided with 

at least one slot (28). 
A handling device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that said drive means for said at least one carriage (14) consist 

of a dragging element (21) and at least one engagement element 
(23, 26) positioned on said carriage and interacting with said 

dragging element (21). 
A handling device as claimed in claim 4, characterised in 
that said engagement element is an elastic engagement element. 
A handling device as claimed in claim 5, characterised in 
that a pair of housings (22a, 22b) for receiving said elastic 

engagement elements (23, 26) are provided in the body of said 
 

carriage (14). 
A handling device as claimed in claim 4 or 5, 
characterised in that said carriage is provided with at least one 

housing (18) in which said dragging element (21) is slidable, said 
elastic engagement element (23) being located in a second housing 

(22a, 22b) having one end connected to said first housing (18). 
A handling device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that said carriage (14) is movable on guide elements (13) fixed to 

a base plate (12), said elements (28, 29) arranged to determine 
the limits of a preselectable travel path being also fixed to said 

base plate (12). 
A handling device as claimed in claim 5, characterised in 
that said elastic engagement element comprises a pad (23) 

associated with a spring (26). 
A handling device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that said drive means consist of external elements, such as 

motors, for moving said at least one carriage. 
An apparatus for the pick-up and ordered depositing of 
products between two positions, comprising a plurality of handling 

devices in accordance with any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that said elements arranged to determine the 

limits of a preselectable travel path comprise a plate (29)
