<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to 
knock sensor systems and, more specifically, to a knock 
sensor diagnostic system for an internal combustion 
engine. Generally, normal combustion in a spark 
ignition internal combustion engine occurs when part of 
a fuel mixture is ignited by a spark from an ignition 
plug and a resulting flame spreads out into the fuel 
mixture. Knocking occurs in this process when part or 
all of the uncombusted fuel mixture ignites itself 
before propagation of the flame. This self ignition is 
caused by an increase in temperature due to the 
compression of the fuel mixture. The knocking of the 
engine causes a rapid increase in pressure in the 
combustion chamber and the propagation of a pressure 
wave which result in mechanical vibration in the engine 
components and overheats the ignition plugs and engine 
components. Various kinds of knock sensor systems have 
been designed to detect vibration sounds, mechanical 
vibration acceleration, or combustion internal pressure  
 
vibrations of an internal combustion engine. The 
detection of this engine knock is desirable in that 
engine operating parameters can be adjusted to avoid 
such a condition. Now, under federal regulations, the various 
knock sensor systems must also include a knock sensor 
diagnostic system. The diagnostic system will be used 
to test the integrity of the knock sensor system and 
report any detected problems to the operator. It is, therefore, an object of the present 
invention to provide a system of diagnosing a knock 
sensor system. It is another object of the present invention 
to provide a knock sensor diagnostic system for 
piezoelectric narrow band knock sensors without any 
major modifications to existing knock sensor systems. It is yet another object of the present 
invention to provide a knock sensor diagnostic circuit 
which utilizes the reciprocal electromechanical 
properties of ceramic/piezoelectric resonators. To achieve the foregoing objects, the present 
invention is a knock sensor system for detecting knock 
in an engine. The knock sensor system includes a knock 
sensor operatively connected to the engine and a knock 
sensor circuit connected to the knock sensor. The knock  
 
sensor system also includes a controller connected to 
the knock sensor circuit and means for diagnosing the 
knock sensor circuit to determine if the knock sensor is 
installed and operating correctly. One advantage of the knock sensor diagnostic 
system is that it is adaptable to current production
