<ABSTRACT>
The cooling system for cylinders of printing machines comprises at least one compressed-air line (18) having at least one compressed-air opening (20) for blowing cold air against a cylinder (6) to be cooled. At least one recirculation loop (30, 32, 34, 36, 28) is provided, which is separate from the cold air of the compressed-air line (18), sucks off air blown onto the cylinder from the compressed-air opening (20) by means of a fan (28) contained in the recirculation loop, and blows it back onto the cylinder (6) parallel to the cold air. As a result, the temperature of the cold air (22) can be effective on the cylinder (6) without the temperature previously having been changed. The cold air deflected by the cylinder is fed back onto the cylinder (6) for additional cooling.
