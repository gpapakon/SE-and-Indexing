<ABSTRACT>
An electrical connector provided with at least one contact element designed as a plug contact and made up of two elongated plate parts (2, 3) which extend from a base part (1), are thereto joined in a fixed manner by means of one end (4, 5) and are situated opposite one another having a mutual interspace (8). The two plate parts (2, 3) are formed so as to taper towards one another at their free ends (6, 7). The plate parts (2, 3) may be flat and form the boundary of an interspace (8) having an essentially hollow, rectangular cross section or they may have a surface which is curved transversely to their longitudinal direction. As stiffening, the two plate parts (2, 3) are in physical contact at their free ends (6, 7), and may be provided, between the fixed (4, 5) and the free end (6, 7), with one or more protuberances which face one another.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an electrical connector in accordance with the preamble of claim 1.An electrical power connector provided with contact elements
having a contact end designed as a plug contact of the type mentioned
above is known from US-A-4,881,905.Plug contact elements are usually made by pressing, flattening or
another suitable mechanical processing from stiff, solid electrically
conducting material. Embodiments of plug contacts are also known which
are made up of two or more solid parts, each having, for example, a
circular-sector-shaped cross section. These known plug contacts have the
common characteristic that they form a stiff entity.It has been found that such stiff plug contacts have a number of
disadvantages which, in particular, weigh heavily in producing
connectors having reduced dimensions for which there is a still growing
requirement in view of the current trend for scale reduction
(miniaturisation) of electronic components.In contrast to a plug contact element made up of stiff solid
material, plug contacts formed from plate material, have certain
flexible properties. The two plate parts can be moved in the direction
towards and away from one another and can also be displaced with respect 
to one another. This results in a self-aligning action on making contact
to a further contact element having a contact end designed, for example,
as socket contact when the two contact ends are not exactly in line with
one another. In particular, in the case of connectors having relatively
large numbers of plug contacts, for example 80 or more, this self-aligning
action has a beneficial effect on achieving as low as possible
an insertion force for the making of connector contact. Moreover, this
self-aligning action promotes the contact reliability between the
contact elements which are to make contact.In the plug contact element known from US-A-4,881,905 the two
oppositely spaced elongated plate parts are joined to the base part in a
cantilevered manner. That is to say, the free ends of the plate parts
are not in physical contact with one another. When contacting a further
contact element, i.e. a socket contact element, the plate parts are
deflected towards each other which produces a certain mechanical stress
in the contact element. In order to reduce the amount of deflection and
stress without affecting the thickness, length and material constant of
the contact element, the width of the plate parts has to be enlarged.
This however contraverses the current trend for scale reduction in the
elect
