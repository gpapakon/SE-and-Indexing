<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a pivoting door (1) for a passageway (2), having a housing, having a door leaf (3) which is arranged on the housing and can be pivoted by an electric drive, and having an arresting device which is intended for arresting the door leaf in its initial position and in its open position, it being possible for the electric drive to be activated by means (4) which are arranged outside the housing, and provision being made for further control means which control functioning of the pivoting door (1) following the activation of the electric drive. The essence of the invention consists in that the further control means are formed by a microcontroller, by power electronics and by a sensor arrangement which acts in a contactless manner, and in that there is provided a reading device for information media on which there are stored functional data of the pivoting door (1), it being possible for these data to be stored in the microcontroller with the aid of the reading device.
