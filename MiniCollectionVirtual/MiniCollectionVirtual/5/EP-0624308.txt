<ABSTRACT>
The positioning and guidance system essentially consists of a seedling tray holder (2) guided vertically on a carriage (3), itself guided horizontally relative to a frame (4) on which are fixed means for ejecting the soil plugs and means for taking hold of the said soil plugs and planting them out. The seedling tray holder (2) is in the form of a plate equipped with passages (20) for the ejection means and horizontal slots (16) corresponding to the lines of the cells. These horizontal slots (16) are joined together and form a sort of path which extends between the lower and upper ends of the plate. A limit stop (21) integral with the frame interacts with the path formed by the slots (16) in order to guide the seedling tray holder (2).

A guiding and positioning system for a vertical 
seedling tray (2) on a machine used for transplanting clod-cultivated 

plants into cells arranged in rows and columns on a 
tray (1) and which contains : - a wagon (3) fitted with means 

for guiding vertically at least one tray-carrier; - a frame 
(4) fitted with means in order to, on the one hand, guide the 

said wagon (3) horizontally and, on the other hand, to move 
step by step this wagon over a distance corresponding at least 

to the interval between two columns; - means for ejecting the 
clods in the form of pushers ; - means for picking up and 

transplanting the said
 
clods and a seedling tray (2) in the form of a tray fitted 

with passages for the said ejection means, characterised in 
that the tray is fitted with horizontal grooves (16) 

corresponding to the lines of cells, whereby the said grooves 
(16) are linked to one another to form a path (17) between the 

lower and upper ends of the said tray and in that the system 
comprises a stop (21) connected rigidly to the said frame (4) 

working together with the said path in order to guide the 
seedling tray (2). 
A positioning and guiding system for a seedling tray 
according to claim 1, characterised in that it contains a stop 

(21) in the form of a roller whose diameter corresponds to the 
width of the guiding groove (16). 
A positioning and guiding system for a seedling tray 
according to claim 2, characterised in that it contains a 

pusher (25) axed with the centre of the roller (21).  
 
A positioning and guiding system for a seedling tray 
according to claim 1, characterised in that the portion of the 

path (19) between two successive grooves (16) is rounded in 
order to prevent the seedling tray from falling suddenly at 

the ends of the said grooves (16). 
A positioning and guiding system for a seedling tray 
according to claim 1, characterised in that the seelding tray 

(2) contains, centred in the grooves (16), holes corresponding 
to the cells in the tray (1), enabling the passage of the 

pusher (25). 
A positioning and guiding system for a seedling tray 
according to any of the claims 1 to 5, characterised in that 

the plate constituting the said seedling tray is made of an 
aluminium-type material. 
A positioning and guiding system for a seedling tray 
according to any of the claims 1 to 6, characterised in that 

the plate constituting the said seedling tray is fitted with 
vertical side grooves (10), working with guides (11) for the 

wagon (3).
