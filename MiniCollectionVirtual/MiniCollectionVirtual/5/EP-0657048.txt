<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process and devices for its implementation for parallel-operating multiprocessor combinations for electronic data processing, the processors of which have individual data stores (8.1, 8.1', 8.1'', 8.n), control stores (7.1, 7.1', 7.1'', 7.n) and interfaces with the joint communication system (2) in which the joint communication system is programmable as a whole to a superior set of process conditions and can actuate independently in accordance with said conditions. The individual processors receive individual algorithms, data sets and protocol instructions in their stores before the communication. The individual processors process data sets independently with algorithms, calculate individual results. All individual results are communicably and independently supplied as data in accordance with the protocol instructions to all the processors.

Parallel-operating electronic data processing multiprocessor
system whose processors have individual data memories, instruction

memories and interfaces to a common communications system characterized
in that


the common communications system as a whole is programmed as an
overriding body and is operated in an autonomous manner according to

execution sequences
wherein, before a communications session, the memories of the
processors being addressed according to the programmed execution

sequences of the communication system are supplied with individual
algorithms, data sets and protocol instructions,
wherein the protocol instructions define tasks and functions as
well as communications criteria regarding the temporal conditions of

the data exchange of the individual processors with the communications
system
and wherein, during a communications session, the individual
processors process data sets independently according to their

individual algorithms and supply results as data independently
according to protocol instructions to all processors.
System according to claim 1, characterized in that
autonomy exists in that the individual processors transmit and

receive data independently in accordance with the protocol
instructions.
System according to one of the claims 1 or 2,
characterized in that the autonomy consists of the individual

processors independently updating their individual data sets
with the communicated data in accordance with the protocol

instructions and then further process their individual algorithms
with said independent, updated, individual data sets.
System according to claim 3, characterized in that
the individual processors autonomously update their individual

data sets by counting the communicated data.
System according to one of the claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the autonomy consists of a schedule with

communications packet sizes being fixed between the individual 
processors corresponding to the protocol instructions prior to

the communication.
System according to claim 5, characterized in that
identically large communications packet sizes are used between

the individual processors.
System according to claim 5, characterized in that
differently large communications packet sizes are used between

the individual processors.
System according to one of the claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the autonomy consists of the bandwidth

of the transmissions between the individual processors being
fixed in accordance with the protocol instructions prior to

the communication.
System according to claim 8, characterized in that
multiplexing takes place with accessing to data from several

processors via several transmission bandwidths.
System according to claim 9, characterized in that
the transmission widths are subdivided into several, narrower

and independent transmission channels corresponding to the
size of the data to be communicated.
System according to one of the claims I to 10,
characterized in that the individual processors only communicate

with one another by transmitting and receiving data via
interfaces with respect to the communication system.
System according to claim 11, characterized in that
modified data from individual data sets are communicated as

data.
Communications system foruse in the multiprocessor system

individual processors have communications controllers, which 
control the opening and closing of the data memories via

interfaces to the communications system.
Communications system according to claim 13,
characterized in that the communications controllers operate

independently of the individual processors and that the
individual processors operate independently of the opening and

closing of the data memories and the communication via the
interfaces.
Communications system according to claim 13,
characterized in that several communications controllers are

combined together on a module.
Communications system according to claim 13,

more processors feeding data autonomously into said communications
controllers, in which calculations take place.
Communications system according to claim 13,
characterized in that one or more communications controllers

operate as operating mechanisms, one or more processors
