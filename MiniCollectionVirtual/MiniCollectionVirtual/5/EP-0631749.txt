<ABSTRACT>
The mattress-type upholstered cushion (1,2,3) of equal thickness rests on each of the three supports (17,27,37). The seat cushion (3) extends backwards to underneath the back rest cushion (2), the bottom end of which slopes so that, when pulled out in a reclining position, the two sloping parts of cushions overlap and form a narrow, downward sloping gap (S). The hinges (30) joining the seat cushion support (37) and the backrest cushion support (27) are flush with the backrest cushion support, with their pivot axles on the seat cushion support. The base frame (11-14) is made of metal struts, with stop (34).
