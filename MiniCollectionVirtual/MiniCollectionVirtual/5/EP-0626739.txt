<ABSTRACT>
A tool for laying electrical cables, and possibly cutting them to length, for the automatic production of wiring systems for electrical equipment has a laying finger (2) which is arranged on a housing (1) and in which a guide duct (4) for a cable is constructed. A pressure element (19) is provided in the vicinity of the side opening (10) in the guide duct. This pressure element (19) has a pressure surface (22) which moves essentially transversely with respect to the axial direction of the guide duct and to which cutting-off means in the form of a knife blade (12) are assigned, which means are likewise mounted on the laying finger such that they can be displaced. The knife blade interacts with a region of the wall of the guide duct.

Tool for positioning and cutting to length electrical
wires, having a housing (1) fitted for connection to

positioning means, e.g. an industrial robot, having a
positioning finger (2) disposed on a working side of the

housing, in which finger a guide duct (4) having a lateral
outlet opening is formed for a wire (5), and also having

feed and cutting means for the wire, said tool having a
pressing element (19), which is disposed in the vicinity of

the outlet opening (10) of the guide duct for the wire
exiting from the opening of the guide duct and which is

movably located for movement transversely to the axial
direction of the guide duct in the region of the outlet

opening and is coupled to its own position control means
(21), by means of which it may be displaced between a

position removed from the outlet opening and a working
position, 
characterised in that
in the working position, the pressing element (19) with a
pressure surface (22) projects beyond the edge of the

outlet opening of the guide duct (4) or is flush with the
upper side of the edge of the outlet opening,
that the pressing element (19) adjoining a surface (9)
containing the outlet opening (10) is disposed on the

positioning finger (2) to be longitudinally slidable, and
that the longitudinally slidable cutting means (12) for the
wire are arranged to cooperate with a region of the wall of

the guide duct in the vicinity of its outlet opening (10).
Tool according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 in the
region of the pressure surface (22), the pressing element

(19) has a rib (24) aligned with the wire exiting from the
outlet opening (10) of the guide duct, the width of said

rib, transversely to the wire direction, being essentially
smaller than/equal to the diameter of the wire (5). 
Tool according to Claim 2, 
characterised in that
 the rib
(24) is bordered on at least one side by at least one

region (23; 25) of greater width.
Tool according to Claim 2 or 3, 
characterised in that
 a
projecting nose (25) is disposed on at least one side of

the rib (24).
Tool according to Claim 4, 
characterised in that
 the region
of greater width (23; 25) has the same width as the

positioning finger (2).
Tool according to one of Claims 2 to 5, 
characterised in
that
 the rib (24) is bordered on both sides by regions of
greater width (23, 25), of which one (23) adjoins an area

(9) of the positioning finger containing the outlet opening
(10) of the guide duct (4).
Tool according to one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
 the cutting means have at least one
knife disposed to be longitudinally slidable on the

positioning finger (2) having a blade element (12), its
blade element being movably disposed above an essentially

horizontal portion of the guide duct (4).
Tool according to Claim 7, 
characterised in that
 the blade
element (12) has at least one cutting edge (14) extending

at an inclination to the associated wall of the guide duct
(4).
Tool according to Claim 8, 
characterised in that
 the blade
element has a cutting tip (18) which may be pressed onto

the associated wall of the guide duct. 
Tool according to Claim 9, 
characterised in that
 the
cutting tip (18) is located in the vicinity of the outlet

opening (10) of the guide duct.
Tool according to Claim 7, 
characterised in that
 the blade
element (12) adjoining the pressing element (19) is

disposed to slide on the positioning finger (2) and/or the
pressing element (19).
Tool according to one of Claims 2 to 11, 
characterised in
that
 the pressing element (19) is constructed of multiple
parts, and that each of its parts is assigned its own

pressure surface portion.
