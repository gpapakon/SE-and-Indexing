<ABSTRACT>
An adiabatic evaporation and cooling of a solvent from a melt of 
organic chemicals containing the solvent is conducted in a 

crystallizer 1. Crystals which are formed by this operation is 
removed from the crystallizer 1 and vapor from the crystallizer 

1 is introduced to an absorption condenser 2. A feed solution 
of the melt is introduced to the absorption condenser 2 in which 

it is brought into contact with the vapor to condense the vapor. 
The condensate is introduced to the crystallizer 1.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for crystallizing 
a melt of organic chemicals for separation and purification and 
in particular to a process for crystallizing a melt of organic 
chemicals with adiabatic cooling using an absorption condenser 
and an apparatus for the same. The process for crystallizing an organic material includes; 
(1) a melt crystallization and purifying process in which 
crystals are removed from the melt by cooling the melt without 
charging a third material such as solvent into the melt; (2) crystallization process by cooling a solution which is 
added with a solvent which is dissolved in the solution; and (3) a process for cooling a two-liquid phase solution which 
is added with a solvent (for example, water) which is not 
dissolved therein. Cooling methods for industrial crystallization are 
classified in view of apparatus as follows: A melt of organic chemicals is charged into an elongated 
cylindrical double walled pipe which is provided with a cooling 
jacket on an outer cylinder. Cooling water is circulated through 
the cooling jacket so that crystals are deposited on the inner  
 
wall of the pipe. The deposited crystals are scraped by scraping 
blades to remove them as slurry and the slurry is separated into 
solid (crystals) and liquid in the other side of the system. A melt of organic chemicals is charged into a tank having 
an agitator and simultaneously, solvent such as water which is 
dissolved to the organic chemicals is poured therein. 
Crystallization is conducted by cooling the water while the 
organic chemicals are dispersed in water. Organic chemicals are dissolved in a solvent. Adiabatic 
vaporization is conducted in a crystallizer. Resultant vapor is 
condensed in a condenser. Condensed refrigerant is returned 
to the crystallizer, again. The above mentioned melt purifying process (1) has serious 
problems that operation temperature is elevated, operation 
becomes difficult and deterioration of quality of the organic 
chemical occurs since the organic chemicals to be crystallized 
are molten at high temperatures. The indirect cooling method (A) has a disadvantage that the 
apparatus becomes larger in size and incorporation of a scraping 
machine is necessary and thus the cost of construction of the 
apparatus is high since the heat conduction coefficient is as low 
as about 200 to 500 kcal/m²·°C·hr. The direct cooling method (B) which may be classified as 
the method (3) requires much cost to treat a small amount of 
organic chemical which may be
