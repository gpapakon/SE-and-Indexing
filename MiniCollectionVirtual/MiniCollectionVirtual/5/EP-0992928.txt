<ABSTRACT>
A background-sound switching apparatus, a background-sound
switching method, a readable recording medium (5) containing

a background-sound switching program (5), and a video game
apparatus (1) allow suitable switching of background-music

data. A partitioning code (53) represents the end position
of a phrase of background sounds outputted through a speaker

(4). Switching instruction means (72) outputs a switching-instruction
signal which causes switching from the

background-sound data (52) being outputted to a D/A
converter (18) to other background-sound data. Following

output of the switching-instruction signal, data-number
control means (82) allows a RAM (8) to store a data number

(54) which defines the next background-sound data (52) to be
outputted to the D/A converter (18). Code-detecting means

(83) detects the partitioning code (53) of the background-sound
data (52) being outputted. At each time the

partitioning code (53) is detected, switching control means
(84) determines whether or not the data number (54) is

stored in the RAM (8); and if the data number (54) is stored
in the RAM (8), the background-sound data (52) being

outputted is switched to the other background-sound data
(52) defined by the data number (54).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a background-sound switching apparatus, a background-sound switching method, and a readable recording medium containing a background-sound switching program which switch background sounds created corresponding to variations of events to be displayed in display means.Hitherto, a system for displaying variations of events, for example, in a video game, has been known. In this system, generally, background sounds created corresponding to images to be displayed on display means are outputted through a speaker so as to improve the effectiveness of the images displayed on the display means. For example, in a video game, background sounds produced corresponding to game images are outputted through a speaker so as to improve the simulation realism of the game. Generally, these background sound pieces are composed using multiple pieces of background-sound data created for, for example, individual game stages; and the background-sound data to be outputted through the speaker is switched as the displayed game stage changes.However, the background-sound data to be outputted through the speaker is not suitably switched. This causes unnatural changes when the switching boundary is perceived by the ear, preventing the effectiveness of displayed images from being improved.For an example of the prior art see EP-A-0 847 782.In view of the above problems, an object of the present invention is to provide a background-sound switching apparatus, a background-sound switching method, a readable recording medium in which a background-sound switching program is recorded, and a video game apparatus that allow background-sound data to be switched suitably.To achieve the above, according to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a background-music switching apparatus having display means for displaying variations of events, sound-generating means for generating background sounds, background-sound-data storing means containing background-sound data which is time-series data having been prepared corresponding to the events and including partitioning codes at predetermined partitioning positions, output control means for creating the background-sound data to the sound-generating means to generate background sounds, code-detecting means for detecting the partitioning code in the background-sound data being outputted to the sound-generating means, switching instruction means for outputting an instruction signal for switching from the background-sound data being outputted to the
