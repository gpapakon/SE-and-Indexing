<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a device for temporarily connecting a pressure-fluid source to a consumption element. The device contains a receiver connection (76) and a supply connection (54), which are at least temporarily arranged opposite one another in a predetermined longitudinal direction (2) and are connected in each case to the consumption element and to the source of the pressure fluid. The supply connection (54) contains a retractable seal in the form of an elongate, tubular piston (64) which, when loaded by pressure fluid, moves from a drawn-back rest position into an active position, in which it comes to bear against an annular transverse surface (75) of the receiver connection (76) in order to connect the respective lines in a sealed manner, and which assumes its drawn-back rest position again when it is no longer loaded by pressure fluid. The device is particularly suitable if the relative position between supply connection and the receiver connection can vary within known tolerance limits.

<CLAIMS>
Device for temporarily connecting a source (52) 
of a compressed fluid, in particular compressed air, and 

a consumer element (49, 105), in particular a simple 
pneumatic actuator, having a supply connection (54, 95) 

and a receiving connection (76, 96), which are located 
opposite one another at least temporarily in a predetermined 

longitudinal direction (2, 85), and which are 
connected at least temporarily in each case to the source 

(52) of the compressed fluid and to the consumer element 
(49, 105), and having means for temporarily connecting 

the connections (54, 95, 76, 96), characterized in that 
the means for the temporary connection contain: 


in the case of the receiving connection (76, 96), an 
annular transverse surface (75, 97) which can be 

arranged located opposite the feed connection (54, 
95) and defines the orifice of an internal line (77, 

100) to the consumer element (49, 150), 
in the case of the supply connection (54, 95), a 
retractable connection in the form of a tubular 

piston (64, 89) which, opposite the annular 
transverse surface (75, 97) of the receiving connection 

(76, 96), has an annular transverse surface 
(68, 93) which defines the orifice of an internal 

line (65, 102) to the source (52) of the compressed 
fluid, the piston (64, 89) being arranged inside the 

supply connection (54, 95) so as to slide in the 
longitudinal direction with mutual sealing-off in 

such a way that it can move back and forth between 
an active position, with sealing contact of its 

annular transverse surface (68, 93) against the  
 

annular transverse surface (75, 97) of the receiving 
connection (76, 96) and with flow connection between 

the internal lines (65, 77, 100, 102), and a rest 
position in which the piston (64, 89) is by comparison 

retracted inside the supply connection (54, 
95), in which the annular transverse surfaces (68, 

75, 93, 97) are separated from one another, and in 
which the orifices of the internal lines (65, 77, 

100, 102) are subjected to the ambient pressure, the 
piston (64, 89) having transversely extending sections 

which are active in each case inside the 
supply connection (54, 95), but outside the supply 

connection (54, 95) in each case in communication 
with one of the internal lines (65, 77, 100, 102) 

and in the active position are subjected to the 
ambient pressure in such a way that the piston (64, 

89) moves from its rest position to the active 
position when it receives compressed fluid from the 

source (52), remains in the active position as long 
as it receives compressed fluid from the source 

(52), and returns to its rest position when it no 
longer receives compressed fluid from the source 

(52). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the retractable seal contains means (73) for the 

elastic return of the piston (64) from its active position 
to its rest position. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that at least one of the annular transverse 

surfaces (75, 93) is flat, and in that the other 
annular transverse surface (68, 97) has an annular seal 

(74, 51) which projects and which surrounds the associated 
orifice, and which is suitable likewise for 

surrounding the other orifice in the active position.
