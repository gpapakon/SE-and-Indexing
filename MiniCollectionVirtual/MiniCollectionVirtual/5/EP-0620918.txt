<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with devices which provide a detectable 
indication that a volume of gas has an increased proportion of carbon dioxide compared to 
that present in normal ambient air. Such devices have a number of uses, one major use 
being to provide an indication of whether a tube has been correctly located in the airway 
(trachea) of a patient. There are many clinical situations where it is necessary to place a tube in the 
trachea of a patient. This is done in order to supply air or a mixture of oxygen and other 
gases to the lungs of the patient. The correct placement of the tube in the trachea is very 
important. Accidents have been reported where the tube has been inadvertently placed in the 
oesophagus. It has been observed that the air in the trachea contains about 6% carbon 
dioxide, whereas the oesophagus contains air in which the concentration of carbon dioxide 
is normal (about 0.03%). Several indicator devices which can detect the presence of an elevated 
proportion of carbon dioxide compared to that in air are known. Our prior PCT application 
WO91/05252 discloses a carbon dioxide monitor comprising a substrate provided with a 
colorimetric indicating member. The indicating member is an intimate mixture of a 
transparent polymer vehicle and a salt of an indicator anion and a lipophilic cation. We have now devised a carbon dioxide detector provided with a fluorimetric 
sensing medium which is responsive to a carbon dioxide concentration in the proximal 
atmosphere. The inclusion of such fluorimetric media in a detector according to the present 
invention substantially enhances the sensitivity of such media in the detection of carbon 
dioxide. According to the present invention therefore there is provided a carbon dioxide 
detector which comprises an indicating member comprising an intimate mixture of a polymer 
vehicle and a carbon dioxide sensing medium comprising an anionic fluorimetric dye and a 
lipophilic organic quaternary cation. The response of the sensing medium to the level of carbon dioxide in the 
atmosphere involves the variation in the intensity of fluorescence emitted by the fluorimetric 
dye. The intensity of the fluorescence relies upon the fraction of the fluorimetric dye which  
 
is protonated which is in turn directly proportional to the carbon dioxide pressure. 
Protonation of the dye occurs via a reaction which involves both the lipophilic cation and the 
carbon dioxide as follows: 
 
where 
Q+ is the lipophilic cation, and D- is the fluorimetric
