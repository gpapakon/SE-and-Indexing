<ABSTRACT>
The resequencing device resequences information 
packets of an information stream transmitted from a 

transmitter station (IWU1) to a receiver station (IWU2) 
over a network (SMDS). This information stream includes 

first packets which may be received in the receiver station 
out of sequence with respect to each other or with respect 

to second packets which are always received in sequence. 
The network is for instance a Switched Multimegabit Data 

Service network where the first packets have a group 
address and are transmitted from the transmitter station to 

the receiver station and to other receiver stations (IWU2, 
IWU3) belonging to the same group, and the second packets 

have an individual address and are transmitted from the 
transmitter station to the receiver station. 
The transmitter station includes a counter 
circuit (C1) providing a counter value and a processing 

circuit (P1) which assigns the counter value to the second 
packets and the counter value incremented by one to the 

first packets. 
In this way the sequence numbers of the first 
packets form an ascending monotonous series and the second 

packets have sequence numbers equal to the sequence number 
of the preceding first packet. Based thereon the packets 

can easily be resequenced by a second processing circuit 
(P2) located in the receiver station, and which therefor 

uses a second counter circuit (C2), a timer (T) and a 
buffer (B).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for
resequencing information packets of an information packet
stream transmitted from a transmitter station to a receiver
station over a network and identified by sequence numbers.Such a method is well known in the art, e.g. from
the Euro-PCT Application No. 438415 (Henrion 17) Therein,
the network is a multipath self routing switch, so that
packets may follow different paths therein and may
therefore be out of sequence upon their arrival in the
receiver station. In this station the packets are then
resequenced based on sequence numbers constituted by time
stamps allocated to them in the transmitter station.This known resequencing method is however not
applicable when the information packet stream comprises two
or more types of intermixed packets which have to be in
sequence in the receiver station, not only within each type
they belong to but also with respect to each other. This
is for instance the case with a so called Switched
Multimegabit Data Service (SMDS) network as described in
the Bellcore specifications TR-TSV-000772 (corresponding
CCITT Draft Recommendation I364, Geneva, June 1992 or ETSI
final draft pr ETS 300217 September 1992 ) and wherein
packets belonging to a same information stream also called
session or message can be transmitted either as first
packets with group addresses from the transmitter station
to a plurality of receiver stations, including a
predetermined receiver station, via arbitrary paths, which
means that they can be received out of sequence in the
latter receiver station, or as second packets with
individual adresses from the transmitter station to the
predetermined receiver station where they are then received
in sequence. As all these packets, i.e. as well the first
as the second ones, belong to a same information stream,
the first packets have to be resequenced in the 
predetermined receiver station to be in sequence not only
with respect to themselves, but also with respect to the
second packets. Resequencing these first and second
packets with the help of sequence numbers or time stamps
allocated thereto as in known systems has the important
drawback that it is impossible to know upon receipt of a
sequence of first and second packets whether packets have
been lost, and thus whether one has to wait for those
possibly lost packets.Indeed, the transmitter station which is not
aware to which message a packet belongs,has to sequentially
allocate sequence numbers/time stamps to the packets it
sends out, without taking into
