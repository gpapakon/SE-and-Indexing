<ABSTRACT>
A threaded fastener (10) has an eccentric tip (16) with a smooth 
portion (26), a threaded portion (28) and a cleaning recess (30) 

formed into the 
threaded portion (28) of the tip (16). The recess (30) nd tip (16) 

are formed in 
the heading operation prior to rolling the threads onto the shank (14) 

which provides better thread quality.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to threaded fasteners and, 
more particularly, to anti-cross thread screws or fasteners with 
cleaning points. When a screw or bolt is screwed into a threaded nut or port, 
where the port is subjected to foreign materials such as dust, 
dirt, weld splatter, paint or the like, the foreign material is 
carried into the mating area between the external and internal 
threads as the screw or fastener is threaded into the port. If 
foreign material is carried into the threads, galling and/or 
seizing usually results during assembly. This galling and 
seizing of the bolts causes substantial down time during an 
assembly operation, since the seize fastener must be removed, the 
hole cleaned out and a replacement fastener installed. A common problem exists in the fastener field with cross 
threading. Cross threading generally occurs when the threaded 
fastener is received into a threaded nut or hole wherein the 
threads are in misalignment. Typical misalignments are axial and 
angular misalignments. In an axial misalignment, the axis of the 
shank of the screw is parallel with, but not colinear with, the 
axis of the receiving nut or hole. In an angular misalignment, 
the axis of the shank of the bolt is at an angle with respect to 
the axis of the nut or threaded hole. These misalignments cause 
the fasteners to be cross threaded and generally lead to seizing 
of the fasteners. The seizing causes a detrimental effect to  
 
both the bolt and nut, generally ruining one, the other or both, 
and causing little or no clamp load in the joint. U.S. Patent Number 4,952,110 illustrates an anti-cross 
threading screw. This fastener satisfactorily provides for 
anti-cross threading, but fails to provide a cleaning function. 
The present invention is an improvement over this patent. 
Accordingly, U.S. Patent No. 4,952,110, the specification and 
drawings, is expressly herein incorporated by reference. A traditional method of forming recesses or flutes onto a 
bolt is during the thread rolling operation. It requires a notch 
to be cut into the thread die, a fluter insert is positioned into 
the notch and as the part goes through the thread die, when it 
hits the fluter insert, it takes the form of the flute. A 
disadvantage in this type of method is that when the bolt goes 
through the thread die and hits the flute, it has a turbulent 
effect and the bolt wants to slip. A so-called drunken, thread 
or a poor quality thread can result from this condition. The method of the present invention

<CLAIMS>
A fastener comprising a head and a threaded shank 
projecting from said head, said shank having a desired 

radius, an arcuate peripheral surface, a substantially 
circular axial cross section and a tip at its axial end 

opposite said head, said tip comprised of a first portion 
having a surface with one or more partial threads, and a 

second portion having a smooth peripheral surface with its 
edge defining a curve with respect to the longitudinal 

axis, said first portion and second portion being continuous 
with one another and said tip including an axis being 

offset with respect to said shank axis, and a recess 
formed on said threaded first portion of said tip said 

recess for receiving foreign material. 
A fastener comprising a head and a threaded shank 
projecting from said head, said sh
ank having a desired 
radius, an arcuate peripheral surface, a substantially 

circular axial cross section and a tip at its axial end 
opposite said head, said tip comprised of a first portion 

having a surface with zero or one or more partial threads, 
the periphery of the one or more partial threads is on an 

arc substantially coincident and continuous with the 
peripheral arcuate surface of full threads on said shank 

such that a radius of said arc is substantially the same 
as said shank radius, and a second portion having a smooth 

peripheral surface with its edge defining a curve with 
respect to the longitudinal axis, said first portion and 

second portion being continuous with one another having a 
non-circular axial cross section and said tip including an 

axis begin offset with respect to said shank axis, and a 
recess formed on said threaded first portion of said tip 

said recess for receiving foreign material. 
The fastener according to claim 1 or 2, wherein said 
recess is at the end of said tip and extends through at 

least the first full thread on said shank. 
The fastener according to claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein said 
recess is positioned 180Â° from the center of the smooth 

portion of the tip. 
The fastener according to any one of the claims 1-4, 
wherein said recess has a width proportional to said shank 

diameter, preferably about 10% to 33% of the shank diameter. 
The fastener according to any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein said recess has an overall rectangular or 

elliptical shape. 
A method of manufacturing a fastener comprising forming 
a blank having a head and an unthreaded shank, forming 

said blank into a header die means, forming a tip having a 
smooth peripheral surface with its edge defining a curve 

with respect to a longitudinal axis and a recess in said 
tip opposing said smooth peripheral surface, forming 

threads on said shank and on said tip opposite said smooth 
peripheral surface such that said recess extends from said 

tip through at least a first full thread. 
The method according to claim 7, further comprising 
forming said recess to have an overall rectangular or 

elliptical shape. 
The method according to claim 7 or 8, further forming 
said recess in said shank and tip with a unifom depth. 
The method according to claim 7, 8 or 9, wherein said 
recess width has a size equal to about 10% or 33% of the 

diameter of said shank.
