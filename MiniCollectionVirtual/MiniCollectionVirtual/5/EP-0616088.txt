<ABSTRACT>
In order to configure planar or three-dimensional floor-type grids comprising bars and junction pieces in a more cost-effective manner, the supports (11) and junction pieces (14) exhibit an identical, longitudinally slit profile, e.g. a cross-shaped profile. The supports (11) can thus, in their connection region, replace the junction pieces (14). The floor-type-grid flange bars (12, 13) produced from rectangular profile tubes are connected to the junction pieces (14) and supports (11) by clamping closures which each exhibit two clamping jaws which can be braced into slots of the junction pieces (14) and bars (12, 13).

Planar or spatial ceiling grid made of bars and nodal 
pieces, in particular a ceiling grid that can be 

walked on, with supports which carry the said ceiling 
grid, wherein the supports and the nodal pieces have 

an identical, longitudinally slotted profile and the 
supports, in their connecting region, replace the 

nodal pieces, and the boom bars of the ceiling grid 
are connected at the nodal pieces and supports by 

connecting elements fastened in their slots,
characterised in that
 
the connecting elements are constructed as wedging 

closures (18 to 22) which are braced for wedging 
against side walls of the longitudinal slots (24). 
Ceiling grid according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the supports (11) and nodal pieces (14) have a 

polygonal profile, a cross-type profile, or some other 
multi-arm or multi-web profile. 
Ceiling grid according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the nodal pieces (14) are supplemented, on one 

end face, by nodal segments (28) with threaded bores 
for the screwed connection of diagonal bars (15) 

belonging to a spatial ceiling grid (10). 
Ceiling grid according to claim 3, characterised in 
that the nodal segments (28) are disposed so as to be 

rotatable and lockable in position in relation to the 
nodal pieces (14). 
Ceiling grid according to claim 3, characterised in 
that the nodal segment (28) is joined to the nodal 

piece (14) by means of a screw (30) extending through 
central bores (29, 32) in the nodal piece (14) and in 

a top plate (31).  
 
Ceiling grid according to claim 5, characterised in 
that the screw (30) joining the nodal piece (14) to 

the nodal segment (28) is prolonged upwards (51) and 
at the same time serves for fastening a bar, for 

example a handrail bar (46), standing on the ceiling 
grid (10). 
Ceiling grid according to claim 5, characterised in 
that the top plate (31) is provided with four holding 

pins (33), which are disposed in the shape of a cross, 
for floor panels (16) which are to be laid on the 

ceiling grid (10) and which have corresponding 
recesses (34) for receiving the holding pins (33). 
Ceiling grid according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the boom bars (12) of the ceiling grid (10; 110) 

are additionally superposed on the nodal pieces (14) 
and supports (11). 
Ceiling grid according to claim 1 or 8, characterised 
in that the wedging closures have, in each case, two 

wedging jaws (19) which are mounted for rotation about 
vertical spindles in the ends of the boom bars (12), 

are held together by a spring (22) in their 
inoperative starting position and can be spread apart, 

by an adjusting screw (25), into their operative 
position in which the outer profiled ends (21) of the 

wedging jaws (19) engage, in a positive-locking and 
non-positive-locking manner, in the correspondingly 

profiled slots (24) in the nodal pieces (14) and 
supports (11). 
Ceiling grid according to one of claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that the supports (11) terminate, at 

their upper ends, with the upper side of the ceiling 
grid (10, 110, 210).  

 
Ceiling grid according to one of claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that the supports (11) protrude above 

the ceiling grid (310) with their upper ends (41) in a 
pylon-like manner. 
Ceiling grid according to claim 11, characterised in 
that bracing is provided between the upper ends (41) 

of the supports (11) and the ceiling grid (310) by 
means of cables (42). 
Ceiling grid according to one of claims 1 to 12, 
characterised in that the ceiling grid (210, 310) 

consists of lattice-carrier elements (37) which are 
connected on edge at the supports (11) and nodal 

pieces (14 ), the length of which essentially 
corresponds to the structural height of the said 

lattice-carrier elements (37). 
Ceiling grid according to claim 13,
 
   characterised in that the gaps between the 

lattice-carrier elements (37) are filled up by 
closing-off elements, for example sails or membranes 

made of textile material. 
Ceiling grid according to one of claims 1 to 14, 
characterised in that wall elements (36) can be 

inserted underneath the ceiling grid (110) in the 
longitudinal slots (24), which are located opposite 

one another, of adjacent supports (11). 
Ceiling grid according to one of claims 1 to 14, 
characterised in that connecting profiles (60) for 

wall elements (36') can be wedged into the 
longitudinal slots (24) of the supports (11"), 

underneath the ceiling grid.
