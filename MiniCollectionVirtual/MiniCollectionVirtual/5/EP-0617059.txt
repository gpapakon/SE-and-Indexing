<ABSTRACT>
Polymers having amine-thiol terminal moieties are provided. The amine-thiol terminal 
moieties are imparted by using amine-thiols as chain transfer agents in aqueous addition 

polymerizations. 
The polymers are useful as mineral dispersants, as water-treatment additives for boiler 
waters, cooling towers, reverse osmosis applications, sugar refining, paper production, geothermal 

processes and oil wells, and as detergent additives acting as builders, anti-filming agents, 
dispersants, sequestering agents and encrustation inhibitors.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to amine-thiol chain transfer agents. In particular, this
invention relates to the use of amine-thiols in aqueous addition polymerizations.It is frequently desirable to control the molecular weight of polymer mixtures.
Low molecular weight polymers have a weight average molecular weight (Mw)
below 50,000. Low molecular weight polymers are useful, for example, as mineral
dispersants, as water-treatment additives for boiler waters, cooling towers, reverse
osmosis applications, sugar refining, paper production, geothermal processes and oil
wells, and as detergent additives acting as builders, anti-filming agents, dispersants,
sequestering agents and encrustation inhibitors.One method of achieving low molecular weight polymers is by utilizing
increased amounts of initiators. Attempting to produce low molecular weight
polymers by increasing the amount of initiator is problematic. This approach adds
considerably to the cost of production and may result in polymer chain degradation,
crosslinking, and high levels of unreacted initiator remaining in the product.The use of high levels of metal ions has also been tried as a means for
producing low molecular weight polymers. This approach suffers from increased
cost and has associated with it serious health and environmental concerns. In
addition, the product is usually discoloured by the metal ions.DE 2051317 discloses an aqueous process of polymerizing monomers or
monomer mixtures with free radical forming initiators in the presence of amine-thiols
as molecular weight regulators. However the process described is firstly, very
slow and secondly this prior art does not teach a method of producing polymers with
an amine-sulfide terminal moiety comprising an amino acid or a derivative, a
peptide or polypeptide and one or more thiols.FR-A-2399448 discloses latices of vinyl polymers containing carboxylic and/or
sulphonate groups and with

end groups. Again there is no teaching in this document of polymers with an amine
sulfide terminal moiety comprising an amino acid or a derivative, a peptide or
polypeptide and one or more thiols.Another method of achieving low molecular weight polymers is by utilizing one
or more chain transfer agents during the polymerization. The use of 2-mercaptoethyl
ammonium chloride as a chain transfer agent in free-radical polymerizations was
disclosed in Polymer, Vol. 14, November 1973, pages 587-588 by DeBoos. DeBoos 
disclosed solvent-based homopolymerizations of styrene, methyl methacrylate, butyl
methacrylate,
