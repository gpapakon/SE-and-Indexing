<ABSTRACT>
A data for contactless communication with the coding and/or reading station of an access, identification and/or control system has as power supply two electrically independent current sources (5). The first current source (5), which supplies the liquid crystal display (4) and a device (29) for viewing the content of the memory, is arranged in the data carrier. The second current source is incorporated in the coding and/or reading station and supplies the transceiver logic (30) and the memory (27) in a contactless manner during communication wiht the coding and reading station.

<CLAIMS>
A data carrier for use in access, identification and/or 
checking systems, comprising a data transmitting-receiving unit (30) for 

communication with at least one encoding and/or reading station, a nonvolatile, 
electrically erasable and programmable memory (27), a 

transmitting-receiving logic which writes the data into the memory (27) 
and reads them out of the memory (27), a liquid crystal display (4), a 

means (29) for displaying the data contained in the memory (27) on the 
liquid crystal display (4), and a power supply means which has a power 

source (5, 6) arranged in the data carrier, characterised in that the 
power supply means comprises two electrically mutually independent 

portions of which the first portion is the power source (5, 6) which is 
arranged in the data carrier, that the liquid crystal display (4) and 

the means (29) for displaying the memory content are connected to the 
first portion of the power supply means, and that the second portion of 

the power supply means is formed by a contact-less transmission element 
(28) which is associated with the transmitting-receiving logic and the 

memory (27), for receiving energy from a second power source provided in 
the encoding and/or reading station. 
A data carrier according to claim 1 characterised in that the 
contact-less transmission element includes a magnetic coil (28). 
A data carrier according to claim 1 or claim 2 characterised in 
that the first portion of the power supply means includes a solar cell 

(5). 
A data carrier according to claim 3 characterised in that it is 
in the form of a disk (3) wherein the liquid crystal display (4) and the 

solar cell (5) are arranged at the one side of the disk (3) and a 
spirally arranged antenna (11) of the data transmitting-receiving unit 

(30) is printed on the disk (3) at the second side thereof.  
 
A data carrier according to claim 4 characterised in that the 
two sides of the disk (3) are covered wi
th a protective foil (36, 37) 
wherein the protective foil (36) has a respective window (42) in the 

region of each of the liquid crystal display (4) and the solar cell (5). 
A data carrier according to claim 4 or claim 5 characterised in 
that the periphery of the disk (3) is bordered by a metallic ring (40) 

which is interrupted by a slot. 
A data carrier according to one of claims 1 to 6 characterised 
in that the data carrier is fitted into a holding means (1, 12) which 

has a cord (31) which can be pulled out of a spring coil (13). 
A data carrier according to claim 2 and claim 7 characterised 
in that arranged in the holding means (1, 12) as an antenna extension is 

the magnetic coil (28) which connects to an exposed contact of the 
antenna (11).
