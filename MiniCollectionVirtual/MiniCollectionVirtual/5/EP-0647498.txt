<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for machining a workpiece using a laser beam, in the course of which a coating which increases the absorption factor of the surface for the laser beam is applied to the workpiece surface to be machined. According to the invention, an organic, combustible gas or gas mixture is burnt, in the course of which the carbon particles produced by the combustion form the absorption-increasing coating on the workpiece surface. The combustion flame of the fuel gas or fuel-gas mixture is advantageously directed by means of a burner onto the surface to be coated. Acetylene is preferably used as the organic fuel gas. The fuel-gas mixture, apart from the organic fuel gas, advantageously receives a gas containing oxygen, such as air, air enriched with oxygen, or pure oxygen. The process according to the invention can be used especially advantageously in laser beam hardening, laser beam remelting and laser beam cutting.

<CLAIMS>
Method for processing a workpiece using laser 
radiation, in which the surface of the workpiece to be 

processed is given a coating which increases the level of 
absorption of the surface for the laser radiation, 

characterised in that an organic combustible gas or gas 
mixture is burnt and the absorption-increasing coating is 

formed on the surface of the workpiece by accumulation of 
the carbon particles produced during combustion. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the combustion flame of the combustible gas or 

combustible gas mixture is directed at the surface to be 
coated by means of a burner. 
Method according to claim 2, characterised in that a 
distance of between 50 and 500 mm, preferably between 100 

and 400 mm, is set between the burner and the surface of 
the workpiece to be coated. 
Method according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that acetylene and/or another organic 

combustible gas is used as the organic combustible gas. 
Method according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that in addition to the organic 

combustible gas, the combustible gas mixture contains a 
gas containing oxygen such as air, air enriched with 

oxygen or pure oxygen. 
Method according to claim 5, characterised in that 
the combustible gas mixture has an oxygen content of 1 to 

5 mol%. 
Method according to claim 5, characterised in that 
the combustible gas mixture contains between 5 and 10% by 

volume of air. 
Method according to one of claims 2 to 7, 
characterised in that the control of the burner is  

 
coupled to the control of the laser processing 

installation. 
Method according to one of claims 2 to 8, 
characterised in that a burner matching the contour of 

the workpiece is used. 
Method according to one of claims 2 to 9, 
characterised in that a coating with a specific geometric 

shape is produced on the surface of the workpiece by 
means of covers and masks. 
Use of the method according to one of claims 1 to 10 
for laser beam hardening, laser beam remelting, laser 

beam cutting, engraving and inscription of workpieces.
