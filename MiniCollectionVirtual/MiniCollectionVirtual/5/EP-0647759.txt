<ABSTRACT>
A wood-aluminium frame comprises a seal 
(13, 20) provided with coupling means (14, 15, 21) 

for engaging counter-means (16, 17, 21, 22) 
provided in the aluminium profiled sections (3, 9) 

and/or in the wood profiled sections (4, 10) 
between which the seal (13, 20) is clamped.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates very 
generally to a so-called wood-aluminum frame, that 
is, frames consisting of aluminium profiled 
sections and of wood profiled sections connected 
to one another by coupling systems including those 
of the detachable type. As is known, frames of the above-mentioned 
type have been well-accepted on the 
market since they have characteristics of strength 
and reliability together with an acknowledged 
aesthetic appearance. A rigid insert which is flattened to a 
greater or lesser extent and is incorrectly known 
as a seal, produced from a suitable heat-insulating 
material, provided so as to form 
thermal insulation between the wood and the metal 
is conventionally located between the coupled 
profiled sections, both of the fixed sash and of 
the movable sash of the frame. One or more true seals, produced from 
elasto-plastic, flexible material (rubber and  
 
similar plastic materials) are, on the other hand, 
operationally provided between the fixed sash and 
the movable sash and extend peripherally relative 
to the frame. Generally, a first seal is peripherally 
associated with the fixed sash and, in particular, 
with the metal profiled sections of this sash and 
is constructed and dimensioned so as to cooperate 
with a corresponding abutment stop, in turn 
provided peripherally in the metal profiled 
sections of the movable frame. A second seal is associated peripherally 
with the movable sash, in particular between the 
wood and metal profiled sections thereof from 
which it projects for a portion having a shape and 
size such that it can abut the wood profiled 
sections of the fixed sash over the entire 
periphery thereof. There is a disadvantage hitherto not 
overcome with respect to the second seal and more 
precisely to its position between the wood and 
aluminium profiled sections. In fact, in the 
assembly position (coupling) of the components of 
the movable sash, the latter is simply positioned 
in contact with the aluminum profiled sections,  
 
for example, on which the corresponding wood 
profiled sections are then secured. With this 
type of securing, the above-mentioned seal, or 
rather, a specific part thereof, is clamped 
between the wood and aluminum profiled sections. During the above securing process, the 
seal is subject to movements which, even though 
very small, bring about an off-centring of the 
seal which is unacceptable to the point where the 
"work" has to be repeated, resulting in lost time 
and money. On the other hand, the attention

<CLAIMS>
Wood-aluminium frame comprising a movable 
sash and a fixed sash, each of which is formed by 

aluminium profiled sections and wood profiled 
sections coupled to one another by known means, 

and at least one seal clamped between the profiled 
sections, extending on at least one side of the 

movable and fixed sashes, characterised in that 
the seal (13, 20) is provided with detachable 

coupling means (14, 15, 21) with counter-coupling 
means (16, 17, 21, 22), provided in the aluminium 

profiled sections (3, 9) and/or in the wood 
profiled sections (4, 10), along the at least one 

side of the movable and fixed sashes. 
Frame according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that the coupling means (14, 15, 21) of the 

seal (13, 20) consist of a bead having a cross-section 
substantially in the shape of a mushroom, 

the counter-means (16, 17, 21, 22) consisting of 
respective grooves formed in the aluminium 

profiled sections (3, 9) and wood profiled 
sections (4, 10) and having cross-sections 

substantially matched to the cross-section of the 
bead. 
Seal for the sash of wood-aluminium 
frames, characterised in that it is provided on at 

least one face with a bead extending over at least 
part of the length of the seal.
