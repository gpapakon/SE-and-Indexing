<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a new coupling and to a new fuel
dispensing system or a new hose assembly that comprises
the new coupling.It is known to provide a fuel dispensing
system comprising a fuel dispensing hozzle
construction having an outer fuel receiving inlet
end an inner vapor outlet, a fuel dispensing pump
construction having an outer fuel dispensing outlet
and an inner vapor inlet, and a hose assembly
having a first fluid passage therein for conveying
fuel from said outer fuel dispensing outlet to said
outer fuel receiving inlet and a second fluid
passage therein for returning vapors from the inner
vapor outlet to the inner vapor inlet, the hose
assembly comprising a flexible inner hose having an
outer peripheral surface and defining an inner
fluid passage therein and a flexible outer hose
having an inner peripheral surface and being
disposed around the inner hose, the innet
peripheral surface of the outer hose and the outer
peripheral surface of the inner hose defining an
outer fluid passage therebetween, the inner fluid
passage comprising the second fluid passage and the
outer fluid passage comprising the first fluid
passage. For example, see FIG. 28 of the drawings
of this patent application.It is also known to provide a fuel
dispensing system comprising a fuel dispensing
nozzle construction having an inner fuel receiving 
inlet and an outer vapor outlet, a fuel dispensing
pump construction having an inner fuel dispensing
outlet and an outer vapor inlet, and a hose
assembly having a first fluid passage therein for
conveying fuel from the inner fuel dispensing
outlet to the inner fuel receiving inlet and a
second fluid passage therein for returning vapors
from the outer vapor outlet to the outer vapor
inlet, the hose assembly comprising a flexible
inner hose having an outer peripheral surface and
defining an inner fluid passage therein, and a
flexible outer hose having an inner peripheral
surface and being disposed around the inner hose,
the inner peripheral surface of the outer hose and
the outer peripheral surface of the inner hose
defining an outer fluid passage therebetween, the
inner fluid passage comprising the first fluid
passage and the outer fluid passage comprising the
second fluid passage. For example, see the U.S.
patent to Basham, No. 3,980,112, and the U.S.
patent to Grantham, No. 4,951,720.It is one feature of this invention
to utilize a hose assembly that is normally
utilized to return vapors through an inner hose
thereof and to convey fuel through the outer
passage thereof
