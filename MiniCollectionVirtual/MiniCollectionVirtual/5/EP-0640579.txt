<ABSTRACT>
An optically active 5-methylenedioxolan-4-one 
derivative is subjected to Diels-Alder reaction with 

cyclopentadiene, and the resulting Diels-Alder reaction 
product is hydrolyzed to convert it into an optically 

active 2-hydroxynorbornene-2-carboxylic acid, which is 
then subjected to catalytic hydrogenation to form an 

optically active 2-hydroxynorbornane-2-carboxylic acid. 
The hydroxycarboxylic acid is subjected to oxidative 

decarboxylation to obtain an optically active 2-norbornanone.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for producing an
optically active 2-norbornanone useful as a starting
material for synthesizing various physiologically active
substances.A thromboxane A2 receptor antagonist useful as a
blood coagulator can be synthesized from an optically
active 3-allyl-2-norbornanone, as reported in Narisada et
al., J. Med. Chem., 31, 1847 (1988).This optically active 3-allyl-2-norbornanone is
usually produced by allylating the α-position of a
carbonyl group of optically active 2-norbornanone. Hence,
in the production of the thromboxane A2 receptor
antagonist, it is necessary to obtain optically active 2-norbornanone.The following three processes have been hitherto
proposed as processes for producing the optically active 2-norbornanone.A first process comprises reacting a racemic
modification of endo- or exo-2-norbornanol with phthalic 
anhydride to form a half ester of phthalic acid,
subjecting it to optical resolution by a diastereomer
method, and hydrolyzing the resolution product, further
followed by oxidation to obtain optically active 2-norbornanone
[Winstein et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 74,
1147, (1952)].A second process comprises subjecting a racemic
modification of exo-2-norbornanol or 2-norbornanone to
asymmetric oxidation or asymmetric reduction,
respectively, using horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase to
obtain optically active 2-norbornanone [Irwin et al., J.
Am. Chem. Soc., 98, 8476, (1976)].A third process comprises subjecting an optically
active acrylic ester and cyclopentadiene to Diels-Alder
reaction to obtain an optically active norbornene-2-carboxylic
acid ester, hydrolyzing the resulting ester,
and subjecting the resulting optically active norbornene-2-carboxylic
acid to catalytic hydrogenation to obtain
optically active norbornane-2-carboxylic acid, further
followed by oxidation to convert it into optically active
2-hydroxynorbornane-2-carboxylic acid, which is finally
subjected to oxidative decarboxylation to obtain optically
active 2-norbornanone (Japanese Patent Application Laid-open
No. 5-51345).However, in the case of the first process, the 
optically active 2-norbornanone obtained can not have a
sufficient optical purity. In order to improve its
optical purity, complicated operations for purification
such as recrystallization must be repeated, resulting in a
decrease in yield of the optically active 2-norbornanone
and inversely an increase in production cost. Thus, there
is a problem in the industrial application of the process.In the case of the second
