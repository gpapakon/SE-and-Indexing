<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a tanning apparatus which comprises a couch, an illuminator and, where appropriate, a face tanning apparatus which form a tanning tunnel, UV radiation being transmitted from the interior of the couch, of the illuminator and, where appropriate, of the face tanning apparatus, into the tanning tunnel. This tanning device is to be improved in such a way that there is hardly any waste heat on the body, it does not necessitate cooling of the apparatus and manages with a reduced connected load. This is achieved in that there is a central radiation generator which is arranged remote from the radiation emergence surfaces delimiting the tanning tunnel, and in that the central radiation generator is connected to the interior of the couch, of the illuminator and, where appropriate, of the face tanning apparatus via fibre optical waveguides which project from the wall sections of the couch, the illuminator and, where appropriate, the face tanning apparatus, opposite the radiation emergence surfaces, each end of the fibre optical waveguides being allocated to a device which causes the emerging bundle of rays to be distributed over a large surface area with uniform distribution of the radiation.

Tanning apparatus comprising a couch (2), a flooding cover 
(3) and, optionally, a facial tanner (4), forming a tanning 

tunnel (5), wherein UV radiation is transmitted from the 
interior of the couch (2), the flooding cover (3) and, 

optionally, the facial tanner (4) into the tanning tunnel (5) 
and a central radiation generator (6) is provided which is 

arranged at a distance from the radiation emission surfaces 
(2b, 3b, 4b) delimiting the tanning tunnel (5), and wherein 

the central radiation generator (6) is connected to the 
interior (2a, 3a, 4a) of the couch (2), the flooding cover (3) 

and, optionally, the facial tanner (4) by light wave guides 
(7a, 7b, 7c), characterised in that the light wave guides (7a, 

7b, 7c) project from the wall regions of the couch (2), the 
flooding cover (3) and, optionally, the facial tanner (4) 

opposite the radiation emission surfaces (2b, 3b, 4b), the end 
of each light wave guide being associated with a device 

which produces large-area propagation of the emergent 
beam with uniform distribution of the radiation. 
Tanning apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the device is formed as a reflector unit. 
Tanning apparatus according to claim 2, characterised in 
that the reflector unit comprises a main reflector (8) and a 

counter reflector (10). 
Tanning apparatus according to claim 3, characterised in 
that the main reflector (8) is curved and its concave surface 

faces the radiation emission surface (2a, 3a, 4a).  
 
Tanning apparatus according to claims 3 and 4, 
characterised in that the passage point (9) of the light wave 

guide (7a, 7b, 7c) through the main reflector (8) is arranged 
on the optical axis thereof. 
Tanning apparatus according to claims 3 to 5, characterised 
in that the counter reflector (10) is arranged in the space 

enclosed by the main reflector (8), is curved and its convex 
surface faces the main reflector (8). 
Tanning apparatus according to claim 6, characterised in 
that the counter reflector (10) is arranged on the optical axis 

of the main reflector (8) opposite the passage point (9) of 
the light wave guide (7a, 7b, 7c). 
Tanning apparatus according to claim 7, characterised in 
that the counter reflector (10) is arranged in or near the 

focal point of the main reflector (8). 
Tanning apparatus according to claim 3 and at least one of 
the succeeding claims, characterised in that a lens is 

provided between the main reflector (8) and the counter 
reflector (10) at the end of the light wave guide (7a, 7b, 7c). 
Tanning apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the device is formed as a lens system. 
Tanning apparatus according to claim 3 and at least one of 
the succeeding claims, characterised in that the space in 

the couch (2) is filled with a gel, the said space being 
enclosed by the main reflector (8) and the radiation 

emission surface (2b), and the radiation emission surface 
(2b) is formed as a transparent, formable film.
