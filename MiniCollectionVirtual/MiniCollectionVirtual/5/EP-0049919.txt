<ABSTRACT>
The device is connected between a volume meter (1) connected to a fluid source, and an electronic counter (2). Pref. the meter is of a rotor type having a magnet disc. The meter hence gives out an electrical pulse for each given displacement of fluid. An n-bit memory (3) having a clock input (CLK) is connected to the pulse output of the volume meter. The memory data output is connected to a first input of an adder (4). The sum output of the adder is connected to a data input of the adder. A second input of the adder is connected to an n-bits setting member (5). A pulse former (6) is connected to the adder carry output (c) to retain the carry signal and apply an output to the indicating device. The volume meter further supplies a temp signal, which is applied to the setting member. The latter has temp. compensating device. The temp. signal is used for correcting the setting of the n-bits setting member. The indicator displays the dispensation of a second given volume unit of fluid after each reception of a pulse.

<DESCRIPTION>

 Digital adaptation and setting device to be connected between a
 volume meter and a digital indication device.


 The invention relates to a digital adaption and setting device to be connected between a volume meter and a digital indicating device, said volume meter being connected to a fluid source and producing, when fluid is dispensed, after each displacement of a first given fluid unit, a pulse at an electric output and said indicating device, after each reception of a   a   pulse at an input thereof, indicating the dispensing of a second given fluid unit.


 The present invention particularly   relatesto    fuel supply devices comprising an electronic counter, though it is not limited thereto.


 An adaptation device is required when the number of pulses supplied by the volume meter, after the dispensation of a given amount of fluid, differs from the number of pulses required by an indicating device for displaying the given amount of fluid dispensed. The number of pulses supplied by the volume meter in the above-mentioned case may exceed the number of pulses required by the enunciator at the output to display the dispensed amount of fluid. A logic solution of this problem would be a divider. A first disad  vantage of this solution is that the result lags behing so that when the dispensation of an amount of fluid is stopped, the indicating device does not display the correct amount. A second disadvantage is that the adaptation can be corrected only with difficulty as may be required, for example, by the weights and measures office.
For fuel, for example, an accuracy of setting of   1 /on    may be required.


 The invention has for its object to obviate these disadvantages and provided to this end a device of the kind set forth, which is characterized by comprising: a n bits memory, whose clock input is connected to the pulse generating output of the volume meter and whose data output is connected to a first input of a n bits adding member, the sum output of which is connec ted to   thb    data input of the memory, a second input being connected to a n -bits setting and the carry signal output being connected through a pulse forming member to the input of the indicating device. In this way it is ensured that the calculated number of output pulses of the adaptation and setting device is correct at any instant.


 Since, particularly in the case of fuel delivery, the fluid volume unit generating a pulse at an electric output of the volume meter will appreaciably vary with temperature, a preferred
