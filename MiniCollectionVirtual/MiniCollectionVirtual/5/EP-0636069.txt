<ABSTRACT>
The inner rearview mirror of a motor vehicle is provided with a glove box (860) arranged behind the rearview mirror (850). At its lower side (861), the glove box (860) has an opening (863) closable by a lid (862). A holder (900) for receiving objects to be stowed away is movably linked to the glove box (860). The holder (900) may be moved between an inner locking position, in which it is substantially enclosed in the glove box (860), and an outer locking position located underneath the rearview mirror (850), in which the objects may be placed into or removed from the holder (900). When a lock (870) is loosened, the holder (900) is moved from the inner to the outer locking position under the force of springs (875, 876). The holder (900) may be designed as a container for receiving various objects or with a special receptacle (800) for defined objects, such as spectacles. Instead of movable objects to be stowed away, operating elements or display devices of the motor vehicle may also be permanently built into the holder (900), so that they may be drawn out of the glove box (860) for use.
