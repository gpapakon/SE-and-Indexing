<ABSTRACT>
A fuel injection nozzle (1) for internal combustion engines has injection holes (4) with a continuously variable cross-section. The injection cross-section can be continuously varied by means of two adjustable components (2, 3) of the nozzle body located opposite each other and which together delimit the injection holes (4). The adjustment mechanism is independent from the movement of the nozzle needle (5). Consequently, the back-and-forth movement of the nozzle needle (5) and the adjustment of the injection cross-section do not affect each other. The adjusted position can be maintained for the whole duration of the injection. The jet can thus be formed without disturbances during the whole injection process. An easy-to-manufacture design of the nozzle body consists of components (2, 3) whose angular position can be adjusted with respect to each other and which have sawtoothshaped circumferential surfaces which rest upon each other.
