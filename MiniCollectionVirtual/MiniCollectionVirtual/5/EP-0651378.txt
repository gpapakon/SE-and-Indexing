<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magnetic recording
medium suited for high-density recording.In the magnetic recording media such as VTR tapes,
audio tapes and computer tapes, the necessity is rising
recently for higher recording density in order to satisfy
the requests for higher performance, longer recording time
and smaller lightweight. Shortening of recording
wavelength is essential for realizing high-density
recording, but when the magnetic layer has a greater
thickness than a certain level in relation to the recording
wavelength, the flux of the magnetic substance in the deep
layer is unable to pass the head and consequently forms a
closed loop. Thus, this magnetic flux turns up a loss,
since it does not pass the head core. In principle,
therefore, the shorter the recording wavelength is, the
smaller should be the thickness of the magnetic layer.In line with this concept, there has been developed a
so-called ME (metal evaporation)-type magnetic recording
medium in which the recording layer is strikingly reduced
in thickness by vapor depositing or sputtering a
ferromagnetic metal in order to realize a remarkable
reduction of the thickness loss resulting from shortening
of recording wavelength. This ME-type magnetic recording 
medium, however, is at a disadvantage in that the thin
ferromagnetic metal film composed of cobalt, nickel or a
mixture thereof as magnetic substance tends to rust.
Although various improvements have been made, such magnetic
recording medium still lacks reliability for the long-time
retention of recordings.In the case of using MP (metal powder)-type magnetic
recording medium in which a magnetic substance of a
ferromagnetic metal dispersed in a resin binder is coated
on a base film, it is relatively easy to cope with rusting,
for instance, the rusting can be prevented by forming an
anti-oxidant film on the metal particle surfaces. However,
in the case of using the coating-type magnetic recording
media, certain problems in production such as formation of
pinholes or streaks, tend to arise when the thickness of
the magnetic layer is reduced. It is also a hindrance to
thickness reduction of the magnetic layer that the packing
ratio of the magnetic substance can not be increased
because of using a resin binder containing various
additives.For overcoming these disadvantages of the coating-type
magnetic recording media, there has been proposed a
magnetic recording medium in which a magnetic layer
composed of two layers is coated on the base film, the
lower non-magnetic layer being
