<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a support element (1) for a longitudinally horizontally running wall protection means, comprising a plurality of board-like wall protection elements (20), there being provided, on the support element (1), fastening bores (23) for fastening screws, to be inserted into wall-side dowels, and devices for attachment of the wall protection elements (20) by vertical pushing-in. In order to simplify assembly and to reduce the assembly parts, the fastening elements remaining invisible, the configuration is such that the upper end (2) of the support element (1) is bent off to the front with respect to the assembled state, and a tube portion (4) is fastened at the upper end (2) of the bent-off portion (3), it being possible to fasten in the region of the fastening bores (23), at the lower end (7) of the support element (1), a spacer part (8), at whose end which is in the front in the assembled state there are formed undercuts (groove 11) and protrusions for the pushing-in of corresponding protrusions (17) and undercuts, respectively, of a retaining part (16) which can be connected to the respective wall protection element (20), and a vertical stop (12) being formed on the underside of the spacer parts (8).
