<ABSTRACT>
An electrical terminal (2) comprises a mating portion 
(4), a wire connecting portion (6) and a lead strain 

relief portion (8). The lead connecting portion (6) 
comprises insulation slitting edges (36) and indents (28) 

for penetrating the insulation of an insulated lead (L) to 
make electrical connection with the metal core (C) of the 

lead (L). The lead strain relief portion (8) comprises 
three ears (52, 54) upstanding from respective sidewalls 

(48, 50) projecting from opposite edges a base (46). Each 
ear (52, 54) is formed with triangular shaped barb (56) 

projecting inwardly of the strain relief portion (8) and 
having a sharp edge (58) from which extends an end edge 

(59) facing the wire connecting portion (6). The base (46) 
of the strain relief portion (8) has a quadrangular array 

of spurs (60) having sharp apices (62) projecting into the 
strain relief portion (8).The ears (52, 54) can be crimped 

about the insulation of the lead (L) when it has been 
forced into the wire connecting portion (6) so that the 

barbs (56) and the spurs (60) bite into the insulation of 
the lead (L) thereby preventing axial movement of the lead 

(L) away from the wire connecting portion (6) when tension 
is applied to the lead (L), so that the electrical 

connections between the indents (28) and the lead core (C) 
are unimpaired.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electrical terminal according to the precharacterizing
part of claim 1. Such tenninals are suitable for use in the
automotive industry.There is described in DE-U-8608199.3 an electrical
terminal having a longitudinal axis and comprising a
mating portion, a wire connecting portion connected to one
end of the mating portion and a lead strain relief portion
connected to the opposite end of the wire connecting
portion, the wire connecting portion being adapted to make
electrical connection to the metal core of an insulated
electrical lead and the lead strain relief portion
comprising a base and upstanding ears adapted to be
crimped about the insulation of the lead to restrain axial
movement of the lead away from the wire connecting
portion.When crimped to the insulation of the lead, the ears
of the lead strain relief portion serve to grip the lead
in order to protect the electrical connection between the
core of the lead and the wire connecting portion when a
tensile force is applied to the lead in a direction away
from the wire connecting portion. Such terminals are
commonly used in the automotive industry in insulating
housings which are adapted to mate with corresponding
insulating housing for mating electrical connectors. When
an automotive vehicle is being serviced, there is a
standing temptation for the service mechanic to disconnect
one electrical connector from another by pulling upon the
leads of the terminals of the one connector. Especially
where the housings of mating connectors are difficult to
disengage, the tensile force applied to a lead may well
impair its electrical connection with the terminal from
which the lead extends. The lead strain relief protection
afforded by the lead strain relief portion of the known
terminal described above, is solely dependent upon the 
frictional engagement between the ears of the lead strain
relief portion and the insulation of the lead.In accordance with the pre-characterizing part of claim 1, US-A-3,335,392
discloses an electrical terminal having ear-like ferrule forming
portions including prongs. A plurality of lugs (barb means) are struck
from the prongs.The object of the present invention is to provide for an electrical
terminal of the type defined in the pre-characterizing part of claim 1,
wherein the barb means serve to further increase the resistance of the
lead to being pulled away from the wire connecting portion of the
terminal.This is achieved by the characterizing features of claim 1.For reinforcement of each barb in

<CLAIMS>
An electrical terminal (2) having a longitudinal axis (X-X) and
comprising a mating portion (4), a wire connection portion (6)

connected at one end to the mating portion (4) and a lead strain
relief portion (8) connected to the opposite end of the wire connecting

portion (6), and being adapted to make electrical connection to
the metal core (C) of an insulated electrical lead (L), and the lead

strain relief portion (8) comprising a base (46) and upstanding ears
(52, 54) projecting away from the base (46) and adapted to be

crimped about the insulation of the lead (L) to restrain axial

movement of the lead (L) away from the wire connection portion
(6); wherein each ear (52, 54) is formed with barb means (56)

projecting inwardly of the strain relief portion, and being adapted to
bite into the insulation of the lead (L) when the ears (52, 54) have

been crimped thereabout,

characterized in that each ear is formed with a barb (56) having a
sharp edge (58) directed inwardly of the strain relief portion (8) and

an end edge extending from the sharp edge (58) and facing the wire
connecting portion (6), and

that each barb (56) is of triangular shape and tapers away from the
wire connecting portion (6), the end edge (59) extending at right

angles to the longitudinal axis (X-X) of the terminal (2).
A terminal as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that the ears (52,
54) are three in number, each ear extending from a respective

sidewall (48, 50) of the lead strain relief portion (8), two of the
ears (54) upstanding from one sidewall (50) in axially spaced relationship,
