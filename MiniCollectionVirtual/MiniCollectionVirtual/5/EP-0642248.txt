<ABSTRACT>
A small number of terminals, which can be connected as required to one another or to an exchange line, are connected to the communications system. The totality of all the units and individual elements forming the small communications system are integrated in a standard telephone terminal whose housing has not been additionally adapted, while the system functions, the subscriber-line and exchange-line related connection functions and also the control functions for the service features which can be implemented are maintained. In this telephone terminal, the functional units originally provided for its use as a telephone terminal and the associated operating-side input and display elements remain unchanged.
