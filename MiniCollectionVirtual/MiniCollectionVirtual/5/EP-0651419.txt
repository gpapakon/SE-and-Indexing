<ABSTRACT>
A method of manufacturing a dispenser cathode, in which method a 
powder of a refractory metal and a scandium-containing powder are mixed with each 

other and pressed to form a cathode body. According to the invention at least both these 
powders and a suitable binder are mixed with each other to form a homogeneous 

suspension prior to the pressing operation and the whole mixture is subsequently cured 
and ground to granules having a larger average size and hence a greater fluidity than the 

grains of the starting powders. Subsequently the granules thus obtained are pressed to 
form a cathode body (2). 
The invention leads to a better processibility and greater convenience of 
handling of the starting powders so that notably very fine starting powders can be used, 

which results in cathodes (1) having a better recovery after ion bombardment as 
compared with cathodes manufactured in conventional manners which are necessarily 

based on relatively coarse powders.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of manufacturing a dispenser cathode,
according to the introductory paragraph of Claim 1.In this context, the term "rare earth metal" is not limited to the
lanthanides, but also includes yttrium and scandium.Such a method is known from European Patent Application no. 298558
laid open to public inspection. In the method described in said document, a refractory
metal in the form of tungsten powder and a scandium-containing powder comprising
pure scandium or scandium hydride are mixed with each other in a ratio of 95:5 percent
by weight, whereafter the powder mixture is compressed and sintered to form a cathode
body which consists of mainly porous tungsten in which the scandium has been
distributed. The cathode body is further provided with a barium-containing component
by impregnating the cathode body at an elevated temperature with molten barium
calcium aluminate to incorporate an electron emissive material.Such a cathode is generally referred to as mixed-matrix scandate cathode
and comprises a porous matrix mainly consisting of the refractory metal in which
oxidized scandium (scandate) is distributed, while the barium-containing component,
which usually has an oxidized form, is present in the pores of the matrix.The oxidized states of scandium and of barium will hereinafter be referred
to as scandium oxide and barium oxide, respectively, without exclusively indicating
purely stoichiometric compounds, unless explicitly stated. The oxidized states may
comprise, for example hybrid forms of stoichiometric oxides, viz. mixed oxides.The barium-containing component ensures that a mono-atomic layer
comprising barium is formed on the emissive surface of the cathode. The barium oxide
is then reduced to barium by the matrix metal. Due to the mono-atomic top layer, the 
work function of free electrons in the matrix is sufficiently decreased to render electron
emission possible. Since the mono-atomic top layer continuously loses barium due to the
inevitable evaporation of barium, barium is, however, to be dispensed continuously so
as to maintain the layer, which accounts for the name of such a cathode. Barium is
dispensed in that, during operation, barium oxide which is reduced or not reduced
diffuses from the pores to the emissive surface where it replenishes the mono-atomic
layer.In a mixed matrix scandate cathode the electron work function is further
reduced in that not only barium but also scandium is present in the mono-atomic top
layer. Such a cathode thus has an extremely
