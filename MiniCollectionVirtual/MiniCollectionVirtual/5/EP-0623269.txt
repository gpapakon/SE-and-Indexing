<ABSTRACT>
A rate converter for digitally converting the sample rate of a signal, has a first digital filter for deriving an intermediate signal at increased sample rate and a second digital filter for deriving an output signal at a decreased sample rate relative to that of the intermediate signal. The first filter is of relatively high order serving to double the frequency. Because the frequency change is a power of two, the aperture characteristic is straightforward and implementation is simple even at high order. The second filter is of relatively low order so that implementation is simple even with a time-varying aperture characteristic. The low order of the second filter does not however degrade the overall frequency characteristic.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the sampling of video or other signals.When converting video signals to digital form, there are conflicting
criteria in selecting the sampling frequency. For historical reasons and
because of certain regulatory standards, much existing hardware operates at
arbitrary fixed frequencies. A commonly used frequency is 13.50MHz. For other
reasons, it is often preferred to use a sampling rate which is an integral
multiple of the colour sub-carrier frequency. There are particular advantages
in sampling at four times the sub-carrier frequency, these advantages
including a simple demodulation procedure and a convenient phase relationship
between pixels in neighbouring lines. On this theoretical basis, a sampling
frequency of 17.73MHz might for example, be selected for PAL.A technique already exists for converting a digital video signal
sampled at, say, 17.73MHz to a digital signal at 13.50MHz. Generally, the
signal is converted to analogue, using of course the original sampling
frequency; low pass filtered and - usually - amplified. The analogue signal
is then reconverted to digital at the desired sampling frequency. The
frequency response of the low pass filter is required to be of high quality
and is generally specified in the regulatory standards such as CCIR 601.Whilst analogue filtering techniques are available to meet the
frequency response standards, it is inconvenient, and often, extremely so, to
add digital-to-analogue and analogue-to-digital conversions in an otherwise
digital environment, for the purpose only of rate conversion. Also, the
analogue stage is of course a possible source of error. There is,
accordingly, considerable advantage to be gained if rate conversion could be
achieved digitally. There have hitherto been considerable difficulties in the use of
digital filters in this application. This can be explained as follows.The order or quality of frequency response of a digital filter can be
related to the number of samples employed. It will be recognised that very
close parallels exist in this context between digital filtering and the
interpolation between digital signal values. In deriving an estimated value,
away from a sample point, by interpolating from neighbouring sample points,
accuracy is of course increased as the number of samples included within the
interpolation, is increased. By the same token, the frequency response of a
digital filter will improve as the number of samples (or in filter
terminology, the number of taps) is increased. It can be estimated,
