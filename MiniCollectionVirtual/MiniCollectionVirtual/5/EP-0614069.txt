<ABSTRACT>
In a laser gyroscope, a non-reciprocal phase modulation 
is introduced between the clockwise (CW) and 

counterclockwise (CCW) beams at a modulation frequency (f). 
The CW and CCW beams are combined on a detector and the 

intensity of the output is observed at the fundamental 
frequency (f) and the higher harmonics (e.g. 2f, 4f). At 

each frequency, the detected signal is demodulated by mixing 
it with a reference signal at the same frequency and 

stepping the phase of the signal through successive 
increments of 90°, thereby to determine the in-phase and 

quadrature components for each frequency monitored.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to laser gyroscopes and in
particular but not exclusively, to open loop fibre optic
gyroscopes.In a fibre optic gyroscope a clockwise (CW) beam and a
counterclockwise (CCW) beam pass around a coil of optical
fibre and are brought together on leaving the coil to
interfere on a detector. When rotation is applied to the
gyroscope a rate-related non-reciprocal phase shift is
introduced between the CW and CCW beams which varies the
intensity on the detector. In some closed loop designs of
such gyroscopes, a further compensatory, non-reciprocal
phase shift is applied to "null" the rotation-induced phase
shift and the applied rate is then determined on the basis
of the amount of the compensatory phase shift required. In
these designs, the intensity of the signal on the detector
is used in the gyroscope control loop but is not used as an
absolute measure of the applied rate. However the processing
of such closed loop gyroscopes means that they are
complex, requiring precision modulators and are thus
expensive to produce.In an open loop gyroscope, the applied rate is determined
on the basis of the variation in intensity of the
combined CW and CCW signals and so accuracy in measurement
of the intensity is very important if the gyroscope is to
provide accurate readings over a large dynamic range.Thus, a need exists for an open loop fibre optic
gyroscope which implements a processing technique which 
allows accurate determination of the variations in intensity due to applied rate,
preferably reducing some of the errors associated with relatively low cost phase
modulators and offset errors generally.Accordingly, in one aspect, this invention provides a laser gyroscope,
comprising:
means defining a ring or coil around a sensing axis and around which light
may propagate in clockwise (CW) and counterclockwise (CCW) directions;beam input means for introducing into said ring or coil a CW beam and a
CCW beam to propagate in opposite directions around said ring or coil;phase modulation means for generating a phase modulation signal for
applying a phase modulation between said CW and CCW beams at a modulation
frequency;means for combining said CW)and CCW beams after passage around said
ring or coil;detector means for detecting said combined CW and CCW beams, andprocessor means for monitoring the intensity of the output of said detector
means at a plurality of integral multiples of said modulation frequency or at
said modulation frequency itself, thereby to determine the rate applied to said
gyroscope,
