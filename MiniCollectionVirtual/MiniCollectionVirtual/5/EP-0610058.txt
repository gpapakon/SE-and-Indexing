<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a device for suppressing
voltage fluctuation and higher harmonics. And more
particularly, in a system wherein power is supplied from a
power source system to a load of large power fluctuation and
harmonic current, this invention relates to a device for
suppressing voltage fluctuation and higher harmonics, that
suppresses the voltage fluctuation and higher harmonics of
the power source system that are created by the power
fluctuation of the load.In order to suppress the voltage fluctuations and
higher harmonics of a power source system EP-A2-0 476 618
discloses higher harmonic power components (Ph,Oh) and
fundamental wave reactive power components (QO) are derived
from a load voltage (Vs) and current (iL), using theory
(instantaneous p-q theory) regarding instantaneous real
power and instantaneous imaginary power. Gains are then
obtained which make the higher harmonic power components
(Ph , Qh) and fundamental wave reactive power components (Qo)
not exceed predetermined limit values. The higher harmonic
power components (Ph,Qh) and fundamental wave reactive
power components (Qo) are respectively multiplied by the
gains to obtain limited higher harmonic power components
(Ph' , Qh') and fundamental wave reactive power components
(Qo'). An output current command is generated in accordance
with the limited higher harmonic power components (Ph' , Qh')
and fundamental wave reactive power components (Qo'). The
output current command is supplied to an inverter which in
turn supplies a compensation current (ic) to the power 
system.A device in parallel with the load for compensating
the reactive power, negative phase sequence current and
harmonic current of the load is described in the
specification of Japanese patent disclosure No. H3-183324
and U.S.P No. 5,077,517.Fig. 4 of the accompanying drawings shows a
diagrammatic circuit layout of such a conventional device
for suppressing voltage fluctuation and higher harmonics.
To avoid complexity, the three-phase system is shown as a
single-line connection diagram.In Fig. 4, power is supplied to a load 1 from an AC
power source 2 through a transmission line 3 (let its
impedance be jXS) and a receiving transformer 4 (let its
impedance be jXT). A voltage fluctuation and higher
harmonics suppression device constituted by a self-commutated
converter 10 is arranged in parallel with load 1
and is controlled by a control circuit 30. A harmonic
filter 7 is provided with the object of suppressing the
higher harmonics generated by load 1 and improving
