<ABSTRACT>
The first transfer passage (8) emerges in the precombustion chamber (5) in a region which is substantially centred on the wall (10) of the precombustion chamber, and points towards the cylinder (3). The second transfer passage (16), whose cross-section is less than that of the first transfer passage (8), points towards the inside of the precombustion chamber (5) so that its axis (15) meets the axis (13) of the injector (6) along which the jet (18) is formed, inside the precombustion chamber (5) and emerges into the precombustion chamber (5) in an off-centred region.

A compression-ignition engine comprising at least one cylinder (3) and a precombustion 
chamber (5) connected to the cylinder (3) by way of a first transfer passage (8) and a 

second transfer passage (16) which are substantially rectilinear, and comprising a fuel 
injector (6) for forming a jet of fuel (18) directed towards the interior of the 

precombustion chamber (5), wherein the second transfer passage (16) with a cross-section 
smaller than the cross-section of the first transfer passage (8) is directed towards 

the interior of the precombustion chamber (5) in such a manner that its axis (15) meets 
the axis (13) of the injector (6) along which the jet (18) is formed, inside the 

precombustion chamber (5) and opens into the precombustion chamber (5) in an 
eccentric area, characterised in that the first transfer passage (8) opens into the 

precombustion chamber (5) in a substantially central area on the wall (10) of the 
precombustion chamber (5) facing the cylinder (3). 
An ignition engine according to Claim 1, characterised in that the axis (15) of the 
auxiliary passage (16) has an angle of inclination α of between 50 and 70°, in relation to 

the joint face (2a) of a cylinder head (2) in which the precombustion chamber (5) is 
arranged, which joint face bounds a main chamber of the cylinder (3) and along which 

the transfer passages (8, 16) open into the cylinder (3). 
An engine according to Claim 2, characterised in that the angle of inclination α of the 
axis (15) of the auxiliary passage (16) has a value of approximately 60°. 
An engine according to any one of the preceding claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the 
axis (12) of the main transfer passage (8) has an angle of inclination , in relation to the 

joint face (2a) of the cylinder head (2), of between 40 and 60°. 
An engine according to Claim 4, characterised in that the angle  of inclination of the 
axis 12 of the main transfer passage (8) in relation to the joint face (2a) has a value of 

approximately 50 °. 
An engine according to any one of Claims 1 to 5, comprising in addition one spark plug 
(7) having a heating member (14) projecting inside the precombustion chamber (5), 

characterised in that the axis (15) of the auxiliary transfer passage (16) meets the  
 

axis (13) of the injector (6) along which a jet of fuel (18) is directed at a point (17) 
adjacent the end of the heating member (14) of the preheating electrode (7). 
An engine according to any one of Claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the main transfer 
passage (8) and the auxiliary transfer passage (16) are machined from one member (9) 

mounted in a cylinder head (2), inside which the precombustion chamber (5) is arranged, 
and defining a section of the wall of the precombustion chamber (5). 
An engine according to any one of Claims 1 to 7, characterised in that the main transfer 
passage (8) and the auxiliary transfer passage (16) diverge in the direction going from the 

main chamber of the cylinder (3) to the precombustion chamber (5).
