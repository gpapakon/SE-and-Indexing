Safety device against overpressure failure of
a nuclear reactor pressure vessel (1) in the event of

insufficient core cooling, wherein a pressure pipe (23,
230) projecting into the interior (24) of the pressure

vessel (1) and guided through its wall in a pressure-tight
manner has at least one pressure compensation

opening (26, 51) arranged in the pressure-vessel
interior (24) and sealed by a fusible sealing body (25,

50), wherein the fusible sealing body (25, 50) melts
open at a limiting temperature and releases the

pressure compensation opening (26, 51), but keeps the
pressure compensation opening (26, 51) closed during

normal operation, and wherein the fusible sealing body
(25, 50) consists of a melting solder which contains

silver and is therefore radiation-resistant.
Safety device according to claim 1,
characterized in that the pressure pipe (23, 230) is a

blow-off pipe and the pressure compensation opening
(26) is a pressure relief opening.
Safety device according to claim 1,
characterized in that the pressure pipe (230) is a

pressure control pipe with which a blow-off valve (44)
provided outside the vessel for reducing the system

pressure can be controlled.
Safety device according to one of claims 1 to
3, characterized in that the pressure pipe (23) in

suspended arrangement is guided in a sealing manner
through a cover connection piece (34) of the pressure

vessel (1) and, with a perforated pipe head (27) sealed
by the fusible sealing body (25), projects into the

interior (24) of the pressure vessel (1).
Safety device according to one of claims 1 to
3, characterized in that the pressure pipe (23) with a

perforated pipe head (27) sealed by means of the
fusible sealing body (25) is positioned below the 

reactor core (2), in particular within a lower core
structure (7), and in that the pressure pipe (23) in

the interior (6) of the bottom hemisphere (11) is
displaced downwards and, subsequently in the annular

space (5) between the core vessel (16) and the
pressure-vessel wall (22), upwards to a pressure-tight

penetration which is placed in the wall region between
the main coolant connection pieces (4, 9).
Safety device according to one of claims 4 or
5, characterized in that the perforated pipe head (27)

is sealed on the front side by a pipe plug (28), in
that the perforated pipe head (27) has several pressure

compensation openings (26) adjacent to each other in
its pipe shell wall (29), and in that the pressure

compensation openings (26) are sealed by a fusible
sleeve (25) soldered on to the pipe shell wall (29).
Relief device according to claim 6,
characterized by several rings (32) of pressure

compensation openings (26) which are adjacent to each
other in a pipe-axial manner.
Safety device according to claim 6 or 7,
characterized in that the pipe plug (28) has a conical

profile with a rounded tip.
Safety device according to one of claims 1 or
2 and 4 to 8, characterized in that the pressure pipe

(23) outside the pressure vessel (1) opens as blow-off
line (43) into a blow-off vessel.
Safety device according to one of claims 1
and 3 to 8, characterized in that the pressure pipe

constructed as pressure control pipe (230) is sealed at
its end which projects into the interior (24) of the

pressure vessel (1) in particular by a cover (52) and
has in its shell wall at least one pressure

compensation bore (51), within which a spherical metal
body (53) is embedded into a fusible sealing body (50).
Safety device according to claim 10, 
characterized in that the pressure compensation bore

(851) is an inclined bore, the bore axis (51') of which
is oriented in an inclined manner to the inside, so

that in the event of fusion the spherical body (53)
falls into the interior of the pressure control pipe

(230).
Safety device according to one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the limiting

temperature lies in the range of 600°C to 700°C.
Safety device according to one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the melting

solder has a high silver content which lies in
particular at 50%.
