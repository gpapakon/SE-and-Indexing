<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for cleaning waste water or waste slurry by means of ion exchangers held on carriers, comprising: a container; feed means for feeding the waste water for cleaning to the container; carrier feed means for feeding carriers provided with ion exchangers to the container; an agitation device arranged in the container; and a separating device connected to the container by means of a pipe for separating the carriers from the waste water. As a result of these steps the carriers of the ion exchangers are carried suspended or floating into the water, so that the danger of blockage is avoided. The separating device prevents the ion exchangers being discharged together with the waste water that has meanwhile been cleaned. This separating device can be formed by a filter, for example, a mechanical or an electrostatic filter, but can likewise be formed by a magnetic separating device. The carriers must then of course be magnetic.

<DESCRIPTION>
APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR CLEANING WASTE WATER AND WASTE SLUDGE BY MEANS OF ION EXCHANGERSThe present invention relates to a device for cleaning waste water by means of ion exchangers held on carriers. Such devices are generally known.With such known devices the ion exchangers are held on carriers, which carriers are placed together into a con¬ tainer, and wherein the waste water for cleaning is guided through the container. The waste water for cleaning herein flows into the pores which are formed by the spaces between the carriers, so that the waste water for cleaning comes into intensive contact with the walls of the carriers.Although such carriers operate well in removing the was¬ te products from the water, such devices operate badly with turbid waste water; due to solid substances present in suspension or otherwise floating or formed in the waste water, this device becomes blocked so that it becomes in¬ operative.The object of the present invention is to provide a de¬ vice which also operates well in the case of turbid waste water and remains operative.This object is achieved in that the device comprises: a container; feed means for feeding the waste water for cle¬ aning to the container; carrier feed means for feeding carriers provided with ion exchangers to the container; an agitation device arranged in the container; and a separa¬ ting device connected to the container by means of a pipe for separating the carriers from the waste water.As a result of these steps the carriers of the ion ex¬ changers are placed suspended or floating in the water, so that the danger of blockage is avoided. The separating device prevents the ion exchangers from being discharged together with the waste water that has meanwhile been cle¬ aned.This separating device can be formed by a filter, for example a mechanical or an electro-static filter, but isSUBSTI 

preferably formed by a magnetic separating device. The carriers must then of course be magnetic.According to a preferred embodiment the device for cleaning waste water is formed by at least two devices connected in series as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the carrier feed means are adapted for feeding the carriers provided with ion exchangers to the second con¬ tainer in the flow direction, wherein the second sepa¬ rating device in downstream direction is adapted for feeding the separated carriers provided with partially used up ion exchangers to the first container in the flow direction, and wherein the first separating means in the flow direction is adapted
