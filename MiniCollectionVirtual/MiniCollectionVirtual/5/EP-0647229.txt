<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to new diamine salts of 
clavulanic acid, pharmaceutical compositions thereof, and to the 
use of these salts in the production of clavulanic acid and salts 
and esters thereof. GB patent 1508977 discloses that clavulanic acid, which has 
the formula (I): 
 
and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters are antibacterial 
agents, able to enhance the effectiveness of penicillins 
and cephalosporins against many Î²-lactamase-producing bacteria. US patent 4,650,795 discloses a group of primary amine salts 
of clavulanic acid which give stable pharmaceutical compositions. EP patent 26044 discloses the use of the t-butylamine salt 
as a useful intermediate in the preparation of clavulanic acid. The non-prepublished EP patent application 562583 discloses 
the same use for N,N-diisopropylethylenediammonium di clavulanate 
and N,N-diethylethylenediammonium di clavulanate, both of the 
secondary, secondary type. Surprisingly it has been found that tertiary, tertiary diamine 
salts of clavulanic acid have improved properties compared 
to the t-butyl amine salt of clavulanic acid mentioned above. 
For instance, large crystals of the mono salt of N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-1,2-diaminoethane 
clavulanate can easily be precipitated 
in pure form. The salt is therefore a very useful intermediate 
in the preparation of clavulanic acid. Accordingly, the present invention provides tertiary, 
tertiary diamine mono salts of the formula (IIa):  
 
 
where R1 and R2 are each a (1-8C)alkyl, (3-8C)cycloalkyl or 
(3-8C)cycloalkyl(1-8C)alkyl group, optionally having one or more 
inert substituents selected from the group consisting of halogen, 
hydroxy, C1 to C4 alkyl, C1 to C4 alkoxyl, C1 to C4 acyloxyl and 
C1 to C4 esterified carboxyl, or are interlinked to form a ring 
of 4-7 ring atoms; R3 and R4 are each a (1-8C) alkyl, (3-8C)cycloalkyl 
or (3-8C)cycloalkyl(1-8C)alkyl group, optionally having 
one or more inert substituents selected from the group consisting 
of halogen, hydroxy, C1 to C4 alkyl, C1 to C4 alkoxyl, C1 to C4 
acyloxyl and C1 to C4 esterified carboxyl, or are interlinked 
to form a ring of 4-7 ring atoms; X is hydrogen, hydroxy or 
halogen; and m and n are each 0-5, respectively. An alkyl group may be branched or straight chain. A C1 to C8 alkyl group is preferably a C1 to C4 alkyl group, 
for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, sec.butyl 
or tert.butyl, more preferably it is methyl. A C3 to C8 cycloalkyl group is preferably a C5 to C7 cycloalkyl 
group, for example
