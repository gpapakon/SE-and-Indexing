<ABSTRACT>
A container (10) of a heat set plastic material adapted for hot fill applications includes a plurality of elongated vertically oriented vacuum panels (24) in its sidewall (12) and first and second circumferentially extending inwardly directed reinforcement ribs (31, 32) which are located in the label mounting areas (29, 30) above and below the vacuum panels and which cooperate with upper and lower label bumpers (21, 22) of the container to support the upper and lower edges (25, 26) of the vacuum panels, permitting the center portions of the panels to flex inward during filling and sealing the container with a hot liquid, but resisting deformation of the container sidewall in compensating for the hot-fill vacuum.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to hot-fill plastic or polyester containers, and more
particularly to such a container having an improved sidewall construction.In the past, most plastic or polyester containers were used to contain
liquids that are initially dispensed at room temperature or chilled. However, in
recent years, there has been a significant increase in the demand for polyester
containers for packaging "hot fill" beverages. "Hot-fill" applications impose
additional mechanical stresses on the container structure which cause the
container to be less resistant to deformation when the container is being handled
or if it is dropped. The thin sidewalls of conventional polyester containers
deform or collapse at hot fill temperatures. Moreover, the rigidity of the
container decreases immediately after the "hot-fill" liquid is introduced into the
container, making the container more susceptible to failure due to mechanical
stresses. As the hot-filled liquid cools, it shrinks in volume which has the effect
of producing a negative pressure or "hot-fill" vacuum in the container. 1 he
container must be able to sustain such internal pressure changes while
maintaining its configuration.Various methods have been devised to counter thermal instabilities. One
method broadly involves heat treating the polyester to induce molecular changes
which will result in a container exhibiting thermal stability. Other methods
involve forming the polyester structure into a structural configuration which can
maintain stability during hot fill. Thus, the hot-fill containers being produced
have a generally cylindrical main body which is provided with a plurality of
elongated vertically oriented panels. These panels, which are commonly
referred to as pressure or vacuum panels, are designed to collapse inwardly
after the container has been filled with a hot liquid so as to accommodate the
inevitable volume shrinkage of the liquid in the container as the liquid cools.
However, the inward flexing of the panels caused by the hot fill vacuum creates
high stress points at the top and bottom edges of the pressure panels, and
especially at the upper and lower corners of the panels. These stress points
weaken the portions of the sidewall near the edges of the panels, allowing the 
sidewall to collapse inwardly during handling of the container or when containers
are stacked together.This problem could be alleviated by increasing the thickness of the
container wall. However, increasing the wall thickness results in an increase in
material cost for

A thin-wall container (10) formed from a heat set plastic material and adapted to be
filled with a liquid at a temperature elevated above room temperature and then sealed, said container

having an upper portion (14) which includes a sealable closure (15) an upper walled portion and an upper label bumper (21), a
lower portion including a base (16) closing the bottom of the container and a laser label bumper (22), and a sidewall portion (12)

which is generally tubular in shape and being formed integrally with and extending from said
upper label bumper (21) to said lower label bumper (22), said sidewall portion (12) including a plurality of

elongated vertically oriented vacuum panels (24) which are adapted to flex inwardly due to filling
and sealing of the container with a liquid at an elevated temperature and subsequent cooling of the

liquid, each of said vacuum panels (24) having an upper edge (25), a lower edge (20), and a panel
portion intermediate said upper and lower edges, said upper edges of said vacuum panels being

spaced apart from said upper portion and thereby defining an upper label mounting area (29)
above said vacuum panels (24), and said lower edges of said vacuum panels being spaced apart from

said lower portion and thereby denning a lower label mounting area (30) below said vacuum panels

characterized by
 at least one annular reinforcement rib (31, 32) within one
of said label mounting areas (29, 30), said reinforcement rib extending around the circumference of

said sidewall portion (12), said reinforcement rib supporting said vacuum panels (24) along at least
one of their edges
 (25, 26) to hold said supported edges fixed while permitting said panel portions
intermediate said edges (25, 26) to flex inwardly during filling and sealing of the container and

resisting deformation of said vacuum panels (24) subsequent to inward flexing of said vacuum
panels (24) after filling and sealing of said container. 
The container according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 said reinforcement rib is
spaced apart from the edges of said panels (25, 26) and is located closer to said panel edges than to

said upper portion or said lower portion.
The container according to claim 1,

 said reinforcement ribs (31,
32) are immediately adjacent to the edges (25, 26) of said panels (24) which are located adjacent to

said one label mounting area (29, 30).

characterized in that
 said reinforcement ribs
includes first and second reinforcement ribs (31, 32), said first reinforcement rib (31) located in said

upper label mounting area (29) and said second reinforcement rib (32) located in said lower label
mounting area (30).
The container according to claim 4, 
characterized in that
 said first and second
reinforcement ribs (31, 32) are located in said upper (29) and lower label mounting (30) areas,

respectively, spaced apart from the edges (25, 26) of said panel (24) and said first reinforcement rib
(31) is located closer to said panel upper edges (25) than to said upper portion (14) and said

second reinforcement rib (32) is located closer to said panel lower edges (26) than to said lower
portion of said container (16).
The container according to claim 4, 
characterized in that
 said first and second
reinforcement ribs (31, 32) are immediately adjacent to the upper and lower edges (25, 26)

respectively, of said panels (24). 
The container according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 said reinforcement rib (31,
32) is generally semi-cylindrical in cross section.
