<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to retroreflective articles designed for 
applications in which the articles themselves are curved, or are applied to a curved 
substrate. More particularly, the retroreflective articles comprise reflective cubes 
located proximate the neutral axis of the articles. Many types of retroreflective elements utilize either glass beads or 
cube corners as the retroreflective optical element. Generally, when these 
retroreflective elements are assembled into articles or sheeting, the resulting product 
is nearly flat (in the case of inflexible articles such as automobile taillights) or 
designed to be applied to a flat substrate (such as a flexible sheeting applied to a 
metallic substrate, e.g., a traffic sign). Many applications, however, require curved retroreflective elements 
fabricated from retroreflective sheeting. For example, retroreflective posts, cones, 
and barrels require that the sheeting bend to conform to a curved substrate. Another 
example is truck trailers with corrugations or rivets on the sides. Retroreflective 
sheeting must undergo substantial bending to conform to such surfaces. 
Retroreflective sheeting for such applications often utilize glass beads as the optical 
element. These beads are generally much higher in modulus than the polymers used 
in the carrier film (100 times or more). Therefore, very little deformation of the 
beads occurs during bending, and optical performance is not degraded. Retroreflective sheeting using cube corners as the optical elements is 
also utilized in curved applications because of higher retroreflective efficiency. If such 
sheeting is made sufficiently thin, it will conform during applications requiring 
significant bending, as shown in Rowland U. S. Patent nos. 3684348, 3935359; 
Martin U. S. Patent no. 4801193; and Pricone U. S. Patent no. 4672089. However, 
the cubes in curved sheeting constructions are generally at or near the surface of the 
sheeting and tend to undergo significant optically degrading deformation. This occurs  
 
because the cubes are made from materials similar in modulus to the rest of the 
sheeting. Other literature, such as Lemelson U. S. Patent no. 4127693, 
describes cube corner constructions where the cubes are formed at the interface 
between two polymeric materials. However, during bending such cubes may still 
undergo significant deformation even though they are not located at the outer surface 
of the sheeting. Such deformation distorts the cubes and degrades optical 
performance. The invention

A layered retroreflective cube corner element 
article (10) for bending applications, said article comprising: 


a) an article outer surface (35) such that during 
article bending the outer surface undergoes tension and an 

article inner surface (34) such that during article bending the 
inner surface undergoes compression; 
b) a neutral bending axis region (38) located relative 
to the outer surface and the inner surface so that the 

neutral bending axis region comprises a neutral bending axis 
which is substantially free of stress and deformation during 

article bending; and 
c) a plurality of retroreflective cube corner 
elements (14) positioned between the outer surface and the inner 

surface; 
 
   characterized in that the cube corner elements 

each having surfaces purposefully located proximate the 
neutral bending axis to reduce strain energy density on the 

retroreflective cubes and to enhance the optical performance 
of the article. 
A method of manufacturing a retroreflective cube 
corner element laminated sheet for bending applications, 

comprising the steps of: 

a) providing a sheet with an outer surface 
designed for tension during laminated sheet bending and a 

sheet inner surface designed for compression during 
laminated sheet bending; and, 
b) positioning a plurality of retroreflective 
cubes within the sheet, each cube having a cube base and a 

cube peak; the plurality of cubes being positioned 
intentionally proximate to the neutral bending axis of the 

sheet to create cptimal retroreflective performance for a 
given radius of curvature.
