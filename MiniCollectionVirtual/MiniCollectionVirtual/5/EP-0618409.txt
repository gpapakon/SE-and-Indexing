<ABSTRACT>
Underfloor heating system for floors, having an insulating layer made of expanded polystyrene insulating boards, heating pipes made of plastic which are laid on the insulating layer, and U-holders made of plastic for the heating pipes. The underfloor heating system is laid upon the floor, the U-holders engaging over the heating pipes with their web and being pushed into the insulating layer with their legs and also anchored in the insulating layer by barb elements. A floating floor screed is applied to the insulating layer with the laid heating pipes. The expanded polystyrene insulating layer consists of a bottom layer with a low specific gravity and a top layer with a high specific gravity. Both layers belong jointly to a monolithic insulating-board unit. The legs of the U-holders possess barb elements which are arranged in the shape of a V in the pushing-in direction, are elastically deformable towards the assigned leg and can be spread apart under the influence of tensile forces acting on the U-holders. In the pushed-in state, the barb elements are situated in the bottom layer of the insulating-board units. The top layer of the insulating-board units is tread-resistant due to its layer thickness. Due to their board thickness, the insulating-board units comply as a whole with the requirements according to DIN 4109.

A floor heating system for intermediate floors (1) 
in flats, particularly in residential accommodation, 

comprising: 

an insulating substrate (2, 3) made of Styrolpor 
insulating boards, 
plastic heating pipes (4) laid on the insulating 
substrate (2, 3) and 
plastic U-shaped holders (5) for the heating pipes 
(4), 
 
wherein the floor heating system is laid on the 

intermediate floor (1), and the web (6) of the holders 
(5) extends over the heating pipes (4) and the arms (7) 

thereof are pushed into the insulating substrate (2, 3) 
and anchored therein by barbed elements (8, 9), a 

floating screed (10) being applied to the insulating 
substrate (2, 3) in which the pipes (4) are laid, and 

wherein the following features are embodied in 
combination: 


a) the Styrolpor insulating substrate consists 
of a lower layer (2) having a specific 

gravity of 10 to 15 kg/m
3
 and an upper layer 
(3) having a specific gravity greater by a 

factor of 1.5 to 3 than the specific gravity 
of the lower layer (2), 
b) the two layers (2 and 3) belong to 
homogeneous insulating-board units, and  

 
c) the arms (7) of the U-holders (5) in the 
direction of pushing in have V-shaped barbed 

elements (8, 9) which are elastically 
deformable relative to the associated arm and 

are spreadable by the tensile forces acting 
on the U-holders (5) and the barbed elements 

(8, 9) when pushed in are in the lower layer 
(2) of the homogeneous damping-board units, 

and 
 
wherein the upper layer (3) of the homogeneous damping-board 

units is given a thickness of 10 to 20 mm so as 
to be non-crushable and the insulating-board unit is 

made up of boards having a total thickness which meets 
the requirements of DIN 4109. 
A floor heating system according to claim 1, 
wherein the upper layer (3) of the homogeneous 

insulating-board unit has a specific gravity greater by 
a factor of approximately 2 than the specific gravity 

of the lower layer. 
A floor heating system according to claim 1 or 2, 
wherein the homogeneous damping-board units comprise a 

lower layer (2) having a specific gravity of about 
12 kg/m
3
 and an upper layer (3) having a specific 
gravity of 25 to 35 kg/m
3
, preferably about 30 kg/m
3

on the one hand on the tips of the arms (7) and on the 
other hand in the central region of the arms (7) so 

that, when considered in the pushed-in state, they are 
disposed in the upper region of the lower layer (2) of 

the damping-board units and grip underneath the upper 
layer (3). 
A floor heating system according to claim 6, 
wherein at least the barbed elements (8, 9) in the 

upper region of the lower layer (2) are doubled. 
A floor heating system according to any of claims 
1 to 7, wherein the heating-board units have a minimum 

tensile strength of 0.02 N/mm
