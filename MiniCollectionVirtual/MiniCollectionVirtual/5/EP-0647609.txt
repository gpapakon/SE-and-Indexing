<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing a high-purity fluorinated vinyl ether efficiently, which comprises reacting a fluorinated carboxylic 
acid halide with a metallic compound in the absence of any solvent at a temperature below the decomposition temperature of the 

corresponding metallic salt to be formed and heating the formed salt above the decomposition temperature thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present inventions relate to production methods of 
fluorinated vinyl ether, which is industrially useful for 
fluorine-containing synthetic resin or rubber etc. Fluorinated vinyl ether is known as a raw material that 
is copolymerized with tetrafluoroethylene (TFE) or other 
copolymerizable monomers into industrially useful resin and 
rubber (e.g. PFA resin, which is a copolymer with TFE, 
perfluoro rubber, denatured PTFE, and synthetic rubbers 
which are copolymers with other monomers). It is known that 
fluorinated vinyl ether is obtained by the method contained 
in JP-A-63132851 and EP-A-260773. For example, it is known that fluorinated vinyl ether 
is obtained through the thermal decomposition of Na salt, 
which is produced by reacting NaOH and fluorinated ether 
carboxylic acid fluoride as a raw material. The fluorinated 
ether carboxylic acid fluoride is produced by polymerizing 
HFPO (hexafluoropropylene oxide) by means of a catalyst such 
as CsF in a solvent such as tetraglyme. There have been various conditions for HFPO polymerization 
considered. There have also been various 
processes considered for obtaining vinyl ether from the  
 
resulted fluorinated ether carboxylic acid fluoride. For example, U.S.-A-3132123 
claims that the objective fluorinated vinyl ether 
is effectively obtained by flowing fluorinated carboxylic 
acid fluoride (normally in the gaseous state with inert gas 
as a carrier, such as N2) through a tower filled with a 
metal oxide or a metal salt and heated at about 300°C. In 
this reaction, however, temperature control is difficult. As 
a result, the reaction cannot effectively produce the 
objective substance of a high purity or at a high yield 
because this process tends to create unfavorable impurities. 
The reason for this impurity is thought to be that a local 
temperature rise at the reaction location causes unfavorable 
decomposition and the produced carbides cover the surface of 
the metal compounds, which lowers the reaction rate. This 
method must, therefore, involve the washing process 
including rinsing after the reaction and before the 
rectification. It also encompasses the difficult works of 
filling metallic compounds into the reaction tube and 
removing reaction residuals. JP-A-63132851 claims that the objective fluorinated vinyl ether 
is obtained at a relatively low temperature (the room 
temperature to 100°C) by reacting with an alkali such as 
sodium carbonate in a solvent such as tetraglyme. This  
 
process, however, produces a large amount of
