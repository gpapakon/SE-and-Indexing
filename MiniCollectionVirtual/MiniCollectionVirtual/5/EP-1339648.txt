<DESCRIPTION>
 Optical Elements Comprising a Polyfluoropolyether Surface TreatmentField of the InventionThe present invention relates to optical elements comprising fluorochemical surface treatments. The invention further relates to materials such as retroreflective sheetings, pavement markings and beaded projection screens comprising a binder and the surface treated optical elements. The fluorochemical surface treatment is substantially free of perfluoroalkyl groups having more than four carbon atoms. Preferably, the surface treatment is a polyfluoropolyether-based compound comprising at least one polar group or polar group-containing organic radical.Background of the InventionBeaded projection display screens, retroreflective sheeting used in the manufacture of roadway signs, and retroreflective paints typically include optical elements adhered through the use of a binder. In the case of beaded projection display materials, the optical elements are microscopic glass beads that act as lenses to collect projected light from the rear of the screen and focus it to relatively small spots, near the surfaces of the microspheres. The foci are approximately in the areas where the optical elements contact a front support layer. In other retroreflective materials, the optical elements act as lenses which focus the light onto a reflector (metal mirror of diffusely reflecting pigment) and once the light has been reflected off the reflector the microspheres again act as lenses to resend the light back toward the incoming light source. In order to contribute the desired retroreflective property, however, it is important that a layer of glass microspheres be present on the surface of the binder layer.As discussed in U.S. Patent No. 3,222,204, ordinary glass beads tend to sink into the uncured liquid binder layer. In instances wherein the individual beads are not entirely submerged, the optical properties of the bead can also be impaired by the binder wetting out the bead surface and spreading on the exposed bead surface. To address this problem, U.S. Patent No. 3,222,204 teaches coating the glass beads with a thin surface coating of an 

oleophobic fluorocarbon-sizing agent. At column 5, lines 61-75, this reference states that, "Aqueous treating solutions of fluorocarbon chromium coordination complexes are preferred and are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 2,662,835 (Dec. 15, 1953) and 2,809,990 (Oct. 15, 1957) and 2,934,450 (April 26, 1960). The complex maybe made by reacting chromyl chloride with a fluorocarbon monocarboxylic acid
