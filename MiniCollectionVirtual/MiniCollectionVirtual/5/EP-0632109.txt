<ABSTRACT>
A pearl lustre (nacreous, pearlescent) pigment comprising a plateletlike substrate coated with a layer of metal oxides and, atop the metal oxide layer, a top layer, said top layer consisting of silicon dioxide, at least one further metal hydroxide or metal oxide hydrate, and at least one organic coupling reagent. The further metal hydroxides or metal oxide hydrates are hydroxides or oxyhydrates of cerium, aluminium and zirconium or mixtures thereof. The coupling reagents used are organofunctional silanes, zirconium aluminates or esters of metal acids.

<CLAIMS>
Pearl lustre pigment based on a platelet-shaped
substrate coated with metal oxides and on a top layer

which is located on the metal oxide layer, characterized
in that the top layer possesses a multilayer structure

which consists of a first layer of silica, a second layer
of at least one hydroxide or oxide hydrate of the

elements cerium, aluminium or zirconium and a third,
outermost layer of at least one hydroxide or oxide

hydrate of the elements cerium, aluminium or zirconium
and an organic coupling reagent.
Pearl lustre pigment according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the coupling reagent is a zirconium

aluminate, a metal acid ester or an organofunctional
silane.
Process for preparing a pearl lustre pigment
according to Claim 1 based on a platelet-shaped substrate

coated with metal oxides and on a top layer which is
located on the metal oxide layer, characterized in that

the substrate coated with metal oxides is suspended in
water, silica is deposited in a first stage by adding a

water-soluble silicate in the pH range of 6-9,
subsequently in a second stage, following the addition of

one or more water-soluble metal salts in the pH range of
3 to 7 and heating at from 30 to 100째C, preferably from

40 to 75째C, some of the metal hydroxides and/or metal
oxide hydrates are deposited, in a third stage at least

one coupling reagent is added and is hydrolysed in a pH

range of 3-4, and finally, in a fourth stage at a pH of
4 to 8.5, the remainder of the metals, still in solution, 

are deposited as hydroxides and/or oxide hydrates
together with the coupling reagent, and the pigment is

then dried at from 80 to 160째C, preferably from 120 to
160째C.
Process according to Claim 3, characterized in
that the metal hydroxide or metal oxide hydrate is a

hydroxide or oxide hydrate, respectively, of aluminium,
cerium or zirconium.
Process according to one of Claims 3 and 4,
characterized in that the coupling reagent is a zirconium

aluminate, a metal acid ester or an organofunctional
silane.
Use of the pearl lustre pigment according to
Claims 1 to 5 for pigmenting paints, inks, plastics and

coatings.
Paints, inks, plastics and coatings pigmented
with a pearl lustre pigment according to Claims 1 to 5.
