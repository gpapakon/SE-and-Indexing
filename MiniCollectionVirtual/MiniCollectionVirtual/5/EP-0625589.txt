<ABSTRACT>
The reactor comprises a treatment chamber (15), in which a multiplicity of inlet orifices for a gaseous or vaporous reaction liquid are arranged. At least one outlet orifice (24) in relation to in each case one inlet orifice (23) is arranged in such a way that the flow leaving the inlet orifice enters the associated outlet orifice (24) after a flow inversion. As a result, arcuate flow paths distributed around the periphery of the workpiece (16) are formed, so that the surface of the workpiece is uniformly swept.
