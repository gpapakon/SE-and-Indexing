<ABSTRACT>
A cosmetic preparation dispenser (20) is provided 
that has a resilient tab (76) formed on the lower end of 

the innerbody (50) that presses against the cam sleeve 
(30) to provide a desirable swivel drag, and which tab 

(76) is prevented from undesirable deformation that reduces 
the swivel torque by providing a relaxation zone 

(80) in the cam sleeve (30) where the tab (76) can recall 
its original shape. The relaxation zone (80) is preferably 

a thin walled section (82) of the cam sleeve (30) that 
is formed by the combination of a flat outer wall (84) and 

a circular inner wall, which thin walled section (82) is 
deformable by pressure from the tab (76) when the tab (76) 

is seated against the thin walled section (82). The tab 
(76) presses against the cam sleeve (30) which causes the 

cam sleeve (30) to move up a bevelled shoulder (90) to 
enhance swivel drag between the cam slee
ve (30) and a 
retaining lip (70) on the innerbody (50). The bevelled 

shoulder (90) also engages the cam sleeve (30) when force 
is applied to the elevator.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of
cosmetic and lipstick dispensers, and particularly to a
dispenser suited to provide a consistent and long
lasting frictional swivel drag effect during operation
of the dispenser.Conventional propel/repel lipstick dispensers
typically have an outer helical cam track sleeve and a
longitudinal track innerbody rotatable inside the cam
sleeve to axially propel and retract an elevator cup
with a lug or lugs that track in the cam track and in
the longitudinal track.It is known in the art to provide cosmetic
dispensers such as lipstick cases with a desirable
frictional drag "feel" to the consumer operator when the
dispenser is operated to extend or retract the cosmetic
stick. It is desirable in providing such a feel that
the swivel torque needed to rotate the components to
dispense the lipstick remain nearly constant, regardless
of whether the dispenser is nearly full or exhausted of
the cosmetic. The swivel torque should be significant
enough to impart a firm feel to the dispenser.
Looseness, uneven drag, or inconsistency of torque can 
be interpreted by the consumer as indicating an inferior
quality product.The prior art has attempted to provide the desired
firmness and consistency of swivel torque by a number of
devices. United States Patent No. 4,750,501 to
Ackermann et al. is an example of one type of cosmetic
applicator wherein an objective is to impart an even
drag and swivel torque during operation. In other prior
art devices, two lugs or tabs are provided on the
elevator cup to press against the innerbody or the cam
sleeve to provide frictional interference therebetween;
in other devices ribs have been provided on the
innerbody that frictionally fit against the elevator
cup. However, these prior art devices have generally
suffered from inconsistent swivel torque along the
travel of the elevator cup as it moves from the extended
to the retracted position. This problem arises because
the effective inner diameter of the innerbody can vary
along its length and thereby vary the swivel torque in
an undesirable manner. The dispenser can therefore tend
to feel looser when the cup is at one end and tighter
when the cup is at the other end.In yet other prior art devices, two lugs or tabs
are provided on the innerbody to press against the cam
sleeve to provide frictional interference between the
two rotating elements of the dispenser. Such a device is
shown for example in U.S. Patent No. 5,186,560, issued
Feb. 16, 1993 to Holloway, the disclosure of which is
hereby

<CLAIMS>
A cosmetic dispenser (20) formed of a
plastic material, comprising: a cam sleeve (30) having

upper and lower ends and inner and outer walls and having
an internal helical track (40,42) extending along a

substantial length of the inner wall of said cam sleeve
(30), said cam sleeve having a tubular cam sleeve base

(34); an innerbody (50) having upper and lower ends, said
innerbody (50) being fitted into said tubular cam sleeve

(30) and being provided with a longitudinal track (60, 62)
extending through the wall of said innerbody (50) along

a substantial length of said innerbody, said innerbody
having a retaining lip (70) at its upper end to retain

said cam sleeve thereto; and a generally cylindrical
elevator cup (100) for containing a cosmetic preparation,

fitted into said innerbody (50) and having a cam follower
lug (104) extending through said longitudinal track

(60,62) to engage said helical track (40,42), said
elevator cup being movable in an axial path by relative

rotation of said innerbody (50) and cam sleeve (30);

   wherein said cam sleeve base (34) has a base wall
(36) with a relaxation zone (80) formed of a deformable

polymeric material therein, said relaxation zone
(80) having a thinner wall thickness

than remaining portions of said base wall;
and a resilient friction tab (76) formed with said

innerbody (50) and frictionally engaging and bearing
against said base wall (36) of said cam sleeve (30) such

that said tab (76) is flexed radially inwardly from a tab
root (77) joining the tab (76) to the innerbody (50),

said tab (76) being released from said inward flexing
when said tab (76) is seated in said relaxation zone (80)

in said base wall (36) by deformation of said relaxation
zone (80) by application of pressure thereto by said tab

(76). 
A cosmetic dispenser in accordance with claim
1, wherein said relaxation zone (80) is located such that

said tab (76) is seated in said relaxation zone (80) when
said dispenser (20) is in a retracted position.
A cosmetic dispenser in accordance with claim
1, wherein said relaxation zone (80) is located such that

said tab (76) is seated in said relaxation zone (80) when
said dispenser (20) is in an extended position.
A cosmetic dispenser in accordance with claim
1, 2 or 3, wherein flat areas (84) are provided on an

outer wall (86) of said cam sleeve (34) to obtain said
thinner wall thickness of said relaxation zones (80).
A cosmetic dispenser in accordance with claim
1, 2, 3, or 4, wherein there is a single resilient tab

(76) and two of said relaxation zones (80).
A cosmetic dispenser in accordance with claim
4, wherein said relaxation zones (80) are located 180

degrees apart on said base wall (36).
