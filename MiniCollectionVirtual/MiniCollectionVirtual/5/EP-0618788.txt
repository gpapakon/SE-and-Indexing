<ABSTRACT>
A dynamic postural stability splint in the form of a garment (10), the garment comprising a plurality of pieces of flexible elastic material connected together to form the garment (10). Selected pieces (12) of the flexible elastic material are configured and positioned in the garment (10) so as to provide lines of pull (14) on the wearer's body in predetermined directions whereby, in use, the garment (10) can help to improve postural stability of the wearer. The dynamic splint is particularly advantageous in its application to children and adolescents with cerebral palsy. The garment may take the form of a body suit (10), or be designed for individual limbs of the wearer in the form of a hand splint, arm splint, leg splint, etc. A method of manufacturing a dynamic splint and a method of treating postural instability are also described.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
a method of
manufacturing
a dynamic postural stability splint in the form of a garment
and relates particularly, though not
exclusively, to such a garment for assisting in controlling
involuntary muscle movement and providing postural stability
for a wearer with cerebral palsy or other neurological
dysfunction.Throughout this specification the terms "posture" and
"postural" are used in a general sense to refer to the relative
position of parts of the body, whether considered in relation
to the body as a whole or in relation to isolated anatomical
structures.The present invention will be described with
particular reference to its application to people with brain
damage syndromes referred to as cerebral palsy. However, it
is to be understood that the dynamic postural stability splint
manufactured according to the invention has wider application such as, for
example, in assisting persons with temporary or permanent
neuromotor disabilities. It is thought the dynamic postural
stability splint can help improve muscle tone of the trunk and
extremities and also decrease the degree of associated
involuntary movement. Throughout this specification the term
"tone" refers to the resistance within muscles to both passive
and active movement. Hypotonia is a condition of under
activity in the muscle and hypertonia is a condition of over
activity in the muscle. Because cerebral palsy is non-reversible,
therapy must focus on means of circumventing the
effects of the cerebral lesion by surgical, medical or physical
interventions. Various types of orthotic devices have been
used with a view to preventing orthopaedic complications and
functional enhancement, for example, braces and splints which
provide support and/or immobilise parts of the wearer's body.A typical prior art thermoplastic splint is 
moulded to suit the shape of the wearer's body and provides
static support and effectively immobilises part of the
body. There are a number of disadvantages of the
conventional static splint. Firstly, the splint does not
allow dynamic movement of the part of the body supported by
the splint and hence the problem of muscle tone is not
adequately addressed. Secondly, the splint is
uncomfortable and hot to wear and doesn't allow the skin to
breath freely, hence there is a tendency to sweat leading
to discomfort, unpleasant body odours and skin maceration
and damage. Furthermore, the thermoplastic material tends
to soften in hot weather and thus loses its shape.US-A-4593697 discloses a posture brace

<CLAIMS>
A method of manufacturing a dynamic postural stability
splint in the form of a garment (10) for a particular

wearer with anatomical anomalies caused by neurological
dysfunction, the method comprising the steps of:


obtaining the appropriate body measurements of the
wearer including selected circumferential measurements;
assessing the posture and tone of the particular
wearer and prescribing correctional lines of pull

for the wearer's body in predetermined direction required
to reduce involuntary muscle movement and thereby to improve

the postural stability of the wearer;
selecting an appropriate flexible elastic material for
the garment;
reducing the circumferential measurements to obtain
the desired firmness of the finished garment on the wearer

depending upon age, vascularity, medical condition, degree
of involuntary movement and lifestyle considerations;
designing a pattern for the garment based on the body
measurements obtained including configuring and positioning

selected pieces (12) of the pattern so as to provide, in
the finished garment, said lines of pull on the wearer's

body in predetermined directions, said lines of pull (14)
being applied by the selected pieces (12) through skin

contact to underlying muscle tissue from a point of origin
to a point of insertion of an affected muscle or muscle

group, thereby assisting the affected muscle or muscle
group in its normal function; and
constructing the garment from said flexible elastic
material using the pattern thus obtained whereby, in use,

the finished garment can help to improve postural stability
of the wearer.
A method of manufacturing a dynamic postural stability
splint as claimed in claim 1, wherein said step of

designing the pattern for the garment (10) comprises
designing a base pattern for the garment and designing

separate pattern pieces for the shape and configuration of 
the selected pieces (12) overlaying the base pattern as

reinforcement panels.
A method of manufacturing a dynamic postural stability
splint as claimed in claim 2, wherein the selected pieces

(12) are cut from the flexible elastic material with the
grain of the material lying substantially perpendicular to

the desired direction of the lines of pull in the finished
garment.
A method of manufacturing a dynamic postural stability
splint as claimed in claim 3, wherein the selected pieces

(14) are cut from a first flexible elastic material and the
remainder of the garment (10) is cut from a second flexible

elastic material wherein the first material has a higher
coefficient or modulus of elasticity than the second

material.
