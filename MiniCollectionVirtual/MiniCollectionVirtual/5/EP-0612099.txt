<ABSTRACT>
The electrode-less high pressure discharge lamp has a lamp vessel (1) 
which is surrounded by an electric coil (2) having turns (3). End portions (4, 5) of the 

coil are electrically connected to current conductors (6, 7). The turns of the coil are 
supported by aluminium nitride (8), which is in thermal contact with the current 

conductors. There is a good heat transfer from the coil to the conductors, keeping the 
coil relatively cool and efficient. The coil does screen the lamp vessel to a small extent 

only, thereby improving the lamp efficacy.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an electrodeless high-pressure discharge lamp 
comprising: 
a light-transmitting lamp vessel which is closed in a vacuumtight manner 
and which has an ionizable filling; around the lamp vessel, an electric coil having turns along at least one plane through 
the lamp vessel, which coil has end portions which are electrically connected to current 
conductors which are to be connected to an electric supply. Such an electrodeless high-pressure discharge lamp is known from 
US-A-5,042,139. The coil of the known lamp is built up from voluminous, for example 
solid turns. The result of this is that a comparatively large surface area of the lamp 
vessel is screened off from its surroundings. Light generated in the lamp vessel as a 
result cannot freely emerge, which reduces the luminous efficacy of the lamp. This 
disadvantage also holds for a coil whose upper and lower turns have a conical upper and 
lower surface, respectively. It is to be prevented that the coil assumes a comparatively high 
temperature, and thus a comparatively high electric resistance, owing to current passage 
and radiation from the lamp vessel. A higher electric resistance would cause the ohmic 
losses to increase, and as a result also the temperature. 
To remove heat from the coil, the known coil may have hollow turns through which 
water is circulated. The screening of generated light, however, is not counteracted by 
this modification, while the modification has the disadvantage of additional provisions, 
i.e. the water supply and drain, as well as the energy consumption thereof. US-A-4,910,439 discloses an electrodeless high-pressure discharge lamp of 
the kind mentioned in the opening paragraph in which a forced air current cools the 
electric coil. Apart from the screening of the lamp vessel, this lamp has the  
 
disadvantage that a motor and supply lines are necessary for cooling, and also that 
energy is required for this. A disadvantage of a mechanical cooling is, furthermore, that maintenance 
is required for it and that the life of the cooling drive may be the factor which limits 
lamp life in the case of a lamp capable of burning a few tens of thousands of hours. US-A-4,871,946 discloses an electrodeless high-pressure discharge lamp 
whose coil is helicoidally wound against the by the vessel. Here the coil not only 
intercepts light, but is also strongly heated by the discharge vessel, whereby its 
resistance increases. Copper is particularly suitable as a material for the coil because of its 
high
