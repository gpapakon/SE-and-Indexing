<DESCRIPTION>
In recent years all-purpose liquid detergents have become widely accepted for
cleaning hard surfaces, e.g., painted woodwork and panels, tiled walls, wash bowls,
bathtubs, linoleum or tile floors, washable wall paper, etc.. Such all-purpose liquids
comprise clear and opaque aqueous mixtures of water-soluble synthetic organic
detergents and water-soluble detergent builder salts. In order to achieve comparable
cleaning efficiency with granular or powdered all-purpose cleaning compositions, use of
water-soluble inorganic phosphate builder salts was favored in the prior art all-purpose
liquids. For example, such early phosphate-containing compositions are described in
U.S. Patent Nos. 2,560,839; 3,234,138; 3,350,319; and British Patent No. 1,223,739.In view of the environmentalist's efforts to reduce phosphate levels in ground
water, improved all-purpose liquids containing reduced concentrations of inorganic
phosphate builder salts or non-phosphate builder salts have appeared. A particularly
useful self-opacified liquid of the latter type is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,244,840.However, these prior art all-purpose liquid detergents containing detergent
builder salts or other equivalent tend to leave films, spots or streaks on cleaned
unrinsed surfaces, particularly shiny surfaces. Thus, such liquids require thorough
rinsing of the cleaned surfaces which is a time-consuming chore for the user.In order to overcome the foregoing disadvantage of the prior art all-purpose
liquid, U.S. Patent No. 4,017,409 teaches that a mixture of paraffin sulfonate and a
reduced concentration of inorganic phosphate builder salt should be employed.
However, such compositions are not completely acceptable from an environmental
point of view based upon the phosphate content. On the other hand, another
alternative to achieving phosphate-free all-purpose liquids has been to use a major
proportion of a mixture of anionic and nonionic detergents with minor amounts of glycol
ether solvent and organic amine as shown in U.S. Patent NO. 3,935,130. Again, this
approach has not been completely satisfactory and the high levels of organic 
detergents necessary to achieve cleaning cause foaming which, in turn, leads to the
need for thorough rinsing which has been found to be undesirable to today's
consumers.Another approach to formulating hard surfaced or all-purpose liquid detergent
composition where product homogeneity and clarity are important considerations
involves the formation of oil-in-water (o/w) microemulsions which contain one or
