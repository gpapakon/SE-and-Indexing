<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a fuel injection nozzle for internal combustion engines with a nozzle body (3) in which a valve seat is formed and a valve needle (5) is displaceably guided, which is acted upon by a closing spring (8, 11) and in the opposite direction thereto by the fuel pressure and in the opening lift moves counter to the direction of flow of the fuel, and with a nozzle holder (1), to which the nozzle body (3) is fixed and which has a chamber (12) for accommodation of the closing spring (8, 11) and for the accommodation of a sensor for detecting the movement of the valve needle (5). The aim of the invention is to build the sensor smaller with at least the same accuracy as comparable known designs so as to be able to make the overall injection nozzle small. According to the invention this is achieved in that a sensor needle (16) coupled to the valve needle (5) immerses into the chamber (12), which sensor needle carries a reflective surface (17), onto which an antenna (18), fixed to the nozzle holder (1), emits an RF signal and the reflected signal received by the antenna (18) is fed to a control module for the fuel supply. A sensing of the start of fuel injection, at least as accurate as in injection nozzles with considerably more expensive sensors of larger design, is thereby achieved for minimal additional overall height of the injection nozzle.
