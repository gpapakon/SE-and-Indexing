 ACID-TO-ALKALINE PAPERMAKING PROCESSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONl. Field of the InventionThis invention relates to a fundamentally new papermakin process, based on a fundamentally new flocculation mechanis different from charge-neutralization or polymer-bridging know in the prior art. Specifically, this invention relates to a process for th manufacture of novel and improved paper, board and other wet laid products from furnishes comprising cellulosic and/or syn thetic fibers, optionally also comprising inorganic and organ ic filler pigments, water-soluble and water-disperse polyme adhesives, color dyes and other adjuvants, treated with com plex functional microgel cements.The complex functional microgel cements are synthesize in situ (in the furnish) from transient, chemically reactiv subcolloidal sodium-silico-aluminate or similar hydrosol cross-linked with bivalent and/or multivalent inorganic salts optionally also using organic, cationically active chemica compounds having at least two reactive groups in each molecul as auxiliary (additional) cross-linking agents.2. Discussion of the Relevant ArtPaper, as a web of cellulosic fibers, is made in princi ple by dewatering aqueous suspensions (furnishes) of partiall crushed (refined) cellulosic fibers on stationary or movin screens and drying the resultant screen residue.The quality of paper products made in the above manne would obviously be unacceptable for most of today's applica tions; hence, modern papermaking furnishes usually consist o blends of selected species of cellulosic fibers, refined t 

precisely defined standards; mineral and/or plastic fille pigments; dyes; sizing agents; strength-enhancing polymers and so forth, the resultant webs being appropriately finished To obtain satisfactory retention of solids from such comple furnishes on rapidly moving and vibrating forming screens o modern paper machines, these furnishes must be flocculated i a controlled manner with the aid of appropriate colloid-chem ical mechanisms. The type of flocculation-controlling mecha nism depends on the system of chemical agents ("wet-end che icals") specific to the papermaking process employed.As is readily understood by those skilled in the art there can be only as many principal, fundamentally differen papermaking processes as there are principal, fundamentall different flocculation mechanisms, the only two such floccula tion mechanisms known in the prior art being based on eithe charge neutralization or polymer bridging. Accordingly, th two principal
