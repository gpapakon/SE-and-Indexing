<ABSTRACT>
A process for preparing, on an industrial scale, 
4-halo-5(hydroxymethyl) 

imidazole compounds, shown below, that are useful 
as intermediates for medicines. A 4-halo-5(hydroxymethyl) 

imidazole compound is prepared by reacting a 4,5-bis(hydroxymethyl) 
imidazole compound with a halogenating 

agent such as an N-chlorosuccinimide, an N-bromosuccinimide 
or a chlorinated isocyanuric acid compound. 


wherein R is a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group, an aryl group or an 
aralkyl group, and X is a halogen atom.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention provides a process of producing 4-halo-5-(hydroxymethyl) 
imidazole compounds that are useful as 
intermediates of medicines such as hypotensive drugs and 
the like. The 4-halo-5-(hydroxymethyl) imidazole compound can 
be converted upon oxidation with manganese dioxide or the 
like into a 4-halo-5-formylimidazole compound. The 4-halo-5-(hydroxymethyl) imidazole compound has 
heretofore been synthesized by reacting a 
5-(hydroxymethyl) imidazole compound 
with a halogenating agent such as an 
N-chlorosuccinimide to halogenate the position 4 of an 
imidazole ring. For instance, Japanese Patent 
Publication No. 64428/1988 (equivalent to EP-A-0,028,834) discloses a 
4-chloro-5-(hydroxymethyl) imidazole compound synthesized 
by the above-mentioned method and having at the position 2 
thereof an n-propyl group, an n-butyl group, a t-butyl 
group, a cyclopentyl group, an m-butoxyphenyl group, a 
p-methylphenyl group, a p-methoxyphenyl group and a 
p-chlorophenyl group, and Japanese Laid-Open Patent 
Publication No. 23868/1988 (equivalent to EP-A-0,253,310) discloses a 
4-chloro-5-(hydroxymethyl) imidazole compound having an 
n-heptyl group and a methoxyethyl group at the position 2 
thereof. The 5-(hydroxymethyl) imidazole compound used as a 
starting material in the above-mentioned method is 
prepared by a method of reacting an iminoester compound 
with a dihydroxyacetone in the liquid ammonia or by a  
 
method of reducing a 5-formylimidazole compound with a 
sodium borohydride. According to the former method, the 
starting material is handled with difficulty, the reaction 
apparatus becomes complex, the yield is low and the cost 
of production is high. The latter method, on the other 
hand, uses the 5-formylimidazole compound which is an 
expensive starting material. In either case, therefore, 
synthesis of the 4-halo-5-(hydroxymethyl) imidazole 
compound by using the 5-(hydroxymethyl) imidazole compound 
as a starting material, is not practicable. The object of the present invention is to provide a 
process which is capable of inexpensively mass-producing a 
4-halo-5-(hydroxymethyl) imidazole compound by using a 
4,5-bis(hydroxymethyl) imidazole compound that is easily 
obtained by the reaction of an imidazole compound 
with a formaldehyde. The present invention provides a process for 
producing a 4-halo-5-(hydroxymethyl) imidazole compound of 
formula (I)
