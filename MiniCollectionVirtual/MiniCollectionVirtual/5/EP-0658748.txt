<ABSTRACT>
A test circuit for testing operation of a liquid level detector. The liquid level 
detector (10) includes a probe (20) that is placed at a test site. A control circuit (16) 

monitors changes in capacitance of the probe due to changes in the liquid level at the test 
site. A test switch (30) grounds an input to the probe which and causes the control circuit 

to sense an alarm condition. If the detector does not activate an alarm when the test switch 
is actuated, the detector is not properly functioning and repair or replacement of the level 

detector is needed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a liquid level monitoring circuit and, more
particularly, a test feature of the monitoring circuit that allows operation of the
circuit to be confirmed.Robertshaw Controls Co., assignee of the present invention, sells a liquid
level sensor for detecting the presence or absence of a liquid and providing an
output that activates an alarm. This prior art sensor is sold under the designation
Mini-Tek 800. The Mini-Tek 800 sensor has a probe that determines a liquid level
at a probe site by monitoring capacitance changes caused by changes in liquid
level.U.S. Patent No. 4,224,606 discloses a fluid level control circuit having a test
function. Pressing a test switch reduces voltage at an FET gate and takes the FET
from a pinched-off condition allowing a drain capacitor to discharge through the
FET. This drops a relay out of the circuit and closes an alarm contact to actuate
an alarm.U.S. Patent No. 4,676,100 discloses a test circuit for simulating a "high"
material level in an LC resonant frequency fluid level indicator. Closing a switch
activates a second switch and adds three capacitor, in parallel with the prohe.
The increased capacitance causes a threshold detector to indicate a "high" material
level.U.S. Patent No. 5,121,632 discloses a sensor including a self-diagnostic
routine which connects the probe to a comparator that compares the voltage on
the probe to a supply voltage. Under normal conditions, the variable capacitance
of the probe will charge up to a supply voltage. If the probe is shorted, then the
variable capacitor will not charge up and cause the output of the comparator to be
high to flag an error condition on a microprocessor controller.The present invention concerns a test circuit for use in conjunction with a
sensor such as the prior art Mini-Tek 800. A test input allows an operator to 
artificially simulate a condition which normally would cause the circuit to activate
an alarm. By activating the test input, the circuit's operation can be confirmed.The present invention includes a level detector according to claim 1
that includes a first charging
circuit having a probe that can be placed at a liquid detection site and that charges
at a rate dependent upon the liquid level at the detection site. A second reference
charging circuit conducts charge at a rate independent of the liquid level at the
detection site. A control circuit compares the rate of charging of the first and
second charging circuits and produces a detector output signal based upon the
compari
