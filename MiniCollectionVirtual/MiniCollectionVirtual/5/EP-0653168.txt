<ABSTRACT>
A process for the efficient preparation of a sliced fish 
product, for example Seelachs slices, having a uniform size 

and consistent salt content; wherein the slices are 
obtained from frozen deep-skinned fish fillet blocks.

<DESCRIPTION>
A process for the efficient preparation of a sliced fish 
product having a uniform size and having a consistently 
uniform salt content. Sliced fish products for example "Seelachs slices" are 
currently manufactured from large (Grade I/II) fish fillets 
having a weight of greater than 3.0 kg and preferably a 
weight of greater than 4.5 kg. These fish fillets are 
salted at 10Â°C for 3 to 4 weeks until the salt 
concentration contained in the cell water of the fish is 
from 22 to 26%. Generally the ratio of salt:fish used is 
1:2 (w/w). The fish are then washed and the belly flaps 
removed before cutting into suitable lengths. These 
lengths are then sliced, coloured and desalted, smoked, 
dried and packaged. However, this process has many disadvantages, for example 
it is becoming increasingly difficult to obtain fish 
fillets of a suitable size, the salt concentration of the 
final sliced product may vary largely within each fish 
slice, and the yield is very poor. It is therefore highly desirable to be able to manufacture 
a product of a similar or higher quality using a process 
which does not have these problems. GB 1 387 117 (Unilever Ltd) describes a process for the 
preparation of slices of fish comprising:  
 
(a) contacting the raw fish fillets with salt to provide 
salted fish fillets containing from 3 to 20% salt expressed 
on a weight basis; (b) coating the salted fillets with 5 to 50% by weight of 
a binder comprising finely divided substantially bone-free 
raw fish muscle mixed with from 1 to 10% salt, and from 3 
to 8% food grade phosphate; and (c) moulding the binder-coated fillets to form integral 
blocks of uniform weight shape and size. We have, however, now surprisingly discovered that it is 
possible to form blocks of fish fillets which adhere 
sufficiently well together without the requirement to salt 
the fillets prior to freezing and also without the 
requirement to provide a binder. Thus a much simpler 
process for providing high quality fish slices is disclosed 
which enables fish fillets having a uniform salt 
concentration to be produced with minimum waste. The fish 
fillets may also be sourced from smaller fish than the 
conventional process. It is essential, however, that the 
fish fillets are deep-skinned prior to being frozen into 
the fish block. By deep-skinned is meant that all the 
brown flesh from underneath the skin is removed. Such a 
deep-skinning process is essential in order to provide a 
sliced product which adheres together without the 
requirement for binder

<CLAIMS>
A process for the preparation of a sliced fish product 
comprising: 


(a) freezing fish fillets from the 
Gadus
 family into a 
block of uniform shape wherein the fish fillets are deep-skinned 

prior to freezing into the block; 
(b) salting the block such that a salt concentration of 
from 22 to 26% is obtained within the fish cell water; 
(c) slicing; and 
(d) desalting the fish slices to a salt concentration of 
from 8 to 10%. 
A process according to claim 1 wherein the fish slices 
are additionally coloured. 
A process according to claim 1 or 2 wherein the fish 
slices are additionally smoked. 
A process according to claim 1 and claim 2 wherein the 
desalting and colouring steps are conducted simultaneously. 
A process according to any preceding claim wherein the 
fish slices are desalted to a salt concentration of from 8 

to 9%. 
A process according to any preceding claim wherein the 
fish slices are desalted to a salt concentration of 

approximately 8%. 
A process according to any preceding claim wherein the 
deep-skinned fish fillets are frozen such that the fillets 

are orientated in the same direction.  
 
A process according to any preceding claim wherein the 
ratio of fish to salt used during the salting step (b) is 

approximately 1:2. 
A process according to any preceding claim wherein the 
salting step (b) is conducted at ambient temperature. 
A process according to any preceding claim wherein the 
fish is saithe.
