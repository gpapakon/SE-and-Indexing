<ABSTRACT>
A cooking vessel having an aluminium base plate and a ferromagnetic insert, heatable by an induction field, in the base. The technical problem is to design a cooking vessel which can be used in an induction heating field such that the insert contributes to the stabilisation and reinforcement of the cooking vessel. As insert, a ring (5) made of a ferromagnetic substance is let into an annular groove (4) of the aluminium base plate (2).

<CLAIMS>
Cooking vessel (1) comprising a bottom plate made of aluminum and an insert in the bottom 
plate which consists of a ferromagnetic material and can be heated by an induction field, characterized in 

that the insert is in the form of a ring (5) made of a ferromagnetic material and is embedded into a ring 
groove (4) of the bottom plate (2) made of aluminum amd that the edges of the ring groove (4) overlap 

the ring (5) in the form of beaded edges (6). 
Cooking vessel according to claim 1, characterized in that the ring (5) consits of sheet iron. 
Cooking vessel according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the depth of the ring groove (4) 
is between 20 and 40 % greater than the thickness of the ring (5).
