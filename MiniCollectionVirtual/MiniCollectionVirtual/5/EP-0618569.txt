<ABSTRACT>
A focusing servo system comprises a signal generating unit (7), a focusing servo unit 
(9), a zero crossing detecting unit, a search signal generating unit and a system 

controller (11). The signal generating unit (7) generates a focus error signal on the 
basis of the position of an objective lens (3a), through which a light beam is projected 

on an optical recording medium (1), with respect to a direction perpendicular to the 
recording surface of the optical recording medium (1) by using the reflected light beam 

from the recording surface of the optical recording medium (1), a read signal 
representing information read from the optical recording medium (1) on the basis of the 

reflected light beam and a focus acquisition enable range signal representing a focus 
acquisition enable range on the basis
 of the read signal. The focusing servo unit (9) 
receives the focus error signal from the signal generating unit (7) and executes a 

focusing servo control operation for focusing the objective lens (3a) on the basis of the 
focus error signal. The zero crossing detecting unit receives the focus error signal from 

the signal generating unit and detects a zero crossing point in the focus error signal. 
The search signal generating unit generates a down-search signal and an up-search 

signal respectively for driving the objective lens (3a) for movement toward and away 
from the recording surface of the optical recording medium (1). The system controller 

receives the focus acquisition enable range signal from the signal generating unit and a 
zero crossing detection signal from the zero crossing detecting unit, selectively supplies 

the search signals generated by the search signal generating means and the focus error 
signal generated by the signal generating unit (7) to the focusing servo unit, and 

executes a control operation on the basis of the focus acquisition enable range signal 
received from the signal generating means (7) and the zero crossing detection signal 

received from the zero crossing detecting unit to supply the focus error signal provided 
by the signal generating means instead of the search signal provided by the search signal 

generating unit in a predetermined time after the start of the movement of the objective  
 

lens (3a) away from the recording surface of the optical recording medium (1) during 
the movement of the objective lens (3a) from its initial position away from the 

recording surface of the optical recording medium (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a focusing
servo system and a focusing servo acquisition enable
method and, more particularly, to a focusing servo
system for an optical recording/reproducing apparatus,
and a focusing servo acquisition enable method.In an optical recording apparatus for
recording information on a disk-shaped recording medium,
such as an optical disk or a magnetooptic disk, or an
optical reproducing apparatus for reproducing
information recorded on a recording medium, the light
beam emitted by an optical head must be focused
correctly on the recording surface of the recording
disk. Therefore, the optical recording apparatus or the
optical reproducing apparatus is provided with a
focusing servo system which drives the objective lens of
the optical head for movement toward and away from the
recording surface of the recording disk. Since a range
in which a focusing servo action is possible, i.e., a
focus acquisition enable range, is comparatively narrow, 
the objective lens is moved into the focus acquisition
enable range by a focus search operation at the start of
recording/reproducing operation or after track access,
and then a focusing servo loop is turned on to carry out
the focusing servo action. When starting recording
operation or reproducing operation, spindle servo action
and tracking servo action are executed after a focus
search action and a focusing servo action have been
executed. After the starting procedure has been
completed, the scanning operation of the light beam for
recording or reproducing is possible.During the focus search operation, for
example, the objective lens is moved forcibly between a
position farthest form the surface of the disk and a
position nearest to the surface of the disk, in which a
focus error signal EF represented by an S-shaped curve
in Fig. 1(b) is obtained by processing the output of the
four-division detector of the optical head for detecting
reflected light. Fig. 1(a) shows the sum signal, i.e.,
a signal RF, of the four-division detector. The signal
RF is compared with a given threshold Th to obtain a FOK
signal as shown in Fig. 1(c), which indicates a focusing
servo enable range. After the objective lens is moved
into the focus acquisition enable range corresponding to 
a period H in which the FOK signal is HIGH by the focus
search operation, the focusing servo system is actuated
for correct focusing control; that is, focusing servo
control is executed to adjust the objective lens to the
trailing edge of a focus zero crossing detection signal
