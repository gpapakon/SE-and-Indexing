<ABSTRACT>
A dental implant assembly (10) is provided, as well as a 
system and method for exposing an embedded implant after 

osseointegration has taken place. The implant assembly (10) 
comprises an implant member (12) for embedding in the jaw and a 

rest factor member (18) for securing to the implant member, the 
rest factor member having an upper rest surface (42) just above 

the tissue level for opposing an overlying portion of a 
prosthesis (24) anchored elsewhere in the jaw to form a 

non-retentive rest or support for accepting down pressure 
from the prosthesis. The implant member (12) is relatively 

short and can be installed in distal jaw regions without 
interference with the mandibular nerve. A bore (14) is cut out 

in the jaw (16) for receiving the implant, inserting the implant 
and an attached healing screw (70) in the implant. The implant 

site is closed and osseointegration takes place over an 
extended period. Subsequently, the implant site is 

uncovered, the healing screw is removed, and the rest 
factor member (18) is secured in the implant.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a dental implant
system.Dental implants are embedded in the jaw bone and serve
to anchor one or more artificial teeth or dentures. Most
implant systems involve a relatively long implant cylinder
which is placed into a custom bored hole in the jawbone,
then left for several months to allow healing and bone
integration. Then the implant must be exposed for
attachment of a dental prosthetic appliance such as a
crown, denture, partial denture or bridge. This generally
involves the dentist cutting out a flap of tissue which is
peeled back to expose the implant, and secured by sutures
after installing the prosthesis. This results in a
relatively large area of trauma with a certain degree of
pain to the patient and risk of post-operative infection.Another problem with conventional implants is their
length, which makes them difficult to implant in the distal
jaw region, where there is insufficient depth to enable
their insertion without interference with the mandibular
nerve, without the assistance of a dental surgeon to locate
the precise position of the nerve and ensure that the
implant does not interfere with it. A shorter cylindrical 
implant would not normally be suitable since it would
provide insufficient "hold" and would likely become
loosened with time if anchored to a denture or bridge.
Also, side to side forces on the implant lead to bone
erosion and trauma. Thus, dentures or bridges are often
not anchored at the rear of the jaw. However, this has
the disadvantage that trauma to the tissue and underlying
bone beneath the denture occurs as a result of the denture
repeatedly impacting the bone, particularly with long
dentures which will tend to tilt or rotate about their
attachment to anchor points during chewing or other jaw
motions. This biting pressure can result in bone erosion
or resorption down to the level of the nerve.EP-A-0288702 discloses a submersible screw-type
dental implant including an implanted anchor portion and
an abutment to support an artificial tooth. The anchor
portion has a single lead thread with machined grooves,
and a longitudinal central channel which directs bone
chips towards the base of a bore in the patient's bone in
which the implant is installed.It is an object of this invention to provide an
improved dental implant system and method which is less
likely to cause significant tissue trauma and which
reduces bone erosion as a result of denture wear.It is a further object of this invention to provide
an improved system and method for
