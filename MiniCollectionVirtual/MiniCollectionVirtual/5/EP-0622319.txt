<ABSTRACT>
A stacker assembly receives signatures and supports 
the signatures as an intermediate stack is formed. A 

jogger assembly engages an intermediate stack supported by 
the stacker assembly to accurately align edge portions of 

the signatures. The stacks of signatures are deposited 
onto a turntable to form a main stack. The turntable 

rotates the main stack to offset relatively thick folded 
edge portions of signatures. The stacker assembly includes 

a plurality of slats which are moved along a first 
continuous circuitous path by a first drive assembly. The 

stacker assembly also includes a plurality of slats which 
are moved along a second continuous circuitous path by a 

second drive assembly. The drive assemblies move the slats 
along the continuous circuitous paths with the longitudinal 

axes of the slats horizontal and parallel. The jogger 
assembly has jogger plates which extend into central 

portions of the continuous circuitous paths along which the 
slats are moved by the drive assemblies.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an apparatus 
for use in stacking signatures according to the preamble of claim 1. An apparatus which receives signatures, forms 
intermediate stacks of signatures and deposits the 
intermediate stacks of signatures on a main stack of 
signatures is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,068,567, 
issued January 17, 1978 and entitled "Combined Ejector-Gate 
Means for Rotatable Table of an Article Counter-Stacker". 
The apparatus disclosed in this patent includes a stacker 
section which receives newspapers. The newspapers are 
stacked on cooperating pairs of upwardly angled blades 
carried on endless chains. A stack supporting table is 
disposed beneath the stacker section and receives stacks of 
signatures from the stacker section. The table is 
rotatable to offset relatively thick folded edge portions  
 
of the signatures received from the stacker section. 
Apparatus for use in forming stacks of signatures is also 
disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,532,230; 3,599,807; 
4,183,704; and 4,678,387. Moreover, GB-A-2 063 224 discloses an apparatus for 
stacking sheet material according to the preamble of Claim 1. 
This apparatus comprises first and 
second pluralities of longitudinally extending signature 
support elements. Further, it comprises first drive means 
for moving the first plurality of signature support 
elements along a first circuitous path, and second drive 
means for moving the second plurality of signature supports 
elements along a second circuitous path. The second 
circuitous path is separate from the first circuitous path. 
Each signature support element has surface means for 
engaging a lower side of a stack of signatures to support 
the stack of signatures. The present invention relates to a new and improved 
apparatus for use in stacking signatures of the kind 
referred to above. Thus, according to the invention, the 
apparatus further includes jogger means for jogging a stack 
of signatures supported by one of the signature support 
elements of the first plurality of signature support 
elements and one of the signature support elements of the 
second plurality of signature support elements. The jogger 
means includes a first jogger plate engageable with a first  
 
end portion of a stack of signatures, a second jogger plate 
engageable with a second end portion of the stack of 
signatures, and means for moving the first and second 
jogger plates relative to the stack of signatures. The 
first circuitous path extends around the first jogger plate 
and the second
