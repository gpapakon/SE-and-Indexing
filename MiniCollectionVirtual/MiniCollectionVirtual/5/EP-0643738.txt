<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD TO SYNTHESIZE CARBON-CARBON COMPOSITESThis invention relates to carbon-carbon composites and processes for making them. Carbon-carbon composites contain reinforcing carbon fibers in a carbon matrix.They are used in structural applications because of their low weight, good strength and excellent thermal properties.Carbon-carbon composites suffer in that they are difficult and time consuming to fabricate. Fabrication and properties of carbon-carbon composites are explained in numerous published references, such as: Savage, "Carbon-carbon Composite Materials," Metals and Materials 544-548 (1988) and Schmidt, "Carbon/carbon Composites", SAMPE Journal 9-19 (1972). The two most common methods of making carbon-carbon composites are chemical vapor deposition and liquid impregnation.In chemical vapor deposition, a substrate of carbon fibers is heated by induction and then contacted with hydrocarbon gas, so that the gas decomposes to a deposited carbon (which is deposited on the substrate) and hydrogen gas. The temperature of the substrate is usually 590°C to 1500°C. The hydrocarbon gas is frequently a C-i- β alkane, such as methane. The technique requires many repeated cycles of heating and deposition, so that total process times of 2000 hours are not uncommon. 'n liquid impregnation, the substrate is impregnated with a carbonizable resin(such as a phenolic resin, pitch or tar) to form an organic matrix composite. Then the matrix material is carbonized by heating the composite to very high temperatures (1000°C to 2800°C). The process of impregnation and carbonization is usually repeated 4 to 12 times to eliminate voids, since the char yield of the carbonizable resin is usually very low. Since impregnation frequently requires 20 hours, the process usually takes several days.If a very high quantity of carbon can be generated on the first cycle, then the number of subsequent cycles can be reduced, and the time to make a good composite can be shortened. What is needed is a process to make a carbon-carbon composite that can deposit very high level of carbon in a single step. The present invention is a process to make a carbon-carbon composite in which a matrix composite, which contains fibers embedded in an organic matrix material, is heated to a temperature and for a time sufficient to convert the organi . matrix material to carbon, characterized in that the organic matrix material is <otr . c liquid-crystalline polybenzoxazole or polybenzothiazole polymer or copolymer. The method can be used to synthesize
