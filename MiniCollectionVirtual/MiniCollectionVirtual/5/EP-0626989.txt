<ABSTRACT>
Contacting an olefins-containing feed gas stream in a front-end heat-pumped deethanizer or depropanizer to remove the C3+ or C4+ compounds, selectively hydrogenating the overhead stream to significantly reduce the acetylene and diolefins content, dehydrating the reactor effluent to remove traces of moisture, feeding the dehydrated stream to an intercooled and reboiled demethanizing absorber to produce a rich solvent containing ethylene and heavier hydrocarbons, separating the rich solvent in a solvent regenerator into an overhead stream of ethylene and heavier hydrocarbons and a bottom lean solvent stream for recycle to the demethanizing absorber, feeding the absorber overhead stream to an autorefrigerated recovery unit to additionally recover a demethanized C2+ stream, recover excess solvent and produce a fuel gas stream, combining the overhead of the solvent regenerator with the C2+ stream and feeding the combined stream to a deethanizer which produces an overhead stream that is split into ethylene as product and ethane for recycling to the cracker.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to treating hydrocarbon gases, 
such as cracked gases and refinery off-gases for recovering 
one or more desirable components. Thermal cracking of hydrocarbon feedstocks in 
pyrolysis furnaces for production of ethylene has been an 
established technology since the 1940's. The pyrolysis 
furnace gases were cooled, compressed, sweetened, dried and 
sent to the recovery section of an ethylene plant in which 
the first fractionation column was a front-end demethanizer 
operating at about -150°C. The demethanizer bottoms were 
fed to a deethanizer, and the demethanizer overhead, rich 
in hydrogen, was fed to a cryogenic unit which recovered 
additional ethylene from the fuel gas stream. A back-end 
acetylene removal system, such as a series of two acetylene 
reactors, was typically located between the deethanizer and 
the C2 splitter. A Methyl Acetylene and Propadiene Reactor 
was located between the depropanizer and the C3 splitter. 
This arrangement caused the production of large amounts of 
green oil, a polymer formed from olefins and diolefins, 
which was likely to freeze in the C2 splitter or accumulate 
in the ethane vaporizer. By processing overhead gases from 
a heat-pumped deethanizer or depropanizer, which is coupled  
 
with a front-end catalytic acetylene hydrogenation reactor, 
the green oil problem is eliminated. Numerous processes are known in the solvent absorption 
art for isolation and recovery of olefins from cracked, 
refinery, and synthetic gases containing these unsaturated 
compounds. Some processes utilize specific paraffinic 
compounds as an absorption oil, and others utilize an 
aromatic absorption oil as a solvent within an absorber 
column or an absorber-stripper column having a reboiler. U. S. 4,743,282 of Y. R. Mehra describes a process for 
treating cracked gases which have been compressed, cooled, 
sweetened, and dried to produce a C2=+ hydrocarbons product, 
a methane-rich gas product, and a H2-rich gas product by 
successive countercurrent extraction with two lean solvents 
in separate loops. U. S. 4,832,718 of Y. R. Mehra teaches a method for 
hydrogen purification by countercurrently and successively 
extracting an olefins containing gas stream, at a pressure 
no greater than 3,448 kPa, in an ethylene extractor column 
with a solvent slip stream from at least one flashing stage 
and then with lean solvent in a methane extractor column. U. S. 5,019,143 of Y. R. Mehra describes a continuous 
process for contacting a hydrogen off-gas stream, at any
