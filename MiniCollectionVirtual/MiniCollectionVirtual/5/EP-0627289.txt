<ABSTRACT>
An injection-moulding unit has a drive unit (A) for axially displacing the injection-moulding unit in the direction of the injection axis and an injecting unit (E), arranged symmetrically with respect to the injection axis (s-s), for axially driving a rotatable conveying screw arranged in the plasticising cylinder (17). The injecting unit is connected to an injecting bridge (25), which bears the conveying means. By virtue of the fact that the drive unit (A) likewise acts symmetrically with respect to the injection axis (s-s) and is integrated into the injection-moulding unit, a moment-free nozzle contact point and a compact injection-moulding unit are obtained in a constructionally simple way.

Injection moulding unit for a plastics material injection moulding machine 
including a carrier block (10) accommodating the plasticising cylinder (17), a 

driving unit (A) for the axial displacement of the injection moulding unit in the 
direction of the injection axis (s-s) and including a mechanical injection unit 

(E) disposed symmetrically relative to the injection axis for the axial driving of 
a conveying means (72) disposed in the plasticising cylinder (17) and 

including an injection bridge (25) connected to the injection unit,
 
characterised in that the driving unit (A) also acts symmetrically relative to 

the injection axis (s-s) and is integrated in the injection moulding unit and 
that at least one electro-mechanically driven spindle of the injection unit (E) 

is configured as a hollow spindle (18), in which guide elements are guided, 
the ends of which are securable outside the injection moulding unit as an 

abutment for the axial displacement of the injection moulding unit. 
Injection moulding unit in accordance with claim 1, characterised in that 
electro-mechanically driven spindles of the driving unit (A) are formed by a 

spindle region (19a) of the guide columns (19) which are configured as guide 
elements. 
Injection moulding unit in accordance with one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the injection bridge (25) is adjustable in a small 

diameter end region (18a) of the hollow spindle (18) via an adjusting nut (30) 
and is securable via a clamping plate (14) penetrated by screws (42) 

supported at the injection bridge (25). 
Injection moulding unit in accordance with one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that driving unit (A) and injection unit (E) are securable as a 

structural unit in the carrier block (10) via retaining plates (12, 13). 
Injection moulding unit in accordance with one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that a motor (51) is disposed on the carrier block (10) for the 

axial movement of the screw and drives at least one belt pulley (41) via at 
least one belt (28), the rotation of the latter: transmitted to the nuts (11) that 

are rotatably mounted in the carrier block (10), moves the spindle (18) of the 
injection unit (E) in an axial manner. 
Injection moulding unit in accordance with one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that a driving means (75) is disposed in the region near the 

motor (51) for the rotation of the feed screw (72) and rotates the feed screw 
(72) via a belt (27a, 27b), a speed-transforming belt pulley (54, 55) being 

mounted eccentrically on the guide column (19). 
Injection moulding unit in accordance with one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the driving unit (A) is mounted so as to be axially 

displaceable in die cushions (60) against the force of springs for the 
generation of the nozzle contact pressure.  

 
Injection moulding unit in accordance with claim 7, characterised in that the 
die cushion is disposed at the guide column (19), which has a recess (19c), 

in which an end region of the rear part of the guide column (19), 
encompassing the spindle area (19a) and the guiding area (19 b) is mounted 

so as to be axially displaceable against the force of springs (63).
