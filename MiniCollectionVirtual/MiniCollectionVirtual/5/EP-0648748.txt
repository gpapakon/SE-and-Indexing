<CLAIMS>
A process for preparing 5-acetoacetylamino-2-benzimidazolone 
by continuous reaction of 5-amino-2-benzimidazolone 

with diketene, which comprises 
carrying out the reaction in the presence of a 

water-soluble (C

)-alcohol or of a mixture of this 
alcohol with water at the boiling temperature. 
The process of claim 1, wherein the alcohol used is 
methanol, ethanol, n-propanol or isopropanol. 
The process of claim 1 or 2, wherein the alcohol or 
alcohol-water mixture has a boiling point from 65째C 

to 100째C, in particular from 70째C to 90째C. 
The process of claim 1 or 2, wherein ethanol containing 
from 45 to 55% by weight of water is used. 
The process of at least one of claims 1 to 4, 
wherein the alcohol or alcohol-water mixture is used 

in the form of recirculated mother liquor.
