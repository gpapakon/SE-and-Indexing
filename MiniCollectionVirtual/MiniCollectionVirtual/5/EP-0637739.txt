<ABSTRACT>
A system and method for processing test measurements 
collected from an internal combustion engine that is cold-tested 

for diagnostic purposes. Test measurements are 
collected from an engine. The test measurements are "pre-processed" 

by filtering and subsampling techniques so that 
Principal Component Analysis can be applied to condense the 

quantity of test measurements while still retaining a 
statistically accurate indication of a majority of the 

original measurements. The pre-processed test measurements 
are then passed through one or more classifiers inc
luding: a 
Neural Network classifier (702), a Fuzzy Logic classifier 

(706), a cluster-based classifier (704) (or "Spherical" 
classifier) and a Genetic Program classifier (708). Results 

from these classifiers can be used to obtain a verdict about 
an engine (i.e., whether the engine is "normal" or 

"faulty").

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to processing test
measurements collected from a multi-cylinder internal
combustion engine to yield diagnostic results, and more
specifically to a system for processing cold-test data
collected from an internal combustion engine for optimum
determination of engine condition.Testing newly manufactured internal combustion engines
is often performed by "cold test" (i.e., cranking the engine
at a prescribed speed via an external motor, without spark
or fuel). Measurements (such as electrical signals of an
engine parameter, e.g., oil pressure, intake exhaust
pressure, crankshaft torque, etc.) are then taken from the
engine and compared to a set of known rules (e.g.,
waveforms) that have been established to represent a
properly running engine.When a particular engine part is faulty, it will
typically produce a symptom that does not match the rule,
thereby signifying it is not functioning properly. For
example, the torque waveform (analog representation) of an
engine being monitored typically produces a signature that
corresponds to compression in a particular cylinder. If
that signature does not exist, it suggests that something is
malfunctioning (e.g., a spark plug is missing or piston ring
is missing, etc.).The problem associated with performing analysis by
viewing waveforms is that rules must be established that
indicate what is a malfunctioning condition. There may be
several rules needed to identify a single problem and then
several more rules developed to diagnose the problem.
Additionally, the waveform from one problem (e.g., missing
piston ring) might look exactly the same as a distinct
problem (e.g., missing spark plug), making it very difficult
to distinguish two different problems that have like 
symptoms. As a result it is necessary to perform further
time consuming and intricate tests to isolate and identify
the underlying fault. Therefore, there is a need to
precisely distinguish faults that display very similar
symptoms without performing additional time consuming tests.Additionally, if a new fault arises that was not
considered, a rule may not exist to identify this "fault" as
a true problem. As a result defects in engines will be
missed and as a consequence can create significant post
manufacturing costs. Thus, there is a need to be able to
detect faults that deviate from any observed and known rule.Furthermore, it is time consuming to develop a
conventional system for testing an engine and performing
diagnostics. For instance, it typically takes several
months

A method for testing an internal combustion engine

method comprising the step of:

monitoring an operational parameter of the engine while
the engine is cranked at a predetermined speed for a

predetermined number of revolutions, and for producing an
electrical signal representing said operational parameter,

characterised in that said steps of said method are
carried out when the engine is cold, and in that the

method further includes the steps of plotting a value of
said electrical signal on a plot, wherein the origin of

said plot represents a predetermined non-faulty engine,
determining the distance of value from the origin, and

producing a distance signal representing the distance of
said value from the origin, the distance signal providing

an indication whether the engine is normal or faulty.
A method as claimed in claim 1, further comprising

pre-processing said electrical signal to produce a

operational parameter;
analysing said principle component value vector signal
to produce a classification signal indicating, based on

the operational parameter, whether the engine is normal or
faulty, said step of pre-processing comprising passing the

electrical signal through a median filter to produce a
median filter vector signal having a plurality of vector

points;
passing the median filter vector through an averaging
filter to produce a subsampled signal;
partitioning the subsampled signal into segments
corresponding to each cylinder event of an engine cycle to

produce N subsampled signals, wherein N is the number of
cylinders; 
passing each of the N subsampled signals through a mean
filter to produce a mean cylinder signal equal to a mean

of the N subsampled signals;
passing each of the N subsampled signals through a
standard deviation filter to produce a standard deviation

vector signal equal to the standard deviation of the N
