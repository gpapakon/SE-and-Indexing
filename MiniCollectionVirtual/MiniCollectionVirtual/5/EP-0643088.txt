<ABSTRACT>
Functional-amine polyesters have at least a first residue of a first 
monomer which is preferably a dicarboxylic acid or anydride, a second 

residue of a second monomer which is preferably a diol 
and from about 0.1 to about 10.0 mole percent of the 

residue of a functional amine. They are 
prepared by reacting the first and second monomers and 

the functional-amine in an inert atmosphere. The functional amine has a functional group 
which facilitates polymerizing the amine and the first and second 

monomers. A hydroxy group is preferred. The amine 
residue facilitates reaction of the functional-amine polyester in an 

organic peroxide cross-linking reaction system. 
The polyesters are particularly useful for electrophotographic 
toners.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is directed to functional-amine polyester polymers containing amine
residues, which exhibit greater reactivity in organic peroxide, cross-linking
polymerization
systems. The inventive resins are particularly useful for preparing low-fix
temperature, densely
cross-linked toner resins by dramatically reducing the time and temperature at which
dissociation of a crosslinking initiator occurs. The functional-amine polyesters are well suited
for toner resins made in a reactive extrusion process for use in contemporary
electrophotographic processes.Contemporary electrophotographic processes require temperatures of 160-200°C
to
fix toner on a support medium, e.g., a sheet of paper or transparency, creating a developed
image. Such high temperatures may reduce or minimize fuser roll life, such as with fuser rolls
made of silicone rubbers or fluoroelastomers (e.g., Viton®), may limit fixing speeds, may
necessitate higher power usage during operation, such as in a xerographic copier employing a
hot roll fixing mechanism.Electrophotographic toners are generally prepared by mixing or dispersing a colorant
and possibly a charge enhancing additive into a thermoplastic binder resin, followed by
micropulverization. Known thermoplastic binder resins include polystyrenes, styreneacrylic
resins, styrene-methacrylic resins, polyesters, epoxy resins, acrylics, urethanes and copolymers
thereof. Carbon black is often used as a colorant and alkyl pyridinium halides, distearyl
dimethyl ammonium methyl sulfate, and the like are employed as charge enhancing additives.Although many processes exist for fixing toner to a support medium, hot roll fixing,
transferring heat very efficiently, is especially suited for high speed electrophotographic
processes. In this method, a support medium carrying a toner image is transported between a
heated fuser roll and a pressure roll, the image face contacting the fuser roll. Upon contact
with the heated fuser roll, the toner melts and adheres to the support medium, fixing an
image.Toner fixing performance may be characterized as a function of temperature. The
lowest temperature at which the toner adheres to the support medium is called the cold offset
temperature; the maximum temperature at which the toner does not adhere to the fuser roll is
called the hot offset temperature. When the fuser temperature exceeds the hot offset
temperature, some of the molten toner adheres to the fuser roll during fixing, is transferred to
subsequent substrates (phenomenon known as "offsetting"), and
