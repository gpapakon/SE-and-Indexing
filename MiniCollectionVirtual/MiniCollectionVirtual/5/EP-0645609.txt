<ABSTRACT>
A gas meter which comprises a measuring tube through which gas 
to be supplied is fed, which tube includes two ultrasonic 

transducers between which ultrasonic signals are transmitted 
whereby gas flow is measured in dependence upon the difference 

between the time of flight of ultrasonic signals transmitted therebetween 
in opposite directions, means for measuring the gas flow 

in dependence upon the said difference between times of flight, a 
digital display operative to indicate the volume of gas used, an 

electrical power supply for driving the apparatus, an electronic 
clock in dependence upon which the said times of flight are 

measured and data interface means which facilitates the feeding 
of data to or from the meter.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to gas meters and more especially the invention
relates to electrically operated gas meters.Electrically operated gas meters per se are known and in this connection
attention is directed towards published patent applications WO-A-93/16357,
EP-A-0 505 482, EP-A-0 505 402, EP-A-0 504 304, EP-A-0 505 483 and EP-A-0
521 855 (corresponding to patent application numbers PCT/EP93/00324,
EP91902149.3, EP91900225.3, EP91902092.5, EP91902170.9, and
EP9190217.3 respectively). Whereas the above-mentioned patent applications
relate to individual improvements to electrically operated gas meters, the
present invention has in view, more especially but not exclusively, the
provision of an electrically operated gas meter which comprises a novel
combination of features whereby a plurality of advantages are
contemporaneously provided.WO-A-93/00569 relates to an electronic fluid flow meter comprising a
tube through which the fluid to be measured flows. An acoustic transducer is
located at each end of the tube for transmitting acoustic waves through the
fluid. Each transducer, in turn, acts as both an emitter and a receiver, and the
time taken for the waves to travel directly from one transducer to another
through the fluid provides an indication of the flow of the fluid being measured.
Each transducer transmits a number of ultrasonic bursts or packets in sequence
and the average travel time is determined by timing the arrival of the sequence
as a whole at the other transducer and dividing it by the number of bursts
transmitted. A single scan comprises two sets of a predetermined number of
bursts first in one direction and then in the other. "Ultrasound gas-flow meter for household application", Sensors and
Actuators A37-38, 1993, pages 135-140 discloses a gas meter which utilises an
intermittent ultrasonic method for measuring flow therethrough. The method
comprises making direct time-of-flight measurements, and the propagation
times of the ultrasound pulses transmitted both upstream and downstream are
determined. The flow channel provides a 'W' path between the two transducers
which reduces the volume required.It is an object of the present invention therefore to provide a gas meter
which affords accurate gas measurement, reliable low maintenance operation, a
digital display which serves for indicating the volume of gas used and/or for
displaying data appertaining to operation of the meter, and data input/output
interface means by means of which data can be fed to or from the meter.It is further
