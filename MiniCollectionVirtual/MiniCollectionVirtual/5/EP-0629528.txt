<ABSTRACT>
A supplemental inflatable restraint assembly 
20 includes a canister 24 and a gas generator 22 to 

inflate an air bag 30 for deployment into the passenger 
compartment of a motor vehicle. Access to the 

assembly 20 is closed by a door 10 in an interior trim 
product 16, which door is held down by a cable release 

mechanism 36 that will separate from the door 10 as the 
door 10 is opened during supplemental inflatable 

restraint deployment.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to inflatable
restraint systems for use in motor vehicles and more
particularly to supplemental inflatable restraint
systems which are housed behind an interior trim
product of the vehicle beyond an opening which is
closed by a door that opens when a gas bag is inflated.Inflatable restraint systems for vehicles
require a cover which opens to provide a path for
deployment of a gas bag into the passenger compartment
as it is inflated.Some of the prior art pads or covers for air
bag devices are not soft and do not match or conform to
the styling and aesthetic requirements of an associated
interior trim product in which the supplemental
inflatable restraint system is housed. Such covers
are often formed from injection molded thermoplastic
elastomers or thermoplastic olefins. 
While such materials are suitable for mid-mount
locations such as on the front vertical surface of
an instrument panel, they do not perform well if
subjected to radiant heating, e.g., sunlight
directed through a front windshield of a vehicle.Other prior art pads or covers include a
foamed interior which provides a soft feel and an
outer skin of cast plastisol, e.g., polyvinyl
chloride (PVC) or urethane skin, ABS/PVC/nitrile
tripolymer vacuum formable sheet, dry cast polymer
skins, or injection molded PVC, which can be
aesthetically matched to the material of the outer
surface of an interior product which houses the
supplemental inflatable restraint system.Examples of such prior art pads or covers
are shown in United States Patent No. 3,708,179
which discloses mid-mounted doors formed of a layer
of urethane foam and an outer cover of a plastisol
skin material. The '179 structure is supported on
a pair of spaced hinge pins for movement outwardly
of the front vertical face of an instrument panel
so as to permit deployment of an air bag into the
passenger compartment at the passenger side of the
front seat. United States Patent Nos. 4,946,653 and
4,893,833 disclose door configurations for closing
an upper mount configured supplemental inflatable
restraint system wherein the door is located in an
upper surface of an instrument panel and moved
upwardly toward the windshield of the vehicle when
the air bag is deployed.One problem with such prior art systems
has been how to hold down the rear edge (from the
in car position) of the door adjacent the rear edge
of the deployment opening in the interior trim
product. In the case of top doors, the rear edge
is located at a point where children can pry the
door open unless it
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An inflatable restraint deployment system,
comprising a hold-down mechanism (36;90) for fastening a

door (10;64) of the deployment system in a tamper-proof
closed position, said hold-down mechanism (36;90)

comprising a first member (40;116) on said door (10;64) and
a second member (46;122) for mounting on a fixed support

(82) of an interior trim product (16), said hold-down
mechanism (36;90) including an elongate tie (44,52;136)

which extends from the first member (40;116) to the second
member (46;122) and is connected at one end to the first

member (40;116) and at the opposite end to the second
member (46;122), the tension being settable to set the

hold-down force on the door (10;64), wherein during
deployment of said inflatable restraint (30), said first

member (40;116) pulls free from said elongate tie
(44,52;136) and said elongate tie (44,52;136) is not

fractured and wherein said elongate tie (44,52;136) is
responsive to deployment of said inflatable restraint (30)

to fall and remain within the confines of said interior
trim product (16) following opening of the door (10) in

response to deployment of the gas bag (30).
A system according to claim 1, wherein said
elongate tie (44,52) is externally screwthreaded at said

opposite end and a nut (56) is engageable with the
screwthreading for tensioning the elongate tie (44,52).
A system according to claim 1, wherein said
elongate tie (136) has a plurality of axially spaced

annular segments (138) therealong selectively engageable
with said fixed support (82) for providing an adjustable

hold-down force on said door (10;64).
A system according to any preceding claim,
wherein said first member (40;116) has a mounting hole

(38;108) therein and said elongate tie (44,52;136) has an
anchor (50,134) thereon to fit in said mounting ho
le
(38;108) and to release from said hole (38;108) during

deployment of said inflatable restraint (30).
A system according to claim 4, wherein said
anchor (50;134) is a head (50;134) which increases in 

diameter progressing axially outwardly of said elongate
tie (44,52;136).
A system according to claim 5, wherein said
head (50;134) is frusto-conical.
A system according to claim 4, 5, or 6, wherein
said mounting hole (38;108) has a large diameter segment

(38a;130), and an elongate segment (38b;132) of a width
less than the diameter of said large diameter segment

(38a;130), said anchor (50;134) is insertable through said
large diameter segment (38a;130) and movable relative

thereto into interlocked relationship with said elongate
segment (38b;132), and said anchor (50;134) is

responsive to release of said inflatable restraint (30)
against the inner surface (40b;70a) of said door (10;64) to

deform said first member (40;70,98) so as to move out of
interlocked relationship with said elongate segment

(38b;132) for allowing said door (10;64) to be disengaged
from said elongate tie (44,52;136) and turned upwardly.
A system according to claim 7, wherein said
first member (70,98) comprises an L-shaped bracket (98) and

said mounting hole (108) is formed in one leg (106) of
said L-shaped bracket (98).
A system according to claim 7 or 8, wherein
said elongate segment (132) of said mounting hole (108) is

directed laterally of the door (64).
