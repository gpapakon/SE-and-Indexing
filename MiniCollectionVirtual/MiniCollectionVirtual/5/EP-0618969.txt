<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to the fields
of immunology and genetic engineering.The following information is provided for the
purpose of making known information believed by the
applicants to be of possible relevance to the present
invention. No admission is necessarily intended, nor
should be construed, that any of the following
information constitutes prior art against the present
invention.Antibodies are specific immunoglobulin (Ig)
polypeptides produced by the vertebrate immune system in
response to challenges by foreign proteins,
glycoproteins, cells, or other antigenic foreign
substances. The binding specificity of such
polypeptides to a particular antigen is highly refined,
with each antibody being almost exclusively directed to
the particular antigen which elicited it.Two major methods of generating vertebrate
antibodies are presently utilized:generation in situ by
the mammalian B lymphocytes and generation in cell
culture by B-cell hybrids. Antibodies are generated insitu as a result of the differentiation of immature B
lymphocytes into plasma cells (see Gough (1981), Trends
in Biochem Sci, 6:203 (1981). Even when only a single
antigen is introduced into the immune system for a
particular mammal, a uniform population of antibodies
does not result, i.e., the response is polyclonal.The limited but inherent heterogeneity of
polyclonal antibodies is overcome by the use of
hybridoma technology to create "monoclonal" antibodies
in cell cultures by B cell hybridomas (see Kohler and
Milstein (1975), Nature, 256:495-497). In this process,
a mammal is injected with an antigen, and its relatively
short-lived, or mortal, splenocytes or lymphocytes are
fused with an immortal tumor cell line. The fusion
produces hybrid cells or "hybridomas" which are both
immortal and capable of producing the genetically-coded
antibody of the B cell.In many applications, the use of monoclonal
antibodies produced in non-human animals is severely
restricted where the monoclonal antibodies are to be
used in humans. Repeated injections in humans of a
"foreign" antibody, such as a mouse antibody, may lead
to harmful hypersensitivity reactions, i.e., an anti-idiotypic,
or human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA)
response, (see Shawler et al. (1985), Journal of
Immunology, 135:1530-1535. and Sear et al., J. Biol. Resp.
Modifiers, 3:138-150).Various attempts have already been made to
manufacture human-derived monoclonal antibodies by using
human hybridomas (see Olsson et al., Proc. Natl. Acad.
Sci. U.S.A., 77:5429 (1980) and Roder et
