<ABSTRACT>
A power assisted steering system, in particular for motor vehicles, has a servo-motor (2), a servo-pump (3), a container (4), a control valve (1) with a controllable feedback device (5) and a control member (46) with a throttle cross-section which can be varied depending on the speed of the vehicle. The control valve (1) is designed as a four-way slide-valve and has an inlet connection (22, 23), a return connection (7) and two working connections (8, 10) for the lines (11, 12) that lead to both working chambers of the servo-motor (2). Between the feedback device (5) and the inlet connection (22, 23) is arranged a device (13) for stemming the flow of hydraulic medium, which in one embodiment is designed as a throttle (50, 51). This throttle (50, 51) allows a hydraulic centering component to be obtained besides a mechanical centering component.

Power steering system, in particular for motor vehicles, 
having a servomotor (2), a power-steering pump (3), a 

container (4), a control valve (1), having a controllable 
reaction device (5) and a control element (46), the 

throttle cross section of which is variable in dependence 
upon the vehicle speed, the control valve (1) taking the 

form of a four-way valve, having a supply connection (6; 
22, 23), which is hydraulically connected to the reaction 

device (5), a return connection (7) and two operating 
connections (8, 10) for lines (11, 12) leading to two 

operating chambers of the servomotor (2), characterized 
in that at least one device (13) for banking the pressure 

medium flow is disposed between the reaction device (5) 
and the supply connection (6; 22, 23). 
Power steering system according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the device (13) for banking the pressure medium 

flow is formed by a throttle (50, 51). 
Power steering system according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the device (13) for banking the pressure medium 

flow is formed by a spring-loaded retaining valve (52, 
53). 
Power steering system according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the device (13) for banking the pressure medium 

flow is formed by a flow-limiting valve (57), which 
simultaneously serves as a flow-limiting valve for the 

power steering system. 
Power steering system according to claim 4, characterized 
in that the flow-limiting valve (57) is integrated into 

the power-steering pump (3). 
Power steering system according to claim 5, characterized 
in that the control element (46) is integrated into the 

power-steering pump (3).  
 
Power steering system according to claim 6, characterized 
in that a cut-off valve (58) is disposed upstream of the 

control element (46).
