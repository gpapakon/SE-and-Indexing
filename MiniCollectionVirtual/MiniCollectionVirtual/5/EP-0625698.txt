<ABSTRACT>
A sensor for generating a signal for vibration/impact 
detection or measurement is provided which has fewer components 

parts and is simple in construction and durable, which is less 
expensive. A moving magnet (2) is housed in a moving magnet guide 

member (3) held in a fixed state relative to fixed magnets (1) 
so that the moving magnet (2) is positioned between the fixed 

magnets (1) in such a manner that respective poles of same 
polarity of the fixed and moving magnets (1, 2) are positioned 

in face to face relation. Means (4₁ to 4₈) for detecting displacement 
of the moving magnet (2), such as Hall element (4₂) is 

disposed at a position opposite to a side of the moving magnet 
guide member (3) which is held in flotation at a magnetically 

balanced position under a magnetic repulsion force due to 
homopolarity, so that a signal for vibration/impact detection or 

measurement may be obtained on the basis of a signal from the 
detecting means (4₁ to 4₈).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sensor for 
producing a signal for vibration/impact detection and/or 
measurement. Hitherto, there have been known sensors for 
detecting or measuring vibration and/or impact of the type 
having a specific type of weight and a spring which are 
typically such that the stress of the spring is utilized in 
obtaining a signal for detecting and/or measuring the 
magnitude of the vibration and/or impact in terms of 
changes in the elasticity of the spring. For example, 
pedometers are known including one such that a spring-biased 
rocking magnet is used to detect a change in the 
magnetic field, and another such that a spindle suspended 
from an arm end is used to provide a signal indicative of 
contact making and breaking due to spindle rocking. 
Sensors which provide such a signal upon detection of 
acceleration have also been used in some areas of 
application. Sensors of the former type structurally require 
springs, and this necessitates, in addition to springs,  
 
many other component parts, such as weight and hinge 
mechanism. In effect, therefore, it is difficult to 
achieve good quality stability and cost reduction and there 
is a limitation in respect of service durability. Sensors 
of the type which detects acceleration for vibration 
sensing or measurement have a disadvantage that they 
involve high costs. The present invention has been developed in view 
of these facts and, accordingly, it is an object of the 
invention to provide a sensor which is structurally simple 
and durable and inexpensive to manufacture. In order to accomplish the above object, 
according to one technical aspect of the present invention 
there is provided a sensor for detecting or measuring 
vibration and/or impact, comprising, at least, a fixed 
magnet having magnetic poles oriented in vertical 
directions, a moving magnet disposed above the fixed magnet 
and in face-to-face relation with the upper side magnetic 
pole of the fixed magnet on its homopolarity side so that 
it is positioned in flotation with a predetermined distance 
kept from the fixed magnet under a repulsion force due to 
homopolarity, a moving magnet guide member for guiding the 
moving magnet perpendicularly movably relative to the fixed 
magnet, the guide member being in a fixed condition with  
 
respect to the fixed magnet, and a moving magnet 
displacement sensing means attached to the guide member for 
detecting the displacement of the moving magnet. According to another technical aspect of the 
present
