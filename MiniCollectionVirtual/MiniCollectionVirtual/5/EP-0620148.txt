<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a structure (14) for the loading surface (10) of a vehicle, with at least one pair of guide rails (22), which is provided approximately horizontally on side walls (12) at a medium distance (H1) from the loading surface (10) and to which there can be connected end-side connecting elements of a support tube or similar support profile (20), which runs between them in the operating position. At a distance from one guide rail (22) the support profile (20) is connected by a joint (44) to a rope-like link (42) and the link (42) is connected at the other end to the guide rail (22) by means of a further joint (47), it being possible to fold the support profile about its joint (44) and the link (42) about the further link (47) into their rest positions. The latter is to be secured on a profile of C-shaped cross-section, which at least partially surrounds the guide rail (22) and is provided in a manner which allows it to be fixed thereon.

Body structure for the loading surface of a vehicle with at least one pair of guide
rails provided approximately horizontally on side walls at a distance from the

loading surface and to which end connecting members of a supporting element
extending between them in the operating position can be connected, the length of

the supporting element movable relative to the guide rails corresponding
approximately to the distance between the two guide rails, characterised in that the

supporting element in the form of a supporting tube or supporting profile (20, 34,
52) is connected at a distance (n) from one profile end (48) to at least one strand-like

link (42, 42a) by means of a joint (43, 44) and the link is supported at the
other end by means of another joint (46, 47) on one guide rail (22), the supporting

profile (20, 34, 52) being pivotable about its joint (44) and the link (42, 42a) about
the other joint (46, 47) from the operating position into a rest position and being

displaceable on the guide rail.
Body structure according to claim 1, characterised in that the other joint (46, 47)
is secured to a profile (48) partially embracing the guide rail (22) and provided

fixably thereon.
Body structure according to claim 1 or claim 2, characterised in that the
supporting profile (34) in the form of a supporting tube forms a supporting beam

(20) together with at least one supporting tube connected in parallel therewith and
the strand-like link in the form of tube section (42) extends between the two

supporting tubes.
Body structure according to claim 1 or claim 2, characterised in that the
supporting profile (52) is a box profile with a laterally projecting top flange (54)

on to the profile side walls (53) of which respective strand-like links (42a) are
hinged.
Body structure according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that a transverse
bolt (44) projects from the end of the link (42a) or the tube section (42) remote 

from the guide rail (22) and is guided as a joint axis in an axial elongated hole
(43) in the supporting profile (20, 34, 52), or that an elongated hole (43) for a

transverse bolt (44) of the supporting profile (52) or the supporting tube/s (34) is
provided on the end of the link (42a) or the tube section (42) remote from the

guide rail (22).
Body structure according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the
supporting profile (52) or the supporting tubes (34) is/are provided at its/their

end/s with at least one hook profile (28, 28r) as a connecting member which can
be fixedly inserted into an upwardly directed longitudinal groove (25) in the other

guide rail (22) and is provided on at least one telescopic pin (30) of the supporting
profile (52) or the supporting tube/s (34).
Body structure according to claim 6, characterised in that the telescopic pin (30) is
displaceably supported in the box space (58) of the supporting profile (52), in

particular displaceably connected to the supporting profile (52) or the supporting
tube/s by a pair consisting of the elongated hole (38, 38a) and the transverse pin

(40).
Body structure according to one of claims 2 to 7, characterised in that the guide
rail (22) has two longitudinal grooves (25) extending in opposite directions in

cross section and the profile (48) of the link (42a) or the tube section (42)
provided with the joint (46, 47) engages therein with a C-shaped cross section.
Body structure according to one of claims 6 to 8, characterised in that an axially
movable bolt (32) or a tiltable fixing hook (60, 61) is provided on the hook profile

(28) of the telescopic pin (30) and/or the C-shaped profile (48) of the tube section
(42) or link (42a) and its free end can be inserted into a bore (24) in the guide rail

(22).
Body structure according to claim 9, characterised in that the fixing hook (60, 61)
or the bolt (32) on the C-shaped profile (48) of the tube section (42) or link (42a)

traverses the latter as a locking bolt and the C-shaped profile is preferably flanked
on both sides by hook profiles (28r). 
Body structure according to claim 10, characterised in that the locking bolt (32,
60, 61) on the tube section (42) or l
ink (42a) is pressed into the bore (24) in the
guide rail (22) by an energy accumulator (31, 62).
Body structure according to one of claims 1 to 11, characterised in that the tube
section (42) or the link (42a) can be pivoted through 180Â° from the operating

position between the supporting tubes (34) or towards the supporting profile (52)
into the rest position and its free end can be applied to the stop web (50) or the top

flange (54).
Body structure according to one of claims 3 to 12, characterised in that, in the
horizontal operating position, the tube section (42) is secured to the two joint axes

(44, 47) and at least one stop web (50) embracing it between the supporting tubes
(34) parallel thereto.
Body structure according to claim 12 or claim 13, characterised in that the stop
web (50) is provided outside a swivelling circle (K) of the free end of the tube

section (42) about the transverse bolt (44) and the latter is supported at the end of
the elongated hole (43) of the tube section close to the stop web.
Body structure according to one of claims 12 to 14, characterised in that, in the
rest position of the tube section (42), the transverse bolt (44) is supported at the

end of the elongated hole (43) of the tube section remote from the stop web (50).
