<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magnetic
recording medium with excellent fungiresistance as well
as lubrication and durability and a process for
manufacturing such a magnetic recording medium.A magnetic recording medium is manufactured by
mixing and dispersing a magnetic powder, a lubricant
and a binder with each other to form a magnetic coating
material, and applying and drying the magnetic coating
material onto a non-magnetic substrate to form a
magnetic layer on the non-magnetic substrate. The binder
comprises a thermoplastic or thermosetting resin, for
example, synthetic resins such as vinyl chloride/vinyl
acetate-based copolymer resins, polyurethane resins,
cellulose derivatives, epoxy resins, polyvinyl butylals,
synthetic rubber-based resins, acrylic resins, polyester
resins, and the lubricant comprises, for example, an
aliphatic acid or aliphatic acid ester, or a surfactant.
These binder and lubricant may contain a compound which
is a nutrition for fungi to accelerate growth of fungi.On the other hand, magnetic recording media
have been used and stored in various temperature and
humidity environments as a result of a recent expansion
of market of magnetic recording media. Thus, magnetic
recording media are also used in a high humidity
environment and it is noticed that fungi grow on the
magnetic layer of the media during use or storage of
the media. The fungi on the media may disadvantageously
cause peeling of a magnetic layer, lowering of a
flatness of a medium, contamination of the surface of a
magnetic head, signal errors in a magnetic tape or disc,
and like.To prevent growth of fungi in magnetic
recording media, there is proposed to incorporate an 
anti-fungus agent in a magnetic layer, see for example,
U.S. Patent Nos. 4,698,280, and 5,028,497 and Japanese
Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 04-105215.Nevertheless, conventional magnetic recording
media do not have a sufficient resistance to fungi.The object of the present invention is to
provide a magnetic recording medium excellent in
fungiresistance and having a lubrication and durability,
without affecting the magnetic properties.The present invention, in order to attain the
above object, provides a magnetic recording medium
comprising a non-magnetic substrate and a magnetic
coating layer on the substrate, said magnetic coating
layer comprising a ferromagnetic powder, a binder, and
optionally an organic lubricant, said magnetic recording
medium further containing a first compound represented
by the following general formula (I)
