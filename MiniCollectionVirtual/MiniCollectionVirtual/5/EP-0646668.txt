<ABSTRACT>
The separating device contains carrier rails (13) for storing the healds in the form of a stack, a dividing-off member (18) for pushing the respective foremost heald (L1) laterally out of the stack into an intermediate position, and a first transfer means (19) for transporting the healds from the intermediate position in the direction of a heald carrier for the transport of the healds to their draw-in position. Provided in the region between the intermediate position and the heald carrier is a lock which contains a controlled clamp (38, 39) for the carrier rails (13) and which, in each case, is opened briefly for the transport of a separated heald (L1) to the heald carrier. Use for the separation of healds of all types, especially of those having closed end loops.

Heald-separating apparatus for warp-thread 
drawing-in machines, with carrier rails (13) for the 

storage of the healds (4) in the form of a stack, with a 

dividing-off member (18) for pushing the respective 
foremost heald laterally out of the stack into an intermediate 

position, and with a first transfer means 
(19, 43) for transporting the healds from the intermediate 

position in the direction of a heald carrier (37) 
for transporting the healds to their drawing-in position, 

characterized in that a lock having a first controlled 
clamp (38, 39) for holding the carrier rails (13) is 

provided in the region between the intermediate position 
and the heald carrier (37), and in that this lock is 

briefly opened respectively for transporting a separated 
heald (LI) to the heald carrier (37) by the transfer 

means (19, 43). 
Heald-separating apparatus according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the lock has a second controlled 

clamp (39) arranged at a distance from the first clamp 
(38), and in that the transport of the separated healds 

(LI) takes place in steps from the intermediate position 
up to the second clamp and from the latter up to the 

heald carrier (37), the second clamp being closed during 
the first transport step and the first clamp being closed 

during the second transport step. 
Heald-separating apparatus according to Claim 2, 
characterized by a second transfer means (43), the first 

transfer means (19) being provided for the first transport 
step from the intermediate position up to the second 

clamp (39) and the second transfer means being provided 
for the second transport step from the second clamp to 

the heald carrier (37). 
Heald-separating apparatus according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that each of the two controlled clamps 

(38, 39) has a clamping gripper consisting of two clamping 
jaws, and in that the two clamping jaws are actuated 

in order to open and close the clamps. 
Heald-separating apparatus according to Claim 4,  
 

characterized in that the clamping jaws are driven 
positively by a common drive (41, 42). 
Heald-separating apparatus according to Claim 5, 
characterized in that the drive has a pneumatically 

actuable slotted link (42) acting on the clamping jaws. 
Heald-separating apparatus according to Claim 6, 
characterized in that the clamping jaws are designed as 

two-armed levers and are mounted on pivot axes, and in 
that one end of the clamping jaws is provided for engagement 

with the carrier rail (13) and the other end is 
provided for engagement with the slotted link (42) of the 

drive. 
Heald-separating apparatus according to Claim 7, 
characterized in that a nose-like fixing member (40) 

provided for engaging into-a corresponding bore of the 
carrier rail (13) is arranged at the said one end of one 

of the clamping jaws of each clamp (38, 39). 
Heald-separating apparatus according to one of 
Claims 1 to 8, in which the first transfer means (19) is 

formed by a tappet having a stroke adjustable in the 
longitudinal direction (A) of the carrier rails (13), 

characterized in that the second transfer means (43) is 
likewise formed by a tappet having a stroke adjustable 

essentially in the longitudinal direction (A) of the 
carrier rails (13), and in that this tappet is arranged 

above or below the tappet forming the first transfer 
means. 
Heald-separating apparatus according to Claim 9, 
characterized in that the two tappets have separate 

drives and are controlled in such a way that the tappet 
(19) provided for the first transport step is not moved 

back into its initial position before the commencement of 
the second transport step.
