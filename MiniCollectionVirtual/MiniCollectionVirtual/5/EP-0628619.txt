<ABSTRACT>
Curable adhesive compositions comprise combinations 
of organosiloxane MQ resins and liquid polyorganosiloxanes of 

specified viscosity and functionality. The compositions are 
substantially free of unreactive materials and are applied in 

the molten state. Depending upon the concentration of 
reactive groups on the resin and polyorganosiloxane, the 

compositions may also include a silane containing an average 
of more than two hydrolyzable groups per molecule. Preferred 

compositions develop excellent adhesion to a variety of 
organic and metallic substrates during curing under ambient 

conditions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for bonding
substrates to one another wherein a specified class of
solventless moisture reactive organosiloxane compositions is
heated to a flowable state. These compositions are applied
to a first substrate as an adhesive layer, a second
substrate is then placed in contact with the adhesive layer
while the composition is heated to be reflowable and the
compositions are subsequently allowed to cure. The strength
of the bond between the substrates increases as the
composition gradually converts from a thermoplastic material
to a cured resin-reinforced elastomeric material that is not
reflowable when heated to temperatures well above the
application temperature.Many combinations of resinous, liquid organic and
organosilicon polymers are known. Some exhibit properties
that are characteristic of pressure sensitive adhesives
(PSA's). PSA's based on organosilicon compounds typically
contain: 1) a silicone resin with specified concentrations
of monofunctional R3SiO units, referred to as M units, and
tetrafunctional SiO4/2 units, referred to as Q units, and 2)
a high molecular weight polydiorganosiloxane having the
consistency of a gum. These compositions are typically
applied as a solution in a compatible organic liquid or a
low viscosity, liquid non-reactive polyorganosiloxane.
Following application of the solution to a desired substrate
the liquid is evaporated to deposit the PSA.The prior art is represented by EP-A2 0 529 841,
US-A 4,143,088, US-A 4,515,932, US-A 4,753,977, US-A 
4,990,364, US-A 5,070,121, US-A 5,091,484, JP-A 64/251827
and JP-A 4/81487.Whenever curable compositions are applied in the
molten state as adhesives to join two or more substrates to
form a composite structure, the cooled uncured compositions
should exhibit sufficient adhesion, referred to as "green
strength", to allow the structure to be transported or
otherwise manipulated without adversely affecting the
integrity of the bonded structure.With the increasing emphasis on eliminating or at
least reducing the amount of volatile materials released
during the application and curing of coating compositions,
there has been a growing demand for curable adhesive
compositions that can be applied in the absence of solvents
or diluents.It is therefore an object of the present invention
to provide moisture reactive adhesive compositions that are
substantially free of unreactive liquid materials and can be
heated for application as molten liquids that upon
contacting a substrate at ambient temperature
