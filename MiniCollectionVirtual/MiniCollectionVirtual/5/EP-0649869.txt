<ABSTRACT>
Elastomer-coated inorganic particles characterised in that they are in individualised form. The invention also relates to a process for the preparation of the said particles, this process being characterised in that it consists in:   a) reacting inorganic particles with at least one coupling agent containing at least one polyoxyethylene block and with at least one elastomer latex,   b) separating the liquid phase from the particles,   c) drying the particles.   The invention also relates to the use of the said particles for the reinforcement of thermoplastic polymers and to the thermoplastic polymers reinforced with the inorganic particles according to the invention.
