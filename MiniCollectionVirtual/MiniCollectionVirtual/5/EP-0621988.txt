<ABSTRACT>
Spark plugs, suitable in particular for internal combustion engines, are disclosed. The object of the invention is the attachment of highly erosion resistant spark insets (20/1) in at least one of the electrodes (20) that form the sparking distance. Such spark insets (20/1) are pin-shaped and are inserted with a longitudinal section (20/1') provided with raised parts (24) and/or depressions (25) into a frontal hole (23) of the electrode. In order to reliably secure these spark insets (20/1), the end section of the electrode (20) around the hole (23) is partially or totally deformed (by upsetting) in the radial direction. Ring-shaped grooves (20/1'), threads and axial and circumferential knurls may be provided to form said raised parts (24) or depressions (25). This reliable and economic manner of attaching spark plugs (20/1) to electrodes (20) requires no application of heat.
