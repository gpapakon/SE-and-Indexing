<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a bidirectional 
control rectifying semiconductor apparatus and, more 
particularly, to a bidirectional control rectifying 
semiconductor apparatus having a high gate sensitivity 
capable of driving an element by a small current. Fig. 1 shows a sectional view showing a TRIAC which 
is one type of bidirectional control rectifying semiconductor 
apparatus. That is, an eighth conductive layer 8 
as a p⁺-type conductive layer is formed on the lower and 
side surfaces of a first conductive layer 1 serving as 
an n⁻-type substrate by a known technique. A ninth conductive 
layer 9 as an n⁺-type conductive layer is formed 
in the lower surface region of the eighth conductive 
layer 8. A second electrode 13 is arranged on the lower 
surface of the eighth conductive layer 8 and a terminal 
of the second electrode 13 is represented by T₂. As 
shown in Fig. 1, three p⁺-type conductive layers, i.e., 
second, third, and forth conductive layers 2, 3, and 4, 
are formed in the surface region of the first conductive 
layer 1. N⁺-type conductive layers, i.e., fifth, sixth, 
and seventh conductive layers 5, 6, and 7, are formed in 
the surface regions of the conductive layers 2, 3, and 
4, respectively. A first electrode 10 is arranged on 
the surfaces of the fifth conductive layer 5 and the 
second conductive layer 2, and a terminal of the first 
electrode 10 is represented by T₁. The second and  
 
third conductive layers 2 and 3 and the second and seventh 
conductive layers 2 and 7 are connected through Aℓ 
wiring layers, respectively. First and second gate 
electrodes 11 and 12 are arranged on the sixth and 
fourth conductive layers 6 and 4, respectively. 
Terminals of the first and second gate electrodes 11 and 
12 are represented by G₁ and G₂, respectively. The terminals 
G₁ and G₂ of the first and second gate electrodes 
11 and 12 are connected to each other through an Aℓ wiring 
layer to obtain a common terminal G. First, an operation principle of the conventional 
TRIAC will be described. There are four modes I, II, 
III, and IV for turning on the TRIAC having such an 
arrangement. In the mode I (T₂+, G+), the TRIAC performs 
the same operation as in a conventional amplifying 
gate thyristor. In the mode II (T₂+, G-), the terminal 
G₁ section of the first gate electrode 11 performs a 
negative bias junction thyristor operation. In the mode 
III (T₂-, G-), the terminal G₁ section of the first gate 
electrode 11 performs a remote gate operation. In the 
mode IV (T₂-, G+), the
