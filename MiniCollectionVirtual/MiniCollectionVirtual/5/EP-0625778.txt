<DESCRIPTION>
United States Patent No. 4,971,932 (Alpha et al.) 
describes the fabrication of memory storage devices consisting 
essentially of a head pad and a rigid information 
disk, which disk consists essentially of a rigid substrate 
having a coating of magnetic media on the surface thereof 
facing the head pad. That patent is particularly directed 
to materials for use as the substrate for the disk. Two 
different groups of glass-ceramics are disclosed: glass-ceramics 
containing a sheet silicate as the predominant 
crystal phase and glass-ceramics containing a chain 
silicate as the predominant crystal phase. The patent 
observed that the substrate ought to exhibit the following 
three properties: 
(a) a surface highly resistant to scratches to 
withstand frequent takeoffs and landings; (b) high strength and be sufficiently rigid to allow 
the production of very thin disks (< 1 mm thickness) which 
are dimensionally stable during speeds of rotation up to 
7200 rpm; and (c) a surface having a slight uniform texture, i.e., 
an average roughness of about 1-6 nm, in order to provide a 
suitably low coefficient of "stiction", which is a measure 
of the interaction between a head and a disk leading to 
enhanced magnetics and lower flying height. As was stated in the patent, the claimed glass-ceramics 
exhibited very high body strengths and fracture  
 
toughnesses. That combination of properties enabled the 
manufacture of very thin, rigid disks of about 0.5-0.6 mm 
thickness, a much harder surface than aluminum metal (Knoop 
hardness >500 compared with <100 for aluminum). The 
inherently textured surface of the glass-ceramics can be 
of special value because no texturizing operation may be 
required, either chemical or mechanical, to bring the 
surface in condition for application of the magnetic 
medium. The surface texture of the glass-ceramic surfaces 
can be tailored to a particular average roughness value 
through minor adjustments in base composition or through 
standard grinding and polishing or chemical etching. The continued rapid development of software has fueled 
demand for more magnetic rigid disk memory, i.e., increased 
capacity per disk. As a result, the requirements for the 
media substrate are changing rapidly. Higher areal 
density, i.e., increased bit and track density, results in 
smaller bit cell size. Therefore, in order to read and 
write data, the recording heads must fly closer to the 
surface of the disk. As a consequence, the characteristics 
of the substrate become even more critical

A substrate for a rigid information disk for use in a 
magnetic storage device comprising a head pad and a rigid 

information disk, said substrate having a circular orifice 
in the center thereof, at least one surface of said 

substrate having a first circular region surrounding said 
orifice and a second circular region surrounding said first 

circular region, the surface of said first circular region

smooth surface area of said second circular region and 
being the landing zone for the head pad, the second 

circular region comprising the data containing region. 
A substrate according to claim 1 wherein said first

(2) heat treating at least said exposed area at a 
temperature between the annealing point and the softening 

point of the glass for a sufficient period of time to cause 
the generation of nuclei in the glass followed by the

low friction area; 
(3) contacting at least the crystallized area of said
