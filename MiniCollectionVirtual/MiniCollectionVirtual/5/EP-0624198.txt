<ABSTRACT>
Synthetic peptides have an amino acids sequence corresponding to at least one antigenic determinant of at least one protein, usually a structural protein, particularly the E1, E2 or C proteins, of rubella virus (RV), are used as is, in hybrid or chimeric tandem T-B form, in lipidated form, linked to a carrier molecule and/or polymerized to form molecular aggregates, in vaccines against rubella. Analogs of peptides which are human T-cell determinants are used to treat rubella-associated autoimmune disorders.

<DESCRIPTION>
 SYNTHETIC PEPTIDES FOR A RUBELLA VACCINEFIELD OF INVENTION The present invention relates to the development of synthetic vaccines against rubella viral infection. Particularly, the invention is related to the use of human T-helper determinants (THDs) and B-cell viral neutralization epitopes (BEs) from the rubella virus structural proteins El, E2 and C, and their combination with other synthetic lipopeptides containing cytotoxic T- lymphocytes (CTL) epitopes to produce novel synthetic vaccine candidates, which can elicit neutralizing antibodies and a cell-mediated immune response against rubella virus.BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION Rubella (German measles) is usually a benign childhood infection, but rubella virus (RV) can cause a persistent infection of the brain called progressive rubella panencephalitis (ref. 40,51 - the literature references are listed at the end of the specification) . RV has been isolated from synovial cells of some patients with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (ref. 8,13). Several live attenuated rubella vaccines have been introduced since 1969 (ref. 2,41). Immunization of infants and susceptible women of child-bearing age against rubella virus is now a standard public health measure. However, there are serious medical concerns with the use of live attenuated rubella virus vaccine for routine immunization. These concerns include the risk of congenital infection of the fetus resulting in diabetis- related diseases (ref. 44) and rubella-associated arthritis following rubella vaccination (ref. 8,47), as well as the possibility of re-infection of vaccinees by wild-type RV due to antigenic differences between wild- type and vaccine virus strains (ref. 11,21). In addition to these problems, rubella virus grows to a relatively 

 low titer in tissue cultures and its structural proteins are difficult to purify (ref. 27) . Therefore, there is a clear requirement for preparing a non-infectious rubella vaccine by alternative means, such as recombinant DNA technology and peptides synthesis. Research efforts have recently focused on characterizing both the viral genome and the host immune responses.RV is the sole member of the genus Rubivirus in the Togavirus family (ref. 29) . The primary sequences of the rubella virus structural proteins decoded from cDNA clones have been reported (ref. 10). The RV virion contains an RNA genome enclosed within an icosahedral capsid composed of multiple copies of a basic capsid protein C of 33 kDa (ref. 38) . Surrounding this nucleocapsid is a lipid bilayer in
