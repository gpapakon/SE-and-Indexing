<ABSTRACT>
In a Class B integrated circuit amplifier having a 
complementary symmetry emitter follower-type output stage, an NPN 

transistor (Q5) is connected effectively in parallel with the PNP output 
transistor (Q4) and is arranged to draw a current dependent upon the 

current flowing in the emitter-collector path of the PNP transistor (Q4), 
to compensate for the relatively poor characteristics of the PNP 

transistor (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to integrated circuit 
amplifiers. In particular although not exclusively the invention is 
concerned with a power efficient output drive circuit suitable for 
prescalers fabricated on high speed bipolar silicon processes. The 
technique is also suitable for other types of circuits incorporating 
ECL type output drives. Prescalers normally have a standard ECL type output drive. 
This consists of an emitter follower transistor biased with a 
constant pull down current provided by a current source or an 
external resistor. This results in a class A type output drive 
stage. Many high speed bipolar processes support good NPN 
transistors, but have relatively poor lateral PNPs. These PNP 
transistors operate in the lateral plane resulting in moderate Ft 
and poor current handling capability. The output driver proposed uses a class B output drive 
stage, utilising a complementary PNP active pull down circuit. 
This results in an energy efficient output drive circuit. This circuit is suitable for low voltage (2.7 volt) 
prescalers and has the added advantage of being able to be powered 
down when required for battery economy purposes. According to the present invention an integrated circuit 
amplifier comprises an NPN junction transistor and a PNP junction 
transistor having their respective emitter-collector paths connected  
 
between an output terminal and positive and negative supply lines 
respectively and means to supply input signals to their respective 
base electrodes, and a further NPN junction transistor having its 
collector-emitter path connected effectively in parallel with the 
emitter-collector path of said PNP junction transistor and arranged 
to draw a current dependent upon the current flowing through the 
emitter-collector path of said PNP transistor. Preferably the base-emitter path of said further NPN 
junction transistor is connected in parallel with a collector load 
resistor for said PNP junction transistor. Amplifiers in accordance with the present invention will 
now be described by way of example with reference to the 
accompanying drawings, of which Figures 1 to 3 show diagrammatically 
three different embodiments. The basic circuit principles are described with reference 
to Figure 1. From this circuit it can be seen that Q3 and Q4 with 
Q5 provide a low impedance emitter follower output drive 
arrangement. These transistors are biased for a low quiescent 
current by means of matched transistors Q1 and Q2, the Vbe's of Q1 
and Q2 being dependent on
