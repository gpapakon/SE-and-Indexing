<ABSTRACT>
There is described a remote control system for electrical 
appliances, comprising a control transmitter capable of emitting a 

plurality of differing control signals, and a number of control 
receivers wherein each control receiver can discriminate between the 

control signals and responds only to one of the control signals. In 
a preferred control receiver, a sensing device (1) provides a first 

output signal dependant on a control signal incident on the sensing 
device, the first output signal is fed to a plurality of band-pass 

filters (4,5) each of which is arranged to provide a second output 
signal when the first output signal has a signal parameter within a 

respective predetermined range, the second output signal from one of 
the band-pass filters (4,5) is selected in a selector device (6) and 

the selected second output signal is compared with a reference signal 
in a comparator device (8), and a third output signal generated by 

the comparator device (8) in dependance on the relative values of the 
second output signal and the reference signal is applied to an 

integrated circuit current control element (9,11).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to electrical installations, 
and is particularly concerned with remotely-controlled switching of 
electrical loads. Dimmer switches for domestic lighting installations are well 
known, and are conventionally controlled either by potentiometers or 
by touch plate sensors wherein an integrated circuit controls the 
current supplied to the lighting apparatus in response to input 
signals from a capacitive touch plate. It is also known, for example 
from UK Patent 2,230,367, to control electrical loads by means of 
remote control transmitters using radio, infra-red, ultrasonic or 
microwave transmission methods. A disadvantage of some conventional infra-red controlled 
lighting switches is that the usual wiring installation available at 
the switch location does not include a separate neutral line, and 
thus a conventional digital encoding device may not be used due to 
the difficulty in providing a suitably strong and stable power supply 
from the available wiring. Proprietary encoding devices generally 
include preamplifiers which require substantial current, and the 
signal to noise ratio is such as to render the coded signals 
indecipherable. The present invention seeks to provide an infra-red control 
system for incandescent lighting or other electrical appliances 
having low power resistive loads, particularly in a domestic 
environment, wherein the control transmitter will emit a plurality of 
differing control signals, and wherein each control receiver can 
discriminate between such control signals and can respond only to a 
particular one of the control signals. It is also an object of the present invention to provide an 
infra-red lighting switch of compact size which may be installed in a 
conventionally-wired lighting switch location without the need for 
the provision of additional wiring, particularly avoiding the need 
for a separate neutral line.  A further object of the present invention is to provide a 
control circuit for an infra-red lighting control switch which avoids 
the use of metallic screening in the receiving circuitry, thus 
reducing cost in materials and manufacture. A further objective of 
the present invention is to provide a controller for interior or 
exterior lighting, or for any other electrical load, which operates 
using a limited power supply having high noise content and avoids 
cross-talk between channels without the use of expensive screening. According to a first aspect of the present invention, there 
is provided an infra-red remote
