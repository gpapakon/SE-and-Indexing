<ABSTRACT>
1.2. The invention relates to a machine for washing tiled surfaces, having a rotating cleaning band made of synthetic sponge, felt or another sponge-like, liquid-absorbing material, which can be brought into contact with the surface to be washed and in so doing picks up the dirt present on this surface and conveys it to a dirt-discharging device which plunges into a container containing a liquid, in particular a cleaning liquid. The cleaning band is arranged on the outer circumference (10) of a roller (2) which rolls on the surface (11) to be cleaned, and is in contact with a rotating liquid-conveying band (4) which plunges into the container (6) holding the cleaning liquid (13) and at the contact point transfers liquid onto the cleaning band (1), so that the dirt taken up by the cleaning band is flushed out and runs off into the liquid container. A press-roller (3) downstream of this contact point (9) squeezes remaining liquid and dirt out of the cleaning band before the latter comes into contact again with the surface (11) to be cleaned during the rolling of the roller (2).

Machine for washing tiled surfaces, comprising a rotating cleaning ribbon (1) of 
synthetic sponge, felt or another spong-like, liquid collecting material which is located on 

the circumference (10) of a roll (2) rolling on a surface (11) to be cleaned picking up the 
dirt on that surface during rolling and further comprising a squeezing roll (3) pressing 

itself against the cleaning band (1), 
characterized in that
 the cleaning band (1) is in 
contact with a rotating liquid transport band (4) for delivering the dirt, which transport 

band is immersed in a container (6) receiving a liquid (13), especially a cleaning liquid, 
with the squeezing roll (3) being located in the direction of rotation A of the roll (2) 

behind the point (9) of contact of the liquid transport band (4) with the surface (12) of 
the cleaning band (1), and that the liquid container (6), the liquid transport band (4) and 

the cleaning band (1) form together with the rolls (2, 7, 8) receiving these bands as well 
as with the squeezing roll (3) a unit which can be driven over the surface (11) to be 

cleaned. 
Machine according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the direction of rotation A of the 
cleaning band 1 before the point of contact (9) of the liquid transport band (4) with the 

surface (12) of the cleaning band there is a dirty liquid dispensing plate (5) extending 
over the width of the liquid transport band or cleaning band entering into the cleaning 

liquid container (6). 
Machine according to claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that
 the dirty liquid 
dispensing plate (5) is located directly below the point of contact (9) of the liquid 

transport band (4) with the cleaning band (1).  
 
Machine according to one of the claims 1 - 3, 
characterized in that
 the liquid 
transport band (4) is tensioned over two turn-around rolls (7, 8), the one (7) of which is 

located within the cleaning liquid container (6) and the other one (8) at the point of 
contact (9) of the liquid transport band (4) with the cleaning band (1) so that the liquid 

transport band conveys the liquid from the container (6) to above transmitting it in the 
area of the upper turn-around roll (8) to the cleaning band (1), wherein the upper turm-around 

roll (8) is pressed into the surface (12) of the cleaning band (1). 
Machine according to one of the claims 1 - 4, 
characterized in that
 the surface (14) 
of the squeezing roll (3) is provided with spiral formed grooves which feed the liquid 

transmitted from the liquid transport band (4) to the surface (12) of the cleaning band (1) 
and removed from the liquid container from the edges of the cleaning band in the 

direction to the centre of the cleaning band squeezing it out together with the dirt 
remained in the cleaning band and moving them on to the upper run (15) of the liquid 

transport band (4) returning into the liquid container (6). 
Machine according to one of the claims 1 - 5, 
characterized in that
 the width of the 
squeezing roll (3) corresponds to the width of the cleaning band (1). 
Machine according to one of the claims 1 - 6, 
characterized in that
 the pressure of 
the squeezing roll (3) is adjustable. 
Machine according to one of the claims 1 - 7, 
characterized in that
 the cleaning band 
(1) consists of spong-like material intensively taking over the cleaning liquid as well as 

the dirty particles. 
Machine according to one of the claims 1 - 8, 
characterized in that
 the liquid 
transport band (4) is provided with a surface structure storing the cleaning liquid (13). 
Machine according to one of the claims 1 - 9, 
characterized in that
 the angle of 
inclination of the liquid transport band (4) with respect to the surface (12) of the cleaning 

band (1) or the surface (11) to be cleaned is adjustable. 
Machine according to one of the claims 1 - 10, 
characterized in that
 at least one of 
the rolls (2, 7, 8) can be driven by an engine.  

 
Machine according to one of the claims 1 - 11, 
characterized in that
 the running 
speed of the liquid transport band (4) corresponds to the running speed of the roll (2) or 

the cleaning band (1), respectively. 
Machine according to one of the claims 1 - 12, 
characterized in that
 the running 
speed of the liquid transport band (4) is greater than the running speed of the roll (2) or 

the cleaning band (1), respectively. 
Machine according to one of the claims 1 - 13, 
characterized in that
 the liquid 
transport band (4) is pressed at the point of contact (9) against the surface (12) of the 

cleaning band (1). 
Machine according to one of the claims 1 - 14, characterized in that the speed of 
rotation of at least one of the rolls (2, 7, 8) is adjustable.
