<ABSTRACT>
A particle transfer film (10) has a substrate 
(12) having coated thereon an exterior layer (14) of 

polyurethane. The polyurethane is copolymerized with a 
charge control agent of the formula 


where R¹ represents: 

 
   R² represents sulfonate, oxyphenylene sulfonate, 
oxycyclohexylene sulfonate or p-toluenesulfonamidosulfonyl;

 
   x and y are integers which together are of 

sufficient value to achieve an R¹ molecular weight 
of 300 to 30,000; and

 
   M represents hydrogen, an alkali metal, ammonium or 

P⁺(C₆H₅)₃CH₃.
 

The charge control agent is nonleachable from the 
polyurethane and is present in an amount sufficient to 

impart a selected amount of electric charge resistivity 
to the polyurethane.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a particle transfer 
film comprising a substrate material coated with a 
polyurethane copolymerized with a charge control agent. 
The invention also relates to a method of cleaning 
conveyance elements using the particle transfer film. In any converting process, such as in support 
manufacturing or photographic film sensitizing/finishing 
operations, or document duplicators, particulate 
contamination inevitably collect on conveyance elements 
(e.g idler rollers, coating rollers, vacuum drive 
rollers, etc). Often these particles dislodge and 
contaminate the product causing a variety of defects. 
Contamination remaining on the conveyance elements cause 
other product defects such as surface impressions and 
digs. It is often advantageous to clean the 
conveyance elements without significantly interrupting 
the operation by simply conveying a material containing 
an adhesive layer after or before a production run. The 
adhesive layer removes the particulate contamination as 
it makes contact with the conveyance elements. A 
disadvantage of using this method is the high electrical 
static charge generated as the adhesive material 
separates from the conveyance elements thus often causing 
excessive electrical discharge. The discharge is not only 
hazardous to personnel but can be quite dangerous such as 
in a manufacturing process utilizing volatile solvents or 
in a photographic film process where the film can be 
easily exposed (fogged) by the light generated. A charge 
control agent can be added to the adhesive to control the  
 
static discharge. Charge control agents work by leaching 
out of the adhesive, collecting on the adhesive surface 
and, being by design very hydrophilic, collect moisture 
from the surrounding environment. The moisture laden 
charge control agent provides a mechanism for electron 
movement to ground thus preventing charge buildup. 
Eventually, with use, enough of the charge control agent 
is removed from the adhesive so as to significantly 
diminish or eliminate the static dissipating ability of 
the adhesive, thus limiting the useful life of the 
cleaning material. Also, the charge control agent can 
collect on the conveyance elements and subsequently 
contaminate product. It is therefore desirable to have a 
cleaning material having a non-leaching and permanent 
charge control agent; by definition this cleaning 
material is to be called particle transfer film to 
differentiate it from other material having leachable 
constituents. It is an object
