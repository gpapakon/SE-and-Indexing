<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to biodegradable articles 
and particularly to thin-walled articles such as 
starch-based films (sheets) which are substantially 
insoluble in water and can constitute effective 
liquid-, gas- and vapour-barriers. EP-A-0 032 802 describes the production of 
self-supporting, flexible and biodegradable films 
produced from formulations including starch, 
ethylene-acrylic acid copolymer and polyethylene. EP-A-0 400 532 describes the production of films which 
have good mechanical characteristics and are produced 
from formulations based on starch and ethylene-vinyl 
alcohol copolymer. The films produced according to the methods of the 
patent applications cited above have good tear strength 
and resistance to dissolving in water and can therefore 
be used to replace conventional, non-biodegradable 
synthetic, thermoplastic materials for a wide range of 
applications. In the presence of water, however, the 
films tend to swell, which adversely affects their 
properties as gas- and vapour-barriers. EP-A-0 388 924 describes composite films including a 
layer of starch and a synthetic thermoplastic polymer 
and a layer of a barrier material which is deposited or 
laminated onto the starchy layer and is constituted by 
a copolymer or terpolymer of vinylidene chloride, 
copolymers of vinyl chloride and methyl acrylate, 
copolymers or terpolymers of vinylidene chloride and 
vinylidene fluoride, copolymer of ethylene-vinyl  
 
alcohol and nylon with polyvinylidene chloride. W090/14938 describes a method of producing films which 
are derived from starch with a high amylose content and 
can be laminated with polymeric materials having 
barrier properties, such as polypropylene, 
polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride, polycarbonate, 
polystyrene, polyesters, ionomer resins, acrylates and 
nylon. The object of the present invention is to provide a 
laminated film which has good mechanical and barrier 
properties whilst its biodegradability characteristics 
remain unchanged or are improved. For this purpose, the subject of the invention is a 
laminated film including at least one first layer of 
polymeric material including starch and at least one 
second layer of hydrophobic material, characterised in 
that the second layer includes a natural or synthetic 
wax. In a first embodiment, the hydrophobic material is 
constituted essentially by natural or synthetic wax. 
The natural waxes include: 
petroleum waxes, such as paraffin waxes with n-alkane 
contents of from about 75% to about 100% by
