<ABSTRACT>
A bulb socket for receiving a bulb which has a plus 
electrode and a minus electrode comprises a socket housing, a 

plus terminal and a minus terminal. The plus terminal is 
mounted in the socket housing, and includes a bulb-side plus 

terminal portion for electrically connecting with the plus 
electrode of the bulb and a feeder-side plus terminal portion 

for electrically connecting with an external plus terminal. 
The bulb-side plus terminal portion and the feeder-side plus 

terminal portion are disposed in a juxtaposed condition 
within the socket hosing. The minus terminal is mounted in 

the socket housing, and includes a bulb-side minus terminal 
portion for electrically connecting with the minus electrode 

of the bulb and a feeder-side minus terminal portion for 
electrically connecting with an external minus terminal. The 

bulb-side minus terminal portion and the feeder-side minus 
terminal portion are disposed in a juxtaposed condition 

within the socket hosing.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a bulb socket suited for use,
for example, in a combination lamp of a vehicle.For example, in a rear combination lamp of a vehicle, a
bulb is attached through a bulb socket to a back cover
mounted between a trunk room and a rear portion of the vehicle.
In such a bulb socket as shown in Fig. 4, a socket
housing 2 of a substantially tubular shape is mountod
through a gasket 1b in a mounting hole la in a back cover
1. Engagement pins 3b projecting from a peripheral surface
of a base 3a of the bulb 3 are engaged respectively in
J-shaped grooves 2a formed in an inner peripheral surface
of the socket housing 2. The bulb 3 is fitted in the socket
housing 2 to be fixed thereto. A plus metal terminal 4 and
a minus metal terminal 5 are provided within the socket
housing 2 in which the bulb 3 is to be fitted. A bulb-side
plus terminal 4a, which is curved into a S-shape, and is
adapted to contact a plus metal terminal 3c of the bulb 3,
is formed at one end of the plus metal terminal 4, and a
feeder-side male terminal 4b, constituting a feeder-side
connection portion, is formed at the other end of this plus
metal terminal. A bulb-side minus terminal 5a, adapted to
abut against the base 3a of the bulb 3, is formed at one
end of the minus metal terminal 5. A feeder-side male terminal
(not shown), constituting a feeder-side connection
portion, is formed at the other end of this minus metal
terminal. The feeder-side male terminal 4b is disposed
within a connector housing 6 which is projected downwardly
beyond a bottom surface 2b of the socket housing 2. The
feeder-side male terminal 4b is connected to a female terminal
8, which is insertod into the connector housing 6
through a rubber ring 7, to constitute the feeder-side connection
portion. The feeder-side male terminal 4b is connected
to an exterior feeder side. This feeder-side connection
portion is projected from the bottom surface 2b of the 
socket housing 2 by a distance generally equal to the overall
length of the female terminal 8.However, the above bulb socket has the feeder-side connection
portion projected long from the bottom surface 2b
of the socket housing 2, and therefore the dimension of the
the bulb socket projecting from the back cover 1 toward the
trunk room is long. As a result, when the bulb socket is
mounted on the back cover mounted in a lamp-mounting space
formed between the trunk room and the rear portion of the
vehicle, the dimension of the bulb socket projecting from
the back cover toward the trunk room is long, so

a plus terminal (32) mounted in said bulb hood (24),
said plus terminal (32) being bent so as to have a bulb-side

plus terminal piece (33) inside said bulb hood (24)
for electrically connecting with the plus electrode of said

bulb (B) and a feeder-side plus terminal piece (34) extending
out of said bulb hood (24)) for electrically connecting

with an external plus terminal, said bulb-side plus terminal
piece (33) and said feeder-side plus terminal piece

(34) being disposed such that said feeder-side plus terminal
piece (34) does not extend beyond the plane of a bottom

surface (21a) of said socket housing (21); and
a minus terminal (31) mounted in said bulb hood (24),
said minus terminal (31) being bent so as to have a bulb-side

minus terminal piece (36) inside said bulb hood (24)
for electrically connecting with the minus electrode of

said bulb (B) and a feeder-side minus terminal piece (37)
extending out of said bulb hood (24) for electrically connecting

with an external minus terminal, said bulb-side minus
terminal piece (36) and said feeder-side minus terminal

piece (37) being disposed such that said feeder-side minus
terminal piece (37) does not extend beyond the plane of

said bottom surface (21a) of said socket housing (21),
wherein said feeder-side plus terminal piece (34) and said

feeder-side minus terminal piece (37) extend in respective
connection holes (44a, 44b) defined between said socket

housing (21) and said bulb hood (24).
