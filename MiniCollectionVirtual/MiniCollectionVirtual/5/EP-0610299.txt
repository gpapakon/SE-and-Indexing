<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an adjustable steering column 
assembly for a vehicle. An example of a power tiltable steering wheel is shown in 
US-A-4 934 737 which shows the pre-characterising features 
of claim 1. Such an arrangement, however, provides a 
so-called neck tilt of the steering wheel in which the 
whole of the casting is pivoted and swivelled about a pivot 
point located close to the steering wheel which provides a 
sharp angular change of tilt, with consequent disadvantage 
to the driver. According to the present invention, there is provided an 
adjustable steering column assembly for a vehicle, 
comprising a steering column incorporating a prime mover 
mounted on a part of the steering column assembly for the 
tilting adjustment of the steering column, there being a 
pivot linkage connecting the prime mover and the steering 
column and incorporating a lever connecting the prime mover 
with an outer steering column member, one end of said lever 
being coupled to said outer steering column member, and the 
other end of the lever being pivotally linked to said prime 
mover, which has a reciprocating arm to turn the lever 
about its pivot, characterised in that said prime mover is 
pivotably mounted on said part of the steering column 
assembly, in that said lever is a bell crank lever with 
said one end thereof being pivotally coupled to said outer 
steering column member and said pivot being an intermediate 
pivot about which it is turned by said reciprocating arm, 
and in that said steering column is pivotable at an end of 
its major longitudinal extent remote from a steering wheel 
thereof to allow the column to be tiltably adjusted and  
 
the intermediate part of the bell crank lever being 
pivotally mounted to a fixed part spaced from said steering 
column. Preferably, the prime mover is an electric motor. The 
motor can be pivotably mounted on a part of the steering 
column. For a better understanding of the invention and to show how 
the same may be carried into effect, reference will now be 
made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawing, in 
which:- 
Figure 1 is a diagrammatic side view of an adjustable 
steering column assembly for a vehicle comprising a 
steering column incorporating a prime mover for the 
adjustment of the steering column,  
 Figure 2 is a diagrammatic sectional view taken on the line 
II-II in Figure 1, and Figure 3 is a view similar to Figure 2 taken on the line 
III-III in Figure 1. The drawing shows a vehicle steering column 1 with a 
steering wheel 2 at

<CLAIMS>
An adjustable steering column assembly for a vehicle, 
comprising a steering column (1) incorporating a prime 

mover (13) mounted on a part (5) of the steering column 
assembly for the tilting adjustment of the steering column, 

there being a pivot linkage connecting the prime mover and 
the steering column and incorporating a lever (6) 

connecting the prime mover with an outer steering column 
member (5), one end (6A) of said lever being coupled to 

said outer steering column member (5), and the other end 
(6B) of the lever being pivotally linked to said prime 

mover, which has a reciprocating arm (12) to turn the lever 
about its pivot (10), characterised in that said prime 

mover (13) is pivotably mounted on said part (5) of the 
steering column assembly, in that said lever is a bell 

crank lever (6) with said one end thereof being pivotally 
coupled to said outer steering column member (5) and said 

pivot (10) being an intermediate pivot (10) about which it 
is turned by said reciprocating arm, and in that said 

steering column (1) is pivotable at an end (4) of its major 
longitudinal extent remote from a steering wheel (2) 

thereof to allow the column to be tiltably adjusted and 
the intermediate part of the bell crank lever being 

pivotally mounted (10) to a fixed part (7) spaced from said 
steering column. 
An assembly according to claim 1, wherein said prime 
mover is an electric motor. 
An assembly according to claim 1 or 2 and being 
arranged such that the steering column is adjustable in a 

vertical plane through which the major axis of the column 
passes.  

 
An assembly according to claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein a 
pivotable coupling (3) in the form of a universal joint is 

provided at said end (4) of the column remote from said 
steering wheel.
