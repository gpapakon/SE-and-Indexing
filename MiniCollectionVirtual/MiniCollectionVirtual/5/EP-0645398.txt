<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
crystallizing N2-((S)-1-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-N6-trifluoroacetyl-L-lysyl-L-proline
which is useful as an
intermediate for the preparation of an inhibitor of
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), Lisinopril
(N2-((S)-1-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl)-L-lysyl-L-proline).N2-((S)-1-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-N6-trifluoroacetyl-L-lysyl-L-proline
can be prepared by a
method described in JP-A-61036297 which corresponds to EP-A-0 168 769,
and the like. As a method for isolation
and purification of thus obtained N2-((S)-1-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-N6-trifluoroacetyl-L-lysyl-L-proline,
the crystallizing method is extremely easy.
EP-A-0 168 769 discloses a crystallizing method using methyl
tert-butyl ether/cyclohexane (650ml/240ml).EP -A- 0 336 368 discloses crystallization using methyl tert-butyl ether / cyclohexane (5.5 ml
/ 2 ml). US -A- 4,786,737 discloses crystallization using methyl tert-butyl ether /
cyclohexane (300 ml / 110 ml). Also, in
Journal of Organic Chemistry, 53, 836-843 (1988), there
is disclosed a crystallizing method using methyl
tert-butyl ether/cyclohexane or methyl tert-butyl ether/hexanes
(C6H14) (225ml/85ml cyclohexane). However, as to
the methods using these solvents as crystallizing
solvents, there are problems that the solvents are highly
hazardous and that the crystal properties of the resulting
N2-((S)-1-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-N6-trifluoroacetyl-L-lysyl-L-proline
is unfavorable.
Therefore these methods are not necessarily preferable.
Due to the unfavorable crystal properties, solid-liquid
separation takes a lot of time and mother liquor cannot be
sufficiently replaced when washing the cake. Further, once
obtained crystal easily melts or becomes oily (syrupy). 
So, during the solid-liquid separating step to drying step,
there arise following problems. That is the molten or
oily state of some or most of the crystal results in
unsuccessful separation and collection thereof. Also, the
extreme difficulty of the removal of solvents from the
obtained oily matter or molten matter, requires
a lot of time for the drying step or results in stopping of the drying
step halfway.Preliminary research of the present inventors
for crystallizing solvents other than methyl tert-butyl
ether/cyclohexane or methyl tert-butyl ether/hexanes
(C6H14) has shown problems that N2-((S)-1-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-N6-trifluoroacetyl-L-lysyl-L-proline
is
not crystallized or is obtained only in an oily state, or
even if gelled matter is obtained,
