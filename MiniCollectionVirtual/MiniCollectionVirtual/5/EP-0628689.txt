<ABSTRACT>
The stop plate (6) is connected to a drive shaft (8). The plate is also connected with the gate shaft (2) via the stop wheel (3). The plate engages in rotary direction on the stop wheel, by one or more drive cams (9,10) and via return springs (11). The cams engage into grooves (12) of the stop wheel, which also contain the return springs. The recesses (7) in the stop plate, and the collection chambers (14) in the housing section (5a), are quadrant-shaped.

<CLAIMS>
Crash-down protection for doors or the like, with 
a blocking wheel (3) arranged fixedly in terms of rotation 

on a door shaft (2) and having receiving spaces (4) 
for blocking bodies (1), said receiving spaces being 

distributed over the entire circumference and open 
radially outwards and being formed by supporting surfaces, 

with a fixed housing (5) which is stationary 
relative to the door shaft (2) and the inner face of 

which surrounds the blocking wheel (3) at a distance 
smaller than the radial diameter of each blocking body 

(1) and which, on the said inner face, has catching 
chambers (14) for the blocking bodies (1), and with a 

blocking disc (6) which engages over the blocking wheel 
(3) and which
 has, on the inner face, recesses (7) for 
the blocking bodies (1), the said recesses being open 

radially inwards, whilst the catching chambers (14), in 
cooperation with the recesses (7), can form a recess for 

receiving a blocking body (1), characterized in that 

a) the blocking disc (6) is connected fixedly in terms 
of rotation to a drive shaft (8), and 
b) the blocking disc (6) is connected to the door shaft 
(2), with the blocking wheel (3) being interposed, 

in that the blocking disc (6) bears on the blocking 
wheel (3) in the direction of rotation by means of 

one or more drive cams (9, 10) with return springs 
(11) being interposed. 
Crash-down protection according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the cams (9, 10) engage in grooves 

(12) of the blocking wheel (3), in which grooves the  
 

return springs (11) are also arranged. 
Crash-down protection according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the recesses (7) in the blocking 

disc (6) and the catching chambers (14) in the housing 
part (5a) are designed in the form of a quadrant.
