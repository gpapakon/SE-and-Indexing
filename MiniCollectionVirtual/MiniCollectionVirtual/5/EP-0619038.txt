<ABSTRACT>
The method described for the calibration of coin-checking devices, as well as the calibration device used, is based on the use of normal coins, requires only few on-line measurements and is therefore suitable for use in the field. The calibration is based on the adjustment of predetermined coin-acceptance limits specific to the type of coin concerned.

least one measuring device (2, 3), means (4) for the 

evaluation of measured values and for the recognition of
