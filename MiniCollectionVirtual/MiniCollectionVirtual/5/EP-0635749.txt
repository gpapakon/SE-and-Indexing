<ABSTRACT>
According to the present invention, there is 
provided a liquid crystal panel frame used for a 

liquid crystal display which comprises a pair of 
opposed substrates, a pair of electrodes formed on 

each of those substrates, a plurality of rectilinear 
barrier members provided at predetermined intervals 

between both substrates and an orientation film formed 
on said substrates and being subjected to a rubbing 

process. Each barrier member extends in substantially 
parallel to the rubbing direction. By adhering each 

barrier member to the substrate opposed thereto, a 
plurality of narrowly partitioned rectilinear spaces 

in which portions other than an aperture formed at the 
end portion thereof through which the liquid crystal 

passes are sealed against liquid. Ferroelectric or 
anti-ferroelectric liquid crystals are encapsulated 

into each of those rectilinear spaces to form a liquid 
crystal panel assembly. After the encapsulated liquid 

crystal is held to a high temperature, that liquid 
crystal panel assembly is sequentially cooled down 

from one end of the rectilinear space toward the other 
end thereof under the condition in which the 

temperature gradient is kept appearing along the 
rubbing direction, to thereby obtain a defect-free 

orientated chiral smectic phase in the liquid crystal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid crystal
display used in the industrial field, office automation or
domestic use and the like and, specifically, to a liquid
crystal panel frame used for the liquid crystal display, and to the use of that display.
Further, the present invention relates to a liquid crystal
panel assembly formed by encapsulating the liquid crystal into
the same liquid crystal panel frame. Still further, the
present invention relates to a method for
manufacturing the same liquid crystal panel assembly. More
specifically, the present invention relates to a method of
controlling the alignment of liquid crystal of the liquid
crystal panel assembly in which ferroelectric or
anti-ferroelectric liquid crystals are used.Liquid crystal displays (LCD), which can be made of
lightweight and thin materials, are widely used as displays
for small size electronic calculators, measuring instruments
such as a tester or the like, and for displaying graphics or
characters on them for decoration or POP purposes. Recently,
it is also used as a large capacity thin terminal display 
adapted for a television set for displaying pictures
dynamically in full colors by using thin film transistors
(TFT), or for a personal computer or work station.The foregoing various displays mainly utilize shuttering
performance inherent to the liquid crystal, and the typical
liquid crystals exhibiting the shuttering performance include
twisted nematic type liquid crystals, super twisted nematic
(STN) type liquid crystals or the like utilizing nematic
phase. Further, there are also available ferroelectric liquid
crystals or anti-ferroelectric liquid crystals or the like
utilizing chiral smectic phase. These liquid crystal are
described in detail in :
(1) "Liquid Crystal" written and edited by Kobayashi and
Okano, Baifuhkan, 1985;(2) "Structure and Physical Properties of Ferroelectric
Liquid Crystal" written by Fukuda and Takezoe, Corona
Corporation, 1990;(3) "Next Generation Liquid Display and Liquid Crystal
Material" edited by Fukuda; CMC corporation, 1992.The ferroelectric liquid crystal(FLC) was proposed
by Clark et al (Japanese Patent Laid-Open 56-107216, U.S.P.
specification No.4367924). Further, the anti-ferroelectric
liquid crystal(AFLC) was found by A.D.L. Chandani et al.,
(Japanese Journal of Applied Physics, Vol 28, L1256 (1989).
Since any of them has the so-called storage effect, it is
expected that a large capacity display can be realized by
driving a simple matrix addressing drive without using active
elements
