<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a canvas-rubber complex, a V-ribbed 
belt using it and a method of producing a V-ribbed 
belt. As for the V-ribbed belt, in particular, it relates to 
a V-ribbed belt suitably used as an auxiliary driving belt for 
driving an auxiliary for automobile which is driven by an 
engine such as a generator, a cooling fan, an oil pump, in 
such a manner as to take a driving power from the back of the 
belt. Conventionally, the V-ribbed belt has both of flexibility 
as in a flat belt and high transmissibility as in a V-belt. 
For this reason, the V-ribbed belt has been widely used as an 
suitable belt for driving an auxiliary for automobile. The V-ribbed 
belt is composed of, for example, a tension rubber 
located on the belt back side, a compression rubber located 
inside of the belt, and tension members which are arranged 
between the tension rubber and the compression rubber and 
extend in a longitudinal direction of the belt. A plurality of 
grooves in the form of V in section are continuously formed at 
the compression rubber in the longitudinal direction of the 
belt. An upper surface of the tension rubber which serves as  
 
the belt back is covered with a covering canvas. Both faces of the covering canvas are coated with rubber 
or subjected to RFL (resorcin formaldehyde latex) adhesion 
treatment. In detail, for example, one face of the covering 
canvas is coated with a rubber composition based on a compounding 
example including ingredients as shown in Table 1 
(conventional compounding example) by frictioning according to 
a calender and successively, another face of the covering 
canvas is coated by the same manner. In this case, the weight 
of rubber coated on the canvas is in a range from about 230 to 
300 g/m2 as both faces of the covering canvas. The rubber is 
provided so as to be deposited on the face of the covering 
canvas which is located on the back face's side of the V-ribbed 
belt at the rate of 70 to 80 % thereof and on the other 
face of the covering canvas at the remaining rate of 30 to 20 
%, respectively.
