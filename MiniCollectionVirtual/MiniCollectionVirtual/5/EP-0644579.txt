<ABSTRACT>
In a semiconductor device burn-in apparatus, a film 
(32) on which a plurality of TAB products (10), each 

having a semiconductor device (12) thereon, are arranged 
in succession and a flexible tape-like wiring board (15) 

which is situated in the same plane as, and in parallel 
to, the film (32) and on which electrically conductive 

wiring patterns are formed are detachably clamped by 
sockets, in units of one of the TAB products. The film 

(32) and the wiring board (15) are electrically connected 
by a wiring board provided on each socket. 

The film, wiring board (15) and socket (18) are 
stored in a storage member (27) as a combined structure 

having an elongated shape, and the combined structure is 
subjected to a burn-in process.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor 
device burn-in apparatus, wherein a plurality of 
TAB (Tape Automated Bonding) products, which are 
arranged on a film in succession and on which semiconductor 
devices are mounted respectively, and a flexible 
tape-like wiring board are juxtaposed, the TAB 
products and the wiring board are fixed by sockets so 
that they are electrically connected in units of a TAB 
product, and the TAB products, with the sockets being 
mounted thereon, are subjected to a burn-in process in 
the form of elongated members wound in reels. In the prior art, in a burn-in process, TAB products 
on which semiconductor devices are mounted are subjected 
to an environment test, e.g. a high-temperature 
resistance test, in the power-on state. As is shown in 
FIG. 1, the burn-in process is performed on a structure 
in which sockets 3 are provided to correspond respectively 
to semiconductor devices on a plurality of TAB 
products 2 arranged on a plate-like wiring board 1. 
These sockets 3 are electrically connected to electrically 
conductive wiring patterns 4. The sockets 3 are 
further connected via a connector 5 to an external power 
supply line, a ground line and a signal line. The conventional burn-in process is performed after 
the wiring board 1 is cut into strips at predetermined 
length.  However, while the wiring board 1 is being cut into 
strips, the wiring patterns 4 provided on the wiring 
board 1 may come into contact with a worker or a jig, 
resulting in deformation, occurrence of static 
electricity, physical or electrical destruction, or 
deterioration in reliability of the devices. If the interval of the TAB products provided on the 
wiring board 1 is short, TAB products at the cutting 
areas may be cut. Three Jap. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publications 
Nos. 61-185949, 2-45949 and 2-266275 show prior-art 
techniques for performing burning processes in the state 
in which semiconductor devices are mounted on elongated 
members. In these techniques, however, portions for 
power supply, grounding and signal supply need to be 
added to tape patterns in order to perform the burn-in 
process. This contradicts to the reduction in size and 
cost of products. On the other hand, in the technique shown in Jap. 
Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication No. 4-130279, the size of 
a TAB product is not so great, but the size of the 
entire apparatus is great. Thus, it is not possible to 
perform the burn-in for one reel (24m) without cutting 
it. In the prior art, sockets with specified sizes
