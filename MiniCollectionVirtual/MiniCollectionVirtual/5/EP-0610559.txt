<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a clamping and/or clinch joining apparatus for the positionally accurate spot fixing of two objects, particularly flat workpieces such as sheets or the like, consisting of an apparatus frame (1) with a clamping or clinch joining punch (2) which can be actuated by an actuating mechanism (KM) and under which, in a cantilever-like counter support (3) of the apparatus frame (1), is arranged a workpiece rest (4) axially aligned with the clamping or clinch joining punch (2). According to the invention, the counter support (3), which is rigidly connected to the apparatus frame (1), is formed from a part (3') which takes the clamping and clinch joining load and from a part (3'') which contains the workpiece support (4) in a manner which allows it to be displaced axially in the direction of the load, a positionally fixed ball (5) being arranged between the lower end (4') of the workpiece support (4) and the part (3') which takes the load. As a result, the unavoidable bending can no longer disturb the positionally accurate axial alignment between the workpiece support and the clamping or clinch joining punch.

<CLAIMS>
A clamping and/or joining tool for accurately positioning and pointedly fixing two 
items, in particular, planar workpieces, such as plates or the like, comprising a machine 

frame (1) including a clamping or joining punch (2) driven by an actuating mechanism 
(KM), with a work support (4) in axial alignment with the clamping or joining punch 

(2) being arranged underneath the punch (2) within an abutment hold (3) of a 
cantilevered beam type, characterized in that the abutment hold (3) rigidly connected to 

the machine frame (1) is formed of a part (3') accommodating the clamping and joining 
load, and a part (3'') containing the work support (4) and axially displacing the same in 

the direction of the load, and that arranged between the bottom end (4') of the work 
support (4) and the load accommodating part (3') is an accurately positioned support 

(5) of a curved surface, such as a spherical or semi-spherical element or a semi-cylindrical 
strip. 
A tool according to claim 1 for positively joining of items, characterized in that the 
clamping or joining punch (2) is provided with a male mould (7) and the workpiece 

support (4) is provided with a female mould (8). 
A tool according to claims 1 or 2, characterized in that the load accommodating part 
(3') is arranged as a central cantilevered beam-type extension (6) on the machine frame 

(1) associated to which is the work support (4) containing part (3'') in the form of two 
supporting extensions (9) arranged in side-by-side and adjacent relationship on the 

machine frame (1), with a cross bar (10) bearing the work support (4) being located 
thereon. 
A tool according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the load 
accommodating part (3') is arranged on the machine frame (1) in a manner adjustable in 

height in the direction of the joining load.  
 
A tool according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the support 5 
formed as a ball is arranged within a spherical surface (11) of the part (3') 

accommodating the load and is fixed by a holding element, as by screw (12), within the 
spherical surface (11).
