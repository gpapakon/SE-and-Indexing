A process for preparing aqueous polymer dispersions 
modified with silanol groups and obtained by 

polymerization of 

A) from 90 to 99.2% by weight of at least one 
unsaturated monomer, 
B) in addition, from 0.5 to 5% by weight of at least 
one unsaturated carboxylic acid, 
C) from 0.1 to 2% by weight of at least one further 
functional unsaturated monomer,
 
and 
D) from 0.2 to 3% by weight of low molecular weight 
epoxysilanes of the general formula 


 
where X
1
 is a (cyclo)alkyl radical which contains a 
reactive oxirane group and may contain ether groups 

and/or an aromatic radical, 

R
2
 is a (cyclo)alkoxy radical which may contain 
ether groups, or a (cyclo)alkyl, aryl or aralkyl 

radical,  
 
R
3
 and R
4
 are each independently of one another, a 
(cyclo)alkoxy radical which may contain ether 

groups, or a hydroxyl radical, characterized in that 
the modification is carried out by polymer-analogous 

reaction of the epoxysilanes D in the presence of at 
least one or more of the monomers A-C, where the 

epoxysilane is metered in 

i) before commencement of the polymerization over a 
certain period of time or over the entire time of 

the feed stream addition
 
or 
ii) after a certain period of time after commencement 
of the feed stream addition, 
 
and the polymerization reaction is carried out 

semicontinuouely. 
A process according to claim 1, characterized in 
that linear or branched vinyl esters having from 1 

to 18 carbon atoms, vinyl aromatics, dienes, (meth)acrylic 
esters having from 1 to 12 carbon atoms, 

esters of maleic or fumaric acid having from 1 to 8 
carbon atoms, α-olefins or vinyl chloride are used 

as monomers A. 
A process according to either of claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that (meth)acrylic acid, maleic 

acid, fumaric acid or itaconic acid are used as 
monomers B. 
A process according to any of claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that amides of unsaturated carboxylic 

acids, unsaturated sulphonic acids, hydroxyalkyl 
(meth)acrylates or unsaturated silanes are used as 

functional unsaturated monomers C.  
 
A process according to claim 4, characterized in 
that the amides of (meth)acrylic acid, maleic acid, 

fumaric acid or itaconic acid are used.

3-glycidylozypropyltriethoxysilane, 3-glycidyloxypropylmethyldimethoxysilane, 
3-glycidyloxypropyltris(2-methoxyethoxy)silane, 

3-(3,4-epoxycyclohexyl)ethyltrimethoxysilane 
are used as monomers D. 
A process according to any of claims 1 to 6, characterized 
in that molecular weight regulators and/or 

crosslinking monomers are used. 
A process according to any of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the polymerization temperature 

is from 40 to 90°C, preferably 60-85°C, and the pH 
of the polymerization is from 1.5 to 6.0, preferably 

2.0-4.5. 
Use of the polymer dispersions prepared according to 
any of claims 1 to 8 for producing binders for the 

building protection sector. 
Use according to claim 9 for producing paints, in 
particular emulsion paints, polymer renders and 

building adhesives, in particular for tile 
adhesives.
