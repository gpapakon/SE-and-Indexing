<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to hydrogen peroxide
compositions that may be used to clean surfaces.Hydrogen peroxide is widely known as an
excellent hard surface sterilant and disinfectant that
is environmentally safe and cost effective. Other
sterilant/disinfectant agents such as phenolics and
aldehydes are not as environmentally and
toxicologically as sound as hydrogen peroxide.
For example, although glutaraldehyde compositions are
widely used among infection control staff,
glutaraldehydes are associated with disadvantages such
as skin sensitization, toxicity and chemical waste
management.Despite its superior efficacy for
disinfecting and sterilization uses, hydrogen peroxide
has not been widely used in medical facilities for
cleaning hard metal surfaces because hydrogen peroxide
oxidizes metals, such as, copper and brass. Many
hospital instruments and devices contain copper and/or
brass components which may become irreversibly damaged
by corrosion when exposed to hydrogen peroxide
solutions.Previous attempts to reduce the corrosive
effects of hydrogen peroxide solutions have been met
with only limited success. For example, when known
corrosion inhibitors such as phenyl sulfonic acid,
phosphate esters, sodium molybdate, alkanolamines, or
benzotriazoles are used, the anti-corrosive activity is
either too short-term (because the inhibitor is
unstable in the presence of hydrogen peroxide); not
observed at all; or the resulting composition leaves an
undesirable oxide film residue on hard surfaces upon
drying.In particular, the anti-corrosive agents
1,2,3-benzotriazole and tolyltriazole are known to 
decrease the corrosive activity of hydrogen peroxide.
Both, however, are unstable in the presence of hydrogen
peroxide and lose effectiveness after a short storage
period. The Comparative Examples hereinafter
illustrate the limited stability of 1,2,3-benzotriazole
and tolyltriazole in hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen
peroxide compositions with these anti-corrosive agents
have a very short shelf life and because the
compositions are unstable neither have become accepted
compositions useful for cleaning metal surfaces.Corrosion associated with hydrogen peroxide
compositions remains a problem. A stable hydrogen
peroxide composition providing a sterilant or
disinfectant activity without promoting corrosion to
metal surfaces treated with the composition is needed.The problem described above has been solved
with the discovery of a hydrogen peroxide based aqueous
composition comprising:
a) from 0.1 to 25 weight % of a methyl
