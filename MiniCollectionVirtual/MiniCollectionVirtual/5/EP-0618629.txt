<ABSTRACT>
A battery separator comprising a microporous sheet 
product having first and second major surfaces and a 

thickness of less than about 50 mils, formed from a uniform 
mixture of a polymer and a filler or polymer and a 

structure enhancing agent and optionally a filler and 
having a porous sheet embedded between the first and second 

major surface. The porosity of the sheet product is at 
least about 50 volume percent having a pore distribution 

such that the nominal pore diameter increases from each 
major surface towards the interior central portion of the

<DESCRIPTION>
The subject invention is directed to a sheet product 
which is useful as separator components for batteries and 
to improved batteries containing the formed separator. 
More specifically, the present invention is directed to a 
thin microporous sheet product composed of a highly filled 
polymeric matrix or a low level filled (including 
unfilled) polymeric matrix having a porous support sheet 
embedded between the sheet products first and second major 
surfaces and having an average pore size distribution 
across the thickness of the sheet product such that there 
is a gradient of nominal pore size increasing from each 
major surface towards the central, interior portion of the 
sheet product's thickness.  Membranes have been formed from various materials and 
used in various applications such as in ion exchange, 
osmotic and ultra filtration devices including 
desalinazation, kidney dialysis, gas separation and other 
applications. Macro and microporous membranes have been 
used as a means of insulating and separating electrodes in 
battery devices. Each application provides an environment 
and a set of desired parameters which are distinct to the 
specific application. Storage batteries have at least one pair of 
electrodes of opposite polarity and, in general, have 
series of adjacent electrodes of alternating polarity. 
The current flow between these electrodes is maintained by 
an electrolyte which may be acidic, alkaline, or 
substantially neutral depending upon the nature of the 
battery system. Separators are located in batteries 
between adjacent electrodes of opposite polarity to 
prevent direct contact between the oppositely charged  
 
electrode plates while freely permitting electrolytic 
conduction. Separator components have taken many forms. 
In a modern battery design, the separator is in the form 
of a thin sheet or film or more preferably, a thin 
envelope surrounding each electrode plate of one polarity. It is generally agreed that one of the critical 
elements in a battery design is the separator component 
and, to be highly effective in the design, the separator 
should have a combination of features. The battery 
separator must be resistant to degradation and instability 
with respect to the battery environment, including the 
other battery components and the battery chemistry. Thus, 
the battery separator must be capable of withstanding 
degradation of strong acids (such as sulfuric acid 
commonly used in acid battery designs) or strong alkali 
(such as potassium hydroxide used in
