<ABSTRACT>
There is provided a process for manufacturing woven or
knitted fabrics comprising modifying the woven or knitted fabrics

by applying a skeleton triazine cross-linking reaction using a
sericin fixing method of raw silk to enhance its shrink and crease

resistance and shape stability and thereafter removing the sericin
using a special scouring.
The process for manufacturing a woven or knitted fabric,
comprises the steps of finishing and treating raw silk and/or

cellulose fibers by using a silk sericin fixing method; doubling and
twisting thus finished/treated raw silk and/or cellulose fibers;

weaving or knitting the doubled and twisted yarns; swelling the
woven or knitted fabric forming a cloth by dipping it in a bath;

and, scouring the woven or knitted fabric swelled in the bath with
an enzyme whereby the woven or knitted fabric is provided with

shrink and crease resistance and shape stability.

<DESCRIPTION>
The art of manufacturing fabrics using silk which is a
natural material has been traditionally succeeded. The fabrics
have specific feeling, beautiful gloss and softness, in particular
both air-permeability and hygroscopicity properties.The silk yarn comprises a pair of fibroin portions, which is
covered with an outer layer of sericin. The so-called "silk
products" are manufactured by removing sericin which is a glue
type protein from the silk yarns and weaving or knitting the
sericin-removed silk yarns. It is deemed that the fibroin which is
one of the components of silk product consists of a plurality of
fibril molecules which are ester-bonded to each other. The silk
products have various problems since the bond between the fibril
molecules is weak. The silk fibers as natural material have not
been scientifically researched completely and has a number of
various unknown subjects.The same applies to cellulose fibers (including cellulose fiber
yarns) which are also manufactured from natural materials.The present invention enhances shrink and crease resistance
and shape stability of the silk yarn, cellulose fibers and their
twisted yarns of their conjugate fibers by treating and finishing 
them using a sericin fixing method to form a skeleton of triazine
or triazine bond in the fibers. Now, the properties of woven or
knitted fabrics made from the inventive yarns and fibers will be
shown.There have been proposed various finishing and treating
processes for conducting a method of fixing the sericin of the raw
silk. A number of various solvents have been developed for these
processes. However, the sericin which is a glue like protein
provides hard touch and low gloss. If the raw silk is dyed, the
sericin would be dissolved, resulting in that it will become hard to
use the raw silk as garment fibers.Accordingly, use of the sericin fixed type raw silk is limited
to only special fabrics referred to as "kiginu" (unscoured silk) such
as fabrics of silk organsee, chiffon, bolting cloth, Fuji silk. They
have appearance, touch and characteristics which are different
from those of the woven or knitted fabrics made from fibroin silk
in which the sericin has been removed by dissolution.Some of the sericin fixing methods use the materials as
follows: 1. aldehydes
formalin, glutaric aldehyde, dialdehyde starch, acrylic
aldehyde2. heavy metal salts
chrome alum, dichromic acid salts + reducing agent,
aluminum alum, acrylic aldehyde3. tannin4. synthetic resins
melamines, DMEU, epoxides5. cyanuric chloride and
