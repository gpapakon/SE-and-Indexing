<ABSTRACT>
A semi-conductor die assembly comprises two naked dies 
(1,2) mounted "back to back" on a ceramic substrate (3). TAB 

bonded electrical connections (5) are made between the dies 
(1,2) and substrate (3). The assembly can be provided with a 

lid (8) and external connecting pins to form a compact, 
low-profile package. The invention is particularly applicable 

to mass memory systems and its inherent reliability makes it 
ideal for use in space craft and aircraft crash recorder 

applications.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of high density 
electronic circuits and particularly, to packaging 
semiconductor integrated circuits in applications requiring 
exceptionally high packing density at low cost. At present, when there is a need to package integrated 
circuits so that they and their associated interconnections 
occupy the minimum volume, it is usual to either use the 
devices in unencapsulated die form in a thick or thin film 
hybrid or a Multi Chip Module (see for example, EP-A-383296). 
The integrated circuits are attached to a substrate (which may 
be an integral part of the package) and electrically connected 
to it by wire bonding, Tape Automated Bonding (TAB) or flip 
chip techniques. These methods do not give the degree of 
packing density needed in extreme applications. Alternatively, custom die can be used in an edge stacking 
arrangement (see for example US 4,525,921). These have the 
disadvantages of necessitating the use of custom die which is 
both restrictive and expensive; the resulting assemblies, 
whilst compact, are relatively tall thus restricting the 
packaging efficiency at the next level of assembly. It is 
also a technique beyond the capability of most microelectronic 
packaging companies. This invention aims to provide a low profile assembly of 
devices occupying an area only slightly greater than that of 
one device, thereby almost doubling the packing density.  Accordingly, this invention comprises a semi-conductor 
die assembly comprising a substrate on a surface of which is 
mounted a pair of naked semi-conductor dies, said dies being 
arranged so that their inactive faces are adjacent to one 
another and so that the active face of one of the dies is 
adjacent to said substrate surface. The back-to-back configuration of the die pair minimises 
the risk of damaging their active faces during assembly. The substrate is a means for providing interconnection 
between the dies and external circuitry. The substrate area can be made large enough to 
accommodate further die pairs if required. The substrate can be formed, for example from 
multi-layer, co-fired material. This material is essentially 
ceramic and may incorporate metal conducting tracks, pads and 
vias. The substrate can be provided with a lid and external 
connecting pins to produce an integrated circuit package for 
connection to a printed circuit board. Some embodiments of the invention will now be described, 
by way of example only, with reference to the drawings of 
which: Figures 1 and 2 are
