<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus and method for forming a cover about 
an article and for automatically fastening the cover to the 

article, and optionally for automatically placing a label on 
the covered article. The article may be an article such as 

a potted plant and the cover may be a decorative cover. The 
apparatus comprises a platform (130) having at least one opening (142) 

sized to allow passage therethrough of an article. A 
conveyable cover forming assembly (146) is supported on a conveying 

assembly (154). A sheet of material can be supported in a position 
generally over the opening. The article can be pushed into 

the cover forming assembly, causing the sheet to be formed 
into a cover about the article. The apparatus also comprises 

a tying device (170) for automatically applying a band or fastener 
about a portion of the outer surface of the covered article 

for fastening the cover about the article after the sheet is 
formed into a cover about the article. The apparatus may 

further comprise a sheet feeder, a pick and place apparatus,

therethrough extends through the support surface. The support 
surface is adapted to support at least portions of a sheet of 
material in a position generally over a conveyable cover 
forming assembly or mold disposed near the opening in the 
support surface. The conveyable cover forming assembly or 
mold has contacting portions for contacting the sheet of 
material. The conveyable cover forming assembly or mold 
opening is sized and configured to receive the article. The apparatus may further comprise a fastening or 
tying device for automatically applying a fastener about a 
portion of the outer surface of the covered article for 
fastening the cover about the article after the cover is 
formed about the article.  The apparatus may further comprise conveying 
assembly or rail for conveying the covered article and 
conveyable cover forming assembly or mold from the cover 
forming position to a fastener application positioning at the 
fastening or tying device. The apparatus may also comprise a labeling device 
for automatically applying a label to a portion of the outer 
surface of the cover of the covered article. The apparatus 
may further comprise an assembly for automatically placing a 
sheet of material on the support surface. The present invention also relates to a method for 
processing an article. The process initially comprises 
providing a platform having a support surface formed
