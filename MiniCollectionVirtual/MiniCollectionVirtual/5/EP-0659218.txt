The electrolysis apparatus produces hydrogen and oxygen by decomposing electrolytic liquid with the aid of electric current. The apparatus comprises a closed pressurized electrolytic cell (10) for producing hydrogen and oxygen, a hydrogen line (23, 28) for conducting hydrogen out of the electrolytic cell (10) to a hydrogen storage (30), an oxygen line (22, 33) for conducting oxygen out of the electrolytic cell (10), and feed means (17, 18, 19, 20, 21) for supplying electrolytic liquid into the electrolytic cell. Between the pressure of the oxygen line (33) and the pressure of the hydrogen line (28) a given pressure difference is maintained by conducting the oxygen discharged from the system through one or more spring-loaded overflow valves (34) so that the pressure prevailing in the hydrogen line (28) is conducted to the spring side of the overflow valve (34).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a procedure for controlling pressure in an electrolysis 
apparatus producing hydrogen and oxygen by decomposing electrolytic liquid 
into hydrogen and oxygen with the aid of electric current. The invention also relates 
to an electrolysis apparatus for producing hydrogen in a variable-pressure electrolytic 
cell by decomposing electrolytic liquid with the aid of electric current into hydrogen 
and oxygen. Hydrogen is an ideal and non-polluting source of energy in special applications in 
which no conventional energy sources are available. Therefore, for instance in 
devices using electric current and located in sparsely populated and rough regions 
solar panels can be used for producing electric current. Such installations are 
frequently unmanned and require automatic or remote control operations. Such 
installations need to be operating also when there is no sunlight. Storing electricity 
only in batteries would require a very large number of batteries, particularly in 
northern latitudes, said batteries being heavy and requiring maintenance. Using hydrogen for storing energy is one of the means of recovering the surplus 
energy produced by solar cells, whereby water is decomposed into hydrogen and 
oxygen with the aid of electricity. In such instances electricity may, if needed, be 
produced with the aid of a fuel cell from hydrogen. In order to reduce the size of the 
hydrogen gas storages required, the hydrogen must, however, be pressurized and 
additional energy must be used for the pressurization. It is known in the art to accomplish the decomposition of water into hydrogen and 
oxygen in electrolytic cells operating under pressure and thus producing hydrogen 
directly in pressurized form, so that no separate pressurization is needed.  
 A drawback in pressurizing an electrolytic cell is, however, increase of leakages. It is also known in the art to place an electrolytic cell within a separate pressure 
shell, whereby the pressure difference between the inside and outside of the electrolytic 
cell substantially reduces and leakages decrease. Thus, in an apparatus as for 
instance in patent publication FR-2466515, the pressure shell has been pressurized 
with the aid of nitrogen gas, and the apparatus comprises means for maintaining the 
pressure within the electrolytic cell lower than the pressure of the pressure shell. Use 
of separate pressurizing gas requires, however, containers for the pressurizing gases 
and need of supplementing the pressurizing gas; the
