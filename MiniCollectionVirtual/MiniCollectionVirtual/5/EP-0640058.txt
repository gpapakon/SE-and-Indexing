<ABSTRACT>
A gas to be processed containing H2S is subjected to a step in which the hydrogen sulphide is catalytically oxidised (1a) into sulphur at a temperature of 60-180  DEG C so that a sulphur deposit is formed on the catalyst and the sulfur-loaded catalyst (1b) is periodically regenerated at 60-180  DEG C then cooled to enable it to be reused in the catalytic oxidation step.

Process for the removal of H
2
S 
contained in a gas in a concentration of less than 

5% by volume and recovery of this H
2
S in the form 
of sulphur, in which the gas to be treated, 

containing H
2
S, is brought, together with a gas 
containing free oxygen in a quantity which is 

suitable for producing an O
2
:H
2
S molar ratio of 
from 0.5 to 3, into contact with a catalyst for 

selective oxidation of H
2
S into sulphur, consisting 
of an active phase, formed of one or more oxides 

and/or salts of transition metals, deposited on a 
support of a refractory material, and the gas to 

be treated and the gas containing free oxygen are 
brought into contact with said catalyst in 

operating at temperatures which are maintained for 
the whole of the duration of said bringing into 

contact at values selected between 60°C and 180°C 
to oxidise, substantially quantitatively, the H
2
S 
present in said gas to be treated into sulphur, 

and to deposit the sulphur which has been formed 
onto the catalyst and to obtain a gaseous current 

which is practically free from H
2
S, said process 
being characterised in that the active phase of 

the oxidation catalyst originates from at least 
one of the metals nickel, silver and tungsten.  

 
Process according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the active phase of the 

oxidation catalyst originates from nickel. 
Process according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, 
characterised in that the support of the oxidation 

catalyst is selected from among bauxite, 
alumina, titanium oxide, zirconium oxide, 

zeolites, silica/alumina mixtures, 
silica/titanium oxide mixtures, silica and active 

carbon. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the oxidation catalyst has a 

porous volume, determined by the mercury 
penetration method, of 150 cm
3
 to 600 cm
3
 per litre 
of catalyst. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the time for which the 

gaseous reactive medium, formed of gas to be 
treated containing H
2
S and of gas containing free 
oxygen, is in contact with the oxidation catalyst 

is from 0.5 seconds to 20 seconds, and 
preferably from 1 second to 15 seconds, in normal 

pressure and temperature conditions.  
 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the active phase of the 

oxidation catalyst, counted by weight of metal, is 
0.1 to 15% and preferably 0.2 to 7% of the weight 

of said catalyst. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the oxidation catalyst, 

charged with sulphur, is periodically subjected to 
a regeneration, by sweeping said catalyst, 

directly following the oxidation, by means of a 
non-oxidant gas, at temperatures of between 200°C 

and 500°C and preferably of between 250°C and 
450°C, to vapourise the sulphur retained on the 

catalyst, and the regenerated catalyst is then 
cooled to a temperature of between 60°C and 180°C 

to perform the oxidation reaction anew, this 
cooling being produced by means of an inert gas. 
Process according to Claim 7, 
characterised in that the cooling gas is charged 

with water vapour, at least during the final phase 
of cooling of the regenerated catalyst. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that the gas to be treated 

containing H
2
S and the gas containing free oxygen 
are brought into contact with the oxidation  

 
catalyst at temperatures maintained within the 

range from 80°C to 140°C and preferably in the 
range from 90°C to 120°C. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that the gas to be treated 

contains H
2
S as the only sulphur-containing 
compound in a concentration of between 0.01% and 

5% and preferably between 0.1% and 3% by volume. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 
10, characterised in that the temperature at which 

the gas to be treated, containing H
2
S, and the gas 
containing free oxygen are brought into contact 

with the oxidation catalyst, is maintained, using 
a fluid circulating in indirect heat exchange with 

said catalyst. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 
10, characterised in that the catalytic oxidation 

of the H
2
S is performed in a reactor with several 
stages of the catalyst with cooling of the 

reactive mixture between the successive stages by 
indirect heat exchange with a cold fluid, the heat 

exchange being performed at the inside or at the 
outside of the oxidation reactor. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to  
 

12, characterised in that the gas to be treated, 
containing H
2
S, and the gas containing free oxygen, 
are brought into contact with the oxidation 

catalyst in such a manner that the O
