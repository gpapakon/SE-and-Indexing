A process for the production of three-dimensional
objects from a composition according to any one of

claims 1 to 7 by stereolithography, which comprises a
step of irradiating a layer of the composition over the

entire surface or in a predetermined pattern with a
UV/VIS light source, such that within the irradiated

areas a layer solidifies in a desired layer thickness,
then a new layer of the composition is formed on the

solidified layer, which layer is likewise irradiated
over the entire surface or in a predetermined pattern,

and such that by repeated coating and irradiation
three-dimensional objects are formed from a plurality

of solidified layers which adhere to one another.
