<ABSTRACT>
A method for recovering volatile components from 
reformer effluent condensate and fusel oil in a methanol 

plant is disclosed. The fusel oil is stripped with 
steam to produce an overhead vapor stream of steam and 

stripped organic components which is recycled to the 
feed to the reformer. Also disclosed are a methanol 

plant with a fusel oil stripper; and a unitized stripper 
column for treating fusel oil and process condensate 

wherein steam containing volatile gases stripped from 
the process condensate is used to strip the fusel oil. 

The present invention improves yield and reduces or 
eliminates liquid fusel oil waste by recycling volatile 

organic components contained in the fusel oil to the 
feed of the reformer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for methanol
synthesis with the aim of reducing or
eliminating the amount of fusel oil waste incinerated or
otherwise disposed of.Efforts to reduce manufacturing costs of chemical
products are on-going. Particular attention has been
directed to reducing energy costs by implementing heat
integration design, that is, the process-wide pairing of
heat-releasing streams with heat-accepting streams. In
addition, energy usage has been lowered by the adoption
of more thermodynamically efficient design of unit
processes such as distillation, heat exchange, and the
like. It is also advantageous to reduce the production
of liquid waste streams to lessen incineration or other
disposal costs which are imposed by ever-increasing
environmental concerns.In methanol production, fusel oil comprising
primarily aqueous methanol and other volatile organic
reaction by-products is a primary liquid waste stream.
It has been known to recycle the crude, untreated fusel
oil stream to the reformer feed, either directly to the
reformer inlet coils or by means of a feed gas saturator
on the reformer hydrocarbon gas feed. This has the
potential for damaging the reforming catalyst if the
fusel oil contains any solids such as methanol synthesis 
catalyst particles, caustic or other components carried
over from the methanol synthesis that can damage the
reforming catalyst. More commonly, fusel oil waste
streams have been burned as fuel to heat a reformer.
However, recent environmental thinking regards fusel oil
as a hazardous material unsuitable for incineration, and
has potentially increased the cost and complexity of
fusel oil disposal. Finally, reference is made to EP-A-0 040 481,
which teaches a methanol synthesis process, according to which the
fusel oil is treated in a stripper, whereby the organic materials
are separated out and recycled to the steam reforming step.This invention is directed to a method
for stripping fusel oil produced in a methanol
plant to permit the recovery and recycle of a major
proportion or all of the volatile organic components in
the fusel oil to the reformer, and to minimize the
proportion of the volatile organic components disposed
of as a waste stream. In such a manner, the yields of
synthesis gas, and consequently methanol, are enhanced
and the volume of potentially hazardous liquid waste
produced is reduced. More specifically, the present invention
provides a a process employing unitized stripper for fusel oil and process
condensate in from methanol plant
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A process for methanol synthesis comprising the steps of

(a) producing a methanol synthesis gas
(b) separating process condensate from the synthesis gas
(c) synthesizing methanol from the synthesis gas
(d) refining the methanol, thereby separating methanol and
a fusel oil stream,

characterized in that the process further comprises the
steps of
(e) passing the process condensate and the fusel oil stream
to a unitized stripper, whereby
(e1) the process condensate enters a lower stripping zone
(48) of the unitized stripper (40) through an upper

process condensate inlet (60) and is stripped by a
stripping steam and
(e2) the fusel oil enters an upper stripping zone (50) of
the unitized stripper (40) through an upper fusel oil

inlet (78) and is stripped by the stripping steam,
which is passed from the lower stripping zone (48) to

the upper stripping zone (50) through a passage (74),
and
(f) recovering a vapor stream at a vapor outlet (58)
adjacent to the top of the upper stripping zone (50),

comprising steam and volatile components stripped from
the process condensate and the fusel oil.
The process of claim 1, wherein the recovered vapor stream
is recycled to an inlet of a reforming reactor (14).
The process of claim 1 or 2, wherein the stripped process
condensate is removed from the lower stripping zone (48)

through an outlet (70). 
The process of any of claims 1 to 3, wherein the stripped
fusel oil is collected in a lower liquid collector (72) of

the upper stripping zone (50) and removed therefrom through
a liquid outlet (86).
The process of any of claims 1 to 4, wherein the process
condensate is stripped in vapor/liquid contact elements (68)

disposed between the upper process condensate inlet (60) and
a lower stripping steam inlet (52) of the lower stripping

zone (48).
The process of any of claims 1 to 5, wherein the fusel oil
is stripped in vapor/liquid contact elements (84) disposed

between the upper fusel oil inlet (78) and the lower liquid
collector (72) of the upper stripping zone (50) whereby the

stripping steam is passed from the lower stripping zone (48)
to the upper stripping zone (50) through a passage (74)

through the liquid collector (72).
