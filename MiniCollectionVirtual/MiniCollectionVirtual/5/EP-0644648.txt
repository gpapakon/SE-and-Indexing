<ABSTRACT>
A control method and apparatus for an AC motor (6) are described in which a voltage drop 
across the primary of the motor is estimated by using an estimated resistance value R₁
#
, 
estimated by an integral or proportional plus integral operation on the deviation between a 

detected magnetizing current value I
M
 and a reference magnetizing current value I
M
*, in place 
of an actual primary resistance value R₁. The time for the estimated resistance value R₁
#
 to 
reach the true primary resistance value is reduced by means of a varying reference magnetizing 

current value I
M
**. Variations of the estimated primary resistance values R₁
#
s between the 
phases are corrected by calculating a mean estimated primary resistance value R
1M
#
 according 
to a reference phase value *. Malfunctions such as open phase and breaking of wire are 

detected by comparing estimated primary resistance values obtained according to the reference 
phase value *.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a control method and apparatus for an AC motor that detects a 
primary resistance of the AC motor with excellent accuracy and to a malfunction detection 
method and apparatus that detects a malfunction by comparing estimated primary resistance 
values of each phase. Magnetic flux and torque of an AC motor can be controlled by resolving a current flowing 
through the AC motor into a magnetizing current component parallel to the magnetic flux and a 
torque current component perpendicular to the magnetic flux, and by controlling the 
magnetizing current and the torque current components independently. It is well known that the 
speed of the AC motor can be controlled highly accurately by the so-called transvector control 
method that treats the current of the AC motor as a vector consisting of two components. Since, in the transvector control of the AC motor, the AC motor is controlled by using an 
equivalent circuit of the AC motor as a control model, control constants based on the 
equivalent circuit constants are pre-set to a control apparatus. Usually, designed values of the 
motor constants are used as these control constants. However, there are differences between 
the designed and actual values of the motor constants and the differences cause control errors. 
Variations of the motor constants during driving the motor also cause control errors. 
Furthermore, the transvector control method can not be applied when the constants of the 
motor already in service are unknown. In the transvector control, it is necessary to detect the induced electromotive force which 
relates to the magnetic flux. The induced electromotive force is calculated by subtracting the 
voltage drop across the internal impedance of the motor from the terminal voltage of the motor. 
The voltage drop across the internal impedance of the motor is obtained by multiplying the 
magnetizing current component and a primary resistance value of the motor. Generated torque 
becomes insufficient especially when the motor is driven at low speed, because an appropriate 
output reference voltage value can not be calculated when the primary resistance value is 
different from the pre-set value. To solve this problem, a method has been proposed that 
obtains the primary resistance value by dividing an output voltage by a phase current of 
predetermined value which is made to flow through the motor (See RM-85-26, Technical 
Meeting Paper on Rotating Machine, p. 65, Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan). The
