Two vehicles connected together by a communication passage, 
especially with a bellows, wherein the communication passage has an 

inner lining which comprises a side wall covering in the form of an 
inherently resiliently flexible plate constructed to be convex about 

the vertical axis of plane in the direction of the centre of the 
communication passage, characterised thereby that the side wall 

covering (3) is supported fixedly or pivotably or through resiliently 
flexible connecting means (4) by each of the two vehicles. 
Two vehicles connected together according to claim 1, 
characterised thereby that the flexible connecting means (4) 

comprises a hinge (5). 
Two vehicles connected together according to claim 2, 
characterised thereby that the hinge is a spring hinge (5). 
Two vehicles connected together according to claim 2, 
characterised thereby that the flexible connecting means (4) 

comprises a resilient element (6) that connects the hinge (5) with 
the side wall covering (3). 
Two vehicles connected together according to claim 4, 
characterised thereby that the resilient element (6) is constructed 

as walling. 
Two vehicles connected together according to claim 3, 
characterised thereby that the spring hinge (5) is prestressed in 

such a manner that the side wall covering (3) is drawn in the 
direction of the respective carriage body (1, 2). 
Two vehicles connected together according to claim 4, 
characterised thereby that the hinge (5) is arranged near the side 

wall covering (3), and the articulation of the hinge (5) at the 
resilient element (6) is effected approximately parallel to a line 

parallel to the communication passage longitudinal axis, so that the  
 

resilient element (6) at its end extends at an angle relative to the 
communication passage longitudinal axis. 
Two vehicles connected together according to claim 3, 
characterised thereby that an abutment (11) for the spring hinge (5) 

to limit the pivot angle is provided in the region of the 
articulation of the spring hinge (5). 
Two vehicles connected together according to claim 7, 
characterised thereby that the hinge (5) has a strap (5a), which 

carries a mount (7) to which the resilient element (6) is 
articulated. 
Two vehicles connected together according to claim 9, 
characterised thereby that the mount has a radius (7a), wherein the 

resilient element (6) bears on the radius (7a). 
Two vehicles connected together according to claim 10, 
characterised thereby that a gap cover (15) is provided between 

carriage bodies (1, 2) and connecting means (4), wherein the gap 
cover (15) is arranged at the carriage bodies (1, 2). 
Two vehicles connected together according to claim 4, 
characterised thereby that the resilient element (6) has a cover (14) 

to conceal the space around the spring hinge (5) when the hinge (5) 
is pivoted. 
Two vehicles connected together according to claim 1, comprising 
a roof cover, characterised by individual sheet segments which form 

the roof cover (16) and which are carried by a mount (21), preferably 
however two mounts (21), to be movable relative to one another in the 

direction of the longitudinal axis of the mount (21). 
Two vehicles connected together according to claim 13, 
characterised thereby that the sheet segments (18, 19, 20) extend 

transversely to the vehicle longitudinal axis and are carried by two 
mounts (21) connecting the two carriage bodies.  

 
Two vehicles connected together according to claim 13, 
characterised thereby that the mount (21) comprises a spring 

telescope (28), preferably however two spring telescopes (28), 
wherein the two spring telescopes (28) stand in connection with one 

another by an intermediate element (25). 
Two vehicles connected together according to claim 15, 
characterised thereby that the spring telescope (28) comprises an 

equaliser sleeve (37), which possesses fastening means (26) for 
reception of a sheet segment (18, 20). 
Two vehicles connected together according to claim 16, 
characterised thereby that the equaliser sleeve (37) is held in 

axial direction by equaliser springs (38, 39) to be axially movable 
in its initial position, wherein the equaliser springs are mounted by 

the spring telescope (28). 
Two vehicles connected together according to claim 15, 
characterised thereby that the spring telescope (28) comprises a 

guide sleeve (29) and a telescope sleeve (30), wherein the two 
sleeves (29, 30) are mounted one in the other to be movable relative 

to one another against the force of a telescope spring (35). 
Two vehicles connected together according to claim 18, 
characterised thereby that the two sleeves (19, 20) stand in 

connection with one another by a guide bush (31). 
Two vehicles connected together according to claim 16, 
characterised thereby that the spring telescope has a bearing sleeve 

(36), which carries the equaliser springs (37) to be axially movable. 
Two vehicles connected together according to claim 15, 
characterised thereby that the intermediate element (25) has 

fastening means (26) for reception of a sheet segment (19). 
Two vehicles connected together according to claim 21 and 
according to claim 14, characterised thereby that the sheet segment  

 
(18, 19, 20) is connected with the mount (21) by the fastening means 

(26) displaceably in the direction of the longitudinal axis of the 
sheet segment (18, 19, 20). 
Two vehicles connected together according to claim 22, 
characterised thereby that the fastening means comprises at least one 

vertically oriented U-shaped guide shoe (26), preferably however two 
mutually opposite such guide shoes (26), wherein the sheet segment 

(18, 19, 20) has a vertical web (23) with a horiziontally directed U-shaped 
recess (24), wherein the guide shoes (26) engage in the limbs 

(23a, 23b) of the U-shaped recess (24). 
Two vehicles connected together according to claim 23, 
characterised thereby that the guide shoes (26) are connected with 

the web (23) by return springs (27). 
Two vehicles connected together according to claim 13,

respective carriage body (1, 2) to be pivotable in all three 
dimensional directions. 
Two vehicles connected together according to claim 17, 
characterised thereby that the intermediate element (25), the 

equaliser sleeve (37) and the bearing sleeve (36) each have one or 
two spring mountings (36a, 37a, 37b, 25b) for the equaliser springs 

(38,39).
