<DESCRIPTION>
 HEPATITIS C VIRUS PEPTIDESThis invention relates to a novel peptide capable of binding to antibody specific for parenterally transmitted non A non B hepatitis (PT-NANBH) in particular (HCV) and the use of such a peptide in an im unoassay for the detection of HCV or a vaccine for its prevention.Non A non B hepatitis (NANBH) is by definition a diagnosis of exclusion and has generally been employed to describe cases of viral hepatitis infection in human beings that are not due to hepatitis A or B viruses. The PT-NANBH virus has also been referred to as Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) . In the majority of such cases, the cause of the infection has not been identified although, on clinical and epidemiological grounds, a number of agents have been thought to be responsible as reviewed in Shih et aJL (Prog Liver Pis. , 1986, 8., 433-452). In the USA alone, up to 10% of blood transfusions can. result in NANBH which makes it a significant problem.GB-A-2 239 245 discloses nucleotide and polypeptide sequences of a viral agent responsible for Post Transfusional NANBH (PT-NANBH) , the core region of this viral agent responsible for PT-NANBH is disclosed within the nucleotide and peptide sequences. The core region of the disclosed viral agent responsible for PT-NANBH was not analysed in GB-A-2 239 245. Substantial portions of the core region were used in reco binant polypeptides namely BHC-11 as disclosed in GB-A-2 239 245.Substantial regions of the core region of the viral agent responsible for PT-NANBH disclosed in'GB-A-2239245, were also used to detect HCV infection in British Application No. 9203803.3 filed in the name of Wellcome Foundation Limited on February 21, 1992.EP-A-0 445 423 discloses an assay for detecting the 

presence of an antibody to an HCV antigen by contacting the sample with a polypeptide containing at least one epitope of an HCV antigen. A polypeptide from the putative core region of HCV is used. Specific epitopic regions of the polypeptides are not identified.It has surprisingly been found by the present inventors that several domains within the N-terminal region of the HCV core protein are epitopic. It has also surprisingly been found that of the sera reactive with N-terminal region of the core protein the majority react with a single domain exclusively or in combination with any of the other epitopic domains. This single domain has been termed the i munodominant epitope. This immunodo inant epitope has been isolated by the present inventors.Accordingly, the present invention provides a HCV viral
