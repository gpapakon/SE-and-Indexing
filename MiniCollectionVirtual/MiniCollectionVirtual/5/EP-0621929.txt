<ABSTRACT>
A brake adjuster in the form of a strut assembly having a first end strut (31) for engagement with a first part (17) of an associated brake and slideably engaging with a nut member (29) which is screw threadedly connected to a second end strut (35) for engagement with a second part (18) of the associated brake. A leaf spring (50) extends between the first end strut (31) and the nut member (29) to bias them apart, the leaf spring having a pawl (55) which is engageable with a ratchet (42) on the nut member (29) to rotate the nut number to increase the overall length of the strut assembly and hence adjust brake clearance when the leaf spring (50) moves towards a relaxed condition. The leaf spring (50) has a hole (51, 52) at both ends for engaging lugs (122, 94) on the first strut (31) and the nut member (29), the spring including an integral sprag (54) adjacent each hole for engaging the respective lug (122, 94) on the first strut and nut member to support and locate the spring.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to automatic brake 
adjusters. In drum brakes typically a strut is interposed 
between the brake shoes to limit return movement of 
the brake shoes upon release of the brakes. 
Automatic adjustment means may be incorporated in 
the strut to adjust the length of the strut to take 
account of wear of the friction linings of the 
brake shoes and maintain the clearance between the 
friction linings and the brake drums within a 
predetermined range. One method of adjusting the length of the strut is 
to include a screw mechanism which is operated by a 
pawl and ratchet mechanism, in response to relative 
movement of the brake shoes upon hydraulic brake 
actuation. Hitherto, the pawl mechanism of such 
adjusters has been pivotally mounted between one of 
the shoes and the strut, so that the pawl can follow 
movement of the shoe relative to strut which 
would be located with respect to the other shoe, 
these pawl mechanisms require one or more spring 
elements to maintain them in engagement with the  
 
shoe and ratchet wheel. Such mechanisms must be 
located in the confined space between the brake 
shoes and the wheel hub which imposes limitations 
on their design which will adversely affect their 
operation. Furthermore, such pawl mechanisms can 
easily become clogged with debris resulting from 
wear of the friction linings. British patent 1,287,884 discloses an adjustment 
mechanism in which the strut includes a screw adjuster 
in which two parts of the strut move apart 
upon hydraulic operation of the brake. A leaf 
spring is attached between the two parts of the 
strut so that it is bowed when the strut is under 
tension. The spring has a pawl formation which engages 
a ratchet wheel, so that when the brake shoes 
move apart upon hydraulic brake actuation, the 
spring will force the two parts of the strut apart 
and in so doing will flatten causing the pawl formation 
to rotate the ratchet wheel which in turn 
rotates the screw adjuster to lengthen the strut. 
This arrangement overcomes many of the problems encountered 
hitherto. However, for accurate operation, 
the leaf spring must be located positively 
with respect to the two parts of the strut, so that 
it is secured with respect thereto, axially, 
rotationally and radially. While in the adjuster  
 
disclosed in British patent 1,287,884, axial location of 
the leaf spring is adequate, rotational and radial 
location are poor. In EP 338057A, the present Applicant discloses a leaf 
spring with improved rotational and

A brake adjuster comprising a strut assembly 
in the form of a first end strut (31) for 

engagement with a first part (17) of an 
associated brake and slideably engaging with 

a nut member (29) which is screw threadedly 
connected to a second end strut (35) for 

engagement with a second part (18) of the 
associated brake, a leaf spring (50) 

operatively connected between the first end 
strut (31) and the nut member (29) to bias 

them apart, the leaf spring having a pawl 
(55) thereon which is engageable with a 

ratchet wheel (42) on the nut member (29) to 
effect rotation of the nut member relative to 

the second strut member (35) to increase the 
overall length of the strut assembly and hence 

adjust brake clearance when the leaf spring 
(50) moves towards a relaxed condition, 

wherein the leaf spring (50) has a hole 
(51,52) at both ends thereof for engaging lugs 

(122,94) operatively connected with the first 
strut (31) and the nut member (29), 

characterised in that the spring includes an 
integral sprag (54) adjacent each hole for 

engaging the respective lug (122,94) 
operatively connected with the first strut and 

nut member.  
 
A brake adjuster as claimed in Claim 1 wherein 
each sprag (54) is on the axially outer edge 

of each hole (51,52) for engaging each lug 
(122,94). 
A brake adjuster as claimed in Claim 1 or 
Claim 2 wherein each sprag (54) engages in an 

aperture 91a, 122a in each lug (94,122). 
A brake adjuster as claimed in any one of 
Claims 1 to 3 wherein the end portions of the 

leaf spring (50) are enlarged so that the 
width of spring material encompassing each 

hole (51,52) is of substantially equal width

lock device (95) is provided on either the nut 
member (29) or the first end strut (31) for

axial separation thereof when the temperature 

of the associated brake exceeds a 
predetermined value.

claim 7 wherein the first end strut has its
