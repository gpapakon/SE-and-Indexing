<ABSTRACT>
An I.V. catheter is described, including a catheter 
and hub assembly (15, 16, 18) and a needle and hub assembly (12, 20). 

A needle guard (30), including a tubular distal portion (32) and a 
split proximal flange (34), is located about the needle (12) at the 

distal end of the needle hub (20). The needle (12) includes a slot (50) 
near the needle tip. As the needle assembly (12, 20) is withdrawn from 

the catheter (15), the needle guard (30) slides along the needle (12) 
until the split flange (34) engages the needle slot (50), which 

locks the tubular distal portion (32) of the guard (30) over the 
needle tip.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to intravenous (I.V.) catheters 
and, in particular, to I.V. catheters which cover the 
cannula tip after use to prevent accidental injury from 
used needles. Intravenous catheters for the infusion of fluids 
into the peripheral veins of a patient are one of the 
most common devices used in I.V. therapy. I.V. catheters 
may be produced in two general forms: through-the-needle 
catheters, in which a catheter is threaded 
through the needle cannula and into the vein of a patient, 
and over-the-needle catheters, in which the needle 
and concentric outer catheter are inserted into the 
vein and the needle is withdrawn through the emplaced 
catheter. A typical over-the-needle I.V. catheter requires 
the user to remove and then dispose of a contaminated 
needle after the needle tip and catheter are properly 
located in the vein of the patient. Once the needle 
is withdrawn from the catheter, the user's immediate 
priorities are infusion set connection and site preparation, 
including the taping of the catheter to the patient. 
Because of the urgency of these procedures, the 
needle is normally just dropped conveniently nearby 
and then retrieved later. Since the needle at this time 
is exposed and located close to where the user is 
completing work with the catheter, accidental self-inflicted 
needle injuries are not uncommon. For reasons 
of the desirability of protecting the user from exposure 
to hepatitis and AIDS, there is an increasing 
need to protect the user from accidental needle injury. A catheter design which is directed toward this 
need is shown in United States patent no.4762516. 
The catheter shown in this application includes an 
elongate body which houses a sliding needle guard. 
As the needle is withdrawn from the emplaced catheter, 
the user pushes the tab at the distal end of the 
needle guard, thereby sliding the needle guard out of 
the housing and along the needle, until the distal end 
of the guard covers the needle tip and the proximal 
end of the guard locks in the housing. The needle and 
guard may then be set aside with the needle tip fully 
protected. While the arrangement described in this patent 
application provides full protection against accidental 
needle injury, the requirement of a sliding needle 
guard which exceeds the length of the needle necessarily 
requires a rather long and bulky assembly. 
Moreover, since the user must push the guard tab 
along the full length of the needle before the guard will 
lock in place over the needle tip, the

<CLAIMS>
An intravenous (I.V.) catheter comprising:
 
   a catheter assembly including a catheter 

(10) attached to a hollow catheter hub (16, 18); 
and
 
   an introducer needle assembly, including a 

hollow needle (12) with a distal tip, said needle 
being affixed near its proximal end to a needle 

hub (20), the distal end of said needle hub being 
suitable for engaging said hollow catheter hub;
 
   characterised in that a needle guard (30) 

is provided, and in that
 
   said needle includes means (50) for engaging 

said needle guard (30), said needle guard 
(30) being suitable for confinement within said 

hollow catheter hub (18) and including a proximal 
portion having means (34) for engaging said engaging 

means (50) of said needle and a distal 
portion (32) for extending over said needle tip 

when said proximal portion (34) is engaged with 
said engaging means (50) of said needle.  

 
The I.V. catheter of Claim 1, wherein said engaging 
means of said needle comprises an engagement 

slot (50) located near said distal tip of said 
needle. 
The I.V. catheter of Claim 1 or Claim 2, wherein 
said distal portion (32) of said needle guard (30) 

comprises a cylindrical portion having an inner diameter 
slightly larger than the outer diameter of 

said needle. 
The I.V. catheter of Claim 3, wherein said proximal 
portion of said needle guard comprises a 

flange (34) having a central aperture (36) aligned 
with said distal cylindrical portion (32), and said 

needle guard engaging means includes an axially 
aligned expansion slot (38) passing through said 

flange.  
 
The I.V. catheter of Claim 4, wherein said needle 
guard (30) becomes locked in engagement with 

said needle when the rim of said flange aperture 
(36) engages said engagement slot (50) of said 

needle. 
The I.V. catheter of Claim 4 or Claim 5, wherein 
the diameter of said flange aperture (36) is less 

than the outer diameter of said needle,
 
   whereby said needle spreads said flange 

(34) about said expansion slot when the full diameter 
of said needle passes through said flange 

aperture. 
The I.V. catheter of any one of Claims 1 to 6, 
wherein said needle guard further includes 

means for retaining said needle guard within said 
catheter hub (18) prior to engagement of said 

needle engaging means and said needle guard 
engaging means. 
The I.V. catheter of Claim 7, wherein said proximal 
portion of said needle guard comprises a radially 

extending flange (34) having a central aperture, 
and said retaining means includes an axially 

aligned expansion slot passing through said 
flange,
 
   whereby said flange is brought into contact 

(39) with said catheter hub when said expansion 
slot opens in response to the passage of said 

needle through said central aperture. 
The I.V. catheter of any one of Claims 1 to 8, in 
which the hollow needle includes a slot (50) located 

in a wall thereof for passage of blood to the region 
(54, 56, 58) between said hollow needle and 

said catheter,
 
   whereby the presence of blood may be visually 

detected between said hollow needle and 
said catheter. 
The I.V. catheter of claim 9, wherein said catheter 
is made of a transparent or translucent material. 
The I.V. catheter of any one of claims 1 to 10, in 
which the needle guard (30) is self-locking, the 

needle guard (30) being located about the needle 
(12) and initially located at the distal end (28) of 

said needle hub (20).
