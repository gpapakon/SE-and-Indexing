<ABSTRACT>
Device for detecting wear of friction linings, particularly linings of brake pads, including at least one sheathed electrically conductive wire pushed into an insulating end-fitting inserted into a hole made in a lateral wall of the lining, along an axis substantially parallel to the wear surface of the lining, and a contact piece made of a electrically conductive material and including a part forming a clamp which is crimped onto the stripped end of the electrically conductive wire. The contact piece (8) further includes a calibrated cylindrical part forming a sleeve (8b) which envelopes the electrically conductive wire (4) over its sheathed part (6), the part forming a clamp (8a) and the part forming a sleeve (8b) of the contact piece (8) being electrically connected.

Device for detecting wear of brake linings, 
especially linings of brake pads, including at least one 

sheathed electrically conducting wire (4) fitted into an 
insulating ferrule (7) inserted into a hole made in a 

side wall of the lining, along an axis substantially 
parallel to the wear surface of the lining, and characterized 

by a contact piece (8) made of an electrically 
conducting material and including a part (8a) forming a 

clamp which is crimped onto the stripped end of the 
electrically conducting wire (4), and by the fact that 

the said contact piece (8) furthermore includes a calibrated 
cylindrical part forming a sleeve (8
b
) which 
surrounds the electrically conducting wire (4) over its 

sheathed part (6), the clamp-forming part (8
a
) and the 
sleeve-forming part (8
b
) of the contact piece (8) being 
electrically connected. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized by the 
fact that the contact piece (8) is made of brass. 
Device according to either of Claims 1 and 2, 
characterized by the fact that the contact piece (8) 

results from the cutting and forming of a small metal 
plate. 
Device according to either of Claims 1 and 2, 
characterized by the fact that the contact piece (8) 

results from the machining of a hollow cylindrical metal 
piece calibrated to the desired diameter for the sleeve-forming 

part (8
b
) of the contact piece (8).
