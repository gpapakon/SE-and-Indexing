layer comprising silver halide particles substantially free of 
built-in Iridium, said silver halide particles containing more than 

95 mole% of silver chloride and having an average grain diameter of 
less than 0.27 µ and (ii) an image receiving layer containing 

physical development nuclei and 
developing said imaging element using an alkaline processing 
liquid in the presence of developing agent (s) and a meso-ionic 

compound.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for obtaining a 
lithographic printing plate with a silver halide photographic 
material sensitive to high intensity-short time exposure according 
to the silver salt diffusion transfer process. With recent rapid progress of information transmitting systems, 
silver halide photographic light sensitive materials have been 
increasingly required to have high sensitivity. Such systems are, 
for example, high speed phototypesetting systems according to which 
information output from an electronic computer is immediately 
displayed as letters or figures by a cathode ray tube and press 
facsimile systems for rapid transmission of newspaper originals to a 
remote place. Todate on the market phototypesetters usually work with a He/Ne 
laser (632nm), laser diode (680nm) or LED (670nm or 780nm). 
Especially phototypesetters that operate with a He/Ne laser or LED 
are frequently employed, but also argon lasers (488 nm) are still in 
use. For a photographic material to be suitable for use in 
phototypesetting applications it is required that the material is of 
high speed to so-called high intensity-short time exposure (flash 
exposure or scanning exposure), namely exposure for 10⁻⁴ second or 
less and yields images of high contrast and high resolving power. Photographic phototypesetting materials include photographic 
films and papers used in a process for preparing a lithographic 
printing plate and silver salt diffusion transfer based (hereinafter 
called DTR-) lithographic printing plates disclosed in e.g. 
US-P-4,501,811 and US-P-4,784,933. With the latter materials a 
lithographic printing plate is immediately obtained without the need 
of a contact exposure or camera exposure. A photographic DTR material preferably comprises a silver halide 
emulsion mainly consisting of silver chloride in order to obtain a 
sufficiently high rate of solution of the silver halide and a 
satisfactory gradation necessary for graphic purposes. Only a small  
 
amount of silver bromide and/or silver iodide usually not exceeding 
5 mole % is present. However when using high intensity-short time 
exposure units the printing properties of a lithographic plate 
produced from DTR materials using conventional silver chloride 
emulsions are deteriorated e.g. more stain and lower printing 
endurance as disclosed in US-P-5,059,508. So, in order to obtain DTR materials which can be used for high 
intensity-short time exposure and which will give good lithographic 
printing plates it is taught to
