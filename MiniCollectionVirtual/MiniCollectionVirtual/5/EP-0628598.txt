composition comprising, as main components, a block 

copolymer having styrene-type hydrocarbon blocks and 
conjugated diene-type hydrocarbon blocks, and a polymer 

containing a styrene-type hydrocarbon, wherein the 
conjugated diene-type blocks in the block copolymer 

constitute from 5 to 40 wt% of the entire composition.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a heat-shrinkable
polystyrene tube excellent in covering processability,
which is useful mainly for covering dry cells.As a heat-shrinkable tube for dry cells, the one made
of polyvinyl chloride is well known. However, polyvinyl
chloride has an environmental problem such that when
incinerated, it produces hydrogen chloride. Accordingly,
in recent years, a heat-shrinkable tube made of a
material containing no halogen element, has been desired.As a candidate for such a material, a styrene-butadiene
type block copolymer may be mentioned, since it
is practically used in the field of shrinkable films. In
general, a styrene-type polymer has strong nerviness, but
it is poor in the impact resistance and has drawbacks
that when bent, it is likely to undergo cracking or
whitening. Therefore, it is not practically useful for a
seamless tube. Whereas, by increasing the butadiene
content of such a styrene-butadiene type block copolymer,
it is possible to obtain a tube having high impact 
resistance.However, with a tube made of such a styrene-butadiene
type block copolymer, if it is attempted to improve the
impact resistance or to overcome whitening on bending,
the nerviness tends to be poor, whereby it will be
difficult to cover it on dry cells by a high speed
automatic covering apparatus.Further, it is usually necessary to set the
stretching temperature at a high level to produce a tube
from a styrene-butadiene type block copolymer.
Accordingly, the temperature for shrinkage tends to be
high, such being undesirable to use the tube for covering
dry cells.As a technique to provide a tube shrinkable at a low
temperature by overcoming such a problem, a method has
been developed wherein a styrene-butadiene type block
copolymer having a molecular weight within a certain
specific range or a certain specific molecular weight
distribution, or a styrene-butadiene type block copolymer
having a special block structure, is used.However, the tube shrinkable at a low temperature
produced by such a method undergoes so-called natural
shrinkage i.e. shrinkage during the storage at room
temperature after stretching of the tube. Accordingly,
the low temperature shrinkable tube is poor in flatness
or dimensional stability, and its performance has not
been satisfactory. Further, a tube is usually wound up in a flattened
state, and when it is to be used, it is cut into a
predetermined length, whereupon it will be opened, so
that it will be put on e.g. a dry cell in the opened
state. However, the tube made
