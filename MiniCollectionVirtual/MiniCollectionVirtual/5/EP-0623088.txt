<ABSTRACT>
A belt transfer section (30) for use in a right angle carton blank feeder. The belt transfer section (30) nips the leading edge of articles (8) leaving a feeding mechanism (12) and moves them to another feeding mechanism (24) operating at right angles to the first mechanism. The belt transfer section (30) moves the articles (8) along a diagonal path connecting the paths of movement on the other feeding mechanisms (12, 24). Articles (8) are moved by the belt transfer section (30) at a speed greater than the speeds of the other feeding mechanisms (12, 24) according to the ratio of the length of the diagonal path, considered as the hypotenuse of an imaginary right triangle, to the other legs of the triangle.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of continuously
moving a stream of articles along an angled path
according to the preamble of claim 1, which method may
for example be encountered in a right angle gluer for
carton blanks.In fabricating cartons from flat carton blanks, a
stream of blanks is commonly fed into a forming machine
along a first path and glue is applied from glue
applicators to edge portions of the blanks that are
parallel to the direction of movement. The blanks are
then moved along a second path at right angles to the
first path and glue is applied from glue applicators to
edge portions of the blanks that extend transversely of
the first path and are now parallel to the new direction
of movement. All the portions of the blanks to be glued
are thus exposed to glue applicators.A conventional way of changing the direction of
movement of the blanks involves the use of speed-up rolls
at the end of the first path of movement. The first feed
means delivers the blanks to the speed-up rolls which
accelerate them to a pocket. Moving chain lugs engage the
blanks in the pocket and deliver them to the second feed
means in order to move the blanks at right angles to
their first direction of movement.One of the problems noted with this conventional
method of transferring blanks is that the speed-up rolls
tend to wear faster than the other feeding elements,
requiring expensive periodic replacement. Another problem
is that the number of blanks which the machine is capable
of handling per unit of time is limited by the rate at
which the transfer section can transfer blanks from the
first feed path to the second feed path. Because
presently available transfer sections are relatively
slow, it would be very beneficial to be able to transfer
blanks from one path of movement to the other at a faster
rate. It would also be desirable to be able to employ a 
transfer mechanism which does not utilize speed-up rolls,
thus eliminating the problem of excessive maintenance.DE-A-2743816 discloses a method of the generic type
of continuously moving a stream of articles along an
angled path; in particular it discloses a belt conveyor
for feeding articles along an right-angled path with a
transverse section for transferring articles from one leg
of the right-angled path to the other leg in a vertical
plane. The transverse section is comprised of flat belt
conveyors on one side and a number of round belts on the
other side.The prior art method suffers from insufficient
stability of movement of the articles along the third
mov

<CLAIMS>
A method of continuously moving a stream of
articles (B) along an angled path, comprising:


moving a stream of equally spaced articles (B) in
a first horizontal direction at a constant speed

by a first moving means (12);
moving said stream at said constant speed in a
second horizontal direction at an angle to the

first direction by a second moving means (22,. 24)
spaced from the first moving means (12);
transferring the articles from the first moving
means (12) to the second moving means (22, 24) by

moving the articles in a third intermediate
direction directly from a point of exit on the

first moving means (12) to a point of entrance on
the second moving means (22, 24) by means of

third moving means (30) comprising two parallel
belt assemblies (32, 34), a first one (32) being

outwardly spaced from the second belt assembly
(34);
the articles (B) being moved in the third
intermediate direction at a speed greater than

said constant speed by an amount such that the
spacing between the articles (B) in the stream of

articles moved by the first moving means (22, 24)
is maintained in the stream of articles moved by

the third moving means;

characterized by the fact that:

said one of the belt assemblies (32) of said
third moving means (30) engages the front edge of

an article (B) exiting the first moving means
(12) shortly before the other belt assembly (34)

engages the top edge of said article (B). 
A method according to claim 1,

characterized in that the first (12) and second
(22, 24) article moving means are spaced apart so

that only a single article is moved by a third
article moving means (30) at any one time.
A method according to claim 1 or 2,

characterized in that the first and second
horizontal directions are at right angles to each

other and the articles (B) are transferred by the
third moving means (30) at a speed which is

related to the speed of the first (12) and second
(22, 24) article moving means in accordance with

the equation z = the square root of the sum of x
2

+ y
2
, where x is one leg of a right triangle
equal to the distance from the point of exit on

the first moving means (12) to the point at which
an extension of the original path of movement of

an article (B) moved by the first moving means
(12) intersects an extension of the point of

entrance of the path of movement of an article
moved by the second moving means (22, 24), y is a

second leg of the right triangle equal to the
distance from the point of entrance of the second

moving means (22, 24) to the aforesaid
intersection point and z is the hypotenuse of the

right triangle, the ratio of the speeds of the
third to the first article moving means being

approximately the ratio of Z to X.
A method of continuously moving a stream of
articles according to claim 3, wherein the angle

between the hypotenuse and the legs of the right
triangle is 45Â°. 
A method according to claims 1 to 4,

characterized in that the articles (B) contact a
side stop (28) for stopping their transverse

movement as the articles exit the third moving
means (30).
A method according to the claims 1 to 5,

characterized in that the articles (B) exiting
the third moving means (30) are engaged at their

trailing edges by spaced continuously moving lugs
(22) of a first section of the second article

moving means (22, 24).
