<ABSTRACT>
Plastic parts produced from thermoplastic moulding materials by injection moulding are subjected to the following steps:     - Plasma etching in an oxidising atmosphere; - Plasma treatment in a noble-gas atmosphere, in particular argon atmosphere; - Metallisation by sputtering in a noble-gas atmosphere, especially argon atmosphere.   Conductive tracks can be formed on the plastic parts metallised in this way by the subtractive technique or semi-additive technique. An adhesion of the metallisation, determined using the peeling test, of at least 1 N/mm is achieved. The wet chemical pretreatment and chemical copper plating of the plastic parts which were hitherto required are obviated.

<CLAIMS>
Process for the production of three-dimensional
plastic parts with integrated conductive tracks, having

the following steps:

a) Producing the plastic parts from thermoplastic
moulding compositions by injection moulding,
b) Plasma-etching the plastic parts in an oxidizing
atmosphere;
c) Plasma treatment of the plastic parts in a
noble-gas atmosphere;
d) Metallizing the plastic parts by sputtering in
a noble-gas atmosphere;
e) Forming conductive tracks on the plastic parts
using a subtractive technique or semi-additive technique.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that, in order to dehydrate them, the plastic parts are

subjected to a heat-treatment before the plasma etching.
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that the plasma etching of the plastic parts is

carried out in an oxygen atmosphere.
Process according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the plasma treatment is carried out

in an argon atmosphere.
Process according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the sputtering is carried out in an

argon atmosphere.
Process according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that, during the sputtering, copper is

deposited on the plastic parts.
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that, during the sputtering, a layer

sequence of titanium and copper is deposited on the
plastic parts.
