<ABSTRACT>
A pipe fitting or coupling is used for connecting at 
least two pipes. The pipe fitting is basically formed of a 

coupling main body (2) and a slit ring (5) integrally formed 
together. The coupling main body is formed of an inner layer (21) 

of good heat resisting property, an intermediate layer (22) 
containing glass fibers, and an outer layer (23) having large 

tensile elongation and impact strength. The slit ring is 
formed at an edge portion of the outer circumferential 

surface of the coupling main body.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pipe fitting or
coupling for connecting pipes, such as water supply
pipes, hot-water supply pipes and the like.As a prior art, a pipe fitting or coupling for
connecting pipes, such as water supply pipes and hot-water
supply pipes, is formed of a cylindrical coupling
main body and a slit ring provided on an outer
circumferential surface of an edge portion of the
coupling main body. The edge portion of the coupling
main body is inserted into an interior of an edge portion
of a pipe to be connected, and a nut, such as a cap nut,
is screwed onto a screw portion provided on the slit ring
to be tightened, thereby to hold and fix the edge portion
of the pipe with the coupling main body and the slit
ring.For example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication
(KOKAI) No. 4-262189, on which the preamble of claim 1 is
based, discloses a pipe coupling formed of an inner layer
for constituting an inner circumferential surface of a
coupling main body, an outer layer for constituting an
outer circumference surface of the coupling main body,
and a slit ring. The inner layer is made of a
thermoplastic resin having a heat distortion temperature
of 95Â°C or higher, such as polyether ether ketone, crosslinking
polyethylene and polyphenylene sulfide. The
outer layer includes a screw portion on one edge thereof
and is 
made of a thermoplastic resin having a screw torque strength
of 300 kg/cm2 or higher, such as polyether imide,
polyphenylene sulfide and polyether sulfone. The slit ring
is made of a thermoplastic resin, such as nylon and
polyethylene having ductility, so that when a nut is screwed
onto the slit ring, the diameter of the slit ring is
contracted. The inner layer and the outer layer of the
coupling main body, and the slit ring are integrally formed.However, the pipe coupling disclosed in the above
publication is short of shear strength in the screw portion
formed on the edge portion of the outer layer or a tip
portion of the slit ring of the coupling main body, so that a
thermoplastic resin to which reinforcing glass fibers are
added has been often used.Although a modulus of shear elasticity, i.e. shear
strength in the screw portion, is improved by the
thermoplastic resin containing the glass fibers, impact
strength is decreased. Therefore, when pipes are connected,
if a pipe coupling is dropped, or tools fall down onto the
pipe coupling, the pipe coupling may crack or break. Also,
depending on a installation condition of a pipe coupling, the
pipe coupling is stepped on by people or
