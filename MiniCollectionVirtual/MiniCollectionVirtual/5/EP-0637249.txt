<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to formulations
for suppressing lymphocyte proliferation and controlling
the immune response of mammals against the introduction of
foreign tissue. The invention also relates to the use of a Class II antigen or
a synthetic peptide corresponding to a fragment of a Class II antigen for suppressing
lymphocyte proliferation and controlling the immune response of mammals against the
introduction of foreign tissue, and thereby prolonging the survival of
transplanted organs and tissues.Recent work with synthetic peptides representing
portions of the polymorphic regions of mouse and human Class I
and II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules indicates
that they can be bound to MHC molecules and elicit a T cell
response in vitro (Benichou, G., et al. (1990) J. Exp. Med. 172:
1341-1346; Nuchtern, J.G., et al. (1990) Nature 343: 74-76;
Olson, C.A., et al. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86: 1031-1035;
Parham, P., et al. (1987) Nature 325: 625-628; and Chen,
B.P., et al. (1991), J. EXP. Med. 172: 779-788). There is no
information on the induction of immunity or tolerance by
administration of synthetic MHC peptides in vivo. The oral route
of administration of antigens has been shown to induce immune
hyporesponsiveness (Mowat, A. (1987) Immunology Today 8: 93-98).It has been disclosed that oral
administration of allogeneic splenocytes to inbred rats down-regulates
the systemic cell mediated immune response in vitro and
in vivo. The amino acid sequences of the RT1Bβ- and RT1.Dβ-MHC Class II proteins
in diabetes-prone and resistant rat have been disclosed by Chao et al. (Immunogenetics,
vol. 29, pages 231-234, 1989).According to the invention a composition for treatment of a mammal is
provided, which comprises at least one member selected from the group consisting of: 
(i) major histocompatibility complex Class II antigen from a nonself mammal or from tissue
of a mammal syngeneic to said nonself mammal; (ii) at least one synthetic peptide
corresponding to a fragment of said Class II antigen and having the property of suppressing
the ability of T-cells from a mammal to proliferate in response to stimulation by nonself
mammalian tissue. In a preferred embodiment, the synthetic peptide has at least 13 amino
acids.In a further embodiment, the composition according to the invention is for
suppressing immune response which leads to allograft rejection in a mammal receiving an
allograft from a donor nonself mammal. The composition can be administered orally,
enterally or

leads to allograft rejection in a mammal receiving an allograft from a donor nonself

mammal.
The composition according to any of claims 1 to 3 for oral, enteral or intrathymic

administration.
Use of at least one member selected from the group consisting of (1) major
histocompatibility complex Class II antigen from a nonself mammal or from a

tissue of a mammal syngeneic to said nonself mammal; (2) at least one synthetic
peptide corresponding to a fragment of said Class II antigen for the preparation of

a medicament for treating a disease requiring suppressing the ability of T-cells
from a mammal to proliferate in response to stimulation by nonself mammalian

tissue, wherein said medicament is suitable for oral, enteral or intrathymic 
administration.
Use of at least one member selected from the group consisting of (1) a Class II
major histocompatibility complex antigen from a donor mammal or from a

mammal syngeneic to the donor mammal and (2) a synthetic peptide
corresponding to a fragment of said Class II for the preparation of a medicament

for treating a disease requiring suppressing an immune response which leads to
allograft rejection in a mammal receiving an allograft from said donor mammal,

said medicament being suitable for oral, enteral or intrathymic administration.
