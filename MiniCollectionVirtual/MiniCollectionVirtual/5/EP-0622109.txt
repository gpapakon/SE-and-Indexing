<ABSTRACT>
Deodorizing process for removing the unpleasant-smelling compounds present in or formed by a liquid formulation containing at least one compound bearing a thiol functional group, of formula:  HS-A-Y-B     (I
>
 in which:   1) the liquid formulation is placed in contact with an inert membrane which is permeable to the unpleasant-smelling compounds and impermeable to the compound(s) of formula (I); and 2) the unpleasant-smelling compounds which have passed through the membrane are placed in contact with at least one chemical substance that reacts with the said unpleasant-smelling compounds and/or with at least one physical adsorption substance which has a large specific surface for binding the said unpleasant-smelling compounds.

characterized in that: 


1) the liquid formulation is placed in contact with an 
inert membrane which is permeable to the malodorous 

compounds and impermeable to the compound(s) of 
formula (I); and 
2) the malodorous compounds which have passed through the 
membrane are placed in contact with at least one 

physical adsorption substance having a large specific 
surface area which binds the said malodorous compounds. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the malodorous compounds which have passed through 

the membrane are placed in contact with at least one 
physical adsorption substance and with at least one 

chemical substance which reacts with the malodorous 
compounds.

characterized in that the compound of formula (I) is 

chosen from the group formed by thioglycolic acid, 
thiolactic acid, 3-mercaptopropionic acid, glycerol 

monothioglycolate, glycerol 2-mercaptopropionate, an 
azeotropic mixture of 2-hydroxypropyl thioglycolate and 

2-hydroxy-1-methylethyl thioglycolate, cysteamine and its 
N-acylated derivatives, the acyl radical containing 2 to 

5 carbon atoms, cysteine and the methyl and ethyl 
cysteinates. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the membrane material is chosen from the 

group formed by polytetrafluoroethylene, polyethylene, 
polypropylene, polystyrene and copolymers of butadiene

gels, alumina, molecular sieves, styrene-divinylbenzene 
or styrene-ethenylbenzene copolymers and polyphenylene

in finely divided form, and the aqueous solutions of 

cadmium acetate, lead acetate, copper sulphate or iron 
sulphate. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterized 
in that the membrane lines the inner face of the 

wall of the receptacle containing the formulation to be 
deodorized, the physical adsorption substance(s) intended 

to act on the malodorous compounds and the 
optionally, reacting chemical substance(s) is (are) 

arranged between the membrane and the wall of the receptacle. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterized 
in that the membrane forms at least one bag, 

which contains the physical adsorption substance(s) and, 
optionally, the reacting chemical substance(s) intended 

to act on the malodorous compounds, and in that at least 
one such bag is immersed in the liquid formulation to be 

deodorized. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterized 
in that the physical adsorption substance(s) and, 

optionally, the reacting chemical substance(s) intended 
to act on the malodorous compounds is (are) in

is coated with covering constituting the membrane, the 

coated particles being introduced into the receptacle 
containing the formulation to be deodorized. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterized 
in that the membrane, as well as the physical 

adsorption substance(s) and, optionally, the reacting 
chemical substance(s) intended to act on the malodorous 

compounds are arranged outside the receptacle containing  
 

the liquid formulation to be deodorized, and the said 
formulation and the membrane are placed in contact by 

means of a circulation device. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in

of a cap intended to cover a head of hair treated with 
the formulation which contains at least one compound of 

formula (I), the physical adsorption substance(s) and, 
optionally, the reacting chemical substance(s) being 

arranged between the said membrane and the outer face or 
the cap.
