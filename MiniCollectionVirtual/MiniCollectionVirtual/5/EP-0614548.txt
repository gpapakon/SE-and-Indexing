<CLAIMS>
Method for the automatic control of batch 
processes by means of a process control in which 

automatic control programs (1) access individual control 

modules (2), characterized in that 

a) the control instructions and parameter definitions 
contained in the automatic control programs (1) are 

stored in a separate program level (4) for the 
activation, interlocking and switch-on blocking of 

actuators (3) in the field, 
b) in this separate program level (4), the control 
instructions and parameter definitions for each actuator 

(3) to be activated are collected, actuator by actuator, 
and logically combined, and 
c) the currently effective activations, interlockings and 
switch-on blockings, and the logical combination thereof, 

are output actuator by actuator to the process operating 
and monitoring system. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the control instructions and parameterizations for 

individual or a plurality of activations and/or 
interlockings and/or switch-on blockings of one or more 

actuators (3) are stored, actuator by actuator, in the 
aforementioned program level (4). 
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the control instructions and parameterizations 

for all activations and/or interlockings and/or switch-on 
blockings of all actuators (3) activated by the process 

control are displaced into the aforementioned 
intermediate level (4). 
Method according to Claim 1, 2 or 3, 
characterized in that, for operator monitoring of the 

process control, individual, a plurality of or all the 
existing activations and/or interlockings and/or switch-on 

blockings of an actuator (3) are displayed in the 
process operating and monitoring system. 
Method according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that the activations, interlockings and/or switch-on 

blockings are displayed in the process operating and  
 

monitoring system, actuator by actuator or actuator group 
by actuator group, with display of the logical 

combinations between the statuses of the actuators (3). 
Method according to Claim 4 or 5, characterized 
in that the activations, interlockings and blockings of 

an actuator (3) in the process operating and monitoring 
system are collected to form a picture. 
Method according to Claim 4, 5 or 6, 
characterized in that these displays are complemented by 

the visual display of static operating statuses.
