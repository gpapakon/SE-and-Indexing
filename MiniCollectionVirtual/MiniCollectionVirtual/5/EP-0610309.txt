Device for collecting harmful fluid and/or granular 
substances in the-region of the rails of rail vehicles, 

with trays which are laid between the rails on the 
bedding of the track or on another support, in which a 

tray has, on its side facing the rail, a tray edge formed 
as a sealing edge which engages under the rail head, 

characterized in that the tray (1) is formed as a sealing 
edge (5) on both opposite sides disposed longitudinally 

relative to the rails, and in that for the sole fixing 
means, the tray (1) has a width such that it fits tightly 

between the rails (4) in a manner such that the sealing 
edges (5) fit closely against the rails (4) with a 

positive fit. 
Device for collecting harmful fluid and/or granular 
substances in the region of the rails of rail vehicles, 

with trays which are laid on the bedding of the track or 
on another support and which have, on their side facing 

the rail, a tray edge formed as a sealing edge which 
engages under the rail head, characterized in that, of 

the tray (1) disposed beside the pair of rails, the side 
which extends longitudinally relative to the rail and 

faces away from the rail (4) is bent upwardly, and in 
that mounting cross-pieces (15) provided transverse the 

length the rails (4) engage at least partially around the 
rail foot (9) on the side facing away from the tray, 

extend under the rail foot (9) and under the tray up to 
the edge (23) of the tray which faces away from the rail 

(4) and are connected to this edge (23) with a positive 
fit (16), the mounting cross-piece (15) being of a size, 

relative to the tray, such that the tray sits tightly in 
the mounting as sole fixing means and the sealing edge 

(5) is pressed against the rail (4) with a positive fit.  
 
Device for collecting harmful fluid and/or granular 
substances according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, characterized 

in that supports (10) are provided and are arranged 
between the under side of the sealing edge (5) and the 

upper side of the rail foot (9). 
Device for collecting harmful fluid and/or granular 
substances according to Claim 3, characterized in that 

the supports are formed as wood strips (10). 
Device for collecting harmful fluid and/or granular 
substances according to Claim 3 or Claim 4, characterized 

in that the supports (10) have a wedge-shaped cross-section. 
Device for collecting harmful fluid and/or granular 
substances according to Claim 2 and any one of Claims 3 

to 5, characterized in that, on the side on which they 
engage at least partially around the rail foot (9), the 

mounting cross-pieces (15) have an upwardly directed 
plate (17) for holding the support (10) on one side of 

the rail, and in that mounting elements (18) are provided 
on the side of the rail foot (9) which faces the tray 

(1.1), the mounting elements (18) being connected to the 
mounting cross-piece and engaging at least partially 

around the rail foot (9) and also having an upwardly 
directed plate (17) for holding the support (10) on the 

other side of the rail. 
Device for collecting harmful fluid and/or granular 
substances according to any one of Claims 1 to 6, 

characterized in that the trays (1) are of rectangular 
construction and one side (19) of the tray (1) arranged  

 
transverse the longitudinal direction of the rail is bent 

upwardly and the other is bent downwardly, the side (20) 
which is bent downwardly always lying in a horizontal 

plane lower than the side (19) which is bent upwardly and 
engaging over the upwardly bent side (19) of an adjacent 

tray (1) or projecting over the edge of a transverse 
channel (21) for the drainage of harmful substances. 
Device for collecting harmful fluid and/or granular 
subs
tances according to Claim 7, characterized in that a 
plurality of trays (1) is arranged in succession in a 

manner such that the upwardly bent sides (19) of two 
trays (1) face towards one another, and in that a cover 

(22) is provided, engaging over these two sides (19). 
Device for collecting harmful fluid and/or granular 
substances according to any one of Claims 1 to 8, 

characterized in that mounting elements (12) for bearing 
gratings (13) are arranged on the upper side of the edges 

of the trays.
