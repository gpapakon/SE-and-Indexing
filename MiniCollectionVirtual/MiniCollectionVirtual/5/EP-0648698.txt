<ABSTRACT>
In a tunnel which is kept in a high-vacuum or filled with a highly clean atmosphere, a carrying truck (3) is moved 
by an 

electromagnetic levitation system. Electromagnets (4) for electromagnetically levitate the carrying truck (3) which travels 
in the 

tunnel (1) in a noncontact way and carries semiconductor waters, electromagnets (6) constituting a linear motor for driving 
the 

carrying truck (3), and displacement sensors (8) for sensing the levitation quantity of the carrying truck (3) in the tunnel 
(1) are 

provided outside the tunnel (1). Thereby, gases are not produced and the semiconductor wafers (22) are not contaminated. 
Also, 

when the carrying truck (3) changes the traveling direction by 90Â° at a branch part where two tracks intersect at right 
angles in the 

tunnel (1), the electromagnets (4) are provided in parallel with the respective tracks and are so controlled that the 

excitation levels 
of the electromagnets (4) are changed gradually. Thereby, the traveling direction of the carrying truck (3) can be changed 

smoothly 
without contact of the truck with the inner wall of the tunnel (1) and the semiconductor wafers (22) are prevented from 

being damaged by collisions, etc.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magnetic
levitation conveyor apparatus, and more particularly to a
magnetic levitation conveyor apparatus having a carriage for
carrying a workpiece such as a wafer or the like in a tunnel
that is kept in a highly clean atmosphere such as a vacuum or
the like, the carriage being magnetically levitated for
movement out of contact with a partition.There have been growing demands in the process of
semiconductor fabrication for transferring and receiving a
wafer between various processing steps entirely in a clean
space. Since semiconductor products tend to become easily
defective when contaminated by impurities, they should
preferably be conveyed in a clean room which is highly
purified. As semiconductors are processed to smaller
dimensions, the diameter of particles which cause problems is
smaller. Therefore, it is difficult to produce desirable
purified spaces in conventional clean rooms. It has been
considered to convey a wafer or the like in a vacuum where
particles are not suspended in the space because of less
Brownian motion. Specifically, there has heretofore been
proposed a magnetic levitation conveyor apparatus having a
carriage for carrying a workpiece such as a wafer or the like 
in a vacuum maintained in a tunnel, the carriage being
magnetically levitated for movement out of contact with a
partition.There has also been proposed a magnetic levitation
conveyor apparatus having a carriage movable out of contact
with a partition of a tunnel which is filled with a clean
nitrogen gas or the like, rather than a vacuum.For example, Japanese laid-open patent publications
Nos. 61-295926 and 1-299119 disclose magnetic levitation vacuum
conveyor apparatus in which a carriage that is magnetically
levitated is movable along a conveyor passage in a partition
maintained in a highly purified vacuum environment. Japanese
laid-open patent publication No. 63-194502 and Japanese laid-open
utility model publication No. 1-134998 disclose magnetic
levitation vacuum conveyor apparatus of the type in which
members that possibly produce dirt and dust particles are
housed in the tunnel, i.e., levitating electromagnets,
displacement sensors, and linear motors which are arrayed in a
conveyor passage are housed in the tunnel (can), and a carriage
is movable in a vacuum (purified atmosphere) outside of the
tunnel (can).Japanese laid-open patent publications Nos. 53-34272,
61-277303, 4-75404, and Japanese laid-open utility model
publication No. 59-146326 disclose magnetic levitation
