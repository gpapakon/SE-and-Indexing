<ABSTRACT>
The electrical connector may include a housing,
a contact, a secondary lock, a grommet, a backplate, a

bolt, a contact removal tool, and a splash guard. The
housing includes openings which receive the contacts.

The grommets are positioned in cavities at the rear of
the housing. The housing and backplate are designed so

that the grommets are subjected to compressive forces in
order to enhance the sealing characteristic of the

grommets. As the contact is inserted, a locking tab
engages an opening in the contact and prevents the

contact from being removed from the housing. The
secondary locks will increase the retention of the

contact in the electrical connector. In addition, the
secondary lock may include a feature which permits the

partial insertion and retention of the secondary lock
prior to insertion of the contact. The secondary lock

also assures that the contacts have been properly
inserted. The electrical connector may also include a

splash guard which would assist in deflecting water from
the rear of the electrical connector. The electrical

connector may also include a removal tool which may be
used to remove contacts from the electr
ical connector.
The removal tool can be stored in the backplate or the

housing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an electrical
connector and more particularly to an electrical
connector which can be used in exterior environmental
conditions.Electrical connectors are used in exterior
environments to connect wires with various devices. The
exterior environments may include agricultural equipment,
construction equipment or other vehicles which may be
exposed to the weather, such as, moisture and temperature
extremes. In addition, such electrical connectors are
subjected to vibration from the engine or the movement of
the vehicle. Thus, the electrical connector should
withstand these operating conditions.In addition, it is necessary to attach the
electrical connector to the individual wires.
Specifically, the individual wire is attached to an
electrical contact. The electrical contact with the
attached wire is then assembled into the housing for the
electrical connector. This process may be performed by
an individual and therefore, can be relatively expensive.A general object of the present invention is to
provide an electrical connector which can withstand
environmental conditions for the particular application.
Another object of the invention is to provide an
electrical connector which reduces the manufacturing and 
assembly costs. An additional object of the invention is
to provide an electrical connector which minimizes the
number of components for the electrical connector.Another object of the invention is to provide
alignment features for each of the components so that the
components can be assembled in only one specific
orientation. A further object of the invention is to
provide higher contact retention so that the contact
cannot be unintentionally removed from the electrical
connector. Another object of the invention is to provide
a secondary lock which confirms that the contact is
properly positioned and also improves the retention of
the contact in the electrical connector. Another object
of the invention is to provide a secondary lock with a
first position which retains the secondary lock in a
partially inserted position and a second position which
locks the contact into the insulator after the contact
has been inserted.A further object of the invention is to reduce
the amount of insulator material used in the electrical
connector. An additional object of the invention is to
provide a contact removal tool which is included in the
electrical connector and can be used by a repair person
in a remote location.Also, an object of the invention is to provide
a backplate which prevents the
