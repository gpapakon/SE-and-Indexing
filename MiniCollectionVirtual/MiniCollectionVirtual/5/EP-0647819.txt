<ABSTRACT>
The device (1) for heating enclosed spaces comprises at 
least one closed-circuit pipeline (2), which is arranged 

above the enclosed space to be heated and acts by heat 
radiation, a burner (3), and a fan (4). The burner (3) is of 

the atmospheric-pressure type and the fan (4) injects air, 
drawn from the pipeline (2), laterally to the burner (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for heating
enclosed spaces, such as aircraft hangars, theaters, movie
theaters, high-rise warehouses, and buildings used for
commerce, industry and handicraft, which are usually tall
and have large surface areas.Systems are known for this purpose that comprise a
closed circuit composed of multiple pipelines which are
arranged approximately at the roof or ceiling of the
enclosed space; warm air is circulated inside these
pipelines.The heating effect is achieved by radiation from the
surface of said pipelines towards the floor by suitable
insulating reflecting screens.A system of this type is described in Italian patent
no. 1,037,880 and GB-A-1 448 073, which includes a burner located directly at
the pipeline and a fan for feeding the gaseous heating
medium through the pipeline; the fan is located upstream or
downstream of the burner.The burner is of the blast type and is inserted at the
pipeline, which has the configuration of a closed loop.This solution has a drawback: the use of air-blast
burners in fact produces a preset pressure in the pipeline,
and this pressure requires continuous and accurate
maintenance, which must be performed by extremely qualified
individuals, to check for any loss from said pipeline.Further heating systems are disclosed in the prior documents
EP-A-0 079 526 and EP-A-0 503 489.Furthermore, the use of air-blast gas burners requires
the manufacture of devices which are complicated from a
structural point of view and are difficult to optimize; the
large number of moving mechanical parts makes the device 
prone to breakages, and thus to considerable maintenance,
and entails high overall costs.An aim of the present invention is therefore to solve
the described technical problems, eliminating the drawbacks
of the described prior art and thus providing a device that
allows to heat enclosed spaces by radiation and has high-level
safety characteristics for its users.Within the scope of this aim, an important object is to
provide a device that has very low manufacturing and
maintenance costs.Another object is to provide a device that is simple to
set up, has a limited number of moving mechanical parts, and
allows the use of personnel that is not particularly trained
or qualified.Another object is to provide a device for heating
enclosed spaces by radiation which has very low installation
costs and is reliable and safe in use.With the foregoing and other objects in view, there is
provided a device as defined in the appended claims.Further

<CLAIMS>
Device for heating enclosed spaces, comprising at
least one closed-circuit pipeline (2) which acts by heat

radiation, a burner (3) for providing a flame at the
pipeline (2) for direct heating of a heating medium, and a

fan (4) arranged upstream of said burner (3) at said
pipeline for producing a negative pressure therein, said

heating medium being constituted by a mixture of combustion
gas and air, 
characterized in that
 said burner (3) is a
multiple-flame Venturi-tube burner providing a joint flame

extending into a flame tube (16) which laterally surrounds
said joint flame so as to provide a chamber (7) wherein the

heating medium is delivered laterally to the flame tube
(16), and is circulated thereabout, whereupon the heating

medium mixes, downstream of said flame tube (16), with flame
combustion gas and air drawn from outside due to the

negative pressure created by said fan (4) and by the jets of
pressurized combustible gas inside said multiple-flame

Venturi-tube burner.
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that
said burner (3) is located together with said fan (4) in a

containment element (5).
Device according to claims 1 and 2, characterized in
that said containment element (5) has an appropriate

insulation.
Device according to any of claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that said chamber (7) is a scroll chamber

formed between said flame tube (16) and said containment
element (5).
Device according to any of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that said pipeline (2) is arranged outside

said containment element (5) and is connected at a first end
to said chamber (7) and at a second end to the suction inlet

of said fan (4).
Device according to one or more of the preceding
claims, characterized in that it comprises a first gate

valve (8) which is interposed between said fan (4) and said
burner (3) and a second gate valve (9) that is connected to

a discharge duct (10).
Device according to claim 6, characterized in that
said discharge duct (10) is located at said fan (4) or

between said burner (3) and said fan (4).
Device according to one or more of the preceding
claims, characterized in that said fan (4) has a suction

inlet (13) located approximately at the center of said
pipeline (2).
Device according to one or more of the preceding
claims, characterized in that said burner (3) has a

preheater for heating the combustion air which is suitable to
increase thermal efficiency.
