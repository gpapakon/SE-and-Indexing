<ABSTRACT>
The arrangement has a tensioning band (15) which fits around the free end (16) of a first shank (13) of a rail (11) and is provided on the lower edge (9) of the cover (8). The tension band lies on both sides of the shank. A clamping strip (17) is pulled over the tensioning band and the first shank, and encloses the tensioning band on both sides. A reinforcement piece (18) is provided on the side of the cover directed towards the vehicle interior.

Means for fastening a bottom edge of a soft top to an angular rail, when viewed in 
cross-section, fastened to the rear frame of the motor vehicle and surrounding the 

passenger compartment in a curved manner, when seen in plan view, wherein a first leg 
extending substantially parallel to the lower edge of the soft top is constructed for 

supporting the lower edge, 
characterised in that
 
a tension member (15) extending around the free end (16) of the first leg (13) of the rail 

(11) is provided on the bottom edge (9) of the soft top (8) and preferably rests on both 
sides of the said leg (13), and a clamping strip (17) is slid over the tension member (15) 

and the first leg (13) and embraces both sides of the tension member (15). 
Means according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 a bottom edge (9) of the sort top (8) 
is provided - on the side facing a passenger compartment (7) - with a reinforcer (18) 

rigidly connected over the area to the soft top (8) lying thereon. 
Means according to Claims 1 and 2, 
characterised in that
 the tension member (15) is 
arranged on the inside of the reinforcer (18) and is connected only in a fastening 

section (22) rigidly to the reinforcer (18) and the soft top (8). 
Means according to Claim 3, 
characterised in that
 the fastening section (22) of the 
tension member (15) is arranged at a distance from the bottom edge (21) of the soft 

top (8). 
Means according to Claims 3 and 4, 
characterised in that
 the fastening section (22) is 
arranged adjacent a theoretical intersection (23) of the two legs (13, 14) of the rail (11). 
Means according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the clamping strip (17) is produced 
from stainless steel. 
Means according to Claims 1 and 5, 
characterised in that
 the profile of the clamping 
strip (17) is substantially U-shaped, when viewed in cross-section, wherein locally 

positioned spring tongues (29) are provided at least on one locking 
cross-member (24, 25) of the clamping strip (17) and co-operate with the tension 

member (15) and the first leg (13) of the rail (11) respectively by catching thereon in the 
direction of travel.  

 
Means according to one or more of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that
 a narrow 
connecting cross-member (26) extends between the two locking cross-members (24, 25) 

continuously along the entire length of the clamping strip (17), whereas the two locking 
cross-members (24, 25) have, at defined, uniform distances, recesses (27) extending from 

the free end (28) of the locking cross-members (24, 25) substantially up to the connecting 
cross-member (26). 
Means according to Claims 6 and 7, 
characterised in that
 the inwardly positioned 
spring tongues (29) are provided in the area of the wall sections (30), remaining between 

two adjacent recesses (27), of the locking cross-members (24, 25). 
Means according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 a sealing structure (32) co-operating 
with the rear frame is constructed integrally with the clamping strip (17). 
Means according to Claim 9, 
characterised in that
 a locking cross-member (e.g. 24) and 
a partial area of the connecting cross-member (26) of the clamping strip (17) are 

embedded in a foot section (33) of the sealing structure (32), wherein a projecting tubular 
profile section (34) is connected to the foot section (33). 
Means according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the clamping strip (17), when viewed 
in cross-section, has two meander-shaped sections (35, 36) positioned together, wherein 

one section (35) surrounds and rests against the tension member (15) on both sides, and 
the second section (36) holds a sealing structure (27) [sic-37]
. 
Means according to Claim 11 [sic-12], 
characterised in that
 the sealing structure (37) is 
mounted on a cross-member (38) of the second section (36).
