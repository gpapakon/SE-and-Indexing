<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a Marx generator, comprising several capacitors (C) connected in series, via spark gaps (E), between two output terminals (5, 6) and a power supply circuit charging the said capacitors in parallel. The series connection of the capacitors is provided by a flat line formed by two metal strips (3, 4) extending parallel and opposite one another. These strips are electrically linked together at one of the ends of the line and respectively to the output terminals (5, 6) at the other end, and comprise a first continuous strip (4) and a second strip (3) divided by transverse slots into successive flat segments (7, 8) interconnected in series alternately by a capacitor (C) and by a surface spark gap (E). Such a structure reduces the inductance of the generator and, in that way, enhances the rise time of the output pulses.

Marx generator, comprising a number of capacitors connected in series through 
spark gaps, between two output terminals and a power supply circuit which charges the 

said capacitors in parallel, the series connection of the capacitors (C) consisting of a 
flat line formed of two metal strips (3, 4) running facing one another, parallel to the 

same plane and in the same longitudinal direction (Y), these strips being connected 
together electrically at one end of the line and respectively to the output terminals (5, 

6) at the other end and consisting of one continuous strip (4) and a second strip (3) 
subdivided by transverse slots (iC, iE) into successive plane sections (7, 8, 7, 8,...) 

interconnected in series, alternately by a capacitor and a spark gap (E), which, when 
actuated, creates in the said slot, between the two sections, a plane conducting zone in 

the same plane as the said sections, characterised by the fact that each spark gap (E) 
comprises a metal actuation electrode (11) placed opposite the said slot (iE) and having 

a surface (11a) parallel to the said plane and dimensions similar to those of the slot, 
together with an insulating sheet (12) forming a spacer between the actuation electrode 

(11) and the edges ofthe said sections (7, 8). 
Generator according to claim 1, characterised by the fact that the distance (dn) 
between each pair of sections (7, 8) on the second strip (3) linked by a spark gap (E) 

and the first strip (4) is fixed as a function of the potential difference that appears 
between this pair of sections and the first strip when the spark gaps (E) are actuated 

and rendered conducting. 
Generator according to claim 2, characterised by the fact that the first strip (4) is flat, 
the second strip (3) being in the shape of a staircase.
