<ABSTRACT>
A plasma-addressed liquid crystal display device 
comprises a builtup structure including an upper glass 

substrate (1), a transparent dielectric sheet (2) brought 
into intimate contact with the upper substrate (1), and a 

lower glass substrate (3) disposed in face-to-face 
relation with the dielectric sheet (2). The upper glass 

substrate (1) has a plurality of data electrodes extending 
along one direction on the inner surface thereof. A 

plurality of discharge channels (7) extending along a 
direction intersecting the one direction is formed 

between the lower side of the dielectric sheet (2) and the 
lower glass substrate (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a plasma-addressed
liquid crystal display device and more particularly, to
the structure of a liquid crystal layer. The invention
also relates to a method for fabricating a plasma-addressed
liquid crystal device.Plasma-addressed liquid crystal display devices
are disclosed, for example, in
IEEE CIRCUITS AND DEVICES MAGAZINE, vol.6, no.5, September
1990, NEW YORK US pages 14 - 17 T.S.BUZAK 'PLASMA
ADDRESSING FOR FLAT-PANEL DISPLAYS', which also discloses polymer-dispersed (PDLC) liquid crystals, and in United States Patent No.
4,896,149 and United States Patent No. 5,077,553 which
corresponds to Japanese Published Unexamined (Kokai)
Patent Application No. 1-217396. As shown in Fig. 6,
the display device has a builtup flat panel structure
which includes a liquid crystal cell, a plasma cell 102,
and a dielectric sheet 103 intervening therebetween.
The plasma cell 102 is formed of a lower glass substrate
104 having grooves 105 each in the form of a stripe on
the surface thereof. The grooves 105 extend, for
example, along the row of a matrix. The respective
groves 105 are hermetically sealed with the dielectric
sheet 103 to establish individually separated discharge
channels 106. An ionizable gas is filled in each 
discharge channel. Protruded portions 107 with which
adjacent grooves 105 are separated from each other serve
as partition walls defining the individual discharge
channels 106. Each groove 105 has a curved bottom at
which a pair of discharge electrodes 108, 109 are
provided in parallel to each other. These electrodes,
respectively, function as an anode and a cathode and act
to ionize the gas in the discharge channel, thereby
generating a plasma. Such a discharge channel serves as
a row scanning unit.On the other hand, the liquid crystal cell is
constituted of an upper transparent substrate 110. The
substrate 110 is disposed in face-to-face relation with
the dielectric sheet 103 through a given space, in which
a liquid crystal layer 111 is filled. The substrate
110 is formed with data electrodes 112 on the inner
surface thereof. The data electrodes 112 are
intersected at right angles with the discharge channels
106 and serve, respectively, as column signal units.
Thus, there are established matrix-shaped pixels at the
intersected portions of the row signal units and the
column scanning units.In the display device having such a structure as
set out hereinabove, the discharge channels 106 are 
line-sequentially changed over and scanned. In
synchronism with the scanning,
