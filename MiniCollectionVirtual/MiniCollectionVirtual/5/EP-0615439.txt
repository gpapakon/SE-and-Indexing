<CLAIMS>
Slow-release medicament for the treatment of 
painful and/or inflammatory and febrile disorders, 

containing ibuprofen in addition to customary pharmaceutical 
excipients and auxiliaries, characterized in 

that the ibuprofen is present in the form of a pharmaceutically 
administrable nanosol which, as an excipient, 

essentially contains gelatin, fractionated gelatin or a 
gelatin derivative. 
Medicament according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the nanosol 


a) contains an inner phase comprising the 
ibuprofen, which has a particle size of 

10 - 800 nm and possesses a surface 
charge, 
b) an outer phase of gelatin, fractionated 
gelatin or a gelatin derivative, which is 

oppositely charged, and 
c) has a nearly or completely isoionic state 
of charge of the inner and outer phase, 

and 
d) is physiologically absorbable. 
Medicament according to Claim 1 and/or 2, characterized 
in that the ibuprofen is present as a solid, 

resuspendable nanodispersion. 
Medicament according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the ibuprofen has an average 

particle size of below 400 nm. 
Medicament according to one of Claims 1 - 4, 
characterized in that the gelatin has a maximum of the 

molecular weight distribution in the range from 10⁴ to  
 

10⁷ D. 
Medicament according to Claim 5, characterized in 
that the gelatin has a maximum of the molecular weight 

distribution of above 9.5 x 10⁴ D and a peptide content 
of less than 5 per cent by weight. 
Medicament according to one of Claims 1 - 6, 
characterized in that the gelatin has a percentage weight 

content of the microgel fraction (
>
 10⁷ D) of greater 
than 15%. 
Medicament according to one of Claims 1 - 7, 
characterized by an outer phase of the nanosol which 

additionally contains viscosity-increasing substances in 
a weight ratio of gelatin to synthetic or natural polymer 

much as 10:1 to 1000:1. 
Medicament according to one of Claims 1 - 8, 
characterized in that the slow-release form is a tablet. 
Medicament according to Claim 9, characterized in 

that the slow-release form is a matrix tablet. 
Medicament for the treatment of painful and/or 
inflammatory and febrile disorders, containing ibuprofen 

in addition to customary pharmaceutical excipients and 
auxiliaries, characterized in that it is partially 

present as an immediate-effect form and partially as a 
slow-release form containing ibuprofen in the form of a 

pharmaceutically administrable nanosol. 
Medicament according to Claim 11, characterized 
in that the immediate-effect and slow-release forms are 

present in a hard gelatin capsule. 
Medicament according to one of Claims 1 - 12, 
characterized in that the ibuprofen is present as a 

racemate. 
Medicament according to one of Claims 1 - 12, 
characterized in that the ibuprofen is present as a 

pseudoracemate. 
Medicament according to one of Claims 1 - 12, 
characterized in that the ibuprofen is present as pure 

S- or R-ibuprofen. 
Medicament according to one of Claims 1 - 12, 
characterized in that the ibuprofen is present as a  

 
mixture of S- and R-enantiomers. 
Medicament according to Claim 16, characterized 
in that the ibuprofen is present to at least 50% as 

R-ibuprofen. 
Medicament according to Claim 16, characterized 
in that the ibuprofen is present to at least 50% as 

S-ibuprofen. 
Use of a pharmaceutically administrable nanosol 
of ibuprofen which is present to at least 50% as S- or 

R-ibuprofen for the production of medicaments having 
analgesic and/or antirheumatic slow-release action.
