<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to oral hygiene compositions
comprising a cationic anti-bacterial agent and an anti-staining agent, for
use in treating or preventing dental plaque, caries, or periodontal diseases
of the oral cavity in humans or lower animals with reduced staining of
teeth.Cationic antibacterial agents such as chlorhexidine have long been
recognised as useful therapeutic agents for treating plaque, caries and
peridontal diseases due not only to their intrinsic in vitro antibacterial
activity against strains implicated in the formation of plaque but also
because of their substantivity to oral tissue. They are thus adsorbed onto
oral surfaces and gradually released over a period of time, to produce a
prolonged antibacterial effect and hence reduce or prevent the formation
of plaque over a period of time. It is believed that the deposition of plaque
onto the tooth surface is one of the first steps in the development of dental
caries and periodontal disease.It is however also widely recognised that the use of cationic
antibacterial agents in oral hygiene, in particular chlorhexidine, is
accompanied by the formation of a cosmetically disfiguring brown stain on
the tooth surfaces. This is believed to arise from an interaction between
the cationic antibacterial agent and certain dietary components,
particularly those rich in tannins such as tea, coffee and red wine. Whilst
this problem may to some extent be alleviated by brushing of the teeth
with a toothpaste prior to use of the product containing the cationic
antibacterial agent, in many instances it is found necessary to resort to
professionally administered scaling and polishing to remove the stain.In consequence there have been many suggestions in the patent
literature for chemical anti-staining agents which maybe incorporated
with the cationic antibacterial agent or which may, in some instances, be
used instead separately, after the cationic antibacterial agent. Examples
include carboxylic acids (US 4 256 731), aminocarboxylate compounds (US
4 080 441), phosphonoacetic acid (US 4 118 474), peroxydiphosphate salts
(US 4 273 759) and, more recently, a polymer having certain pendant
polyalkylene oxide chains (GB 2 213 721-A).We have now surprisingly found that the development of stain
may be at least substantially mitigated if not eliminated by the use of
another polymeric material viz polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP). This material 
is already used in some toothpastes at comparatively low levels (typically
about 0.1%) as an auxiliary thickening

<CLAIMS>
A mouthwash composition comprising a bacteriostatic effective amount of chlorhexidine
or an orally acceptable acid addition salt thereof, an anti-stain effective amount of

polyvinyl pyrrolidone, a non-ionic, cationic or amphoteric surfactant and an orally
acceptable carrier or excipient.
A composition as claimed in claim 1 in which polyvinyl pyrrolidone has an average
molecular weight in the range 5,000 to 100,000.
A composition as claimed in claim 1 or 2 in which polyvinyl pyrrolidone is present in
from at least 1% by weight of the composition.
A composition as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3 in which polyvinyl pyrrolidone is
present in from 2 to 30% by weight of the composition.
A composition as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4 further comprising an ionic
fluorine-containing compound.
A composition as defined in any one of claims 1 to 5 in which the surfactant comprises
a non-ionic surfactant.
A composition as defined in any one of claims 1 to 6 for use in therapy.
The use of polyvinyl pyrrolidone and chlorhexidine or an orally acceptable acid
addition salt thereof in the manufacture of a mouthwash composition with reduced

staining.
A mouthwash kit comprising as a first item a mouthwash composition comprising an
anti-stain effective amount of polyvinyl pyrrolidone and an orally acceptable carrier or

excipient and, as a separate second item, a mouthwash composition comprising a
bacteriostatic effective amount of chlorhexidine or an orally acceptable acid addition

salt thereof and an orally acceptable carrier or excipient, wherein said compositions
further comprise a non-ionic, cationic or amphoteric surfactant.
The use of polyvinyl pyrrolidone in the manufacture of a mouthwash composition for
use, separately, simultaneously or sequentially, with a mouthwash composition

comprising a bacteriostatic effective amount of chlorhexidine or an orally acceptable
acid addition salt thereof, to reduce or eliminate the stain associated with the use of a

mouthwash composition comprising chlorhexidine.
A process for preparing a mouthwash composition as defined in any one of claims 1 to
6 which process comprises admixing the ingredients in the appropriate amounts in any

order that is convenient and, if necessary, adjusting the pH to the final required value.
