<ABSTRACT>
A cut sheet feeder for use with an image forming 
apparatus, comprising: a sheet feed mechanism (3) for 

picking up stacked cut sheets (68,69) one at a time from 
a single sheet feed position (P2) and for feeding each 

sheet to an image recording portion; a sheet feed unit 
(10) which is vertically movable relative to the sheet 

feed mechanism (3) to which a cassette (K) containing 
cut sheets (69) may be attached in a detachable manner, 

and which has a cutout portion (14) corresponding to the 
position of the sheet feed mechanism; a sheet feed table 

(50) which is vertically movable within the sheet feed 
unit (10) and which carries a large number of cut sheets 

(68); and a sheet feed controller (100) for lifting, in 
a sheet feed mode based on the cassette (K), at least 

the sheet feed unit (10) up to a position where the cut 
sheets (69) in the cassette (K) reach the sheet feed 

position (P2); and for lifting, in a sheet feed mode 
based on the sheet feed table (50), the sheet feed unit 

(10) to a position where the top of the unit (10) comes 
above the sheet feed position (P2) with the cutout 

portion (14) of the unit letting the sheet feed 
mechanism (3) pass therethrough unchecked, thereby 

lifting the sheet feed table (50) up to a position where 
the cut sheets (69) on the sheet feed table (50) reach 

the sheet feed position (P2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cut sheet feeder 
for use with the image forming apparatus such as a copier 
or a printer, the feeder feeding the apparatus with cut 
sheets of recording paper. Examples of copiers include the following. US-A-4,165,069 discloses an electrophotographic copier 
having a cut sheet, two-bin, paper feed module which is 
selectively secured in copier-operative position, whereat 
it is operable to feed sheets to the copier's paper aligner 
and transfer station, or is removable to a copier-inoperative 
position whereat the module remains operative 
to feed sheets for the purpose of examination, analysis, 
and/or repair and maintenance of the paper feed module. GB-A-2,216,501 discloses a single-sheet feeder for a 
copier or printer which comprises a plurality of magazines 
installed beneath the printer, each equipped to receive a 
stack of sheets and which can be pulled out for refilling, 
as a drawer. Each magazine also comprises a single-sheet 
feed mechanism and conveying rollers so that sheets from a 
magazine below the uppermost magazine are conveyed through 
the superimposed magazines in a substantially vertical 
path. As described, the direction in which the drawers are 
pulled out corresponds to the direction of feeding of 
successive single sheets from a stack in a magazine. US-A-4,089,516 discloses a multibin, cut-sheet 
xerographic copier capable of operating in a simplex or a  
 
duplex copy mode, wherein sheets are fed from a selected 
sheet stack, one at a time, to the copier's transfer 
station, by a sheet feeding means which includes a combing 
wheel. The combing wheel shingles the leading edge of the 
stack's top sheet to an open feed roller nip, to be sensed 
thereat by a pneumatic sensor. Sensing of this leading 
edge causes the combing wheel to be lifted off the stack. 
Subsequently, at a time determined by the copier's control 
logic, the drive nip closes to thereby feed the top sheet 
to the copier's paper registration gate, and then to its 
transfer station. As soon as this sheet's trailing edge 
has cleared the pneumatic sensor, and the drive nip has 
opened, the next sheet is staged at the shingled position, 
in the open drive nip. Means are provided to deshingle the stack when the 
copier's paper supply drawer is opened, as for reloading 
paper. The combing wheel, drive nip and associated assemblies 
are supported by a single frame member, and are thus 
removable as a unit for replacement or repair.  
 The image forming apparatus is most often used to

<CLAIMS>
A cut sheet feeder for use with an image 
forming apparatus, comprising 

a sheet feed mechanism for picking up stacked cut 
sheets one at a time from a single sheet feed position 

and for feeding each sheet to an image recording portion;
 
characterized by: 


a sheet feed unit which is vertically movable 
relative to said sheet feed mechanism, to which a 

cassette containing cut sheets may be attached in a 
detachable manner, and which has a cutout portion 

corresponding to the position of said sheet feed 
mechanism; 
a sheet feed table which is vertically movable 
within said sheet feed unit and which carries a large 

number of cut sheets; and 
sheet feed control means for lifting, in a sheet 
feed mode based on said cassette, at least said sheet 

feed unit up to a position where the cut sheets in said 
cassette reach the sheet feed position; and for lifting, 

in a sheet feed mode based on said sheet feed table, said 
sheet feed unit to a position where the top of said sheet 

feed unit comes above said sheet feed position with said 
cutout portion letting said sheet feed mechanism pass 

therethrough unchecked, thereby lifting said sheet feed 
table up to a position where the cut sheets on said sheet 

feed table reach said sheet feed position. 
A cut sheet feeder as claimed in claim 1
 
   wherein said sheet feed unit and said sheet feed 

table are connected respectively to two clutches engaged 
with a motor acting as a driving source so that said 

sheet feed unit and said sheet feed table are vertically 
moved either singly or in combination depending on the 

switching of the clutches;
 
   said sheet feed unit and said sheet feed table 

being moved in combination when the two clutches are both 
engaged with said motor whereas if only one of the two 

clutches is engaged with said motor, either said sheet 
feed unit or said sheet feed table connected to the 

engaged clutch is moved vertically.  
 
A cut sheet feeder for use with an image 
forming apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said 

sheet feed unit and said sheet feed table are connected 
respectively to two clutches engaged with a motor, and 

wherein said sheet feed control means controls the 
switching of the two clutches so that said sheet feed 

unit and said sheet feed table are vertically moved 
either singly or in combination. 
A cut sheet feeder for use with an image 
forming apparatus according to c
laim 1, further 
comprising a sheet feed upper limit sensor and cassette 

presence detection means, said sheet feed upper limit 
sensor detecting whether the cut sheets either in said 

sheet feed unit or on said sheet feed table are set to 
said sheet feed position and outputting a detection 

signal accordingly, said cassette presence detection 
means detecting the presence and absence of a cassette on 

said sheet feed unit and outputting a detection signal 
indicating either the presence or the absence of said 

cassette;
 
   wherein said sheet feed control means verifies 

whether the sheet feed mode based on said cassette or the 
sheet feed mode based on said sheet feed table is in 

effect in accordance with the detection signal from said 
cassette presence detection means, and lifts either said 

sheet feed unit or said sheet feed table up to said sheet  
 

feed position on the basis of the detection signal from 
said sheet feed upper limit sensor. 
A cut sheet feeder for use with an image 
forming apparatus according to claim 4, wherein said 

cassette presence detection means are composed of a sheet 
size indication member and sheet size output means, said 

sheet size indication member being attached to said 
cassette to indicate the size of the cut sheets contained 

therein, said sheet size output means being attached to 
said sheet feed unit to output a sheet size signal upon 

detecting size indication data coming from said sheet 
size indication member of said cassette. 
A cut sheet feeder for use with an image 
forming apparatus according to claim 5, wherein said 

sheet size indication member is a magnet attached to a 
different position of said cassette depending on the size 

of cut sheets contained therein, and wherein said sheet 
size output means is a reed switch corresponding 

locationally to said magnet of said cassette and
