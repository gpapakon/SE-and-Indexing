<ABSTRACT>
The lightweight road vehicle has a load-bearing structure (2) with a transverse tube (10) arranged under the driver's and passenger's seats (5, 6). The closed cross-section of said transverse tube is formed by a floor panel (14), a top panel (11), a front wall (12) and a rear wall (13). The transverse tube is connected to at least two longitudinally running side profiles (21, 22). This results in a light, stiff and safe structure. An energy store (31), which is arranged in the transverse tube, produces a particularly favourable distribution of weight.

Lightweight road vehicle with an energy 
accumulator (3), in particular electric car 

with traction batteries, with adjacent 
driver's and passenger seats and with a 

supporting structure (2) which has a cross 
tube (10) arranged beneath the driver's and 

passenger seats (5, 6), and two end-sided 
support sections running in the longitudinal 

direction, which are connected with the cross 
tube, characterised in that the cross tube has 

an enclosed cross-section with floor plate 
(14), top plate (11), front wall (12) and rear 

wall (13) as tube walls, at least three of 
four tube walls (11, 12, 13, 14) being 

interconnected and the cross tube being 
connected with and supported at the front by 

at least two end-sided support sections (21, 
22) running in the longitudinal direction, 

wherein at least one section of the energy 
accumulator (31) is arranged in the cross tube 

(10) and wherein the floor plate (14) or the 
top plate (11) of the cross tube is designed 

to be detachable. 
Vehicle according to claim 1 characterised in 
that at least part of the cross-section of the 

cross tube is extending above a plane which is 
defined by the axles of the wheels (53, 54). 
Vehicle according to claim 1 or 2 
characterised in that the interconnections 

beween the cross tube (10) and tube-shaped 
longitudinal sections (21, 22) have force 

transmitting junctions (29).  
 
Vehicle according to one of the preceding 
claims characterised in that the interior 

space of the vehicle (20) is hermetically 
sealed by top plate (11), front wall (12) and 

rear wall (13) from the inside (16) of the 
cross tube. 
Vehicle according to one of the preceding 
claims characterised in that the height (H) of 

the cross tube (10) is at least 15 cm and its 
width (W) is at least 25 cm. 
Vehicle according to one of the preceding 
claims characterised in that the cross tube 

(10) is at least partially double-skinned 
(17), for example, is of a sandwich 

construction. 
Vehicle according to one of the preceding 
claims characterised in that the cross tube is 

arranged centrally (25) between front axle 
(53) and rear axle (54). 
Vehicle according to one of the preceding 
claims characterised in that the cross tube 

has side walls (15) and latticework-like 
reinforcements (47). 
Vehicle according to one of the preceding 
claims characterised by a hybrid drive 

including an electric motor and a thermal 
engine, each with a corresponding energy 

accumulator.  
 
Vehicle according to one of the preceding 
claims characterised in that double-skinned 

doors (24) and lower longitudinal sections 
(21, 22) connect laterally immediately on the 

cross tube (10) and in that the doors and the 
longitudinal sections contain energy-absorbing 

material (28). 
Vehicle according to one of the preceding 
claims characterised in that the cross tube is 

also supported at the front by a central 
longitudinal special section tube (23). 
Vehicle according to one of the preceding 
claims characterised in that ventilation (18) 

is provided through the longitudinal sections 
(21, 22, 23) and the cross tube. 
Vehicle according to one of the preceding 
claims characterised by a front wall (26) that 

ascends diagonally in front and which is 
connected with the cross tube by the wheel 

casings (30) and the longitudinal sections 
(21, 22, 23). 
Vehicle according to claim 13 characterised by 
a vehicle nose (27) designed to form a crush 

zone in front of the front wall which is at 
least partially filled with energy-absorbing 

material (28). 
Vehicle according to claim 13 characterised in 
that part of the energy accumulator (32) is 

arranged on the vehicle floor (8) and in front 
of the front wall (26) or behind the rear wall 

(46).  
 
Vehicle according to claim 13 characterised in 
that the supporting structure (2) has two 

lateral structural rings (34, 35), made of 
longitudinal sections (21, 22), windscreen 

frames (36, 37), door frames (38) and roof 
frame (39) which are connected with the cross 

tube and the front wall. 
Vehicle according to claim 16 characterised in 
that at least one transversal roof section 

(44), one front windscreen section (45), one 
rear transversal wall (46) and one vehicle 

floor (8) in the form of further structural 
elements are connected with the lateral 

structural rings (34, 35). 
Vehicle according to one of the preceding 

claims characterised in that the supporting 
structure (2) consists at least partially of 

fibre composite materials. 
Vehicle according to one of the claims 1 to 17
