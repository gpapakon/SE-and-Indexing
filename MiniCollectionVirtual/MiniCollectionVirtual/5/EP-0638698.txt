<ABSTRACT>
In order to provide an edge-protecting border which can be easily produced, is not susceptible to thermal changes in length, does not permit the formation of bubbles and is of an increased stability, in particular dimensional stability, the invention provides a process for producing an edge-protecting border with an, in particular, plastic angle profile having two legs which are positioned one upon the other and to which there are connected, to form the extension of the same, reinforcement mats, as corner reinforcement for a heat-insulating layer or masonry-wall corner bearing the fair-faced plaster, the border strips of the reinforcement mats projecting beyond the outer longitudinal borders of the angle profile. Said process is distinguished in that the reinforcement mats, in particular reinforcement fabric, are mechanically fixed, in particular fastened, on the angle profile in a positively locking manner.

Method for producing an edge protecting border (1) having an angle
section (2) with two superimposed sides (3, 4, 23, 24) as a corner reinforcement

for a wall or thermal insulation layer edge carrying parging, reinforcing
meshes (7) engaging on the angle section (2) and projecting with their

marginal strips (8, 9) over the outer longitudinal edges (10, 11) of the
angle section (2) are fixed to the latter, characterized in that following

the production of the angle section (2) and reinforcing meshes (7) the
reinforcing meshes (7) are positively fixed to the sides (3, 4, 23, 24) of

the angle section (2) by sewing using threads (15).
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that fixing by sewing
takes place in such a way that the thread lengths are alternately guided on

the side of the angle section facing and the side of the angle section
remote from the reinforcing mesh.
Method according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the thread
lengths project over both the front and back of the angle section and

reinforcing mesh.
Method according to one of the claims 1 to 3, characterized in that sewing
takes place by means of a needle, the movement sequences thereof corresponding

to those of a sewing machine needle.
Method according to one of the claims 1 to 4, characterized in that
sewing takes place following the punching of holes onto the sides of the

completely hardened angle sections.
Method according to one of the claims 1 to 5, characterized in that
following the complete hardening of the angle section holes are punched into

each of its sides.
Method according to one of the claims 1 to 6, characterized in that the
angle sections are produced by extrusion.
Edge protecting border (1, 21) with reinforcing meshes (7) and with an
angle section (2) having two superimposed sides (3, 4, 23, 24) as a corner 

reinforcement for a wall or thermal insulation layer edge carrying parging,
the reinforcing meshes (7) engaging on the angle section (2) and projecting

by their marginal strips (8, 9) over the external longitudinal edges
(10, 11) of the angle section (2) are fixed to the latter, characterized by

sewn threads (15) for fixing the reinforcing meshes (7) to the sides (3, 4,
23, 24) of the angle section (2).
Edge protecting border according to claim 8, characterized in that the
edge protecting border (1, 21) alternately has thread lengths (15) on the

side (18) of the angle section (2) facing and the side (18) of the angle
section (2) remote from the reinforcing mesh (7).
Edge protecting border according to claim 8 or 9, characterized in that
the thread lengths engage over both the angle section (2) and reinforcing

mesh (7).
Edge protecting border according to one of the claims 8 to 10, characterized
in that the angle point (5, 25) formed by the superimposed sides

(3, 4, 23, 24) of the angle section (2) is smooth.
Edge protecting border according to one of the claims 8 to 11, characterized
in that the angle point (5, 25) formed by the superimposed sides

(3, 4, 23, 24) of the angle section (2, 22) is provided with a projection
(14).
Method for the angle reinforcement of a wall or thermal protection layer
edge to be provided with parging, in which an edge protecting border (1)

formed from an angle section (2) and reinforcing meshes (7) fixed thereto
and projecting with outer longitudinal edges (10, 11) over the angle section

(2) is produced and the thus produced angle protecting border is fitted to
a wall or thermal insulating layer edge, characterized in that prior to the

fitting of the angle protecting border (1) to a wall or thermal insulation
layer edge, the reinforcing meshes (7) are positively fixed by sewing using

threads (15) to the sides (3, 4, 23, 24) of the angle section (2) and only
the thus produced angle protecting borders are fitted to the wall or thermal

insulation layer edge. 
Corner reinforcement of a wall or thermal insulation layer edge with an
edge protecting border with reinforcing meshes (7) and with an angle section

(2) with two superimposed sides (3, 4, 23, 24) applied to the wall or
thermal insulation layer edge, the reinforcing meshes (7) engaging on the

marginal strips (8, 9) on the angle section (2) and projecting over the
outer longitudinal edges (10, 11) thereof are fixed to the angle section (2),

characterized in that the reinforcing meshes (7) are fixed to the sides
(3, 4, 23, 24) of the angle section (2) by sewn threads and the thus constructed

edge protecting borders are fitted to the wall or thermal insulation
layer edges.
