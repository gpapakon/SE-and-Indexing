<ABSTRACT>
A rotary cutoff device (25) for reducing noise generated by the 
impeller blading (22b) of rotating centrifugal fans. The rotary device (25) 

includes a casing (26) partially enclosing a rotor (30) mounted near the 
centrifugal fan discharge opening (29). The rotor (30) containing a plurality 

of resonator cavities consisting either of quarter wave length 
resonators or of Helmholtz type resonators, each cavity being 

oriented preferably transverse to the rotor axis and having a 
length/diameter ratio in the range of 8/1-16/1. The rotor (30) can be 

rotatably adjustable relative to the fan impeller (22), or it can be 
driven by a motor at a surface speed 3⊘-1⊘⊘% that of the fan impeller 

surface speed, so that the rotor resonator cavities act as either 
quarter wave length or Helmholtz resonators to absorb effectively 

the acoustic pulsations generated by the centrifugal fan blade pass 
frequency of the fan and its harmonics, and reduce substantially 

the noise generated by centrifugal fans.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to noise reduction for centrifugal fans, 
and particularly pertains to a rotary cutoff device attachable to 
such fans and method for reducing noise pulsations produced by 
operation of the fan. Centrifugal fans are widely used in steam generator/power plant 
systems, process plants, mines, tunnel ventilation and other systems 
having requirements of moving large quantities of air or gases. 
It is known that these fans are inherently quite noisy, and special 
efforts have been exerted to reduce the emitted fan noise to 
environmentally acceptable levels. The standard noise reduction 
methods used include extensive sound insulation of the fan housing, 
sound insulation of the fan upstream and downstream ducting, and 
installation of fan inlet and discharge silencing equipment. 
However, such noise reduction methods add significantly to the fan 
installation costs, and the inlet and discharge silencers introduce 
pressure drop losses which lead to increased power consumption. Because of these deficiencies in the known arrangements for 
noise reduction for centrifugal fans, various other noise reduction 
means have been developed. For example, U.S. Patent No. 3.712,412 
discloses a sound suppressing system for high velocity 
fluid streams such as from high speed fans by using tunable resonating 
chambers. U.S 4.174 ⊘2⊘ and U.S. 4.279.325 disclose 
stationary sound insulation apparatus having cavities for acoustic 
treatment for centrifugal fans. Also, U.S. 4,475,621 
disclose use of acoustic sound reduction chambers for a 
combustion furnace. However, further improvements are needed for  
 
effective reduction of undesirable noise produced by large 
operating fans such as from centrifugal fans. EP-039459 describes a centrifugal fan with a resonator 
positioned at the throat of the fan housing to absorb certain 
sound frequencies. JP-61040492 describes a centrifugal fan having an irregular 
rotatable component at the throat of the fan housing to reduce 
sound output. According to the invention there is provided a method for 
reducing noise produced by operation of a centrifugal fan, 
comprising attaching a device onto a centrifugal fan housing at 
a location near the housing discharge opening operating the 
centrifugal fan impeller at a rotary speed selected to provide 
a desired gas flow rate and discharge pressure from the fan, 
characterised in that the device includes a rotor which is 
rotatable in a casing and contains a plurality of resonator 
cavities sized for absorption of
