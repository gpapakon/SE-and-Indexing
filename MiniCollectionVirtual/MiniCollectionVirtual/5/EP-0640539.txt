<ABSTRACT>
A distribution chute (10) for bulk material, especially for use in a coneless blast-furnace charging plant, has a plurality of inclined transverse slats (26) in the region of the impact portion (18). These form retaining pockets (38) between their inner face (34) and the surface (24) of the distribution chute (10). Every two adjacent transverse slats (26) delimit a retaining chamber (40) between the outer face (32) of the first transverse slat and the inner face of the second tranverse slat. When the inclination of the chute is reduced, the bulk material is distributed out of the retaining pocket (38) into the retaining chamber (40).

Distribution chute for bulk material, in particular for use in a bell-less
blast furnace charging plant, with an impact section (18) and a sliding

section (20) for the bulk material, retaining chambers (40), which can fill
up with bulk material for protection of the distribution chute, being formed

on the surface of the distribution chute,
characterised in
that the distribution chute (10, 10') has several transverse bars (26)
inclined to the surface with at least a top edge (30) and an outer surface

(32) made from a largely wear-resistant material in the area of the impact
section (18) on its surface (24), these transverse bars (26) being inclined

in the opposite direction to the bulk material flow in such a way that they
form retaining recesses (38) between their inner surface (34) opposite

the outer surface (32) and the surface (24) of the distribution chute (10,
10') and
that in each case two adjacent transverse bars (26) form between the
outer surface (32) of the first transverse bar and the inner surface of the

second transverse bar a retaining chamber (40) with a free opening
between their largely wear-resistant top edges (30) in such a way that

the net volume of a retaining recess (38) accounts for at least 20% of the
net total volume of the corresponding retaining chamber (40), wherein

the net volume of a retaining recess (38) corresponds to the partial area
of the net total volume of the corresponding retaining chamber (40),

which lies between the inner surface (34) of a transverse bar (26) and
the projection of this inner surface (34) at right angles to the surface (24)

of the chute.
Distribution chute according to claim 1, characterised in that the
transverse bars (26) are inclined at an angle between 40° and 60° to the

surface (24) of the distribution chute. 
Distribution chute according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the
retaining recesses (38) are designed in such a way that in the case of a

vertical chute position the surface (24) of the distributor chute (10) is
covered with a protective layer of bulk material in the retaining chambers

(40).
Distribution chute according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that
the free openings to the retaining chambers (40) are larger than the

largest, statistically relevant particle diameter of the bulk material.
Distribution chute according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that
the retaining chambers (40) are subdivided by longitudinal bars (42)

between the transverse bars (26).
Distribution chute according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that
the distribution chute has a largely smooth and wear-resistant discharge

surface (46) at least in the discharge area of the sliding section (20).
Distribution chute according to claim 6, characterised in that the
discharge surface (46) extends a (hypothetical) flow surface defined by

the top edges of the transverse bars (26) without a transition step.
Distribution chute according to claim 6 or 7, characterised in that hollow
chambers (50) are formed between the discharge surface (46) and a

chute element (12) of the distribution chute.
Distribution chute according to claim 8, characterised in that the hollow
chambers (50) are filled with a thermal insulating material (52). 
Distribution chute according to one of claims 1 to 9, characterised in that
the retaining chambers (40) are filled with a pourable, hardening

material.
Distribution chute according to one of claims 1 to 9, characterised in that
the retaining chambers (40) are filled with shaped bricks.
