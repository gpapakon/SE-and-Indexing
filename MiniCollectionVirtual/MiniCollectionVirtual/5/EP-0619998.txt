<ABSTRACT>
A container capable of containing components of a 
mixture in chambers separated by a peelable seal 

constructed from a multi-layer film. The multi-layer 
film has at least one layer of a RF-responsive material 

and an interior layer of non-RF responsive material. 
When the layers are subjected to RF energy, the RF-responsive 

layer heats the interior layers resulting in 
a bond in the form of a peelable seal between the 

interior layers. The peelable seal is capable of 
withstanding external pressures to the container, such 

as from dropping the container. The seal may be 
selectively opened to allow mixture of components 

contained therein.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to flexible
containers for housing liquid products. More
particularly, the present invention relates to multi-chamber
containers having a selectively openable seal
line between two chambers.Flexible containers, constructed from plastic
films, are commonly used in the medical field for
containing, inter alia, parenteral, enteral, and dialysis
solutions. A great variety of such solutions can be
housed and stored in such containers.There are, however, a number of products that due
to stability, compatibility, or other concerns must be
stored in component parts in separate containers and
admixed before use. For example, amino acid and dextrose
solutions require separate storage containers or
compartments. These components, therefore, are stored
separately and then mixed prior to use.One of the disadvantages of storing components in
separate containers and then mixing them together is that
the mixing process can compromise sterility of the
system. Additionally, this step creates a labor intense
process.To deal with the disadvantages of separate
containers, it is known to provide multiple chamber
containers having an interior including two or more
chambers. One way to create such a container is with
a heat seal dividing the interior into two chambers.
Such containers are disclosed, for example, in U.S.
Patent Nos. 4,396,388; 4,770,295; 3,950,158; 4,000,996;
and 4,226,330.It is known to use frangible valves between the 
heat seal to allow for selective communication and mixing of the two
components stored in the separate chambers. See, for example, U.S.
Patent No. 4,396,488.However, such a structure - frangible valves - may not be desirable for a
number of reasons, including, inter alia, cost. An alternative to frangible
valves is disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,950,158, 4,000,996 and
4,226,330, where multiple chamber containers are disclosed with a line of
weakness, such as a score line, which breaks upon the application of
pressure.In U.S. Patent No. 4,770,295, a selectively openable seal line is
positioned between two sheets of flexible thermoplastic material. The seal
line is resistant to unintentional opening forces, but opens upon
application of a specific force. The seal line may be employed in various
containers, including a two chamber container for the separate storage and
selective mixing of two medical substances. The container includes two
sheets forming the exterior of the container and an inner diaphragm sheet
between the outer sheets. One selectively

<CLAIMS>
A container (10) including an interior having at least two
compartments (12, 14) separated by a peelable seal (16), the seal being

constructed from a film comprising:

a non-RF-responsive layer (46) for forming an interior of the
container;
an RF-responsive layer (44) in contact with the non-RF responsive
layer and
the non-RF responsive layer (46) bonding with an opposite non-RF
responsive layer (56) and forming a peelable seal (16), 
characterised in
that
 the non-RF responsive layer is a blend of at least two materials
having different melting points.
The container of claim 1, wherein the non-RF responsive layer (46)
includes an alloy of styrene-ethylene-butyl-styrene and ethylene propylene

copolymer.
The container of claim 1 or Claim 2, wherein the RF responsive
layer (44) includes ethyl vinyl acetate.
The container of any one of the preceding claims further
comprising an outside layer (40) coupled to the RF-responsive layer (44).
The container of any one of the preceding claims further
comprising a tie layer (42) and an outside layer (40) wherein the tie layer

is between the outside layer and the RF-responsive layer (44). 
The container of any one of the preceding claims including at
least two ports (26, 30).
The container of any one of the preceding claims wherein the seal
line (16) divides the container into substantially equal volume chambers

(12, 14).
The container of any one of the preceding claims, wherein the
peelable seal is RF sealed.
A method for making a multi-chamber container (10) comprising the
steps of:


providing a web of plastic film having a first non-RF-responsive
layer (46) and a second RF-responsive layer (44);
sealing opposing edges of the web of film to create an interior
defined, at least in part, by the inner layer; and
creating an inner seal (16) defining at least two chambers (12, 14) by
applying RF energy and causing a portion of opposing inner layers (46, 56)

to seal to themselves, 
characterised in that
 the first non-RF-responsive layer
(46) comprises two materials having different melting points and the RF

energy applied is sufficient to melt only one of the two materials that
comprise the first non-RF responsive layer.
The method of claim 9 comprising the step of filling at least one
chamber with a medical solution.
The method of claim 9 or claim 10, wherein the first non-RF
responsive layer (46) includes a styrene-ethylene-butyl-styrene and ethylene

propylene copolymer. 
The method of any one of Claims 9 to 11, wherein the film
includes at least three layers.
The method of any one of claims 9 to 12, wherein the RF responsive
layer (44) includes ethylene vinyl acetate.
The method of any one of claims 9 to 13 including the step of
providing the container with at least two ports (26, 30).
The method of any one of claims 9 to 14 including the step of filling
a first (12) and second (14) chamber with different medical solutions.
