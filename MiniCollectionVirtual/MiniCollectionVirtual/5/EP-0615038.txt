<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a cladding for facades, walls, ceilings and the like, composed of a plurality of thin-walled profile rails (2) which are arranged parallel to one another, such that they overlap, on a profile-like substructure (1) and have a trapezoidal cross-section, and of two adjoining fastening webs (4a,4b), of which at least one rests on the substructure (1) and is secured there via screws inserted into corresponding bores. In order that the profile rails (2) are designed, and fastened on the substructure (1), such that the heads of the screws can no longer be seen, the fastening web (4b) resting on the substructure (1) exhibits at least two spaced-apart, tongue-like securing means (7) which run inwards from the border by way of punched-out portions (8) and the tongue (7a) of which runs parallel to the fastening web (4b), approximately at the distance of the thickness of the wall of the profile rail (2), and the other fastening web (4a) of the profile rail (2) runs inwards, parallel to the plane of the profile rail (2), and is designed such that it can be plugged into the securing means (7) of an adjacent profile rail (2) which has already been fastened on the substructure (1).
