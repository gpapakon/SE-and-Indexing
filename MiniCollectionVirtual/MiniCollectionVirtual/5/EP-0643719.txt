<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the reception of the
cytokine known as interleukin 9 by cells, via its
receptor. More particularly, it relates to the isolation
of nucleic acid sequences which code for interleukin 9
receptor molecules ("IL-9R" hereafter). These sequences
can be used, e.g. as a source for IL-9 receptor, and as
probes for cells which respond to the cytokine. The
complementary sequences can be used to inhibit expression
as well as to probe for the coding sequences.The last decade has seen knowledge of the immune
system and its regulation expand tremendously. One area
of particular interest has been that of research on the
proteins and glycoproteins which regulate the immune
system. Perhaps the best known of these molecules, which
are generically referred to as "growth factors",
"cytokines", "leukotrienes", "lymphokines", etc., is
interleukin-2 ("IL-2"). See, e.g., U.S. Patent No.
4,778,879 to Mertelsmann et al.; U.S. Patent No.
4,490,289, to Stern; U.S. Patent No. 4,518,584, to Mark
et al.; and U.S. Patent No. 4,851,512 to Miyaji et al.
Additional patents have issued which relate to
interleukin 1 - ("IL-1"), such as U.S. Patent No.
4,808,611, to Cosman.In order for molecules such as IL-2 and IL-1 to
exert their effect on cells, it is now pretty much
accepted that these must interact with molecules, located
on cell membranes, referred to as receptors. Patents
which exemplify disclosures of interleukin receptors 
include Honjo et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,816,565; and
Urdal et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,578,335.
Recently,
Fanslow, et al., Science 248: 739-41 (May 11, 1990)
presented data showing that the effect of IL-1 in vivo
could be regulated via the administration of a soluble
form of its receptor. The last paragraph of the Fanslow
paper, the disclosure of which is incorporated by
reference, describes the types of therapeutic efficacy
administration of soluble IL-1 receptor ("IL-1R") is
expected to have.The lymphokine IL-9, previously referred to as
"P40", is a T-cell derived molecule which was originally
identified as a factor which sustained permanent antigen
independent growth of T4 cell lines. See, e.g.,
Uyttenhove, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 85: 6934
(1988), and Van Snick et al., J. Exp. Med. 169: 363
(1989),
and Simpson et al., Eur. J. Biochem.
183: 715 (1989).The activity of IL-9 was at first observed to act on
restricted T4 cell lines, failing to show activity on
CTLs or freshly isolated T cells. See, e.g., Uyttenhove
et al., supra, and Schmitt et al., Eur. J. Immunol. 19:
2167 (1989).
