<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of manufacturing a planar antenna, operating at a frequency of a few GHz, comprising at least one circuit layer, in which, for each circuit layer, a selective metallisation is produced on a support (10) of organic material, having a low dielectric constant, less than 2.5, and low losses, less than 10
<
-3
>
 by deposition of a layer (11) of conducting material over all or part of at least one surface of the said support, thus making it possible to define the conducting parts of this circuit, possibly after deposition of an intermediate layer (12) intended to improve the surface state of the said support. The invention relates particularly to a planar antenna operating at such a frequency. Application particularly to the field of telecommunications with mobile units.

Process for producing a flat-top antenna operating at a frequency of a
few GHz and comprising at least one circuit layer, in which, for each circuit

layer, a metallization takes place by the direct deposition of a conductive
material layer (11) on all or part of at least one surface of an organic

material support, defining the conductive portions of said circuit,

characterized in that
 the support is formed prior to said direct deposition
by a laminate constituted by a foam layer (10) covered on at least one of its

two faces by an unexpanded, organic material layer (17), the deposition of
the conductive material layer taking place on the unexpanded, organic

material layer and 
in that
 the organic material has a dielectric constant
below 2.5 and losses below 10
-3
.
Process according to claim 1, wherein the conductive material is
constituted by a conductive paste with an organic binder based on silver-filled

ethyl cellulose.
Process according to either of the claims 1 and 2, wherein a
transformation operation takes place on the conductive material layer (11) so

as to make it adherent to the support and a good conductor.
Process according to one of the claims 1 to 3, wherein the organic
material support is previously shaped prior to the selective deposition of

the conductive material layer (11).
Process according to one of the claims 1 to 4, wherein to at least one of
the faces of the antenna is connected one or more metallized support material

layers (11) by intercalating one or more adherent, organic material sheets
(13).
Process according to claim 5, wherein each adherent organic material
layer is of polypropylene or polypropylene copolymer.
Process according to either of the claims 5 and 6, wherein the
juxtapositioning of the layers takes place by hot calendering or pressing.
Process according to one of the claims 5 to 7, wherein electrical
connections (15) between conductive planes (11) are produced with the aid of

a conductive paste formed from an organic binder based on silver-filled ethyl
cellulose.
Process according to one of the claims 1 to 8, wherein deposition takes 
place of a radome (16), formed from an organic foam, polypropylene,

polypropylene copolymer or protecting lacquer layer adhering to one of the
outer faces of the antenna.
Process according to one of the claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that
 the
foam is a polymethacrylate imide foam.
