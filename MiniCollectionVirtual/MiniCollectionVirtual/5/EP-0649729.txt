<ABSTRACT>
In a conveyor device with an endless conveyor belt (10) which is guided in a belt curve and is placed over deflecting rollers rotatably mounted at both ends in a belt structure and of which the upper strand (10h) runs approximately horizontally and the lower strand (10t) is inclined at an angle (t) to the upper strand (10h), the cross-section of the conical deflecting rollers widens towards the outside of the curve, and the conveyor belt (10) has, on the outside of the curve, a roller (48) with a circumferential surface (49) arranged approximately at right angles thereto and a pair of further rollers (35, 36), near the outside of the curve, with circumferential surfaces (37, 38) approximately parallel to the conveyor belt (10). These two circumferential surfaces (37, 38) pointing in the same direction butt against counter-surfaces (39, 43; 42, 52) of the belt structure which point towards one another with their height offset, in such a way that the counter-surfaces form with the adjacent circumferential surfaces, in relation to the roller axis or axes (34), contact lines which are in each case located at a distance from this/these and opposite thereto.

Conveyor comprising an endless conveyor belt (10) guided along a curve and
placed over deflecting rollers rotatably supported at either end in a supporting

structure, the tight side (10h) of the conveyor belt offering a conveying surface
extending substantially horizontally and its slack side (10t) being inclined at an

angle (t) relative to the tight side (10h), the cross section of the conical deflecting
rollers increasing towards the outside of the curve and the conveyor belt (10)

being provided on the outside of the curve with a roller (48) with a circumferential
surface (49) substantially perpendicular thereto and close to the outside of the

curve with another roller (36) with a circumferential surface (38) substantially
parallel to the conveyor belt (10) and both circumferential surfaces (49, 38) rolling

on the supporting structure, characterised in that a roller (35) with a
circumferential surface (37) pointing in the same direction is associated with the

roller (36) with a circumferential surface (38) substantially parallel to the tight
side (10h) of the conveyor belt (10), these two circumferential surfaces bearing

against vertically offset mating surfaces (39, 43, 42, 52) of the supporting
structure in such a manner that the latter form contact lines with the adjacent

circumferential surfaces situated opposite the roller axis/axes (34) at a distance

therefrom.
Conveyor according to claim 1, characterised in that the inner and the outer rollers
(35, 36) have a common roller axis (34) and the mating surfaces (39, 43, 42, 52)

for the circumferential surfaces (37, 38) are vertically offset relative to one
another by the amount of the roller diameter (d).
Conveyor according to claim 1 or claim 2, characterised in that stop parts (40, 41)
for the inner rollers (35) having the mating surfaces (39, 42) are formed by

longitudinal profiles extending along the supporting structure (17).
Conveyor according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that a flanged socket
(67) with a connecting sleeve (70) embracing the shaft (64) towards the outside is

connected to the end of the deflecting roller (62) with a larger diameter, the 
flanged socket forming a stop surface (67) for the rollers (48) with a

circumferential surface (49) perpendicular to the conveyor belt (10) and the
connecting sleeve forming a running surface (71) for the other rollers (35, 36)

with a circumferential surface (37, 38) parallel to the belt.
Conveyor according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the
circumferential surfaces (49) of the rollers (48) of the tight side (10h)

perpendicular to the conveyor belt (10) bear against the outside of a partition wall
(24) of the supporting structure (17) and the circumferential surfaces of these

rollers are guided on the slack side (10t) along an inclined running surface (51) of
the partition wall, the partition wall (24) optionally extending close and parallel to

an outer side wall (12) of the supporting structure (17).
Conveyor according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterised by webs (26)
connecting the partition wall (24) and the outer supporting structure (17), on and

below which the longitudinal profiles (40, 41) are mounted.
Conveyor with a horizontal underside of a stop part for the outer rollers according
to one of claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the outer rollers (36) with

circumferential surfaces (38) parallel to the belt are embraced in the region of the
tight side (10h) by a guide plate (44) of the supporting structure (17) and bear

against the underside (43) thereof, wherein the circumferential surfaces (38) of the
outer rollers (36) substantially parallel to the belt can optionally roll on an inclined

surface (52) of a profiled bar (53) in the region of the slack side (10t).
Conveyor with a deflecting roller in the form of a drive roller according to at least
one of claims 1 to 7, characterised in that a drive shaft (64) of the deflecting roller

serving as a drive roller (62) for the conveyor belt (10) is connected by means of a
line drive (75) to a drive motor (78), in particular a spur-gear motor.
Conveyor according to claim 8, characterised in that the drive is effected non-positively
by means of a drive belt serving as a line drive (75) or that the line

drive (75) is an endless chain drive mounted on gears (74, 76). 
Conveyor according to one of claims 1 to 9, characterised in that the shaft (64) of
the drive roller or deflecting roller (62) is inclined towards the outside of the curve

at an acute angle corresponding to the increase in the cross section thereof.
Conveyor according to one of claims 1 to 10, characterised by base plates (20)
tapering towards the inside of the supporting structure (16) serving as supports for

the tight side (10h) of the conveyor belt (10), the base plates tapering towards an
inner side wall (11) between the partition wall (24) and the said inner side wall

when viewed from above.
