<DESCRIPTION>
European Patent 13,376 discloses N-(4-trifluoromethylphenyl)-5-methylisoxazole-4-carboxamide
(compound 1) as being anti-inflammatory.
Processes for the preparation of this compound are also described therein.It is additionally known that the compound 1 and N-(4-trifluoromethylphenyl)-2-cyano-3-hydroxycrotonamide
(compound 2) have immunomodulation properties,
so that they are suitable as pharmaceutical against chronic graft versus host
diseases and against autoimmune disorders, in particular systemic lupus
erythematosus (EP 0,217,206).US 4,061, 767 describes the use of 2-hydroxyethylidene-cyanoacetanilide
derivatives for the preparation of a pharmaceutical having anti-inflammatory and
analgesic action.WO 91/17748 discloses the use of isoxazole-4-carboxamide derivatives and
hydroxyalkylidene-cyanoacetamide derivatives for the treatment of cancer
diseases. The action of leflunomide on dermal delayed-type hypersensitivity is
described in P. Hambleton and S. McMahon (Agents and Actions, Vol. 29 (3/4),
1990, pages 328-332). The inhibition of the autophosphorylation of the
epidermal growth factor receptor by leflunomide is disclosed by R.R. Bartlett et
al. (Agents and Actions, Vol 32 ½, 1991, pages 10-21). The inhibition of
epidermal growth factor-receptor tyrosine-specific kinase by leflunomide is
disclosed by T. Mattar et al. (FASEB, Vol. 4(7), 1990, page A 2207). A.
Levitzki and C. Gilon describe tyrphostins as molecular tools and potential
antiproliferative drugs (Trends in Pharmaceutical Sciences,Vol. 12(5), 1991,
pages 171-174). EP 0 257 882 discloses the use of N-phenylbutenamides in
the treatment of allergic skin diseases, ectopic and atopic eczemas or psoriasis.
EP 0 217 206 discloses the use of leflunomide for the treatment of chronic
graft versus host disease and systemic lupus erythematodes. Psoriasis is a special form of skin disorder characterized by the development of
reddish plaques, which tend to be dry and scaly. Psoriasis occurs most
frequently in adults. Manifestations of psoriasis range from a few lesions to
widespread disease. Psoriatic lesions are caused by abnormally increased
epidermal cell proliferation, e.g., proliferation of keratinocytes is enhanced. The
disease causes exfoliation which, although unsightly and emotionally stressful,
rarely compromises general health. In the U.S. in 1992 it is estimated that
between 4 and 8 million people are affected with psoriasis. About 200,000
new cases of the disease are diagnosed annually. Psoriasis is a global problem;
it has been reported

b) (C₃-C₆)-cycloalkyl, 
c) (C₂-C₆)-alkyl, having at least 1 double or triple bond between the 
carbon atoms, 
 
R² denotes 


a) -CF₃ or 
b) -CN, 
 
R³ denotes 


a) (C₁-C₄)-alkyl or 
b) hydrogen atom, 

 
X denotes 


a) -CH- group or 
b) nitrogen atom 
 
where the compound of the formula II is present as such or in the form of a 

physiologically tolerable salt. 
The method of claim 1, wherein the compound of the formula I or II is 
selected from the group consisting of 

R¹ denotes 

a) methyl, 
b) cyclopropyl or 
c) -CH₂-CH₂-C≡CH, 
 
R² denotes -CF₃, 

R³ denotes methyl or hydrogen atom and 
X denotes -CH- group.

keratinocytes which comprises inhibiting said proliferation by administering to a 

patient in need of such treatment an effective amount of a pharmaceutical 
composition containing as an active ingredient a compound of the formula I or II 

as defined in claim 1. 
The method of claim 8, wherein said skin disorder is selected from the 
group consisting of psoriasis, psoriasis vulgaris, psoriasis eruptive, psoriasis 

erythrodermic, psoriasis pustular, dermatitis, dermatitis atopica, dermatitis 
allergica, dermatitis photoallergica, dermatitis medicamentosa and eczema. 
The method of claim 8, wherein said composition is administered 
intravenously, orally, topically, or parenterally.
