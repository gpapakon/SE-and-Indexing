<ABSTRACT>
In a process for shaping the end of a 
tube (2) with an oblong cross-section to a 

circular cross-section the shaping occurs in a 
single radial compression stage from the exterior. 

The tube (2) is disposed with its shortest axis in 
correspondence with two fixed opposite surfaces 

(12, 14), having a circular profile with a radius 
of curvature (R) which is approximately equal to 

the radius of the circular section of the tube 
which is to be obtained. A radial compression is 

then exerted along the longest axis of the oblong 
section of the non-deformed tube by a pair of 

shaping surfaces (22, 24) having an angular 
extension which is complementary to those of the 

fixed opposite surfaces (12, 14).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a
process and a device for shaping the end of a tube with an
oblong cross-section, in particular with a flat
section, to a circular cross-section, in which
shaping occurs in a single stage of radial
compression from the exterior according to the
preambles of claims 1 and 2 respectively.Processes of this type are used in the
construction of so-called mechanical assembly-type
heat exchangers in which an array of tubes
having oblong cross-sections (this term is
intended to cover flat, oval, ovoid and similar
cross-sections) are fixed to a stack of sheets by
radial expansion of the tubes. Subsequently, the
ends of the tubes are shaped along a circular
cross-section and these ends are inserted in
corresponding holes in a base plate. The tubes
are fixed to the base plate by radial expansion
which brings the outer wall of each tube into
contact with an elastomeric sealing collar.The rounding process for the end of a
tube having a cross-section which is not circular
should produce a deformation which is as regular 
as possible since the deformed part should be able
to come into contact with the sealing element.In addition to the uniformity of the
section obtained by the plastic deformation, it is
necessary for the outer surface of the deformed
zone to be completely free of scoring and to be
perfectly smooth, in order to avoid micro-losses
between the tube and the seal even after the
exchanger has been operating for several hours.The present invention relates
specifically to a process and a device in which shaping is
performed in a single radial compression stage
from the exterior. The conventional method of
shaping the tube acting exclusively on its outer
surface provides for the use of two jaws with a
semi-circular profile which act along the longest
axis of the cross-section of the tube.
This is the case of FR-A-2 474 674, which shows a method and a
device according to the preambles of claims 1 and 2.
The
disadvantage of this process is that there is a
risk of producing distinct pinched areas on the
exterior of the tube or, at best, scoring which is
more or less deep. This occurs since, in the
absence of an internal guide in the tube during
the deformation process (which can be a punch
which perfectly matches its internal diameter once
deformed), it is very difficult to centre the tube
on the device and to force the tube to be deformed 
in a regular and uniform manner along the entire
perimeter of the section.In fact, it is very easy for one wall of
the tube to yield before
