<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to polyimides incorporating 
repeating units, derived from the dianhydride 
5-(2,5-dioxo-tetrahydrofuryl) -3-methyl-3-cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylic 
anhydride and various aromatic diamines. U.S. 4,240,914; U.S. 4,358,378; U.S. 4,385,084 and 
U.S. 4,410,568 disclose asymmetric polyimide gas separation membranes 
prepared from an aliphatic polyimide material. Said aliphatic polyimide 
material is compositionally different from that described herein. U.S. Re 30,351; U.S. 3,822,202 and U.S. 3,899,309 disclose gas 
separation membrane materials comprising certain semirigid aromatic 
polyimides, polyamides and polyesters. U.S. 4,307,135 discloses the preparation of an asymmetric 
polyimide membrane from a soluble polyimide. U.S. 4,378,324; U.S. 4,460,526; U.S. 4,485,056 and 
U.S. 4,512,893 disclose a process for preparing asymmetric polyimide 
membranes. U.S. 4,690,873 discloses an aromatic polyimide gas separation 
membrane material. The present invention relates to novel polyimide gas separation 
membranes prepared therefrom, and the separation of at least one gas 
from a mixture of gases using such membranes. The polyimides are 
polymers or copolymers derived from dianhydrides and aromatic 
diamines wherein at least one repeating unit contains 
5-(2,5-dioo-tetrahydrofuryl)-3-methyl-3,3-cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylic 
anhydride. Preferably, at least about 10 mole percent and most 
preferably at least about 50 mole percent of the dianhydride residues are 
derived from 5-(2,5-dioo-tetrahydrofuryl)-3-methyl-3,3-cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylic  
 
anhydride, which has the following structural formula: 
These polyimides exhibit superior permselectivity with respect 
to several gaseous mixtures and particularly with respect to the mixture of 
nitrogen and oxygen as found in the atmosphere. The separation of one or more gases from a complex 
multicomponent mixture of gases has been found to be necessary in a 
large number of industries. Such separations currently are undertaken 
commercially by such processes as cryogenics, pressure swing adsorption 
and membrane separations. In certain of the separations, membrane 
separations have been found to be economically more viable than other 
processes. In a gas separation process, one side of the membrane is 
contacted with a multicomponent gas mixture and certain of the gases of 
said mixture permeate through the membrane faster than the other gases. 
Gas separation membranes are semipermeable. They allow for some 
gases to permeate through them
