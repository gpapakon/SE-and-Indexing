<ABSTRACT>
A system for real-time digital signal processing employs 
a single-chip microcomputer device having separate on-chip 

program and data memory, with separate address and data 
paths for program and data. An external program address bus 

allows off-chip program fetch in an expansion mode, with the 
opcode returned by an external data bus. A bus interchange 

module allows transfer between the separate internal program 
and data busses in special circumstances. The internal 

busses are 16-bit, while the ALU and accumulator are 32-bit. 
A multiplier circuit produces a single state 16x16 multiply 

function separate from the ALU, with 32-bit output to the 
ALU. One input to the ALU passes through a 0-to-15 bit 

shifter with sign extension. 
The on-chip program memory may be a RAM and this 
additional RAM may be configured as either program or data 

memory space. The the processor may operate with all 
off-chip program memory and a large on-chip data memory, or 

with program execution from on-chip RAM (downloaded from 
off-chip program memory) using a block move instruction. A 

repeat instruction is used to save program space when using 
block-move, or multiply instructions as needed for digital 

filters or the like.

in U.S. Pat. 4,491,910, issued Jan. 1, 1985, to Caudel, Magar 

and Leigh, assigned to Texas Instruments, where the background 
and prior art are discussed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to microcomputer devices, and
especially to the moving of blocks of data within a memory
space of such a device.It is the principal object to this invention to
provide improved features of a microcomputer device and
system, particularly one adapted for real-time digital
signal processing or the like. Another object is to provide
a high-speeed microcomputer of enhanced capabilities.The invention provides a microcomputer device
responsive to instruction words selected from an
instruction set and stored within an addressable memory
space, said device being formed in a single integrated
circuit and having data input and output terminals and
address output terminals, the device comprising within
said integrated circuit: an arithmetic logic unit having a
data input and a data output, a control circuit responsive
to said stored instruction words having outputs connected
to said arithmetic logic unit, the control circuit
generating micro-control signals on said output to cause
said arithmetic logic unit to execute instructions
represented by the instruction words, a read/write data
memory forming part of said memory space and having an
address input and data input and output, a program memory
forming part of said memory space and having an address
input and at least a program output, and internal data and
address buses interconnecting said arithmetic logic unit,
said control circuit and said memories and coupled to said
data input and output terminals and said address output
terminals, characterised in that said instruction set
includes a move instruction word, and said control circuit
includes a repeat counter and is arranged such that the
move instruction is executed by said control circuit a
number of times defined by the number stored in said repeat
counter which is decremented with each execution of the
move instruction, whereby said move instruction word causes
the transfer of a block of data in locations starting at a
first address of said memory space to locations starting at 
a second address of said memory space, the number of items
of data in said block being defined by the number stored in
said repeat counter.In accordance with one embodiment, features of the
invention are included in a system for real-time digital
signal processing which employs a single-chip microcomputer
device having separate on-chip program ROM and data RAM,
with separate address and data paths for program and data.
An external program address bus allows off-chip program
fetch in an expansion mode, with
