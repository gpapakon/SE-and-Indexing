<ABSTRACT>
A microphone mask to be worn in front of the mouth of an underwater diver has a microphone assembly and a teethpiece assembly mounted in a rubber waterproof enclosure (14). The enclosure has an air passage (16) extending from an inlet opening (18) to a rear outlet opening. The teethpiece assembly includes a plastic insert with a vertical plate mounted in the enclosure. The vertical plate has openings for the air passage as well as to allow sound to travel from the diver's mouth to the microphone assembly (32). A teeth member (38) extends rearwardly out of the outlet opening into the diver's mouth where it is held between the diver's teeth. The teeth member is connected to the insert by resilient spring members (40) which draw the enclosure rearwardly against the diver's face. There is a sealing surface around the outlet opening, and this seals it around the outside of the diver's mouth. This eliminates the need for a headband and facilitates the use of the microphone mask for the combination of breathing and speaking.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to underwater 
diving apparatus and more particularily to a mouth mask to 
accommodate a microphone for underwater communication. In the past, it has been well known to mount a 
diver's respirator on a mouthpiece which has teethpieces 
which are engaged between the diver's teeth to hold it in 
place. However, both the mouthpiece and the teethpieces 
are in the diver's mouth, and the waterproof seal is 
between the mouthpiece and the inside of the diver's lips. 
An example of this is seen in U.S. Patent Number 4,304,229 
to Curtin. A similar arrangement providing for underwater 
communication between two divers is shown in European 
Patent Publication No. 0 122 878 to Gross filed April 2, 
1984. Disadvantages of this arrangement are that it is 
difficult to speak with the mouthpiece in the mouth and the 
air supply is interrupted if the mouthpiece is taken out of 
the mouth. US-A-3 347 230 shows a microphone mask according to the first part of claim 1. It is also known to provide a diver's mask with 
a microphone which is held in place in front of the diver's 
mouth by an elastic headstrap which extends around the back 
of the head of the diver. One example of this is shown in 
the Divecomm Model USC - 101 Communicator brochure. While 
this provides improved communication, the position of the 
headstrap is uncomfortable and it is inconvenient, 
particularly in association with another mask to cover the 
eyes. The present invention as defined by claim 1 
provides a diver's 
microphone mask to be worn in front of the diver's mouth 
with a teethpiece assembly which retracts the mask to  
 
provide a waterproof seal against the diver's face without 
requiring a headstrap. The microphone mask comprises a 
hollow waterproof enclosure with an air passage extending 
therethrough from an inlet opening connectable to an air 
supply and an outlet opening extending rearwardly to the 
diver's mouth. The enclosure also has a sealing surface 
which extends around the outlet opening and is shaped to 
sealingly fit against the diver's face around the diver's 
mouth. A microphone assembly is mounted in the enclosure 
to transmit a signal from sound received from the diver's 
mouth. A teethpiece assembly attached to the enclosure 
extends rearwardly into the mouth of the diver to be 
engaged by the diver's teeth. The teethpiece assembly is 
sufficiently resilient to retract the enclosure against the 
face of the diver with sufficient force whereby the 
enclosure is retained in place and the
