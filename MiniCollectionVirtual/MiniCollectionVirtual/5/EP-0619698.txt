<ABSTRACT>
A packaging system (18) is disclosed for storing and 
handling electrical connectors (30) and the like. The 

system employs a plurality of elongated connector-containing 
tubes (20a-20d). Each tube has an aperture (12, 

26) therethrough near each opposite end thereof. The 
apertures are spaced longitudinally of the respective tubes 

so that a pair of assembly rods (16) can be passed through 
the aligned apertures of a plurality of generally parallel 

juxtaposed tubes. The assembly rods hold the tubes in a 
generally stacked array and also act as stop rods to close-off 

the ends of the tubes. At least one aperture (26) in 
each tube (20a-20d) is enlarged relative to the rod passing 

therethrough for accommodating any variances in the spacing 
between the apertures in any particular tubes.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to the art of 
electrical connectors and, particularly, to a packaging 
system for storing and handling electrical connectors, or 
the like, by employing connector-containing storage tubes. During the manufacture of electrical connectors, 
integrated circuits and other electrical or electronic 
devices, the devices are stored in and transferred to and 
from various types of equipment for carrying out different 
manufacturing or assembling steps. For instance, the 
devices may be assembled, tested, inspected, and the like, 
during which the devices are stored, protected and handled 
in protective storage tubes between various manufacturing 
processes or machines. Most such tubes are fabricated of 
extruded plastic material, but the tubes may be made of 
metal or other appropriate material. A "rack" of the tubes 
may be loaded into a "magazine" of an assembly machine, 
with the devices being dispensed seriatim from each 
individual tube, whereafter the tube is discarded for 
dispensing devices from the successive tube in the rack. As an example, only, such storage tubes may hold 
as many as twenty-five or more electrical devices for 
handling during manufacture. When processing is complete, 
the devices also may be shipped to customers in the tubes. 
A very large electronic manufacturer may process thousands 
and thousands of electronic devices in any given lot. For  
 
every one-thousand electronic devices, forty storage tubes 
are used. A plurality of the tubes normally are stored in 
a bulk container or tote box which is transferred, along 
with the related paperwork, between separate manufacturing 
processes or to the customer. Heretofore, one packaging system has utilized a 
pair of elongated stop rods for holding the electronic 
devices in their respective tubes, and to hold a plurality 
of the tubes for conjoint manual manipulation. More 
particularly, each tube is provided with an aperture 
therethrough near each opposite end thereof. When a "rack" 
of tubes are assembled with a plurality of tubes in a 
generally parallel juxtaposition, the stop rods are 
inserted through the aligned apertures of all of the tubes 
in the rack to close-off the ends of the tubes and to allow 
for manual handling of an entire rack of tubes 
interconnected by the rods. Heretofore, after the electronic devices have 
been completely processed or finally used by a customer, 
the storage tubes have been discarded. In other words, the 
tubes have been considered as disposable items.

<CLAIMS>
A packaging system (18) for storing and 
handling electrical components (30), including a plurality 

of elongated component-containing tubes (20a-20d), each 
tube having an aperture (12, 26) therethrough near each 

opposite end thereof, the apertures being spaced 
longitudinally of the respective tubes, and a pair of 

assembly rods (16) passed through aligned apertures 
(12, 26) of a plurality of generally parallel juxtaposed 

tubes to hold the tubes in a generally stacked array, 
characterised in that at least one aperture 

(26) in each tube (20a-20d) is enlarged relative to the 
rod (16) passing therethrough for accommodating any 

variations in the spacing between the apertures in any 
particular tubes. 
A packaging system as set forth in claim 
1, wherein said at least one aperture in each tube (20a-20d) 

comprises an elongated slot (26) extending 
longitudinally of the tube.
