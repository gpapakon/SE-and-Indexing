<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a carrier for
electrophotography which composes a two-component type
developer used to develop an electrostatic image in
electrophotography, electrostatic recording or
electrostatic printing. It also relates to a two-component
type developer making use of the carrier,
and an image forming method carried out using the two-component
type developer.It is conventionally known to form an image on
the surface of a photoconductive material by an
electrostatic means.A large number of methods are known as electro-photography,
as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 2,297,691
Japanese Patent Publications No. 42-23910 and No. 43-24748
and so forth. In general, an electrostatic
latent image is formed on a photosensitive member,
utilizing a photoconductive material and according to
various means, and subsequently a very finely divided
electrodetective material called a toner is made to
adhere to the latent image to form a toner image 
corresponding to the electrostatic latent image.Next, the toner image is transferred to an
image holding medium such as paper if necessary,
followed by fixing by the action of heat, pressure, or
solvent vapor. A copy is thus obtained. When the
process comprises a toner-image transfer step, the
process is usually provided with the step of removing
the toner remaining on the photosensitive member.As developing methods by which the
electrostatic latent image is formed into a visible
image by the use of a toner, known methods can be
exemplified by the powder cloud development as
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 2,221,776, the cascade
development as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 2,618,552,
the magnetic brush development as disclosed in U.S.
Patent No. 2,874,063, and the method in which a
conductive magnetic toner is used, as disclosed in
U.S. Patent No. 3,909,258, as well as what is called
the J/B development as disclosed in Japanese Patent
Application Laid-open No. 62-63970, in which a bias
electric field comprised of an AC component and a DC
component is applied across a developer carrying
member (a developing sleeve) and a photoconductive
layer to carry out development.Among these, the magnetic brush development
can be noted as a representative process. In this
process, magnetic particles such as steel powder or 
ferrite powder are used as a carrier, and a developer
comprised of a toner and such a magnetic carrier is
held with a magnet so that the developer is arranged
in the form of a brush by the action of a magnetic
field of the magnet. The magnetic brush thus
