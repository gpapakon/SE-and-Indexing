<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to apparatuses and
methods for measuring and controlling the amount of
multiple coating materials applied to a substrate,
and in particular to an apparatus and method for
monitoring and regulating the basis weight of
multiple coating materials containing different
compositions applied to a paper sheet, such as
paperboard.It is often desirable to coat paperboard with
different types of coating materials to make a white
printable surface. Although the paperboard can be
coated with a wide variety of materials, it is often
first coated with a base coat, which may be composed
of a paint-like substance of principally calcium
carbonate (CaCO3), a latex binder and possibly some
clay. A top coat is then applied which may be
composed of principally clay, a latex binder and
possibly some CaCO3. Both the CaCO3 and clay serve as
white pigments. CaCO3 is the less expensive pigment,
but does not enhance the printability of the
paperboard as well as clay. Therefore, CaCO3 is
preferred as the principal component of the base coat
and clay is preferred as the principal component of
the top coat on which the printing takes place. The
coatings provide a white surface for packaging boxes,
such as cereal boxes, shoe boxes, and the like.
Alternatively, or in addition, such coatings also may
be intended to render paperboard waterproof.These coatings may be applied to the paperboard
as part of the papermaking process in a paper mill.
Alternatively, previously manufactured paperboard may
be supplied from large rolls of paperboard to 
separate coating machines, called "coaters." In
either process, the uncoated paperboard is usually
fed sequentially to the coaters in sheets that are 15
feet or more in their "cross-directional" width
(i.e., the direction transverse to the direction of
movement of the paper through the paperboard
machinery).It is often desirable to apply a uniform "basis
weight" (i.e., mass of the coating material on a unit
of surface area of the sheet) of coating to the
substrate. For example, the printability of
paperboard is improved by a uniform layer of gloss
coating which may include relatively expensive
materials, such as latex and/or TiO2. Of course, a
uniform coating layer avoids wasting such materials.
In some processes, the uniformity of the coatings
should be controlled to a fraction of a gram/m2.Various complex coaters have been designed to
handle the relatively large cross-directional width
of paperboard and the requirement for a uniform
coating. One type of coater, a blade
