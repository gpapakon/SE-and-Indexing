<ABSTRACT>
An illustrative embodiment of such a franking machine includes:   - a calendar circuit (CAL) which supplies the actual date and is protected so as to prevent unauthorised modification of the date;   - non-volatile memories (BAM1, BAM2); - means (M1, RM) for calculating the daily consumption and for registering it into the memories together with the actual date supplied by the calendar circuit, at least once each day for which at least one franking operation has been carried out.

A method of checking daily consumption of postal charges by a 
postage meter, the method comprising the following steps: 


recording cumulative data in a non-volatile memory (BAM1, BAM2) of the 
postage meter after each day on which the postage meter has performed at 

least one franking operation, said data being representative of total 
consumption of postal charges metered by the meter up to said day, and 

being recorded in association with a date provided by a calendar circuit 
(CAL) of the meter; 
maintaining a series of such cumulative data in correspondence with 
respective dates in the non-volatile memory of the postage meter over a 

predetermined period of time; 
recovering daily consumption values and corresponding dates from the 
postage meter on the basis of said cumulative data recorded in its non-volatile 

memory in association with said dates, each daily consumption 
value representing the consumption of postage charges metered by the 

meter for one day's use of the meter; 
recovering from the postage meter, a certification number calculated by 
applying a calculation algorith to said 
recovered daily consumption values, 
said cumulative data recorded over said period of time in the non-volatile 

memory, an encoding key, and an identification number of the postage 
meter previously recorded in the memory of the postage meter; 
noting said cumulative data, daily consumption values, identification 
number of the postage meter, and certification number on a billing form for 

said predetermined period of time; and 
after said billing form has been drawn up, recalculating a new certification 
number on the basis of the cumulative data, the daily consumption values, 

the identification number of the meter marked on the form and an encoding 
key identical to that recorded in the postage meter in order to verify whether 

the certification number remarked on the form is identical to the new 
certification number calculated in this way. 
The method according to claim 1, including displaying on a 
display screen (D) provided on the postage meter, said cumulative data, 

said daily consumption values in association with dates, the identification 
number of the postage meter, and said calculated certification number.  

 
The method according to one of claims 1 or 2, including 
automatically transferring the cumulative data, the daily franking 

consumption values, the identification number of the postage meter, and the 
certification number on a billing form by means of a printer (P) connected to 

the postage meter. 
A postage meter adapted to implementing the method of 
checking postal charge consumption according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 

comprising, inside an enclosure (EN) protected against unauthorized 
access: means (M1, RM) for metering total consumption of postal charges 

representative of franking operations performed by said meter since said 
meter was switched on, and for maintaining cumulative data representative 

of said total consumption in a non-volatile memory (BAM1, BAM2), a 
calendar circuit (CAL) for delivering a date to said metering means on 

demand, means (M1, MR) for writing such cumulative data in the non-volatile 
memory in correspondence with dates provided by the calendar 

circuit for each day on which at least one franking operation is performed by 
the postage meter, calculation means (M1, RM) for calculating daily 

consumption values from said cumulative data and for calculating a 
certification number representative of a combination of said cumulative data 

recorded in the non-volatile memory, of the calculated daily consumption 
values, of an identification number, and of a code key recorded in the 

memory of the meter, and means (D, P) for playing back to a user of the 
meter, said cumulative data, the identification number of the calculated daily 

consumption values, and the calculated certification number for the purpose 
of being marked on a billing form. 
A meter according to claim 4, comprising a keypad (K) for 
causing the calculation means (M1, RM) to change the date in the calendar 

circuit (CAL) or to change the cumulative data in the non-volatile memory 
(BAM1, BAM2). 
A meter according to claim 5, including a switch (S) placed in a 
zone (T) of the enclosure (EN) that is accessible via a sealed hatch and that 

is connected to the calculation means (M1, RM).
