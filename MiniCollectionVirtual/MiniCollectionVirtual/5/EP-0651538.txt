<ABSTRACT>
An interface for pulse width modulation communications 
(PWM) for a motor vehicle, based on the use of inverting 

logic gates (N, N1, N2) to exploit the logic level 
limiting effect (clamp) in association with low-pass 

filters (R1, R2, C1; R3, C2; R4, C3) of the RC type. The 
interface permits the use of a single signal wire without 

a dedicated ground wire, and a good immunity against 
electromagnetic disturbances (EMI).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to an interface 
for transmission of pulse width modulated analogue 
communication signals, and more specifically relates to 
an interface of this type particularly, although not 
exclusively, developed for automobile use. Prior art interfaces for pulse width modulation 
communications, and in particular interfaces forming part 
of systems intended to operate in electromagnetically 
disturbed environments, typically use two wires for the 
communication. Of these wires one is used to transmit 
the signal itself whilst the other is utilised as a 
specific ground wire, that is to say it is dedicated to 
the wire used for the transmission of the signal. The 
dedicated ground wire makes it possible to obtain a good 
immunity against electromagnetic disturbances (also 
called EMI) thus making the communication reliable 
although having the obvious disadvantage of increasing 
the cost and complexity of the system as a whole. The object of the present invention is that of providing 
an interface system which makes it possible to resolve 
all the above-indicated problems in a satisfactory 
manner. According to the present invention this object is  
 
achieved thanks to an interface system having the 
characteristics indicated in the claims which follow the 
present description. Further advantages and characteristics of the present 
invention will become apparent from the following 
detailed description in which reference is made to the 
attached drawings, provided purely by way of non-limitative 
example, in which: 
Figure 1 is a schematic circuit representation of a first 
portion of the system according to the present invention; Figure 2 is a schematic circuit representation of a 
second portion of the system according to the present 
invention; and Figure 3 is a schematic circuit representation of an 
alternative embodiment of the portion of the system 
shown in Figure 2. As can be seen from Figures 1 and 2 the interface system 
is very simple in its conception. In Figure 1 a 
transmitter unit TR is shown. It comprises a logic gate of inverting type (commonly 
called a NOT gate) N which receives at an input terminal 
MP signals from a microprocessor (not illustrated). At 
the output of the inverting gate N is positioned a simple 
RC network formed by two resistors R1 and R2 connected in 
series and a capacitor C1 connected in parallel, that is  
 
to say connected between the common node between the 
resistors R1 and R2 and ground GND. This RC network is 
essentially a
