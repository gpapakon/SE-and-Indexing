<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a crosstalk detector (101 ∼ 105) for 
detecting a quantity of crosstalk of signals optically read 

from a recording medium having a plurality of tracks for 
memorizing information. Where crosstalk detecting signals 

different from each other are recorded at positions in 
correspondence with each other on the normal with respect to 

the tracks between adjacent tracks on the recording medium, 
the detector comprises means (101, 102, 103) for comparing 

read signal levels between adjacent tracks at the positions 
where the crosstalk detecting signals are recorded to 

thereby calculate a quantity of crosstalk of the read 
signals. Further, where crosstalk detecting signals are 

recorded at positions which are not in correspondence with 
each other on the normal with respect to the tracks between 

adjacent tracks, the detector comprises means (104, 105) for 
comparing read signal levels between adjacent tracks at the 

positions where the crosstalk signals included in the read 
signals are recorded to thereby calculate a quantity of 

crosstalk of the read signals.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a crosstalk quantity 
detector, and more particulary to a device for detecting a 
crosstalk quantity of signals optically read from a 
recording medium (e.g., optical disk,etc.,) having a 
plurarity of tracks for recording information. Hitherto, in optical disks such as laser video disks 
(LVD) etc., there is employed a so-called track structure 
such that signal bit trains are arranged in a spiral manner 
from the inner circumferential side of the optical disk 
toward the outer circumferential side thereof to record 
information. In such optical disks of the track structure, 
there is the problem of crosstalk that record information on 
a track adjacent to a track presently traced is mixed into a 
read signal for the track presently traced. As the cause of 
occurrence of crosstalk, it is pointed out that the 
following phenomenon would occur. Namely, the diameter of a 
spot of a laser beam for reading is definite. For this 
reason, in accordance with the relationship between the spot 
diameter and the interval between adjacent tracks, e.g., in 
such cases where the disk is tilted or inclined, when the 
laser beam deviates (positionally shifts) from the position 
of an object or a target track and is irradiated onto a 
track adjacent thereto, that laser beam may read record  
 
information on the adjacent track together with record 
information on the object track. As the method of detecting such a crosstalk, there is 
conventionally known a method of detecting an inclination or 
tilt to indirectly detect a quantity of crosstalk. This conventional crosstalk detecting method is shown in 
FIGS. 11 (A) and 11 (B). Namely, a light from a light 
emitting element 31 such as a light emitting diode, etc., is 
irradiated onto a disk 34 to receive a reflected light by 
two light receiving elements 32 and 33 arranged on the both 
side of the light emitting element 31 to compare output 
signal levels of the both light receiving elements 32 and 33 
by a differential amplifier 35 to detect a tilt or 
inclination of the optical disk 34, thus to detect a 
quantity of crosstalk in dependency upon the degree of the 
tilt. Namely, in the case where the light emitting element 31 
and the light receiving elements 32 and 33 correctly face 
the optical disk 34 as shown in FIG. 11 (A), since 
quantities of light received by the light receiving elements 
32 and 33 are the same, the output of the differential 
amplifier 35 is equal to zero. In contrast, in the case 
where the optical disk 34 is
