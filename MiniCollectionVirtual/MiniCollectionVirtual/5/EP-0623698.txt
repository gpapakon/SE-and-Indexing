<ABSTRACT>
Telescoping slot nozzles (10) for use with a rail assembly (45) are 
disclosed. Each nozzle includes a fixed portion (5) and at least one 

telescoping portions (12) slidably guided in the fixed portion. 
Metal-to-metal contact in the nozzle is avoided, thereby allowing 

the nozzles to operate at high temperatures. The configuration 
of the nozzle discharge opening (6,6') can be easily modified to form 

an air knife, depending upon the particular application. Each 
nozzle is independent of the others, thereby facilitating 

retrofitting existing ovens and maintenance of individual 
nozzles.

<DESCRIPTION>
In the production of oriented film for example, the
film web is transported through an oven that will heat and/or
cool the web. A typical oven consists of slot nozzles which
provide convective heat transfer by air impinging on the web,
and mechanical means (such as a tenter) for transporting and
stretching the web. The tenter consists of clips that clamp
to the edge of the web and rails that guide the clips through
the oven. The distance between rails is typically adjustable
to allow for the production of different width webs and
different stretch rates.In order to allow for the adjustment of the rails
depending on the film web width, the slot nozzles, which are
arranged on either side of the plane of travel of the web,
are positioned above and below the rails. As a result of the
rails between the sets of nozzles, nozzle-to-web distances
are not at the optimum, sometimes being as much as 41 cm (16
inches) apart. As the nozzle-to-web distance increases, the
heat transfer coefficient and uniformity decrease, thereby
resulting in an inefficient oven and poorer quality film.In response to problems similar to the foregoing, US-A-2270155
and US-A-2495163 disclose the use of nozzles having
variable lengths according to the width of a cloth being
treated. The nozzles include a fixed part corresponding to
the minimum width of the cloth to be treated, and end
extensions slidably mounted on the fixed part, which are
responsive to the movements of the chain guide rails. As a
result, the nozzles need not be located above and below the
top and bottom rails, respectively, 
but instead can be located in the same planes as the rails.The present invention is directed to an improved
telescoping slot nozzle for tenter frames as hereinafter
described.The problems of the prior art have been solved by the
present invention, which provides telescoping slot nozzles
for use with a rail assembly.The present invention provides a telescoping nozzle
characterised by the features of claim 1.The configuration of the nozzle discharge opening can
be easily modified to form an air knife, depending upon the
particular application. Each nozzle is independent of the
others, thereby facilitating retrofitting existing ovens and
maintenance of individual nozzles.Figure 1 is a front cross-sectional view of a telescoping
nozzle in accordance with a first embodiment of the
present invention;Figure la is an enlarged view of the portion of figure
1 encircled;Figure 2 is a side view of the telescoping nozzle of

<CLAIMS>
A telescoping nozzle for heating, cooling or
drying a web (99), comprising a fixed nozzle-defining portion

(5, 6, 6') and a slidable exterior telescoping portion (12,
16, 16') characterized in that


(a) said fixed portion is defined by a substantially
centrally located inner channel member (5) fixed

relative to a pair of side channel plates (6, 6') and a top
slot plate (3) on said inner channel member, said top slot plate

(3) defining with each of said side channel plates (6,6') a pair of
fixed discharge gaps (30, 30'); and in that
(b) said telescoping portion is defined by a
sliding exterior channel member (12) dimensioned to slide

about said inner channel member (5), and a pair of sliding
exterior extension plates (16, 16') fixed relative to said

sliding exterior channel member (12), and dimensioned to
slide about a respective said side channel plate (6 or 6'),

said exterior channel member (12) defining with each of said
extension plates (16, 16') an air discharge slot at the

telescoping portion.
The telescoping nozzle of claim 1, wherein said
sliding exterior channel member (12) comprises at least one

guide shaft (17), and wherein said inner channel member (5)
comprises at least one guide shaft-receiving member (8) for

slidingly receiving said guide shaft (17), thereby allowing
said telescoping portion (12, 16, 16')to slide within said

fixed portion (5, 6, 6').
The telescoping nozzle of claim 1 or claim 2,
wherein said sliding exterior channel member (12), said inner

channel member (5), said exterior extension channel plates
(16, 16') and said side channel plates (6, 6') are formed of

metal, and further comprising means between said exterior
channel member (12) and said inner channel member (5), and

between said exterior extension plates (16, 16') and said
side channel plates (6, 6') to eliminate metal-to-metal

contact. 
The telescoping nozzle of any one of claims 1 to
3, characterized in that said side channel plates (6, 6') are

coupled to said inner channel member (5) by a stiffener base
(7).
The telescoping nozzle of any one of claims 1 to
4, characterized in that at least one of said fixed (30, 30')

and one of said telescoping discharge gaps are shaped to form
an air knife.
A tenter system in a housing, comprising a rail
assembly (45) having a plurality of clips for securing to a

web and guiding said web through said housing; characterized
by a plurality of telescoping slot nozzles (10) according to

any one of claims 1 to 5 removably affixed to said rail
assembly.
The tenter system of claim 6, characterized in
that each of said slot nozzles is independent of the others.
