<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to three-dimensional image generation using a variety of
types of interrogating radiation, including electromagnetic, particle and acoustic radiation.
In particular, it finds application in the processing of images produced with X-rays.In PCT application No. 92/20032 there is disclosed a method of generating images
of a specimen containing at least two regions of different opacity to the passage of
radiation comprising irradiating said specimen with radiation from a radiation source;
detecting the amplitude of the radiation passing through said specimen from different
directions; these amplitudes are processed to derive further signal indicative of contours of
maximal local discontinuity; and generating a three dimensional boundary surface.In conventional X-ray tomography the apparatus produces images of a single slice
of an object by moving an X-ray camera and the image plate in a complementary manner
so that everything is blurred except for a predetermined plane. Commercial machines
produce images of a number of separate slices, moving the X-ray machine to produce a
planar picture and then moving the object under test in the Z direction to produce a planar
picture at different slices. That needs more total pictures than the views spread over a solid
angle and it produces a cruder representation of a three-dimensional image because volume
cells intermediate between slices have to be derived by interpolation.Conventional tomography thus produces images of discrete slices normal to the axis
of objects of short axial length. It is more common, however, to require images to discrete
slices normal to the axis of a long object. The established form of computer tomography
(CT) is designed to do this. It does it by taking a number line images, at different viewing
angles in the plane of each such slice (typically 360-1440 views, taken at 1° to ¼°
intervals). These are then used to compute the corresponding slice image. However, the
invention - and even the established form of computer tomography - is better understood
by first postulating an extension of computer tomography which, unlike existing systems,
would produce a true three-dimensional mapping of the X-ray densities (i.e. opacities) of
a complete set of symmetrical, equally-spaced volume cells (voxels), in place of merely
producing such information for each of a limited number of parallel slices through the
relevant object. This hypothetical version of computer tomography might map a cubical 
volume L3 into (L/c)3 voxels of size
