<ABSTRACT>
A multispeed bicycle having a plurality of front 
chainwheels (F1,F2,F3), a plurality of 

rear gears (G1-G7), front (3) and rear (5) derailleurs, and a shifting 
apparatus 

operable by a 
single manual lever (10) to actuate the front and rear derailleurs. The 

shifting 
apparatus includes a first actuating mechanism (20) for actuating 

the front 
derailleur, 

a second actuating mechanism (30) for actuating the rear derailleur, and 
a shift 

controller (40) for controlling the actuating mechanisms. The shift 
controller is 

responsive to operation of the manual lever to drive the first 
actuating mechanism 

or second actuating mechanism to produce a speed stage, and 
responsive to 

repeated operation of the manual lever to produce all speed stages 
corresponding 

to all combinations of the front chainwheels and rear gears.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a shifting apparatus for a multispeed bicycle 
having a plurality of front chainwheels, a plurality of rear gears, and front and 
rear derailleurs. This shifting apparatus is operable with a single manual lever 
to actuate the two derailleurs. A known shifting apparatus for a multispeed bicycle as noted above is 
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,194,408, for example. The bicycle has two front 
chainwheels, five rear gears, and front and rear derailleurs for changing a chain 
among these chainwheels and gears. The shifting apparatus includes a pair of 
change speed cams rotatable by a single manual lever, a pivot link pivotable by 
one of the change speed cams to pull or relax a control cable connected to the 
front derailleur, and a pivot link pivotable by the other change speed cam to pull 
or relax a control cable connected to the rear derailleur. When the manual lever 
is operated, the pair of change speed cams cause one or both of the derailleurs 
to change the chain among the front chainwheels and/or rear gears. Thus, the 
shifting apparatus provides 10 speed stages. With an operation of the shifting apparatus, the chain may be changed both 
between the front chainwheels and between the rear gears. For example, the 
chain may be changed from the smaller front chainwheel to the larger front 
chainwheel and from the smallest rear gear to the largest rear gear, or from the 
larger front chainwheel to the smaller front chainwheel and from the largest rear 
gear to the smallest rear gear. A relatively long time is required to complete the  
 
actual shifting operation. For an interval of time 
must be set between the change at the front and the change at the rear, 
e.g. the chain is changed at the front and thereafter at the gear. 
This is necessary to avoid the chain coming off the chainwheels or 
gears which tends to occur when the chain is changed 
simultaneously at the front and the rear. In WO-A-9117078 a multispeed bicycle shifting apparatus corresponding 
to the preamble of claims 1 and 2 with an electronic transmission 
control system is disclosed. The transmission control system 
signals the rider in semi-automatic mode up-shift or downshift 
if the calculated cadence is outside predetermined 
limits. The disclosed device has the drawback, that in cases 
of accelerating or decelerating a new target speed is 
achievable only by operating more than one derailleur. The 
shifting of more than one derailleur causes an inconvenience 
for the rider because a relatively
