<ABSTRACT>
A self-tuning tracking controller for permanent-magnet synchronous motors is 
disclosed, providing for velocity or position trajectory tracking even when both the 

electrical and mechanical parameters of the motor, amplifier, and load are initially 
unknown. A time-scale simplification of a full-order mathematical model of the 

motor leads to a discrete-time design model that is reduced-order and that evolves in 
a mechanical time-scale which is substantially slower than the electrical time-scale, 

permitting implementation of the self-tuning tracking controller with a lower 
sampling frequency (and at a lower cost) than is typically expected. A piecewise-linear 

parameterization of the motor torque-angle characteristic functions allows for 
identification of higher-order harmonics with a degree of accuracy which is selectable 

by the user, without requiring more computation than traditional single-term 
sinusoidal descriptions. Excellent performance is achieved, even with very poor 

initial motor parameter knowledge.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to adaptive control of motors and more 
specifically to self-tuning control of permanent-magnet synchronous motors. Electric motors convert electrical energy into mechanical energy and come in 
a variety of forms and sizes depending on the specific application for which the motor 
is used. Electric motors use a magnetic field to form an energy link between an 
electrical system and a mechanical system. The magnetic field of a motor contributes 
to the production of mechanical output torque and induces voltages (counter emf) in 
coils of wire in the motor. In a permanent-magnet motor, the magnetic field is 
produced in part by permanent magnets mounted on a rotor (the rotating part of the 
motor). The stator (the stationary part of the motor) is typically wound so as to 
provide three sets of poles out of phase by (separated by) 120Â°. Permanent-magnet 
motors constructed in this fashion are generally referred to as synchronous if, when 
powered by three-phase alternating current, the motor operates in synchronism with 
the excitation frequency. Permanent-magnet synchronous motors are particularly 
appropriate for motion control applications because of their potentially very high 
torque-to-weight ratios, cheaper production costs, and superior thermal properties. 
Accordingly, permanent-magnet synchronous motors have found ready application in 
a wide range of environments from small computer disc drives to medium sized 
direct-drive robots. Because permanent-magnet synchronous motors are inherently nonlinear they 
are more difficult to control than their linear counterparts such as, for example, 
mechanically commutated DC motors. Only with the advent of modem nonlinear 
control techniques (and fast microprocessors to implement them) has this difficulty 
been overcome. However, a significant problem remains, in that the new control 
techniques normally require accurate prior knowledge of motor parameters, 
parameters that are either difficult to measure or change with time, or both. 
Generally, motion control systems include a controller, a motor, a load, and sensors. 
Traditional closed-loop control techniques compare a feedback signal representing 
the measured or sensed motor output to an input command (representing the desired  
 
motor output), then adjust the excitation applied to the motor to minimize the 
difference between the input command and the feedback signal. This approach works 
well only when possible system disturbances have been foreseen and modeled,
