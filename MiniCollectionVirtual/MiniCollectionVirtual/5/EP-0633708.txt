<ABSTRACT>
The network has time coupling units or combined time and spatial coupling units. It also has purely spatial coupling units having several inputs and outputs. At least one of the spatial units is arranged such that, as an alternative to its telephone information coupling function, it can be selectively used as a test pattern generator to carry out tests on parts of the network. A test input register (RTS1) is associated with the test generator. The contents of the register are located, in the form of a test pattern, in bit positions allocated to inputs (EO-E15) of the spatial coupler as an alternative to the telephone information statically connected to those inputs. Instead of the switching addresses for exchange operation, control addresses are written into the coupling control memory (CM).

Switching matrix for a digital time-division
multiplex telephone exchange with time switching-stage

units or combined time-space switching-stage units and
pure space switching-stage units, characterized in that

at least one of the space switching-stage units (e.g.
SSM), each of which has a plurality of inputs and

outputs, is equipped such that it can be used, as an
alternative to and as an option in respect of its

switching function, for telephone information, as a
test pattern generator for carrying out tests on parts

of the switching matrix, to which end it is allocated a
test input register (RTSI) whose content, in the form

of a test pattern with bit positions allocated to
individual or all the inputs (E0 to E15) of the space

switching-stage unit, e.g. SSM, can be applied to these
inputs in the steady state as an alternative to the

telephone information that is to be passed through, and
to which end, as an alternative to the through-connection

addresses used for switching operation,
drive addresses can be written to the communications

buffer (CM) used for driving the space switching-stage
unit, the said drive addresses defining the output of

bits having a specific binary value (0; 1) to specific
outputs (e.g. A0 to A7; A8 to A15) of the space

switching-stage unit (SSM) when at least one test
pattern bit is passed through to the outputs (A0 to

A15) of the space switching-stage unit (SSM). 
Switching matrix according to Claim 1,
characterized in that, in the test pattern generator

mode, one and the same binary value is emitted at all
the outputs of the space switching-stage unit.
Switching matrix according to Claim 1,
characterized in that, in the test pattern generator

mode, groups of drive addresses are written separately
to the communications buffer (CM) using groups of time

slots of the multiplex cycle on which multiplex
operation of the space switching-stage unit is based,

the said drive addresses defining, when the test
pattern is passed through to the outputs of the space

switching-stage unit, groups of successive outputs (A0
to A7, A8 to A15) which each emit bits having the same

binary value and produce a respective change in the
binary value when the time-slot group changes.
