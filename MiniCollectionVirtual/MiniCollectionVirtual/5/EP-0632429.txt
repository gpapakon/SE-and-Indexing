<ABSTRACT>
An auto-correlation calculation circuit 
(320,330) calculates an auto-correlation of an 

impulse response signal of a weighting function for 
the corresponding sub-interval of a plurality of 

sub-intervals of an input signal vector. A weighted 
cross-correlation calculation circuit (365) 

calculates a weighted cross-correlation of the 
weighted input signal vector and the weighted 

codevector having a length equal to a code length of 
the input signal vector, by using the input signal 

vector, a plurality of codevectors and a plurality 
of impulse responses. A weighted auto-correlation 

calculation circuit (360) calculates an auto-correlation 
of the weighted codevectors, by using 

the respective auto-correlations of the plurality of 
impulse responses, of the plurality of codevectors 

and of the cross-correlations. A distance between 
the input signal vector and the codevector is 

calculated, by using the cross-correlations of the 
weighted input signal vector and weighted 

codevectors, and the auto-correlation of the 
weighted codevector, and an index of a codevector 

corresponding to the minimum distance is obtained by 
a inspection circuit (370).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vector
quantizer and, more particularly, to a vector
quantizer for a speech coder for coding speech
signals with a high quality at low bit rates,
particularly 4 kb/s or less.A CELP (code excited linear prediction) system
is well known in the art as a system effective for
low bit rate coding speech signals. In the CELP
system, a speech signal is analyzed on the basis of
a linear prediction, and the resultant residual
signal is vector quantized. In an application of
the CELP system to coding at a bit rate 4 kb/s or
less, bits that can be allocated for the residual
signal are insufficient, and therefore it is
necessary to increase the vector length. This leads
to a problem that the quantization of changes in the
speech characteristic in the vector is insufficient.
To solve this problem, a vector quantizer has been
proposed, in which changes in the speech
characteristic in the vector are considered, as
disclosed in Tokugan Hei 4-35881 issued by Japanese
Patent Office, entitled "Speech Coding Apparatus".
In this prior art system, denoting an input signal
vector by x= [x(0), x(1), ..., x(N - 1)], a
codevector for quantizing the input signal vector by
c(i) = [c(i, 0), c(i, 1), ..., c(i, N - 1)], (i being 
the codevector index number, S being a codebook size
and i = 0, 1, ..., S-1), the gain by g(i) and the
weighting function matrix by W, the quantization is
made by searching for an index, with which the
weighting squared distance D(i) in the equation
below is minimum.
D(i) = (x - g(i)c(i))TWTW(x - g(i)c(i))In this case, the optimum value of g(i), with
which the equation (1) assumes a minimum value, is
gopt(i) = xTWTWc(i)/cT(i)WTWc(i)By substituting the equation (1) into the
equation (2),
Dopt(i) = xTWTWx - (xTWTWc(i))2/c(i)TWTWc(i)
where T means the transpose conversion of matrix and
vector.The weighting function matrix W is for a
distinct weighting in each divided sub-interval
(hereinafter referred as sub-interval) in the input
signal vector x. An example will now be
considered, in which the number of sub-intervals is
2, and the weighting is made on an input signal
x(0), ..., x(N(O) - 1) with an impulse response h(0,
i) (i = 0, 1,...,L - 1) and on an input signal
x(N(0)), ..., x(N - 1) with an impulse response h(1,
i) (i = 0, 1, ..., L - 1). The weighting function 
matrix W is given as impulse response matrices
shown by equations (4) to (7).
The first term xTWTWx on the right-hand side
of the equation (3) is not based on any codevector
but is constant, so that it need not be
