<ABSTRACT>
A table, particularly for sectional office furniture 
systems, comprises a structure including a worktop (3, 

3a) and at least one element connecting with the worktop 
(3, 3a). Anchoring means are provided for the structure 

and the element associated with the worktop (3, 3a), 
comprising a rapid-connection system of the 

microconnector type (5, 10) which includes a first 
component (5) fixed to the structure and a second 

component (10) fixed to the element associated with the 
worktop (3, 3a).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a table, particularly 
for sectional office furniture systems. Recently office furniture systems have been developed 
which enable the various modular elements to be assembled 
in arrangements which are personalised to the 
requirements of the final purchaser. In particular, by 
a combination of a relatively small number of basic 
modules it is possible to obtain different arrangements 
which range from individual operating stations - adapted 
for the execution solely of personal processing - to more 
complex furnishing arrangements including, for example, 
a zone for connections, a zone for carrying out personal 
processing, a zone arranged for working with a personal 
computer, etc. In furniture systems of the type specified above there is 
often a need to attach to the worktop accessories such as 
nests of drawers and/or additional shelves which are 
normally located beneath the worktop, or items of various 
types which are usually arranged on top of the 
worksurface and thus render part of it unavailable for  
 
other uses, while it is also necessary to fix the legs, 
or support pillars, to the worktop. In such sectional furniture systems it is essential to 
ensure the maximum possible flexibility in the connection 
of the legs and accessories to the worktop to avoid 
restricting the final purchaser excessively since he 
should be free to choose the arrangement of the support 
elements for the worktop and the accessories according to 
his preferences and so as to utilise the space available 
in the most rational manner; moreover, the connection 
system must be simple to enable the user himself to 
modify the arrangements at will. In order to satisfy these requirements, the present 
invention provides a table, comprising a structure 
including a worktop and at least one element associated 
with the worktop by anchoring means, characterised in 
that the anchoring means comprise a rapid connection 
system of the microconnector type including a first 
component attached to the structure and a second 
component fixed to the element associated with the work 
surface. In the description which follows and in the appended 
claims the term "connection system of the microconnector 
type" is intended to mean a rapid press-fit connection  
 
system which employ mechanical anchoring between a 
plurality of mutually cooperating microconnectors 
provided on two facing surfaces of the components of the 
connection system. Examples of such microconnector 
devices are the so-called

<CLAIMS>
A table, particularly for sectional office systems, 
comprising a structure including a worktop (3, 3a) and at 

least one element associated with the worktop (3, 3a) by 
anchoring means, 

characterised in that the anchoring means comprise a 
rapid-connection system of the microconnector type 

including a first component (5) attached to the structure 
and a second component (10) fixed to the element 

associated with the worktop (3, 3a). 
A table according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the first component (5) of the microconnector connection 

system extends over substantially the entire lower 
surface of the worktop (3, 3a). 
A table according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, 
characterised in that the element associated with the 

worktop (3, 3a) is a support element (7) for the worktop 
(3, 3a). 
A table according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, 
characterised in that the element associated with the 

worktop (3, 3a) is a support structure (12, 12a) for at 
least one drawer (13). 
A table according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, 
characterised in that the element associated with the 

worktop (3, 3a) is a connecting element (18) for 
connecting a plurality of adjacent worktops (3, 3a). 
A table according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, 
characterised in that the element associated with the 

worktop (3, 3a) is a central unit (23) of a processor. 
A table according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, 
characterised in that the element associated with the 

worktop (3, 3a) is a support element for electrical 
cables (27). 
A table according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
it further includes an auxiliary support element (31a, 

31b, 31c) having a wall perpendicular to the worktop (3, 
3a), to which one of the said components (5, 10) is 

fixed, the other component (10, 5) being fixed to the 
element associated with the worktop (3, 3a). 
An element of a furniture structure, particularly a 
table for an office, intended to be attached to at least 

one other element of the furniture structure by anchoring 
means, characterised in that the anchoring means include 

a connection system of the microconnector type including 
first and second components adapted to engage each other 

 
reciprocally, in which the first component is fixed to 

the said element and the second component is fixed to the 
said other element so that the said element can be 

anchored to the said other element.
