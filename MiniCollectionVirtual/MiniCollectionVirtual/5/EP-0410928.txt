Explosively actuated bolt setting tool comprising 
a drive-in piston (8, 36) having a head (9, 

37) and a shaft (11, 38), a bolt guide (4, 32) 
having a bore (4a, 32a) which substantially corresponds 

with the diameter of the shaft (11, 38) 
of the drive-in piston (8, 36), an intercepting 

device (14, 41) for intercepting the drive-in 
piston (8, 36) whilst overcoming a specified 

counter-recoil path (B) of the drive-in piston 
(8, 36) which has contact with the intercepting 

device (14,41) in the drive-in direction and a 
plastically deformable stopper (27, 46), 


characterised in that
 the plastically deformable 
stopper (27, 46) is supported in the drive-in 

direction against the bolt guide (4, 32), and 
the drive-in piston (8, 36) has a shoulder (12a, 

47) which extend in the axial projection of the 
stopper (27, 46), in which respect the distance 

(A) extending parallel to the drive-in direction 
between the stopper (27, 46) and the shoulder 

(12a, 47) corresponds maximally with the 
counter-recoil path (B), as offered by the 

intercepting device (14, 41), of the drive-in 
piston (8, 36) which has contact with the intercepting 

device (14, 41). 
Setting tool according to claim 1, 
characterised 
in that
 the shoulder is arranged as an annular 
shoulder (12a, 47) which is oriented towards the 

drive-in direction and extends radially beyond 
shaft (11, 38) of the drive-in piston (8, 36).  

 
Setting tool according to claim 1 or 2, 


characterised in that
 the stopper (27, 46) is 
hollow-cylindrically and concentrically 

surrounds the shaft (11, 38) of the drive-in 
piston (8, 36). 
Setting tool according to claim 3, 
characterised 
in that
 the stopper (27, 46) is arranged in a 
recess (26, 45) of the bolt guide (4, 32) with 

an internal contour (26a, 45a) which corresponds 
with the external contour of the stopper (27, 

46), and with a free end surface towards the 
annular shoulder (12a, 47) of the drive-in 

piston (8, 36). 
Setting tool according to claim 4, 
characterised 
in that
 the recess (26, 45) comprises a bottom 
(26b, 45b) facing against the drive-in direction 

and having a contour which conically narrows in 
the drive-in direction. 
Setting tool, in particular according to claims 
1 to 5, 
characterised in that
 the intercepting 
device (14) is supported against the bolt guide 

(4) via an elastic buffer (23). 
Setting tool according to one of claims 1 to 6, 

characterised in that
 the intercepting device 
(14, 41) is radially expandable whilst overcoming 

a spring force. 
Setting tool according to claim 7, 
characterised 
in that
 the intercepting device (14) is arranged 
as a sleeve body with segments (18) which are 

controlled against their own springiness. 
Setting tool according to claim 7, 
characterised 
in that
 the intercepting device (41) is an 
expandable annular body which is surrounded by 

spring elements (42, 43).
