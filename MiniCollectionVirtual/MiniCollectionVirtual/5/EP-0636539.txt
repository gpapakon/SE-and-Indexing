<ABSTRACT>
A speed change operating device 
(6) for a bicycle capable of effecting speed 

change operation while braking operation is 
being carried out, as well as performing an 

optimum speed change operation in accordance 
with various running conditions, said 

device comprising a speed change operating 
body (14) supported so as to be rotated 

around the axial center of a handle bar (3), a 
cable take-up body (107), a locking mechanism 

(15) for locking said cable take-up body 
in a predetermined rotating position, and a 

transmission mechanism (101) for transmitting 
rotating operations of said speed change 

operating body to said cable take-up body, 
wherein said transmission mechanism comprises 

a transmission ring (103) connected so 
as not to rotate relatively to said cable take-up 

body and having an engagement toothed 
portion on its outer circumferential portion 

and an engagement pawl (110) held so as to 
radially slide between said speed change operating 

body and said transmission ring and 
adapted to be shifted radially inwardly when 

said speed change operating body is rotated 
so as to be brought into engagement with 

said engagement toothed portion, whereby 
said cable take-up body is rotated in a cable 

pulling direction or a cable paying-out 
direction when said speed change operating 

body is reciprocatingly rotated from a predetermined 
rotation starting point.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a bicycle speed change 
operation assembly, and more specifically to a bicycle speed 
change operation assembly wherein a speed change operation can be 
performed during a braking operation without deteriorating control 
stability. A bicycle speed change assembly for sports type bicycles such 
as a racing bicycle is often mounted on a bicycle frame member 
such as the down tube or the top tube. Therefore, the rider must unhand the handlebar to perform a 
speed change operation. As a result, it is impossible to 
immediately perform a braking operation during the speed change 
operation. In addition, the rider has to assume a single hand 
steering, which leads to unstable handlebar operation and poor 
safety. The speed change operation is required mainly when road 
conditions change, for example, from a flat road to a slope, or 
vice versa. In such occasions the bicycle becomes unstable and 
the brake operation is often needed. In an attempt to solve this problem the Japanese Utility  
 
Model Laid-open 58-46693, for example, discloses a speed change 
operation assembly, wherein a cylindrical operation member is 
fitted around each of the left and right grip portions of the 
handlebar, and these cylindrical operation members are rotated to 
pull or pay out respective speed control cables. This type of 
speed change operation assembly is commonly called a grip 
rotating type speed change operation assembly In this grip rotating type speed change operation assembly, 
it becomes possible to perform a speed change operation without 
unhanding the handlebar grip portion, resulting in remarkable 
improvement in riding safety. In off-road riding on a mountain bike for example, it is 
sometimes necessary to perform a speed change operation at the 
same time with a braking operation. In such a case, however, with the conventional grip rotating 
type speed change operation assembly, the cylindrical operation 
member must be rotated to a rotational position corresponding to a 
speed step. In particular, when the speed change operation is 
required through a plurality of speed steps, the amount of 
rotation required of the cylindrical operation member becomes 
large, and therefore, the hand and fingers must be re-positioned 
on the cylindrical operation member. Thus, it is very difficult 
to perform a speed change operation while operating the brake 
lever in the conventional handlebar rotating type speed change 
operation assembly. In addition the speed change operation is performed

<CLAIMS>
A bicycle speed change operation assembly comprising: 
   a speed change operation member supported for rotation about 

an axis of a handlebar between a handlebar grip portion and a 
fixing member fitted around the handlebar; 

   a cable winding member supported in the fixing member for 
rotation about the handlebar axis to wind or pay out a speed 

control cable; 
   a retaining mechanism provided within the fixing member for 

holding the cable winding member at predetermined rotational 
positions; and 

   a transmission mechanism provided between the speed change 
operation member and the cable winding member for transmitting 

rotational movement of the speed change operation member to the 
cable winding member; wherein the transmission mechanism 

includes: 
   a transmission ring supported inward radially of the speed 

change operation member for rotation about the handlebar axis and 
connected to the cable winding member so as to be non-rotatable 

relative thereto, the transmission ring having an outer 
circumference formed with an engaging teeth portion; and 

   an engaging pawl held radially slidably between the speed 
change operation member and the transmission ring so as to 

displace radially inwardly for engagement with the engaging teeth 
portion in response to a rotational operation of the speed change 

operation member in either of cable winding and cable paying out 
directions;

 
   wherein the cable winding member is rotated in either of the 

cable pulling and cable paying out directions in response to a 
rotational reciprocation of the speed change operation member 

from a predetermined commencing point of rotation. 
The bicycle speed change operation assembly according to 
Claim 1, wherein the speed change operation member is elastically 

urged by a spring to a neutral position which is the commencing 
point of rotation in either of the cable winding and cable paying 

out directions, and 
   the transmission mechanism allows the cable winding member to 

rotate with the speed change operation member when the speed 
change operation member is rotated in either of the cable winding 

and cable paying out directions from the neutral position, the 
transmission mechanism further allowing the engaging pawl to 

displace radially outwardly for cancelling rotational coupling 
relation between the speed change operation member and the cable 

winding member when the speed change operation member rotates back 
toward the neutral position. 
A bicycle speed change operation assembly including a speed 
change operation member supported for rotation about an axis of a 

handlebar inward axially of a handlebar grip portion: 
   wherein the speed change operation member has an outer 

circumference formed with first and second press operation 
portions each extending radially outwardly at a predetermined 

angular interval from the other. 
The bicycle speed change operation assembly according to 
Claim 3, wherein at least one of the first and second press 

operation portions rotates in a plane intersecting with a pivotal 
plane of the brake lever, said one press operation portion and the 

brake lever are configured to have respective travel paths which 
do not interfere with each other. 
The bicycle speed change operation assembly according to 
Claim 3, wherein at least one of the first and second press 

operation portions is formed with an extension projecting toward 
the handlebar grip portion. 
The bicycle speed change operation assembly according to 
Claim 3, wherein the speed change operation member has an outer 

circumference formed with a depressed portion contoured to fit the 
anatomical snuffbox of the rider operating the press operation 

portions.

portion provided with an extended portion extending radially 
outwardly between the fixing member and the speed change operation 

member, the extended portion having an outer face which 
cooperates with an outer face of the fixing member to provide an 

indicator indicating a speed step.
