<ABSTRACT>
A process for removing NOX from combustion gases by adsorption includes the step of desorbing the NOX when the adsorbent is saturated to create an effluent (2). The effluent is mixed with a reducing gas and passed over a reduction catalyst which reduces the NOX to water and elemental nitrogen. The resultant harmless gas is discharged to the atmosphere (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
There has been great activity in the field of removing NOx
from combustion zone gases. Much of the work has been done on the
removal of SOx and NOx from a gas stream derived from coal and
residual oil burning furnaces of electric power generating
stations. There are many examples of this process stream being
purified of the SOx and NOx, but that is not a part of the present
invention. When both SOx and NOx are present, many of the schemes
handle the SOx in one reactor and NOx in a second reactor, after SOx
has been removed. This process and its many variations are not
particularly pertinent to the present invention.U.S. Patent Nos. 4,182,745 and 4,282,115 are of interest.
U.S. Patent No. 4,182,745 issued to
Nishida, et al. describes a typical method used for removal of
nitrogen oxide by selective conversion by reaction of the nitrogen
oxide with ammonia in the presence of oxygen. This process is
described and other background information given in column 1, lines
10 through 51.The uniqueness of the Nishida et al. catalysts is stated
also in column 1, lines 53 through 65. The catalysts which are
useful in this process are the heteropolyacids and their salts are 
also identified as being applicable, those are enumerated in column
2, lines 28 through 54.There are many points of difference between the Nishida
et al. process reference (known broadly as the SCR process) and the
process of the present invention. First is that the present
invention uses no ammonia, whereas, the SCR process uses ammonia as
a selective reducing agent. The second point of difference is that
the catalyst and adsorbent of the present invention preferably operate at less
than 300°C, which is a typical commercially economic condition.
The catalyst in question in the SCR process, must operate above
350°, and the single example shows it operating at 400°C, thus
entailing a substantial commercial liability for heating the flue
gas or heat exchanging after the reduction. In this process the
permissible space velocity is 3,000 to 8,000 where as in the
present invention the space velocity preferably is 12,000 to 18,000 making for
lower capital costs.U.S. Patent No. 4,282,115 issued to Atsukawa, et al. as
described in the abstract, uses ammonia as a reducing agent for the
reduction of the nitrogen oxides. The novel feature of this patent
is that a unique support, calcium silicate, is used and is
purported to provide improved resistance to sulfur poisoning.
Thus, the thrust of this patent is one of an improved support.

<CLAIMS>
A process for removing NO
x
 from combustion product gases
containing NO
x
 and oxygen including the steps of

a) feeding the NO
x
 in a feed gas stream devoid of
ammonia to a catalyst-adsorbent at a temperature in

the range of 100°C to 500°C, the catalyst -
adsorbent including a mixture of manganese oxide

and aluminum oxide wherein the mixture contains
from 80% to 20% by weight manganese oxide and from

20% to 80% by weight aluminum oxide,
b) when the catalyst-adsorbent is saturated, desorbing
the NO
x
 at a slightly higher temperature using a gas
stream which contains hydrogen, water vapor and

nitrogen but no oxygen,
c) creating a mixture from the desorption effluent and
a reducing gas,
d) passing the mixture over a reduction catalyst to
reduce the NO
x
 to water and elemental nitrogen, and
discharging the resultant harmless gas to the

atmosphere.
The process of Claim 1, wherein the NO
x
 is desorbed by
contact with a reducing gas, passing the resultant gases

to a reduction catalyst where most of the NO
x
 is reduced
to H
2
O and elemental N
2
 and returning the effluent gas
if still containing unreduced NO
x
 to the combustion zone
where the NO
x
 is abated. 
The process of Claim 2, wherein the combustion zone gas
is used for a boiler or other heat utilizing requirement

and is then discharged as flue gas.
The process of Claim 1, wherein the NO
x
 is simultaneously
desorbed and reduced by the catalyst-adsorbent itself

acting as the reduction catalyst.
A process of Claim 1, wherein said catalyst-adsorbent
further includes an alkali carbonate or potassium

permanganate, potassium chromate or potassium
dichromate, the alkali carbonate being selected from the

group consisting of carbonates of potassium, sodium,
rubidium and cesium and the alkali content being from 5%

to 50% of the total weight of the adsorbent, and wherein
the oxides further include an oxide selected from the

group consisting of silica, thoria, mangesia, calcia,
strontia, titania, zirconia, stania, baria and mixtures

thereof or oxides of the lanthanides.
The process of Claim 5, wherein after the combustion gas
containing NO
x
 is no longer fed to the adsorbent, the
inlet gas to the adsorbent is altered to a nitrogen

containing hydrogen gas and the temperature is
increased, thereby reducing the adsorbed NO
x
 in situ to
N
2
 and H
2
O and some desorbed NO
x
.
The process of Claim 5, wherein the combustion gas is a
compressor or turbine discharge gas. 
The process of Claim 5 further including

flowing the NO
x
 containing combustion gas on a
cyclic schedule to one or two adsorbers,
after a period of time stopping the NO
x
 containing
gas flow and
then conducting a stripper gas containing a
reducing gas to the adsorbers where the NO
x
 adsorbed
is simultaneously desorbed and reduced to H
2
O and
elemental N
2
.
