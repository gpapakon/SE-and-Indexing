Thermal protection device which can be used 
especially for protecting a disk- or drum-brake cap and 

composed of a support (2) and a thermal screen (1), the 
latter comprising a plate pierced through by an orifice 

(1a) in order to present an outer edge (1b) and an inner 
edge (1c), which plate consists of an elastically 

deformable material not subject to buckling and is held 
in place on the support by means of at least one first 

bearing surface (4a) on which it exerts, by its inner 
edge, a force resulting from its elastic deformation, 

said device comprising additional bearing means (2b) 
supplying the plate with a second bearing surface (4b) 

and enabling this plate to exert on the first and second 
bearing surfaces forces respectively oriented in opposite 

directions, the inner edge of the plate being cut out so 
as to present a plurality of tabs (1e), and the support 

comprising a cylindrical portion (2a) which supplies its 
periphery with a first bearing surface essentially 

reduced to a circle, the second bearing surface (4b) 
comprising at least one portion of an axial face of a 

second cylindrical portion (2b) of the support, 
contiguous with the first and arranged towards the 

outside of this first cylindrical portion (2a) along a 
radial direction of the latter, characterized in that the 

axial face of the second cylindrical portion of the 
support is, except in the location of the second bearing 

surface, hollowed out so as to produce a cavity (2f), in 
that the plate, in the vicinity of its inner edge, is 

deformed out of its plane along two folds of opposite 
concavities in order to form an annular flange (1f), in 

that said flange is engaged in the cavity without 
touching the bottom of it and in that the second bearing 

surface (4b) comprises at least one portion of the 
periphery of the axial face of said second cylindrical 

portion.
