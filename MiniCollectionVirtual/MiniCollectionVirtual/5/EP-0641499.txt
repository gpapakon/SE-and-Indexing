<ABSTRACT>
The rotational electric motor (6) described has, located in a housing (2, 4), a stationary internal stator (10) and a bell-shaped external rotor (8). Located in the space (3) between the rotor (8) and the housing (4) is a certain quantity of hydraulic fluid (F). Disposed on the outside of the rotor (8) are vanes (20) which act in conjunction with adjustable vanes (22) located on the inside of the housing (4) to produce a given braking effect which depends on the position of the adjustable vanes. This hydrodynamic brake is used as a retarder, for example in a non-rail vehicle whose drive wheels (14) are individually driven by motors (6) of this kind.

A rotational electric motor vehicle drive motor 
comprising a internal stator (10) and an external 

rotor (8) having a sealed casing (2, 4) provided 
on the outside thereof,
 
characterized in that a hydrodynamic brake (F, 20, 

22) adapted to be selectively activated and deactivated 
is formed between said external rotor 

(8) and said casing (2, 4). 
A motor according to claim 1,
 
characterized in that said hydrodynamic brake comprises: 


(a) concomitantly rotating moving blades (20) disposed 
on the outside of said external rotor 

(8), 
(b) fixed guide blades (22) disposed internally on 
said casing (4), and 
(c) hydraulic liquid (F) introduced in the space 
(3) between said blades (20, 22). 
A motor according to claim 2,
 
characterized in that said external rotor (8) is 

bell-shaped, with said blades (20, 22) being disposed, 
with respect to the axis of rotation (A), 

radially outside on said external rotor (8) and on 
the inside of said casing (4), respectively.  

 
A motor according to any one of claims 1 to 3,
 
characterized in that said casing (4) is provided 

with a liquid inlet (40) and a liquid outlet (42) 
through which the amount of hydraulic liquid (F) 

in said space (3) and thus the braking power can 
be metered. 
A motor according to any one of claims 2 to 4,
 
characterized in that the guide blades (22) disposed 

on said casing (4) are coupled at least in 
part with an adjusting means (26 to 32) through 

which said braking power can be adjusted. 
A motor according to claims 1 to 5,
 
characterized in that the casing comprises an externally 

disposed cooling means (160) for dissipating 
the thermal energy produced by the hydrodynamic 

brake. 
A rotational electric motor vehicle drive motor 
comprising an internal stator (10) and an external 

rotor (108) having a sealed casing (104) provided 
on the outside thereof,
 
characterized in that a brake is provided which is 

adapted to be selectively activated and deactivated 
and which comprises a pumping fluid circuit 

having a flow resistance (156, 157) adapted to be 
actuated, as well as a flow pump formed between 

said external rotor (108) and said casing (104) 
and incorporated in said pumping fluid circuit. 
A motor according to claim 7,
 
characterized in that said flow pump comprises: 


(a) moving blades (120) disposed on the face side 
of said bell-shaped external rotor (108),  

 
(b) preferably, fixed guide blades (122) disposed 
on the inside of said casing (104), and 
(c) hydraulic liquid/pumping fluid (F) introduced 
in the space between said blades. 
A motor according to claims 7 and 8,
 
characterized in that said casing (104) is provided 

with an axial liquid inlet (155) on the face 
side and with at least one liquid outlet (151, 

152) at a radially outer location, to both of 
which a consumer (150) for the flow power and thus 

the braking power is connected. 
A motor according to any one of claims 1 to 9,
 
characterized by a regulating means adapted to 

actively regulate the braking power of the brake. 
A non-track-bound vehicle comprising at least one 
drive motor according to any one of claims 1 to 

10. 
A vehicle according to claim 11,
 
characterized in that the motor is adapted to be 

operated as a generator.
