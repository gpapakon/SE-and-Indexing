<ABSTRACT>
A variable gain amplifier is composed of a first 
voltage-to-current amplifier having a fixed gain; a 

second voltage-to-current amplifier having a variable 
gain, functioning in parallel to said first amplifier; 

a gain control and stabilization variable current 
generator; a current-to-voltage converter. Current 

output signals produced by said first and second 
amplifiers and by said variable current generator are 

summed and the resulting current signal is converted to 
a voltage signal by said converter.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a variable gain
amplifier (VGA) particularly suited for automatic gain
control systems (AGC).Typically, automatic gain control (AGC) systems
are implemented by employing a variable gain
amplifier (VGA), a detector (a peak or average
value detector) capable of providing an information
on the signal level in the loop, and a
bidirectional current generator driven by the
detector and finally a capacitor for stabilizing
the loop and constituting an analog memory of
the system. A system of this type is schematically
shown in Fig. 1.Characterizing performance parameters of a
variable gain amplifier (VGA) , may be listed as
follows:
Frequency bandRange of variation of the gain Maximum level of the input signalMaximum level of the output signalLinearityOutput offsetEquivalent input noise  Specific requirements dictated by the particular
field of application and therefore different
performance parameters determine the choice among
numerous amplifier circuits, suitable to be
integrated on silicon.In order to implement an automatic gain control
before a demodulation stage of the Intermediate
Frequency block of a TV receiver, it is necessary
to provide for an interval of variation of the gain of 
about 60dB. Therefore, it is often necessary to employ
a chain of several amplifying stages in cascade. On
ther other hand, in consideration of the band characteristics
of the processed TV signal, the coupling
between the various stages is usually implemented in an
AC mode. Therefore, the output offset that was mentioned
above among other merit parameters of a VGA,
loses its relevance in this case. A typical amplifier
structure that is employed in integrated TV circuits
for implementing a VGA is shown in Fig. 2.If the control current: Icont=0, the gain of the
stage is almost equal to the ratio 2RL/RE, where RE is
the total emitter-degeneration resistance. By increasing
Icont, the diodes turn on and, by adding their
own impedance: 1/gm, in parallel to the modules that
make up RE, modify (decrease) the gain.The Article: "A 50-dB Variable Gain Amplifier Using Parasitic
Bipolar Transistors in CMOS", by Tzu-Wang Pan et al., IEEE Journal of
Solid-State Circuits Vol. 24, no. 4, August 1989, New York, US, describes
a variable gain amplifier (VGA) implemented in CMOS technology
employing parasitic lateral and vertical bipolar transistors to form the core
of the variable gain amplifier. The circuit is composed by a voltage to
current amplifier with a variable gain (Q5, Q6, M1, M2), by a gain control,
