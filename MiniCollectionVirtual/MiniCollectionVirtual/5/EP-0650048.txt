<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to probes and probe
bodies for measuring a desired parameter, such as
capacitance. More particularly, the invention relates
to a capacitance probe and probe body of the type used
for measuring capacitance to detect the level of liquid
in a pressure vessel, and still more particularly, to
such a probe that resists leakage and, in one
embodiment, is explosionproof.In industrial metrology, capacitance commonly
is used to determine the level of liquid in vessels,
particularly in closed vessels. One method of
measuring capacitance is through the use of a
concentric-type plate capacitor. A concentric-type
plate capacitor utilizes a conductive probe as the
center plate of a coaxial capacitor. This conductive
probe is usually a cylindrical metal rod (center or
probe rod) that is insulated to measure conductive
liquid levels. The vessel walls typically form the
second plate of the capacitor while the liquid to be
measured is the dielectric. The capacitance of a
concentric-type plate capacitor is given by the
equation:

where
C = capacitance; ε = dielectric constant (1.000590 for air);L = length of concentric immersion by the probe
rod;r0 = radius of the inside of the outer wall of the
vessel; andr1 = radius of the metallic probe rod.The presence of material in the vessel
creates a concentric-type plate capacitor with the
liquid serving as the dielectric. Therefore, if one
knows the dielectric constant of the material in the
vessel, by measuring the capacitance, C, it is possible
to determine the level of material in the vessel. The
probe is connected via suitable electrical connections
to capacitance-measuring circuitry. In measuring the
capacitance, a lower intrinsic capacitance of the
capacitance probe itself is desirable in order to more
accurately gauge changes in the overall capacitance
that are caused by changes in the liquid level.Typical capacitance probes use metallic
mounting glands to mount the probe rod to the vessel
and to the electronics housing. The internal portion
of the mounting gland contains: (1) a pressure sealing
system; and (2) a probe rod retaining system. The
probe rod itself is typically a metallic rod sheathed
in polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) or other suitable
polymer. The probe rod must pass through the metallic
mounting gland with no metallic contact.Referring to FIG. 1, an existing capacitance
probe includes a packing gland 10 that is threaded into
a mounting gland 12. A center rod or probe rod 14
extends from an electronics housing (not shown) through
metal
