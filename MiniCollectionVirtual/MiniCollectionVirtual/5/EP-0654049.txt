<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for preparation of chlorinated 
polyolefin resins in a reaction medium which is resistant to chlorination. Chlorinated olefin polymers are well-known and widely available 
compositions which find use as general purpose elastomers, adhesives, and 
coating compositions. The polymers provide excellent resistance to acids, 
bases, and solvents, and, in addition, they display a high degree of flexibility, 
ozone resistance, and general overall weatherability. Substantial quantities 
of these products are fabricated into pond and pit liners, roofing 
membranes, binder resins for coatings, gaskets, wire coverings, and 
adhesives. The polymers are prepared on a commercial scale by solution or 
suspension chlorination of olefin homopolymers or copolymers in a 
chlorinated reaction medium, such as carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, 
methylene chloride, or trichlorofluoromethane. When a solvent process is 
used the preferred medium is carbon tetrachloride because it is totally inert 
to chlorination, it is readily available, and it is easily separated from the 
polymer product. The use of carbon tetrachloride has been increasingly 
restricted however due to its activity as a stratospheric ozone depleter and 
the fact that it is a suspected human carcinogen. Consequently there is a 
need in the art for a solvent which can be used in chlorination reactions on a 
commercial scale which combines the desirable features of carbon 
tetrachloride without its disadvantages. The present invention provides a process for chlorination of olefin 
polymers in a reaction medium which is substantially inert to chlorination 
and which does not deplete ozone. More specifically, the present invention 
provides a process for chlorination of olefin polymers which comprises (a) 
dissolving or suspending a C2-C8 olefin polymer in 
monochloromonofluorobenzene, (b) introducing a chlorinating agent 
selected from the group consisting of elemental chlorine, sulfuryl chloride,  
 
and a mixture of elemental chlorine and sulfur dioxide into the reaction 
mixture in the presence of a free radical initiator, (c) chlorinating the olefin 
polymer at a temperature of 50-150°C, and (d) isolating the chlorinated 
olefin polymer from the reaction mixture. A wide variety of olefin polymers may be used in the process of the 
present invention. By olefin polymers is meant homopolymers and 
copolymers of C2-C8 alpha-monoolefins, including graft copolymers. 
Particularly useful examples include homopolymers of C2-C3 alpha
