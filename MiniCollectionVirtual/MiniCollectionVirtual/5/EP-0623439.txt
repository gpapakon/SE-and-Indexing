<ABSTRACT>
A synthetic resin pelletizing machine includes an 
extrusion cylinder (10) forming, with a horizontal plane, an 

installation angle ϑ which is in the range of 0° 
<
ϑ
<
90° , 
a raw material feed passage (15) extending upwardly from said 

extrusion cylinder (10) at a predetermined angle relative to 
a longitudinal axis of said extrusion cylinder (10), and a 

cooling unit (2) disposed below a die head (14) and having a 
double bath construction composed of a first cooling bath 

(21) and a second cooling bath disposed in the first cooling 
bath (22). The pelletizing machine thus constructed is 

compact in size and is capable of assuring a smooth feed of 
a raw material to the extrusion cylinder (10) as well as a 

smooth passage of an extruded strand (S) through the cooling 
unit (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a synthetic resin 
pelletizing machine according to the precharacterising part of 
claim 1. In the synthetic resin molding industry, it is a 
customary practice to mix a plurality of synthetic resin 
materials of different properties to form a molded product 
of desired characteristics. In this instance, if the mixing 
is not homogeneous, the final product has undesired characteristics. 
To avoid this problem, as disclosed in Japanese 
Patent Publication No. 63-32604, each of various synthetic 
resins are separately supplied to an extrusion unit in which 
each kind of resin is melted with heat and extruded as a 
strand into a cooling water bath. The cooled strand is cut 
into fine granules or pellets. The fine pellets thus produced 
are then mixed with similar pellets of different kinds 
of synthetic resins to form a molded article.  
 In general, the conventional pelletizing machine 
of the type concerned is, as also mentioned in the above-referenced 
Japanese patent publication, a large-sized machine 
to cope with the mass-production system. Accordingly, the 
extrusion unit incorporated in such a large-sized pelletizing 
machine is necessarily large in size, and taking the maintenance 
into account, it is composed of a horizontal-type 
extrusion unit having an extrusion cylinder horizontally 
mounted on a machine frame. The known pelletizing machine of the foregoing 
construction occupies a large space in a horizontal direction 
and, hence, uses the space inefficiently. In addition, 
the known pelletizing machine is not adaptable to the multi-product, 
small-quantity production system which has recently 
been required for various molded articles. An attempted use 
of the conventional pelletizing machine in the multi-product, 
small-quantity production system would produce an excessive 
stock of molded articles, requiring a complicated stock control 
operation. Accordingly, there is a keen demand for a 
pelletizing machine which is compact in size and readily 
adaptable to the multi-product, small-quantity production 
system. Furthermore, since the raw resin is supplied to the 
horizontal-type extrusion cylinder at right angles to the 
axis of an extrusion screw, the raw resin is likely to get 
clogged at an inlet of the extrusion cylinder. In addition,  
 
the strand, as it is extruded from the horizontal-type 
extrusion cylinder into a cooling bath, is subjected to a 
lateral bending force which will exert negative influence 
on the quality of the pellets produced

<CLAIMS>
A synthetic resin pelletizing machine of the type 
having a molding portion in which a raw material including a 

synthetic resin, a pigment and various additives is melted and 
kneaded and then shaped by extrusion into a strand (S), and 

the extruded strand (S) is cooled, wherein an extrusion 
cylinder (10) having at its lower end a die head (14) forms, 

with a horizontal plane, an installation angle Θ which is in 
the range of 0°

path for the passage therealong the strand (S); and a cutting 
unit (4) is disposed substantially at a downstream end of said 

feed path for cutting the strand (S) into pellets of a 
predetermined size, characterised in that  

 
a raw material feed passage (15) 

extends upwardly from said extrusion cylinder (10) at a 
predetermined angle relative to a longitudinal axis of said 

extrusion cylinder (10) and in that 
said cooling 

unit (2) has a double bath construction composed of a first 
cooling bath (21) and a second cooling bath (22) disposed in 

said first cooling bath (21).
