<ABSTRACT>
The mechanism has an extra chain attached to the outer cylinder (2) at one end, and to the inner cylinder (4) at the opposite end, passing around one or more guide rolls at an angle of 180 degrees . Moving the spindle causes the chain to apply a traction force to the inner cylinder, whilst at the same time this spindle movement also exerts a force on an intermediate cylinder (3). The mechanism comprises a telescopic column with a concentric arrangement of outer, intermediate and inner cylinders, the inner cylinder being movable in an axial direction out of the column. A lifting spindle (5) is provided for raising the intermediate and inner cylinders out of the outer cylinder. A chain (6) attached to the bottom region of the inner cylinder at one end, and to the outer cylinder (2) at the opposite end, extends around one or more guide rolls (7).

Lifting arrangement, preferably for the height adjustment of a hospital bed, comprising a telescopic lifting column having an outer lifting cylinder (2), a central, extensible lifting cylinder (3) arranged concentrically therein, and an inner, axially extensible lifting cylinder (4) arranged, in turn, concentrically in the central lifting cylinder,

having a lifting drive (5) for extending the central lifting cylinder (3) and the inner lifting cylinder (4) out of the outer lifting cylinder (2),

having a first pulling mechanism (6), which, at one end, is secured in the bottom region on the inner lifting cylinder (4) and, at its other end, is secured on the outer lifting cylinder (2),

with the result that, when the lifting drive (5) is actuated, the lifting distance covered by the inner lifting cylinder (4) is double that covered in each case by the lifting drive (5),

having at least a second pulling mechanism (11), which, at one end, is secured on the outer lifting cylinder (2) and, at its other end, is secured on the inner lifting cylinder (4), with the result that, when the lifting drive (5) is moved downwards, the inner lifting cylinder (4) is subjected to a tensile force via the second pulling mechanism (11), the central lifting
 cylinder (3) being subjected to a force by the lifting drive (5) at the same time as the latter is moved downwards, the lifting drive (5) being a lifting spindle and this lifting spindle being assigned a spindle nut which is fastened in the bottom end region on the central lifting cylinder (3),
characterized
in that
 the first pulling mechanism (6) is deflected over at least a first deflecting roller (7), in that the second pulling mechanism (11) is deflected by approximately 180° over at least a second deflecting roller (10),
in that
 the lifting spindle (5) penetrates into the inner lifting cylinder (4) when the lifting column is retracted,

and 
in that
 the first deflecting roller (7) for the first pulling mechanism (6) is arranged centrally in the inner lifting cylinder (4) and above the lifting spindle (5) and is fastened on the central lifting cylinder (3).
Lifting arrangement according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the second deflecting roller (10), over which the second pulling mechanism (11) is guided, is fastened on the central lifting cylinder (3).
Lifting arrangement according to either of Claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that
 the second deflecting roller (10) for the second pulling mechanism (11) is fastened in the bottom end region on the central lifting cylinder (3).
Lifting arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 the second pulling mechanism (11) is a cable pull or the like.
Lifting arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that
 the first pulling mechanism (6) is fastened in the bottom end region on the inner lifting cylinder (4) at a fastening point (9), this first pulling mechanism (6) being guided over the first deflecting roller (7) and being deflected there by approximately 180° and, at its other end, this first pulling mechanism (6) being secured on a rod (15) which is fixed to the outer lifting cylinder (2).
Lifting arrangement, preferably for a hospital bed, according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that
 the first pulling mechanism (6) is a chain.
Lifting arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that
 the second deflecting roller (10) for the second pulling mechanism (11) is arranged eccentrically in the vicinity of the circumferential region of the central lifting cylinder (3).
