<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an adjustable folding cover for sun beds, The users of sun beds often need to shelter part of their body from the wind 
and/or sun. This is currently done with makeshift shelters, which obviously cannot fulfil 
the user's needs. Attempts have also been made to provide sun beds with special hood-like 
covers that shelter the user' head. However, these known covering systems present considerable drawbacks. A first drawback is due to the fact that these covers require a specially 
designed bed and therefore are not suitable for the various types of sun beds 
existing on the market. Besides, these covers can be defined as being of the fixed type, in that once 
they are mounted on the bed the operations are required to dismantle them are 
so lengthy that they are normally carried out - if at all - only at the end of the 
bathing season. Another drawback is that opening of these covers is not 
normally adjustable. The object of the invention is to eliminate the drawbacks described above, 
providing a cover for sun beds that adapts to the various types of beds 
existing on the market, that can be adjusted through an arc of about 180Â° 
longitudinally to the bed, that can easily be assembled and dismantled, that  
 
can easily be partially opened and that occupies the minimum space during 
storage and transport. Another object of the invention is to provide such a cover that can be applied 
to a pair of beds placed side by side and that can be closed in its dismantled 
state, These aims are achieved by the cover for sun beds according to the 
invention having the characteristics listed in the attached claim 1. Preferred embodiments of the invention are described in the dependent 
claims. The cover for sun beds according to the invention is of the folding hood or 
bellows type and comprises a frame with a plurality of supporting rods for a 
canvas, the front one preferably being rigid and the others flexible and 
articulated at the ends, so that their degree of opening can be adjusted. The cover thus structured is fixed to the bed by means of quick connections 
provided on the two sides of the bed. According to one embodiment, such a connection consists of a rigid block 
that is fixed to a corresponding longitudinal bar of the sun-bed frame, by 
means of an inner counter-plate and a threaded pin or bolt that protrudes 
externally from the rigid block and is inserted in a hole in the frame of the 
cover, which is then blocked by means of an outer knob. The supporting frame of the
