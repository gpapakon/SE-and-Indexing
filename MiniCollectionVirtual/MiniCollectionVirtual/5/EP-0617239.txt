<ABSTRACT>
In a method for monitoring the state of clogging and/or calcification of heat exchangers (4) in heating systems, follow-up operating data (temperatures T1' to T6', pump speeds np', ns') are sensed at regular intervals during the operation hereof and are compared with the original operating data (temperatures T1 to T6, pump speeds nP, ns) which were sensed in an initial state, e.g. upon initial start-up. In the event of a permissible deviation of the follow-up operating data from the original operating data being exceeded, which is usually attributable to clogging and/or calcification of the heat exchanger (4), a corresponding disruption signal is emitted. Corresponding to this method, a conventional heating system is provided with a monitoring device (28) by means of which clogging and/or calcification of the heat exchanger is automatically examined at regular intervals.
