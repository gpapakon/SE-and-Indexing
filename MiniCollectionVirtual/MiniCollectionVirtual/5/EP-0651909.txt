<ABSTRACT>
A superconductor that is free of Tl and may have a sharp transition from metallic to superconducting behaviour at temperatures up to about 80K at least is characterized by the formula (Pba(A)1-a)(SrbBa1-b)2(Cac(B)1-c)Cu2O7 in which at least half the (A) atoms are Hg and the remainder, if any, are selected from one or more of Zn, Cd, Tl, Sc, Mg, and Cu; (B) is selected from Y and the rare earth elements; a is from 0.3 to 0.7; b is from 0 to 1; and c is from 0.2 to 0.5 (all limits inclusive).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to new superconducting 
compositions and more particularly to superconducting 
ceramic compositions of the kind in which 
superconductivity is associated with a structure 
characterised by alternate layers approximating 
perovskite structure and rocksalt structure and having 
nominal compositions represented by the abbreviated 
formula 1-2-1-2. Representative superconductors of this 
kind that are now well established are (nominally) 
(Tl,Bi)(Sr,Ba)2(Ca,Y,RE)Cu2O7(Tl,Pb)(Sr,Ba)2(Ca,Y,RE)Cu2O7 
and 
(Pb,Cu)(Sr,Ba)2(Ca,Y,RE)Cu2O7.The compositions containing T1 have high critical 
temperatures but have major toxicity hazards while the 
Pb/Cu ones are difficult to prepare because they are 
susceptible to variations in oxygen content that have 
major effects on properties. Beales et al (Supercond. Sci. Technol. 5 47 (1992)) 
have put forward proposals to overcome these problems by 
using Cd-containing compositions some of which may be 
represented by the formula 
(Pb,Sn,Cd)Sr2(Ca,Mg,Sn,Ba,Y,RE)Cu2O7, 
but these have semiconducting, rather than metallic, 
properties above the superconducting temperature range 
and while they have promising critical temperature onset 
values (around 90K) they seem to have rather broad transitions 
with zero-resistance temperatures as low as 45K. Putilin et al (Mat Res Bull 26 1299-1307) report 
the preparation of 1-2-1-2 compositions using the metals 
Hg, Ba, RE, Cu, but found that they were not 
superconducting at any useful temperature. We have now discovered a new group of 
superconducting compositions which do not necessarily 
require the presence of Tl and at least some of which 
have sharp transitions between metallic and 
superconductive behaviour with zero-resistance  
 
temperatures up to about 80K. The superconductor in accordance with the invention 
is characterized by the formula 
(PbaA1-a) (SrbBa1-b)2(CacB1-c)Cu2O7 
in which at least half the A atoms are Hg and the 
remainder of the A atoms, if any, are selected from one 
or more of Cd, Tl and Cu; B is selected from Y and the 
rare earth elements; a is from 0.3 to 0.7; b is from 0 to 
1 (inclusive); and c is from about 0.2 to about 0.5. The 
oxygen content is, as usual, nominal only. We prefer that the A atoms do not include any Tl, 
and more especially that they include only Hg or Hg and 
Cd. Preferably B is Y. Peferably a is in the upper part of its range, 
namely from 0.4 to 0.7; more especially we prefer that a 
is about 0.5, so that the valency of the Cu (which 
diminishes as Hg(II) is
