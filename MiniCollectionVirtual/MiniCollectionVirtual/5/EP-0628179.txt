<ABSTRACT>
Yellowing of a processed photographic element is inhibited by incorporating a scavenger compound capable of reacting with magenta coupler, e.g. an epoxy compound, in a layer adjacent a layer containing the magenta coupler. In a preferred embodiment, the magenta coupler containing layer is sandwiched between layers containing the scavenger compound. Prior to processing at least one of these layers contains a solubilizing agent for the scavenger compound. In preferred embodiments, the processing solution used to process the photographic element containing an external solubilizing agent for the scavenger compound, preferably benzyl alcohol.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a silver halide
based color photographic element containing dye forming
couplers, more specifically to the incorporation of a
scavenger compound for residual magenta coupler in such
an element, and to a method of improving the resistance
to yellowing of a processed color photographic element.It is well known that thermal and
photochemical yellowing are major problems in image
stability of color prints. It is also known that
yellowing is caused by decomposition of residual
magenta coupler (i.e. coupler that has not reacted to
form dye) on exposure of the print to light and/or to
heat and humidity. Over the years significant
improvement in thermal and photochemical yellowing has
been achieved by introducing magenta couplers that are
less prone to yellowing. However, there still exists a
need to further improve the position with respect to
yellowing in color paper.It has been suggested that certain epoxy
compounds are able to undergo reaction with residual
magenta couplers and thereby effectively prevent both
thermal and photochemical yellowing since the products
of the reaction are not yellow and are not prone to
yellowing. See for example U.S. Patent No. 4,540,657
to Krishnamurthy and Japanese Patent Publication No.
62-131259 to Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd. The
incorporation of sparingly soluble epoxy compounds into
photographic elements for other purposes is also
disclosed in the art. See for example U.S. Patent No. 
4,900,655 to Nakazyo and European Patent Publication
No. 471,347 to Tomiyama. However, attempts to
incorporate such compounds in a photographic element in
the manner suggested in the art to prevent yellowing
have resulted in a loss of color density in the print.
There is therefore a need to devise a method for
inhibiting the thermal and photochemical yellowing in
color prints without reducing the color density of the
print.One aspect of this invention comprises a
multilayer color photographic element for use with a
processing solution containing an external solubilizing
agent comprising a support having coated thereon:
(a) a photosensitive first layer comprising
(i) a silver halide emulsion and(ii) a magenta coupler dispersed therein; and(b) a second layer comprising a scavenger compound
capable of reacting with the magenta coupler to
produce a product which is resistant to yellowing;
wherein at least one of said layers contains a pH
dependent solubilizing agent capable of dissolving the
scavenger compound at a pH above 8.The scavenger compound is preferably an epoxy
