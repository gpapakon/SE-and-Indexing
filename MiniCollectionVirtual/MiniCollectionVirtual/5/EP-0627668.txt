<ABSTRACT>
A nonmagnetic one-component toner is produced by the 
steps of applying inorganic fine particles having an 

average particle diameter of not less than 30 nm and less 
than 100 nm to the surface of the toner having a binder 

resin and a colorant; and removing agglomerations of the 
inorganic fine particles remaining unadhered on the toner 

surface using a cyclone in a gas stream. The inorganic 
fine particles used in the present invention have a 

particle diameter in suitable ranges, so that the 
resulting toner can have suitable powder fluidity, and 

that these inorganic fine particles are less likely to be 
embedded into the inner portion of the toner by the nip 

pressure exerted by such members as the charging blade. 
Therefore, by using the toner of the present invention, a 

nonmagnetic one-component developing system with small 
variations in image density and image quality after 

continuous copying can be provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a powdery toner used
for visualizing a latent image formed on a photoconductor
in electrophotography, electrostatic recording, etc., and
a method for producing such a toner. More particularly,
it relates to a toner suitable for a nonmagnetic
one-component developing method which can be conveniently
used for compact printers, plain paper facsimiles, etc.,
and a method for producing such a toner.In conventional methods in electrophotography,
electrostatic recordings, etc., as the most convenient
method for visualizing the latent image formed on the
photoconductor using a powdery toner, there have been
proposed two-component magnetic brush developing methods
using a developer consisting of two components, namely, a
toner and a carrier, the carrier being used for the
purposes of supplying electric charges to the toner and of
conveying the charged toner onto the latent image portion
by a magnetic force.However, in the two-component magnetic brush
developing method, since a magnetic force is utilized in 
the conveying of the developer, a magnet has to be placed
in the developer roller, and the carrier is made of a
metal or an oxide thereof such as iron powder, nickel
powder, and ferrite. Therefore, the developer device and
the developer become undesirably heavy, thereby making it
difficult to miniaturize and thus reduce the weight of the
overall recording device.On the other hand, as disclosed in US-A-3,909,258
and US-A-4,121,931 there have been conventionally
well used magnetic one-component developing methods
comprising the step of conveying a toner to the latent
image portion without using a carrier, the methods being
carried out by utilizing a magnetic force owned by the
toner containing a magnetic substance therein. However, a
magnet has to be also used in the inner portion of the
developer roll in this developing method, making it
difficult to reduce the weight of the developer device.In order to solve the problems in these developing
methods, much investigations have been recently conducted
on nonmagnetic one-component developing methods wherein a
toner alone is used without containing any magnetic
powder, as disclosed, for instance, in US-A-2,895,847
and US-A-3,152,012 and JP-B-41-9475, JP-B-45-2877 and
JP-B-54-3624.However, in the conventional nonmagnetic
one-component developing methods, since toners are
provided with electric charges only at an instant when the 
toner passes near the charging blade, the charging control
of the toner in these methods is extremely
