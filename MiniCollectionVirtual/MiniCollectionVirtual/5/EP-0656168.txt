<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for call
establishment in a cellular radio system comprising a
first mobile services switching centre, a cellular
radio system home location register for storing subscriber
and location data on subscribers in the cellular
radio system, a second mobile services switching
centre and a private branch exchange connected thereto,
within the service area of which subscribers are
located.Various cellular radio systems or mobile telephone
systems are in use and presently being designed
in which the geographical coverage area of the system
is divided into smaller separate radio areas, i.e.
cells, in such a way that when the radiotelephone or
mobile telephone is located in a cell, it communicates
with the fixed network through a fixed radio station
incorporated in the cell. The mobile telephones
belonging to the system can roam freely within the
system area from one cell to another. One such system
is the digital mobile telephone system GSM (Global
System for Mobiles).Cordless telephone (CT) systems, such as the
DECT system, have recently come out on the market. The
DECT system comprises a base station, which is normally
based on access to an existing fixed telephone
network. There are three main types of base stations:
a residential base station, a base station connected
to a private branch exchange in an office, and a
telepoint base station.Cordless telephone systems can also be connected 
to mobile telephone networks, for instance to the GSM
system. The private branch exchange (PBX) of a cordless
telephone system can be connected to the GSM
system for example by using DSS 1, Q.930-Q.940, 1989,
Digital Subscriber Signalling System No. 1, Network
Layer, User-Network Management, CCITT signalling
supplemented with mobility management messages. The
PBX of a cordless telephone system is connected to the
switching centre of the GSM system so that the subscribers
in the PBX can roam within the service area
of the GSM system, and the subscribers in the PBX can
make use of the mobility management procedures of the
GSM system and roam within the service area of DECT
systems connected to the GSM system. In such a case,
mobile subscribers are attached to the PBX in accordance
with the DECT radio path protocol ETS 300175,
Radio Equipment and Systems (RES), Digital European
Cordless Telecommunications (DECT), Common Interface,
for instance. It has also been possible to connect
fixed subscribers to the PBX, for example in accordance
with the ISDN signalling protocol. In that event,
calls

<CLAIMS>
A method for call establishment in a cellular
radio system comprising a first mobile services

switching centre (GMSC), a cellular radio system home
location register (HLR) for storing subscriber and

location data on subscribers (CPP) in the cellular
radio system, a second mobile services switching

centre (MSC) and a private branch exchange (PBX) connected
thereto, within the service area of which

subscribers (CPP) are located, 
characterized

by the following steps:

the home location register (HLR) of the cellular
radio system stores information (407) on whether the

subscriber (CPP) is located within the service area of
its home private branch exchange (PBX) indicated with

a home location area identifier;
the call to the subscriber and the telephone
number of the subscriber are routed to the first

mobile services switching centre (GMSC);
the first mobile services switching centre
(GMSC) requests (101) the home location register (HLR)

to provide routing information of the subscriber;
if the subscriber (CPP) is located within the
service area of its home private branch exchange

(PBX), in response to the routing information request
(101) placed by the first mobile services switching

centre (GMSC) the home location register (HLR) sends
(202) to the first mobile services switching centre

(GMSC) a roaming number containing the home location
area (PBX) identifier of the subscriber and having a

certain correspondence with the telephone number of
the subscriber;
the first mobile services switching centre
(GMSC) compares the roaming number of said subscriber 

(CPP) with the telephone number of the subscriber and,
in consequence, if said correspondence between the

roaming number and the telephone number of the subscriber
exists, the first mobile services switching

centre (GMSC) sends (203) an indication of the fact
that a call is to be routed to the subscriber and that

the subscriber is located within the service area of
its home private branch exchange (PBX) to the second

mobile services switching centre (MSC), which has
connection with the home private branch exchange (PBX)

within the service area of which the subscriber (CPP)
is located;
in response to said indication of the subscriber
being located within the service area of its home

private branch exchange sent (203) by the first mobile
service switching centre (GMSC), the second mobile

services switching centre (MSC) does not perform (Figure
3, 304) the mobility management functions (Figures
