<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is an ultrasonic scalpel blade (12) with a hook (40) and having flat, non-sharpened, relatively dull edges (30, 32) to improve ultrasonic coupling to adjacent tissue and afford exceptional coagulation and hemostasis. The blade with hook is particularly useful for cutting loose, unsupported tissue by grasping the tissue with the hook portion and tensioning it while cutting. The blade affords improved coagulation and hemostasis in loose, unsupported tissue, while simultaneously providing an improved cutting action.

<DESCRIPTION>
 ULTRASONIC SCALPEL BLADE AND METHODS OF APPLICATIONTECHNICAL FIELDThe present invention relates to ultrasonically energized scalpel blades and particularly- to blades having improved configurations for cutting and coagulating tissue.BACKGROUNDIn my prior application Serial No. 07/771,182, filed October 4, 1991, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, an ultrasonic surgical instrument is disclosed which includes an ultrasonic energy source in a handpiece ultrasonically coupled through an extension to a surgical tool, e.g., a surgical blade, at the tip of the blade extension whereby ultrasonic energy is transmitted from the ultrasonic energy source to the surgical blade and coupled with the tissue to which the blade is applied. That ultrasonic surgical blade achieved exceptional coagulation while cutting by reducing the sharpness and, consequently, increasing the dullness or bluntness of the blade, in comparison with standard sharp surgical blades. Prior to the discovery set forth in that application, it was believed that the same sharp blades used in hand-held surgical scalpels should be applied to ultrasonic surgical scalpels. It was discovered, however, that an otherwise dull blade, when coupled ultrasonically to tissue, enhances the sharpness of the blade when applied to incise and dissect, while simultaneously effecting coagulation. Generally, sharp blades pass through the tissue with less force and less tissue coupling and hence produce less 

coagulation. Thus, to achieve tissue coagulation and hemostasis, ultrasonic scalpel blades need not be as sharp as standard scalpel blades. In that prior application, the relationship between the type of tissue cut and the sharpness or dullness of the blade is set forth.DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTIONIt has been found, however, that dull blades do not cut particularly well through relatively loose and unsupported tissues, such as fat unless the tissues are supported against a hard surface (to afford effective cutting with simultaneous coagulation) . It has been discovered that an ultrasonic blade having a hook portion and formed sufficiently dull can provide both superior coagulation and effective cutting of loose and unsupported tissue. The hook portion of the ultrasonic blade engages the tissue as the blade is drawn along the tissue and allows the blade to grasp and tension the tissue (hence supporting the tissue) to enhance the cutting action. By stretching or tensioning the tissue, the otherwise dull blade is able to effectively cut as

<CLAIMS>
WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. An ultrasonic scalpel blade comprising:
a blade coupler having a blade body and a shank extending from said blade body for coupling with a source of ultrasonic energy and transmitting the- energy to said blade body;
said body having side edges and a tip opposite said shank, one of said side edges having a recess formed therein and defining a hook portion between said one side edge and. said tip for tensioning tissue as the blade is displaced along the tissue, thereby facilitating cutting and coagulation of the tissue upon application of ultrasonic energy to the tissue.
2. A blade according to Claim 1 wherein said tip has a flat, non-sharpened end surface.
3. A blade according to Claim 1 wherein said blade body has arcuate edges along each of its opposite side edges and tip, the arcuate edges along said tip and the side edge opposite said one side edge being convex and said arcuate edge along said one side edge forming said recess being concave.
4. A blade according to Claim 3 wherein said opposite side edges and said tip comprise flat, non-sharpened surfaces and said arcuate recessed edge comprises a sharpened edge.
5. A blade according to Claim 3 wherein said blade body has opposite side faces, said arcuate recessed edge forming an angle as said edge extends from one side face 


toward the opposite side face.
6. A blade according to Claim 5 wherein said angle is about 30째.
7. A blade according to Claim 5 wherein said angle is about 50째.
8. A blade according to Claim 5 wherein said angle lies within a range of 30-70째.
9. A blade according to Claim 1 wherein at least one of the side edges of said blade body extends laterally beyond the lateral extent of said shank.
10. A blade according to Claim 1 wherein the opposite side edges of said blade body extend generally linearly from said shank, with said recess formed through a portion of said one side edge.
11. A blade according to Claim 10 wherein the side edge opposite said one side edge includes an elongated sharpened edge.
12. A blade according to Claim 11 wherein said opposite side edge is sharpened to form facets along opposite side faces thereof forming an included angle of about at least about 44째.
13. A blade according to Claim 11 wherein said tip has a flat, linearly extending, non-sharpened end surface extending between said opposite side edges.
14. A blade according to Claim 1 in combination with a handle and an ultrasonic power element carried by 


said handle, and means for transmitting ultrasonic energy from said power element to said blade.
15. An ultrasonic scalpel blade comprising:
a blade coupler having a blade body and a shank extending from said blade body for coupling with a source of ultrasonic energy and transmitting the energy to said blade body;
said body having side faces, side edges and a tip opposite said shank, at least one of said side edges having non-sharpened flat edge surfaces extending linearly between opposite side faces of said blade and in a direction generally normal to said side faces to facilitate coagulation of the tissue upon application of ultrasonic energy to the blade and ultrasonically coupling the blade and tissue as the blade is displaced along the tissue.
16. A blade according to Claim 15 wherein said tip has a flat, linearly extending, non-sharpened end surface extending between said opposite side edges.
17. A method of incising and coagulating tissue comprising the steps of:
providing an ultrasonically actuated scalpel blade having side edges, a tip at an end of said blade and a hook along one of said side edges; and
simultaneously cutting and coagulating tissue by (i) applying the ultrasonically energized scalpel blade to the tissue and (ii) tensioning the tissue by engaging the tissue with said blade hook as the blade is drawn along 


the tissue.
