<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a purified 
isolated DNA fragment of 
Bacteroides
fragilis
 
comprising a sequence for an operon containing two 

genes designated 
rpr
X and 
rpr
Y. These genes encode 
two signal transducing regulatory proteins 

designated RprX and RprY. This invention further 
relates to the proteins RprX and RprY encoded by the 

operon. RprX and RprY affect the normal regulation 
of OmpF by OmpR and EnvZ
.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a purified 
isolated DNA fragment of Bacteroidesfragilis 
comprising a sequence for an operon containing two 
genes designated rprX and rprY. These genes encode 
two signal transducing regulatory proteins 
designated RprX and RprY. This invention further 
relates to the proteins RprX and RprY encoded by the 
operon. All cells are able to monitor and make 
appropriate adaptive responses to changes in their 
environment. Such adaptive responses in bacteria 
are often regulated by a multi-component signal 
transducing system. When exposed to the appropriate 
stimuli, a sensory receptor, generally an inner 
membrane protein, is activated to autophosphorylate 
a histidine residue. This high energy phosphate is 
transferred from the histidine to an aspartate 
residue on the second protein in the regulatory 
cascade, the regulatory response protein. It is the 
phosphorylated regulatory response protein that then 
mediates the adaptive response either by interacting 
with DNA, altering transcription, or with a specific 
protein(s), altering its activity. In addition to 
regulation at the level of phosphorylation, the 
amount of phosphorylated regulatory response protein 
is further controlled by associated phosphatases. Regulatory systems of this nature have  
 
been identified in over twelve diverse bacterial 
genera and have been found to regulate a variety of 
cellular processes including virulence and 
pathogenic determinants. (For a review see 
Bibliography entries 1,2). In Escherichiacoli (E. 
coli), it is predicted that there may be 50 
different pairs of signal transducing proteins. 
Some of these pairs include CheY, CheA and CheB, 
which are involved in the gliding versus tumbling 
response of bacteria in chemotaxis; PhoR and PhoB, 
which regulate phosphorus assimilation; and EnvZ and 
OmpR, which regulate outer membrane porin protein 
expression (2,3,4,5,6). Bacteroides fragilis is the major 
anaerobic bacterium comprising the bowel flora of 
man. Bacteroidesfragilis is also one of the major 
anaerobic bacteria isolated from anaerobic or mixed 
infections. As such, this bacterium produces 
various virulence factors which are involved in 
colonization and invasion of the organism. These 
factors include activities such as a nuraminidase. This invention relates to the cloning and 
identification of a pair of signal transducing 
regulatory proteins cloned from Bacteroidesfragilis, 
as well as to the phenotypes that 
expression of the regulatory proteins imparts upon 
E. coli. A
