<ABSTRACT>
A disc-shaped recording medium (21) is rotationally 
driven at a velocity equal to N times a rotational velocity of 

the medium corresponding to the data transfer rate of continuous 
input data, the input data are stored in a memory (30) having a 

storage capacity not less than a predetermined volume and data 
of the predetermined volume stored in the memory are converted 

into record data having a data transfer rate equal to N times the 
data transfer rate so that the produced record data will be 

continuously recorded on the disc-shaped recording medium.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved disc
recording/reproducing apparatus for recording data on
a disc-shaped recording medium. More particularly, it
relates to a data recording apparatus
which is strong against vibrations or the like.In a disc recording/reproducing apparatus for recording or
reproducing data on or from a disc-shaped recording medium, such
as a CD player for reproducing a compact disc, the compact disc
or the disc-shaped recording medium is rotationally driven at a
constant linear velocity (CLV) by a spindle motor, and a laser
beam is irradiated along a track formed spirally on the disc-shaped
recording medium, so that a music program (digital data)
recording as rows of pits on the track are reproduced by
detecting changes in intensity of the reflected light which are
caused by the presence or absence of the pits.On the other hand, the bit error rate at the time of data
reproduction in a CD player may reach an order of 10-5.Since an error detection code and an error correction code
are employed for correcting errors to a more or less extent, no
inconveniences may arise under ordinary operating environments.Meanwhile, in a car-laden CD player or a portable CD player,
extremely large vibrations may be produced, in a manner different
from a stationary type domestic CD player, such that servo
control may fall into disorder (deservoeing) due to an optical
head scanning a disc track deviating from the track (or being 
off-track) to interfere with normal data reproduction. In such
case, a music program cannot be reproduced satisfactorily because
error correction cannot be made or reproduction may be
interrupted even with the aid of the error detection code and the
error correction code.Thus, in a disc reproducing apparatus, such as a CD player
or video disc player, should the reproducing head be off-track
due to vibrations or the like, a problem is presented that
reproduction of a continuous information of a music program,
video program or the like is interrupted.For overcoming the problem, there is known a method
comprising providing a large capacity buffer memory, transiently
storing data reproduced by a reproducing head, such as music
program data, in the buffer memory, and outputting the data
stored in the buffer memory as playback data even when the
reproducing head is off-track for continuously reproducing the
music program. However, with this method, it is necessary to
store data previously in the buffer memory prior to reproduction
of the music program, so that music program

A data recording apparatus for continuously recording
inputted input data on a disc-shaped recording medium (21), the

apparatus comprising:

driving means (22) for rotationally driving said disc-shaped
recording medium (21) at a velocity equal to N times a

rotational velocity of the recording medium (21) corresponding
to the data transfer rate of said input data;
a recording head (23) for scanning said disc-shaped
recording medium (21) for recording data thereon;
storage means (30) for storing said input data in a
volume not less than a predetermined volume and comprising a

first memory and a second memory each having a storage capacity
of the input of the predetermined volume, the input data of the

predetermined volume being alternatively stored in said first
memory and said second memory;
data forming means (26, 27, 28, 35) for converting the
data of the predetermined volume in said storage means (30)

into record data having a data transfer rate equal to N times
said data transfer rate of said input data, and for supplying

the resulting data to said recording head (23);
control means (32) for controlling recording of the data
of the predetermined volume stored in the storage means (30) on

said disc-shaped recording medium (21) during the time of
storing data of a next predetermined volume in said storage

means (30) ; and
comparator means (25, 26, 27) for reproducing data
recorded on said disc-shaped recording medium (21), during the

time period which elapses since data stored in one memory of 
the memories of said storage means (30) is recorded on said

disc-shaped recording medium (21) until the next data stored in
the other memory is recorded on said disc-shaped recording

medium (21), and for comparing the reproduced data to the data
stored in said one memory.
The data recording apparatus according to claim 3,
wherein, when the results of comparison by said comparator

means differ, the data recorded in said one memory of said
storage means is recorded at the same recording position on

said disc-shaped recording medium.
The data recording apparatus according to claim 1 or 2
comprising selection means (29, 32) for storing the input data

in said storage means (30) and selecting if the transfer rate
should be changed.
The data recording apparatus according to claim 1, 2 or
3, wherein said control means (32) controls a scanning position

of said recording head (23) so that input data of the
predetermined volume stored in said storage means (30) are

recorded on said disc-shaped recording medium (21) during the
time of storing a predetermined volume of the next input data

in said storage means (30) and, after lapse of said time, the
next input data of the predetermined volume stored in said

storage means (30) are recorded at the next record target
position on said disc-shaped recording medium (21).
The data recording apparatus according to any preceding
claim, wherein the data of the predetermined volume is one-track

data on said disc-shaped recording medium.
