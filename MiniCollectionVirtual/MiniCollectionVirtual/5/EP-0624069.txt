<ABSTRACT>
Carrying system for carrying objects on the back comprising a hip belt (14) and a chest strap (1), and therebetween running inclined elastically stiffening straps (2) and/or springs (5) possibly containing stays to sideways stabilize and secure the chest strap in a correct position in relation to the hip belt. The carrying system may preferably be used for carrying backpacks and frame-carriers, and may also be adjusted in height for suiting the individual user. The carrying system may also be used in combination with conventional shoulder straps.

<DESCRIPTION>
 SYSTEM FOR CARRYING OBJECTS ON THE BACKThe present invention concerns a system for carrying objects # 5 on the back, especially rucksacks, backpacks or back frames,'* said system comprising carrier straps secured around the hip section of the user and around the chest section of the user.10 For people with deficiencies, diseases or disablements in the neck and shoulder area it has previously not existed any carrier system which has been suited to secure objects such as rucksacks or back frames to their backs so that these objects without problems might be carried, and the known15 carrier constructions often provoke great pain for these groups of people. Generally a sense of tiredness and tenderness in the shoulder area will arise in all people when using the previously known carrier systems. The carrier constructions of today is contemplated to give the20 main load to the shoulders of the user and often consist only of shoulder straps (regular sacks) or comprise additionally also load-supporting hip straps. Such hip straps may not, however, and are not intended to, relieve the shoulder straps completely.25It has previously been made attempts to produce carrier systems for backpacks making the user able to remove the backpack rapidly. It is thus known from US patent 4.307.826 a system where the backpack may be placed in sockets in a30 carrier frame, and where the backpack is stabilized by the aid of a breast strap. In this carrier system the total weight is, however, transferred to the hip area, and s stabilization of the backpack is in the best case incom-' plete, since it will be necessary with a very hard tighten- v 35 ing of the breast strap to prevent the backpack to be displaced sideways. Additionally this carrier system is not suited for women for obvious anatomical reasons. 

The purpose of the present invention is thus to produce a carrier system which removes the weight load from the shoulder area of the user, is comfortable in use and is stable. The system according to the invention is also non- discriminating, is very user-friendly and is indeed all- around useful. The advantage with the present carrier system compared to the previously known carrier devices, is that the user is here allowed the opportunity to individu¬ ally choose the carrier principle which is best suited.The invention will be more closely explained below, with reference to the enclosed figures, wherein:Fig. 1 shows an embodiment of the carrier system in combination with a conventional backpack observed from the side,
