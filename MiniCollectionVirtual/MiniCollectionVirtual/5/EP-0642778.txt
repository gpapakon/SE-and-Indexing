substantially integral fibrous layer of hydrophilic fibers; and 

a quantity of superabsorbent particles integrally mixed among

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an absorbent article
of the type as described in
EP
313 800. In this document a disposable diaper is disclosed
having a fibrous absorbent layer and absorbent
particles dispersed within the fibrous layer. The absorbent
layer comprises a thickened portion arranged in the
middle of the diaper between the two waistband portions.
This thickened portion includes both an increased
amount of fibres and an increased amount of superabsorbent
particles, while both the amount of superabsorbent
particles and fibres decreases towards both
waistband portions.Further absorbent articles, such as disposable
infant diapers, feminine care products, incontinence
garments and the like, have included high absorbency
superabsorbent polymers to increase the absorbent
capacity of the article and to reduce the bulkiness of the
article. For example, see U.S.P. 3,669,103 to Harper,
U.S.P. 3,670,731 to Harmon, and U.S.P. 4,087,506 to
Cook et al. Particular absorbent article designs have
concentrated superabsorbent polymers in selected
regions of the absorbent pad. For example, see U.S.P.
4,381,782 to Mazurak et al., U.S.P. 4,410,324 to Sabee
and U.S.P. 4,461,621 to Karami et al.. In some of these
conventional arrangements, the high absorbency material,
such as superabsorbent polymer, have been substantially
uniformly mixed with absorbent fibers located
within selected layers, or strips. In other arrangements,
the high absorbency material has been substantially
isolated in layers, zones or pockets within the absorbent
pad with the high absorbency material substantially
unmixed with the absorbent fibers.Various devices and processes have been
employed to manufacture absorbent article designs. Air
forming techniques for forming webs of hydrophilic fibers,
such as woodpulp fibers, are well known in the art.
In addition, it is well known that superabsorbent polymers
may be mixed with the hydrophilic fibers during an
airlaying process to form an absorbent web. For example,
see the Sanyo Technical Bulletin entitled "SAP
SHEET', dated October 1982.Particular absorbent article designs have particles
of superabsorbent polymer localized in selected
regions. For example, U.S.P. 3,888,257 issued June 10,
1975 to R. Cook et al. describes a disposable absorbent
article in which a rectilinear, central zone of a matrix of
fiberized woodpulp incorporates a 3-dimensional dispersion
of hydro-colloid polymer particles. U.S.P.
4,381,782 issued May 3, 1983 to P. Mazurak et al.
describes an absorbent article wherein

<CLAIMS>
An absorbent article, comprising:

a substantially integral fibrous layer of hydrophilic fibers; and
a quantity of superabsorbent particles integrally mixed among said fibers in a
non-layered configuration, and arranged with weight percentages of said

superabsorbent particles (10) with respect to a total weight of superabsorbent,
nonuniformly distributed along a length dimension of said article, wherein

selected cross-directionally extending, superabsorbent-containing regions which
are positioned along the length of said fibrous layer have higher percentages of

superabsorbent than other cross-directionally extending, superabsorbent-containing
regions positioned along the length of said fibrous layer,

wherein the weight percentage amount of said superabsorbent does not change
in a substantially direct correspondence with a length-wise change in a local

basis weight of said hydrophilic fibers; and

wherein said quantity of superabsorbent particles is distributed along said
fibrous layer length in a particle distribution profile having a general shape of

an inverted spoon with a bowl section (250) having relatively higher
concentrations of superabsorbent particles and a handle section (252) having

relatively lower concentrations of superabsorbent, said bowl section positioned
toward a front waistband edge of said absorbent article.
An absorbent article according to claim 1, further comprising:

a backsheet (220); and
