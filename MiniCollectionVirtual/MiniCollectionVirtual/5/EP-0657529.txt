<CLAIMS>
Process for purifying microbially produced dihydroxyacetone in
coloured fermentation solutions, 
characterized in that
 the clear
coloured fermentation broth which has been cleared of coarse

components and which contains the microbially produced
dihydroxyacetone in soluble form is filtered through a membrane

having a cut-off of from 200 to 300 U (200-300 dalton) and the
dihydroxyacetone is isolated from the uncoloured eluate.
