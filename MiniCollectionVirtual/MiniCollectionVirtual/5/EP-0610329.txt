<CLAIMS>
A circuit for the continuous zoom adjustment of the
picture width in a television receiver having a line output

stage, line scanning coils (5) and a tangential capacitor
(Cs) arranged in the path of the scanning current,

characterised by the following features:

a) a second capacitor (Cs2) is arranged in series with the
tangential capacitor (Cs1) and a switch (S), which is

closed for an adjustable time by a switching voltage
(P) commencing at the line centre (tm), is arranged in

parallel with the second capacitor (Cs2)

or
b) a second capacitor (Cs2) is arranged in parallel with
the tangential capacitor (Cs1) and a switch (S), which

is closed for an adjustable time by a switching voltage
(P) commencing at the line centre (tm), is arranged in

series with the second capacitor (Cs2).
A circuit according to Claim 1, characterised in that
the tangential capacitor (Cs1) and/or the second capacitor

(Cs2) is transformer-coupled to the path of the scanning
current.
A circuit according to Claim 2, characterised in that
the capacitors (Cs1, Cs2) are arranged in series with the

secondary winding (10) of a transformer (Tr2) whose primary
winding (9) is arranged in the path of the scanning current.
A circuit according to Claim 3, characterised in that
one end of the secondary winding (10) is connected to the

centre point (11) of the series connection of two freewheeling
diodes (D5, D6) arranged in parallel with the line

output stage transformer (Tr1). 
A circuit according to Claim 3, characterised in that
the line high voltage transformer (Tr1) is used as

transformer.
A circuit according to Claim 1, characterised in that
the switch
ing voltage (P) is derived from the output of a
comparator circuit (T4) to which are applied the sum of the

parabolic voltage (Ucs) across the tangential capacitor (Cs)
and an adjustable d.c. voltage (U2) as well as a fixed

reference d.c. voltage (Uz).
A circuit according to Claim 6, characterised in that
the comparator circuit contains a transistor (T4), the base

of which is connected via a capacitor (12) to the tangential
capacitor (Cs) and also to the tapping of an adjustable

voltage divider (14, 15) supplied with a d.c. voltage, to
the emitter of which a reference voltage (+Uz) stabilized

with a Zener diode (Z) is applied, and from the collector of
which the switching voltage (P) is derived.
A circuit according to Claim 1, characterised in that
the switch (S) is formed by the parallel connection of a

MOSFET transistor (T3) and a diode (D4).
