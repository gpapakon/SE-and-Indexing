<ABSTRACT>
An ink jet printing device has a drop 
generator for producing continuous streams of ink 

drops from at least one orifice and further has 
stimulation control electronics for maintaining 

desired stimulation conditions in response to a 
feedback from the drop generator. First and second 

feedback transducers measure the stimulation 
amplitude in the drop generator and generate 

feedback output signals in response to the 
stimulation. The feedback output signals are 

approximately equal in magnitude and opposite in 
sign to each other when the stimulation amplitude in 

the drop generator is a desired stimulation mode. 
An amplifier, whose inputs are the feedback output 

signals, provides an amplifier output signal to the 
stimulation control electronics which is the 

difference between the two feedback output signals.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to ink jet 
printing systems and, more particularly, to an 
improved means for monitoring the stimulation in the 
drop generator of an ink jet printing system. In continuous ink jet printing, graphic 
reproduction is accomplished by selectively charging 
and deflecting drops from the drop streams and 
depositing at least some of the drops on a print 
receiving medium while other of the drops strike a 
drop catcher device. In order to provide precise 
charging and deflecting of the drops, it is 
important that the drop break-up process produce 
uniformly sized and timed drops. Drop generators 
for such printers produce the required drop 
formation by vibrating the orifices from which the 
ink emerges. In U.S. Patent No. 4,473,830, a feedback 
transducer was utilized for monitoring the vibration 
amplitude. The drive amplitude for the drop 
generator was servo controlled to maintain the 
proper feedback amplitude. Co-pending, commonly 
assigned U.S. Patent 5 465 109 (published 7/11/95) 
and 5 502 474 (published 26/03/96) 
further employ this feedback signal to 
insure that the drive signal tracks the resonance of 
the drop generator and to provide the proper phasing 
of the drop charging electronics with respect to the 
stimulation. These stimulation control means function  
 
appropriately when the feedback signal has a sufficient 
signal-to-noise ratio. In the field of ink jet printers, 
however, it is desirable from the standpoint of throughput 
to utilize long arrays of ink jets. Unfortunately, the 
signal-to-noise ratio tends to be degraded in ink jet 
printers having long arrays and high resonant frequency. 
Long arrays of jets have more charging electrodes which 
must be rapidly switched between ground potential and high 
voltage. These switching transients produce electrical 
noise which can be picked up at the input to the 
stimulation control electronics. Even with careful 
shielding and filtering, the electrical noise picked up by 
the stimulation control electronics can affect the 
stimulation drive amplitude and frequency. Higher 
frequency drop generators tend to have lower feedback 
signal amplitudes, further reducing the signal-to-noise 
ratio. A fluid jet system for a printer is described in EP-A-0126536, 
wherein a pair of piezoelectric elements are 
mounted on a stimulator member of an ink jet orifice plate 
and provide an electrical feedback signal proportional in 
frequency and amplitude to acoustic waves traveling through 
the stimulator member. This
