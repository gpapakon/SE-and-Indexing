<ABSTRACT>
To facilitate manufacture, the brush tufts (111) are fitted 
to flat sections (103) which are then bent to form the desired 

three-dimensional configuration of the sections (103). The final 
shape of the brush is maintained by connecting together locking 

portions (105, 108).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the manufacture of
brushware products and, preferably, to such products
which are constructed of a single raw material so that
the finished product may be recycled when it is no longer
functional. The brushware product is intended to be
constructed from a minimum of material and provide brush
tufts radiating inwardly or outwardly from a curved
surface.Many different types of brushes have been devised
over the years from an original tree branch or shrub
branch, and developing into wire-set, anchor-set, staple-set,
twisted-in-wire and resin-set designs. These
designs include both natural and synthetic filament
materials. There was also developed a method of fusing
like materials such as polypropylene monofilament into a
molded section of polypropylene to form a basic brushware
configuration. Many prior patents invented by John C.
Lewis, Jr., the inventor herein, disclose different
variations and improvements in this overall concept.
Representative of such patents are U.S. Patents No.
3,604,043; 4,189,189; 4,291,431; 4,348,060; 4,690,277;
and 4,693,519, the disclosures of which are hereby
incorporated by reference. These patents in general
disclose tufted fused brush construction and mat-like 
devices wherein synthetic tufts are fused to molded base sections. There is no disclosure,
however, therein of a brush or broom construction which can be obtained from a flat
mat projection of the resulting three-dimensional object. The patents do disclose
methods for tufting articles which methods may he used to form the constructions of this
invention.In U.S. Patent No. 5,114,214, there is described an effort to me a toothbrush
having tufts set in brush sections which are separated by attenuation grooves. The patent
describes a process for heating the grooves so that the brush sections may be bent to
form a radial or other type of surface wherein each section is disposed at an angle to
adjacent sections but each individual section is contained in a single plane. Also in U.S.
Patents No. 5,224,763 and 4,988,146 there are described different means for forming a
brush construction wherein the tuft end is melted and then set in a cavity of heat-softened
material. In Patent No. 5,224,763, a collar is provided around the cavity
which, in turn, is swaged to secure the tuft in the cavity. Also, in Patent No. 4,988,146,
the cavity is heat softened and may be formed in a variety of different geometric
designs. These patents, however, also do not describe the means for making a three-dimensional
body

<CLAIMS>
A brush preassembly construction comprising:

a sheet (100, 301) of material configured as a two-dimensional projection of a
predetermined three-dimensional brush design (100', 200, 300, 411, 500'), said design

including a three-dimensional tufted surface, said sheet having a first surface on which
are mounted a plurality of mutually spaced brush tufts (111, 208, 307, 410, 511)

disposed at preselected sites thereon, said tufts covering at least a portion of said sheet,
said portion being configured as a two-dimensional projection of said three-dimensional

tufted surface; and
assembly means (105, 108, 202, 202''', 403, 404, 503, 504) carried by said
sheet for assembling said sheet into said three-dimensional brush design;

characterized in that:
said sheet includes at least two integrally-connected sections (103, 200', 201,
302, 400, 401, 500, 501) between which there is at least one gap (G) having opposed

side edges (109', 202, 202''', 304, 304', 403, 404, 503, 504) which are curved; and
said assembly means (105, 108, 202, 202''', 403, 404, 503, 504) is arranged to
close said or each gap by joining together said opposed curved side edges thereof, so as

to assemble said sheet into said three-dimensional brush design.
The construction of claim 1, wherein said tufts (111, 208, 307, 410, 511) and
sheet (100, 301) are of the same thermoplastic material.
The construction of claim 1 or 2, wherein said first surface of said sheet has
raised sites (104, 206) to which are fused prefused ends (112) of said tufts.
The construction of any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein said assembly means
includes a slot (202''') and a bead (202) provided on respective ones of said opposed

curved side edges of said or each gap (G). 
The construction of any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein said assembly means
includes a projection (105) molded on a surface of said sheet (100) and a hole (108)

provided through each section (103) of said sheet for receiving said projection.
A method for forming a three-dimensional hollow tufted construction (100',
200, 300, 411, 500'), comprising the steps of:


providing a sheet (100, 301) configured as a two-dimensional projection of said
three-dimensional tufted construction, said construction including a three-dimensional

surface, wherein said sheet includes at least two integrally-connected sections (103,
200', 201, 302, 400, 401, 500, 501) between which there is at least one gap (G) having

opposed side edges (109', 202, 202''', 304, 304', 403, 404, 503, 504) which are
curved;
mounting brush tufts (111, 208, 307, 410, 511) on a first surface of said sheet at
predetermined sites (104, 206, 306, 408, 508) on said sections, which are configured as

a two-dimensional projection of said three-dimensional surface; and
closing said or each gap (G) by joining together said opposed curved side edges
(109', 202, 202''', 304, 304', 403, 404, 503, 504) thereof, so as to form said three-dimensional

hollow tufted construction.
The method of claim 6, wherein in said construction said tufts (208, 307) are
radially inwardly directed from said three-dimensional surface.
The method of claim 7, wherein the outer surface (200'') of said construction
functions as a handle portion.
The method of claim 6, wherein in said construction said tufts (111, 410, 511)

The method of any one of claims 6 to 9, wherein said opposed curved side edges
of said or each gap (G) are joined by inserting a bead (202) provided on one of said
