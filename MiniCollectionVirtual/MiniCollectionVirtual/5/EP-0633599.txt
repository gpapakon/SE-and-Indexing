<ABSTRACT>
A collimator having a particle getter function, and a 
thin-film forming apparatus equipped with the collimator 

disposed between a target and a wafer. The collimator is 
fabricated by assembling particle getter sheets into a 

lattice, honeycomb, or other structure having a number of 
rows of openings and fixing the assembly into a frame. The 

particle getter sheets refers collectively to sheets and 
plates to be assembled integrally to provide a surface having 

excellent particle capturing and holding actions. Typically, 
the collimator is a lattice assembly of embossed, slitted 

particle getter sheets. The film deposited on the collimator 
is kept from peeling off, without deteriorating the 

collimator performance.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a thin-film forming apparatus,
and more specifically to a thin-film forming apparatus
provided with a collimator having a particle getter function
and designed to be held between a film forming source and a
substrate. This invention also relates to a collimator for a
thin-film forming apparatus composed of particle getter
sheets.Vapor phase film growth technology has been widely used in
forming many different thin films, e.g., thin films for the
electrodes and diffusion barriers of integrated circuits,
magnetic films for magnetic recording media, and clear
conductive films of indium-tin oxide (ITO) for liquid crystal
display units. Thin film formation techniques based upon this
vapor phase film growth principle include chemical vapor phase
growth methods such as thermal decomposition, hydrogen
reduction, disproportionation reaction and plasma chemical
vapor deposition (CVD); physical vapor phase methods such as
vacuum vapor deposition, sputtering and ion beam techniques;
and further discharge polymerization method. In sputtering process, for example, a target and a
substrate such as a wafer are located opposite to each other,
and atoms released from the target by sputtering deposit on
the substrate to form a thin film over it. With the recent
increases in degrees of integration of electronic devices,
diverse techniques for thin film formation have been required.
To cite one example, wafers having deep pits sometimes need
to be coated with a uniform film, even on the bottom surface
of each pit. In ordinary sputtering, as shown at (a) in FIG.
1, a majority of sputtered atoms are scattered aslant with
respect to the wafer surface. They are unable to travel deep
into the pit but deposit mostly around the inlet opening of
the pit, and so it is impossible to form a uniform film
extending to the bottom of a deep pit.Under such circumstances, a technique called as
collimation sputtering was proposed (see, e.g.,
JP-A-03 123 021 and EP-A-0 313 750. It uses a
collimator disposed between a substrate on which a film is
to be formed and a film forming source held opposite to the
substrate in a vacuum film forming apparatus wherein the
collimator allows to pass sputtered atoms therethrough only in
the direction perpendicular to the surface of the substrate
so that a strongly directional film forming can be performed.
In collimation sputtering, as at (b) in FIG. 1, the
collimator captures obliquely scattering atoms and passes only 
the atoms sputtered perpendicularly to the wafer surface.
