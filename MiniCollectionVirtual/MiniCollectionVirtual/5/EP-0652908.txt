<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the present invention is polyamide compounds containing, in relation to the polyamide compounds, 0.1 to 1 wt % terephthalic dialdehyde and/or its acetals of C1-C4 alcohols and possibly 3 to 30 wt % melamine and/or melamine cyanurate, and a process for producing the polyamides and a process for increasing the shock resistance, Charpy impact resistance and viscosity of flameproof, halogen-free polyamides and a process for increasing the mol masses of polyamide compounds.
