<ABSTRACT>
A loudspeaker diaphragm has a surround (11) comprising 
vibratile material extending between an inner circle and an 

outer circle. The material has a thin complient roll (13) 
near the outer circle and an outer circular bead (14) 

inside of and near the thin compliant roll (13). An inner 
ridge (15) having both radial and tangential components 

extends between the inner circle and the outer circular 
bead (15). The width of the outer circular bead (14) and 

the inner ridge (15) is significantly less than the 
diameter of the outer circle. The attachment area between 

the cone body and the surround covers a substantial area of 
the cone body.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to
loudspeaker driver surrounding and more particularly
concerns novel structure and techniques for improving
loudspeaker driver performance with a novel surround shape
which overlaps the diaphragm over much of its surface area and starts
from EP-A-0 492 914.An important goal of loudspeaker designers has been
to provide a single loudspeaker driver characterized by
substantially uniform acoustical energy output as a
function of frequency over substantially the full frequency
range. One prior art approach involved attaching a high
compliance roll at the edge of a rigid cone body to improve
the low frequency response. This approach not only does
not correct irregularities in the high frequency response,
but may even exacerbate midrange anomalies. Another
approach uses driver cone materials of increased stiffness
(modulus of elasticity) to increase high frequency output,
but with increased irregularity in response.It is an important object of the invention to
provide a practically manufacturable driver characterized
by a substantially uniform frequency response over a wide
range of audio frequencies.It is known that increasing the driver motor
strength (BL)2/RE, where B = motor gap magnetic field
strength, L = length of voice coil wire in that gap, RE =
resistance of voice coil, increases the acoustical output
of spectral components in the middle range of audio
frequencies relative to the bass frequencies. Adding mass
to the cone of a driver with high motor strength according
to the invention reduces the midrange response to
substantially the level of the bass response and extends
the fundamental mass-compliance resonance of the system to
lower bass frequencies. In embodiments of the invention,
this mass is typically two to five times greater than that 
of a prior art driver. According to the another aspect of
the invention, damping material is comolded with the
flexible part of the surround from a material that has
suitable flexibility and internal damping properties, this
damping material being at the junction of the surround roll
and cone body. According to still another feature of the
invention, material with appropriate locations on the
surface of the cone body to achieve smooth extended highfrequency
power response.In a specific form of the invention adding mass,
providing an edge damping ring and distributing damping
material over the surface of the cone in a single molded
elastomeric surround which is laminated to the cone body
over a substantial portion of
