<CLAIMS>
Device for optically scanning a recording medium, in 
particular a phosphor storage disc, with a scanning head 

(10) which is movable relative to the recording medium (12) 
and which contains a scanning beam path along which a 

scanning beam (30) strikes a predetermined scanning 
location (32) past which the recording medium can be moved 

by the relative movement, and a mirror-optics imaging 
system which essentially focuses, in an image plane, 

effective radiation which is produced by the scanning beam 
(30) at the scanning location (32), and with a photodetector 

(24) which is arranged in the path of the effective 
radiation at a distance behind the image plane, characterised 

in that the imaging system is formed by a reflective 
inner surface (14) of a cavity which has the form of an 

elongate ellipsoid or two mutually opposed paraboloids and 
at axially opposed ends comprises a light input opening 

(16) or a light output opening (18). 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
cavity (14) has the form of an ellipsoid of revolution. 
Device according to claim 1, 2 or 3, characterised in 
that the plane of the input opening (16) extends obliquely 

to the longitudinal axis of the cavity. 
Device according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the scanning head (10) comprises an 

opening (28) extending obliquely to the longitudinal axis 

of the cavity for the scanning beam (30). 
Device according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that between the output opening (18) of 

the cavity (14) and the photodetector (24) is arranged a 
cavity (20) which widens in the direction of propagation of 

the radiation. 
Device according to claim 5, characterised in that the  
 

walls of the cavity are concave in cross-section. 
Device according to claim 5 or 6, characterised in that 
the wall (22) of the widening cavity (20) is reflective. 
Device according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the scanning beam path (30) extends 

obliquely to the longitudinal axis of the mirror system 
(14) and in that the recording medium (12) is mounted 

inclined towards the scanning beam path relative to the 
longitudinal axis of the mirror system.
