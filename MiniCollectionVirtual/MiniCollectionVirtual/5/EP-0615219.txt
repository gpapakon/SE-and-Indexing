<ABSTRACT>
Display structure for variable-message color panels, 
comprising a supporting framework, including a plurality of 

modular surfaces that are arranged side by side and can be 
moved according to a program on a display plane, like the 

tesserae of a mosaic, each modular surface bearing a 
digitized monochrome portion to form composite images 

obtained by the combination of a preset number of modular 
surfaces, as well as elements for positioning the modular 

surfaces, and program-controlled elements for controlling 
the positioning elements.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a display structure 
for variable-message color panels. As is known, information panels for advertising or 
other purposes usually have a single information message 
which is replaced when required by specialized personnel. 
Panels including rotating prisms, in which each prism 
supports a vertical or horizontal slice of the panel, have 
recently become popular, and at least two different 
messages can thus be accessed in the same space by each 
panel. Although this construction with prism-like elements 
allows to provide multiple displays, it requires 
specialized personnel for the replacement and setup of the 
image or message to be installed on the panel. Ribbon-like information panels that bear images 
usually directly joined to other images are also known, 
especially in the sports advertising field. In this case, 
too, each portion of the panel contains a complete non-modifiable 
image which accordingly must be replaced 
completely in case the message or part of it is to be 
changed. In the prior art, a message illustration system is 
known from US patent no. 4,733,487 in the name of Gassmann, 
which has a series of strings of preset characters arranged 
along mutually perpendicular rows and columns, with sliding 
selection sliders that can define a message to be 
displayed. US patent no. 4,986,014 in the name of Gassmann 
discloses a message illustration system provided with a  
 
belt that supports cross-like elements that form a 
supporting surface for portions of panels that can be 
arranged mutually adjacent on an appropriate display 
surface. In both cases, these are solutions for advertising 
panels that however have severe operation problems as 
regards rapid adaptability to the requirements of 
communication, on-site use of specialized personnel and 
high investment costs. An aim of the present invention is to eliminate or 
substantially reduce the drawbacks described above by 
providing a display structure for variable-message color 
panels that can dispense with any permanent or 
semipermanent physical link between the image to be 
displayed and the surface of the panel. Another object of the present invention is to provide 
a display structure that allows on the one hand to form a 
very large number of preselected images and on the other 
hand allows to display said images rapidly even according 
to sudden and occasional requirements without any 
intervention of personnel at the site where the display 
structure is installed. Another object of the

<CLAIMS>
A display structure for variable-message color 
panels, comprising a supporting framework, characterized in 

that it has a plurality of modular surfaces that are 
arranged side by side and can be moved according to a 

program on a display plane, like the tesserae of a mosaic, 
each modular surface bearing a digitized monochrome portion 

to form composite images obtained by the combination of a 
preset number of modular surfaces, as well as means for 

positioning the modular surfaces, and program-controlled 
means for controlling the positioning means. 
A display structure according to claim 1, 
characterized in that said modular surfaces are arranged on 

a plurality of flexible belts. 
A display structure according to claim 2, 
characterized in that each flexible belt is supported and 

guided at one end by a pair of display rollers which is 
arranged at the display plane to display a modular surface 

and by a movement sprocket roller at its rear end. 
A display structure according to claim 3, 
characterized in that said actuation means comprise a 

gearmotor unit for each belt, meant to rotate either the 
sprocket roller or at least one of the display rollers. 
A display structure according to claim 4, 
characterized in that each gearmotor unit comprises a step 

motor and a reader for reading a reference position of the 
belt which is electrically connected to the control means. 
A display structure according to claim 4, 
characterized in that each gearmotor unit comprises a 

 
direct-current motor and an encoder for detecting the 

position of the belt which is connected to the control 
means. 
A display structure according to claim 3, 
characterized in that said actuation means comprise an 

electromagnet-keeper assembly for each belt, a pair of 
sprocket rollers for transmitting the motion between the 

keeper and the sprocket roller, and pawl means for the one-way 
rotation for a cylinder and for the sprocket roller. 
A display structure according to claim 7, 
characterized in that said pair of cylinders is elastically 

loaded so as to move away from the electromagnet. 
A display structure according to any one of claims 
3 or 4 to 8, characterized in that said display plane is 

formed by subgroups, each of which is formed by a plurality 
of flexible belts arranged on top of each other between two 

lateral supporting walls, and by modules that are 
individually formed by the adjacent arrangement of a 

plurality of subgroups. 
A display structure according to any one of claims 
4 to 9, characterized in that the side walls of each 

subgroup support a control board for the motor units 
present in the subgroup. 
A display structure according to claim 9 or 10, 
characterized in that each module has a control board which 

is connected to the various control boards of the gearmotor 
units and to the control means. 
A display structure according to claim 11, 
characterized in that each module comprises a supporting 

plate for the respective control board, provided with 
 

lateral coupling lugs. 
A display structure according to claim 11 or 12, 
characterized in that said program-based control means 

comprise a local processor for the or each panel said 
processor being connected to each control board, a control 

center, and a modem for connecting the or each local 
processor to the control center by means of a telephone 

line to receive the code of the images to be displayed with 
the sequence and the display times for each individual 

image. 
A display structure according to claim 11, 
characterized in that the control center includes a scanner 

which is suitable to acquire images to be displayed, and a 
printer for printing drafts of images processed by the 

scanner. 
A display structure according to any one of the 
preceding claims 13 or 14, characterized in that said 

supporting framework comprises a plurality of double-hinge 
posts for the detachable fixing of the coupling lugs of the 

supporting plates of each module, so as to support the 
individual modules in a cantilevered manner and allow their 

removal from the structure independently of each other.
