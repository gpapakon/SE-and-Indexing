<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a three-pole fused element for fitting directly onto busbar systems, which fuse element is completely encapsulated by a housing (1). The terminals of the outlet lines (20) are located at a level in the region of the lower end (17) of the housing (1). A plurality of ventilation slots (18, 19) are arranged in the region of the two housing ends. In order to cover the terminal screws and a channel-like depression (13), into which a latching lever projects having a bend (14) for fixing the fuse element on the busbars, to provide protection against electric shocks, covering flaps (28, 29) which can pivot are provided in the vicinity of the housing ends. The fuse element makes it possible to connect the outlet lines easily and safely, while providing improved electric shock protection, heating the element in use being avoided.

A three-pole fuse element being completely encapsulated 
by a housing for direct attachment to power supply bar 

systems comprising 

a springy or resilient notch arm (9) for form-fit locking 
of said fuse element to one of the power supply bars 

wherein all terminals of the output leads (20) in the 
region of the lower front side (17) of the housing (1) 

are placed at one level and several vent holes (18, 19) 
arranged both in the region of the upper front side (8) 

of the housing and in the region of the lower front side 
(17) of the housing as well, 
wherein swingable cover flaps (28, 29) are arranged for 
coverage of terminal screws (22) of output terminals (21) 

and/or of a channel-like recess (13) for a disengaging 
arm (12) for said notch arm (9), 
wherein said cover flaps (28, 29) have swivel axes 
consisting of two coaxially aligned projections (31, 32) 

attached to each cover flap (28, 29), said projections 
having pyramidal tips directed towards each other, said 

tips being engaged into corresponding pyramidal recesses 
(33, 34) of the opposed bearing (35) at the housing (1). 
The fuse element according to claim 1, characterized in 
that said output terminals are formed as box terminals 

(21) having terminal screws (22) which are accessible 
from the front side, wherein said terminal screws (22) 

are arranged all insulated in a depression of said 
housing (1) . 
The fuse element according to claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that
 
said notch arm (9) held swingable and resilient in the  

 
locking position is arranged close to the upper front 

side (8) of the housing (1) for form-fit locking with the 
upper power supply bar and that said disengaging arm (12) 

which is operatable from the outside projects into the 
outer channel-like recess (13) of the upper front side 

(8) of the housing (1). 
The fuse element according to claim 1, characterized in 
that
 
said cover flaps (28, 29) are supported to snap from the 

open to the closed position and vice versa and take a 
stable position in their end positions. 
The fuse element according to claim 1 or 3, characterized 
in that 


said swivel axis of said cover flaps (28, 29) consists of 
two coaxially directed projections (31, 32) having 

conical or cone-shaped peaks directed toward each other 
said projections engage into corresponding cone-shaped 

depressions (33, 34) of said housing (1) or said support 
axis (35), respectively, 
wherein two flattenings (36, 37) standing rectangular to 
each other are arranged in a horizontal or vertical 

position at said housing (1) or said support axis (35), 
respectively, and against which the lower edge (30) of 

said cover flaps (28, 29) rests in the closed or in the 
open position. 
The fuse element according to one of the claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that said upper cover flap (28) projects 

in closed condition approximately with a pushing distance 
of the fuse element from said power supply bars beyond 

the upper front side (8) of said housing, while the lower 
cover flap (29) occludes in the closed condition flush 

with the lower front side (17) of said housing. 
The fuse element according to one of the claims 1 to 6,  
 

characterized in that striplike breakable projections (7) 
are arranged on attachment feet (6) for adjustment to the 

thickness of the respective power supply bar.
