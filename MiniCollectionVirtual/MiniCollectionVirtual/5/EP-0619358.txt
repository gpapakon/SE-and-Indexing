molecule and (B) 0.0001 to 10,000 parts by weight of a 
photochromic compound. The compound (A) is of formula 


   wherein A is a residue of an n-valent alcoholic hydroxylcontaining 
compound, a residue of an n-valent phenolichydroxyl-containing 

compound, or a residue of an n-valent 
carboxylic acid, R¹ is hydrogen or methyl and n is an integer 

of 1 to 4.

durability of photochromic properties, and also possesses a

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a photochromic
composition having an excellent durable photochromic
action.Photochromism is a phenomenon, which has attracted
attention for the past several years, in which light
containing ultraviolet rays such as sunlight or light from
a mercury lamp is irradiated onto a compound, its colour
rapidly changes, and when the irradiation is stopped and
the compound is placed in a dark place, its colour
reversibly returns to the original colour. Compounds
having this property are called photochromic compounds.
Photochromic compounds having various structures have been
synthesized. However, these photochromic compounds have
the disadvantage of poor reversible durability.The present inventors have studied a series of
photochromic compounds, and succeeded in synthesizing novel
fulgide compounds and novel chromene compounds. They have
found that these compounds have excellent photochromic
action. For example, fulgide compounds are disclosed in
US-A-4,882,438, US-A-4,960,678 and US-A-5,130,058 and
chromene compounds are disclosed in US-A-5,106,998.These photochromic compounds have excellent
reversible durability, but when such a compound is mixed
with a radical-polymerizable monomer and the mixture is
polymerized, the resulting photochromic resin being used
for various utilities, a better reversible durability of
the photochromic action is sought.The present invention seeks to provide a
photochromic composition having a deep colour-forming
density and a fast colour fading speed, and a photochromic
resin having good photochromism, transparency and surface
hardness.We have continued to assiduously investigate the
production of a photochromic resin typified by a
photochromic lens by mixing a photochromic compound with a
radical-polymerizable monomer and polymerizing the mixture.
As a result, we have found that by using a particular
photochromic compound conjointly with a particular compound 
having at least one epoxy group in the molecule, the
durability of the photochromic action of the photochromic
compound is increased.The present invention provides a photochromic
composition comprising:
(A) 100 parts by weight of a compound having at
least one epoxy group per molecule of formula (1);(B) 0.0001 to 10,000 parts by weight of a
photochromic compound comprising a fulgide compound of
formula (2);(C) 1 to 99,999 parts by weight of a monomer of
formula (3); and(D) 1 to 99,999 parts by weight of a monomer of
formula (4);
   the total amount of (C) and (D) being from 10 to
100,000 parts by
