<ABSTRACT>
An improved grass surface in which the grass is grown in a layer 
of material comprising sand, an organic growth supporting medium 

and elongate synthetic fibres, the fibres being randomly 
dispersed as separate individual fibres in the growing material, 

and having an average fibre length from 5mm to 75mm and/or an 
improved sub-base for surfaces for sporting and/or other 

activities comprising the said material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to improved surfaces for 
sporting and other activities, and more particularly to 
surfaces suitable for equestrian usage, for ball games, such 
as football and golf, and other leisure activities. The natural surface for most equestrian events, 
particularly horse jumping, is grass. This is acceptable for 
large areas such as race courses where the usage is low and the 
grass therefore has time to recover between race meetings. 
Where the surface is used more extensively, for example, in 
training areas, grass, particularly in the autumn and winter 
period, becomes worn and muddy patches appear. These patches 
form dusty hard surfaces in dry conditions, and this may lead 
to an unacceptable incidence of leg injuries. As an alternative to grass a number of artificial surfaces 
have been used. A first known surface comprises natural wood 
fibre and this when new provides a good surface. It is however 
a natural material and therefore deteriorates with age. Thus 
it has to be replaced and since it is fairly expensive the 
replacement cost is high. A second known surface comprises 
finely chopped PVC often from used electrical cable insulation 
material. This produces a good surface but if laid deeply the 
surface is rather loose and the cost of the material is very 
high. A third known surface comprises ashes from power  
 
stations. The ashes provide a surface which drains readily 
when newly laid in wet weather but in dry conditions the 
surface produces dust and becomes compacted becoming hard 
especially after prolonged use. An alternative surface is 
silica sand which provides a good surface in wet weather 
conditions but in dry weather conditions the sand provides an 
extremely difficult surface for both jumping and landing 
particularly for an equestrian practise ring. The principal 
problem of silica sand is that it lacks cohesion therefore 
providing a surface which is described as riding too deep and 
loose. The natural surface for most ball games is also grass. 
The damage to the turf and soil structure which is caused by 
normal usage is intensive and the scale of damage can exceed 
the rate of such recovery. This is particularly pronounced in 
areas such as goal mouths and centre circles of football 
pitches and on golf tees where the turf can be totally 
destroyed and the soil severely compacted. In wet weather this 
means mud; in dry weather the surface is hard and bumpy. As an alternative to grass a number of artificial surfaces 
have been used. A first known

<CLAIMS>
1. An improved grass surface in which the grass is grown in 
a layer of material comprising sand, an organic growth 

supporting medium and elongate synthetic fibres, the 

fibres being randomly dispersed as separate individual 
fibres in the material, having a fibre length from 5mm to 

75mm. 
2. An all weather surface as claimed in claim 1, in which 
the sand is silica sand in which the sand particles have 

an average diameter in the range of from 100 to 1000 
microns and/or in which the organic growth supporting 

medium is soil, peat, or a mixture thereof, preferably 
comprising a soil conditioner, preferably a seaweed 

based soil conditioner. 
3. A surface according to Claim 1 or 2, in which the 
elongate synthetic fibres have a fibre length from 20 to 

40mm and/or average diameter from 50 to 150 denier. 
. A surface according to any of the preceding claims, in 
which the layer of material is from 50 to 150mm thick 

and/or in which the material (a) comprises from 50 to 
95% of silica sand by volume of the total material, or 

(b) comprises from 50 to 95% of sand bonded with water 
activated clay, by volume of the total material. 
5. A surface according to any of the preceding claims, in 
which the organic growth supporting medium comprises soil 

which is present in an amount of from 5 to 50% by volume 
based on the total volume of the growing material and/or 

 
comprises peat which is present in an amount of from 5 to 

25% by volume based on the total volume of the growing 
material. 
6. A surface according to any of the preceding claims, in 
which there is present a seaweed based soil conditioner 

in an amount of from 50 to 100g/mÂ², based upon the area of 
the growing material layer, and/or an inorganic 

fertiliser in an amount of from 10 to 50kg/20 tonnes of 
total growing material by weight. 
7. A surface according to any of the preceding claims, in 
which the percentage of synthetic fibres in the material 

is in the range of from 0.1 to 0.9% by weight based on 
the total weight of the material. 
8. A method of forming an all weather grass surface, which 
comprises sowing grass seed in, or applying turf to, a 

layer of growing material comprising sand, an organic 
growth supporting medium and elongate synthetic fibres, 

the fibres having a length from 5mm to 75mm and being 
randomly dispersed as separate individual fibres in the 

growing material, preferably by being pre-mixed with the 
sandin a high intensity mixer. 
9. A growing material for a grass surface, which material 
comprises sand, an organic growth supporting medium and 

elongate synthetic fibres, the fibres being randomly 
dispersed as separate individual fibres in the growing 

material, and having a fibre length from 5mm to 75mm. 
10. A sub-base for a surface for sporting and/or other 
activities which comprises a layer of material comprising 

a mixture of sand, a particulate or fibrous organic 
material comprising vegetable matter and elongate 

synthetic fibres, the fibres being randomly dispersed as 
separate individual fibres in the mixture and having a 

fibre length of from 5mm to 75mm.
