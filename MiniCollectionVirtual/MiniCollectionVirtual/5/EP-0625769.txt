<ABSTRACT>
The transmission circuit includes an oscillator (7) the output of which is coupled to a duty cycle control input (8) via a feedback loop including a mean-value determination circuit (9). The mean value of the output signals from the oscillator is slaved to the DC voltage (U1) to be transmitted. The output of the oscillator is connected to the input of an optoelectronic coupler (11) forming DC isolation between the input (U1) and the output (U2) of the transmission circuit. Another mean-value determination circuit (12) is connected to the output of the coupler (11). Calibration circuits (13, 14) are respectively connected upstream of the mean-value determination circuits.
