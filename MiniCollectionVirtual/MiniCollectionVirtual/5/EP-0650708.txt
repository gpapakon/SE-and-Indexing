<ABSTRACT>
A visco-elastic polymer liner (150) for use in donning over a residual limb 
(26) and fitting within the socket (146) of an artificial limb (140). The 

liner is shaped to have its cavity formed with a volume and shape less than 
a volume and shape of the residual limb for both tension and tissue 

configuration relief while the liner has an outer surface formed with a 
volume and shape greater than the volume and shape of the artificial limb 

socket for relief of certain tissue configurations and to create weight 
bearing, relief and compression areas on and in the liner to absorb and 

dissipate shock, shear and mechanical forces through the liner otherwise 
transmitted to the residual limb. The liner may have imbedded on its inner 

cavity side electrodes (152,154) adjacent muscles (38,40) that are sensitive 
to the muscle action potentials to generate signals to a power source to move 

an articulable artificial limb. The liner may take the shape of a tube to 
be donned over a paralyzed limb similarly having electrodes imbedded in its 

inner cavity side adjacent neuromuscular junctions which are connected to a 
muscle action potential generator to activate flexion and extension of the 

paralyzed limb. A method for making the liner is also claimed which comprises 
the making of a positive model of the residual limb, reducing the model, 

forming the liner about the reduced model and laminating a hard socket over 
a reduced model of the liner.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to prosthetic devices and more
particularly to an improved liner for prosthetic devices
including artificial limbs that also may be articulable or
bionic.An amputee is a person who has lost part of an extremity or
limb such a leg or arm which commonly may be termed as a residual
limb. Residual limbs come in various sizes and shapes with
respect to the stump. That is, most new amputations are either
slightly bulbous or cylindrical in shape while older amputations
that may have had a lot of atrophy are generally more conical in
shape. Residual limbs may further be characterized by their
various individual problems or configurations including the
volume and shape of a stump and possible scar, skin graft, bony
prominence, uneven limb volume, neuroma, pain, edema or soft
tissue configurations.Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, a below the knee residual
limb 10 is shown and described as a leg 12 having been severed
below the knee terminating in a stump 14. In this case, the
residual limb 10 includes soft tissue as well as the femur 16,
knee joint 18, and severed tibia 20 and fibula 22. Along these
bone structures surrounded by soft tissue are nerve bundles and
vascular routes which must be protected against external pressure
to avoid neuromas, numbness and discomfort as well as other kinds
of problems. A below the knee residual limb 10 has its stump 14
generally characterized as being a more bony structure while an
above the knee residual limb may be characterized as including
more soft tissue as well as the vascular routes and nerve
bundles.Referring to FIG. 3, amputees who have lost a part of their
arm 26, which terminates in a stump 28 also may be characterized 
as having vascular routes, nerve bundles as well as soft and bony
tissues. The residual limb 10 includes the humerus bone 30 which
extends from below the shoulder to the elbow from which the
radius 34 and ulna 36 bones may pivotally extend to the point of
severance. Along the humerus bone 30 are the biceps muscle 38
and the triceps muscle 40 which still yet may be connected to the
radius 34 and the ulna 36, respectively.In some respects, the residual limb amputee that has a
severed arm 26 does not have the pressure bearing considerations
for an artificial limb but rather is concerned with having an
artificial limb that is articulable to offer functions typical
of a full arm, such as bending at the elbow and grasping
capabilities. An individual who has a paralyzed limb would also
have similar considerations wherein he or she
