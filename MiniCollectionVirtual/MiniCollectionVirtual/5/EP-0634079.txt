<ABSTRACT>
A video storage arrangement produces a continuous video signal representing a test pattern. One luminance frame store is provided and two chrominance frame stores. A selection can be made between NTSC, PAL and SECAM modes. Switches are provided for selecting between chrominance frame stores and between inverting and non-inverting mode. Depending upon the selected broadcast standard, these switches are driven from field and line clock signals to generate the required output field sequence in YC or composite form.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the storage and processing of
video information for the purpose, in specific examples, of
generating a video store or a test pattern.It is a relatively straightforward matter to construct a
store capable of holding one frame of video in YUV or RGB
form. Two field stores will suffice. In order to produce a
continuous video signal representing, for example, a fixed
test pattern, the YUV or RGB output from the field stores will
be passed through an encoder operated in PAL, NTSC or SECAM,
for example. Encoders, particularly SECAM encoders, are
relatively expensive and it would thus be an advantage to have
a video store capable of holding luminance and chrominance
information already encoded in the desired standard. In
circumstances where multi-standard outputs are required, there
will be a still greater advantage in storing encoded rather
than RGB or YUV information, since the alternative would be to
provide essentially three separate encoders.It will be recognised that in standards such as PAL, NTSC
and SECAM, there is a repeating field sequence that extends
over more than one frame. This means that a single constant
frame of RGB or YUC cannot be represented as a single constant
frame of encoded signal. PAL for example has an eight field
sequence. An attempt to produce a test pattern in PAL using
only two stored fields would introduce chrominance structure
which, certainly in the professional environment, would be
entirely unacceptable. However, the requirement of eight field
storage for a single frame would make the video store
extremely expensive. The position is worse if the store is 
required to provide separate Y and C outputs since two further
fields of luminance storage would be required. A ten field
still frame video store would at present hardware costs
probably be regarded as prohibitively expensive.DE-A-4 018 812 describes a test image generator for multiple standards. It comprises
memories for storing component signals and a PAL encoder for producing a PAL
signal. Video data of other standards (NTSC, D2) can be supplied to a selection switch
through additional paths.It is an object of this invention to provide improved
video storage enabling the generation of a video still, test
pattern or other single image which is capable of holding
encoded luminance and chrominance signals.It is a further object of this invention to provide such
field storage with economical use of field stores.In a still further object of certain aspects of this
invention to provide for field
