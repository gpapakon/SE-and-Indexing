<ABSTRACT>
The aim of the invention is to design a shoe (1) with a central rotary fastener (3) in such a way that the fastener does not open unintentionally when the insole is subjected to stress. This is achieved by virtue of the fact that the fastener (3) is fitted to the outside (2) of the shoe and that the tensioning element (7) is made up of two sections (8, 9) running towards the heel and towards the toe, respectively. Each of the tensioning-element sections (8, 9) is connected to an elastic strap (12, 13), one strap extending forwards over the insole (17) to the inside (18) of the foot and the other extending rearwards round the heel (21) and forwards again on the inside (18) of the foot to pass over the insole (17) towards the outside (2) of the foot.

Footwear (1), especially footwear for sport or leisure, having a
central rotary closure (3) and at least one tightener element (7)

which is coupled to the latter and led over associated deflector elements
(14) on the footwear (1) to enable closing of the footwear (1)

upon tightening the tightener element (7), the central rotary closure (3)
being arranged on the outside (2) of the footwear in the neighbourhood of

the outer ankle-bone, characterized by the following features;

on the same side (2) of the footwear tightener sections (8, 9) of
the tightener element (7) are formed, one directed forwards and one

towards the rear from the central rotary closure (3);
the front tightener section (8) is coupled or connected to a tension-strap
(12) which runs forwards obliquely over the instep (17) and the

end of which is fastened to the upper (4) of the footwear, especially
at the inside (18) of the footwear;
the rear tightener section (9) is coupled or connected to a tension-strap
(13) which runs towards the rear round the heel (21) to the

inside (18) of the footwear and if necessary round a deflection (22)
obliquely forwards over the instep (17), if necessary crossing the

first tension-strap (12), and the end of which is fastened directly
or indirectly to the upper (4) of the footwear on the outside (2) of

the footwear.
Footwear as in Claim 1, characterized in that both or at least one
of the tightener sections (8, 9) is coupled or connected to the associated

draw-strap (12, 13) by a respective coupling-member (10, 11).
Footwear as in Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the coupling-members
(10, 11) exhibit deflector guides (14, 15) and that each

tightener-section (8, 9) forms a loop (8', 9') which is laid over the
deflector guides of the associated coupling member (10, 11).
Footwear as in one of the Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that
that length of draw-strap (13) coupled to the front tightener-section (8)

which runs from the point of attachment (19) provided in the region of
the instep to the coupling member (10), is looped round one deflector

member or respectively round one deflector-bridge (16) of the latter and
then led over the instep (17) to the inside (18) of the footwear and

there fastened. 
Footwear as in one of the Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that
the deflection (22) existing at the inside (18) of the footwear is

provided in the region in front of the inner ankle-bone.
Footwear as in Claim 5, characterized in that
the deflection (22) is made in the form of a pin or rod and arranged

horizontally or slightly inclined to the horizontal.
Footwear as in Claim 6, characterized in that
the deflection (22) is made after the style of an elongated link of

a chain, one longitudinal portion (23) of which is fastened to the
footwear (1) or to the sole (20) and round the other longtitudinal

portion (23) of which is led the tension strap (13).
Footwear as in one of the Claims 1 to 7, characterized in that
the central rotary closure (3) is fastened directly or indirectly

to the upper (4).
Footwear as in one of the Claims 1 to 7, characterized in that
the central rotary closure (3) is fastened to a bearer plate (5).
Footwear as in Claim 9, characterized in that
the bearer plate (5) is fastened in the region of its bottom edge (6)

to the footwear (1).
Footwear as in Claim 9 or 10, characterized in that
the bearer plate (5) exhibits guides (25) for the tightener

element (7).
Footwear as in Claim 11, characterized in that
the guides (25) are made at least partially as closed guides.
