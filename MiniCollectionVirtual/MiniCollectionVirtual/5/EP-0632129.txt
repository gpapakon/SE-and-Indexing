<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to the preparation of novel 
vector systems which are generated by in-vitro recombination, 

using gene technology, of nucleic acids from foamy 
virus species and of exogenous nucleic acid, and are 

produced by suitable host cells or by recombinantly 
altered packaging cell lines. The recombinant preparation 

of particularly suitable packaging cell lines is likewise 
a constituent of this invention. The invention is distinguished 

by the safe and efficient transfer by foamy virus 
vectors of therapeutic and other genes into eukaryotic 

cells.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to recombinant foamy virus vectors. The invention is
distinguished by the safe and efficient transfer by foamy virus vectors of therapeutic
and other genes into eukaryotic cells.The recombinant foamy virus vectors of the present invention are characterized by
the features as set forth in the claims. The term "foamy virus vector(s)" as used
herein refers to "foamy virus vector(s) of the present invention".The foamy virus vectors reach an extremely broad spectrum of eucaryotic cells: they
transduce a very wide variety of mammalian cells; they can be used, in particular, for
transferring genes into many different somatic cells in humans.The foamy virus vectors are distinguished by a large capacity for accepting
exogenous DNA fragments.The expression of exogenous DNA in the foamy virus vectors can be regulated
stringently, for example, by the viral transactivator bel-1, if no exogenous promoter
is used in the vector.The foamy virus vectors derived from foamy virus are non-pathogenic in humans and
are therefore safe to use. There 
is no evidence that human foamy virus causes pathological
effects in man. Former reports speculating that human
foamy virus is involved in neurological diseases, Graves'
disease, other autoimmune conditions, thyroiditis de
Quervain, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis can now
clearly be denied on the basis of intensive analyses for
foamy virus in such clinical samples. Safety of foamy
virus vectors for use also derives from the fact that
homologous DNA sequences, which can give rise to homologous
recombination of foamy virus vector and cellular
DNA, are not present in human chromosomal DNA. Foamy
viruses are phylogentically distinct from other retroviruses.Foamy virus, and the vectors derived from it, have no
known oncogenic potential.Replication-competent foamy virus vectors are prepared,
inter alia, by deleting the viral genes bel-2 and bel-3.For example, the foamy virus vectors pFOV-1, pFOV-2 and
pFOV-3 possess in common a deletion of about 420 base
pairs in the 3' direction adjoining the bel-1 gene.In addition, replication-incompetent foamy virus vectors,
such as, for example, pFOV-4, were prepared which can be
produced in packaging cell lines which are likewise
prepared by gene technology.Foamy virus vectors are suitable for expressing exogenous 
DNA in human or animal target cells in order to form
therapeutically active proteins or antisense RNA or decoy
RNA. Foamy virus vectors are suitable for expressing
exogenous DNA in humans or animals in order
