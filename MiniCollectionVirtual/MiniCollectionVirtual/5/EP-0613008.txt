<ABSTRACT>
It has been known that the undersurface of 
evaporation caps in an incubator of an analyzer can 

become spotted with sample from test elements 
positioned under the caps. This has been found to be 

due to electrostatic attraction building up on the 
caps, due to the use of plastic parts. Described 

herein is an incubator (50) comprising a housing (52) 
having a plurality of stations (62) formed therein for 

receiving test elements, the housing (52) including 
connecting members (66) mounted on a drive spindle 

(70). At least the connecting members (66) are made 
from a plastic material which has enough carbon fibers 

to provide a volume resistivity throughout the plastic 
material of between 10⁵ and 10⁹ Ωcm so that the 

housing (52) can be grounded through the spindle (70) 
on which it is mounted.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to improvements 
relating to incubators for analyzers, and is more 
particularly concerned with incubators which use 
plastic parts, such as for the rotor. It has been common for incubators, such as 
are used in the "Ektachem"™ brand of clinical 
analyzers manufactured by Eastman Kodak Company since 
1982, to use plastic evaporation caps which cover 
plastic slides after the latter are slid into place 
under the caps, for incubation. During the use of 
thousands of such incubators, over the years, there has 
never been a problem, until recently, of the sample 
liquid which is pre-deposited on to the slides, 
spotting also the under-surface of the evaporation cap 
positioned above it. However, recent modifications in the design 
have recently caused, in some instances, such spotting 
to occur. Some of those modifications include coating 
the incubator rotor disk with "Marten Hardcoat", a 
ceramic/"Teflon"™ based material, to reduce wear and 
carry-over of ammonia from ammonia-producing slides, 
and converting portions of the housing of the incubator 
from metal to glass-filled plastic, for savings in cost 
and weight. The latter change has featured plastic 
connecting members which mount the rotating incubator 
to a drive spindle. The spotting is highly 
objectionable because of the color shift in the white 
reflectance of the evaporation cap, a problem 
particularly when using translucent slide elements. The obvious cause of the problem was thought 
to be one of inertia. The caps must be snapping down 
too hard on to the captured slide so as to cause 
residual liquid not yet absorbed by the slide, to "jump 
up". The solutions which were tried for this problem 
were: a) to prevent such snapping action by the cap,  
 
and/or b) to double the height of the cap under-surface 
above the slide to prevent the inertially-displaced 
liquid from reaching it. However, none of these 
solutions was found to be effective. In fact, it was 
surprisingly discovered that inertia is not the cause 
of the problem at all. Hence, prior to the present invention, there 
has been an unsolved problem of sample liquid deposited 
on plastic, liquid-absorbing slide test elements, also 
becoming deposited in small amounts on the under-surface 
of the evaporation cap disposed above the slide 
element when the latter is in an incubator. It has been discovered that the real, and 
surprising, cause of the problem is electrostatic 
charge build-up in the evaporation caps, causing liquid 
to "jump" off the
