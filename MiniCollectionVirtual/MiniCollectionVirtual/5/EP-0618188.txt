<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to an improved hydrogenation and 
isomerization process wherein aromatic amines are hydrogenated to their 

ring hydrogenated counterparts and substantially isomerized to their 
thermodynamic form. These aromatic amines are presented by the 

formulas: 

wherein R is hydrogen or C₁₋₆ alkyl, R1 and R2 are hydrogen or 
C₁₋₆ 

aliphatic, A is C₁₋₄ or NH; n is 0-2, x is 1-3 and y is 0 to 2 
except 

the sum of the y groups must be at least 1. 
The hydrogenation process is characterised by the use of a catalyst 
comprising a mixture of cobalt and a metal selected from the group 

consisting of rhodium, ruthenium, palladium and platinum, whereas the 
isomerisation uses a catalyst comprises cobalt in its reduced state.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to a process for hydrogenating aromatic 
amines to produce their ring hydrogenated counterparts. There is substantial literature in the art with respect to the 
hydrogenation of aromatic amines, including bridged aromatic amines, 
e.g., methylenedianiline to produce 4,4'-methylenedi(cyclohexylamine), 
also referred to as bis(para-aminocyclohexyl)methane (PACM), and 
bis(4-aminocyclohexyl)methane. The hydrogenated form of these aromatic 
amines, typically exist as a mixture of isomers, e.g., the cis,cis- (c,c); 
cis,trans- (c,t) and trans,trans- (t,t). Often it is desirable 
to produce a product having a specific isomer content, as the isomer 
content in the mixture not only influences the physical form of the 
product but also influences the properties of products in which they are 
incorporated. In the case of PACM, a low trans,trans- isomer content 
(20%) in the mixture, commonly referred to as PACM-20, exists as a 
liquid product while a mixture high in trans,trans- isomer content 
(50%), commonly referred to as PACM-48, leads to a solid form. For 
certain applications, such as the manufacture of polyamide fibers and 
epoxy additives, it often is beneficial to use PACM-48 instead of 
PACM-20. Commercially, PACM-48 is produced through continuous processing 
conditions, where catalyst loading and reactor residence times are sufficient 
to yield the product of thermodynamic control. Batch processing 
conditions produce PACM-48 from MDA inefficiently due to excessive 
reaction times required for complete isomerization to the product of 
thermodynamic control. Some of the early hydrogenation work to produce cycloaliphatic 
amines, such as, PACM, was done by Whitman and Barkdoll, et al. and 
their work is set forth in a series of U.S. Patents, e.g., 2,511,028; 
2,606,924; 2,606,925; and 2,606,928. Basically the processes described 
in these patents involve the hydrogenation of methylenedianiline at 
pressures in excess of 200 psig, preferably in excess of 1,000 psig, at 
temperatures within a range of 80 to 275°C utilizing a ruthenium  
 
catalyst. The hydrogenation is carried out under liquid phase 
conditions and an inert organic solvent is used in the hydrogenation 
process. Typically, a liquid product having a trans,trans- isomer 
content of 15-23% is obtained. Examples of ruthenium catalysts utilized 
for the hydrogenation process include ruthenium oxides such as ruthenium 
sesquioxide and ruthenium dioxide; and ruthenium salts. Brake, et al. in U.S. 3,696,108 and 3,644,522
