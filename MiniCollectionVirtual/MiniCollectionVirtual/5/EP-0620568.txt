<ABSTRACT>
A rotary electronic device of a neutral position 
return type can control output in a stepless mode. A 

rotary variable resistor of the rotary electronic device 
is installed to a tubular holder (21), and a torsion coil 

spring (36) is disposed between a manipulation knob (30) and the 
tubular holder (21). Thereby a function of neutral position 

return can be very simply configured by using the small 
sized rotary variable resistor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a rotary 
electronic device which is suitable, for instance for use 
in a zooming speed controlling unit of a video camera. Since a zooming speed controlling unit of a 
video camera is provided for zooming out on the "TELE 
(telescopic)" side and zooming in on "WIDE (wide range)" 
side, and required to instantaneously stop the movement of 
a lens unit of the video camera at a predetermined 
position, a seesaw manipulation-type switch of a neutral 
position return-motion is widely used in an operation unit 
for the zooming speed controlling unit. A conventional seesaw manipulation-type switch 
disclosed in the Japanese unexamined Utility Model 
Publication No. (Jikkai Sho) 57-173229 will be explained 
with reference to drawings of FIG.15 to FIG.18. FIG.15 is an exploded perspective view showing 
the seesaw manipulation-type switch of the conventional 
seesaw manipulation-type electronic device. FIG.16 is a 
front view showing a base plate of the conventional seesaw 
manipulation-type electronic device. FIG.17 is a front 
view of the base plate of FIG.16. FIG.18 is a front view  
 
explaining an operation of a return mechanism of the 
conventional seesaw manipulation-type electronic device. In these drawings, a manipulation key 3 of the 
seesaw manipulation-type switch is swayably provided to a 
support shaft 2 in an upper portion of a housing 1. As 
shown in FIG.15, under the manipulation key 3, a brush 
receiving plate 3a is extendedly provided to be arranged 
perpendicularly to the support shaft 2, and an 
electrically-conductive brush 4 is fixed to the brush-receiving 
plate 3a in a cantilever-fashion. As shown in 
FIG.16, the base plate 6 has a plurality of sector-shaped 
fixed contacts 5a, 5b, 5c, 5d, 5e, 5f, 5g, 5h, 5i and 5j 
formed to have a concentric pattern. The base plate 6 is 
disposed to face one face of the brush-receiving plate 3a 
in the housing 1, and the brush 4 is arranged to 
elastically contact a surface of the sector-shaped fixed 
contacts 5a --- 5j on the base plate 6. On the other face 
of the brush-receiving plate 3a, a pair of spring 
receiving members 7, 8 is rotatably attached by the 
support shaft 2. And, a coil spring 9 is compressively 
provided between both the spring receiving members 7 and 
8. As shown in FIG.15, a stopping protrusion 1a 
protruding from a side wall of the housing 1 and an 
engaging pin 3b protruding from the brush-receiving plate 
3a are inserted and interposed between both the spring 
receiving members 7 and 8 as shown
