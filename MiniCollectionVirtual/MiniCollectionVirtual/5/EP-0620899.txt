<ABSTRACT>
A framing system (10) is disclosed including three-dimensional structural members (12, 14) formed from planar panels (16) having their edges removably secured together by provisions (48) including a slide connector (66) which receives lugs (52) slideably received in and abutting with latches (56). The panels (16) include interconnect ports (22) having integral, concentric tubes (24). The exterior faces (18) of the structural members (12, 14) are abutted together, with the structural members (12, 14) being clamped by a clamping band (28) having a central wall (30) abutting with the tubes (24) and first and second side walls (32, 34) abutting with the free faces (25) of the tubes (24). In the preferred form, the clamping band (28) is split and is removably locatable in the ports (22) by being distortable into a helical shape by flex notches (40, 42) formed in the side walls (32, 34). Relative rotation is prevented between the clamping band (28) and the structural members (12, 14) by detents (44) formed in the clamping band (28) which are received in notches (26) formed in the free face (25) of the tubes (24).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to modular
structural framing systems, and particularly to attachment
panels, unitary clamping bands, and interconnect apparatus
therefor.The craft of building structures is well known.
Typical wood framing utilizing 2 inch by 4 inch (5 cm by
10 cm) studs has been used for construction for many years,
with metal studs being used more recently. Further, steel,
aluminum, wood, plastic, and other materials have been
used for fabricating tubing, channel, "T" or "I" beams,
and like structural members. Typically, studs and other 
structural members are joined together with nails, barbed
plates, bolts, rivets, and the like. Other structures
utilized columns and beams connected by other methods of
fastening including rope lashing, special notch cutting,
mitering and nesting techniques, and the like to obtain
strong and simple connections to build a variety of
structures. As time progressed, building materials such
as stone, wood, steel, and more recently composites have
become standardized in size, weight, and strength. The
introduction of truss or space frames allowed building
materials to have reduced structural mass and increased
span resulting in higher strength to weight ratios.
However, most construction practice used in fastening
building structural components of a structure together
still rely upon common devices such as nails, rivets,
bolts, and like fasteners. Also, building materials are
generally of a solid mass or unitized truss member
requiring the maximum space for storage or transport.
Further, quick connect/disconnect fastening mechanisms for
structural members so that they can be rapidly assembled
and disassembled without compromising structural strength
are known such as shown in U.S. Patent No. 4,776,721.
However, such fastening mechanisms utilized clamping
mechanisms extending around the periphery of portions of
the structural members thus restricting the configuration
thereof and/or location of the attachment of one
structural member to another, i.e. an in-line end tube
connection will not attach to the side wall of another
tube, etc., and often would not allow communication
through the fastening mechanism. Also, prior quick
connect/disconnect fastening mechanisms may only join
together respective male/female structural members by a
change in orientation and by radial translation and/or
displacement of one or more members to interfit the
male/female interface.Thus, a need exists for modular structural framing
systems including components which
