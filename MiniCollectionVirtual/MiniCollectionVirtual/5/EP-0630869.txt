<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of reducing the allergy-inducing (allergenic) activity of water-soluble Cr
<
VI
>
 in cements and/or cement-containing preparations, which comprises selecting in preliminary experiments a lignosulphonate from the multiplicity of lignosulphonates available on the market which reduces, in the desired manner, the water-soluble Cr
<
VI
>
 content on exposure of a cement and/or a cement-containing preparation to water, and adding this selected lignosulphonate to cements and/or cement-containing preparations prior to or during the addition of water in the production of fresh cement mixtures.

<CLAIMS>
A method for decreasing water-soluble Cr
VI
 in cements and/or 
cement-containing preparations,
 
characterised in that,
 
in preliminary tests a lignosulphonate is identified from 

a multiplicity of lignosulphonates available on the market, 
which on addition of water to a cement and/or to a cement-containing 

preparation, lowers the water-soluble Cr
VI
 content 
below the limit of 0.1 x 10
-3
 M% of water-soluble CR
VI
, 
and this selected lignosulphonate is added to cements 

and/or cement-containing preparations before or during the 
addition of water to produce fresh cement mixtures. 
A method according to Claim 1,
 
characterised in that,
 
a ferrous lignosulphonate is used. 
A method according to Claim 2,
 
characterised in that,
 
the ferrous lignosulphonate is added in quantities of 200 

to 400 mg/mg Cr
VI
. 
A method according to Claim 1,
 
characterised in that,
 
a calcium lignosulphonate is used. 
A method according to Claim 4,
 
characterised in that,
 
the calcium lognosulphonate is added in quatities of 200 to 

500 mg/mg Cr
VI
.  
 
A method according to one or more of Claims 1 to 5,
 
characterised in that,
 
finely-divided water-binding additives are additionally 

added to compensate for the liquefying effect of the 
lignosulphonates. 
A method according to Claim 6,
 
characterised in that,
 
1 to 10 M% of finely-divided silicic acid (microsilica) in 

relation to the cement content is added. 
A method according to Claim 6 and/or claim 7,
 
characterised in that,
 
1 to 20 M% of finely-divided calcium carbonate in relation 

to the cement content is added. 
A method according to one or more of Claims 1 to 8,
 
characterised in that,
 
a setting accelerator known per se is added. 
A method according to Claim 9,
 
characterised in that,
 
calcium formate is added as setting accelerator. 
A method according to one or more of Claims 1 to 10,
 
characterised in that,
 
the lignosulphonate is added before or during the grinding 

of the cement clinker.
