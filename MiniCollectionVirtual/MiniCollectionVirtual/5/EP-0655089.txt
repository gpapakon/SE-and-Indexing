<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to therapeutic methods wherein an actin-binding protein, preferably gelsolin or DBP, is administered to a patient with actin-containing clots in order to remove actin from the clots. The invention also relates to diagnostic methods in which actin is removed from an actin-containing clot (in vitro) and quantitated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention generally relates to therapeutic and diagnostic methods
for treating patients with tissue injury in which free extracellular actin is
associated with blood clots. The present invention relaxes to a method to assay
the amount of main present in a fibrin clot. The method involves the in vitro
quantitation of the amount of actin in the clot by incubation of the clot in vitro
with proteins that bind actin. The invention is specifically related to
incubation of such clots in the presence of the plasma actin binding proteins
gelsolin and vitamin D-binding protein. The invention is also directed to
methods of removing actin from blood clots in vivo by administering actin-binding
proteins to subjects with blood clots.Tissue injury results in the activation of the coagulation cascade,
leading to deposition of fibrin. During inflammatory events, molecules not
normally found in plasma may enter the extracellular space, potentially
affecting blood coagulation. Some of these molecules may arise from the
action of cellular proteases upon normal plasma constituents (e.g., fibrinogen),
the release of granules of inflammatory cells, or disruption of cellular plasma
membranes. Extensive studies of the effects of fibrinogen degradation
products upon fibrin clot formation (Shen et al., J. Biol. Chem. 252:6184
(1977) have provided important information about the mechanisms whereby
inflammatory events lead to alterations in the process of blood coagulation. 
Molecules that alter the fibrin gel formation and clot structure (Dhall et al.,
Thromb. Haemost. 35:737 (1976); Carr and Gabriel, J. Lab. Clin. Med.
96:985 (1980); Gabriel et al., J. Lab. Clin. Med. 101:545 (1983); Chow
et al., Thromb. Res. 29:243 (1983); Carr et al., J. Lab. Clin. Med. 110:747
(1987); Kamykowski et al., Biophys. Chem. 13:25 (1981); Procyk and King,
Biopolymers 29:559 (1990)) may play a role in determining the hemostatic
effectiveness of fibrin clots, as well as their ability to mediate fibrin-dependent
fibrinolysis (Suenson and Petersen, Biochim. Biophys. Acta 870:510(1986);
Dhall et al., Thrombos Haemostas 49:42 (1983)).Injury to animal tissues results in the release of actin into the
extracellular space, including the bloodstream. Actin is the most abundant
protein in animal cells and constitutes 10-20% of the protein of many
nucleated cells and 30% of the protein of muscle cells. Actin molecules each
bind an ATP molecule and self-assemble into long filaments during which the
ATP is hydrolyzed into ADP. Although approximately half of
