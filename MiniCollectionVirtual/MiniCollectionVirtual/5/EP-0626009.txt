Carboxymethylcellulases 5430 and 5812 which show strong activity toward carboxymethylcellulose and lichenan, and moreover are broad in active pH range and active temperature range, stable in the presence of various surfactants and excellent in thermal stability and particularly, in alkali resistance. These enzymes can be advantageously used as formulation components for detergent compositions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to new carboxymethyl-cellulases,
and more specifically to new enzymes,
carboxymethylcellulases, which are broad in active pH range
and active temperature range and particularly, far excellent
in pH stability and thermal stability, and microorganisms
producing such enzymes.Cellulases consist of a complex enzyme system which
catalyzes an enzymatic reaction, in which celluloses and
analogous polysaccharides thereof are hydrolyzed to glucose,
or cellobiose or cello-oligosaccharides, and are understood
to be a general term for enzymes referred to as C1 enzymes,
Cx enzymes, β-glucosidases, exo-β-glucanases, endo-β-glucanases,
cellobiases or the like according to their
action mechanisms. Viewed from a historic light, the
research of the cellulases has been devotedly advanced for a
long time with a view toward putting biomass resources to
good use. Fungi, for example, the genera Trichoderma,
Aspergillus, Acremonium and Humicola have been required for
sources of their supply. However, cellulases from
microorganisms including fungi have specificity on action of
their constitutive enzyme groups and diversity on their 
physicochemical properties and the like. Therefore, their
actual conditions can be yet hardly said to have been made
clear.Among the cellulases, those particularly high in
action on carboxymethylcellulose, i.e., endo-type hydrolytic
action, are called carboxymethylcellulases. In recent
years, an application to, for example, an additive for
laundry detergents has been developed as a new industrial
use for the cellulases including carboxymethyl-cellulases.
Judging from the above-described cellulases from
microorganisms, however, most of cellulases produced from
microorganisms in natural world show optimum activities at
acidic pHs and are deactivated at alkaline pHs. Namely,
they are acidic cellulases (optimum active pH: 4-6). Under
the circumstances, there has been found only few alkaline
cellulases and alkali-resistant cellulases, suitable for use
in laundry detergent which gives alkaline pHs.The term "alkaline cellulase" used herein is intended
to mean one whose optimum pH is in an alkaline range, and
the term "alkali-resistant cellulase" means one whose
optimum pH is in a neutral to acidic range, but which has a
satisfactory activity in an alkaline region as compared with
an activity at an optimum pH and is maintained stable.Namely, there have heretofore been reported only, as
processes for the production of alkaline cellulases and
alkali-resistant cellulases, which can

<CLAIMS>
Carboxymethylcellulase having the following physicochemical
properties:


(1) Action:

The enzyme can hydrolyze carboxymethylcellulose.
(2) Substrate specificity:

The enzyme shows strong activity toward
carboxymethylcellulose and lichenan, and also is active

toward cellulose powder, phosphoric acid-swollen cellulose,
cellobiose, p-nitrophenol-β-D-glucopyranoside and p-nitrophenyl-β-D-cellobioside.
(3) Active pH range and optimum pH:

The enzyme is active in a pH range of 4.2-12.5 and has
two optimum pH values of about 7.7 and about 9.5.
(4) pH Stability:

Even when kept overnight at 5°C, the enzyme is
scarcely deactivated over a pH range of 4.6-12.8.
(5) Active temperature range and optimum temperature:

The enzyme is active over a temperature range of 10-78°C,

and its optimum temperature is at about 55°C.
(6) Thermal stability:

The enzyme is scarcely deactivated even after heated
for 10 minutes at 60°C, and still retains some activity even

after heated to 80°C.
(7) Effects of surfactants: 

The activity of the enzyme is not inhibited by sodium
dodecyl sulfate (SDS), sodium linear alkylbenzenesulfonate

(LAS), sodium alkyl sulfate (AS), sodium polyoxyethylene
alkyl sulfate (ES), sodium α-olefin sulfonate (AOS), sodium

α-sulfonated fatty acid ester (a-SFE), fatty acid salt
(soap) and polyoxyethylene alkyl ether.
(8) Molecular weight:

The molecular weight of the enzyme is 26,000 ± 1,000
as estimated by gel filtration on Bio-Gel A 0.5 m.
