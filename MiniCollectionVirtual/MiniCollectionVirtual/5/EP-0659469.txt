<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a membrane for 
liquid mixture separation to be used in the pervaporation 
or vapor permeation method. Over the past years, a great deal of research has been 
devoted to separating liquid mixture using the pervaporation 
or vapor permeation technique through non-porous polymeric 
membranes. This separation process can be applied 
successfully to mixtures that are difficult to separate by 
more conventional techniques, such as is the case 
for azeotropic mixtures or mixtures of liquids with very small 
differences in vapor pressures. For example, studied 
the separation of an azeotropic mixture through polyvinyl 
alcohol membrane.( U.S. Patent No. 2953502) Recently, 
the separation of water-formaldehyde mixture thorugh styrene-acrylic 
acid copolymer membrane has been reported. (U.S. 
Patent No.4035291). These membranes, however, have not 
been put to practical use because of not enough the permeation 
rates or insufficient separating factors. Under these circumstances, the pervaporation and 
vapor permeation are one of the more recently recognized  
 
separation processes. They are regarded as a promising 
separation process which will supplement or supersede the 
distillation. It is considered that they are especially 
suitable for the separation of water-ethanol azeotrope. 
Therefore, active research and development works have 
been performed on these methods and some practical membranes 
for them have been proposed. For example, a cellulos 
membrane and a polyvinyl alcohol membrane are disclosed 
in Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 109204/1984 and a cross-linked 
polyethyleneimine membrane is disclosed in Japanese 
Patent Laid-open No. 55305/1984. However, these membranes 
disclosed so far are not of practical use because of 
insufficient separating factors or not enough permeating rates 
to similar physical propaties, as in the case of water 
and methanol. In addition, they show insufficient resistance 
to organic solvents such as DMF and (N,N-dimethylformamide). 
These shortcomings restrict their use to the separation 
of water from limited substances, such as alcohols and ketones 
having three or more carbon atoms. It is an aim of the present invention to provide a 
membrane with sufficient permeation rates and separating 
factors for liquid mixture separation to be used in the 
pervaporation or vapor permeation. They are free from the 
above-mentioned shortcomings of conventional membranes  
 
and capable of separating liquid mixture very efficiently 
with stable
