<ABSTRACT>
A method of checking a machining program for a numerical 
controller of an NC lathe having a plurality of tools mounted 

on the turret, by which interferences between tools and the work, 
and between the tools and each part of the lathe can be detected 

before the machining. In the stage of writing a machining program 
or of its simulation, all the tools n which are defined to be 

mounted on the turret A are detected (S1 to S4, and S6 to S8); the 
positional relationship between the tool m to be used and the 

other tools n is found (S5 and S9); the current positions of the 
tools n are found (S10) in accordance with the positional relationship 

and the machining program defined for the tool m to be 
used; and whether or not each of the tools n interferes with the 

work B or the area of the chuck C is judged in order to provide an 
alarm display (S11 to S14). Hence any interference of tools can be 

checked before the machining.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a machining 
program checking method for a numerical control device, 
and more particularly, to an improved machining program 
checking method for a numerical control device used with 
an NC turret lathe having a plurality of tools mounted 
thereon. There is known a machining program checking method 
for a numerical control device, wherein movement of a 
tool and cutting of a workpiece are simulated or 
interference between the tool and the workpiece is 
checked, on the bases of a machining program and data 
relating to the mounting of the tool specified in the 
machining program as a tool to be used. In the conventional machining program checking 
method, however, only the tool currently in use is 
checked for interference. Thus, in the case of a 
machine tool such as a turret lathe which performs a 
machining operation with a plurality of tools 
simultaneously mounted thereon, it is probable that, 
even when the tool currently in use is not interfering 
with the workpiece, other tools mounted on the turret 
may interfere with the workpiece or parts of the lathe. Conventionally, whether such interference occurs 
or not is determined through the operator's thought 
experiment at the time of preparation of a program or 
simulation of tool paths, but the operator's 
determination cannot always be perfect. If combination,  
 
disposition or the like of the tools mounted is 
improper, interference of tools may occur, causing 
damage to tool noses or to the workpiece, displacement 
of the spindle, etc. The present invention provides a machining program 
checking method for a numerical control device which 
controls an NC turret lathe for performing a machining 
operation with a plurality of tools simultaneously 
mounted thereon, wherein interference of the tools with 
a workpiece or with various parts of the lathe can be 
surely detected before the machining operation is 
actually executed. The machining program checking method according to 
the present invention comprises a step of obtaining a 
relationship of relative position between a tool which 
is specified as a tool to be used currently by a 
machining program and each of other tools mounted on the 
turret, a step of simulating movement of each of the 
other tools in accordance with the relationship of 
relative position between the currently used tool and 
each of the other tools, the machining program, and 
mounting data of each of the other tools, and a step of 
detecting interference of each of the tools mounted on

<CLAIMS>
A machining program checking method for a 
numerical control device which controls an NC lathe 

having a turret for carrying a plurality of tools 
thereon, comprising the steps of: 


(a) obtaining a relationship of relative position 
between a tool specified to be a tool in use by a 

machining program and each of other tools mounted on the 
turret; 
(b) simulating movement of each of said tools in 
accordance with the relationship of relative position 

obtained in said step (a), the machining program, and 
mounting data of each of said tools; and 
(c) detecting interference of each of said other 
tools mounted on the turret with a workpiece, and 

interference of each of said other tools with various 
parts of the NC lathe. 
The machining program checking method 
according to claim 1, wherein said step (a) comprises a 

step of obtaining a vector directed from a distal end of 
said tool in use to a distal end of each of said other 

tools, in accordance with offset data of said tool in 
use with respect to the turret, offset data of each of 

said other tools with respect to the turret, and an 
offset angle of each of said other tools with respect to 

said tool in use; and said step (c) comprises a step of 
determining whether or not the distal end of each of 

said other tools interferes with a region of the 
workpiece based on said vector. 
The machining program checking method 
according to claim 1, wherein said step (c) comprises a 

step of determining whether or not each of said other 
 

tools interferes with the various parts of the NC lathe, 
based on a distance between a center of the turret and 

an axis of the workpiece, a radius of a chuck holding 
the workpiece, and an offset angle of each of said other 

tools with respect to said tool in use.
