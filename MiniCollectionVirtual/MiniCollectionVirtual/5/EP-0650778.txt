which includes the steps of preforming and slitting the strip by 

intermeshing 
tooth segments of at least an upper disk and a lower disk (18,20) with 

the strip passing 
therebetween, wherein the tooth segments each include linear 

leading and 
trailing surfaces joined at an apex defining a nose angle (C), and 

intersecting 
respective tangents to a radius of the disk at circumferentially 

spaced locations 
defining entry (A) and exit (B) angles, respectively, an improvement 

which includes 
selecting the exit angle (B) in accordance with the formula:

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to improvement to conventional rotary expanded
battery grid processes and, specifically, to a cutter tool configuration which
produces a sufficiently thin mesh to allow pasting to a required weight.Electrodes of battery cells often comprise an expanded metal sheet, the
openings and surfaces of which carry a chemically active powder. A method
and apparatus for producing an expanded grid is disclosed in U.S. Patent No.
3,760,470. U.S. Patent No. 4,291,443 discloses a conventional three roll
cluster (where the strip passes between first and second rolls in a
preforming/slitting stage, and then between the second and a third roll in a
final slitting stage) for preforming and slitting a sheet to produce an expanded
metal mesh, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference. U.S.
Patent No. 4,297,866 discloses an improved process for producing expanded
metal sheet by concurrently slitting and preforming the strip. In a preferred
arrangement in the '866 patent, the length of one side of a triangle
corresponding to the tooth configuration, and collinear with the leading tooth
surface, is less than the length of another side of the triangle corresponding to
and collinear with the trailing tooth surface. In this same triangle, the entry
angle formed between the side of the triangle corresponding to the leading
surface and the base of the triangle is less than 90°. In other words, the
convexly shaped tooth surfaces used to deform slit segments out of the plane
of the sheet or strip are asymmetrically shaped. Problems have been
experienced with asymmetrical cutters, however. For example, when mesh is
required to be flattened to within 0.38-0.30 mm (.015-.012") of the strip thickness, and the top 
wires are very heavy (1.27-1.52 mm) (.050-.060") as required for positive grids with high
conductivity, the "short" leg of the tooth segment or surface develops a kink
when flattened. This kink prevents the mesh from being uniformly thin and
often causes jams, resulting in stoppages in the paster apparatus. Precision
pasting to the required weight thus becomes problematic.I have now discovered that forming the cutter tooth with a symmetrical
shape makes the mesh easier to flatten. One of the problems, however, with
choosing the correct angle for the cutter "triangle" relates to the permissible
elongation of the lead strip. Experience has shown that 45° is the maximum
entry angle. When this is translated into a rotary process, allowance must be
made for the fact that the tool rotates and

A method of forming expanded metal mesh from a deformable
strip (10) comprising initial preforming and slitting of the

strip, final slitting of the strip, and then expansion of
the strip, wherein the initial preforming and slitting is

accomplished by intermeshing tooth segments (132, 232) of at
least an upper disk (118, 218) and a lower disk (120, 220)
