<ABSTRACT>
The sensitivity of the sensor is improved by reducing the viscous resistance force of a gas exerted on a 
vibratory element, and reducing noises. The sensor comprises a first vibratory element (14) which is supported 

by a first supporting beam (15) vibratably in the direction (X-X) parallel to an upper base (12) and orthogonal to 
the supporting axis (O-O), and a second vibratory element (16) supported on the supporting axis (O-O) in the first 

vibratory element (14) by a second supporting beam (17), vibratingly in the direction (X-X) and in the direction (Z-Z) 
perpendicular to the upper supporting base (12). The vibratory elements (14 and 16) are vibratable in the direction 

(X-X) by the vibration generating parts (18). In this way, when a force (T) causing the second vibratory element (16) 
to rotate around the supporting axis (O-O), the second vibratory element (16) is displaced in the vertical direction 

(Z-Z) by the Corioli's force. The magnitude of this displacement is measured by the displacement detecting part (19) 
as a signal for measuring the angular velocity.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an angular velocity
sensor which is suitable for use, for example, in
detecting turning directions or postures of a motor
vehicle or of an aircraft or the like.Recently, as for angular velocity sensors of
relatively small sizes, many efforts have been directed to
the development of vibration type angular velocity
sensors. The angular velocity sensors of this type are
generally arranged to detect the angular veclocity
electronically from a displacement of a vibratory member
under the influence of Corioli's force which is known to
be proportional to the angular velocity, through the use
of piezoelectric elements located in association with the
vibratory member.The angular velocity sensors of this nature
usually involve a fabrication process of extremely high
precision, which is very expensive, for example, a
fabrication process utilizing semiconductor fabrication
technics (as proposed in Japanese Patent Laid-open 
No.Sho61-114123 and Sho61-139719).In this connection, Fig. 12 illustrates a prior
art angular velocity sensor as disclosed in the
above-mentioned Japanese Patent Laid-open No.Sho61-139719.In Fig. 12, indicated at 1 is a silicon substrate
structure largely constituted by a lower substrate 1A
which is shown on the lower side in that figure, an upper
substrate 1B which is located over the lower substrate 1A,
and a space 1C which is formed between the two substrates
1A and 1B to permit vibration of a cantilever type support
beam 2 as will be described hereinlater.Denoted at 2 is a thin-walled cantilever support
beam which is formed integrally in the upper substrate 1B
of the substrate structure 1 by etching technology or the
like. The cantilever support beam 2 is fixed at one end,
that is, at its base end 2A which is fixedly connected to
the upper substrate 1B, and disposed freely at the other
end 2B for vibration in upward and downward directions
perpendicularly to the face of the substrate 1. Further,
a rectangular slot 3 is formed longitudinally and
centrally of the cantilever support beam 2 in a base end
portion 2A thereof.The reference 4 denotes an electrode which is
formed on the top surface of a fore free end portion 2B of
the cantilever support beam 2. The electrode 4 is 
connected through a lead wire to an oscillator circuit
which generates a predetermined frequency signal (both of
the lead wire and the oscillator circuit not shown). Upon
applying the predetermined frequency signal to the
cantilever support beam 2 through the electrode 4, the
cantilever support
