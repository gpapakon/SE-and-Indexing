<DESCRIPTION>
 ITProduction and use of imines of porphyrinsFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to the production and use of imines of porphyrins, of porphyrins, and of related compounds, including metal complexes, e.g., bcnzochlorinimincs and benzochlorinimine metal complexes, which arc useful in photodynamic therapy. The invention also relates to compositions containing such imines. Specific examples of the bcnzochlorinimincs and of the benzochlorinimine metal complexes of the invention have the following structures:Formula I Formula IIwhere M comprises a metal cation that is complexed with two of the nitrogens of the bcnzochlorin and is Ag, Al, Cc, Co, Cr, Cu, Dy, Er, Eu, Fc, Ga, Gd, Hf, Ho, In, La, Lu, Mn, Mo, Nd, Ni, Pb, Pd, Pr, Pt, Rh, Sb, Sc, S , Sn, Tb, Tc, Th, Ti, Tl, Tm, U, V, Y, Yb, Zii or Zr, and A is a physiologically acceptable anion, e.g., chloride.The benzochlorins, bcnzochlorin metal complexes, and the other imines and iminc metal complexes according to the instant invention arc photo scnsitizcrs; i.e., excitation at a suitable wavelength promotes them to the singlet state, from which they decay to the ground state primarily by non-radiative pathways, releasing their energy in several forms, including heal, electron transfer, and probably forming at least one active oxygen species, free radicals, or both. Further, when they arc suitably administered, for example, intravenously, to a living patient, they arc rejected by healthy tissue, but not by tumors and, as a consequence, they arc still present, a suitable time after administration, in tumors of the patient to whom they were administered, but arc no longer present in adjacent healthy tissue so that they can be promoted to the singlet state by excitement at a suitable wavelength and will then destroy the tumor as they decay to the ground state. Photolhcrmal scnsitizcrs, which destroy tumors by the release of heat after they have been promoted to the singlet state, arc discussed by Jori, G. et al., Journal of Photochemistry
