<ABSTRACT>
A discharge chute especially for use in connection with a concrete carrying mixer, such as a rotating container or a like mounted on the chassis of a truck. The discharge chute (1) includes at least two substantially overlapping chute sections (1a, 1b, 1c) movable relative to each other in the longitudinal direction (s) of discharge chute (1) preferably by means of hydraulic drive mechanisms or the like. Each chute section (1a, 1b, 1c) includes an intermediate portion (a), comprising a discharge through, and edge portions (b) which are fitted with a slide-support assembly for enabling the relative movement of overlapping chute sections and for bracing the same together. The edge portions (b', b") of chute sections (1a, 1b, 1c) of discharge chute (1) are essentially identically shaped in cross section and thus adapted to be overlapped on each other and, thus, being spaced a distance from each other, essentially form said slide-support assembly.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates a discharge chute especially 
for use in connection with a concrete carrying mixer, such 
as a rotating container or a like mounted on the chassis 
of a truck. The discharge chute includes at least two 
substantially overlapping chute sections movable relative 
to each other in the longitudinal direction of the discharge 
chute preferably by means of hydraulic drive mechanisms or 
the like. Each chute section includes an intermediate 
portion, comprising at least a discharge guiding trough 
or a like, and edge portions which are fitted with a slide-support 
assembly for enabling at least the relative 
movement of overlapping chute sections and for bracing the 
same together. The most common practical way of effecting the transport 
of concrete and its further processing on a working site 
is such that concrete is carried by means of a concrete 
mixing vehicle or a concrete carrying mixer to a working 
site, wherein the concrete is most commonly further 
transferred to its deposit point by means of other 
accessories included in the vehicle. Thus, the concrete 
carrying mixer conventionally includes, in addition to a 
rotating container and a charging/discharging funnel, a 
multi-section discharge chute for removing concrete from 
the rotating container to a concrete deposit point located 
therebelow. The discharge chutes are typically operating 
on a telescopic principle for adjusting the length of a 
discharge chute whenever necessary by moving the chute 
sections included therein relative to each other in 
longitudinal direction. In the prior art, however, the 
number of chute sections is limited by the way of providing 
a slide-support assembly therebetween, whereby one section 
is provided with a guide/support bar and the other 
respectively with a tubular body surrounding said bar. 
The sliding between chute sections is effected either by  
 
slipping or rolling and, thus, slide pads or bearings are 
fitted between the guide/support bar and the tubular body. Since the above-described arrangements require that, in 
practice, a discharge chute be composed of two, not more 
than three elements, even the shortest possible discharge 
chute will be relatively long and bulky. In the present 
application this is a major drawback since the concrete 
carrying mixers are abundantly fitted with accessories. In 
addition, the chute sections as well as various slide-support 
mechanisms associated therewith must be manufactured 
to exact measurements for a guaranteed compatibility

<CLAIMS>
A discharge chute for use especially in connection with 
a concrete carrying mixer, such as a rotating container or 

a like mounted on the chassis of a truck, said discharge 
chute (1) manufactured by working continuous sheet material, 

such as by bending or in a similar fashion, and including 
at least two substantially overlapping chute sections 

movable relative to each other in the longitudinal direction 
(s) of discharge chute (1) preferably by means of 

hydraulic drive mechanisms or the like, each chute section 
(1a, 1b, 1c) including an intermediate portion (a), 

comprising a bottom wall (a1) and side walls (a2) forming 
a discharge guiding trough, and edge portions 

(b', b'') which are provided as a slide-support assembly for 
enabling at least the relative movement of overlapping 

chute sections and for bracing the same together, each 
edge portion (b', b'') of chute sections (1a, 1b, 1c) 

extending essentially towards the center (x) of the discharge 
chute (1), whereby at least some (1a, 1b, 1c) of the 

overlapping chute sections of discharge chute (1) are 
essentially identically shaped in cross-section and thus 

adapted to be overlapped on each other such that the edge 
portions (b', b'') of chute sections (1a, 1b, 1c), being 

spaced a distance from each other, essentially form said 
slide-support assembly, 
characterized
 in that the cross-section 
of each edge portion (b', b'') of each chute section (1a, 

1b, 1c) is curved and open, the shape being a semi-circular 
arc or like curved portion. 
A discharge chute as set forth in claim 1, 

characterized
 in that the side walls (a2) of intermediate 
portion (a) in chute section (1a, 1b, 1c) are provided 

with at least one extra bend (v) for increased bracing 
effect.
