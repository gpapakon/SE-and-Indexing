<ABSTRACT>
First and second members (106, 120) of a push 
chair chassis, are pivotally interconnected by a locking 

hinge (28) having a manually releasable locking mechanism 
for securing the first member (106) at a predetermined 

orientation relative to the second member (114). The first 
member (106) has a cylindrical latch-receiving surface 

(130) co-axial with the hinge axis (100) and containing a 
latching recess (132). The locking mechanism comprises a 

detent (124) mounted on the second member (114) engageable 
in the latching recess (132) and a spring (128) for 

biassing the detent (124) into engagement with the latch-receiving 
surface (130). The detent (124) is coupled to a 

sliding sleeve (120), which is used to manually displace 
the detent (124) to a disengaged position clear of the 

latch-receiving surface (130). A pawl (140) then retains 
the detent (124) in its disengaged position until a cam 

(152) causes disengagement thereof when the first member 
(106) is at a second predetermined orientation relative to 

the second member (114).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a locking hinge of the 
type having first and second members pivotally 
interconnected for relative angular movement about a hinge 
axis and a manually releasable locking mechanism for 
securing the first member at a predetermined orientation 
relative to the second member, wherein the first member has 
a cylindrical latch-receiving surface co-axial with the 
hinge axis and containing a latching recess and the locking 
mechanism comprises a detent mounted on the second member 
engageable in the latching recess, a spring for biassing 
the detent into engagement with the latch-receiving 
surface, manually operable release means for displacing the 
detent to a disengaged position clear of the latch-receiving 
surface, automatically engaging interlock means 
for retaining the detent in its disengaged position, and 
cam means for causing disengagement of the interlock means 
when the first member is at a second predetermined 
orientation relative to the second member. A locking hinge of this type is disclosed in US-A-4645371. 
The manually operable release means comprises a 
lever which has to be pivoted in order to disengage the 
detent. The present invention aims to provide a locking 
joint which can be released by gripping one of the 
pivotally interconnected members. According to the invention, in a locking hinge of 
the type described above, the detent is fast with the 
manually operable release means which is slidably mounted 
on the second member. An embodiment of the invention will now be 
described, by way of example, with reference to the 
accompanying drawings, in which: 
Figure 1 is a side view of a pushchair having 
locking hinges in accordance with the invention erected for 
use and with the seat back in its upright position; Figure 2 is a front view of the pushchair shown in 
Figure 1; Figure 3 is a rear view of the pushchair shown in  
 
Figure 1; Figure 4 is a side view of the pushchair shown in 
Figure 1 but with the pushchair frame partly folded; Figure 5 is a side view of the pushchair shown in 
Figure 1 but with the frame fully folded; Figure 6 is a plan view of one of the locking 
hinges of the pushchair shown in Figures 1 to 5; Figure 7 is a schematic sectional view of the 
locking hinge shown in Figure 6, in an engaged position; 
and Figure 8 is a schematic sectional view of the 
locking hinge shown in Figure 6 and 7, in a released 
position. Referring to Figures 1 and 2, a pushchair 
comprises a one-piece U-shaped unit forming a handle 10, a 
pair of handle

<CLAIMS>
A locking hinge having first and second members 
(106, 114) pivotally interconnected for relative angular 

movement about a hinge axis (100) and a manually releasable 
locking mechanism for securing the first member (106) at a 

predetermined orientation relative to the second member 
(114), wherein the first member (106) has a cylindrical 

latch-receiving surface (130) co-axial with the hinge axis 
(100) and containing a latching recess (132) and the 

locking mechanism comprises a detent (124) mounted on the 
second member (114) engageable in the latching recess 

(132), a spring (128) for biassing the detent (124) into 
engagement with the latch-receiving surface (130), manually 

operable release means (120) for displacing the detent 
(124) to a disengaged position clear of the latch-receiving 

surface (130), automatically engaging interlock means (140) 
for retaining the detent (124) in its disengaged position, 

and cam means (152) for causing disengagement of the 
interlock means (140) when the first member (106) is at a 

second predetermined orientation relative to the second 
member (114), characterised in that the detent (124) is 

fast with the manually operable release means (120) which 
is slidably mounted on the second member (114).
