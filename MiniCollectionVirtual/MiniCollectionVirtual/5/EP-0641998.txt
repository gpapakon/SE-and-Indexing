<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for measuring the flow of a liquid flowing through a measuring tube, having a coil arranged above the measuring tube, a coil arranged below the measuring tube and two electrodes arranged opposite each other on the sides of the measuring tube, in which device the coils can be excited to generate magnetic fields in the same direction and in opposite directions and a correction circuit is provided. The correction circuit corrects the voltage between the electrodes, which voltage is only approximately proportional to the flow of the liquid in the case of magnetic fields in the same direction and partial filling of the measuring tube, by means of a correction function to form an output signal proportional to the flow of the liquid in the case of partial filling of the measuring tube, to form a corrected voltage which is a function of the voltages between the electrodes in the case of magnetic fields in the same direction and in opposite directions. The invention is characterised in that an electrode to register the complete filling of the measuring tube is arranged on top of the measuring tube and in that, using the potential from this electrode, a switching device is controlled which, in the case of complete filling of the measuring tube, emits the voltage corresponding to the magnetic fields in the same direction as output signal and, in the case of partial filling of the measuring tube, emits the corrected voltage as output signal.

A device for measuring the flow of a fluid flowing through a
measuring pipe (2), comprising


a coil (4) arranged above said measuring pipe (2),
a coil (6) arranged below said measuring pipe (2), and
a pair of electrodes (8, 10) facing one another on the sides
of said measuring pipe (2),
wherein the coils (4, 6) are excitable for producing aiding
and opposing magnetic fields, and
a correction circuit (28) is provided for correcting the voltage
(U
r
) between said electrodes (8, 10) only approximately
proportionate to the flow of the fluid in the presence of aiding

magnetic fields and partial filling of said measuring pipe (2) to
an output signal (S) proportionate to the flow of the fluid when

the measuring pipe (2) is partly filled by means of a correction
function to a corrected voltage (U
t
) depending on the voltages
(U
r
, U
g
) between the electrodes in the presence of aiding and
opposing magnetic fields,
characterized in
that an electrode (32) is arranged at the top of said measuring
pipe (2) for detecting complete filling of said measuring pipe

(2), and
that by means of the potential of said electrode (32) circuit
means (34, 36) are controlled which when the measuring pipe

(2) is completely filled generate the voltage (U
r
) corresponding
to the aiding magnetic fields as an output signal (S) and when

the measuring pipe (2) is partly filled generate the corrected
voltage (U
t
) as an output signal (S).
