<CLAIMS>
A process for the preparation of acylcyclopropanes 
of the general formula I 


 
where R
1
 is an aliphatic radical having 1 to 4 C atoms 
and R
2
 is one of the radicals R
1
 or hydrogen, using 
catalysts which are known per se for this reaction, which 

comprises reacting a 3-acyltetrahydrofuran-2-one of the 
general formula II 


 
in the gas phase at elevated temperature on a catalyst 

bed. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
catalysts used are salts of hydrohalic acids on solid 

supports. 
A process as claimed in claim 2, wherein the 
catalysts used are salts of hydrogen bromide or hydrogen 

iodide on solid supports. 
A process as claimed in claims 1 to 3, wherein 
zinc oxide or titanium dioxide is used as solid support.
