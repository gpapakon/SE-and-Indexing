<ABSTRACT>
A cleaning method and apparatus that provides lubrication to a secondary detoning 
roll (112) in a cleaner brush system, thus reducing cleaning failures. The toner particles 

removed from the first detoning roll (111) are transported to the second detoning roll (112). 
This allows lubrication of the second detoning roll (112) and reduces the wear problem of the 

second detoning roll (112) due to lack of lubrication.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to an electrophotographic printing device, and more
particularly, a lubricating system in the cleaner apparatus that lubricates a detoning roll.In an electrophotographic application such as xerography, a charge retentive surface
(e.g. photoconductor, photoreceptor or imaging surface) is electrostatically charged, and
exposed to a light pattern of an original image to be reproduced to selectively discharge the
surface in accordance therewith. The resulting pattern of charged and discharged areas on
that surface form an electrostatic charge pattern (an electrostatic latent image) conforming to
the original image. The latent image is developed by contacting it with a finely divided
electrostatically attractable powder referred to as "toner". Toner is held on the image areas by
the electrostatic charge on the surface. Thus, a toner image is produced in conformity with a
light image of the original being reproduced. The toner image may then be transferred to a
substrate (e.g. paper), and the image affixed to form a permanent record of the image to be
reproduced. Subsequent to development, excess toner left on the charge retentive surface is
cleaned from the surface. The process is well known, and useful, for light lens copying from an
original or printing applications from electronically generated or stored originals such as with a
raster output scanner (ROS) where a charge surface may be imagewise discharged in a variety
of ways. Ion projection devices, where a charge is imagewise deposited on a charge retentive
substrate, operates similarly.In a reproduction process ot the type as described above, it is inevitable that some
residual toner will remain on the photoconductor surface after the toner image has been
transferred to the sheet of support material (e.g. paper). It has been found that with such a
process the forces holding some of the toner particles to the imaging surface are stronger than
the transfer force and, therefore, some of the particles remain on the surface after transfer of
the toner image. In addition to the residual toner, other particles, such as paper debris (i.e.
Kaolin, fibers, clay), additives and plastic, are left behind on the surface after image transfer.
(Hereinafter, the term "residual particles" encompasses residual toner and other residual
debris remaining after image transfer.) The residual particles adhere firmly to the surface and
must be removed prior to the next printing cycle to avoid it interfering with recording a new
latent image
