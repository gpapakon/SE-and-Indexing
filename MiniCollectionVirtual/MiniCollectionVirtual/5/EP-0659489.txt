<ABSTRACT>
A means for generating air bubbles in a liquid comprises 
a turbine rotor (21) which has a plurality of peripheral 

blades (24) and an air supply line (26) situated adjacent 
the outer periphery of the turbine rotor for supplying 

air. The air supply line (26) has at least one air 
supply port (26a) directed towards the turbine rotor. 

The rotor body (25) is in the form of a cylindrical cage 
and is constructed from four equispaced parallel disc-shaped 

ribs (23a, 23b) which have the same coaxial 
diameter.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to means for generating air bubbles in a liquid,
particularly for use in a flotation machine for de-inking waste paper stock,
comprising a turbine rotor in the form of a cage including a plurality of peripheral
blades or rods, which define spaces between them, and means for supplying
pressurised air in the vicinity of the rotary member. Such flotation machines are
used in waste paper recovery installations for defiberising and cleaning waste
paper and reconverting it into paper making material. In such a machine, bubbles
are produced in the stock liquid in a flotation cell and ink and other particles, such
as oil and pitch, which were attached to the paper are adsorbed by the bubbles and
carried to the liquid surface by buoyancy in the form of froth which is then
removed via a froth receptacle.Methods of de-inking waste paper are in general divided into three types, namely
the flotation method, the washing method and a combination thereof.In the flotation method, the smaller the diameters of the bubbles, the more readily
the fine ink particles are adsorbed by them. It is therefore important for efficient
operation of the flotation method that the total surface area of the bubbles is large,
that the bubbles are uniformly distributed in the waste paper stock liquid and that
the residence time of the bubbles in the stock liquid is long. For the same quantity
of air which is added to the stock liquid, the finer the bubbles, the larger is the
total surface of the bubbles and thus the slower is the flotation speed of the
bubbles. The efficiency of the flotation method is therefore principally
determined by the uniform admixing of a larger quantity of fine air bubbles to the 
stock liquid and by the effectiveness of their removal as froth from the liquid.Formerly, printing ink adhered relatively weakly to paper fibres and was
relatively readily separable. The quality requirements for de-inked pulp were also
not particularly high. As a result, known flotation machines could attain
satisfactory results with a relatively small quantity of air and the resultant
relatively short residence time of the bubbles.Recently, problems have arisen which can not be solved by the known de-inking
technique using the flotation method. Firstly, the adhesion strength of printing ink
to paper has increased as printing techniques have been developed or refined, such
as the use of the offset process for printing newspapers, so that mechanical force
is required to separate the ink resulting in the

flotation cell defining a reservoir for a stock liquid which, in use, forms a free

liquid surface in the cell, a froth receptacle at the upper portion of the cell for
receiving froth floating up to the free liquid surface, a stock inlet at one end of

the cell for supplying the stock liquid, a stock outlet at the other end of the cell
for discharging the stock liquid and at least one rotary air bubble generating 

means situated within the lower portion of the cell, characterised in that the
rotary air bubble generating means (3) extends between the two ends of the cell
