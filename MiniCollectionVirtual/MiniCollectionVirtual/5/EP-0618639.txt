<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an antenna for use in, for
example, a communication base station.Conventionally, the angle of beam orientation of a strip
line is fixed.This conventional feed line unitary antenna is exemplified
by a microstrip antenna as shown in FIG. 29 of the accompanying
drawings, which is reillustrated from "Handbook of Microstrip
Antennas vol. 2" by J.R. James and P.S. Hall, pp. 1076, Figs. 18.17
and 18.18, Peter Peregrinus Ltd., London, United Kingdom, 1989. In
FIG. 29, reference numerals 1a, 1b designate a microstrip antenna;
2, an upper conductor of a microstrip line; 3, an earth conductor;
and 4, a dielectric plate.In FIG. 29, part of the electric power from the microstrip
line 2 is supplied to the microstrip antenna 1a, and then the
electric power passing through the microstrip antenna 1a is
supplied to the next microstrip antenna 1b. As the individual
microstrip antennas 1a, 1b are excited by certain amplitude and
phase distribution, the antenna apparatus forms a beam pattern in
space. However, the known antenna apparatus has a problem that the
angle of beam orientation cannot be varied in the same frequency, 
as long as the shape of the antenna system such as the length of
the feed line and/or the spacing of the antennas are changed. In
general, in order to scan the antenna beam, each antenna element
is equipped with a phase shifter; however, no low-cost small-size
phase shifter suitable for the antenna of FIG. 29 is known at the
present time.FIG. 30 shows an antenna system for performing communication
between a number of mobile stations and a data terminal or
telephone using the antenna apparatus of FIG. 29.In FIG. 30, reference numerals 100 - 102 designate mobile
stations each equipped with a transmitter /receiver for
communication with another station using a different frequency. A
base station (fixed station) 103 includes, transmission/receiving
antennas 1, 1', a local oscillator 105, a transmission modulator
104 for modulating transmission signals by a high frequency signal
of the local oscillator 105, and first and second receiving
demodulators 106, 107 for demodulating receiving signals by a high
frequency signal of the local oscillator 105. The base station 103
further includes a line connector 108, a controller 109 for
controlling the line connection of the line connector 108, and a
communication processor 110 for processing transmission data of
the mobile station 100 - 102 and other data from a data terminal
112, another base station 113, a telephone, etc. The switching
