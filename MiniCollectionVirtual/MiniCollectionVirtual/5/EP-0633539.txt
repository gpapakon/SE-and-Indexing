<ABSTRACT>
A comment added to a certain portion in a first 
document can be automatically re-added to an equivalent 

position in a second document, and comment transfer 
processing between documents is automatically performed. 

Position information of a comment with respect to an old 
document obtained from an old document comment file is 

stored in a position information area, and comment 
contents also obtained from the old document comment 

file are stored in a comment content area. A character 
string corresponding to the position information is 

extracted from an old document file, and is stored in a 
character string area. A new document file is searched 

on the basis of the character string stored in the 
character string area, and position information of the 

detected character string is stored in a candidate area. 
One of position information stored in the candidate area 

is selected according to a predetermined rule, and the 
selected position information is stored in a new 

position information area. The comment contents stored 
in the comment content area, and the position 

information stored in the new position information area 
are written in a new document comment file.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a document
processing method and apparatus, which can add
additional data such as a comment to a document.A document processing apparatus, with which a user
can add some comments to a portion of a document (e.g.,
a manual) stored in, e.g., a floppy disk, is known. Fig.
102 shows an example of a document (to be referred to as
an original document hereinafter) furnished with a
comment, and the display state of the comment. On a CRT
screen 120, two windows are displayed. An original
document is displayed on a text window 111, and a
comment is displayed on a comment window 112. Therefore,
the original document and the comment are displayed on
different windows, and the position of the original
document where the comment is added is represented by a
line 113 connecting the two windows.In this case, as a method of adding a comment to an
original document, a special code as link information
may be embedded in original document data. The comment
is linked with the original document by the link
information embedded in the original document, and the
comment can be displayed by following the link
information. Therefore, in the method of embedding the 
link information in the original document, a user who
adds a comment must have an authority of embedding link
information in an original document. In such an
original document file, the same comment is displayed
for any users who open the file. If another user added
a comment, then the added comment is displayed. The
contents (sentences) of the comment and the original
document may be stored in the same file or in different
files.As a method of adding a comment for a user who
cannot modify an original document, an original document
and a comment are stored in different files (an original
document file and a comment file), and when the comment
and the original document are to be displayed, a system
is started by inputting IDs (e.g., file names) of the
two files, so as to link and display these data. In
this case, information indicating a correspondence
between the comment and the position of the original
document is possessed by the comment file. For example,
the comment file has position information indicating a
correspondence between a comment and the ordinal number
of the character in question from the beginning of the
original document file.In this method, each user can independently have a
comment file, respectively, and the original document
file is shared by all users. For this reason, no 
authority of modifying the original

A method according to claim 55, further comprising
the third memory step of extracting additional data which

is not stored in the second memory step (S96) from the
additional data stored in the first memory step, and 

storing (S99) the extracted additional data.
A method according to claim 60, wherein the second
memory step comprises:


storing (S96), in a data file (54), the equivalent
portion as the second position information when the

equivalent portion is detected in the search step (S93);
and
the third memory step comprises storing (S99) the
additional data in the data file (54) to be identifiable

from the additional data stored in the second memory step
when an equivalent portion is not detected in the search

step (S93).
A method according to claim 60, further comprising
the display step (S172) of identifiably displaying the

additional data stored in the second memory step and
(S167) the additional data stored in the third memory

step upon display of the second document.
A method according to claim 60, wherein the third
memory step comprises storing (S98) position information

indicating a position near the addition position
represented by the first position information as second

position information representing the addition position
of the additional data in the second document in

correspondence with the additional data, when an 
equivalent portion is not detected in the search step

(S93).
A method according to claim 60, wherein:

the first document is constituted by a plurality of
document elements (81, 82, 811, 812, 813), the first

position information representing a document element to
which the additional data is added;
the search step (S193) comprises searching a second
document for a document element equivalent to the

document element specified by the first position
information as the equivalent portion;
the second memory step (S197) comprises storing
information representing the document element, detected

in the search step as the second position information;
and
the third memory step comprises selecting (S195) a
document element near a position corresponding to the

document element represented by the first position
information in the second document, and storing (S197)

second position information representing the selected
document element in correspondence with the additional

data, when an equivalent portion is not detected in the
search step (S193).
A method according to claim 60, wherein:

the first document is constituted by a plurality of 
document elements (81, 82, 811, 812, 813), the first

position information representing an addition position
of the additional data in the first document; and
the third memory step (S195) comprises selecting a
document element (81, 82, 811, 812, 813) including the

position, represented by the first position information,
in the second document, and storing information

representing the selected document element as the second
position information in correspondence with the

additional data, when an equivalent portion is not
detected in the search step (S193).
A method according to claim 55, further comprising
the storage step (S218) of storing the additional data

in a predetermined area (68) of the second document when
an equivalent portion is not detected in the search step.
A method according to claim 55, further comprising:

the storage step of storing document data, including
the first and second documents;
the first display step of displaying contents of the
document data and the additional data;
the discrimination step (S251) of discriminating
whether or not the addition position is present within

a range of the document data currently displayed in the
first display step;
the second display step of displaying a 
correspondence between the additional data and the

addition position when it is discriminated in the
discrimination step that the addition position is present

within the currently displayed range of the document
data; and
the third display step (S253) of identifiably
displaying that the addition position falls outside the

currently displayed range, and displaying (S253) a
correspondence between the document data and the

additional data when it is discriminated in the
discrimination step that the addition position is not

present within the currently displayed range of the
document data.
A computer program product programmed with machine
readable instructions for causing the document processing

apparatus to perform a method according to any one of
claims 55 to 68.
