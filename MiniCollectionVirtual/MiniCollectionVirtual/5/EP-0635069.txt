<ABSTRACT>
Method and composition for detecting one or more selected polynucleotide regions in a target polynucleotide. In practicing the method, a plurality of different-sequence probe pairs are added to a target polynucleotide, where each probe pair includes two polynucleotide probe elements which are complementary in sequence to adjacent portions of a selected one of the target sequences in the target polynucleotide. In each probe pair, one of the probe elements contains a non-polynucleotide polymer chain which imparts a distinctive elctrophoretic mobility in a sieving matrix, to the associated probe pair, when the elements in the pair are ligated. The other element in the pair contains a detectable reporter label. After the probe pairs have been allowed to hybridize with the target polynucleotide, the hybridized polynucleotides are treated under conditions effective to ligate the end subunits of target-bound probe elements when their end subunits are base-paired with adjacent target bases. The ligated probe pairs are then released from the target polynucleotide and separated electrophoretically in a sieving matrix, or chromatographically.

available for detecting the presence of one or more 
selected polynucleotide sequences in a sample 
containing a large number of sequence regions. In a 
simple method, which relies on fragment capture and 
labeling, a fragment containing a selected sequence is 
captured by hybridization to an immobilized probe. The 
captured fragment can be labeled by hybridization to a 
second probe which contains a detectable reporter 
label. Another widely used method is Southern blotting. 
In this method, a mixture of DNA fragments in a sample 
are fractionated by gel electrophoresis, then fixed on 
a nitrocellulose filter. By reacting the filter with 
one or more labeled probes under hybridization 
conditions, the presence of bands containing the probe 
sequence can be
