<ABSTRACT>
A process for the hydrogenation of a selected aromatic, such as benzene contained in a naphtha stream to cyclohexane wherein the distillation column reactor (10) is operated such that the portion of the naphtha containing the benzene is maintained in the catalyst bed such that essentially only benzene is hydrogenated. The reactor is operated at a pressure wherein the reaction mixture is boiling under low hydrogen partial pressure in the range of about 0.1 psi to less than 70 psia at 0 to 350 psig. The catalyst is provided as a catalytic distillation structure (12) such that the reaction is concurrently occurring with a distillation. A portion of the overheads is returned as reflux to provide cooling within the catalyst bed and concurrent condensation of some of the gaseous material within the bed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the selective
hydrogenation of benzene in a stream, such as naphtha to
make cyclohexane and reduce the benzene content. More
particularly the invention relates to a process wherein
the hydrogenation of the benzene and separation of the
cyclohexane product by distillation is carried out
simultaneously in a distillation column reactor. More
particularly the invention relates to a process wherein
the benzene is contained in a light naphtha stream from a
cracking process or from a catalytic reformer wherein the
stream also contains toluene. Most particularly the
invention relates to a process for the hydrogenation of
the benzene contained in a light naphtha stream with very
little hydrogenation of the toluene or other aromatics.The reduction in the lead content of gasolines
and the ban on use of lead anti-knock compounds have lead
to a search for other ways to improve the octane number of
blending components for gasoline. The alternatives to
uses of lead anti-knock compounds are chemical processing
and the use of other additives.One common process long used by the refinery
industry to upgrade raw naphtha to high octane gasoline is
catalytic reforming. In catalytic reforming the raw
naphtha having a boiling range of circa 46 to 177°C
(115-350°F) is passed over an alumina supported noble
metal catalyst at elevated temperatures of circa 493 to
510°C (920-950°F) and moderate pressure of circa 1480 to
3894 kPa (200-550 psig). The catalyst "reforms" the
molecular structures of the hydrocarbons contained in the
raw naphtha by removing hydrogen and rearranging the
structure of the molecules so as to improve the octane
number of the naphtha. However, the increase in octane
number also reduces the liquid volume of the naphtha as
the specific gravity is increased.Because of the multiplicity of the compounds in the raw 
naphtha, the actual reactions which occur in catalytic
reforming are numerous. However, some of the many resulting
products are aryl or aromatic compounds, all of which exhibit
high octane numbers. The aryl compounds produced depend upon
the starting materials which in a refinery are controlled by
the boiling range of the naphtha used and the crude oil source.
The "reformed" product from a catalytic reforming process is
commonly called reformate and is often separated into two
fractions by conventional distillations--a light reformate
having a boiling range of circa 46 to 121°C (115-250°F) and a
heavy reformate having a boiling range of circa 121 to 177°C
(250-350°F).
