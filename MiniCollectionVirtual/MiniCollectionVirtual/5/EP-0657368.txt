<ABSTRACT>
A container for carrying and dispensing liquid and 
semi-liquid products includes an inner product tank (3) received 

within an outer protective tank (5). The inner tank receives the 
liquid or semi-liquid product to be transported from one location 

to another, while the outer tank protects the inner tank from 
punctures and other damage during transport of the container, and 

during discharge and refill of product in the inner tank. The 
outer tank has downwardly extending support legs (35), which enable 

separate containers to be stacked atop each other. The support 
legs of the outer tank transfer the stacking load from the top 

surface to the bottom surface of the outer tank legs and for 
reducing load stresses on the inner tank holding the liquid or 

semi-liquid product. The inner and outer tanks cooperate with 
each other to facilitate drainage and cleaning of the inner tank, 

and for protection of a product pump including a discharge hose, 
while one or more tanks are stacked atop each other during 

transit. A sight window (9) on the surfaces of the inner and outer 
tanks, and a product tube (13) extending into the inner tank, provide 

an observable indication of the quantity of product remaining in 
the inner product tank. The container provides a system for 

safely and efficiently transporting liquid and semi-liquid 
products together with the equipment necessary for selectively 

discharging the product from the container at the desired 
location.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to containers for carrying and
dispensing liquid and semi-liquid products, and in particular
hazardous products. Such a container is, for example, known from
WO-A-88 03 899.It is axiomatic that hazardous liquid products, including
agricultural treatment agents such as herbicides, pesticides,
fertilizer and the like, must be safely transported from one
location to another. Liquid and semi-liquid products of this
type are commonly transported from supply or filling stations to
locations in which the materials are to be dispensed for
application to areas to be treated, in containers carried on
trucks or trains. It is important that the products within the
containers be well protected in transit, and that the-containers
be of sufficient strength and construction to avoid puncture or
rupture during transportion, particularly in the event of
accident. It is also important that the containers be designed
to be capable of being transported in an economical and efficient
manner.It is the primary object of the present invention to provide
an improved container for storing, transporting, and dispensing
liquid and semi-liquid products, particularly so-called hazardous
products, in a safer and more economical and efficient manner
than is presently available by the known conventional containers. 
Further objects of the invention are to provide a container which
is designed to facilitate cleaning and drainage thereof, and a
container including means for storing discharge equipment
including a pump and discharge hose while the tank is being
transported. A further object of the present invention is to
provide simple means for indicating the quantity of product
remaining within the container by visual observation therein.
Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become
apparent from the following description and discussion of the
invention in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. The container system in accordance with the present
invention includes a first inner container for receiving and
holding a liquid or semi-liquid product to be stored, transported
and discharged by the container system. The inner tank is
received within an outer tank which is provided to protect the
the inner tank and the product stored therein from punctures,
ruptures and other structural damage which might otherwise result
in leakage or unintended discharge of the product. The inner and
outer tanks have spherical contoured upper and lower surfaces to
facilitate product drainage from the
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A container (1) for storing, transporting and dispensing liquid and semi-liquid
product, said container (1) comprising:


a first inner tank (3) for receiving and holding said product,
a second outer tank (5) for removably receiving therein said first inner tank
(3),
port means (7) in said container (1) for supplying said product to said inner
tank (3),
discharge means (19) for selectively discharging said product in said inner
tank (3) from said container (1),

whereby said container (1) is characterized by
a plurality of supporting legs (35) extending downwardly from a bottom
surface of said outer tank (5) of said container (1) and
a plurality of projections (41) extending upwardly from an upper surface of
said outer tank (5), said projections being substantially aligned with said

downwardly extending supporting legs (35) on said outer tank (5) and being
provided for supporting another container in stacked relationship atop said

projections (41).
The container (1) as claimed in Claim 1 wherein said discharge means (19)
includes a discharge port in said container (1).
The container (1) as claimed in Claim 2 wherein said discharge means (19)
includes a recessed portion in a top surface of said outer tank (5) of said

container (1) for receiving a discharge pump (17), said discharge port being
defined in said recessed portion.
The container (1) as claimed in Claim 1 wherein a bottom surface of said 
inner tank (3) defines a recessed portion.
The container (1) as claimed in Claim 4 wherein said recessed portion is
defined substantially in the center of said bottom surface of said inner tank

(3), said bottom surface of said inner tank (3) being inclined downwardly
towards said recessed portion for causing product flow into said recessed

portion as a result of gravitational forces.
The container (1) as claimed in Claim 1 further including means for indicating
the quantity of said product in said inner tank (3), said means for indicating

including a translucent tapered tube-like element extending into said inner
tank (3).
The container (1) as claimed in Claim 1 wherein said inner tank (3) includes a
lower surface, said lower surface defining a recessed portion thereon, said

lower surface being inclined relative to said recessed portion such that said
product in said inner tank (3) is caused to flow down said lower surface and

into said recessed portion as a result of gravitational forces.
The container (1) as claimed in Claim 1 wherein said outer tank (5) is formed
from upper and lower sections removably connected together in a slip fit

engaging relationship.
The container (1) as claimed in Claim 1 wherein a recessed portion is defined
between said upwardly extending projections (41) in said upper surface of

said outer tank (5), said recessed portion defining a compartment (15) for
receiving a discharge pump (17).
