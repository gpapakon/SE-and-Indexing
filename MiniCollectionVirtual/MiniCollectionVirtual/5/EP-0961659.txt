Process for regulating agricultural spray nozzles consisting in controlling,
according to treatment parameters, the flow rate of a treatment product

spread by a set of nozzles (1) by adjusting with the aid of a means of
adjustment the dimension of the discharge orifice (1c) of said nozzles (1) so

as to obtain a given opening or a closing of said discharge orifice (1c) and
doing so according to values relating to information emanating from

sensors or settings, 
characterized in
 that
 it consists in using at least one
piezoelectric element as the means of adjustment.
Process according to Claim 1, 
characterized in
 that
 it consists in acting on
each noz
zle (1) individually or on a selection of nozzles (1).
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in
 that
 it consists in using
electronic means or a microcomputer to produce flow rates which are

compatible with the treatment parameters.
Process according to Claim 3, 
characterized in
 that
 it consists in managing,
with the aid of the microcomputer, the operation of the sprayer (10).
Process according to Claim 3 or 4, 
characterized in
 that
 it consists in
analyzing data linked with the operation of the sprayer (10) and/or of the

nozzles (1) and making automatic corrections as a function of information
stored.
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in
 that
 it
consists in acting on the configuration of the discharge orifice (1c) of the

nozzles (1) so as to modify the shape of the jets (7) of the treatment product
discharged. 
Process according to Claim 6, 
characterized in
 that
 it consists in fitting the
distance between the nozzles (1) and the zone to be treated, according to

the configuration of the jets (7).
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in
 that
 it
consists in using electrical signals to control a given opening or a closing of

the discharge orifice (1c) of the nozzles (1).
Agricultural spray nozzle (1) comprising a nozzle body (1a) provided with
at least one inlet orifice (1b) and at least one discharge orifice (1c) for a

treatment product, said nozzle (1) comprising means of adjustment for
acting on the dimensions of the discharge orifice (1c) and thus modifying

the opening of said nozzle (1), 
characterized in
 that
 the means of
adjustment comprise at least one piezoelectric element.
Spray nozzle (1) according to Claim 9, 
characterized in
 that
 the means of
adjustment are built into the nozzle body (1a).
Spray nozzle (1) according to Claim 9 or 10, 
characterized in
 that
 it is
associated with a control unit intended for transmitting electrical signals to

the means of adjustment.
Spray nozzle (1) according to any one of Claims 9 to 11, 
characterized in

that
 it comprises at least one closure element (3, 4) mounted in the nozzle
body (1a) and which can be moved under the effect of the means of

adjustment between positions corresponding to closure and to calibrated
openings of the discharge orifice (1c).
Spray nozzle (1) according to Claim 12, 
characterized in
 that
 it comprises
two closure elements (3) and (4) of complementary shape and cooperating 

with one another in such a way as to define and adjust the dimension of the
discharge orifice (1c), said closure elements (3, 4) being actuated by the

means of adjustment.
Spray nozzle according to any one of Claims 9 to 13, 
characterized in
 that

the means of adjustment comprise two piezoelectric chips (5, 6).
Agricultural spray nozzle according to any one of Claims 12 to 14,

characterized in
 that
 it comprises at least at the interface of the nozzle body
(1a) and of the closure element(s) (3, 4), an elastically deformable material

(2) whose elasticity makes it possible to absorb the movements of said
closure element(s) (3, 4).
Spray boom (11) comprising nozzles (1) in accordance with any one of
Claims 9 to 15.
Agricultural sprayer (10) provided with spray nozzles (1) in accordance
with any one of Claims 9 to 16.
