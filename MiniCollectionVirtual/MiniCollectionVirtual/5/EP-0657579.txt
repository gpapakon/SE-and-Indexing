<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a press section of a paper 
machine, through which press section the paper web 

(W) is passed as a closed draw on support of a 
press fabric (11,28,36) and of a smooth roll face 

(31,39'). The first nip in the press section is an 
extended-nip press (NP₁) through whose press zone 

two opposite press fabrics (11,28) that receive water 
have been passed. The upper press fabric in the 

extended-nip press (NP₁) is a pick-up fabric (11), 
which carries the paper web (W) from the forming 

wire (10). In the press section, there are at least two 
other nips (N₁,N₂;NP₂',NP₃') that have been 

formed in connection with the smooth-faced (31) 
centre roll (30). The centre roll (30) is fitted at a 

level higher (H₁) than the level of the extended-nip 
press (NP₁). In the first one of the other nips (N₁; 

NP₂'), the press fabric consists of the pick-up fabric 
(11), and the second other nip (N₂;NP₃') has a 

press fabric (33) of its own that receives water. 
After the extended-nip press (NP₁), the running 

direction of the paper web (W) has been turned at 
an angle a, which has been chosen as a ≧ ∼45°.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a paper machine comprising a former section and a press section
for dewatering a paper web formed on a forming wire of the former section, wherein the press section
comprises at least three consecutive nips and wherein
the paper web to be dewatered is passed as a substantially closed draw
on support of a press fabric and of a smooth roll face through the press section.It is known from prior art, in the press sections following after the former section of
a paper machine, to use one or several extended-nip presses, whose press zone in the
running direction of the web is substantially longer than in roll press nips. Earlier,
extended-nip presses were used more commonly in board machines and with thicker
paper grades only, but extended-nip presses are also being introduced with thinner
paper grades, such as newsprint and fine papers.With respect to the prior art most closely related to the present invention, reference
is made to the following documents : FI-B-91898
(equivalent to DE-A-3808293), DE-U-8805966,
DE-A-4026021,
FI-B-75,382, FI-B-72 159, US-A-4,257,844,
US-A-4,704,192, and US-A-5,120,399. Further, reference is made to the paper in the journal
Wochenblatt für Papierfabrikation 19 (1993), pages 180...182 "Die Flexonip®-Pressen",
which paper describes some of the latest extended-nip press constructions
of Messrs. J.M. Voith GmbH.The prior-art press sections, including those described in the documents mentioned
above, have involved certain problems and need of development, which have
contributed to justifying the present invention. The most important ones of these
problems and drawbacks will be dealt with in the following. In the press sections described in document FI-B-91898 (Figs. 3 and 4), a
drawback is the transfer of the web from one extended-nip press into the second
and/or third extended-nip press on the face of the glide-belt mantle of the extended-nip
press, because that requires a smooth face which does not receive water and
which has good web transfer and adhesion properties. In this document, the first
nip is not an extended nip that removes water efficiently in both directions, and the
overall concept is not a compact press section of several nips.In document DE-U-88 05 966, the drawbacks include, above all in the embodiments
shown in Figs. 1 and 2, the press section consisting of two separate extended-nip
presses alone, in which press section the high-load pressing in both of the
extended nips is carried out on the face of the same press felt and, moreover, the
