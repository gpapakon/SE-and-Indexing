<ABSTRACT>
A container (1; 1a; 1b), consisting of a bottom (2) and a structure (5; 5a; 5b) which is designed to be collapsible flat on said bottom, has catch elements (45; 45a) which are arranged on a bottom frame (4) assigned to the bottom and which engage in corresponding catch receivers (55) when the structure (5; 5a; 5b) is set up, for the purpose of increasing the static and dynamic load-bearing capacity and of simplified handling during transportation.

<CLAIMS>
Container (1; 1a; 1b) having a base (2) and placed thereon a flat-collapsible
structure (5; 5a; 5b) wherein the structure (5; 5a; 5b), which is cuboid-shaped

in the erected state, consists of longitudinal walls (53) and end walls
(51) which are mutually connected in an articulated manner, having a base

frame (4) which is disposed on the base (2) in an outer circumferential
manner and which base frame is provided with latching elements (45; 45a,

46; 47) which cooperate therewith when the structure (5) is in the erected
state, characterised in that the latching elements (45, 45a, 46, 47) are

disposed on the base frame (4) in an inwardly directed manner and can be
brought into engagement with corresponding latch receiving devices ( 55; 56;

57) of the structure (5) when the said structure is unfolded into its cuboid-form
standing vertically on the base (4) and the structure (5; 5a; 5b) can be

folded flat on the base within the contour of the base (2).
Container according to claim 1, characterised in that the base (2) supports
within its contour on its side remote from the structure (5; 5a; 5b) a

construction (3) which can be driven under and which is formed from
individual bearers (31, 32) which are disposed adjacent to the contour, and

from connecting battens (33) which mutually connect at least the bearers
along two mutually parallel sides of the base (2).
Container according to claim 2, characterised in that the bearers formed by
the carrier bearers (31) and corner bearers (32) and the connecting battens

(33) are disposed inwardly offset with respect to the contour of the base (2)
for the purpose of engaging behind the upper wall region of another erected

container (1; 1a; 1b).
Container according to claim 2, characterised in that the bearers formed by
the carrier bearers (31) and corner bearers (32) and the connecting battens 

(33) are disposed in such a manner as they lie outwardly flush with the base
(2) and at least the connecting battens (33) comprise fixing elements (34)

which are offset inwardly with respect to the contour of the base (2) for the
purpose of engaging behind the upper wall region of another erected

container (1; 1a; 1b).
Container according to any one or several of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the latching elements are formed as spigots (45; 45a)

and the latch receiving devices are formed as orifices (55).
Container according to any one or several of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the latching elements are formed as an angle bracket

(46) and the latch receiving devices are formed as slots (56).
Container according to any one or several of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the latching elements are formed as angle bracket

fittings (47) placed on the base frame (4) and the latch receiving devices are
formed as slots disposed in the corner region of two walls (51, 53) which in

the erected state of the structure (5b) mutually abut each other.
Container according to claim 5, characterised in that the longitudinal walls
(53) comprise two orifices (55) and the base frame (4) comprises four

corresponding spigots (45; 45a).
Container according to claim 6, characterised in that each longitudinal wall
(53) comprises approximately in the centre a slot (56) and the base frame (4)

comprises a corresponding angle bracket (46).
Container according to any one or several of the preceding claims 5 to 9,
characterised in that all the latching elements and also all the latch receiving

devices are allocated to the longitudinal walls (53). 
Container according to any one or several of the preceding claims,
characterised by an add-on frame (6; 6a) which corresponds substantially to

the contour of the base (2) for the purpose of fixedly receiving a further
container (1), wherein this add-on frame (6;6a) in the folded-flat state of the

structure (5; 5a; 5b) lies outwardly flush on the base frame (4) and engages
behind said base frame inwardly with downwardly protruding holding

brackets (62) and in the erected state lies on the longitudinal walls (53) and
end walls (51) at least outwardly encompassing said walls with the holding

brackets (62).
Container according to claim 11, characterised in that the add-on frame (6;
6a) comprises further, inwardly offset holding brackets (62) which in the

erected state engage inwards behind the structure (5; 5a; 5b).
Container according to claim 11, characterised in that the add-on frame (6;
6a) comprises locking elements (67) which engage in corresponding locking

arrangement receiving devices (58) of the erected structure (5; 5a; 5b).
Container according to claim 13, characterised in that the locking elements
are formed as bolts (68) and are disposed inwardly downwards protruding

at the holding brackets (62).
Container according to claim 11, characterised in that the base frame (4)
comprises on its inner side (42b, 43b) cut-outs (48) which correspond with

holding brackets (62) when the add-on frame (6; 6a) is in place.
Container according to one or several of the preceding claims, characterised
in that the walls (51, 53) adjoining the folding edges of the structure (5; 5a;

5b) are mutually connected in an articulated manner by means of flexible
tapes (50) which are placed in grooves (51c, 53c) of these walls. 
Container according to claim 16, characterised in that the grooves are
provided at both ends with groove covers (52 or 54).
