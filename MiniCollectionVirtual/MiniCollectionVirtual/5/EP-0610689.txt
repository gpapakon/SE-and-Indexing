<ABSTRACT>
A container for electrical or electronic equipment comprising a rigid 
central structure (2) substantially symmetrical with respect to the 

horizontal median plane, intended to receive the component parts of 
the equipment, preferably in the form of at least one printed circuit 

plate and two opposed covers (3, 4), which hook onto the two sides of 
the central structure (2), enclosing it in a sandwich, at least one 

of the said covers (3) being able to be provided with keys (18) for 
closing corresponding contacts underlying the printed circuit plate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a container for electrical or 
electronic equipments, particularly, but not necessarily, equipments 
comprising a keystrip, such as remote controls, calculators, cellular 
telephones, personal computer keyboards etc. Electrical equipment of the above-mentioned type is realized by 
making the relative electronic component parts normally on a printed 
circuit, which is housed in a container and closed with a cover, from 
which the control keys of the equipment protrude. The electrical or electronic equipment thus realized is often housed 
in a further protective outer shell. This technique is rather complicated and expensive, and the results 
it gives are not completely satisfactory. For example, it does not 
guarantee proof against dust, or against liquids, especially in 
correspondence with the keys, if these are foreseen protruding from 
the surface of the cover. DE-U 8 707 728 describes a container for electrical equipments, comprising 
a central body for housing the equipments, and two lateral walls which close the 
central body engaging onto it with snap action means.  
 The aim of the invention is to provide a container for electrical or 
electronic equipments of the above-mentioned type, which is of 
highly innovative conception and will be simple to construct at low  
 
cost, will give excellent proof against the infiltration of dust and 
liquids, and which will incorporate at least one keystrip, if needed. The container according to the invention comprises 
the features of claim 1. Conveniently, the electrical components of the equipment are 
contained on a printed circuit, which is housed in the said rigid 
central structure, made of nylon, PVC, ABS, aluminium or similar 
materials. Advantageously the central structure is perfectly 
symmetrical with respect to the horizontal median plane, in such a 
way as to be able to house, when needed, two printed circuit plates 
in correspondence with its two opposed faces, plates which are held 
by flexible tongues made on the same rigid structure. In the event of the electrical equipment comprising control keys, 
which is the most common case, the keys are made directly on one of 
the two covers, which are preferably made in silicone rubber of 
hardness predetermined according to the requirements of their use. If the central rigid structure contains two opposed printed circuit 
plates, keys can be foreseen on both the covers, which possibly can 
be perfectly identical with each other.

<CLAIMS>
A container for electrical or electronic equipments, 
comprising a substantially rigid central structure (2) having means for 

mounting the component parts of the equipment, and two covers, an 
upper one (3) and a lower one (4), characterized in that said central 

structure (2) consists of a frame with an outer perimetral groove (12) and 
said covers (3, 4) are of substantially elastic material and lock onto the 

said frame, closing it in a sandwich, by the peripheral edges (14) of said 
covers (3, 4) hooking around the central structure in engagement with 

said outer peripheral groove (12). 
A container according to claim 1, wherein such frame is 
rectangular in shape.  

 
A container according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that 
the said central structure (2) is substantially symmetrical with 

respect to a horizontal median plane, and has internal projections 
(8) for the support, on both sides, of a respective printed circuit 

plate containing the said component parts. 
A container according to claim 3, characterized in that 
flexible tongues (9) are foreseen on the opposed side edges of the 

said central structure (2), for allowing the insertion and locking of 
the said printed circuit plates.  

 
A container according to any one of the previous claims, 
characterized in that the said central structure (2) is substantially 

symmetrical with respect to the vertical longitudinal median plane.

characterized in that the said central structure (2) is divided into 

two spaces (6, 7) by an intermediate bulkhead (5), the said spaces 
being intended to receive, respectively, the feeder batteries of the 

equipment and the printed circuit plate or plates, the said structure 
(2) having in addition a window (10) and/or holes (11) for housing an 

electrical connector and LEDs, respectively. 
A container according to any one of the previous claims, 
characterized in that at least one of the said covers (3. 4) has keys 

(18) with underlying electrical contacts (19) for closing 
corresponding contacts of the printed circuit plate. 
A container according to claim 7, characterized in that the 
outer surface of the said keys (18) is concave. 
A container according to any one of the claims from 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the outer surface of the said keys (18) is 

convex.
