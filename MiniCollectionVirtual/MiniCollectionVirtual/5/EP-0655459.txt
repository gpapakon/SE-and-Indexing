<ABSTRACT>
A process for introducing a 1,2 double bond 
into a compound of the formula 


which comprises the process of (a) treating the 
compound of formula I with oxalyl chloride; (b) 

brominating the product of step (a) followed by 
in 
situ
 dehydrobromination; (c) deprotecting the product 
of step (b) to yield the α and β isomers; (d) 

dehydrobrominating the product of step (c), which 
results in the introduction of a double bond at the 

1,2 position.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with a process for preparing crystalline
17β-(N-tert-butylcarbamoyl)-4-aza-5α-androst-1-en-3-one (finasteride), to
crystalline finasteride prepared therefrom, to the crystalline finasteride
thereby prepared for use in treating hyperandrogenic conditions, and to
the use of the crystalline finasteride thereby prepared for the manufacture
of a medicament for treating hyperandrogenic conditions.EP-A-0298652 describes inter alia a method for crystallizing
finasteride from methylene chloride-isopropyl acetate. No other method is
disclosed therein for preparing crystalline finasteride. A dehydrogenation process involving a silylation-mediated DDQ
oxidation of 4-aza-3-ketosteroids to the corresponding Δ1-lactams is
reported in Bhattacharya et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 110, 3318 (1988). This
publication specifically describes the crystallization of the 17β-carboxylic
acid analogue of finasteride from methylene chloride-acetonitrile.
However, there is no explicit disclosure therein of any method for
crystallizing finasteride. The present invention provides a process for preparing crystalline
finasteride which consists of dissolving finasteride to a concentration of
0.216 g/ml in 1 part by volume of acetic acid and slowly adding 10 parts by
volume of water; ageing the mixture at room temperature for 10 hours
with agitation; filtration and drying at 70°C in vacuo.In another aspect, the present invention provides crystalline
finasteride obtainable from the process described above.In a further aspect, the present invention provides crystalline
finasteride obtainable from the process described above for use in treating
hyperandrogenic conditions. The crystalline finasteride obtainable from the process of the
present invention is a testosterone-5α-reductase inhibitor useful for
treating the hyperandrogenic conditions of acne vulgaris, seborrhea,
female hirsutism, androgenic alopecia including male pattern alopecia,
prostatic carcinoma and benign prostatic hypertrophy by topical or
systemic administration.The schematic flow diagram which follows shows a generalized
process for preparing 3-oxo-4-azasteroids having a double bond at the 1,2-position,
including finasteride, which is the end-product wherein R is
NH-tert-butyl and R1 is hydrogen. 
Generally, in the above process both 5α-azaamide and 5α-azamethylester
are suitable in this three-steps one-pot process. Since all
intermediates leading to products such as 2-bromo-5α-azasteroids are
water sensitive, water 
should be vigorously excluded
