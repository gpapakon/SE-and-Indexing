Device for fastening an anti-theft lock body (10) in its 
support (14), the said lock body being, prior to its insertion 

in the support (14), equipped with a control cam (12), the device 
also comprising a member (34) for fastening the body (10) in the 

support (14), the said fastening member consisting of a metal 
blade (34), U-shaped overall, having two parallel arms (36, 36') 

connected by a curved base (38), characterised in that, for an 
angular position of the cam (12) which is different from the 

fastening position of the anti-theft device, the arms (36, 36') 
of the fastening member (34) are able to cooperate successively 

with radial slots (30, 30'; 32, 32') in the support (14), radial 
passages (20, 22) in the casing (10) and recesses (24, 26) in the 

cam (12). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterised in that the arms 
(36, 36') each have a curved recess (42, 42') fitting within a 

diameter (D) equal to the external diameter of the cam (12). 
Device according to either one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the arms (36, 36') have a width (e) equal 

to the width of the passages (20, 22) in the body (10). 
Device according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the arms (36, 36') have, on the side 

opposite to the curved base (30), bevelled ends (44, 44'). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterised in that the curved 
base (38) has a shape complementary to an external wall (40) of 

the support (14). 
Device according to Claim 4, characterised in that the 
support (14) has two radial ribs (48, 48') connecting the slots 

(30, 32) and forming a housing for the curved base (38) of the 
fastening member (34).
