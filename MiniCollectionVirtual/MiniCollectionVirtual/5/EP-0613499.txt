<CLAIMS>
Use of mutant hIL-4 proteins which are antagonists
or partial agonists of hIL-4, and in which one or

more of the amino acids which occur naturally in
the wild type at positions 121, 124 or 125 is/are,

respectively, replaced by (a) different amino
acid(s) of the possible natural amino acids, for

preparing medicaments.
Use according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
, in
the mutant hIL-4 proteins, the amino acid tyrosine

which occurs naturally at position 124 is replaced
by a different amino acid of the possible natural

amino acids.
Use according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that
, at
position 124, tyrosine is replaced by aspartic acid

or by glycine.
Use according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
, in
the mutant hIL-4 proteins, the amino acid arginine

which occurs naturally at position 121 is replaced
by a different amino acid of the possible natural

amino acids.
Use according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that
, at
position 121, arginine is replaced by aspartic acid 

or by glycine.
Mutant hIL-4 proteins, 
characterized in that
 one or
more of the amino acids which occur(s) naturally at

positions 121 or 125, and also facultatively at
position 124, is/are, respectively, replaced by a

different amino acid of the possible natural amino
acids.
Mutant hIL-4 proteins, 
characterized in that
 the
amino acid tyrosine which occurs naturally at

position 124 is replaced by a different amino acid
of the possible natural amino acids, with the

exception of aspartic acid.
Mutant hIL-4 proteins according to Claim 7, 
characterized
in that
 tyrosine is replaced by glycine.
Process for preparing mutant hIL-4 proteins according
to one of Claims 6 to 8, 
characterized in that
cDNA, which encompasses a DNA region which
encodes the mature region of hIL-4, is subjected

to a targeted oligonucleotide mutagenesis (site-directed
mutagenesis) such that a selected

different amino acid of the possible natural
amino acids, is expressed at the desired position(s),
the DNA region which encodes the mutated, mature
region of hIL-4 is inserted into an expression

vector,
the hybrid vector which has been formed is
introduced into E. coli, yeast, or another

eukaryotic cell, and 
the mutant hIL-4 proteins are expressed and,
where appropriate, isolated.
Process according to Claim 9, 
characterized in that

DNA encoding an initiating methionine is incorporated
into the cDNA which encompasses the DNA

region which encodes the mature region of hIL-4
prior to the site-directed mutagenesis being

carried out.
Process according to Claim 9 or 10, 
characterized
in that
 the DNA region which encodes the mutated,
mature region of hIL-4 is excised from the vector

as a NcoI/BamHI fragment.
Process according to one of Claims 9 to 11, 
characterized
in that
 use is made of a temperature-regulated
expression vector, for example pILA502

(without left-hand lambda promoter and polylinker)
and/or of the modified E. coli strain JM103 (recA)

as the host.
