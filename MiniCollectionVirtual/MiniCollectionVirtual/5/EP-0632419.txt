apparatus is a road side apparatus (1) comprising: a first 
alternating current generating section (2) for generating a 

first alternating current; at least one first coil (3) for 
generating the magnetic field by the first alternating current; 

at least one first driving section (7) for detecting change in 
impedance of the first coil and outputting a first drive signal 

on the basis of the detected change in the first coil impedance; 
and a speech generating section (9, 11) for generating speech 

information in response to the outputted first drive signal.

comprising a soft magnetic substance (5) for changing the first 
coil impedance when carried by a walker.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a guide apparatus, and 
more specifically to a guide apparatus such that various 
information can be given to a person carrying a soft magnetic 
substance when he enters a predetermined area. Conventionally, wire broadcasting or radio broadcasting 
has been well known as means for supplying various information 
to a foot passenger or a walker. In the case of the wire 
broadcasting, a plurality of speakers connected to a ground 
station through wires are arranged at predetermined intervals 
along a road, and speech information is given from the ground 
station to walkers via the speakers. Further, in the case of 
the radio broadcasting, a radio transmitter is installed in a 
ground station and a radio receiver is carried by a walker so 
that various information can be given from the station to the 
walker through the receiver where necessary. In the case of the wire broadcasting, although information 
can be supplied simultaneously to a great number of unspecified 
persons over a wide range, this method is not suitable for the 
case where information must be supplied to only a specific 
person, as when a visually handicapped person is guided to a 
place or across a crossing. In addition, since the information 
is inevitably given to all the persons; that is, since the 
information cannot be selected, the given information is a mere 
noise for the persons who do not want the information. 
Therefore, in this method, the information must be limited to 
only the public information, so that there exists such a problem 
in that information cannot be supplied to only a specific person 
who wants the information. In the case of the radio broadcasting, on the other 
hand, since a relatively expensive receiver must be carried by a 
walker independently, there exist some shortcomings from the 
standpoints of the cost and the portability.  With these problems in mind, therefore, it is the primary 
object of the present invention to provide a guide apparatus 
which can supply information to only a person who really wants 
the information at a low cost. To achieve the above-mentioned object, the present 
invention provides a guide apparatus having a first apparatus 
for supplying information to a walker by detecting change in a 
magnetic field generated thereby and a second apparatus for 
exerting an influence upon the magnetic field of the first 
apparatus, characterized in that: the first apparatus is a road
