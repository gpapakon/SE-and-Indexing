<DESCRIPTION>

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
 Epoxides have gained wide acceptance in protective coatings in electrical and structural applications due to their exceptional combination of properties such as toughness, adhesion, chemical resistance, and superior electrical properties.


 Epoxides may be cured by ultraviolet light (UV) or thermally. W cure involves the use of a photoinitiator with the epoxide. When this system is radiated with ultraviolet light, the formulation is cured into a coating. However, many of the epoxides used in these systems   have a    relatively high viscosity. To reduce this viscosity, the systems may be warmed which results in a decrease in viscosity.


 Polyols are often combined with epoxides to improve their properties. When the polyols are of sufficient molecular weight, for example, to improve flexibility of the epoxide coatings, they further increase the viscosity of the formulation. If they are of low molecular weight (such as diethylene glycol, tripropylene glycol, etc.), they may decrease the viscosity of the formulation, but they do not enhance the flexibility and/or toughness of the system and may make it more brittle. In addition, usually only small amounts of such low molecular weight compounds--including alcohols--can be employed or properties of the resultant coating will be deleteriously affected. The low molecular weight alcohols exhibit the most detrimental effect on crosslink density and the coating solvent  resistance and hardness.
The affinity of any given compound for the   other components    will also have an effect on the viscosity reducing power of any given diluent. As the molecular weight is decreased, there often is a concommitant increase in volatility which can result in loss of a given compound during the radiation-cure step or in a subsequent thermal curing operation. Moderate levels of mono-glycidyl compounds such as butyl glycidyl ether, etc., are often used as epoxy diluents but in W curing systems they retard the curing process. Solvents, in general, could be used to reduce viscosity; but they would need to be volatilized at some point in the coating process. However, such volatilization would negate the benefits of radiation curable systems which are considered to be essentially 100 percent solids coating systems.


 What is needed for radiation cure systems is a rapidly curable reactive diluent that will cure into the final product, have a marked effect in lowering viscosity, be of low volatility during the radiation cure operation, and not retard
