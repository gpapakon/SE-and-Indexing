<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a system for electrical connection between a male element and a female element. The male element (10) comprises a body (12) which is terminated by a connection sleeve (14) and a locking ring (32) mounted so as to be able to move translationally. The sleeve comprises a plurality of through-holes (28), each provided with a ball (30). The internal face (34) of the locking ring includes a first (36) annular recess and a second (38) annular recess which are separated by an annular projection (40), and the said locking ring is connected to the connection sleeve by two opposing elastic systems (42, 44).

Electrical connection system comprising a first 
connection element (10) having a body (12) which 

terminates in a connection sleeve (14) and a locking ring 
(32) mounted mobile in translation on the external 

surface of the body and of the sleeve, the said sleeve 
having a plurality of orifices (28) passing through it 

each provided with a ball (30) and a second connection 
element (60) provided with a locking skirt (64) which can 

penetrate the said sleeve, the said skirt being provided 
on its external surface with an annular groove (68) which 

is opposite the said balls when the male and female 
elements are connected, characterised by the fact that 

the internal surface (34) of the locking ring comprises a 
first (36) and a second (38) annular cavity separated by 

an annular projection (40), and by the fact that the said 
locking ring is connected to the connection sleeve by two 

antagonistic elastic systems (42, 44), the said elastic 
systems (42, 44) being arranged between the internal 

surface (34) of the said locking ring and the external 
surface (12a) of the body of the first connection 

element, each elastic system extending between an annular 
fillet (52) integral with one of the parts comprising the 

body of the first connection element and the locking ring 
and a shoulder integral with the other part (48, 50), in 

such a way that in the rest position the said annular 
projection of the locking ring is opposite the said 

balls, as a result of which the said balls (30) project 
inside the said sleeve and that, when one or the other of 

the said elastic systems is compressed, by translation of 
the said ring (32), one or the other of the said annular 

cavities (36, 38) is opposite the said balls, as a result 
of which the balls are released.  

 
Connection system as described in claim 1,
 
characterised by the fact that the first elastic system 

(42) extends between an annular projecting fillet (52) in 
the internal surface of the said ring and a first 

shoulder (50) of the body of the said first connection 
element, and by the fact that the second elastic system 

(44) extends between the said annular fillet and a second 
shoulder (48) of the said body of the said first 

connection element. 
Connection system as described in claim 2,
 
characterised by the fact that the said elastic systems 

are arranged in a part (46) of the body (12) of the first 
connection element (10) having a reduced diameter 

defining the said first shoulder (48) and by the fact 
that the said second shoulder consists of a ring (50) 

integral with the said body. 
Connection system as described in any one of claims 
1 to 3, characterised by the fact that the said elastic 

systems each consist of a helical spring surrounding the 
body (12) of the said first connection element (10). 
Connection system as described in any one of claims 
1 to 4, characterised by the fact that one of the annular 

cavities (36) consists of a hollowed out portion of the 
internal surface of the said locking ring opening into 

the free end (32a) of the said ring.
