<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel method for preparing certain 
3-amino-2-chloro-4-alkylpyridines. In EP-A-0 429 987 are described novel 5,11-dihydro-6H-dipyrido[3,2-b:2',3'-e] 
[1,4] diazepines useful in the 
prevention and treatment of HIV infection and methods for 
preparing these compounds. 3-Amino-2-chloro-4-alkylpyridines are useful intermediates in 
the preparation of 4-alkyl-5,11-dihydro-6H-dipyrido-[3,2-b:2',3'-e]-[1,4]diazepines. In J. Org. Chem. (1960) 25, 560-564 the preparation of 4-methyl-3-pyridine 
carboxaldehyde via 4-methyl-2,6-dichloro-3-cyano-pyridine 
is described. The reaction sequence uses as 
starting steps the condensation of cyanoacetamide and ethyl 
acetoacetate. In Chem. Ber. (1936) 12, 2593-2605 the chlorination of 2-amino-pyridine 
is disclosed using either a reaction mixture 
comprising conc. hydrochloric acid and 15 % hydroperoxide or 
conc. hydrochloric acid together with elemental chlorine. Both 
methods produce besides 3-amino-2-chloro-pyridine as main 
product also the 2,6-dichlorinated by-product. The second 
method produces the main product only in a yield of 22 %.  
 EP-A-0 429 987 discloses inter alia the preparation of 3-amino-2-chloro-4-methyl-pyridine 
via 2-chloro-4-methyl-3-nitro-pyridine. 
For the preparation of the starting compound a 
nitration step is necessary which is undesirable for large 
scale production. EP-A-0 482 481 describes inter alia a process for the 
preparation of 3-amino-2,6-dichloro-4-methyl-pyridine. The aim of the present invention is to provide a low cost and 
environmentally safe process for the preparation of 3-amino-2-chloro-4-alkylpyridines 
in high yields avoiding undesirable 
reaction steps such as nitration and avoiding contamination 
with 2,6-dichloropyridine by-products. This aim has been 
realized as described below. 3-Amino-2-chloro-4-alkylpyridines prepared by the novel 
process of this invention have the formula: 
 
wherein R is alkyl of from one to three carbon atoms. The process for this invention for the preparation of the 
compound of formula I is outlined below:  
 
The novel process of this invention for preparing the 3-amino-2-chloro-4-alkylpyridine 
of formula I comprises the 
following steps: 
Step 1, reacting a compound having the formula: 
 
wherein R and R1 are each alkyl of from one to three carbon 
atoms,  
 
with cyanoacetamide 
 
in the presence of an organic solvent such as methanol or 
ethanol, with a base, such as KOH, at a temperature ranging 
from 50°C to 80°C, for 4 to 8 hours, to produce a compound
