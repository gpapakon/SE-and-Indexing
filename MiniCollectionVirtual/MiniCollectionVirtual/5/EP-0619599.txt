<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a thin film
single crystal substrate which is useful in the production
of a semiconductor. More particularly, it relates to a thin
film single crystal substrate comprising a single crystal
diamond base and at least one film of a single crystal material
formed thereon.Some of materials having a crystalline structure
is useful as materials of electric elements. For example,
silicon carbide has been studied as a material for a heat
and environment resistant element or a light-emitting element
since it has several crystal structures and band gap of
2.2 to 3.3 eV depending on the crystal structure, its heat
conductivity is as large as 4.9 W/cm.K, its maximum electron
mobility is confirmed to be 1,000 cm2/V.sec., and it is
possible to control p-type and n-type valence electrons.The crystal structures of silicon carbide are
roughly classified into an α-type and a β-type. Since silicon
carbide of the α-type hexagonal system (6H) has a large
band gap of about 2.9 eV, it is believed that it can be used
as a material for a blue light-emitting element. Silicon
carbide of the β-type cubic system (3C) has a large electron 
mobility, it is investigated as a material for an environment
resistant element.Since a silicon carbide single crystal has a high
melting point and is chemically stable, it is difficult to
produce a large single crystal with good quality which can
be used as a semiconductive material. Therefore, the single
crystal of silicon carbide is formed by growing it on a
silicon single crystal or sapphire in a gas or liquid phase
(cf. Japanese Patent Kokai Publication Nos. 83588/1978 and
146299/1978).However, the silicon single crystal has various
drawbacks. For example, since it has a band gap of 1.1 eV
which is smaller than that of the silicon carbide single
crystal, it has smaller resistivity at high temperature. It
has a low melting point and a small thermal conductivity of
1.5 W/cm.K). Because of these characteristics of silicon
carbide, when the silicon carbide single crystal is grown on
the silicon single crystal, the advantages of the latter as
the heat resistant semiconductive material are greatly
impaired. Therefore, the silicon carbide single crystal
grown on the silicon single crystal is used by removing the
latter with an acid, but the remaining thin film of the
silicon carbide has a thickness of several ten µm and is
easily cracked or strained, which deteriorates its handling
properties. When the silicon carbide single crystal is used
without removing the
