<ABSTRACT>
A cost-effective fragmentation body (3.6) for fragmentation projectiles having structural fragments (32) between an inner casing (20) and an outer casing (40) exists in a vacuum as a result of explosive forming. This fragmentation body is gas-tight as a result of welding of the inner casing (20) and the outer casing (40) in regions (29, 47, 41). The structural fragments (32) are arranged uniformly distributed between the inner casing (20) and the outer casing (40) so that the internal and external ballistics of a fragmentation projectile which is provided with such a fragmentation body (3.6) is not subject to any disturbance resulting from an unbalance or cracks in the outer casing (40).

<CLAIMS>
Method of manufacturing a fragmentation body, in which 
at least a single layer of structural fragments (32) is 

pressed in between two cases (20,40), arranged 
concentrically one inside the other, this method having 

the following procedural stages: 

Inserting the structural fragments (32) in a channel 
(25) of an inner case (20); 
Pushing an outer case (40) onto the inner case (20); 
Centring the forming object (3) comprising inner 
and outer cases (20,40) and structural fragments (32) 

in a base plate (1); 
Placing a cap (5) provided with a conical outer face 
(14) on the forming object (3) for guiding the 

detonation waves, this cap (5) gripping the outer case 
(40) by means of a rim (6); 
Fixing a covering tube (4) to the base plate (1), so 
that there is a space (10) in radial direction between 

this covering tube (4) and the outer case (40) and the 
covering tube (4) has an axial excess length (11) in 

relation to the cap (5), the excess length (11) being 
approximately one third of the space (10); 
Arranging these specified components vertically in a 
vacuum-resistant container (13) on a support (12); 
Inserting explosive substance (9) into the space 
between the covering tube (4) and the outer case (40), 

whilst this covering tube (4) and the outer case (40) 
are, as mentioned above, arranged in a vertical position 

on the support (12), the explosive substance (9) 
extending axially over a level end face of the cap (5) 

over the excess length (11) and the radial distance (10) 
defining the layer of explosive substance (9) on the 

circumferential side; 
Evacuating the container (13);  
 
Igniting a detonator (7), located concentrically on the 
cap (5), whereby, by means of this explosive forming 

taking place from outside, the structural fragments in 
the inner case (20) and the outer case (40) can be 

formed with prefragmenting of the still intact inner and 
outer cases (20,40); 
Ventilating the container (13) with removal of the 
fragmentation body for the shape-cutting process. 
Method according to Claim 1,
 
characterized in that
 
the inner case (20) can be radially supported from the 

inside by a removable spike (22). 
Method according to Claim 1,
 
characterized in that
 
the structural fragments are held in a spacing grid (35) 

with compressible bars (35.1). 
Method according to Claim 1,
 
characterized in that
 
the inner and outer cases (20,40) have sections (29,47) 

which can be welded together outside a channel (25) for 
the structural fragments (32). 
Method according to Claim 1,
 
characterized in that
 
the inner and outer cases (20,40) are made of a carbon-containing 

steel or a stainless steel and the structural 
fragments are made of a heavy metal or steel. 
Method according to Claim 1,
 
characterized in that
 
the structural fragments (32) lie in the channel (25) of 

the inner case (20) which is graduated by different outer 
diameters (27,28) and a taper (26). 
 
 
Method according to Claim 1,
 
characterized in that
 
the cap (5) used in this method is made of a shock-absorbing 

material. 
Method according to Claim 1,
 
characterized in that
 
a head (18) on the detonating side of the inner case (20), 

for sealing off the intermediate space (annular opening 
42-46) against the detonating products of the explosive 

substance, has a band (23) which lies adjacent to the 
inlet area of the outer case (40).
