<ABSTRACT>
A method of manufacturing a cold-rolled can steel sheet 
having less planar anisotropy and achieving good 

workability. Rough-rolling is first performed on a 
continuously-cast slab. The slab has a composition 

essentially consisting of: C: 0.004wt% or lower; Mn: 0.05 
- 0.5wt%; P: 0.02wt% or lower; Al: 0.005 - 0.07wt%; N: 

0.004wt% or lower; and Nb: 0.001 - 0.018wt%, the rest 
being Fe and unavoidable impurities. A resultant sheet 

bar is then subjected to hot rolling which is completed 
at a finishing rolling temperature at an Ar₃ 

transformation point or higher. The resultant sheet bar 
is coiled at a temperature range from 450 - 700°C. 

Subsequently, the resultant sheet bar undergoes primary 
cold rolling before continuous annealing, which is 

performed at a recrystallization temperature or higher, 
and secondary cold rolling. The primary and secondary 

cold rolling are respectively performed at reduction 
ratios satisfying the following conditions of:



88% ≦ CR₁%+0.36xCR₂ ≦ 105%

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
manufacturing a can steel sheet used for a tinplate, tin-free
steel, and the like. More particularly, the
invention relates to a method of manufacturing a can
steel sheet which has good ironing workability and has a
small amount of earing produced during working.Conventionally, there are two types of methods for
manufacturing a sheet of a cold-rolled steel sheet to be
used for a tinplate, a tin-free steel sheet, or the like.
a. In one method, acid pickling and cold rolling are
performed after hot rolling, being then followed by
recrystallization annealing. Subsequently, the resultant
sheet is finished by performing temper-rolling at a low
reduction pressure of 3% or lower.b. In the other method, recrystallization annealing
is performed after primary cold rolling. Then, the
original sheet is finished by performing secondary cold
rolling at a high reduction ratio of 50% or lower.The materials obtained by these methods are
generally referred to as DR (Double Reduce) materials. The resultant cold-rolled can steel sheets are
further worked into food or beverage cans, which can be
generally divided into two-piece cans and three-piece
cans according to the working process employed.Two-piece cans have good properties as cans, and can
be manufactured with high efficiency. This has developed
an increase in the adoption of working processes by which
two-piece cans are manufactured.However, two-piece cans, such as DI cans (Drawn and
Ironed cans), DTR cans (Draw and Thin Redrawn cans), and
the like, present a problem in that an increase in the
amount of earing produced may lead to a yield reduction.
In particular, for DI cans, troubles due to the breaking
of earing, or the like, during can making, significantly
lowers production efficiency. Accordingly, there is a
demand for steel sheets which produce a small amount of
earing during working. Also, along with the gaugedown
(downsizing) of the steel sheets with a view to achieving
a cost reduction, there has developed an increase in the
demand for even better deep drawing characteristics than
before. Deep drawing characteristics are evaluated by
the Lankford value (r value). The greater the average r
value, the better the deep drawing characteristics, and
the closer the planar anisotropy (Δr) of the r value
approaches 0, the smaller the amount of earing produced.
Two-piece can steel sheets which possess the above-mentioned 
features have good characteristics for the
intended use.The steel sheets and steel coils for use in
