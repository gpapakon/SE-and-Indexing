<ABSTRACT>
A method of producing a low iron loss grain oriented 
silicon steel sheet which generates improved 

magnetostrictive characteristics when used as a stacked 
iron core and low noise when used in a stacked 

transformer, as well as superior shape characteristics. 
A grain oriented finish-annealed silicon steel sheet is 

coated with an insulating film. The surface of the grain 
oriented silicon steel sheet is irradiated with an 

electron beam along a multiplicity of spaced paths so as 
to refine the magnetic domains. The irradiation with the 

electron beam is conducted continuously or intermittently 
along a wave-form path on the surface of the grain 

oriented silicon steel, and the wave-form, such as a 
zigzag form, has a period length much smaller than the 

width of the grain oriented silicon steel sheet, and line 
interconnecting the centers of successive waves extends 

substantially perpendicularly to the direction of rolling 
of the grain oriented silicon steel sheet.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of producing, by employing electron
beam irradiation, a low iron loss grain oriented silicon steel sheet having
the features contained in the preamble portion of claim 1. Such a method
is known from EP 367 467.Grain oriented silicon steel sheets are used mainly
as the core materials of electrical components such as
transformers or the like. In general, grain oriented
silicon steel sheets are required to have such magnetic
characteristics that the magnetic flux density
(represented by B8) is high and that the iron loss
(represented by W17/50) is low. It is also required that
the surfaces of the steel sheet have insulating films
with excellent surfaces.The energy crisis that the world now faces requires
reduction of losses of electrical power. This has given
rise to a strong demand for grain oriented silicon steel
sheets having reduced iron loss. Grain oriented silicon steel sheets have undergone
various treatments for improving magnetic
characteristics. For instance, treatment has been
conducted to attain a high degree of concentration of the
secondary recrystallization grains in the Goss
orientation. It has also been attempted to form, on a
forsterite film formed on the surface of the steel sheet,
an insulating film having a small thermal expansion
coefficient so as to impart a tensile force to the steel
sheet. Thus, grain oriented silicon steel sheets have
been produced through complicated and diversified
processes which require very strict controls.Among these treatments, one major technique for
reducing iron loss of grain oriented steel sheet has been
the improvement of the aggregation structure of Goss
orientation secondary recrystallization grains.Hitherto, as a method for controlling the secondary
recrystallization grains, preferential growth of Goss
orientation secondary recrystallization grains has been
obtained by using primary recrystallization grain growth
inhibiting agents such as AlN, MnS and MnSe, known as
"inhibitors".In recent years various techniques other than
metallurgical measures have been developed for 
controlling secondary recrystallization grains for
reducing iron loss. For instance, techniques for
reducing iron loss by irradiation with laser beams have
been proposed in IRON AND STEELS, by Tadashi Ichiyama

No. 58-26406. Methods also have been proposed which
employ plasma
