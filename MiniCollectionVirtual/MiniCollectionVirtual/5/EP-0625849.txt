<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a device for adjusting a video signal so that its black level coincides with a predetermined reference level (Vref), comprising a capacitor (C) a first terminal of which receives the video signal (CVBSi) and the second terminal of which (A) supplies the adjusted video signal (CVBSo), and means for discharging the capacitor at a constant current (I) when the adjusted video signal exceeds the reference level and for charging the capacitor at a constant current (8I) when the adjusted video signal is below the reference level, the ratio of the charge and discharge currents lying between 4.3 and 12.6. According to the invention, the device comprises means for significantly reducing the said ratio of currents at least during a part of a frame synchronisation pulse train (Sf).

A device for adjusting a video signal so that
its black level is in coincidence with a predetermined

reference level (Vref), including a capacitor (C) having a
first terminal that receives the video signal (CVBSi) and a

second terminal (A) that provides the adjusted video signal
(CVBSo), and means (10K), for discharging the capacitor (C)

at a constant current (I) when the adjusted video signal
exceeds the reference level, and for charging said capacitor

at a constant current (8I) when the adjusted video
signal is below the reference level, the ratio between the

charging and discharging currents ranging from 4.3 to 12.6,
characterized in that it comprises means (K2) for significantly

reducing said current ratio at least during a
portion of a frame synchronization pulse train (Sf).
The device of claim 1, wherein said means
decrease the current ratio below 1/13 during the occurrence

of a frame synchronization pulse train (Sf).
The device of claim 1, including a charging
current source (8I) connecting the second terminal (A) of

capacitor (C) to a high potential (Vcc), a discharging
current source (I) connecting the second terminal (A) of

capacitor (C) to a low potential, and a comparator (10)
controlling the charging current source and receiving the

signal at the second terminal (A) of said capacitor (C) and
a reference voltage (Vref).
The device of claim 2, including an additional
current source (6.5I) that is connected in parallel with

the discharging current source (I), controlled by an active
signal (Fs) during the occurrence of a frame synchronization

pulse train, the current of said additional source
being approximately equal to the current provided by the

charging current source.
