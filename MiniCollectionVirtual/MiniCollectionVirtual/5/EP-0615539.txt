<DESCRIPTION>
THIS invention relates to drilling muds also known as 
drilling fluids. Drilling muds are used in the sinking of boreholes, 
especially deep-level boreholes sunk in the search for 
hydrocarbons [including gas], to lubricate the drill 
pipe and act as a carrier for excavated drill 
cuttings. The drilling fluid or mud is pumped down the 
drill pipe, through nozzles in the drill bit at the 
bottom of the borehole and up the annulus between the 
drill pipe and borehole wall. Drilled cuttings 
generated by the drill bit are taken up by the mud and 
transported to the surface of the borehole where they 
are separated from the drilling mud and discarded. The 
drilling mud may be cleaned and re-used. The drill 
pipe is thus able to operate freely within the borehole. 
Drilling muds commonly incorporate bentonite 
which is made up as a hydro colloid base for water 
soluble polymers. Apart from its function as a carrier for the cuttings, 
however, a drilling mud operates, interalia, to 
lubricate the drill pipe and bit as well as the wall of 
the borehole thereby reducing torque, overpull and 
wear as well as sticking of the drill pipe in the 
borehole especially in highly deviated wells; it 
provides a hydrostatic balance with the geological 
structure being drilled thereby minimising the  
 
possibility of cave-in of the borehole wall and to keep 
high pressure hydrocarbons from entering the well. 
before a casing is run; and it forms an impermeable 
membrane on the borehole wall which operates to prevent 
the liquid phase in the drilling fluid from migrating 
to the geological formation, causing clays and shales 
to swell. In addition, the drilling mud acts to cool 
the drill bit and other high-pressure wear areas and it 
should also possess a suitable viscosity so as to 
suspend the drill cuttings when the drilling mud pumps 
are stopped. To enhance these functions the drilling 
mud may incorporate additives such as hydrocarbon oil 
lubricants and polymers for controlling flow 
characteristics of the drilling mud. A satisfactory drilling mud should preferably, however, 
also be non-toxic, both to man and the environment. 
With boreholes sunk on dry land it is possible to 
minimise the pollution effects of drilling muds which 
contain moderately toxic components such as hydrocarbon 
additives. However, when the search for oil is 
extended to the sea bed the problem is intensely 
magnified, aquatic life being highly susceptible to 
hydrocarbon contamination even at low concentrations. Traditionally the
