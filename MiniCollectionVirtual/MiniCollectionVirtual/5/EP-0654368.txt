<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hydro-pneumatic 
suspension for uniforming a leveling control for 
controlling a height of a vehicle at left and right 
wheels provided with a self-leveling absorber for 
controlling the level thereof by a pump operation due to 
self contraction and expansion. As shown in Fig. 11, a prior art hydro-pneumatic 
suspension comprises an absorber A for an actuating 
chamber H by intervening with a piston P and a piston 
rod R for forming an orifice O in a cylinder C every 
left and right wheels of a vehicle; a gas spring G 
comprising a gas chamber K and a liquid chamber F 
divided by a diaphragm D; and a self-leveling absorber 
having a leveling control mechanism B comprising a pump 
M for carrying out a pump operation by making use of a 
leveling change of the vehicle, a control opening L for 
determining an aimed leveling thereof and a reservoir S 
for holding a liquid and the suspension controlled the  
 
leveling of the vehicle with respect to the left and 
right wheels independently from each other. Since the hydro-pneumatic suspension of the prior 
art described above controls the leveling of the vehicle 
with respect to the left and right wheels independently 
from each other by the leveling control mechanism B and 
others, there was the disadvantage that in the case that 
there is any difference in the road conditions of the 
left and right wheels, a difference in pump operation is 
produced between the pumps described above and a 
difference in controlling time of leveling is generated, 
resulting in inclination of the vehicle and decreasing 
the running stability thereof. It is a general object of this invention to prevent 
the generation of any difference in the controlling time 
of leveling in left and right wheels and to avoid the 
inclination of vehicles and the decreasing of the 
running stability thereof. It is a more specific object of the invention to 
provide a hydro-pneumatic suspension based on a 
technical idea of the invention to provide at least one 
of the components of pumps, gas springs, control 
openings and reservoirs composed of a leveling control 
mechanisms respectively provided at left and right  
 
wheels as a common one component so as to uniformly 
control the leveling with respect to the left and right 
wheels. It is another object of the invention to provide a 
hydro-pneumatic suspension comprising cylinders engaged 
with at least one of a vehicle body or wheels; piston 
rods provided with a piston having an orifice inserted 
into the
