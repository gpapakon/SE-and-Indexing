<ABSTRACT>
The subject-matter of the invention is a static tripartite seal. The prior art comprises a static seal with a radially preloaded elastomeric O ring or square-section ring which rests against an axial end face of an annular installation space. The disadvantage of this single-part static seal with a single O ring is, apart from the special case of vacuum sealing, the space-filling factor of less than 1 which results in an excessively high leakage rate from gas migration and change in the ring volume (swelling) given tolerances and surface roughness, which must be made smaller than is desirable; another disadvantage being the risk of explosive decompression of the ring material. The object of the invention is to improve the vacuum seal and extend its applications by means of a high space-filling factor to give an easily installed seal for finite pressure differences. The solution to this object is to combine the sealing ring (12; 12') with a stressing element (16; 16') in the axially extended installation space (8; 8') to increase its axial preload and with a rigid, axially movable pressure ring (14; 14') arranged between them.   The advantages of this solution to the object are a reduction in the leakage rate and the change in volume, the widening of the tolerances and permissible roughness range and the avoidance of explosive decompression.
