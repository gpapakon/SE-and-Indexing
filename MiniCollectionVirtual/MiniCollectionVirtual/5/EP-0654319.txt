<ABSTRACT>
A process to avoid or limit corrosion at the junction 
of two piping comprising devices welded together, said 

piping comprising devices being adapted to flow corrosive 
gases through them, said process comprising the steps of: 


a) providing a first piping comprising device 
and connecting it to an inert gas source; 
b) purging it with an inert gas comprising substantially 
not more than 10 ppb of an oxidizing gas selected 

from the group consisting of oxygen, carbon dioxide, water 
vapor or mixtures thereof, said inert gas flowing from a 

first opening to a second opening of said piping comprising 
device; 
c) providing a second pipe comprising device in 
flow communication with the first one, while continuing to 

purge the first piping comprising device; 
d) welding the two piping comprising devices, 
said welding being carried out under an inert gas atmosphere; 

and 
e) repeating steps c and d if necessary.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for assembling
piping and/or components by welding such as Tungsten Inert
Gas (T.I.G.) welding or laser welding, in order to provide a
corrosion-free distribution of ultra-high purity corrosive
gases which are used, for example, in the manufacture of
electronic components or in other industries.In the manufacture of electronic components such as
integrated circuits, corrosive gases are used (pure or
mixtures) to carry out various operations, particularly the
various etching steps. These gases need to be very pure,
i.e., their particulate and gaseous contaminants should be
as low as possible. These gases are usually flowing from a
cylinder located remotely from the point of use through a
piping network installed throughout the plant from said gas
cabinet to the point of use. To make this piping system, it
is necessary to use several individual pipings and various
components such as valves, fittings, filters, pressure
regulators or the like which are usually welded together.
It is known that 316L stainless steel electropolished
tubings are corrosion resistant; however welding of these
tubings together or with other various components induce
localized areas sensitive to corrosion. These areas are of
concern regarding both safety and micro contamination
aspects. Particularly, it is believed that those localized
areas sensitive to corrosion might be a source of micro
contamination of the gases flowing through these tubings. A
distribution system of gases for semiconductor manufacture
is disclosed in the article entitled "HCl Gas Distribution
System: The Effect of Surface Finish and Point of Use
Purification", R. Diguid et al., July 1993, Solid State
Technology, pp. 79-85. Also, the Orbital Tungsten Inert Gas
welding process is disclosed in the article entitled 
"Orbital TIG Welding of Electropolished High Alloy Steel
Tubes" by Herbert Geil; Stainless Steel Europe, May 1992.This article describes inert gas purging and backing of
stainless steel piping means being in flow communication.Corrosion resistance of a stainless steel surface is
known (from H. H. Uhlig & R. W. Review, "Corrosion and
Corrosion Control", by John Wiley & sons, 3rd Edition, 1985)
to be related to the surface enrichment in chromium oxide
while on the contrary the presence of superficial iron oxide
would have a detrimental effect on corrosion resistance.The welding bead area is known to be the corrosion
sensitive point of a welded assembly of stainless steel
parts. The experiments conducted by the
