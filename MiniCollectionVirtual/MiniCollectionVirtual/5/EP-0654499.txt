<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a pneumatic rubber tire 
having a rubber tread of a specified rubber 
composition. Pneumatic rubber tires are conventionally 
prepared with a rubber tread. Such tread is often 
composed of a blend of rubbers. In one aspect, it may be desired for the rubber 
composite for the tread to be designed to enhance 
properties such as treadwear of the tire without 
unduly sacrificing the tire's traction (skid 
resistance). Such often desirable aspect is usually 
difficult to obtain with a single tread rubber 
compound. Thus, in one aspect, it is desired to enhance a 
tire's treadwear while maintaining, or substantially 
maintaining, its wet skid property. In another aspect, the rubber composite for the 
tread, particularly for truck tires, may be desirably 
designed for good treadwear for longevity of the tire, 
for a cooler running temperature of the tire in its 
tread region, also for enhancing the longevity of the 
tire and for reduced groove cracking, also for 
enhancing the longevity of the tire. Truck tires are normally expected to endure 
heavier loads than passenger tires. Truck tires, 
under their heavier loads, may run hotter than 
passenger tires. Such higher running temperatures are typically an 
evidence of greater heat being generated within the 
tire and also reflective of the efficiency of the 
rubber, in the tread region for instance, in  
 
dissipating the heat. Heat generated in a tire, as 
evidenced by a higher running temperature, 
particularly under load, is recognized as a factor 
which ages a tire because of compound reversion and 
degradation. Thus, a truck tire with lower running 
temperature is desirable. Thus, in another aspect, it is some times 
desirable to reduce or at least maintain the rib tear 
characteristic of the truck tire while reducing its 
groove cracking and running temperature. Pneumatic rubber tires have been manufactured 
with treads composed of butadiene/styrene copolymer 
(SBR), natural rubber and cis 1,4-polybutadiene rubber 
for various purposes where the butadiene/styrene 
rubber contained about 20-25 percent styrene and tires 
having treads of SBR having a styrene content of 30-35 
percent and cis 1,4-polyisoprene rubber have been 
disclosed. For example, such tread might be composed 
of, based on 100 parts by weight of the rubber 
component, about 50 parts butadiene/styrene copolymer 
(SBR) containing about 20-25 percent styrene, about 25 
parts natural cis 1,4-polyisoprene and about 25 parts 
cis 1,4-polybutadiene. While it is
