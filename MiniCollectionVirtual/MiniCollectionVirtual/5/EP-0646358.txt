<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an instrument for laparoscopy. 
Laparoscopy greatly reduces surgical trauma in a number of 
different surgical operations. For access to e.g. the heart for e.g. implantation of 
stimulation electrodes or other treatments in, on and around 
the heart, the heart must be exposed by thoracotomy. This 
constitutes major surgery for a patient with heart disease and 
is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Laparoscopic technics, i.e. thoracoscopic methods, have come 
into use in recent years for minor thorax surgery. One example 
of such prior art laparoscopy in the implantation of 
defibrillation electrodes is illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2. A number of introducer tools 2, 4, 6, 8, i.e. trocars, are 
advanced to the pericardium through channels established in 
the patient. Surgical instruments, such as different gripping 
tools 10, 12, optical instruments 14 and implants in the form 
of electrodes 18, 20 with attendant leads, are then introduced 
through these trocars 2, 4, 6 8. The optical instrument 14, a thoracoscope, is advanced through 
the pericardium, and the thoracoscope generates an image on a 
TV monitor (see FIG. 2) so the surface of the heart can be 
inspected. The electrodes 18 are pacing electrodes, whereas the electrode 
20 is a so-called patch electrode.  The object of the present invention is to further simplify 
present-day laparoscopy and make it even less traumatic to 
patients. This object is achieved with an instrument according to claim 
1. With the instrument according to the invention, a plurality of 
instruments and possibly even an implant can be introduced 
through one and the same introducer tool which only requires a 
single channel for introduction into the patient. The result 
is shorter hospitalization and care times and a reduced risk 
of complications, such as puncture of the pleura and damage to 
the phrenic nerve during thorax surgery. The instrument also 
provides better access for inspection and manipulation, and 
implantation of e.g. cardiac stimulation electrodes is as 
simple as in transvenous implantation. According to one advantageous embodiment of the instrument 
according to the invention, the introducer tool is devised 
with a central channel for the introduction of an optical 
instrument and additional, lateral channels for the 
introduction of other surgical equipment. This thereby offers 
the surgeon a good view for inspecting and monitoring the area 
of interest of the organ in question. According to another advantageous

<CLAIMS>
An instrument for laparoscopy, characterized in that an 
introducer tool (1) is devised for introduction and positional 

fixation of surgical equipment in the form of at least two 
surgical tools, optical instruments, implants or the like. 
An instrument of claim 1, characterized in that the 
introducer tool (1) is devised with a channel for the 

introduction of an optical instrument and additional channels 
for the introduction of other surgical equipment. 
An instrument of claim 1, characterized in that the 
introducer tool comprises a hollow body with a console (3) or 

plate arranged at the entrance end of the introducer tool (1), 
said console or plate being devised with holes to hold 

surgical equipment and optical instruments. 
An instrument of any of claims 1 to 5, characteized in 
that the introducer tool (1) is funnel-shaped. 
An instrument of claims 2 and 4, characterized in that 
the lateral channels are at an angle to the central channel. 
An instrument of claim 1, characterized in that the 
introducer tool comprises a hollow body at whose entrance a 

plurality of hollow, appropriately directed guide cavities are 
arranged through which surgical tools, optical instruments and 

the like can be introduced and guided in the desired 
introduction direction. 
An instrument of any of claims 1 - 6, characterized in 
 

that the end of the introducer tool (1) intended for 
introduction into the body has a soft bearing collar (5). 
An instrument of any of claims 1 - 7, characterized in 
that an adjustable spacer sleeve (26) adjustable on the 

exterior of the introducer tool (1) is arranged to determine 
the working distance of the introducer tool. 
An instrument of any of claims 1 - 8, characterized in 
that the introducer tool (1) has a round cross-section. 
An instrument of any of claims 1 - 8, characterized in 
that the introducer tool (1) has an oval cross-section. 
An instrument of any of claims 1, 3 or 7 - 10, 
characterized in that a mandrel is introducible into the 

interior of the introducer tool to close off its leading end 
and expand the opening in the tissue to the heart or some 

other organ as the introducer tool is advanced into the 
patient's body, and thereafter is removed from the introducer 

tool. 
An instrument of claim 11, characterized in that the 
mandrel comprises a sealing body, attached to a rod for 

inserting the mandrel into and removing the mandrel from the 
introducer tool, said sealing body being adapted to the 

leading end section of the introducer tool.
