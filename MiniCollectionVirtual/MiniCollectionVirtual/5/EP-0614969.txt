<CLAIMS>
A process for replicating viruses of the HIV type
which cause immune deficiency, wherein the viruses

are replicated with the aid of lymphocytes which have
been transformed with herpesvirus saimiri.
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the human
lymphocytes are transformed with herpesvirus saimiri,

with herpesviruses of Group C or of Group Non A - Non
B.
The process as claimed in one of the preceding
claims, wherein the lymphocytes are CD-4-positive.
The process as claimed in one of the preceding
claims, wherein the human lymphocytes originate from

thymus, peripheral blood, umbilical cord blood, lymph
nodes, lymph vessels, spleen or bone marrow.
The process as claimed in one of claims 1 to 4,
wherein the viruses of the HIV type which cause

immune deficiency are those which originate from
asymptomatic, seropositive patients.
The process as claimed in one of the preceding
claims, wherein lymphocytes transformed with

herpesvirus saimiri are co-cultivated with other
cells. 
The use of the lymphocytes transformed with
herpesvirus saimiri, which lymphocytes are employed

in a process as claimed in one of claims 1 to 6, for
replicating viruses of the HIV type which cause

immune deficiency.
