<ABSTRACT>
A conveyor for feeding out or feeding in goods within an elongated area comprises a tower (1) movable along a path located at a long side of the elongated area, an arm (4, 5) mounted on the tower and having a free end (6) extending into the area, and a feed-out device or a feed-in device (7) mounted at the free end of the arm. The conveyor further comprises an endless conveyor belt (10) which is closed but can be opened for feeding out or feeding in the goods. Belt-guiding means (11-13, 16, 19) guide the conveyor belt from a first terminal point of the path, along this up to the tower, up along the tower and out along the arm to the feed-out device or the feed-in device, back along the arm and the tower down to the path, further along this to the second terminal point, and in a return path back to the first terminal point. A feed-in or feed-out station (20, 21) is provided at one of the terminal points or at a point along the return path.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a conveyor for feeding 
out or feeding in goods within an elongated area, said 
conveyor comprising a tower movable along a path located 
at a long side of the elongated area, an arm mounted on 
the tower and having a free end which extends into said 
area, and a feed-out device or a feed-in device mounted 
at the free end of the arm such a system is known, for example, from US-A-4 732 523. Conveyors of this type are, among other things, used 
for loading and unloading ships moored alongside the quay, 
in which case the elongated area is the ship's hold. Such 
conveyors are also used for conveying coal to and from 
coal depots, in which case the depot, of course, is the 
elongated area. In both instances, use is commonly made of 
a first conveyor for conveying the goods along a long side 
of the area, e.g. the quay, and from the first conveyor 
the goods is reloaded to a second conveyor which transports 
it up through the tower and out to the feed-out 
device located at the free end of arm. The reloading site 
then has to move together with the tower, which is difficult 
and involves the risk of dusting. The object of the present invention is to obviate 
the inconveniences of reloading when conveying goods as 
described above. According to the invention, this object is achieved 
by a conveyor which is of the above type and which is 
characterised by a single endless conveyor belt which is 
closed but can be opened for feeding out or feeding in the 
goods, belt-guiding means for guiding the conveyor belt 
from a first terminal point of the path, along this and up 
to the tower, up along the tower and out along the arm to 
the feed-out device or the feed-in device, back along the 
arm and the tower down to the path, further along this to 
the second terminal point thereof, and in a return path 
back to the first terminal point, and a feed-in or feed-out  
 
station arranged at one of the terminal points or at 
a point along the return path. According to the invention, use is thus made of a 
single conveying belt operating along a long side of the 
area, thence along the tower and the arm to, and from, the 
free end of the arm. The reloading hitherto required has 
thus been completely eliminated. When the tower is moved along the path, the belt on 
one side of the tower is thus lifted into the tower, while 
the belt on the other side of the tower is laid out from 
the tower. To perform this in the simplest possible manner, 
the belt-guiding means disposed along the path

<CLAIMS>
A conveyor for feeding out or feeding in goods 
within an elongated area, said conveyor comprising 


a tower (1) movable along a path located at a long 
side of the elongated area, 
an arm (4, 5) mounted on the tower and having a free 
end (6) which extends into said area, and 
a feed-out device (8) or a feed-in device (7) mounted 
at the free end of the arm, 
 
   
characterised by
 comprising 

only one endless conveyor belt (10) which is closed 
but can be opened for feeding out or feeding in the goods, 
belt-guiding means (11-16, 19, 22) for guiding the 
conveyor belt from a first terminal point of the path, 

along this and up to the tower (1), up along the tower and 
out along the arm (4, 5) to the feed-out device (8) or the 

feed-in device (7), back along the arm and the tower down 
to the path, further along this to the second terminal 

point thereof, and in a return path back to the first terminal 
point, and 
a feed-in or feed-out station (20, 21) arranged at 
one of the terminal points or at a point along the return 

path. 
A conveyor as set forth in claim 1, 
characterised
 in that the belt-guiding means (11-16, 19, 
22) disposed along the path between the terminal points 

thereof only comprise supporting rollers arranged beneath 
the conveyor belt. 
A conveyor as set forth in claim 1 or 2, 

characterised
 in that the conveyor belt (10) 
is driven by a terminal roller (11, 19) at one or both of 

the terminal points of the path. 
A conveyor as set forth in claim 3, 
characterised
 in that the belt-guiding means (11-16, 19, 
22) comprise a driven belt (22) which is in frictional  

 
contact with the closed conveyor belt (10) in the area 

where this changes from moving up to the tower (1) to moving 
up along the tower. 
A conveyor as set forth in claim 3 or 4, 

characterised
 by adjusting means for minimising 
tractive forces in the conveyor belt (10) by varying 

the distribution of the driving forces applied, at least 
according to the position of the tower (1) along the path. 
A conveyor as set forth in any one of claims 1-5, 

characterised
 in that the belt (10) comprises 
a planar central part and two planar edge parts which are 

each hingedly connected to the central part via a hinge 
part, the central part and the edge parts being flexurally 

rigid about the longitudinal direction of the belt, and 
the total width of the edge parts being larger, and the 

width of the hinge parts being substantially smaller, than 
the width of the central part. 
A conveyor as set forth in claim 6, 
characterised
 by a longitudinal strip which is fixedly 
connected to one side of the central part and projects 

upwards therefrom and which is located in the overlapping 
area of the edge parts, and, optionally, driver strips 

which are fixedly connected to the central part and the 
longitudinal strip and which extend from the longitudinal 

strip at least to a lateral edge of the central part. 
A conveyor as set forth in claim 6 or 7, 

characterised
 in that one edge part of the 
conveyor belt (10) is divided into two sections closest 

to its free longitudinal edge so as to form a longitudinal 
pocket which is open towards the free longitudinal edge 

and in which the free edge portion of the other edge part 
is received substantially non-rotatably and positively 

retained owing to the connection between the edge parts 
and the central part. 
A conveyor as set forth in any one of claims 1-8, 

characterised
 in that an upper part (3) of 
the tower (1) is rotatable about a vertical axis.  

 
A conveyor as set forth in any one of claims 1-9, 

characterised
 in that the arm (4, 5) is
