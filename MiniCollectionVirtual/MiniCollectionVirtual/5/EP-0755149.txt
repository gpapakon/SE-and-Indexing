<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for digitizing ccd-data, in which a 
A/D-converter (14) is controlled such that the analog data are evaluated at the 

correct timings. Instead of delaying one of the clock signals (PHI; CONV), it is 
proposed to delay the analog data (V
ccd
) in a filter (20) which serves as an analog 
delay circuit. This makes it possible to adjust the delay time more easily and more 

accurately and reliably.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method and a system for digitizing analog data.
More particularly, the invention relates to a method and system for digitizing data
that have been generated by an image sensor including a charge coupled device
(ccd), a MOS-imager which is also known as a "charge injection device", and the
like.Charge coupled devices usually comprise a large number of light sensitive
cells which generate and hold electric charges in response to light incident
thereupon. The charges accumulated in each cell during a certain integration time
are then transferred to one or more outputs of the ccd and are converted into
electric voltages under the control of and in synchronism with a clock signal.The analog data obtained in this way at the output of the ccd are supplied to
an A/D-converter (ADC) via a conditioning circuit in which the offset and the gain
factor are adapted to the input characteristics of the ADC.A block diagram of a conventional ccd system of this type is illustrated in Fig.
3A. A ccd-array 10 supplies CCD-data Vccd to the conditioning circuit 12 the output of
which is connected to the data input of ADC 14. In this example, the ccd-array is of
a type which is controlled by a clock signal PHI, the inverted clock signal PHIn and
a reset signal RS.The waveforms of the signals Vccd, PHI and RS are shown in Fig. 3B. The
signals PHI and PHIn serve as transport clock pulses by which the charges
accumulated in the ccd cells are shifted through analog shift registers to the output
port of the ccd-array which operates as a charge/voltage converter. The signal RS
provides reset pulses for this charge/voltage converter. When the converter has
been reset in the "low" period of the signal RS, the output port assumes a voltage
Vos which corresponds to a ccd cell which has not been exposed to light. At the
subsequent transition of the signals PHI and PHIn the next charge quantity is
transferred to the output port and converted into a voltage Vout which represents the
amount of light that has been received by the corresponding ccd cell. This voltage
Vout has to be converted into digital data by the ADC 14. Accordingly, the ADC has
to be controlled by an appropriate converter clock signal CONV in such a manner
that the voltage of the signal Vccd is sampled and converted at a time t0 within the
period in which this signal is valid, i.e. has the value Vout.As is shown in Fig. 3B, the converter clock signal CONV is a pulse signal
which is obtained by delaying the clock signal PHI by a predetermined
