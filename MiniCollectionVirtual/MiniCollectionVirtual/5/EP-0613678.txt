<ABSTRACT>
A stable mouth wash or dentifrice composition containing 
stabilized chlorine dioxide and phosphates is disclosed for 

reducing the motility of and killing microbial pathogens. The 
preferred concentration ranges are between about 0.005% - 0.5% 

chlorine dioxide, and between about 0.02% - 3.0% phosphate. The 
phosphate retards escape of chlorine dioxide in the pH range (6.0 

to 7.4) typically found in a mouth.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a method and 
composition for prevention and treatment of gingivitis and 
periodontitis, as well as dental caries. More particularly, the 
present invention relates to the use of phosphates in conjunction 
with stabilized chlorine dioxide to provide a mouth rinse or 
nonsudsing detergent toothpaste having increased stability and 
shelf life at a pH which maintains the effectiveness of 
stabilized chlorine dioxide in reducing the motility of and in 
killing bacterial pathogens. The volatile sulfur compounds, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) 
methylmercaptan (CH3SH) and di-methylmercaptan (CH3)2S are 
recognized in the current dental literature as being the major 
contributors to oral malodor. Numerous researchers using 
organoleptic, chemical, amperometric, mass spectrometric, gas or 
liquid chromatographic methods have demonstrated that these 
volatile sulfur compounds are present in the head space and vapor 
of putrefied saliva and in individual samples of mouth air. In  
 
most persons, hydrogen sulfide and methylmercaptan constitute 
over 90% of the total volatile sulfur content identified in mouth 
air. Further, the sulfur compounds increase the ability of 
bacteria and their toxic byproducts to penetrate the lining 
epethelial barrier of oral mucosa and penetrate into the 
underlying connective tissue. (Gaffer and Rizzo papers 
referenced in "Effect of Hydrogen Sulfide and Methyl Mercaptan on 
the Permeability of Oral Mucosa, J. Dent Res. 63(7), July 1984, 
pages 994-997). These malodorous volatile sulfur compounds are generated 
primarily through the putreficative action of oral microorganisms 
on sulfur containing amino acids, peptones or proteins found in 
the mouth. These substrates are readily available in saliva and 
dental plaque or may be derived from proteinaceous food particles 
trapped between the teeth, in the gingival crevices or adhering 
to the mucous membranes and the irregular surface of the tongue 
as well as exfoliated oral epithelium food debris and the like. 
Current studies have indicated that mouth odor not only comes 
from the posterior dorsal surface of the tongue but also from 
periodontal pockets. People with periodontal involvement have an 
attendant increase in oral malodor from disintegrated epithelial 
cells. Starting with a clean tooth surface, plaque formation and 
resulting ecology occurs in the following steps:  
 
1. Deposition of a coating of glycoproteins from salivary 
and other oral mucous gland secretions. This is referred to as

<CLAIMS>
A composition in the form of a dentifrice or mouthwash for 
preventing and treating dental disease by reducing the number of microorganisms 

in the mouth, said composition comprising: 

(i) stabilized chlorine dioxide in a concentration in the range of 
0.005% - 0.5% by volume based on the total volume of the composition; 

and 
(ii) a stabiliser comprising a phosphate compound in a 
concentration in the range of 0.02% - 3.0% by volume to retard escape 

of chlorine dioxide from the composition at a pH of from 6.0 to 7.4 
thereby increasing the shelf life and efficacy of the composition. 
A composition as claimed in claim 1, containing at least 0.1% by 
volume of stabilised chlorine dioxide and at least 0.05% by volume of the 

phosphate. 
The composition as set forth in claim 2, wherein the concentration 
of stabilized chlorine dioxide is approximately 0.2% by volume and the 

concentration of phosphate is approximately 1.0% by volume. 
A composition as claimed in claim 1, wherein the phosphate is 
mono-, or di-basic sodium phosphate, or pyrophosphate. 
The composition as set forth in any of claims 1 to 4, wherein the 
phosphate is disodium hydrogen phosphate, sodium dihydrogen phosphate, 

sodium monofluorophosphate or pyrophosphate. 
The composition as set forth in claim 5, wherein the phosphate is 
sodium dihydrogen phosphate.  

 
The composition as set forth in any of claims 1 to 3, wherein the 
phosphate is trisodium phosphate. 
A composition as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the 
disease is caused by 
Streptococcus mutans
, 
S. sanguis
 or 
Candida 
albicans
. 
Use of a phosphate compound at a concentration in the range of 
from 0.02 to 3.0% by volume as a stabiliser to retard escape of chlorine 

dioxide from a mouthwash or dentifrice composition at a pH of from 6.0 
to 7.4, said composition containing 0.005 to 0.5% by volume stabilised 

chlorine dioxide. 
Use as claimed in claim 9, wherein the phosphate is sodium 
monofluorophosphate or pyrophosphate, disodium hydrogen phosphate or 

sodium dihydrogen phosphate. 
Use as claimed in claim 9, wherein the phosphate is trisodium 
phosphate. 
Use of a composition as defined in any one of claims 1 to 7 in the 
manufacture of a dentifrice or mouthwash for treating dental disease by 

reducing the number of microorganisms in the mouth.
