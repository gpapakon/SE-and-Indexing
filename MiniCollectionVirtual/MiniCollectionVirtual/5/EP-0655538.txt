<ABSTRACT>
A device for adjusting the length of a support 
composed of an outer tube (12) and an inner tube (13) slidably inserted 

in the outer tube, includes an opening (20) extending radially 
through the outer tube, a spacer (22) radially movably received 

in the opening and confronted with an outer surface of the 
inner tube, a housing (21) mounted on the outer tube in confronting 

relation to the opening, and a wedge (24) slidably inserted 
in the housing to force the spacer radially inwardly against 

the inner tube. With this construction, the inner tube and 
the outer tube can be firmly fastened together with a great 

tightening force without damaging the inner tube. A stopper (25) 
pivoted on the wedge and normally urged upward by a spring 

is able to preclude an unintended omission of driving the 
wedge or an incompletely driven or tightened condition of 

the wedge.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for adjusting the length
of a member such as a support suitable for use as a main
support or standard, a reinforcing horizontal member or
brace or a reinforcing diagonal member or brace for a scaffold,
or a main support or post or a reinforcing brace for
timbering.In a scaffold or a timber structure for building
construction and civil engineering, there are used a number
of vertical main supports and reinforcing horizontal and
diagonal members interconnecting the main supports. More
particularly, each adjacent pair of the main supports are
interconnected by the so-called "support" or "brace" which
is adjustable in length.Lengthwise adjustable supports of this type are
known as disclosed, for example, in Japanese Patent Laid-open
Publication No. 58-123968 and Japanese Utility Model
Publication No. 40-917.The support disclosed in Japanese Utility Model
Publication No. 40-917 includes, as illustrated in
FIG. 12, an outer tube 1 and an inner tube 2 inserted in the 
outer tube 1 to constitute the support 3. The outer tube 1
has on its outer surface a housing 4 located at the front
end of the outer tube 1 for guiding a wedge 5. The wedge 5
has teeth on its front inner surface and is slidably inserted
in the housing 5.While the wedge 5 is loosened, the inner tube 2 is
moved into and out from the outer tube 1 to adjust the
overall length of the support 3. When the wedge 5 is driven
or forced into the housing 4 at a desired position, the
inner tube 2 is locked in position against displacement so
that a predetermined length of the support 3 is secured.The disclosed conventional length adjusting device
of the support is advantageous in that the length of the
support 3 can be set only by driving the wedge 5. However,
since the teeth on the front inner surface of the wedge 5
slide along an outer surface of the inner tube 2, the outer
surface of the outer tube 1 is damaged by the teeth when the
wedge 5 is driven into and out from the housing 4. With the
outer surface thus damaged, the strength of the inner tube 2
may be reduced and the inner tube 2 is susceptible to rust.In addition, since a tightening force produced by
the wedge 5 acts on the inner tube 2 from a direction
oblique to the axis of the inner tube 2, the tightening
force in itself is relatively small and is incapable of
keeping the inner tube in position against accidental slip 
when the inner tube is subjected to a severe tensile force X1 or a severe compressive
force X2.In particular, when the inner tube 2 is subjected

<CLAIMS>
A length-adjustable support (6), comprising:

an outer tube (12) and an inner tube (13) slidably inserted in said outer tube,
said outer tube having an opening (20) extending radially therethrough at a given

position;
a hollow housing (21) mounted on said outer tube adjacent said opening;
a spacer (22) received in said opening and adjacent an outer surface of said
inner tube; and
a wedge (24) movably inserted in said housing and adjacent said spacer;

   characterised in that:

said spacer is moveable in a direction perpendicular to the length of the inner
tube;
said inner tube includes a connecting plate (15) attached to an inner end
thereof and having an oblong hole (16) extending longitudinally of said connecting

plate; and
said outer tube includes a connecting rod (17) extendable diametrically through
said outer tube via said oblong hole.
A support according to claim 1, wherein said wedge (24) has a recessed (24d)
portion on its outer surface, a stopper (25) pivotally mounted in said recessed portion,

via a pin, for indicating a tightened condition of said wedge, and a spring (27), acting
between an outer surface of said recessed portion and said stopper, for urging an end

of said stopper upwardly.
A support according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein said spacer has on its
under surface at least one tooth (22b) engageable in point-contact or in linear-contact

with said outer surface of said inner tube.
A support, according to any preceding claim, wherein:

said outer tube has a second opening (20b) provided diametrically opposite to
said first opening; 
a second hollow housing (21b) mounted on said outer tube adjacent said
second opening;
a second spacer (22) radially movably received in said second opening and
adjacent an outer surface of said inner tube; and
a second wedge (24f) movably inserted in said second housing and adjacent
said second spacer.
A support according to claim 4, wherein respective inner surfaces (bl,b2) of
said first and second housings or respective outer surfaces of said first and second

spacers (22) have tapered surfaces tapering off in the same direction, and said first
and second wedges can be inserted from the same direction.
A support according to claim 4, wherein respective inner surfaces (bl,b2) of
said first and second housings or respective outer surfaces of said first and second

spacers (22) have tapered surfaces tapering off in opposite directions, and said first
and second wedges can be inserted from opposite directions.
