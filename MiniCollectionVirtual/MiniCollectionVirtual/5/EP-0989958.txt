<ABSTRACT>
Nitrates are reduced to nitrogen gas by contacting the nitrates with a metal to reduce the nitrates to nitrites which are then contacted with an amide to produce carbon dioxide and nitrogen which can be released to the atmosphere. Minor amounts of metal catalysts can be useful in the reduction of the nitrates to nitrites. Metal salts which are formed can be treated electrochemically to recover the metals.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to reduction of nitrates, particularly nitrates in waste
streams.This invention was made with government support under Contract No. W-7405-ENG-36
awarded by the U.S. Department of Energy. The government has certain rights
in the invention.Nitrate wastes represent an environmental problem. Nitrate-based solvents are
used in weapons research and production. Mining, chemical, farming and other
industries are also major generators of nitrate wastes. Such wastes contaminate natural
waters if released into the environment. The strong oxidizing power of nitrates causes
excessive biological activity, growth of the vegetation, and precipitation of organic
residue to the bottoms of streams, rivers, lakes, and oceans. As a result of precipitation of
organic residue from nitrate waste streams, water reservoirs become shallow and
eventually are converted to marshes and decay. There have been developed several methods of treating nitrates in
industrial and agricultural waste streams to covert the nitrates to less
environmentally hazardous substances, but no simple, economical process
for destruction or separation of nitrates from aqueous solutions is known.
Generally nitrate wastes are treated by concentration in reverse osmosis,
electrodialysis, evaporation, and ion exchange processes. Although the
nitrates are at much reduced volume and increased concentration, the
products of these processes are still nitrate wastes.Evaporation is used to convert the nitrates into solid nitrate salts which
can be thermally destroyed. Usually thermal treatments result in undesirable
nitrogen oxides. Both evaporation and thermal destruction are very energy
intensive processes.Although nitrates can be reduced to nitrogen gas and ammonia by
biological destruction, this process is slow, difficult to control and results in an
organic residue.Nitrates have been treated with supercritical water or wet air oxidation
methods. However, these methods require extreme temperatures and
pressures. The equipment is not easy to operate particularly when dealing
with waste streams having inconsistent contents or concentrations. Products
of nitrate reduction with supercritical fluids may contain undesirable NOx
components. In Japanese Patent No. 53 067678 a method of purifying waste
gases of both sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide using inorganic amides is
disclosed.There is still a need for easily controlled method of converting nitrate
wastes at moderate temperatures and pressures to more environmentally
benign substances.

<CLAIMS>
A method for treatment of aqueous nitrate-containing liquids streams
comprising the steps of:


(a) acidifying the nitrate-containing liquid;
(b) contacting the solution thus formed with at least one metal, whereby
the nitrate contained therein is converted to nitrite; and
(c) contacting the resulting nitrite-containing solution with at least one
organic amide, whereby the nitrite is reacted to form nitrogen.
A method as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised in that
 said steps of
acidifying the nitrate-containing liquid, contacting the resulting solution with at

least one metal, and contacting the nitrite-containing solution with at least one
organic amide are carried out simultaneously in the same reactor vessel.
A method as claimed in claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 the at least
one metal is selected from cadmium, zinc, lead, iron, silver, copper, mercury,

tin, nickel, manganese, magnesium, and alloys or mixtures thereof.
A method as claimed in claim 1, 2 or 3, 
characterised in that
 the at
least one organic amide is selected from urea, formamide, acetamide, and

mixtures thereof.
A method as claimed in any preceding claim, 
characterised in that

metal ions formed by said step of contacting the nitrate-containing solution
with at least one metal are electrochemically recovered in metallic form.
A method as claimed in any preceding claim, 
characterised in that
 said
aqueous nitrate-containing liquids include slurries.
