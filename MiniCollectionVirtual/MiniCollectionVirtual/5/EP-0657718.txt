<ABSTRACT>
A small and highly sensitive capacitance type pressure 
sensor is obtained by filling an alkali halide material (2) such as 

KBr into a through-hole, forming a conductive thin film (4) on the 
surface, and dissolving and removing the alkali halide material 

(2). 
An insulating plate (1) disposed with a through-hole in the 
thickness direction is filled with a molten alkali halide 

material (2) such as KBr. After forming a conductive thin film (4) 
on the surface of the alkali halide material (2) filled into the 

through-hole and the vicinity thereof, the alkali halide material 
(2) is dissolved by 
water and removed. In this way, a diaphragm is 
made of the through-hole and the conductive thin film (4). A curve 

of the diaphragm caused by a pressure difference between the both 
faces of the conductive thin film (4) is detected as a capacitance 

change between the conductive thin film (4) and the electrode layer 
(6).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a capacitance type sensor which
is useful as a pressure sensor or as an acceleration sensor by
using a thin film diaphragm. This invention further relates to a
method of manufacturing this capacitance type sensor. In
particular, this invention relates to a capacitance type sensor
which does not require chemical etching and a method of
manufacturing the same.Process Instrumentation, Vol. 1, No. 3, June 1972, pages
138-143, describes a variable capacitance signal
transduction and a comparison with other transduction
schemes. This document discloses in a general manner a simple
capacitance type pressure transducer wherein a thin
conductive film represented in practice by a stretched
diaphragm serves as the moving electrode of the variable
capacitance transducer.US-A-4,530,029 describes a capactive pressure sensor with
low parasitic capacitance wherein a silicone diaphragm
moving electrode is bonded to the side walls of the sensor
using the field assissted sealing technique of joining glass
to semi-conductors.US-A-4,823,230 discloses a pressure transducer of the
deflecting membrane type.Recently, pressure sensors are in wide use, varying from
industrial plants to domestic electrical appliances. In
particular, since a semiconductor pressure sensor utilizes both
excellent mechanical characteristics of silicon and high
productivity of semiconductor manufacturing techniques, it has
become an indispensable component when used in combination with a
microcomputer, for automatic control system which is moving
towards intelligence and high efficiency. Generally, a
semiconductor pressure sensor can be classified into a
piezoresistance type and a capacitance type. The piezoresistance
type pressure sensor uses a piezoresistance effect of silicon,
and applies a method of detecting a diaphragm curve as a change
of resistance amount in diffusion resistance. This sensor is
produced in the usual semiconductor manufacturing process. On
the other hand, the capacitance type pressure sensor applies a  
system of picking out a capacitance change between a fixed
electrode and a diaphragm as an electric signal, and this type of
sensor has high sensitivity and good temperature characteristics.Also recently, along with the demand for improvements in
controlling stability and safety in the field of automobiles,
suspension brake systems and air bag systems have gradually come
into wide use. Therefore, there is a great demand for an
acceleration sensor, and the development of a semiconductor
curved gage type
