<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to data reproducing devices. Preferred embodiments of this invention disclosed hereinbelow seek to provide 
an improvement of a previously proposed data reproducing device disclosed in our 
U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 08/165,885 filed on 14 December 1993, the 
embodiments relating to a data reproducing device which is suitable for use to 
reproduce both video data and audio data recorded on an optical disc in a time 
division multiplexed (TDM) mode while separating and decoding these data. Fig. 1 of the accompanying drawings is a block diagram showing the data 
reproducing device which is disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 
08/165,885 (Fig. 6). The data reproducing device has a disc driver 1 for reproducing data from an 
optical disc, on which video data and audio data are recorded in a time division 
multiplexed (TDM) mode, a decoding unit 2 to which reproduction data output from 
the driver 1 is supplied to decode the input data, and an ECC circuit 3 for receiving 
data output from the decoding unit 2 to detect and correct errors of the data. The 
output of the ECC circuit 3 is supplied to each of a ring buffer 4 and an address 
extracting circuit 31. The ring buffer 4 serves to accumulate a predetermined amount 
of data input thereto, and then output the  
 
accumulated data to a multiplexed data separating unit 5. The multiplexed data separating unit 5 has a data separation 
circuit 21 for separating each of video data, audio data, an SCR 
(system clock reference), a DTS (decoding time stamp) for video 
data (hereinafter referred to as "DTSV"), and a DTS for audio 
data (hereinafter referred to as "DTSA") from data supplied from 
the ring buffer 4. A data format for the data to be supplied to multiplexed 
data separation unit 5 is defined as shown in Fig. 2, for 
example. The format is defined as a multiplexed bit stream of 
MPEG (ISO11172). As shown in Fig.2, the multiplexed bit stream 
comprises one or more packs (PACK), and each pack comprises one 
or more packet (PACKET). At the head of the pack is disposed a 
pack header (PACK HEADER), and at the packheader are disposed a 
pack start code (PACK START CODE) representing a start point of 
the pack, SCR and MUX RATE. The SCR represents a time when its 
final byte is input to the multiplexed data separation unit 5 (a 
time when a demultiplexing operation is started). The MUX RATE 
represents a transmission rate. In an embodiment shown in Fig. 2, a video packet (VIDEO 
PACKET) and an audio packet (AUDIO
