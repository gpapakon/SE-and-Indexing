<ABSTRACT>
The apparatus for continuous filtration and drying of a solid suspension comprises a belt filter (1) and a subsequent belt dryer (2). The filter cake generated in the belt filter (1) is transported further by a porous transport belt (3) into the belt dryer (2) in which heaters are provided for heating and drying the filter cake (7) situated on the transport belt (3). After it leaves the belt filter (1), the filter cake (7) is present on the transport belt (3) in the form of a layered, gas-permeable solids bed having a layer thickness of at most 50 mm, preferably at most 20 mm. The heaters in the belt dryer (2) comprise on the one hand a hot gas chamber (8) arranged above the transport belt (3) to generate a hot gas flowing through the solids bed from top to bottom and, on the other hand, one or more contact heating elements (10, 15, 18, 19, 20, 22) arranged above and/or beneath the transport belt (3).

<CLAIMS>
Device for filtering a suspension of solids and for 
drying the remaining filter cake with a porous 

transport medium (3) which is guided through a belt 
filter (1) and a following belt dryer (2) with heating 

devices for introducing heat into the filter cake (7) 
located on the transport medium (3), characterized in 

that after leaving the belt filter (1) the filter cake 
(7) is present on the transport medium (3) in the form 

of a layer-shaped, gas-permeable heap of solids with a 
layer thickness of 50 mm maximum, preferably 
<
= 20 mm, 
and that the heating devices in the belt dryer (2) 

comprise a hot gas chamber (8) arranged above the 
transport medium (3) and for generating a hot gas 

flowing through the heap of solids from top to bottom, 
on the one hand, and one or more contact heating 

elements (10, 15, 18, 19, 20, 22) arranged above 
and/or below the transport medium (3), on the other 

hand. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in that the 
contact heating element comprises a perforated heating 

belt (10) which circulates above the transport medium 
(3) and is in contact with the heap of solids. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in that the 
contact heating elements comprise heated, perforated 

dies (18) which are arranged above the transport 
medium (3) and can be moved perpendicular to the 

transport medium (3). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in that the 
contact heating elements comprise heated filtrate 

troughs (15, 19) which are arranged underneath the 
transport medium (3), are provided with webs and whose 

surfaces are in contact with the transport medium (3).  
 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in that the 
contact heating elements comprise heated rollers (22) 

which are arranged underneath the transport medium (3) 
and whose surfaces are in contact with the transport 

medium (3). 
Device according to Claim 1 to 5, characterized in 
that rake or spiked roller shaped rake elements (16) 

are fitted between the belt filter (1) and the belt 
dryer (2) to loosen the heap of solids. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in that the 
contact heating elements comprise heated vanes (20) 

which are arranged above the transport medium and 
project into the heap of solids. 
Device according to Claim 1 to 7, characterized in 
that radiant heaters (21) are fitted in the hot gas 

chamber (8) for an additional heating of the heap of 
solids by means of radiant heat. 
Device according to Claim 2, characterized in that the 
transport medium (3) and the heating belt (10) 

comprise a material that is high-temperature resistant 
up to temperatures of 230 Â°C. 
Device according to Claim 1 to 9, characterized in 
that the belt filter (1) and the belt dryer (2) are 

surrounded by a common pressure-resistant housing 
(17).
