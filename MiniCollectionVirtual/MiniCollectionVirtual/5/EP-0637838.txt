<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to integrated circuits with self-aligned 
deposited field oxides and to such circuits fabricated with bonded wafers . Although most silicon integrated circuits presently use metal oxide 
semiconductor(MOS) field effect transistors, there are many integrated circuits made 
that use bipolar transistors. In particular, bipolar technologies have been developed 
with polysilicon emitters to minimize diffusion and reduce emitter to base 
capacitance, special oxidation steps to minimize the base capacitance, smaller 
geometries to reduce parasitic capacitance, and bonded SOI (Silicon on Insulator) 
wafers to minimize the collector to substrate capacitance. All of these developments 
fundamentally are directed toward increasing the operational speed of the bipolar 
device. In order to minimize the parasitic collector resistance, a heavily doped 
buried layer is implanted into the silicon wafer prior to epitaxial growth. The 
subsequent epitaxial layer is typically doped for the intrinsic collector region and is 
used to form the base and emitter regions. The combination of the buried layer and 
the initial silicon wafer impurity concentration determine two fundamental 
parasitics: the collector resistance and the collector to substrate capacitance. To 
minimize collector capacitance, a lightly doped substrate is required. A secondary 
parasitic device, namely an SCR device, is formed by multiple closely spaced 
transistors and leads to latch-up. This device limits the spacing between transistors. 
Therefore, opposing parasitics create fundamental limitation of the bipolar transistor 
technologies. These basic limitations, and the elimination of latch-up, are realized 
with the use of bonded SOI wafers in which the individual transistor can be totally 
isolated by a dielectric. This is typically achieved by use of a buried oxide wafer 
with a refilled trench surrounding each active device. The most common method of trench isolation, for bipolar technologies, 
is to etch a "moat" through the silicon to the buried oxide, oxidize the remaining 
silicon, deposit a thick layer of polysilicon and finally polish away the excess 
polysilicon from over the active area regions. This method is used because of the 
silicon thickness necessary to accommodate the desired 5µm heavily doped buried 
layer. In CMOS technologies, where the buried layer is not utilized, it is possible to 
create the trench region by use of LOCOS or SWAMI field oxide methods. LOCOS  
 
and SWAMI are well known
