<ABSTRACT>
Customary integrable differential amplifiers have implanted resistors as load resistors, the limited magnitude of which represents a barrier for minimising the current consumption. According to the invention, the load resistors are replaced by load elements which represent non-linear two-terminal networks, such as, for example, diodes, the potential across these load elements being kept constant by means of a control loop, using a control element, for example a control transistor. As a result, the current consumption of differential amplifier stages can be reduced as far as the order of magnitude of residual currents, without any increase in the area required for the integration of the circuit.
