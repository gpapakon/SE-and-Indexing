<ABSTRACT>
Removing hydrogen sulphide from a gas stream (4) comprises contacting 
the gas stream in the presence of free oxygen at a temperature 

in the range of from the dew point of water to the dew point of 
elemental sulphur in two catalytic reactors (1 and 2) with catalytic 

material to obtain elemental sulphur which is deposited on the 
catalytic material and a purified gas stream, wherein the gas 

stream is contacted in the first catalytic reactor (1) with catalytic 
material in the presence of a sub-stoichiometric amount of 

free oxygen to obtain a partly purified gas stream (20d), which 
partly purified gas stream (20d) is contacted in the second catalytic 

reactor (2) in the presence of an additional amount of free 
oxygen with catalytic material to obtain the purified gas stream 

(5).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process of removing hydrogen 
sulphide from a gas stream. An example of such a gas stream is a 
natural gas. In International patent application publication No. 92/02 449 
is described a process for removing hydrogen sulphide from a gas 
stream, which process comprises contacting the gas stream at a 
temperature above the dew point of elemental sulphur in the presence 
of free oxygen with catalytic material in a first catalytic 
reactor to obtain a partly purified gas stream and contacting the 
partly purified gas stream at a temperature between the dew point 
of water and the dew point of elemental sulphur with catalytic 
material in a second catalytic reactor to obtain a purified gas 
stream. In the known process air is supplied to the gas stream upstream 
of the first catalytic reactor. Free oxygen in the air oxidises 
hydrogen sulphide directly to elemental sulphur according to the 
reaction: 
H₂S +1/2 O₂ → H₂O + 1/x Sx.Although the publication is silent about the amount of free 
oxygen supplied to the first catalytic reactor, this amount is in 
general stoichiometric or slightly super-stoichiometric. That is to 
say the ratio between the concentrations of oxygen and hydrogen 
sulphide is 0.5, the stoichiometric ratio, or more; the unit of 
this ratio being mol/mol, or vol/vol at standard pressure and 
temperature. In the specification and in the claims the ratio 
between the concentrations of oxygen and hydrogen sulphide will be 
called the "oxygen-hydrogen sulphide ratio". Applicant now proposes to contact a gas stream with catalytic 
material in a first catalytic reactor at a temperature which is 
between the dew point of water and the dew point of elemental  
 
sulphur so that elemental sulphur is adsorbed on the catalytic 
material in the first catalytic reactor. The first catalytic 
reactor is used for bulk removal of hydrogen sulphide and the 
second catalytic reactor is used for removing traces of hydrogen 
sulphide from the gas leaving the first catalytic reactor. As the process of the present invention the first catalytic 
reactor is used to remove the bulk of the hydrogen sulphide from 
the gas stream, the largest part of the elemental sulphur formed is 
adsorbed on the catalytic material in this catalytic reactor. The 
adsorbed elemental sulphur improves the activity of the catalytic 
material. However, when the amount of elemental sulphur adsorbed on 
the catalytic material is above a certain level, the conversion of 
hydrogen sulphide starts to

Process of removing hydrogen sulphide from a gas stream comprising 
contacting the gas stream in the presence of free oxygen at 

a temperature in the range of from the dew point of water to the 
dew point of elemental sulphur in two catalytic reactors with 

catalytic material to obtain elemental sulphur which is deposited 
on the catalytic material and a purified gas stream, wherein the 

gas stream is contacted in the first catalytic reactor with catalytic

free oxygen with respect to the amount required for the 

conversion of H₂S into sulfur, to obtain a partly purified gas stream, which partly

the presence of additional free oxygen with catalytic material to 
obtain the purified gas stream. 
Process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the gas stream is 
contacted in the first catalytic reactor with catalytic material in 

the presence of such an amount of free oxygen that the oxygen-hydrogen 
sulphide ratio is in the range of from 0.40 to 0.49.
