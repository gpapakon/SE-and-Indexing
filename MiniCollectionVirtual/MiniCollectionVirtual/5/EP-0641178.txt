Surgical suturing instrument, 

a) having an instrument shaft (20), which includes a 
distal end, which is to be inserted into the body of a 

patient, and a proximal end, 
b) having two oppositely situated jaws (23, 24) at the 
distal end of the instrument shaft (20), 
c) the first jaw (23) being securedly connected to the 
instrument shaft (20), and 
d) the second jaw (24) being displaceably disposed on 
the instrument shaft (20) opposite the first jaw (23), 
e) having a channel (43) in the instrument shaft (20) 
for supplying a suturing material (17) from the proximal end 

to the distal end, which channel terminates on that side 
(40) of the first, stationary jaw (23) lying opposite the 

second, displaceable jaw (24), 
f) having an outer tube (21), which is axially 
displaceable relative to the instrument shaft (20) and is 

disposed between the distal end and the proximal end of the 
instrument shaft (20), such tube surrounding said shaft, 

but leaving the jaws (23, 24) at least partially free, 
g) having a multi-part handle (1, 2) at the proximal 
end of the instrument shaft (20) to actuate the 

displaceable jaw, one part (2) of said handle being 
connected to the proximal end of the instrument shaft (20) 

and an additional part (1) being connected to the outer 
tube (21), 
 
characterised in that 


h) the two jaws (23, 24) can assume a positon relative 
to each other in which they are disposed approximately 

parallel to each other with a spacing therebetween over 
their entire length, and 
i) a plurality of grooves (38) are provided both in 
the displaceable jaw (24) and in the stationary jaw (23) in 

their oppositely situated sides (36, 40) extending from the 
channel (43) for the supply of the suturing material (17),  

 
said grooves being disposed with a spacing therebetween and 

the bottom surfaces thereof lying on a helical line in this 
position. 
Surgical suturing instrument according to claim 1, 
characterised by means (14, 28), whereby the suturing 

material (17) is stepwisely distally displaceable through 
the channel (43) via the handle (1, 2) in such a manner 

that it passes from the end of the channel initially into 
the first of the grooves (38) of the displaceable jaw (24), 

then into the first of the grooves (38) of the stationary 
jaw (23), and finally into the additional grooves of the 

displaceable jaw (24) and of the stationary jaw (23) 
alternately. 
Surgical suturing instrument according to claim 2, 
characterised by a blocking device (57, 58), which acts 

upon the suturing material (17) in the channel (43), and 
which releases the suturing material (17) only during 

distal displacement. 
Surgical suturing instrument according to claim 1 
or 2, characterised in that the displaceable jaw (24) is 

displaceable from the parallel position both towards and 
away from the stationary jaw (23) via the handle (1, 2). 
Surgical suturing instrument according to claim 1 
or 4, characterised in that the outer tube (21) has, at its 

distal end, two oppositely situated notches (25), which are 
disposed symmetrically relative to a plane extending 

parallel to the side (40) of the stationary jaw (23), which 
lies opposite the displaceable jaw (24). 
Surgical suturing instrument according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the two jaws (23, 24) have, on their 

oppositely situated sides (36, 40) in the distal region 
before the grooves (38), closely adjacent indentations (62)  

 
which extend parallel to the grooves (38), the spacing 

between said indentations being 1/n of the spacing between 
the grooves (38), n being a whole number. 
Surgical suturing instrument according to claim 1 
or 2, characterised in that the grooves (38) are widened 

in the form of a funnel (50) at the ends which are 
initially reached by the suturing material (17) during its 

distal displacement. 
Surgical suturing instrument according to one of 
claims 1 to 7, characterised in that the stationary jaw 

(23) includes a displaceable carriage (45) provided with a 
cutting edge (41), by means of which the suturing material 

(17) can be severed. 
Surgical suturing instrument according to claim 4, 
characterised in that 


a part (61), which has a V-shaped cross-section and 
is orientated towards the stationary jaw (23) with its 

vertical edge, is attached to the displaceable jaw (24) 
internally of the ou
ter tube (21), 
the vertical edge extends perpendicularly relative 
to the axis of the outer tube (21) and is mounted in a 

recess (46), which extends perpendicularly relative to the 
axis of the outer tube (21), 
a pin (35) is attached to the distal end of the 
outer tube (21) so that the portion with the V-shaped 

cross-section is rotated by the pin (35) in the recess 
(46) as a result of the proximal displacement of the outer 

tube (21) relative to the instrument shaft (20), whereby 
the displaceable jaw (24) moves away from the stationary 

jaw (23). 
Surgical suturing instrument according to claim 4, 
characterised in that the displaceable jaw (24) has, on its 

side remote from the stationary jaw (23), an arched portion  
 

(37) by means of which said displaceable jaw executes a 
movement towards the stationary jaw (23) when the outer 

tube (21) is moved distally beyond the parallel position. 
Surgical suturing instrument according to one of 
claims 1 to 8, characterised in that one of the two jaws 

(23, 24) on the side (36, 40) situated opposite the other 
jaw, has a mandrel which engages in a recess in the other 

jaw in the parallel position.
