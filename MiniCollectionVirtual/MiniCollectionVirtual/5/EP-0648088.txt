<ABSTRACT>
A noninvasive device and methods for measuring the end-tidal carbon monoxide concentration in a patient's breath, particularly newborn and premature infants. The patient's breath is monitored. An average carbon monoxide concentration is determined based on an average of discrete samples in a given time period. The ratio of the end-tidal portion of the breath flow sample is separately determined, preferably based on monitoring the level of carbon dioxide in the gas sample and identifying the carbon dioxide concentration levels corresponding to the end-tidal portion of the breath sample. The sensed carbon monoxide level is converted to the end-tidal carbon monoxide level by subtracting the ambient carbon monoxide level and dividing the remainder by the ratio of end-tidal breath to breath in the breath sample. An easy to use microcontroller-based device containing a carbon dioxide detector, a carbon monoxide detector and a pump for use in a hospital, home, physician's office or clinic by persons not requiring high skill and training is described. A replaceable filter unit made of a single tri-lumen PVC extrusion and a tube segment interconnecting two of the lumens used to provide the consumable filtration material. The filtration material is interposed between the carbon dioxide sensor and the carbon monoxide sensor which are mounted inside the monitor housing. The filter unit also interfaces the canula for receiving the patient's breath sample and a hydrophobic filter between the patient and the carbon dioxide monitor. The filter unit is replaceable when the filtration medium is no longer effective or for use with different patients and may be disposable.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods and apparatus for in-vivo,
real time measurement of end-tidal carbon monoxide
concentration in the exhaled breath, more particularly to
the determination of end-tidal carbon monoxide concentration
in the breath of a newborn infant and to a filter unit for
use in such a determination.In most animal systems, carbon monoxide is a waste
product produced in the breakdown of free hemoglobin within
the blood. Ordinarily, hemoglobin is contained within red
blood cells and is stable. However, aging of red blood
cells and certain disease processes produce hemolysis, i.e.,
the breakdown of the cell wall. This produces free
hemoglobin which breaks down in the blood. The carbon
monoxide that is produced by the breakdown of free
hemoglobin is normally excreted in the breath.When the system is in equilibrium, the carbon monoxide
concentration in the breath is proportional to the
difference in the concentration of carbon monoxide in the
blood and the concentration of carbon monoxide in room air.
This difference in concentration is proportional to the rate
of hemolysis in the blood.The concentration of carbon monoxide in the end-tidal
breath, i.e., the gas that is last expelled each breath, is
presumed to be at equilibrium with the concentration in the
blood. This is because the end-tidal breath contains 
predominantly, if not exclusively, the gas expelled from the
alveoli in the lungs, which gas was within the alveoli for a
time generally sufficient to equilibrate with the blood.It is known that hemolysis and the resulting byproducts
and consequences of hemolysis can be estimated or predicted
from a measure of the concentration of carbon monoxide in
the end-tidal breath. See Smith, D.W. et al., "Neonatal
Bilirubin Production Estimated from End-Tidal Carbon
Monoxide Concentration", Journal of Pediatric
Gastroenterology and Nutrition, 3:77-80, 1984.One method of analysis previously reported includes
incrementally acquiring a sample of end-tidal breath and
analyzing the acquired sample by mass spectroscopy or gas
chromatography to determine the end-tidal carbon monoxide
concentration. The sample is obtained by extracting from
each of several successive breaths a portion of the apparent
end-tidal breath using a syringe. The end-tidal portion of
breath is determined by observing the chest movements of the
infant. See, e.g., Vreman et al. U.S. Patent 4,831,024.One problem with this technique is that it requires a
skilled, trained user to obtain the end-tidal sample in
successive increments
