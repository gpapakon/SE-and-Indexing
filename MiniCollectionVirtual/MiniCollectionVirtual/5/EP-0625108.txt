<CLAIMS>
A piston unit (2, 5) for hydraulic cylinders (1, 41) of 
automotive vehicles, in which a piston rod (21, 49) is 

swivellingly fixed within a recess (30) in the piston (2) 
by means of an elastic retaining member (5) which is 

attached to the piston rod (21, 49) and interacts with 
undercuts (25, 65) in the piston (2) and prevents the 

piston rod (21, 49) from sliding out of the piston (2), 
the retaining member (5) having latching noses (10) which 

are supported on the undercuts (25, 65) in the piston (2),
characterized
 in that the piston rod (21, 49) 
has a spherical attachment (20) which is encircled by a 

first cavity (15) of the retaining member (5) and passes 
over into a cylindrical recess (16) that is succeeded by a 

second cavity (17), and in that both in the range of the 
first cavity (15) and in the range of the cylindrical 

recess (16) the retaining member (5) abuts on the inside 
surface of the the recess (30) formed in the piston (2). 
A piston unit as claimed in claim 1,
characterized
 in that the retaining member 
(5) is provided with a cylindrical section (6) having a 

closed bottom (9) and passing over into a conical section 
(12) at its open side, and in that slots (7) are provided 

which extend alongside the conical section (12) up into 
the cylindrical section (6) and form latching noses (10). 
A piston unit as claimed in anyone of claims 1 or 2,
characterized
 in that the latching noses (10) 
are uniformly distributed over the circumference of the 

retaining member (5).  
 
A piston unit as claimed in anyone of the preceding 
claims,
characterized
 in that the second cavity (17) 
has the shape of a truncated cone whose smaller diameter 

corresponds to the diameter of the cylindrical recess (16) 
and whose largest diameter, in the unstressed condition, 

is at least as large as the diameter of the first cavity 
(15). 
A piston unit as claimed in anyone of the preceding 
claims,
characterized
 in that the ends of the 
latching noses (10) are formed with an annular segment-shaped 

section (19) whose periphery is disposed coaxially 
with the axis of the cylinder (1). 
A piston unit as claimed in anyone of the preceding 
claims,
characterized
 in that the cylindrical section 
(6) is provided at its outside with a plurality of 

circumferential bevels (13, 14) having a different 
inclination which increases toward the bottom (9). 
A piston unit as claimed in anyone of claims 1 to 6,
characterized
 in that the latching noses (10) 
are formed with abutment surfaces (27) which make catch at 

the undercuts (25) and are bevelled or rounded off in such 
a manner that, in the event of an outwardly directed 

radial movement of the latching noses (10), a force 
directed toward the bottom (9) of the recess (30) acts on 

the retaining member (5).  
 
A piston unit as claimed in claim 7,
characterized
 in that the abutment surfaces 
(27) are rounded off so as to be circular arc-shaped. 
A piston unit as claimed in anyone of claims 1 to 6,
characterized
 in that the hydraulic cylinder 
(1, 41) is preceded by a power booster (42) whose output 

force is introduced into the piston rod (21, 49) which is 
rigidly coupled to the power booster (42), the-retaining 

member (5) being fixed within the piston (2, 45) so as to 
allow it to be disassembled. 
A piston unit as claimed in claim 9,
characterized
 in that the undercut (25) is 
configured in the shape of a circumferential radial groove 

(23) whose flank (65) facing away from the retaining 
member (5) is obliquely flattened, and in that the 

inclination of the flank (65) corresponds to the 
inclination of an abutment surface (67) which is 

configured at the end of the retaining member (5). 
A piston unit as claimed in claim 9 or 10,
characterized
 in that the power booster (42) 
is a vacuum brake power booster, to the working piston of 

which the piston rod (21, 49) is coupled without play. 
A piston unit as claimed in anyone of the preceding 
claims,
characterized
 in that the retaining member 
(5) is made of plastic material.
