Process for the preparation of a taxane 
derivative of general formula: 


 
in which R represents a hydrogen atom or an acetyl 

radical, R₁ represents a benzoyl radical or a radical 
R₂-O-CO- in which R₂ represents an alkyl, alkenyl, 

alkynyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, bicycloalkyl, phenyl 
or nitrogen containing heterocyclyl radical and Ar 

represents an aryl radical, characterised in that a 
product of general formula: 


 
in which Ar and R₁ are defined as above and R' represents 

an acetyl radical or a 2,2,2-trichloroethoxycarbonyl 
radical, is electrolytically reduced. 
Process according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the electrolyte consists of an 

alkali metal salt or a quaternary ammonium salt which is 
soluble in the solvent or in an aqueous/organic mixture.  

 
Process according to claim 2, 
characterised in that the solvent is chosen from the 

alcohols and the nitriles. 
Process according to claim 3, 
characterised in that the solvent is chosen from methanol 

and acetonitrile. 
Process according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the electrolysis is carried out in 

an electrolyser containing a cathode chosen from mercury, 
zinc, lead and vitreous carbon and an anode chosen from 

platinum, graphite or vitreous carbon. 
Process according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the electrolysis is carried out in 

an electrolyser, preferably a diaphragm electrolyser. 
Process according to claim 6, 
characterised in that the diaphragm consists of a porous 

material or of a cation-exchange membrane. 
Process according to one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the electrolysis is carried out 

with controlled potential. 
Process according to one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the electrolysis is carried out 

with constant current strength. 
Process according to claim 1 for the 
preparation of 4-acetoxy-2α-benzoyloxy-5β,20-epoxy-1,7β,10β-trihydroxy-9-oxo-11-taxen-13α-yl 

(2R,3S)-3-(tert-butoxycarbonylamino)-3-phenyl-2-hydroxypropanoate 
or "Taxotere".
