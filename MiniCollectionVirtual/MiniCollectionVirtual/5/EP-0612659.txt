<ABSTRACT>
A magazine body (2) with a multiplicity of star-shaped magazine chambers (3), by being inserted into an axial clamping device (20), is brought with chamber entrances (4) into overlap with a media overflow orifice (30) and with exits (5) into overlap with a connection orifice (33) of a suction head (17), with the result that the medium is applied without a gap at the entrances (4). By means of the suction head (17), all the magazine chambers (3) are then evacuated and are thereby filled via the overflow (30) from a media supply (12) against a media retention device (36). With the ejection of the filled magazine chambers (3), the entrances and exits (4, 5) are closed in a media-tight manner by the slipping on of closing parts (8, 9).

<CLAIMS>
Device for introducing at least one flowable medium or the like into at 
least one chamber (3) of at least one body (2), particularly for filling dosed 

minimum quantities of under 1 gram filling weight, with at least one filling 
opening (30) connectable to the particular chamber (3) of feed means (50) for 

feeding at least one feed flow containing the medium into the chamber (3), 
characterized in that the feed means (50) is constructed for the at least 

partial flow with the feed flow through the chamber (3) between facing openings 
(4, 5) of the chamber (3). 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that a feed flow is at least 
partly a suction flow, that in particular a feed flow is at least partly a gas 

flow and at least one medium is at least partly non-gaseous and that preferably 
the feed means (50) are provided for the substantially uninterrupted 

filling of the chamber or magazine chamber (3) with at least one non-gaseous medium 
whilst leaving at the most minute quantities of a feed fluid and/or that for 

vacuum filling purposes a feed flow enters at one side (4) of a magazine 
chamber (3) and, whilst leaving behind the medium in the magazine chamber (3), 

passes out from a substantially facing side (5). 
Device according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that for a magazine 
chamber (3) with at least two chamber openings (4, 5), namely a filling inlet 

(4) and an outlet (5), there is at least one medium retaining device (36), 
such as a sieve associated with the outlet (5), that in particular at least 

one feed head (16, 17) for a feed flow connectable in substantially medium-tight 

manner to a chamber opening (4, 5) is provided and that preferably there 
are at least two feed heads (16, 17) movable telescopically against one 

another and with respect to a magazine chamber (2) between filling connection 
positions and release positions. 
Device according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in that 
at least one adjusting member (18, 19, 24) is provided for the relative, 

spatial position change of a magazine chamber (2), that in particular at least 
one adjusting member (19, 24 or 18) is formed by a feed head (17), a forcibly 

controlled adjusting body and/or a spring-controlled adjusting body and that  
 

preferably a mounting support for a magazine chamber (2) has a fastening 
device (20) and/or adjusting members (19, 18) oppositely placeable against 

end faces (6, 7) of a magazine body (2). 
Device according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that at least one filling valve (40) with at least one valve body (41, 42) 

movable between valve positions is provided, that in particular at least one 
valve body (41, 42) is constructed as a valve slide and that preferably at 

least one valve body (42, 41) is formed by a magazine body (2), an adjusting 
member (18) and/or at least one magazine closure (9) and in particular for at 

least one valve opening (30) there are at least two alternate and substantially 
uninterruptedly and successively engageable valve bodies (41, 42). 
Device according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in that 
at least one storage chamber (12) for a medium is provided substantially 

directly adjacent across at least one medium passage (30) with at least one 
medium chamber (3), that in particular a storage chamber (12), with the 

exception of a medium passage (30) is substantially tightly closed and that 
preferably a storage chamber (12) substantially adjacent to a bottom wall (31) 

Is connectable to a medium chamber (3) and/or is constructed as a column store. 
Device according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in that 
with at least one storage chamber (12) for the medium is associated at least 

one device (60, 61) for loosening the medium by moving it within the storage 
chamber (12), that in particular there are medium flows emanating from a bottom 

face (31) or the like in a storage chamber (12) and that preferably for a 
storage chamber (12) there is a discharge device (70) with a retaining device 

(74) for the medium and/or with a collecting chamber (73) connected to a 
plurality of discharge channels (72). 
Device according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in that 
in particular for a magazine body (2) having several adjacent magazine chambers 

(3) arranged round an axis (11), there is a connecting opening (30, 33) 
passing over at least two to all the magazine chambers (3) for a feed flow and/or 

a common medium retaining device (36), that there is in particular at least one 
connecting opening (30, 33) or at least one medium retaining device (36) in  

 
circular form and that preferably at least one connecting opening (30) is a 

valve opening. 
Device according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in that 
at least one body (10) of the device (1) between an outer wall (13) and an 

inner wall (14) bounds an approximately annular storage chamber (12) for a 
medium, that in particular adjacent to one end (31) of a storage chamber (12) 

there is an annular valve body (18) movable with the magazine body (2) for a 
connecting opening (30) and which is movable against a spring member (22), that 

preferably a feed head (17) for a feed flow connectable to a feed source can be 
engaged and disengaged with respect to a circumferential inner wall (14) 

and/or that an inner wall (14) of a storage chamber (12) is constructed as a 
guide for a magazine body (2), a valve body (18), a stored closure (44) and/or 

a magazine closure part (8), that in particular a feed head (17) and an 
ejector (23) for a magazine body (2) face one another and move separately 

and that preferably an inner wall (14) of a storage chamber (12) with an edge 
face (29) bounds a connecting opening (30) for a medium chamber (3).
