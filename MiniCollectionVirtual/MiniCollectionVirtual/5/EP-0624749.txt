<ABSTRACT>
A resin injection method and a pipeline repair 
method are provided for smoothly and rapidly performing 

setting of an open liner and for completing works such 
as eversion and insertion of the open liner even for a 

steeply inclined pipeline. An end portion of an open 
liner (2) is everted such that the end is attached to 

one end of a pipe liner bag (1) which has been 
introduced into a pipeline (4) to be repaired. A resin 

(5) is injected into the open liner (2) from the other 
end thereof while the pipe liner bag (1) is evacuated, 

thus injecting the resin into the pipe liner bag through 
the open liner. After the resin (5) has been injected 

into the pipe liner bag (1) in the above-mentioned 
method, the open liner (2) is everted by fluid pressure 

to be inserted into the pipe liner bag, whereby the 
resin is impregnated into the pipe liner bag. Then, the 

pipe liner bag 1) is pressed against the inner wall of 
the pipeline (4), in which state the resin impregnated 

in the pipe liner bag is cured to repair the pipeline. 
This pipe repair method allows the pot life of the resin 

to be shortened, so that the work time required for the 
repair operations can be reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of repairing a pipeline, and
more particularly to a method of injecting resin into a pipe liner
bag which is used to repair pipelines. The present invention also
relates to a method of repairing pipelines using such a pipe liner
bag which is applicable to repairing pipelines which may be
steeply inclined with respect to the horizontal direction.When an underground pipe, such as a pipeline or passageway,
becomes defective or too old to perform properly, the pipe is
repaired and restored without digging the earth to expose the
pipe and disassembling the sections of the pipe. This non-digging
method of repairing an underground pipe has been known and
practiced commonly in the field of civil engineering. Typically,
the method is disclosed by Japanese Provisional Patent Publication
(Kokai) No. 60-242038.According to the method described in the above-mentioned
publication, the pipe repair method comprises inserting a
sufficiently long tubular flexible liner bag into the pipe to be
repaired by means of a pressurized fluid, such as air or water. The
tubular liner bag is made of a flexible resin-absorbent material
impregnated with a thermosetting resin, and has its outer surface
covered with an impermeable plastic film.More particularly, according to the Publication, the tubular 
flexible liner bag is closed at one end and open at the other; the
tubular flexible liner bag is first flattened, then the closed
end of the tubular liner bag is tied to a control rope; the open
end of the tubular liner bag is made to gape wide and hooked
(anchored) at the end of the defective or old pipe in a manner
such that the wide-opened end of the liner completely and fixedly
covers and closes the pipe end; a portion of the liner is pushed
into the pipe; then, pressurized fluid is applied to the said
portion of the tubular liner such that the fluid urges the tubular
liner to enter the pipe. Since one end of the tubular liner is
hooked at the end of the pipe, it remains there while the rest of
the flexible liner bag is turned inside out as it proceeds deeper
in the pipe. (Hereinafter, this manner of procedure shall be
called "everting".) When the entire length of the tubular liner
bag is everted (i.e., turned inside out) into the pipe, the
control rope holds the closed end of the tubular liner bag to
thereby control the length of the tubular liner in the pipe.
Then, the everted tubular liner is pressed against the inner wall
of the pipe by the said pressurized fluid, and the tubular
flexible

A method of repairing a pipeline (4), comprising the steps of:

(a) introducing a pipe liner bag (1) into a pipeline (4) to be
repaired;
(b) everting an end portion of a tubular open liner (2), which
comprises an inner layer of a resin absorbent material (2A) and an outer

layer of a plastic film (2B) coated over said resin absorbent material, such
that the end portion is attached to one end of the pipe liner bag (1);
(c) injecting a resin (5) into the open liner (2) from the other end
thereof while evacuating the pipe liner bag (1);
(d) injecting a predetermined amount of the resin (5) into the pipe
liner bag (1) through the open liner (2);
(e) everting the open liner (2) by fluid pressure so that the open
liner is inserted into the pipe liner bag (1) to impregnate the resin (5) into

the pipe liner bag;
(f) pressing the pipe liner bag (1) against the inner wall of the
pipeline (4); and
(g) curing the resin (5) impregnated in the pipe liner bag (1), with
the pipe liner bag continuously pressed against the inner wall of the

pipeline (4).
A method as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the resin is a
thermosetting resin. 
A method as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the resin is a
photosetting resin.
A method as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the resin (5) is
