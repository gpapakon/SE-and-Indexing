<ABSTRACT>
A process for the preparation of optically active S-(+)-2-(3-benzoylphenyl)propionic acid (I), by resolution of the racemate through enantioselective hydrolysis of a reactive ester (II) in an organic medium, which hydrolysis is catalysed by an extracellular lipase of microbial origin. The separation of the resulting free acid from the remaining ester is carried out by extraction in basic medium, to leave the S-ester in the organic phase and the R-acid in the aqueous one. Finally, the desired S isomer is obtained either by aqueous hydrolysis of the remaining reactive S-ester, at constant pH, or enzymatically.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the 
preparation of optically active S-(+)-2-(3-benzoylphenyl)propionic 
acid (I), by resolution of the racemate 
through enantioselective hydrolysis of a reactive 
ester (II) in an organic medium, which hydrolysis is 
catalysed by an extracellular lipase of microbial origin. 
The separation of the resulting free acid from the 
remaining ester is carried out by extraction in basic 
medium, to leave the S-ester in the organic phase and 
the R-acid in the aqueous one. Finally, the desired S 
isomer is obtained either by aqueous hydrolysis of the 
remaining reactive S-ester, at constant pH, or enzymatically. A number of antiinflammatory agents of the family 
of the aryl or alkylarylpropionic acids (i.e. naproxen, 
ibuprofen, flurbiprofen, etc.) are known, having a chiral 
center in the α carbon and therefore existing in 
two optically different forms. The higher activity of 
the S enantiomer compared with that of the R one is 
also known [Muller N. et al., Fundam. Clin. Pharmacol. 
4, 617 (1990)]. This is also the case of ketoprofen (S-(+)-2-(3-benzoylphenyl)propionic 
acid), the physiological 
activity of which mainly resides in the S enantiomer 
[Yamaguchi T. et al., Folia Pharmacol. Japon. 90, 
295 (1987)].  
 The achievement of the chiral S-(+)-2-(3-benzoylphenyl)propionic 
acid (I) was approached both by enantioselective 
synthesis [Fadel A., Synlett. 1, 48 
(1992), FR 2,659,968 (21.3.1991)] and by resolution of 
the racemate, and particularly remarkable is the resolution 
by diastereomeric crystallization of a (-)-1-phenylpropylamine 
salt, whereby the S-(+) isomer is obtained 
in a 22% yield after two recrystallizations and 
in an optical purity higher than 99% [Nohira H. et al. 
EP 423,467]. Among the enzymatic methods for the optical 
resolution, only the stereoselective hydrolysis in 
aqueous medium has been applied to the racemic 2-(3-benzoylphenyl)propionic 
acid. Sih et al. [Sih C.L. et 
al., EP 227,078] describe the resolution of this compound 
by hydrolysis of the methyl ester thereof, catalysed 
by a purified form of the lipase from Candida 
cylindracea, with optical purity values higher than 95% 
and in a 78% yield. In spite of these results, the procedure 
seems to be poorly economically convenient due 
to the need to modify-purify the enzyme. On the other 
hand, Cerbelaud D. et al. [EP 330529 and FR 2626288] 
describe the resolution by enantioselective hydrolysis 
of the nitrile and the corresponding amide catalysed by 
microorganisms such
