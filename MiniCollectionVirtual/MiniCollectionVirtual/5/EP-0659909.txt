<ABSTRACT>
A plate-, foil- or web-shaped workpiece of aluminum 
or an alloy thereof is subjected, in an electrolyte 

bath, to an alternating current at a frequency of 0.1 
to 25 Hz. During the AC treatment, an anodic 

potential is imposed on the workpiece, in the range 
of 0 to 5 Volts. The total charge input is 10 to 60 

kC/mÂ². Prior to the electrochemical graining, the 
workpiece is mechanically grained. After the graining 

steps, an etching treatment as well as an anodical 
oxidation and, thereafter, a hydrophilization are 

performed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of electrochemically graining a surface of a plate-,
foil-, web-shaped workpiece of aluminum or an aluminum alloy, which method
comprises subjecting the workpiece in an electrolyte to an AC treatment of an electric
alternating current.As a result of using low frequency AC, together with other features as described below,
the coulombic input of the workpiece can be substantially reduced. A major use for the
invention will be in the electrochemical graining or roughening of aluminum metal
sheets for use as lithograpic plate supports.US-A 4,897,168 is related to a roughening method using pulsed direct current. A
rectangular direct current pulse has an anodic pulse duration longer than a cathodic
pulse duration, followed by a pulseless state and a mirror-inverted rectangular direct
current pulse of an anodic pulse duration shorter than a cathodic pulse duration. There
is only used pulsed direct current voltage to produce a pulse-formed standing waveform
in the electrolyte bath for the electromechanically roughening step.US-A 4,482,434 describes a process for electromechanical roughening aluminum or
alloys thereof under the action of an alternating current having a frequency in the
range from 0.3 to 15 Hz.US-A-5 213 666 discloses a method of preparing an aluminum support by roughening
electrochemically the surface of the support by supplying pulse-formed DC potential to
a plurality of cathodes, over which the support is moved in an aqueous neutral salt
solution. The surface of the support is rendered an anode, without impressing an
alternating current voltage to the support. The roughening devices used in this method
utilizes continuous direct current voltage which is supplied to the aluminum support. US-A 4,468,295 describes a process for electrochemical roughening aluminum or
alloys thereof under the action of an alternating current which is generated by
superimposing two different frequences. Neither patent contains any suggestion
that the total coulombic charge input required to electrograin sheet for use as a
lithographic plate support can be reduced.EP 317 866 A describes a method for producing an aluminum support for a
printing plate, by passing the support through an acidic electrolyte past a series
of electrodes maintained alternately as cathodes and 
anodes. Again, there is no suggestion that the total
coulombic charge input can be reduced.WO 92/22688 describes a method of electrochemical
roughening an aluminum metal sheet for use as a
lithographic plate support
