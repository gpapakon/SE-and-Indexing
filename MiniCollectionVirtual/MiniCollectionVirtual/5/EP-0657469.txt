<ABSTRACT>
The present invention discloses the cleavage sequence within L-selectin 
that becomes cleaved during neutrophil activation/stimulation. A previously 

unidentified approximately 6 kd L-selectin species, which remains associated 
with the activated/stimulated neutrophil, is also described. Based on these 

observation, the present invention provides methods of detecting L-selectin 
cleavage and methods of reducing the severity of biological responses 

associated with L-selectin cleavage.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of inflammation and anti-inflammation 
therapy. The present invention further relates to methods of 
modulating responses which are associated with L-selectin mediated neutrophil 
attachment and migration. Leukocyte localization to sites of inflammation is a precisely 
coordinated multistep process involving distinct families of adhesion receptors 
and chemokines (Butcher, E. C., Cell 67:1033-1036 (1991), Springer, T. A., 
Nature 346:425-434 (1990)). Regulation of the neutrophil adhesive state is 
critical for leukocyte function. One major neutrophil adhesion molecule, the 
Mac-1 b2 integrin (CD11b/CD18), is both quantitatively upregulated (Bainton, 
D. F. et al., J. Exp. Med. 166:1641-1653 (1987), Todd, R. F. III, et al., J. 
Clin. Invest. 74:1280-1290 (1984)) and assumes an active conformation upon 
neutrophil exposure to chemotactic factors (Buyon, J. P. et al., J. Immunol. 
140:3156-3160 (1988)). In contrast, another major neutrophil adhesion 
molecule, L-selectin, is rapidly down regulated upon neutrophil activation 
(Berg, M. et al., Blood 76:2381-2388 (1990); Griffin, J. D. et al., J. 
Immunol. 145:576-584 (1990); Jutila, M. A. et al., J. Immunol. 143:3318-3324 
(1989); Kishimoto, T. K. et al., Science 245:1238-1241 (1989)). 
However antibodies against either Mac-1 or L-selectin are effective in blocking  
 
neutrophil recruitment to sites of inflammation in vivo (Jutila, M. A. et al., J. 
Immunol. 143:3318-3324 (1989); Lewinsohn, D. M. et al., J. Immunol. 
138:4313-4321 (1987); Rosen, H. et al., J. Exp. Med. 166:1685-1701 (1987); 
Watson, S. R. et al., Nature 349:164-167 (1991)) and neutrophil adhesion to 
stimulated endothelial cells in vitro (Hallmann, R. et al., Biochem. Biophys. 
Res. Commun. 174:236-243 (1991); Harlan, J. M. et al., Blood 66:167-178 
(1985); Kishimoto, T. K. et al., Blood 78:805-811 (1991); Smith, C. W. et 
al., J. Clin. Invest. 87:609-618 (1991); Smith, C. W. et al., J. Clin. Invest. 
83:2008-2017 (1989); Spertini, O. et al., J. Immunol. 147:2565-2573 (1991); 
Zimmerman, G. A. et al., J. Clin. Invest.81:531-537 (1988)). The 
observation that L-selectin and Mac-1 are inversely regulated upon activation 
provided the theoretical basis for a model of neutrophil-endothelial cell 
interaction (Kishimoto, T. K. et al., Science 245:1238-1241 (1989)), where 
L-selectin is involved in the early adhesion events, while Mac-1 is required for 
adhesion strengthening and transendothelial migration. The requirement for 
L-selectin in neutrophil
