<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and a device for limiting the rate of current decrease at switch-off of semiconductor power switches (2) with MOS control input (G). According to the invention, at switch-off a countervoltage (uLE) which is fed back to a gate emitter voltage (UGE) present across the semiconductor power switch (2) is generated as a function of an inductance (38). This feedback thus raises the gate-emitter voltage (uGE) as a result of which the switch-off rate is effectively reduced without delay without increasing the storage time of the semiconductor power switch (2) or influencing the switch-on behaviour.
