<ABSTRACT>
The digital input (3) is intended for a device for the detection of a digital signal when a particular event occurs in a process. Said digital input (3) can advantageously be used in a distribution network for electrical power, in the case of which the particular event initiates the operation of a switching device. The digital input has two first electrical connections (10, 11) to which direct current is applied from an external voltage source. Two second electrical connections (13, 14) are connected to a transmitter element (12), for example an auxiliary contact of the switching device, which emits the digital signal when the particular event occurs. A circuit which carries the digital signal to an optocoupler (22), which provides DC isolation, is also connected to the two second electrical connections (13, 14). The digital input (4) furthermore has a device (15) for converting the direct current, which is supplied from the exterior, into direct current which is DC-isolated from it. This device is operatively connected on the input side to the two first electrical connections (11, 12) and on the output side to the signal circuit. In contrast to digital inputs according to the prior art, only signal currents are supplied via the two second electrical connections (13, 14). In consequence, only very simple protective measures need be taken against the electrical and electromagnetic interference level on these electrical connections (13, 14).
