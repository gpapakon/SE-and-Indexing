<DESCRIPTION>
Our invention relates to devices for magnetically 
treating fluids. Empirical effects of magnetic treatments on 
a variety of fluids are well known, and the treatments have 
proven useful for purposes ranging from inhibiting mineral 
deposition to enhancing combustion. Although exact chemical mechanisms through which 
magnetic treatments produce changes in fluids do not appear 
to be completely understood, the changes are readily 
reproducible by known magnetic conditioning devices. Some of 
these devices use permanent magnets and others use 
electromagnets for producing magnetic fields. Conduits carry 
the fluids across magnetic field lines generated by the 
magnets. Thus, in addition to exposing the fluids to 
magnetic fields and thereby affecting magnetic dipoles in the 
fluids, the devices also provide relative motions between the 
fluids and magnetic fields, which induce electric fields in 
the fluids. Recently, efforts have been made to increase the 
effectiveness of magnetic conditioning devices and to expand 
the kinds of benefits that can be obtained from magnetically 
treating fluids. For example, U.S. Patent 4,659,479 to 
Stickler et al. discloses an electromagnetic water treating 
device that provides for inhibiting formation of scale and 
growth of algae, for eliminating taste and odor from water, 
and for providing corrosion protection. Improved 
efficiencies are obtained by circulating the water along a  
 
helical path that crosses magnetic lines of force at more 
points and at angles approaching ninety degrees. The helical 
path is defined by a baffle that also increases velocity of 
the water without diminishing its overall time of exposure to 
the magnetic fields. Another magnetic conditioning device using a 
helical circulation of fluid for improving efficiencies is 
disclosed in US-A-4,772,387 to Simoni. However, 
instead of using a baffle to circulate the fluid, opposite 
ends of Simoni's conditioner include lateral openings to 
induce a helical flow path with a relatively small pitch. 
Variations in flow rate are accommodated by selectively 
connecting two or more conditioners in series. US-A-4,568,901 issued to one of the 
inventors named jointly herein, and which has been taken 
as the closest prior art, discloses an arrangement of 
permanent magnets that provides for focusing magnetic field 
energy within a conduit. The permanent magnets are 
encapsulated within a polypropylene casing that surrounds the 
conduit. Like magnetic poles of the magnets face the 
conduit, producing
