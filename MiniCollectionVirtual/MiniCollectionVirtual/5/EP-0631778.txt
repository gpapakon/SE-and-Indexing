<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical 
preparation comprising L-aspartate (hereinafter "ASP") 
or L-asparagine (hereinafter "ASN") and a process for 
the preparation thereof. More particularly, the 
invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition of ASP 
or ASN for use in adding to foods, food additives, soft 
drinks, vitamins, an ASP compound or an ASN compound, a 
method of administering about 0.001-0.4 g/Kg/day of ASP 
or ASN to a human for preventing ethanol toxicity, and 
a process for the preparation of such compositions. Both ASP and ASN have been obtained from natural 
substances or synthetic methods. It has been previously 
disclosed in the art that such ASP or ASN is widely used 
as a food additive, being added in small amounts. 
However, ASP or ASN is unknown to prevent ethanol 
toxicity by administering a large amount thereof to a 
human. There have been suggestions of means for 
stimulating ethanol oxidation or blocking the cellular 
toxicity of ethanol. For example, fructose has long 
been suggested to have the potential to stimulate  
 
ethanol oxidation by the following mechanism: fructose 
is first converted to fructose 1-phosphate via the 
action of fructokinase with the simultaneous conversion 
of ATP to ADP, which is transported into the 
mitochondria, where it stimulates oxygen uptake and the 
reoxidation of NADH (Crownover et al., 1986, Scholz & 
Nohl 1976, Ylikari et al. 1971). But as to the 
efficiency of the fructose effect on ethanol oxidation, 
there is still dispute (Berry & Hun 1978). In another instance, an imidazodiazepine compound 
R015-4513 (ethyl 8-azido-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo[1,5-1][1,4]bensodiazepine-3-carboxylate) 
has 
been reported to function as a specific alcohol 
antagonist (Lister & Nutt 1987, Hoffman et al. 1987). 
The specific biochemical role of R015-4513 was noticed 
from its activity in reversing ethanol's stimulatory 
effect on GABA-mediated Cl⁻ flux in synaptosomes (Suzdak 
et al. 1986). A curative effect on ethanol-induced 
behavioral derangements has been observed for R015-4513. 
However, the toxic effects of R015-4513 still limit its 
general application (Corda et al. 1989). In addition, 
GABA antagonists, serotonin uptake inhibitors, α-adrenoceptor 
antagonists, lithium, caffeine, Thyroid 
Hormone Releasing Hormone (TRH) and hyperbaric oxygen 
have been reported to have the potential to reverse (at 
least in part) some of the behavioral effects of ethanol 
(Lister & Nutt 1987, Judd & Huey 1984, Mezey 1976, 
Nuotto et al.
