<ABSTRACT>
A magnetooptic disk player records and/or reproduces 
the information of a magnetooptic disk loaded into a disk 

cartridge (1,1') using an optical pickup and a magnetic 
head (30). The apparatus loads and unloads the 

magnetooptic disk cartridge (1,1') on a deck using a 
mechanism. However, when a recordable magnetooptic disk 

cartridge is loaded and unloaded, or is inserted and drawn 
out, the magnetic head is completely protected from damage 

by the use of a head ascending support (100).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magnetooptic recording and
reproducing apparatus which records information by projecting a focused
optical beam on a recording medium and simultaneously applying a magnetic
field to the recording medium and reproduces information recorded on the
medium, and more particularly, to a portable magnetooptic disk player which
uses a magnetooptic disk cartridge in which a magnetooptic disk is rotatably
received.Generally, a magnetooptic disk has record layers in which desired
information is recorded and the recorded information is reproduced using a
magnetooptic disk player which has an optical pickup for the projecting of a
focused optical beam and a bias magnet for applying a magnetic field. The
record layers, for example, are composed of a magnetic material, such as
TbFe or TbFeCo. This magnetooptic disk is received in a caddy to form a
disk cartridge so that the disk is loaded in a disk drive together with the
caddy.Recently, a magnetooptic disk cartridge called a "minidisk" (64mm
diameter) was placed on the market by Sony (Registered Trade Mark), and
the development of suitable players therefor has progressed actively. There
are two types of currently available minidisks: a recordable type shown in
Figures 1A and 1B and a reproduction-only type shown in Figures 2A and 2B.Referring to Figures 1A and 1B, the recordable minidisk 1 has a
cartridge cell 2 having two openings 3 and 4 at the both sides thereof and a
shutter 5 which moves along a sliding groove 6 so as to open and close 
openings 3 and 4. Both sides of a disk 9 in cartridge cell 2 are exposed
through openings 3 and 4.In Figures 2A and 2B, the reproduction-only minidisk 1' has a
cartridge cell 2' having an opening only on one side thereof and a shutter 5'
which moves along a sliding groove 6' so as to open and close opening 3'.
Thus, only the one side of disk 9' is exposed through opening 3'.Arrows 7 and 7' on the upper surface of cartridge cell 2 and 2' of
minidisks 1 and 1' each depict the direction of insertion into a player.
Recording and reproducing detection grooves 8 and 8' each having different
depth are formed on the lower surface of cartridge cell 2 and 2', so that it can
be determined whether an inserted minidisk is a recordable type or a
reproduction-only type. Loading grooves 10 and 10' are provided at the right
and left sides of the lower surface of cartridge cells 2 and 2'. A plurality of
cartridge loading grooves 11 and 11' for loading the disk cartridge into a deck
are provided on the lower

<CLAIMS>
A magnetooptic disk player having a cartridge holder (20) into which
a magnetooptic disk cartridge (1,1') is insertable, a magnetic head (30) which

substantially contacts, in use, a magnetooptic disk inside an inserted
magnetooptic disk cartridge (1,1'), and a deck (110) onto which the

magnetooptic disk cartridge (1,1') is loadable, wherein said magnetooptic disk
player further comprises:


a head supporting member (32) on which said magnetic head (30) is
installed and which, in use, can ascend and descend so that the magnetic head

(30) substantially makes contact with the magnetooptic disk; and
head ascending support means installed on said cartridge holder (20),
for lifting the head supporting member (32) in the state where the cartridge

holder (20) is open and lowering the head supporting member in the state
where the cartridge holder is closed;

   characterised in that said head ascending support means comprises:

a supporting portion (107') formed on the cartridge holder (20);
a head ascending support member (100) rotatably coupled to the
supporting portion (107'), for lifting and lowering said head supporting

member (32); and 
a spring (103) for elastically biasing the head ascending support
member (100) toward a position where said head supporting member (32) is

lifted.
A magnetooptic disk player as claimed in claim 1, wherein said head
ascending support member (100) comprises:


a contacting portion (106) formed at one side of head ascending support
member (100) for making contact with the deck (110) by the rotation of the

cartridge holder (20) to move said head ascending support member toward a
position where the head supporting member (32) is lowered; and
a head supporting member contacting portion (105) formed at the other
side of the head ascending support member (100), for contacting the head

supporting member (32).
A magnetooptic disk player as claimed in claim 1, wherein said spring
(103) is constructed such that one end of the spring is connected to the

cartridge holder (20), the center portion thereof is attached about the rotational axis of the
head ascending support member (100), and the other end thereof is connected

to the head ascending support member (100).
A magnetooptic disk player as claimed in claim 2 or 3, wherein said
magnetooptic disk player further comprises a plate spring (102) installed on

the deck (110) for contacting said contacting portion (106) and thereby
guiding the movement of the head ascending support means (32). 
A magnetooptic disk player which comprises a cartridge holder (20)
into which a magnetooptic disk cartridge (1) is insertable, a magnetic head (30)

which substantially contacts, in use, a magnetooptic disk inside an inserted
magnetooptic disk cartridge (1), and a deck (110) onto which the

magnetooptic disk cartridge (1) is loadable, wherein said magnetooptic disk
player further comprises:


a head supporting member (32) for supporting said magnetic head (30)
and which, in use, can ascend and descend so that the magnetic head (30) substantially

makes contact with the magnetooptic disk;
a sliding member (80) installed on said cartridge holder, and which can
be pushed by the inserted magnetooptic disk cartridge and then restored to an

initial state; and
a head ascending support means installed on the sliding member (80),
for lifting the head supporting member (32) in the state where said cartridge

holder (20) is open and for lowering the head supporting member (32) in the
state where the cartridge holder (20) is closed;

   characterised in that said head ascending support means comprises:

a supporting portion (107) formed on the sliding member (80);
a head ascending support member (100) rotatably coupled to said

A magnetooptic disk player as claimed in claim 5, wherein said head
ascending support member (100) comprises:


a contacting portion (106) formed at one side of the head ascending
support member (100) for making contact with the deck (110) by the rotation
