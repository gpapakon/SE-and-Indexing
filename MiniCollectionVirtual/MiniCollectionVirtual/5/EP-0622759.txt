<ABSTRACT>
A molded plastic printer carriage (10) mountable in the 
printer on a pair of slider rods (SF,SR) uses a pair of spaced 

front bushings (80,82) and single rear bushing (70) positioned 
on a line intermediate the two front bushings (80,82). The rear bushing 

(70) is eccentricly spring biased in a direction away from the front 
bushings (80,82) and each bushing has two line contacts with the slider 

rod on which it is mounted, the first of the line contacts being 
at the top of the bushing and the second being on the side of the 

bushing substantially facing the opposite slider rod. The 
eccentric spring biasing and the two line contact configuration 

of the bushings prevents rotation of the carriage around the 
slider rods during rapid movement thereof during printing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a carriage pre-load 
support and bushing system for a large scale computer driven 
plotter carriage which slides back and forth transversely of the 
path of paper travel through the plotter on a pair of smooth 
support rods which are ordinarily cylindrical. Carriage bushing systems require high tolerance and low 
friction and have inherently conflicting design requirements 
since high tolerance bushing systems require dimensionally 
stable materials which usually have high coefficients of 
friction. Conversely, a bushing system which is constructed 
primarily of lubricous material for reduced friction tends to be 
dimensionally unstable. The problem is compounded with 
increasing size of the printer or plotter. Low friction bushings 
can be manufactured to the required tolerances by secondary 
machining operations with repeated inspections and rejection of 
bushings that are not manufactured to the correct tolerance. 
Clearly, such operations materially increase the per part 
finished cost. A carriage support system which can be manufactured to  
 
and retain close tolerances is therefore required for large scale 
plotter carriages such as for drafting plotters which must move 
without impediment at a high rate of speed with frequent 
reversals in the direction of movement along the slider rods. The present invention provides a printer carriage 
comprising a frame having a plurality of print cartridge 
receptacles and a support system thereon, said support system 
comprising a front slider rod channel, a pair of bushings in said 
front slider rod channel for supporting said carriage for sliding 
movement on a front carriage slider rod, a rear slider rod 
bushing mounted on said carriage for supporting said carriage for 
sliding movement on a rear carriage slider rod, means for 
resiliently biasing said rear bushing in a direction away from 
said front bushings, said front and rear bushings each having 
first and second arcuately spaced contact surfaces for contacting 
the respective slider rods-along two spaced parallel lines, said 
first contact surfaces on each bushing being proximate a top 
center portion thereof and said second contact surfaces of said 
front bushings substantially facing said second contact surface 
of said rear bushing. Figure 1 is a plan view of a plotter carriage 
incorporating the teachings of the present invention. Figure 2 is a side elevation of the carriage of Fig. 
1. Figures 3A and 3B respectively show enlarged side

A printer carriage (10) comprising a frame having 
a plurality of print cartridge receptacles and a support system 

thereon, said support system comprising a front slider rod 
channel (84), a pair of bushings (80, 82) in said front slider 

rod channel for supporting said carriage for sliding movement on 
a front carriage slider rod (SF), a rear slider rod bushing (70) 

mounted on said carriage for supporting said carriage for sliding 
movement on a rear carriage slider rod (SR), means (106) for 

resiliently biasing said rear bushing (70) in a direction away 
from said front bushings (80, 82), said front and rear bushings 

each having first and second arcuately spaced contact surfaces 
(90, 92; 94, 96) for contacting the respective slider rods along 

two spaced parallel lines (L2, L3; L4, L5), said first contact 
surfaces (90, 94) on each bushing being proximate a top center 

portion thereof and said second contact surfaces (92) of said 
front bushings substantially facing said second contact surface 

(94) of said rear bushing. 
The carriage of claim 1, wherein said front 
bushings are positioned at opposite ends of said front slider rod 

channel. 
The carriage of claim 1, wherein said front 
bushings (80, 82) have a first common centerline and said rear 

bushing (70) has a second centerline parallel to said first 
centerline, said first contact surfaces being located above said 

centerlines and said second contact surface of said rear bushing 
being located below said centerlines. 
The carriage of claim 3, wherein said biasing means 
comprising a spring (106) which biases said rear bushing along 

a line eccentric to the axis of said rear bushing above said 
first and second centerlines. 
The carriage of claim 4, further comprising a slot 
(60) in said frame and a support wing (74) and strut (72) on said  

 
rear bushing, said rear bushing being supported on said frame by 

said wing which guides said bushing for longitudinal movement in 
said slot, and said spring comprising a compression spring (106) 

seated between said frame and said bushing. 
The carriage of claim 5, wherein said bushings are 
split bushings. 
The carriage of claim 6, wherein said bushings are 
sintered bronze. 
The carriage of claim 6, wherein said bushings are 
a mixture of nylon 6/6, polytetrafluorine plastic and carbon 

fiber. 
The carriage of claim 1, wherein said frame is 
molded plastic.
