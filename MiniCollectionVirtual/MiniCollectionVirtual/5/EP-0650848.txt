<ABSTRACT>
A printer/plotter having a carriage (50) for 
rem
ovably mounting a plurality of printheads, with one 
type of printhead (64) such as a wider swath higher 

resolution black inkjet cartridge having one type of 
electrical interconnect and another type of printhead 

(40) such as a narrower swath lower resolution color 
inkjet cartridge having a different type of electrical 

interconnect. The carriage includes differently 
configured flex-circuit conductive assemblies (62; 

54,56,58) for each different type of electrical 
interconnect without having to change the datum 

configuration of the cartridges mounted in the carriage.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to printers/plotters, and
more specifically to print carriages having inkjet print cartridges
removably mounted thereon.It is common to have several inkjet print cartridges in a
single carriage of an inkjet printer. But in some instances these
cartridges may have different capabilities and therefore have
different electrical interconnect designs connecting the cartridges
to the printer. For example, the number and pattern of electrical
contacts may differ between the different types of cartridges, such
as in cartridges which have different print resolutions, see e.g.
EP-A-492 955.Many multi-pen set printers have addressed the issue of
improving output quality and the speed of output without increasing
the resolution of the entire pen set and thus their cost and
complexity. Some have improved output quality through improved
addressability and some through improved printing algorithms. In
such cases the improved output quality is not as good as the output
quality from the higher resolution pen of the multi-resolution pen
set. Typically in inkjet printers, one print cartridge is black,
another is a tri-compartment color cartridge, or a separate color
cartridge is provided for each color component (e.g., cyan,
magenta, yellow). The different types of nozzle arrays and
differently designed color and black print cartridges, as well as
other unique printhead characteristics all create the need for an
inexpensive but reliable way to successfully mount such different
cartridges into the same carriage.A principal object of the invention is to incorporate
printheads having different types of electrical interconnects into
the same carriage in order to expand the capabilities of the
printer to achieve high quality printing as well as greater
throughput. A related object is to decrease research and
development costs as well as decrease the time for bringing higher
resolution printers to market.It is a primary object of the invention to adapt a print
carriage for removably mounting differently configured print
cartridges at the same time in the same carriage without having to
change the datum configuration for the print cartridges.Another object is to provide a modified interconnect scheme
for a carriage mounted flex-circuit member having an increased
number of conductive pads spread over an enlarged area without
having to change the size of the carriage chute for receiving a
print cartridge. A related object is to provide a simplified 
unitary resilient member made of foam or the like

<CLAIMS>
A printer/plotter (10) with a carriage for removably mounting at the same time a
plurality of printheads, comprising:


a frame for holding media (14) in a print zone;
a carriage (50) movably supported on said frame for traversal over said print zone
along a horizontal carriage axis;
a first printhead (64) having first electrical interconnect means (52) for receiving a
first set of print activation signals;
a second printhead (40) having a second electrical interconnect means (42) for
receiving a second set of print activation signals;
means for mounting said first and second printheads on said carriage in adjacent
first and second carriage chutes along said carriage axis, for printing by said first and

second printhead of respective horizontal swaths on the media in said print zone, said
mounting means further including:
a first conductive assembly within said first chute for mechanically and electrically
engaging said first electrical interconnect means, said first conductive assembly including:
a first array of conductive pads (62) matching said first electrical interconnect
means and
first resilient means (84) extending from a first recess or aperture within said first
chute and coextensive with said first array for maintaining a pressurized interconnection

with said first electrical interconnect means when said first printhead is mounted in said
first chute, and
a second conductive assembly within said second chute for mechanically and
electrically engaging said second electrical interconnect means through a second recess or

aperture in said carriage, said second conductive assembly including a second array of
conductive pads (74) matching all of said second electrical interconnect means but not

matching all of said first electrical interconnect means, and second resilient means (76,78)
extending from a second recess or aperture within said second chute and coextensive with

said second array for maintaining a pressurized interconnection with said second electrical 
interconnect means when said second printhead is mounted in said second chute,

wherein
said first and second printhead each have a same external size and a same external
datum configuration (65,67,69),
said adjacent carriage chutes each have a same predetermined chute width along
said carriage axis,
said first array covers a larger area than said second array, and
said first array has a greater number of columns of conductive pads along said
carriage axis than said second array.
A printer/plotter according to claim 1 wherein said first type of printhead includes a
black printhead and said second type of printhead includes a color printhead.
A printer/plotter according to claim 2 wherein said color printhead generates a color
component selected from cyan, magenta, yellow, red, green and blue.
A printer/plotter according to any preceding claim wherein said first type of printhead
has a wider printing swath in a direction normal to said carriage axis than said second

printhead.
A printer/plotter according to any preceding claim wherein said first type of printhead
has a higher resolution than said second printhead.
A printer/plotter according to any preceding claim wherein said second type of
printhead includes three adjacent color printheads each associated with a different color

component, and any two adjacent ones of the first and second types of printheads have a
same center-to-center spacing.
A printer/plotter according to any preceding claim wherein said first resilient means is
different in construction and operation from said second resilient means, said first resilient

means includes foam means (84) for operatively engaging said first electrical interconnect
means, and said second resilient means includes metal spring means (78) for operatively

engaging said second electrical interconnect means.
