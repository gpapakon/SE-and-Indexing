<ABSTRACT>
An air-fuel ratio control system for an internal 
combustion engine controls an amount of fuel supplied 

to the engine. Operating conditions of the engine, 
including engine rotational speed and intake pressure, 

are detected. Also detected is a valve opening of a 
recirculation control valve arranged in an exhaust 

recirculation passage, for controlling recirculation of 
exhaust gases. An amount of recirculation gas is 

determined based on a detected value of the valve 
opening of the recirculation control valve. A fuel 

supply amount is calculated based on the engine 
rotational speed and the intake pressure. The fuel 

supply amount is corrected based on the amount of 
recirculation gas determined.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an air-fuel ratio
control system for an internal combustion engine having
an exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system, and more
particularly to an air-fuel ratio control system of
this kind, which is adapted to correct the air-fuel
(A/F) ratio of a mixture supplied to the engine while
recirculation of exhaust gases (EGR) is carried out by
the exhaust gas recirculation system.In prior art, an air-fuel ratio control system
has been proposed by the present assignee in Japanese
Provisional Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 5-187288
(corresponding to U.S. Patent No. 5,261,370), which is
adapted to correct the amount of fuel to be supplied to
the engine by a correction amount for use in the air-fuel
ratio control, which is determined based on the
engine rotational speed and load on the engine, while
recirculation of exhaust gases is carried out by an
exhaust gas recirculation system.According to the proposed conventional system,
the amount of fuel to be supplied to the engine is
corrected by an amount of exhaust gases passed through
a recirculation control valve of the exhaust gas
recirculation system, which amount is estimated based
on the correction amount for use in the air-fuel ratio
control. The system contemplates response delay of the 
recirculation control valve and dynamic characteristics of
recirculation gas. However, the amount of recirculation gas
is not determined based on a detected value of valve opening
of the recirculation control valve. As a result, the
corrected fuel supply amount can cause undesired variations
in the air-fuel ratio due to variations in operating
characteristics between individual exhaust gas recirculation
control valves to be used or aging of one used in the
system, resulting in degraded exhaust emission
characteristics.Further, according to the proposed system the valve opening
of the recirculation control valve is controlled based on
the aforementioned correction amount. However, the response
delay of the recirculation control valve and the dynamic
characteristics of recirculation gas are not taken into
account in controlling the valve opening, which also causes
variation in the air-fuel ratio, resulting in degraded
emission characteristics.EP-A-539 241 discloses calculating a required recirculation
gas amount based on the EGR coefficient KEGR and the dead
time, and calculating the actual recirculation gas amount
based on the EGR direct supply ratio, the EGR carry-off
ratio and the required recirculationg gas amount. The actual
valve opening value of
