<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a plate type heat transfer device which has a number of rectangular or oval cavities (or cells) in its cross-section, charged with a certain amount of a working fluid in each of the cavities (or cells) where heat from the lower surface of the plate is transferred to the upper surface of the heat transfer device. Therefore, the plate type heat transferred device has a wide range of application such as for the stabilization or protection of foundation for pipelines, roads, airport runway, structures etc. by keeping the foundation intact in extremely cold regions, or to the ceilings or floors of relatively large spaces, such as office buildings, manufacturing factories, storage buildings, or even to the roofs of refrigerator cars where the temperature control is required.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a plate type heat transfer device which comprises 
of a parallel arrangement of a number of long cavities with rectangular or oval 
cross-section. A certain amount of a working fluid is charged in each of the 
cavities as the heat transfer medium. This plate can be operated as a thermal 
diode or uni-directional thermosyphon in a thickness direction of the plate. The principle of this invention is that the fluid in the lower part of the 
cavities is vaporized by. heat conducted through the lower surface of the beat 
transfer device. The vapor which moves up to the upper part of the cavities is 
then condensed by cooling at the upper surface of the heat transfer device and 
consequently the latent heat of vaporization is transferred to the outside through 
the upper surface of the cavities. 
Heat is, therefore, transferred from the lower surface of the cavities by the 
evaporation of the working fluid to the upper surface of the cavities by the 
condensation of the. vapor in the presence of gravity. Since heat can not be 
transferred from the upper surface of the heat transfer device to the lower surface 
of the device, it can act as a thermal diode. When the fluid is condensed, it flows down along the walls of the cavities 
to the lower part of the cavities in the presence of a force field such as gravity 
because the density of the liquid phase of the working fluid is heavier than that 
of the vapor phase of the working fluid. Therefore, when the plate type heat transfer device produced according to 
the present invention is installed in a place, heat is transferred only from the 
lower side to the upper side of the device and can not be transferred effectively  
 
in the reverse direction. The heat transfer mechanism in the present invention employing the latent 
heat of vaporization of a working fluid is similar to that of the thermosyphon as 
described in U.S. Patent 2,350,348. However, because the structure of the heat transfer device by the present 
invention is quite different from that of the thermosyphon, the heat transfer route 
is different from that of the conventional thermosyphon. Conventional 
thermosyphons are made from tubings which have a relatively small area in the 
direction of heat flow due to the small diameter of the tubings used. In such 
conventional thermosyphons, heat is transferred into the tube through the side 
wall of the lower part of the tube containing the fluid and heat is removed 
through the side wall of the condensing part located in the
