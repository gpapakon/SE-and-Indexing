<ABSTRACT>
A communications switch (311) communicates a message to a particular 
access network 

endpoint 
 by 
forwarding an identification of that endpoint 

along with the message, link-by-link, through the access network, the forwarding 
being accomplished by using previously stored routing information identifying, at 

the switch and at each cross-connection point (350, 370), a particular downstream 
link over which the endpoint can ultimately be reached. The links (345, 365) 

connecting the cross-connection points are time-division-multiplexed links 

supporting digital loop carrier and fiber-in-the-loop communications. The routing 
information is generated and stored automatically by having each network element 

report information about itself upstream into the network.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to telecommunications systems and, in 
particular, to communications access networks including, for example, the telephone 
local loop plant. The access network interconnecting, for example, a telephone central 
office and terminal equipment at customer premises locations is conventionally 
referred to as the "local loop plant." This network is comprised, for each connection 
or "local loop," of a series of local loop segments extending from within the central 
office through various cross-connection elements to endpoints connected to the 
customer premises locations. In strictly-wire-pair-based arrangements, these cross-connection 
elements typically include the main distributing frame within the central 
office building; one or more feeder/distribution interfaces (FDIs), typically housed in 
grade-level pedestal cabinets or huts, or in subterranean vaults; and a serving 
terminal, typically housed in an enclosure mounted on a utility pole, or on or within 
a building, and serving as the point from which extend wire "drop pairs," or "drops," 
serving perhaps a half-dozen customers. Administrative database systems are used 
by the local telephone companies to maintain detailed data for each local loop, 
specifying all of its wire pairs so that telephone craftpersons can, for example, 
a) identify which wire pairs between any two cross-connection elements are 
available for use as additional local loops are added, and b) troubleshoot reported 
local loop failures. The process of provisioning new wire-pair-based local loops and 
performing maintenance on the existing local loops is an expensive one. The 
principal source of expense is the labor cost associated with the need for craftpersons 
to make manual cross-connections in the FDIs and serving terminals, along with the 
travel time. In turn, a major part of this labor cost arises out of the fact that a not-insignificant 
portion of the administrative database data is inaccurate, leading to 
mistakes and re-works in the course of a) provisioning new local loops, and b) de-provisioning 
of no-longer-needed, existing loops. The data inaccuracies can arise in 
many ways. For example, incorrect data may be reported from the field, as happens 
when the wire pairs used to establish local loop connections are mis-reported. Or, 
the data may be inaccurately entered by clerks to whom the craftpersons report the 
data. At some point, the overall level of inaccuracy in the databases becomes so 
great that the telephone company has
