<ABSTRACT>
In a manual device for transferring a film, such as a cover-up film or an adhesive film, from a backing strip (3) onto a substrate, a longitudinally divided housing (1) is provided, in which a supply spool (2) is mounted with a coil of film-coated backing strip (3) which is guided from said spool via an applicator foot (4), protruding out of the housing (1), is deflected at said foot and conducted by it back into the housing (1) onto a winding spool (5). When the housing is open, the supply spool (2) and the winding spool (5) can be removed from or placed in the housing (1). In this case, the applicator foot (4) can be displaced from its position protruding out of the housing (1) into a position retracted into the housing (1) and can be releasably locked in its extended position protruding out of the housing.

A hand-held device for transferring a film from a 
carrier tape (3) to a substrate, comprising a longitudinally 

divided housing (1,1') with an applicator foot (4) in 
which is mounted a supply spool (2) with a roll of film-coated 

carrier tape (3) which is guided from the supply 
spool over the applicator foot (4) projecting from the 

housing (1,1'), reversed at the applicator foot (4) and 
returned therefrom to a wind-on spool (5) in the housing 

(1,1'), the arrangement being such that, when the housing 
(1,1') is open, the supply spool (2) and the wind-on spool 

(5) can be respectively removed from the housing (1,1') and 
inserted therein, characterized in that the applicator foot 

(4) is displaceable from its position projecting from the 
housing (1,1') into a position w
ithdrawn into the housing 
(1,1') and is designed to be releasably locked in its 

projecting, extended position. 
A hand-held device as claimed in claim 1, characterized 
in that the applicator foot (4) is automatically 

locked when it is moved into its extended position. 
A hand-held device as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the applicator foot (4) can only be unlocked 

in its extended position and/or can only be moved 
into its retracted position when the housing (1,1') is 

open. 
A hand-held device as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the applicator foot (4) is fixed to 

a slide (7) designed to travel along and to engage form-lockingly 
with a guide rail (11) in the form of a shaped 

rail arranged in one half of the housing. 
A hand-held device as claimed in claim 4, characterized 
in that the shaped rail is in the form of a T-shaped 

guide rail (11) which is fixed to and preferably 
integral with the side wall (14) of the associated housing 

half (1).  
 
A hand-held device as claimed in claim 4 or 5, characterized 
in that the slide (7) has two spring arms (12) 

which are arranged on either side of the guide rail (11) 
and which enter into form-locking engagement with locking 

elements (9;11) arranged on the housing (1) when the 
applicator foot (4) reaches one of its two end positions. 
A hand-held device as claimed in claim 6, characterized 
in that the applicator foot (4), the slide (7) and 

the spring arms (12) together form an integral element. 
A hand-held device as claimed in any of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the opened housing (1) has a construction 

which is symmetrical to a longitudinal centre 
line (M-M), the applicator foot (4) being displaceable 

along the line of symmetry (M-M). 
A hand-held device as claimed in any of claims 6 to 8, 
characterized in that, at their ends, both spring arms (12) 

have an actuating section (8) which projects laterally 
towards the removable housing half (1') and by means of 

which they can be disengaged from the locking elements 
(9;10). 
A hand-held device as claimed in any of claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that the applicator foot (4) is designed 

to spring out. 
A hand-held device as claimed in any of claims 1 to 
10, characterized in that a stop (16) for limiting the 

displacement of the applicator foot (4) into the housing 
(1) is provided.
