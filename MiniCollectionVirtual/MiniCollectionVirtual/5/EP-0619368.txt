<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to concentrated liquid detergent 
compositions which contain a suspending solid peroxygen 
compound. Answering the long-felt need for aqueous liquid detergent 
compositions containing a peroxygen bleach, which would be 
stable and efficient at the same time, EP-A-293 040 
and EP-A-294 904 have described aqueous detergent 
compositions having a pH above 8 containing an anionic 
surfactant at conventional levels, i.e. above 5% by weight, 
typically from 15% to 40% by weight, and a solid water 
soluble peroxygen bleach, suspended in a specific 
water/solvent medium. In such compositions, particular attention had to be 
given to the physical stability of suspended particles in the 
liquid medium. One option is represented by EP-A-0 430 330, 
describing liquid detergent compositions in which solid  
 
particles, in particular particles of a peroxygen compound, 
are suspended by means of a structured phase (surfactant 
"neat phase"). Surfactant structured (neat) phases are known as means to 
suspend solid particles such as zeolites in liquid detergent 
compositions, see in particular EP-A-79 646, EP-A- 170 091 
and EP-A-295 021. In bleach-containing liquid detergent compositions, 
chemical stability also represents an important concern, and 
high level of organic solvents should in principle be 
necessary, in order to achieve an optimal chemical stability. 
However, organic solvents at high levels have been found to 
have a detrimental effect on the formulation of surfactant 
neat phases, so that a good compromise between chemical and 
physical stability when using structured phases to suspend a 
peroxygen bleach compound was not easy to obtain. The problem is especially acute in the case of 
percarbonate, which is more difficult to stabilize chemically 
than perborate. The present invention provides concentrated liquid 
detergent compositions formulated as a neat phase in which 
solid suspended peroxygen compounds, such as perborate or 
percarbonate, in particular percarbonate, can be stabilized 
chemically and physically. Indeed, the present invention 
provides liquid detergent bleach-containing compositions 
which exhibit a very good chemical stability, and are in the 
form of a perfectly stable structured phase. The present invention relates to a liquid detergent 
composition containing a surface-active agent, water, an  
 
organic solvent, and a solid peroxygen compound in the form 
of suspended particles. Said composition comprises at least 
10% by weight of the total composition
