<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to false twisted combined filament yarn consisting mainly of polyester multifilament yarn 
composed of not less than two kinds of false twisted filament yarn of different cross-sectional shapes at least one kind 

of filament yarn of which has a predetermined non-recess-carrying cross-sectional shape, and the remaining filament 
yarn of which has a predetermined recess-carrying cross-sectional shape, the filament yarn of such cross-sectional 

shapes being combined so that the yarn of respective cross-sectional shapes scatter; a method of manufacturing the 

same false twisted combined filament yarn; and a knitted or woven material using the same yarn. The present invention 
can provide false twisted combined filament yarn capable of producing a knitted or woven material having excellent 

draping characteristics and a dry feel owing to the additional twists, the number of which is smaller than those given to 
conventional false twisted yarn, given to the yarn according to the present invention, as well as a swollen appearance, 

a soft feel and lightness, i.e. a smooth and dry feel which are different from the hard and cool feel of conventional 
hard twist yarn of this kind, and, furthermore, a high water absorption factor; and a woven or knitted material having 

a high water absorption factor.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a combined and multi-component
false-twist textured filament yarn
constituted by at least two kinds of multi-filament
yarns having different sectional shapes and having a
slippery and pliable(sara-sara) feeling, a production
method of such a yarn, and a knitted/woven fabric
having water absorption property.More particularly, the present invention relates
to a combined and multi-component false-twist textured
filament yarn suitable for a woven fabric having a
slippery and pliable(sara-sara) feeling different from
a harsh and stiff(shari) feeling obtained
conventionally by hard twist, and a drape property, to
a production method of the yarn, and to a knitted/
woven fabric having an excellent drape property and a
high water absorption property and equipped with
slippery and pliable(sara-sara) touch which restricts
a wet and gooey(betotsuki) feeling under a water
retention state. Conventionally, polyester multi-filament yarns
have been used unlike other synthetic fibers such as
nylon or acryl because the polyester multi-filament
yarns can impart excellent drape property to a woven
fabric and can express en elegant silhouette
particularly in female dresses.To impart the drape property, hard twist must be
applied to the polyester multi-filament yarn. The
yarn is then woven, and the resulting grey goods is
subjected to alkali weight loss in a dyeing process
and a woven fabric is obtained.The application of hard twist not only imparts
the drape property to a woven fabric but also provides
the effects of eliminating a conventional waxy feeling
of the woven fabric and imparting a dry and harsh and
stiff(shari) feeling. This harsh and stiff(shari)
feeling is different depending on the number of hard
twists and when the number of twists is excessively
great, feeling becomes hard and the woven fabric comes
to have an undesirable hard and sandy(jyari) feeling.When hard twist is applied to the conventional
multi-filament yarn so as to impart the drape property
or the harsh and stiff feeling, the multi-filament
yarns are highly bundled, and the resulting woven 
fabric comes to have a hard feeling not having a puff
property and soft feeling due to the twist structure.
To solve this problem, Japanese Patent Publication
Nos. 19733/1986, 31210/1986 and 61422/1988 propose a
multi-component structure false-twist textured yarn
having a core-sheath two-layered structure by
compositing at least two kinds of multi-filament yarns
having different elongations and drawing and false
twisting them.This
