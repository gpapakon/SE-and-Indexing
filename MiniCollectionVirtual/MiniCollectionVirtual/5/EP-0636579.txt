<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an alumina
composition, alumina molded articles prepared from the
composition, alumina ceramic articles obtainable from the alumina
molded articles, and a process for producing an alumina
ceramic article.With the recent development of electronics industry,
dielectric ceramics has been steadily extending its
application to IC packages, HIC substrates, multi-layer
substrates, etc. The most widespread dielectric ceramics are
alumina ceramics having well-balanced properties, such as
electric properties, mechanical properties, and thermal
properties.Alumina ceramic plates used as various substrates,
for example, are usually produced by calcining an alumina
molded article, called an alumina green sheet, obtained by
tape casting. Tape casting, also called a doctor blade
method, comprises spreading a slurry (alumina composition) of
α-alumina in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid comprising a
solvent, a plasticizer, a binder, etc. on a carrier film from
a knife edge called a doctor and drying the cast slurry to
obtain an alumina green sheet. For the detail of the tape 
casting, reference can be made to Ceramics Kako Handbook
(Ceramics Working Handbook), pp. 122-123, Kensetsu Sangyo
Chosakai (1987).EP-A- 0 188 388 discloses the production of α-alumina consisting
essentially of solid, spherical, non-aggregated particles. EP-A- 0 224 118
describes the production of α-alumina particles. Furthermore, the production
of crystalline alumina particles is disclosed in EP-B- 0 105 025.It is important for alumina ceramics for the above-mentioned
application to have high dimensional precision,
such as low anisotropy of shrinkage and warp resistance on
sintering, as well as high density, mechanical strength,
surface smoothness, and binder removing properties. However,
conventional α-alumina has a broad particle size distribution
and an irregular primary particle shape, failing to provide
uniform alumina molded articles. It has been difficult to
obtain an alumina ceramic plate having excellent dimensional
precision free from anisotropy of shrinkage or warpage from
such α-alumina by the above-mentioned tape casting. It has
therefore been demanded to reduce anisotropy of shrinkage and
warpage on sintering and to improve dimensional precision.Other alumina ceramic products include containers for
physicochemical laboratories or industry (e.g., crucibles),
protective tubing, guide eyes, and bioceramics. These
products are produced by sintering an alumina molded article
(also called an alumina green body)
