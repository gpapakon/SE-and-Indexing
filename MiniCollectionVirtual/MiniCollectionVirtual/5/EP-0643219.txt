<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a fuel feeding system
for an internal combustion engine, and especially to a
fuel injection system suitable for use in a cylinder
injection internal combustion engine to permit injection
of fuel at relatively high fuel pressure.As internal combustion engines of the type that
fuel is injected within each cylinder, that is, as so-called
cylinder injection internal combustion engines
or direct injection internal combustion engines, diesel
engines are known widely. In the field of spark ignition
engines (hereinafter called "gasoline engine" because
spark ignition engines are generally gasoline
engines), those of the cylinder injection type have
also been proposed in recent years.In cylinder injection internal combustion
engines, there is a tendency, with a view toward improving
their performance and also reducing exhaust
gas, to raise the fuel injection pressure so that fuel
can be atomized as very fine droplets and the fuel injection
cycle can be shortened. Further, engines 
equipped with a supercharging system require, upon supercharging,
high fuel injection pressure corresponding
to the pressure of the supercharging.Fuel feeding systems in cylinder injection internal
combustion engines are therefore constructed to
successfully provide such high fuel injection pressure
(for example, several tens atm or so).For example, FIGS. 12 and 13 schematically illustrate
the constructions of fuel feeding systems for
internal combustion engines, which have heretofore been
proposed as fuel feeding systems capable of providing
such high fuel injection pressure.Illustrated in FIGS. 12 and 13 are a fuel injector
1, a fuel tank 2, a fuel line 3 arranged between
the fuel injector 1 and the fuel tank 2, a low-pressure
fuel pump 4 arranged in an upstream portion of the fuel
line 3, said upstream portion being on a side of the
fuel tank 2, and a high-pressure fuel pump 5 arranged
between the low-pressure fuel pump 4 and the fuel injector
1. Also depicted are fuel filters 6,7 arranged
in an inlet portion of the fuel line 3, a check valve
8, a low-pressure regulator 9 as a low-pressure control
means, and a high-pressure regulator 10 as a high-pressure
control means. Further, FIG. 13 also shows a
cylinder 21, a piston 22, a piston rod 22A, a 
crankshaft 23, a combustion chamber 24, a cylinder head
25, an intake passage 26, a spark plug 27, and an exhaust
passage 28.According to each of such fuel feeding systems,
the fuel which has been pressurized to a certain extent
by the low-pressure fuel pump 4 is
