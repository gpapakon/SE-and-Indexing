<ABSTRACT>
Quality of printed images as produced by an ink-jet 
printer (10) is improved by staggering applications of ink 

dots (30) to pixel locations (36) such that overlapping ink 
dots (30) are printed on successive passes of a printhead (16) 

and such that swaths (38) are partially printed on overlapping 
passes of the printhead (16). Quality of multi-colored or 

multi-shaded images is further improved by grouping pixels 
(36) into super pixels (42), and applying various combinations 

of colored ink dots (30) to the various pixels (36) within each 
super pixel (42) in a staggered sequence.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to liquid ink-jet printers 
and, more particularly, to a pattern and sequence for 
depositing ink on a print medium so as to improve the appearance 
of printed images. Dot matrix printing is the general term for the production 
of a printed image upon a print medium accomplished 
by means of the depositing of a plurality of small individual 
spots or "dots" of ink upon the medium which, when 
viewed together, closely approximate the desired image. 
This general method is commonly used in the production of 
a variety of printed images and illustrations. It is effective 
because the printed dots can be made to be closer 
to or further away from each other to produce more or less 
darkly shaded areas as desired. Further, the phenomena of 
human perception tend to cause viewers to perceive the 
overall image that is intended, in spite of minor irregularities. 
Within the limits imposed by the relative size 
of the smallest portions of the image to be imprinted (the 
"detail") to the size of the dots used, such irregularities 
are perceived only as a reduction of the quality of the image 
presented. The impact dot matrix printer, wherein images are produced 
using a typewriter style inked ribbon and a plurality 
of wire "hammers" which impact the ribbon, thus causing the  
 
ribbon to deposit ink upon the medium, embodied the first 
large scale application of this principle in the field of 
computer hardcopy output. A later development has been the 
ink-jet printer. Ink-jet printers utilize the same dot matrix 
concept as do impact dot matrix printers. However, 
instead of depositing ink upon the medium by means of a 
hammer impacting an ink impregnated ribbon, ink-jet printers 
eject droplets of ink from a printhead onto the print 
medium. Each droplet, upon striking the medium, forms a 
small dot. Ink-jet printers have several advantages over impact 
printers in that they can be made to operate more quietly, 
faster, and more reliably (since there are far fewer moving 
parts). Also, ink-jet printers are more readily adaptable 
to applications requiring multi-colored print images, since 
they can easily be designed to incorporate nozzles or sets 
of nozzles for more than a single color of ink. In fact, 
it has become common to utilize four sets of nozzles in 
such applications, for the colors of cyan, magenta, yellow, 
and black. Cyan, magenta, and yellow are referred to as 
the subtractive primary colors. Additional color combinations 
can be produced by causing the printer to

<CLAIMS>
A method of placing ink drops (30) onto a surface of 
a print medium (12), which surface is defined as a matrix 

of pixels (40) that are arranged horizontally and 
vertically to define horizontally-adjacent rows of, 

vertically-adjacent columns of, and diagonally-adjacent, 
groups of pixels (42), using an ink jet 

printing apparatus having a multinozzle, scanning 
printhead for depositing ink drops onto the print medium, 

which method comprises: 

(1) during a first scan of the printhead, directing 
a series of first and second clusters of ink drops into 

contact with a series of first and second pixel groups 
respectively, each cluster containing a plural number of 

ink drops and each pixel group having a number of 
contiguous pixels equal to the number of drops in each 

cluster, with the first and second pixel groups being in 
a first and a second respectively, of said pixel group 

rows and in a first and a second, respectively, of said 
pixel group columns, and wherein the first and second 

clusters do not cover substantially portions of 
horizontally and vertically adjacent pixel groups; and 
(2) during a second scan of the printhead, repeating 
(1) to direct further clusters of ink drops into contact 

with the pixel groups that were not substantially covered 
during the first scan of the printhead;
 
   each drop in each cluster entirely covering a 

corresponding one of the pixels of the pixel group to 
which it is directed and in a manner such that adjacent 

ink drops overlap each other in the horizontal and 
vertical directions in each pixel group. 
A method according to claim 1 which comprises, during 
said first scan of the printhead, directing said series 

of first and second clusters of ink drops into contact 
with said series of first and second pixel groups so that  

 
said series of first pixel groups are located diagonally 

adjacent said series of second pixel groups. 
A method according to claim 2 which comprises 
directing said series of first and second clusters of ink 

drops into contact with said series of first and second 
pixel groups so that said ink drops of said series of 

first pixel groups are in diagonal tangential contact 
with said ink drops of said series of second pixel 

groups. 
A method according to any of claims 1 to 3 in which 
each of the clusters of ink drops comprise four ink drops 

and each pixel group comprises four contiguous pixels.
