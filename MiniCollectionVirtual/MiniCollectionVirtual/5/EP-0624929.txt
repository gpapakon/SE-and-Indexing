<ABSTRACT>
A short-circuit terminal mounted within an air 
bag-side housing includes contact portions that are formed 

respectively at opposite side portions thereof and are 
resiliently and selectively engaged with respective ones 

of a pair of female terminals. A narrow insulating plate 
that can intrude between one of the contact portions of 

the short-circuit terminal and an upper surface of one of 
the female terminals is mounted within a power source-side 

housing within which male terminals are provided. When 
the two housings are fitted together, the insulating plate 

intrudes between one contact portion of the short-circuit 
terminal and its associated female terminal, thereby 

interrupting an electrical connection between the pair of 
female terminals. With this construction, it is possible 

to reduce a manipulation force required for inserting and 
withdrawing a connector provided with a short-circuit 

terminal, and the connector will not trigger erroneous 
opening of the air bag.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved connector provided 
with a short-circuit terminal for short-circuiting open 
terminals connected to an operating device so that current 
may not accidentally flow into the operating device when 
the fitting between male and female connector housings is 
released. Air bags have been increasingly used for protecting 
passengers against the impact of a car crash. An operating 
circuit for such an air bag is formed by connecting terminals 
connected to an igniter for a gas-generating agent to 
terminals connected to a power source via an impact sensor. 
When an impact sensor detects a car collision, current 
flows to the igniter to ignite the gas-generating agent to 
produce a large amount of gas, thereby inflating the air 
bag. Although the air bag needs to be positively operated in 
the event of a collision, the air bag must be prevented 
from being erroneously operated when there is no collision. 
For example, the connection between the connectors can be 
released during the installation of the air bag and during 
inspection. At these times, terminals within an air bag-side 
connector housing become open. However, there is a risk 
that a magnetic field or an electric field produced around 
the open terminals could induce a voltage to develop 
between the open terminals so that current could flow into 
the igniter of the air bag, thus causing the above-mentioned 
erroneous operation. In the conventional connector, when the two connector 
housings are to be fitted together, an insulating plate is 
thrusted into two contact portions between a short-circuit 
terminal and a pair of terminals. In order to push together 
the connector housings of the conventional connectors, it 
is necessary to overcome a large frictional resistance associated  
 
with the insulating plate in addition to the already 
existing frictional resistance required to be overcome 
when connecting the terminals of the two housings together. 
Therefore, conventional connectors have encountered 
a drawback that a large manipulation force is required for 
the insertion and withdrawal of one housing relative to the 
other, thus providing difficult operability. Moreover since 
a large load must be overcome when the housings are to be 
fitted together, there is a possibility that the housings 
are inadvertently retained in an incompletely-fitted condition, 
and in such a case, there is a risk that an incomplete 
connection between the corresponding terminals may be 
encountered, thus failing to achieve a
