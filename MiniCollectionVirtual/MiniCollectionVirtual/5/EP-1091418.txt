<ABSTRACT>
A nitride programmable read only memory (NROM) cell has an oxide-nitride-oxide
(ONO) layer (109, 110, 111) over at least a channel (100) and a pocket implant

(120) self-aligned to at least one bit line junction (102). The cell also includes at least
one area of hot electron injection within the ONO layer and over the pocket implant and

at least one area of hot hole injection generally self-aligned to the area of hot electron
injection.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to FLASH, electrically erasable,
programmable read only memory (EEPROM) and nitride, programmable read
only memory (NROM) cells in general.Dual bit cells are known in the art although they are not common.
Some dual bit cells have multiple threshold voltage levels, where every two
threshold voltage levels together store a different bit. Others store one bit on
either side of the cell. A dual bit cell of the latter kind, known as nitride,
programmable read only memory (NROM) cell, is described in Applicant's
copending EP-A-1010182, entitled "Two Bit Non-Volatile
Electrically Erasable And Programmable Semiconductor Memory Cell Utilizing
Asymmetrical Charge Trapping" whose priority date is August 1, 1997. The
disclosure of the above-identified application is incorporated herein by
reference.Figs. 1A, 1B and 1C, to which reference is now made, schematically
illustrate the dual bit NROM cell. The cell has a single channel 100 between
two bit lines 102 and 104 but two separated and separately chargeable areas
106 and 108. Each area defines one bit. For the dual bit cell of Figs. 1, the
separately chargeable areas 106 and 108 are found within a nitride layer 110 
formed in an oxide-nitride-oxide sandwich (layers 109, 110 and 111)
underneath a polysilicon layer 112.To read the left bit, stored in area 106, right bit line 104 is the drain and
left bit line 102 is the source. This is known as the "read through" direction,
indicated by arrow 113. To read the right bit, stored in area 108, the cell is read
in the opposite direction, indicated by arrow 114. Thus, left bit line 102 is the
drain and right bit line 104 is the source.Fig. 1 B generally indicates what occurs within the cell during reading of
the left bit of area 106. An analogous operation occurs when reading the right
bit of area 108.To read the left bit in area 106, the left bit line 102 receives the source
voltage level Vs, typically of 0V, and the right bit line 104 receives the drain
voltage Vd, typically of 2V. The gate receives a relatively low voltage Vg, which
typically is a low voltage of 3V.The presence of the gate and drain voltages Vg and Vd, respectively,
induce a depletion layer 54 and an inversion layer 52 in the center of channel
100. The drain voltage Vd is large enough to induce a depletion region 55 near
drain 104 which extends to the depletion layer 54 of channel 100. This is
known as "barrier lowering" and it causes "punch-through" of electrons from the
inversion layer 52 to the drain 104. The
