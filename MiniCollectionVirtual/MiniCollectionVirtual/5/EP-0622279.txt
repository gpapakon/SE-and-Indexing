<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an ignition mechanism for a pyrotechnic gas generator (18) of an occupant restraint system for vehicles, in which a striking element (26) for triggering the tautening operation is pretensioned by at least one spring (56), in such a way that the spring (56) loads the striking element (26) in a first direction against a stop. Furthermore, as a result of the inertia forces taking effect during an acceleration of the vehicle, the spring (56) counteracts the movement of the striking element (26) in a second direction with a force increasing until a dead centre is reached. The spring (56) at the same time generates a torque which is converted by a transmission device (58) into an axial force loading the striking element (26).

An igniter mechanism for a pyrotechnical gas generator 
(18) of a vehicle occupant restraining system, having an 

impact member (26) assigned to the impact igniter (22) of 
the gas generator (18), the impact member (26) being axially 

slidable in a first and an opposite second direction in a 
housing (10) and including at least one tensioned spring 

(56) to load the impact element (26) in the first direction 
against a stop (265') and to counteract movement of the 

impact member (26) in the second direction as a result of 
the forces of inertia acting on acceleration of the vehicle 

by means of a force which grows until a dead center (264, 
264') is reached, the effective direction of the force being 

reversed when the dead center (264, 264') is passed so that 
the impact member (26) is accelerated in the second direction 

for triggering the impact igniter (22), 
characterized 
in that
 the spring (56) generates a torque which is 
converted by conversion means (58) into an axial force 

acting on the impact member (26). 
An igniter mechanism according to claim 1 
characterized 
in that
 the impact member (26) is mounted non-rotatably and 
the conversion m
eans (58) is mounted rotatably in the 
housing (10), and in that at least one control region is 

provided between the conversion means (58) and the impact 
member (26), said control region comprising interengaging 

cam surfaces (262, 263, 265; 262', 263', 265') connected to 
the conversion means (58) and the impact member (26),  

 
respectively, the cam surfaces acting as abutment surfaces 

for a force transmission member (60) provided between the 
conversion means (58) and the impact member (26). 
An igniter mechanism according to claim 2 
characterized 
in that
 the force transmission member is formed by a roller 
body (60) mounted on the conversion means (58) or on the 

impact member (26). 
An igniter mechanism according to claim 3 
characterized 
in that
 a plurality of control regions are provided located 
equally spaced circumferentially and in a plane perpendicular 

to the longitudinal axis of the impact member (26). 
An igniter mechanism according to any of the claims 2 to 
4 
characterized in that
 each of the cam surfaces (262, 263, 
265; 262', 263', 265') has a region (265, 265') extending 

substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis and 
forming the stop (265') and the abutment (265), respectively. 
An igniter mechanism according to any of the claims 2 to 
5, 
characterized in that
 the conversion means (58) mounted 
rotatably in the housing (10) is fixed axially, that the 

control region located between the conversion means (58) and 
the rotationally fixed and axially displaceable impact 

member (26) comprises on both sides of the dead center (264, 
264') cam surface regions (262, 262'; 263, 263') with 

different inclinations, and that the inclinations are set in 
such a manner that the impact member (26) is held in an 

initial position against the conversion means (58) due to a 
return force produced by the spring (56) while the impact 

member as a result of the forces of inertia acting on 
acceleration of the vehicle at first is displaced against 

the return force towards the impact igniter (22) and after 
passing the dead center (264, 264') is accelerated by the 

same spring (56) towards the impact igniter (22) and hereon 
is seperated from the conversion means (58).  

 
An igniter mechanism according to any of the claims 2 to 
6 
characterized in that
 the non-rotational mounting of the 
impact member (26) in the housing (10) is defined by grooves 

(46, 47) provided in the housing (10) and the impact member 
(26) and by a ball (50) located in the grooves (46, 47) 

facing each other.
