<ABSTRACT>
A cordless telephone system of the type comprising a plurality of telephone handsets communicating by two-way radio with a base unit connected to the public telephone network. In the larger premises, normally a plurality of spaced base units are employed, so that the handsets can communicate with the most favourably-positioned base unit wherever they are on the premises. In the present invention, however, larger premises are covered by just a single base unit (1), including within it all the necessary transceivers (7) together with a plurality of transponders (3, 4, 5) which are connected to the base unit and each other by means of an RF cable. The transponders each have aerials by which they can communicate by two-way radio with the handsets. The transponders downconvert the RF frequency of the radio link to a lower IF frequency which is passed to the transceivers (7) via the cable (6). The transponders (3, 4, 5) can be distributed about the premises as needed to provide complete radio coverage.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a cordless telephone system.The basic cordless telephone system comprises a base unit
which is hard wired to the public telephone (PSTN or ISDN) network
together with one or more handsets which are linked to the base unit by
means of a two-way radio link. To this end, each handset includes a
transceiver and a keyboard with associated circuitry, and the base unit
comprises one or more transceivers, at least one for each handset,
together with control and interface circuitry.In order to cater for larger systems installed in physically
larger premises, it is known to provide a plurality of base units distributed
around the premises and all hard wired to a central control and interface
unit at which the connections to the external telephone network are made.
The maximum capacity of each base unit in such a system is defined by
the number of transceivers which are installed in that base unit.WO-A-92/13400 describes a global cellular radio telephony
system comprising a network of base stations some of which have
additional associated aerials, all of which communicate with their
associated base station using channels located in a common frequency
band so as to be effectively transparent to the system thereby enabling the
aerials to be operated in a manner which creates a virtual base station, as
seen by a handset.The present invention is concerned primarily with the larger
systems which would ordinarily require multiple base units, as described
above. In the present invention, instead of a plurality of base units each 
having a number of transceivers, the system comprises just one base unit,
which includes all the necessary transceivers, together with the usual
control and interface circuitry, and is characterised by further comprising a
plurality of RF input/output "heads" which communicate with the individual
handsets on the system, and pass signals to and from the handsets by
radio communication. The RF heads will be distributed about the premises
in the same manner as the base units would have been, and are linked to 
each other and to the base unit by means of a hardwired
RF connection, such as coaxial cable.Preferably the RF heads will be non-intelligent,
and will simply convert signals from
hard-wired form to radio form, probably with a change
of frequency involved. In the preferred embodiment
of the invention, each RF head comprises a respective
transponder which acts as a wideband converter of
signals to and from the RF connection. Preferably
the incoming signal is converted

<CLAIMS>
A telecommunications system comprising a portable part in
the form of a plurality of handsets, and a fixed part, each said handset

comprising a telephone keyboard and a transceiver for communicating by
two-way radio with the fixed part, and wherein the fixed part comprises a

base unit which includes transceivers (7) and is suitable for connection to
the public telephone network, and a plurality of transponders (3,4,5)

connected to each other and to the base unit by means of a hard-wired RF
connection (6), each transponder having an aerial by which it may

communicate by way of said two-way radio with said handsets and being
arranged to convert the two-way radio signals to lower frequency RF

signals, hereinafter referred to as IF signals, which are passed to the base
unit by means of said hard-wired RF connection (6) characterised in that

said system is a cordless telephone system for installation in a premises
with said transponders (3,4,5) being physically separable from the base

unit such that they may be distributed about the premises to give complete
radio coverage of the premises; each transponder (3,4,5) converts radio

signals to and from an IF band different to the IF bands of all other
transponders, so that each of the transponders can be uniquely identified

at the base unit on the basis of its IF band and is capable of
communicating by two-way radio with a handset on any one of a plurality of

channels, spaced apart in frequency, the IF band to which the transponder
downconverts being broad enough to carry all such channels; and each

transceiver (7) in said base unit has means for selecting a channel from
any one of said IF bands. 
A system as claimed in claim 1 wherein each transceiver (7)
has means for converting said IF signal to a signal suitable for transmission

on said telephone network, and vice versa.
A system as claimed in any one of claims 1 or 2 wherein
each transceiver (7) has means for selecting the channel within an IF band

which is providing the best reception.
A system as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3 wherein each
transceiver (7) has means for scanning sequentially across the channels in

each IF band.
A system as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4 wherein the
transceivers (7) and/or the transponders (3,4,5) are made frequency agile,

by incorporating means for changing the IF frequency to which they are
tuned in accordance with the requirements of the system.
