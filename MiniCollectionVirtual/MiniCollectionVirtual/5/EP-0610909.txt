<ABSTRACT>
In a scanning optical system, a first light detecting 
body is disposed so as to be coplanar with a surface to be 

scanned, whereas a second light detecting body is disposed in 
front of the surface to be scanned. Outputs of the light 

detecting bodies are applied to a first rise time detecting 
circuit and a second rise time detecting circuit to detect 

rise times, respectively. The rise times are applied to a 
comparing circuit, which compares a difference therebetween 

to detect a displacement of a beam of light that is scanning 
the surface to be scanned from the focus. A control circuit 

outputs a signal for correcting the displacement from the 
focus. Simultaneously therewith, a spot judging circuit 

detects the profile of a spot of the beam of light that is 
scanning the surface to be scanned from the rise time.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to scanning optical systems
according to the preambel of claim 1 and claim 4.In scanning optical systems for recording images by
scanning a recording medium, which is a surface to be
scanned with a beam of light, the light converging position
(i.e., the beam waist position) must be located on the surface
to be scanned with extremely high accuracy.Further, scanning optical systems for use in laser
printers and the like address the following problems. Even
if the light beam converging position has been adjusted
with high accuracy, changes in ambient temperature during
the operation of the optical system not only cause optical
parts constituting the scanning optical system and the surface
plate carrying the optical parts to expand and contract,
but als cause the indices of refraction of the optical
parts to fluctuate, thereby displacing the light
coverging position from the surface to be scanned. When the light coverging position is displaced from
the surface to be scanned, the diameter of a spot of the
light beam irradiated onto the surface to be scanned is
varied from a desired value, and as a result, the quality
of the recorded image is impaired. Hence, the light source
or the optical system must be moved in the direction of the
optical axis so that the light beam converging position can
be maintained on the surface to be scanned at all times
even after the light converging position of the optical
system has once been adjusted. To implement this, displacements
of the light converging from the surface to be
scanned must be detected sequentially.Disclosed as a solution to this problem are, e.g.,
Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication Nos. JP 61-10769 and
JP 1-237614.The publication No. JP-A-04155304 which corresponds to
postpublished US 5,231,280 is designed to detect the profile
of a spotlight by arranging a single light detector on
a surface to be scanned and an image rotator for rotating
the spotlight. The light detector is constituted by a knife
edge. Therefore such an apparatus according to US 5,231,280
is known for detecting a focusing error of a light beam
which converges on a surface of a recording medium in an
image forming system and scans the surface of the recording
medium in a scanning direction parallel to a rotation axis
of the recording medium. This apparatus comprises mutually
opposed first and second knife edges placed adjacent to the
recording medium, said first and second knife edges being
aligned on a scanning line in the scanning direction and
separated
