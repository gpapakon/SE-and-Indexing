<ABSTRACT>
A first radiating electrode 5 and second radiating
electrode 6 are formed on an upper face 2c of a dielectric

base 2 of a surface-mounted antenna 1, and a rectifying
circuit 7 is formed on a side face 2b where radiating

electrodes 5 and 6 are not formed. This facilitates
configuration of a desired rectifying circuit 7 appropriate

for the surface-mounted antenna 1, and rectification of the
surface-mounted antenna 1 is facilitated. Also, since the

rectifying circuit 7 is formed on the side face 2b of the
dielectric base 2, effects of the rectifying circuit 7 on

the first radiating electrode 5 and second radiating
electrode 6 on the upper face 2c can be reduced.

Accordingly, high gain and increased bandwidth of the
surface-mounted antenna can be obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a surface-mounted
antenna provided in communication devices such as cellular
telephones and the like, and to a communication device
comprising the antenna.Fig. 13 schematically shows an example of a
conventional surface-mounted antenna. The surface-mounted
antenna 1 shown in Fig. 13 is an antenna mounted to a
circuit board built into a communication device such as a
cellular telephone or the like, and comprises an
approximately rectangular parallelepiped dielectric base 2
composed, for example, of a ceramic or resin dielectric
member.A ground electrode 3 is formed over almost the entire
surface of the base face 2a of this dielectric base 2, and
also, an electric power supplying electrode 4 is formed on
the area on the base face 2a where the ground electrode 3 is
not formed, with a predetermined spacing between the
electric power supplying electrode 4 and the ground 
electrode 3. This electric power supplying electrode 4 is
formed in a manner extended from the base face 2a to the
side face 2b of the dielectric base 2.Further, a first radiating electrode 5 and a second
radiating electrode 6 are formed from the upper face 2c to
the side face 2d of the dielectric base 2, with a slit S
introduced therebetween, and the first radiating electrode 5
and second radiating electrode 6 are both connected to the
ground electrode 3.The surface-mounted antenna 1 shown in Fig. 13 is
mounted to the circuit board in a communication device with
the base face 2a of the dielectric base 2 toward the circuit
board. A rectifying circuit 7 and an electric power
supplying circuit 8 are formed on the circuit board, and
mounting the surface-mounted antenna 1 to the circuit board
as described above connects the electric power supplying
electrode 4 to the electric power supplying circuit 8 via
the rectifying circuit 7 by conduction.In the state of the surface-mounted antenna 1 being
thus mounted to the circuit board, once electric power is
supplied to the electric power supplying electrode 4 from
the electric power supplying circuit 8 via the rectifying
circuit 7, the supplied electric power is transferred by
capacitive coupling from the electric power supplying
electrode 4 to the first radiating electrode 5 and second 
radiating electrode 6, and the first radiating electrode 5
and second radiating electrode 6 resonate based on the
electric power so as to transmit and receive radio waves.Now, the resonance frequency (center frequency) of the
first radiating electrode 5 and the resonance frequency
