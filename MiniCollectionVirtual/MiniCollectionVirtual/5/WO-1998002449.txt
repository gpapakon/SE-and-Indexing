<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides labeled nucleic acid amplification oligonucleotides, which can be linear or hairpin primers or blocking oligonucleotides. The oligonucleotides of the invention are labeled with donor and/or acceptor moieties of molecular energy transfer pairs. The moieties can be fluorophores, such that fluorescent energy emitted by the donor is absorbed by the acceptor. The acceptor may be a fluorophore that fluoresces at a wavelength different from the donor moiety, or it may be a quencher. The oligonucleotides of the invention are configured so that a donor moiety and an acceptor moiety are incorporated into the amplification product. The invention also provides methods and kits for directly detecting amplification products employing the nucleic acid amplification primers. When labeled linear primers are used, treatment with exonuclease or by using specific temperature eliminates the need for separation of unincorporated primers. This "closed-tube" format greatly reduces the possibility of carryover contamination with amplification products, provides for high throughput of samples, and may be totally automated.

 NUCLEIC ACID AMPLIFICATIONOLIGONUCLEOTIDES WITH MOLECULAR ENERGYTRANSFER LABELS AND METHODS BASED THEREONThis application is a continuation-in-part of copending application Serial No. 08/837,034 filed April 11, 1997, which in turn is a continuation-in-part of copending application Serial No. 08/778,487 filed January 3, 1997, which in turn is a continuation-in-part of copending application Serial No. 08/683,667 filed July 16, 1996, each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.1. INTRODUCTIONThe present invention relates to oligonucleotides for amplification of nucleic acids that are detectably labeled with molecular energy transfer (MET) labels. It also relates to methods for detecting the products of nucleic acid amplification using these oligonucleotides. It further relates to a rapid, sensitive, and reliable method for detecting amplification products that greatly decreases the possibility of carryover contamination with amplification products and that is adaptable to many methods for amplification of nucleic acid sequences, including polymerase chain reaction (PCR) , tria plification, and other amplification systems.2. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION2.1. FLUORESCENCE RESONANCE ENERGY TRANSFER (FRET) Molecular energy transfer (MET) is a process by which energy is passed non-radiatively between a donor molecule and an acceptor molecule. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) is a form of MET. FRET arises from the properties of certain chemical compounds; when excited by exposure to particular wavelengths of light, they emit light (i.e., they fluoresce) at a different wavelength. Such compounds are termed fluorophores . In FRET, energy is passed non-radiatively over a long distance (10-lOOA) between a 

donor molecule, which is a fluorophore, and an acceptor molecule. The donor absorbs a photon and transfers this energy nonradiatively to the acceptor (FÎ´rster, 1949, Z. Naturforsch. A4 : 321-327; Clegg, 1992, Methods Enzy ol. 211: 353-388) .When two fluorophores whose excitation and emission spectra overlap are in close proximity, excitation of one fluorophore will cause it to emit light at wavelengths that are absorbed by and that stimulate the second fluorophore, causing it in turn to fluoresce. In other words, the excited-state energy of the first (donor) fluorophore is transferred by a resonance induced dipole - dipole interaction to the neighboring second (acceptor) fluorophore. As a result, the lifetime of the donor molecule is decreased and its fluorescence is quenched,
