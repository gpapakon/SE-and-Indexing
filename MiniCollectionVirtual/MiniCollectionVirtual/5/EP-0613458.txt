<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel acyclic
ethylenediamine derivatives, pharmaceutical compositions
comprising such compounds and the use of such compounds in
the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment and prevention of inflammatory and central
nervous system disorders, as well as several other
disorders. The pharmaceutically active compounds of this
invention are substance P receptor antagonists. This
invention also relates to novel intermediates used in the
synthesis of such substance P receptor antagonists.Substance P is a naturally occurring undecapeptide
belonging to the tachykinin family of peptides, the latter
being named because of their prompt stimulatory action on
smooth muscle tissue. More specifically, substance P is a
pharmacologically active neuropeptide that is produced in
mammals (having originally been isolated from gut) and
possesses a characteristic amino acid sequence that is
illustrated by D. F. Veber etal. in U.S. Patent No.
4,680,283. The wide involvement of substance P and other
tachykinins in the pathophysiology of numerous diseases has
been amply demonstrated in the art. For instance, substance
P has recently been shown to be involved in the transmission
of pain or migraine (see B.E.B. Sandberg etal., Journal of
Medicinal Chemistry, 25, 1009 (1982)), as well as in central
nervous system disorders such as anxiety and schizophrenia,
in respiratory and inflammatory diseases such as asthma and
rheumatoid arthritis, respectively, in rheumatic diseases
such as fibrositis, and in gastrointestinal disorders and
diseases of the GI tract such as ulcerative colitis and
Crohn's disease, etc. (see D. Regoli in "Trends in Cluster
Headache," edited by F. Sicuteri etal., Elsevier Scientific
Publishers, Amsterdam, pp. 85-95 (1987)).Quinuclidine, piperidine, azanorbornane derivatives and
related compounds that exhibit activity as substance P 
receptor antagonists are referred to in United States Patent
