<ABSTRACT>
A method of forming a solder connection between a plurality of elongate bodies, comprises: (i) forming an initial connection between the elongate bodies by inserting them into an induction heatable connecting element of a connector, the connector comprising a dimensionally heat-recoverable sleeve and, retained within the sleeve, the connecting element and a solder insert that is in thermal contact with the connecting element; and (ii) heating the connector (a) by subjecting the connecting element to an alternating magnetic field so that it is heated by induction thereby melting the solder insert, and (b) subjecting the sleeve to hot air and/or infrared radiation, thereby causing the sleeve to recover. Also disclosed is an apparatus for applying heat to an elongate connector, comprising a first heat source which comprises an induction coil, and a second heat source arranged to generate hot air or infrared radiation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the formation of connections between
elongate bodies, particularly electrical connections and especially connections
between electrical wires and cables.In many instances it is desired to form a solder connection between
two or more wires. This can, for example be achieved by means of solder
connection devices comprising a small dimensionally heat-recoverable sleeve
which contains a quantity of solder. The wires can be inserted into the sleeve
after the ends have been stripped of insulation, and the device can then be
heated, for example by means of a hot-air gun or by an infrared lamp, to
recover the sleeve about the wires and to melt the solder inside the sleeve. A
device for forming such a solder connection is disclosed in International
Patent Application publication No. WO92/00616.
That device comprises a metallic
connecting element in the form of a tapering helical coil of wire located in a
dimensionally heat-recoverably sleeve, and a quantity of solder. The device
enables a temporary or initial electrical connection to be formed by screwing
the device onto the wires and then, for example after the connection has been
electrically tested, the device can be heated to form a permanent electrical
connection. By means of such devices it is possible to form very reliable
solder joints which are sealed against ingress of moisture. However in many 
cases a degree of skill is required on the part of the operator in order to
ensure that the solder is fully melted but at the same time to prevent
overheating of the wire insulation the heat-recoverable sleeve or the like.Self-regulating induction heating has been used in an attempt to
prevent overheating. For example, European patent application, publication
No. 0371458 discloses a method of terminating an electrical wire at a
connector assembly, in which the connector terminal, comprising a solder tail,
has a thin layer of a self-regulating heating source bonded to it. The self-regulating
heating source comprises a foil having a first layer of copper or
copper alloy which has a low resistance and minimal magnetic permeability,
and a second thin layer of magnetic material such as nickel-iron alloy. The
electrical wire is terminated by placing a stripped end of the wire over the
solder tail. An alternating magnetic field is then applied to the self-regulating
heating source, at a frequency of 13.56 MHz for example, causing the solder
tail to heat up and melt the solder and cause the sleeve to shrink. Because the
heating source is

A method of forming a solder connection between a plurality of elongate
bodies, which comprises:


(i) forming an initial connection between the elongate bodies (2; 36, 38) by inserting
them into an induction heatable connecting element (4; 32) of a connector (1), the

connector comprising a dimensionally heat-recoverable sleeve (3: 31) and,
retained within the sleeve, the connecting element and a solder insert (8; 33', 33") that

is in thermal contact with the connecting element; and
(ii) heating the connector (a) by subjecting the connecting element (4; 32) to an
alternating magnetic field so that it is heated by induction thereby melting

the solder insert, and (b) subjecting the exterior of the sleeve to hot air
and/or infrared radiation, thereby causing the sleeve to recover.

alternating magnetic field and the hot air and/or infrared radiation substantially

simultaneously.

radiation is applied to a portion of the sleeve which is longitudinally adjacent to a

portion of the sleeve which retains the connecting element. 
A method as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3,
wherein the infrared radiation is applied to the sleeve

by means of a heating element (13; 52) located outside the sleeve,
which element is heated by induction.

alternating magnetic field that heats the connecting

element is produced by an induction coil (51') which also heats
the heating element.
A method as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5,
