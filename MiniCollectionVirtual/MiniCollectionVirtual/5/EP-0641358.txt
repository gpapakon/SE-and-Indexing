<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to blocking peptides which are capable of binding to ligands for the erbB-2 receptor or the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The blocking peptides of the invention are used to detect the presence of such ligand molecules. In addition, the blocking peptides are useful in inhibiting or preventing the growth of adenocarcinoma cells which express the erbB-2 receptor or the EGFR.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the field of blocking peptides which interact with
ligand growth factor receptors. Specifically, the blocking peptides of the invention
are capable of binding to ligands to the epidermal growth factor receptor and the
erbB-2 receptor. The present invention further relates to the use of such blocking
peptides in assays to detect the presence of ligand growth factors. Methods of 
using the blocking peptides of the invention as a means of inhibiting the growth
of adenocarcinoma cells and for diagnosing cancer are also disclosed.Transforming growth factor ligands belong to a family of heat and
acid-stable polypeptides which allow cells to assume a transformed morphology
and form progressively growing colonies in anchorage-independent growth assays
(DeLarco, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 75:4001-4005 (1978); Moses, et
al., Cancer Res., 41:2842-2848 (1981); Ozanne, et al., J. Cell. Physiol.,
105:163-180 (1980); Roberts, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA , 77:3494-3498
(1980)). The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and its physiologic
ligands, epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming growth factor alpha
(TGFα), play a prominent role in the growth regulation of many normal and
malignant cell types (Carpenter, G., Annu. Rev. Biochem., 56:881-914 (1987)).One role the EGF receptor system may play in the oncogenic growth of
cells is through autocrine-stimulated growth. If cells express the EGFR and
secrete EGF and/or TGFα then such cells could stimulate their own growth. Since
some human breast cancer cell lines and tumors express EGFR (Osborne, et al.,
J. Clin. Endo. Metab., 55:86-93 (1982); Fitzpatrick, et al., Cancer Res.,
44:3442-3447 (1984); Filmus, et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.,
128:898-905 (1985); Davidson, et al., Mol. Endocrinol., 1:216-223 (1987);
Sainsbury, et al., Lancet, i:1398-1402 (1987); Perez, et al., Cancer Res. Treat.,
4:189-193 (1984)) and secrete TGFα (Bates, et al., Cancer Res., 46:1707-1713
(1986); Bates, et al., Mol. Endocrinol., 2:543-555 (1988)), an autocrine growth 
stimulatory pathway has been proposed in breast cancer (Lippman, et al., Breast
Cancer Res. Treat., 7:59-70 (1986)).An autocrine growth stimulatory pathway analogous to that proposed for
epidermal growth factor receptor and its ligands may also be employed by a
growing list of oncogene encoded transmembrane proteins that have structure
reminiscent of growth factor receptors. This list includes the protooncogenes neu
and its human equivalent erbB-2 or HER2 (Bargmann, et al.,
