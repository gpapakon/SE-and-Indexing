<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved process for the
polymerization of olefins. More particularly, the present invention
relates to a process for the polymerization of olefins by high yield
catalysts of the Ziegler-Natta type, whereby a better control over
specifications of the product and/or a better yield is obtained.Industrial applications of light olefin-containing hydrocarbons, and
particularly liquified propylene, have become more increasingly
specialized. The technology as presently developed utilizes highly
efficient catalysts to convert these light olefins into final products
such as polymers, any excess being recycled. The latest technology in
propylene polymerization uses as solvent the propylene itself, the large
excess of which is recycled. Since these highly efficient catalysts are
very sensitive, impurities in recycled olefins may deactivate them at
least partially, leading to a productivity decrease. Further, some
impurities may gradually accumulate in the recycle stream. It has also
been observed that some properties and particularly the melt flow index of
the polymers is unstable as a function of time.US-A-5134208 discloses achieving production of polypropylene having
increased or decreased melt flow by contacting at least a portion of the
recycle stream with a metal hydride or metal hydride precursor.As a result, there is a real need to improve techniques for the
polymerization of olefins, more particularly when high yield catalysts are
used.It is an object of the invention to provide an improved process for the
polymerization of olefins.Another object of this invention is to provide a process comprising a
recycle of the monomer whereby polymer/catalyst ratios are increased.Still another object of the invention is to provide a process comprising a
recycle of the monomer whereby a better control of specifications of the
polymer is obtained. In accordance with the present invention, the process of the invention
comprises at least the steps of :
(i) converting part of the light olefins contained in a hydrocarbon
feedstock into a polymer over a Ziegler-Natta type catalyst;(ii) separating the polymer from the unreacted feedstock;(iii) passing the said unreacted feedstock over a material comprising
nickel deposited on a support material and wherein the nickel is
present in the forms of metallic nickel and of nickel oxide;(iv) recycling the feedstock into step (i).Light olefins, as used herein, are C2-C6 olefins. Of particular interest
are ethylene and propylene, with 1-hexene
