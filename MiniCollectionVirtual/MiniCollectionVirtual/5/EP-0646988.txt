<ABSTRACT>
A rotating body (14) is mounted, such that its rotation position about a central axis (A) can be adjusted in a bearing hole (12) in a housing (10). The rotating body (14) has a recess (16) with a retaining axis (B) which is not the same as the central axis (A). An adjusting screw (22), which is mounted such that it can rotate but cannot be displaced, extends through the housing (10), transversely with respect to the bearing hole (12) and passing through said hole. The adjusting screw (22) is tangential to the rotating body (14) in such a manner that a tooth system (30) like a worm-drive tooth system is formed in the rotating body (14) when the adjusting screw (22) is rotated. In consequence, the rotational movement of the adjusting screw (22) can be transmitted via the tooth system (30) to the rotating body (14). The housing (10) furthermore has a connecting channel (32) which is aligned with the recess (16) in the rotating body (14) when said rotating body (14) is in a specific rotational angular position. The elongated object (34) can thus be pushed through the connecting channel (32) into the recess (16) and can subsequently be clamped firmly between the rotating body (14) and the housing (10) by rotation of said rotating body (14).
