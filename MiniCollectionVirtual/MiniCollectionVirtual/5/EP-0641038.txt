contact object having a plurality of portions to be contacted 
such that the respective bump contacts face to the portions to 

be contacted at a joined surface, correspondingly each other to

the laminate in a compressing direction with pressurizing means 
provided so as to pinch the laminate in a laminating direction 

to contact the plural bump contacts mounted on the flexible

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a suitable method for
connecting a flexible circuit substrate to a contact object
having a plurality of portions to be contacted, such as
electronic parts and electronic circuits, and a structure
thereof.With recent high integration of semiconductor elements
and high density mounting of electronic parts on circuit
substrates, the number of signal wiring units, connection
terminals and electrodes on contact objects has increased, and
the spacing therebetween has also become closer.The electronic parts are usually checked with respect
to their characteristics and qualities at every stage of their
manufacturing process. For example, at a stage at which a
number of LSIs are formed on a silicon wafer or at a stage at
which they are parted (the substances at these stages are
hereinafter referred to as "bare chips"), a probe is required
which can make contact with minute inspection objects densely
arranged in an about 4 to 15 mm square region, simultaneously
at multiple points with high reliability.Further, when the above-described bare chips are
directly integrated into a product, or at a stage at which a
substrate densely provided with a number of electronic parts is 
integrated into a product together with other circuit blocks,
a connecting structure which enables them to connect to a
number of densely arranged contact objects with high
reliability is also required, as is the case with the
inspections at the above-described stages.A connecting structure using a flexible circuit
substrate having projecting bump contacts on a surface thereof
is known as a structure which can effect temporary contact or
lasting connection to the above-described contact objects
formed minutely and densely.Fig. 6 is a partial sectional schematic view showing a
conventional flexible circuit substrate and a connected state
thereof to a contact object. Referring to Fig. 6, a1 is a
conventional flexible circuit substrate in which a plurality of
bump contacts 2 mounted on one surface of an electrically
insulating film 1 are electrically connected to circuit
patterns 3 provided on either surface of the film 1 or on an
under layer of an electrically insulating protective film 4.
The flexible circuit substrate a1 is laminated with a contact
object b such that a plurality of portions 5 to be contacted on
the contact object b such as an electric part are contacted
with the above-described bump contacts 2, correspondingly each
other. Pressure F is applied to the entire surfaces of the
laminate in a

A method for connecting a flexible circuit substrate (a) to a contact object (b)
comprising the following steps:


laminating the flexible circuit substrate (a) having a plurality of bump
contacts (2) with the contact object (b) having a plurality of portions (5) to

be connected,
wherein the plural bump contacts (2) mounted on one surface of an
insulating film (1) are electrically connected to circuit patterns (3) provided

on either surface of said film (1) or in the inside thereof, an elastic
material (7) in the form of individual bodies is mounted in a position

corresponding to the back side of the respective bump contacts
(2) and the plural bump contacts (2) face to corresponding plural portions

(5) at a joined surface thereby forming a laminate,
applying pressure to the entire surface of said laminate in a compression
direction with pressurizing means (6a, 6b) provided so as to pinch said

laminate in a laminating direction to contact said plural bump contacts (2)
with the corresponding plural portions (5).
The method as claimed in claim 1,
characterized in that

at least one of the pressurizing means (6a, 6b) pinching the laminate in a
laminating direction collectively receives pressure from a pressurizing

source (12) at a pressure carrier portion (10), and dispersedly transmits it to
the respective contacts of the bump contact (2), and the portions (5), to be

contacted through a transmitting portion. 
The method as claimed in claim 1,
characterized by that

the elastic material (7) is mounted in a position corresponding to the back
side of the portion (5) to be contacted of the contact object (b) so as to

intervene said elastic material (7) between the portion (5) to be contacted
and the pressurizing means (6a, 6b) on the side of said portion (5) to be

contacted.
A connecting structure of a flexible circuit substrate (a) and a contact object

laminate in a laminating direction, thereby applying pressure to the entire
