<ABSTRACT>
This iron comprises a casing (1), an ironing plate (2) including a heating element (resistor) (3) which is embedded in the plate (2) and has its ends (4, 5) projecting from the upper face of the said plate (2) into the rear region of the iron, as well as a heat shield (7) interposed between the said upper face of the plate and the casing, and held on the said plate by fastening means. These means for fastening the heat shield (7) comprise, in the front part of the plate, an element (9) for anchoring the shield (7) to the plate (2) and, in the rear part of the plate, a device (10) for attaching the shield (7) onto the projecting ends (4, 5) of the heating element (3).

Iron comprising a casing (1), an ironing sole plate (2) 
including a heating element (3) which is embedded in the sole 

plate (2) and the ends of which (4, 5) project from the top 
face of the said sole plate (2) in the rear region of the 

iron, and a heat screen (7) interposed between the said top 
face of the sole plate and the casing, and held on the sole 

plate by fixing means, characterised in that the means of 
fixing the heat screen (7) comprise, in the front part of the 

sole plate, a component (9) for anchoring the screen (7) to 
the sole plate (2) and, in the rear part of the sole plate, a 

device (10) for attaching the screen (7) to the projecting 
ends (4, 5) of the element (3). 
Iron according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
attaching device (10) has lugs (P1, P2) fixed to the screen 

(7) and directed towards the sole plate and the lower areas of 
which each have a hook having a surface (11, 12) offering 

friction with the corresponding end (4, 5) of the element. 
Iron according to Claim 2, characterised in that the hooks 
are formed by tubular guides (13, 14) produced in the lugs 

(P1, P2) of the heat screen (7) and an area of the internal 
wall of which forms a friction surface (11, 12) designed to 

come into engagement with the respective ends (4, 5) of the 
element. 
Iron according to Claim 2 or 3, characterised in that each 
end of the element has a silicone sleeve (15, 16) which comes 

into engagement with the friction surfaces (11, 12). 
Iron according to Claim 3 or 4, characterised in that the 
ends (4, 5) of the element (3) project upwards in a direction 

inclined with respect to the top face (6) of the sole plate  
 

(2), the tubular guides (13, 14) are also inclined. 
Iron according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that, between the sole plate and the bottom 

face of the screen, there is interposed a protrusion (B) so as 
to obtain, with the anchoring component (9), a lever effect 

between the front and rear parts of the screen. 
Iron according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the component (9) for anchoring the 

screen (7) on the front part of the sole plate (2) is a screw 
(9) which comes into engagement with the sole plate (2). 
Iron according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the casing encloses a water reservoir 

(21) and the sole plate (2) has a vaporisation chamber (24) 
communicating with steam outlet orifices (23) formed in the 

sole plate (2), the said casing being separated from the sole 
plate by the screen (7) which is fixed by the anchoring 

component (9) and the attaching device (10). 
Method for manufacturing an iron according to Claim 3, 
characterised in that the tubular guides (13, 14) of the heat 

screen (7) are fitted by translation respectively onto the 
ends (4, 5) of the element, and then the screen (7) is held in 

the correct position on the sole plate (2) by the anchoring 
component (9) situated in the front region of the sole plate 

(2).
