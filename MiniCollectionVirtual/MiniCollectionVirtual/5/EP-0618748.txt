<ABSTRACT>
This apparatus includes: a plurality of access terminals (1801 to 180N) for users having information to transmit to a certain destination with a certain data rate, a plurality of connecting terminals (170 to 173) for a plurality of points of access to the said network, a plurality of service circuits (C1 to CM) equipped with queueing elements (2051 to 205p) for storing user data and for supplying the cells to be transmitted, on data outputs (S1 to SM), a common data line (200) interconnecting the data outputs of the said service circuits, a plurality of network circuits (R0 to R3) equipped with output circuits, the inputs of which are connected to the said data line and the outputs of which are connected to the said connecting terminals. This device further includes: an allocation unit for allocating cell sampling times for the said data line to each of the output circuits depending on the data rate to be carried by the said output circuits.   Application to A.T.M. networks.
