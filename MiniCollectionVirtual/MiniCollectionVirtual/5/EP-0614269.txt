<ABSTRACT>
A power amplifier is provided for amplifying a radio 
frequency signal such as in a burst modulation manner for 

use in GSM cellular radio. 
The amplifier has means, such as a ROM (16), for 
producing a predetermined sequence of values in response to 

a control pulse. Means (21) are provided for converting 
each value into a power control signal, and control means 

(9) are provided for controlling the amplifier output power 
in accordance with said power control signal. In this 

manner, the power/time characteristic can be made to take 
the form of a raised cosine. 
The invention also provides power selection means 
for selecting a nominal output level from a plurality of 

discrete levels and for selecting power sub-levels offset 
from said selected level. An indication is recorded as to 

which sub-level best represents the nominal power level.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention provides a power amplifier for amplifying a radio
frequency signal, for example a pulsed power amplifier responsive to a
control pulse. The amplifier is particularly useful for digital mobile
cellular radio transmitters for use on the Pan-European GSM cellular
network.In the field of power control circuits, EP-A-0261967 describes a
control loop for a power amplifier in which a digital value is output from a
controller and converted to analog form for control of the amplifier when
input power falls below a threshold.In a burst modulated power amplifier, the transmitter must observe
a time domain template upon turn-on and turn-off, as well as a frequency
domain template. In the past, the shape of the power characteristic as it
rises at the start of a burst and falls at the end has been controlled by
means of shaping circuits consisting of resistors and analog switches.
Such circuits can be bulky and unreliable and have limited accuracy.As well as the above power/time characteristic, the output power of a
GSM mobile radio transmitter must be adjustable in sixteen steps from
+43 dbm to +13 dbm. Many tolerance factors within the amplifier will
affect the ultimate output power. Manual adjustment means can be
provided for pre-setting the output power levels before the equipment leaves
the factory, however separate adjustment means within the equipment for
each of the sixteen power levels would be bulky, and their adjustment
would be time consuming. The abstract of Japanese patent application no.
62-118622 describes an adjustable power amplifier as is well known.It is an aim of the present invention to provide an improved power
amplifier to overcome some of the above problems.According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided
a power amplifier for amplifying a radio frequency signal, said amplifier
comprising: power selection means for selecting a nominal output power
level from a plurality of discrete levels; power control means for controlling
output power in response to said power selection means; input means for
indicating measured output power; and characterised by: storage means
responsive to the input means for storing information in response to the 
measured output power, for future calibration of the selected nominal
output power level wherein the storage means comprises means for
recording, in respect of each of said nominal output power levels, which of
a plurality of power sub-levels offset from said selected nominal output power level gives rise to an output power
