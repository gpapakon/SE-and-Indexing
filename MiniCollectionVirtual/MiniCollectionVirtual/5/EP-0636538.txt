The present invention relates to an electrically power 
assisted vehicle, in particular bicycle which comprises a 

human power drive system and an electrical power assist 
drive system and a control means (46) for controlling an output 

of the electrical power assist drive system in response to 
variations in an output of the human power drive system. The 

electrical power assist drive system is drivingly connected

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electrically power assisted
vehicle, specifically bicycle as indicated in the preaable
of claim 1.Electrically power assisted bicycles of the type shown in
European Patent Applications 0 559 231, 0 590 674, 0 517 224
and 0 569 954, have a number of advantages. In the construction
shown in each of those applications and the aforenoted patent,
the bicycle is provided with a conventional pedal mechanism
operated by the rider.In addition, there is provided an electric motor powered
by a battery and controller arrangement for assisting the
operator effort in response to the pedal input force so as to
make the riding of the bicycle easier while at the same time
maintaining its ability to provide exercise for the rider.
In the connection between the electric motor and the driven
rear wheel of the bicycle, it is the practice to incorporate
a gear reduction unit so as to reduce the speed and increase
the power output of the electric motor for transmission to
the driven wheel. It has already been proposed to employ
a planetary transmission is
employed between the motor output shaft and the drive for the
rear wheel so as to provide this speed reduction. Although
this type of arrangement is extremely effective, the stacked
electric motor and transmission somewhat increases the length
of the electric drive and also the use of a separate motor
and transmission requires alignment of the component to
insure smooth operation. In conjunction with the use of an electric motor for
assisted power of a bicycle, it is the general practice, as
disclosed in the aforenoted copending
European patent applications
that one way clutches are interposed between both the
electric motor and the rear wheel and between the crank
mechanism and the rear wheel drive so as to facilitate the
transmission of power and not to transmit power to portions
which should not be driven. The use of one way clutches
requires a pair of elements with one way clutching elements
interposed between them. The two elements that are
interconnected by the one way clutching elements must be
maintained so that their axes of rotation are substantially
coincident and it is the normal practice to employ a bearing
arrangement for this purpose. This obviously adds to the
cost and complexity of the arrangement.Accordingly, it is an objective of the present invention to
improve an electrically power assisted
vehicle, in particular bicycles, having a compact power
transmission means wherein assembly is facilitated and
self-alignment of the
