<ABSTRACT>
An interference avoidance system used in conjunction with a vehicular target detection system. The microwave transceiver section (102) of the vehicular target detection system, in which the present invention is incorporated, transmits and receives time-multiplexed microwave signals (104) having at least two channels (frequencies) spaced about 250 kHz apart. The time-multiplexed transmit signal is transmitted and strikes objects (targets) in the environment, and a portion of the transmit signal is reflected back to the antenna. A difference signal having a frequency equal to the difference between the frequency of the transmit and the received signal is generated, digitized, and a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is performed on the digitized difference signal. A microcontroller (106) analyzes the energy spectrum to determine whether there is interference present. If such interference is present, the microcontroller causes the transmit frequency to change until a frequency is found which is relatively free of the interference.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to vehicular target detection
systems, and more particularly, to a method and
apparatus for interference avoidance by changing the
transmit frequency of a vehicular target detection
system when interference is encountered.There is a continuing need to increase the density of
vehicles traveling the world's roadways, and
simultaneously to improve the safety of highway vehicle
operations by preventing highway vehicles from
colliding with moving and stationary objects (such as
roadside obstacles and other vehicles). One means for
accomplishing these seemingly contradictory goals is to
monitor environmental conditions, such as the relative
speed, direction of travel, and distance between
vehicles sharing the roadway, and to use such
information to provide direct indications to the
vehicle's operator of potential danger. It is becoming
increasingly more common for vehicular engineers to
consider the use of target detection systems, such as
microwave radar systems, as the means to monitor such
environmental conditions.A number of vehicular target detection systems are
currently known in the art. One such system is
described in copending U.S. Patent Application, Serial
No. 07/695,951, entitled "Multi-Frequency Vehicular
Radar System", and assigned to the assignee of the
present invention. The radar system described therein
transmits three time-multiplexed signals, two of which 
are used to determine the range of an object (target),
and the third of which is used to determine the
relative speed of the target. The upper and lower
frequencies are separated from the center frequency by
about 250 kHz with the center frequency being about
24.125 GHz. The system transmits the signals, and
receives reflections from targets. By processing the
reflected signal, the system determines the range and
relative speed of the targets.In another vehicular target detection system described
in copending U.S. Patent Application, Serial No.
07/930,066, entitled "Multi-Frequency Multi-Target
Vehicular Radar System Using Digital Signal
Processing," assigned to the assignee of the present
invention, the microwave transceiver generates and
transmits a signal in which only two frequencies are
time division multiplexed. The two frequency radar
system uses a digital signal processor within the
digital electronics section to determine the range and
relative motion of targets based upon the difference
between the frequency of the transmitted signal and the
frequency of reflections of the transmitted signal
subsequently
