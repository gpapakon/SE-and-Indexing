<ABSTRACT>
The rising hinge assembly is for a door in a building. It has a lower portion (1) fastened to the door frame by two bolts (6). A cylindrical lower portion (3) is connected to the bolts, and contains a hinge bolt with a spiral guide surface (11) engaging with a similar spiral surface on an upper hinge bolt. The upper hinge bolt is accommodated in an upper cylindrical housing (2) connected to the door by a single fastening bolt (10). There are coaxial core pieces (16,17) in the hollow hinge bolts.

A door hinge with a selective door lifting and closing function or a pure bearing function without
a door lifting and closing function, consisting of a frame part and a door pat, wherein the one part

(1) comprises a support body (3) with a hinge pin (4, 20, 25) defining an axis (5) and having a
free end surface, and the other part (2) consists of a sleeve body (7) which has an axis (8) which

is coaxial with the support body axis (5) in the assembled state of the door hinge and an
intermediate wall (9), wherein the intermediate wall (9) penetrates into the interior of the sleeve

body (7) in a central region and wherein the sleeve body (7) can be fitted in two different
positions coaxially on the hinge pin by turning the two ends through 180Â° in order to produce or

obviate the door lifting and closing function, wherein the sleeve body (7) has a first bearing
surface (18) at one end, perpendicular to the axis (8), which cooperates with the support body (3)

when obviating the door lifting and closing function, and wherein the support body (3) and the
sleeve body (7) are provided with respective first and second rising guide surfaces (11, 21, 29

and 12, 22 respectively) cooperating in creating the door lifting and closing function,
characterized in that the first guide surface (11, 21, 29) is provided on the free end surface of the

hinge pin (4, 20, 25) and the second guide surface (12, 22) is provided on the side of the
intermediate wall facing away from the first bearing surface (18) and in that at least one of the

guide surfaces (11, 21, 29 and 12, 22) has a helically rising first section around the axis (5 or 8),
while the other guide surface has a section matched thereto cooperating over a large area with the

first section at least over a predetermined range of rotation, and in that the hinge pin (4, 20, 25) is
provided at its end remote from the free end with a second, annular bearing surface (15,31) lying

in a plane perpendicular to the axis (5) and adapted to cooperate with the first bearing surface
(18).
A door hinge according to claim 1, characterized in that the guide surface (21 or 22) having the
first section comprises at least one further section adjoining the first section.
A door hinge according to claim 2, charactenzed in that the further section runs perpendicular to
the axis (5 or 8) or is of falling form.
A door hinge according to any of claims I to 3, characterized by a cap (26) with an axis (27)
which can be fitted coaxially on the hinge pin (25) and which is provided with the first guide

surface (29) in the region of its free end surface. 
A door hinge according to claim 4, characterizcd in that the cap (26) bears on the support body
(3) through a penpheral flange (30) facing the same.
A door hinge according to claim 5, characterized in that the contacting surfaces of the peripheral
flange (30) and the support body (3) are provided with cooperating elements securing against

rotation.
A door hinge according to claim 6, charactenzed in that the elements securing against rotation
consist of frontal teeth (32, 33).
A door hinge according to any of claims 5 to 7, characterized in that the peripheral flange (30) is
provided on its top side with an annular third bearing surface (31) arranged perpendicular to the

axis (27) and cooperating with the first bearing surface (18).
A door hinge according to any of claims 1 to 8, characterized in that at least the bearing surfaces
(18, 15, 31) and/or the guide surfaces (11, 21, 29 and 12, 22) consist of plastics material.
A door hinge according to any of claims 1 to 9, characterized in that the second guide surface
(12, 22) is formed on an insert which can be pressed into the sleeve body (7).
A door hinge according to any of claims 4 to 10, characterized in that the cap (26) and/or the
insert consist of plastics material.
A cap (26) for a door hinge according to any of claims 4 to 11, wherein the cap (26) comprises a
recess (28) of blind bore form for fitting on to the hinge pin (25), a peripheral flange (30) at its

open end for forming the peripheral flange (30) defined as the third bearing surface (31) for
cooperation with the first bearing surface (18) of the sleeve body (7) and an outer lying first

guide surface (29) at the other end with helically rising form adapted to cooperate with the second
guide surface (22).
A cap according to claim 12, characterized in that the contacting surfaces of the peripheral flange
(30) and the support body (3) are provided with cooperating elements securing against rotation. 
A cap according to claim 13, characterized in that the elements securing against rotation consist
of frontal teeth (32, 33).
A cap according to any of claims 12 to 14, characterized in that the peripheral flange (30) is
provided on its top side with an annular third bearing surface (31), perpendicular to the axis (27)

and cooperating with the first bearing surface (18).
A cap according to any of claims 12 to 15, charactenzed in that it consists of plastics material.
An insert for a door hinge according to claim 10 or 11, wherein the insert consists of an element
adapted to be pressed into the sleeve body (7) from the end facing away from the first bearing

surface (18) of the sleeve body (7), which element has a recess of blind bore form for the hinge

pin (4, 20) or the cap (26) which can be fitted thereon and in that this recess is provided at its
