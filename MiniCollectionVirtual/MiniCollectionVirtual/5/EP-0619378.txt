<ABSTRACT>
An object of the present invention is to provide 
adhesion or bonding to a matrix in relation to a composite 

material which is reinforced with vapor-deposited diamond. 
In order to improve bondability to the matrix, hydrogen is 

removed from the surface of vapor-deposited diamond fiber. 
For the removal of hydrogen, the diamond is heated under 

an oxidative atmosphere at a temperature of about 150°C to 
about 800°C, or under a non-oxidative atmosphere at a 

temperature of about 800°C to about 1500°C. The surface 
of the vapor-deposited diamond containing not more than 

about 1 x 10¹⁵/cm² of hydrogen atoms is bonded to the 
matrix of resin or a metal with sufficient strength. In 

order to improve bondability to the matrix (1), the 
surface of diamond (2) is coated with Al, Si or B, or a 

carbide or a nitride thereof (3). In order to reinforce 
bondability, diamond doped with B or N is employed as a 

reinforcing material. The matrix (1) is prepared from a 
metal, ceramics or resin.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a diamond reinforced 
composite material for forming a component which must have 
lightweightness, high elasticity, high strength and high 
heat resistance in relation to an aircraft, an engine, an 
acoustic product or sports goods, and a method of 
preparing the same. In general, a component which must have 
lightweightness, high elasticity, high strength or high 
heat resistance in relation to an aircraft, an engine, an 
acoustic product or sports goods is generally made of an 
aluminum alloy such as duralumin, or a fiber reinforced 
composite material such as a carbon fiber reinforced 
composite material. Well-known examples of the fiber 
reinforced composite material are carbon fiber reinforced 
resin (CFRP), a carbon fiber reinforced metal prepared by 
dispersing carbon fiber in a metal, and various ceramics 
fiber reinforced composite materials prepared by 
dispersing SiC fiber, glass fiber, SiC whisker, glass 
whisker and the like in metals or plastic materials. The  
 
fiber reinforced composite material having high strength 
is increasingly employed in recent years since the same is 
lighter than an aluminum alloy such as duralumin. On the other hand, there have recently been proposed 
techniques of obtaining fibrous, needle-shaped or whiskery 
vapor-deposited diamond from a raw material of a mixed gas 
of hydrogen and hydrocarbon. For example, Japanese Patent 
Laying-Open No. 60-200896 (1985) discloses a technique of 
depositing fibrous diamond on a surface of a substrate 
containing transition metal particles of not more than 
1000 Å in size adhering thereto from a raw material gas 
which is excited and decomposed under decompression. 
Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 1-246116 (1989) discloses 
a technique of obtaining needle-shaped, fibrous or porous 
diamond by exposing a vapor-deposited diamond film to 
plasma containing oxygen, carbon dioxide, water steam, 
hydrogen, halogenated hydrocarbon or halogenated carbon, 
or heat treating the film in an air current containing 
oxygen, carbon dioxide or water steam. Japanese Patent 
Laying-Open No. 2-239192 (1990) discloses a technique of 
etching a vapor-deposited crude diamond film for 
converting the same to a needle-shaped diamond film and 
depositing pure diamond on the needle-shaped diamond film. 
Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 1-246116 (1989) suggests 
such a potential that a diamond reinforced composite  
 
material having an excellent mechanical, thermal or 
chemical property such as high strength, high
