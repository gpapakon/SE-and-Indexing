<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to a process for conditioning yarn which has been
previously wound on a cone, cheese, or similar package.The cotton yarn spinning process necessarily imparts a high degree of line twist
and tension during spinning. This tension is increased by winding the yarn on the cone
or similar core.A variety of processes are known in the art for conditioning yarn to set the yarn
twist. Chemical conditioning and bulk heat setting have been employed to condition
yarn. Conditioning wool yarn with a combination of pressure and steam is also known
in the art. However, such methods are often costly and inefficient in terms of
processing times and energy requirements. Further, such processes are not suitable for
all types of yarn. Therefore, there is much room for improvement within the art.WO91/0358 is concerned with a process for conditioning textile yarn in which a
yarn package is placed within a conditioning chamber approximately the size of the
yarn package, the conditioning chamber is closed and evacuated, steam is introduced
with the conditioning chamber, the steam is maintained at a temperature equal to a
slightly greater than the preselected temperature of the steam and at a pressure equal to
the steam pressure at the vaporisation temperature, and conditioning of the yarn takes
place in the steam for 90 seconds or more, the processing cycle taking about two
minutes.It is an object of the present invention to provide a process for conditioning
cotton yarn which enables continuous production and processing of yarn packages. It is a further object of this invention to provide a process for conditioning
cotton yarn which is energy efficient.It is a further and more particular object of this invention to provide a process
for individually conditioning wound packages of yarn.It is still a further and more particular object of this invention to provide a
process of conditioning wound yarn which includes individual monitoring of the wound
package of yarn.According to the invention, there is provided a process for conditioning a yarn
package to set the twist of yarn therein after spinning and winding comprising the steps
of providing a yarn package having an approximate weight of 0,9 to 4,5 kg (two to ten pounds),
placing said yarn package within a conditioning chamber approximately the size of said
yarn package, closing said conditioning chamber, evacuating said conditioning
chamber, inserting into said conditioning chamber low temperature steam at an
approximate pressure of 26.7 K Pa (200 mm
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A process for conditioning a yarn package (1) to set the
twist of the yarn therein after spinning and winding comprising

the steps of:

providing a yarn package (1) having an approximate weight
of 0,9 to 4,5 Kg (two to ten pounds);
placing said yarn package (1) within a conditioning
chamber (21) approximating the size of said yarn package (1);
closing said conditioning chamber (21);
evacuating said conditioning chamber (21);
inserting into said conditioning chamber (21) low
temperature steam at an approximate pressure of 1 Kg/cm
2
, and
retaining an approximate pressure of 26.7 kPa (200 mm Hg) at a temperature

of 55°C (130°F) to 60°C (140°F) for a two second period of time, thereby
setting the yarn;
restoring said conditioning chamber (21) to ambient
conditions, opening said chamber, and removing said yarn

package (1) thus treated.
The process according to claim 1 comprising the
additional step of providing a flow of air through said

conditioning chamber (21) to facilitate the removal of excess
moisture.
The process according to claim 1, wherein said low
temperature steam is 60°C (140°F).
