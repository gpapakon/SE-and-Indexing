type already known are useful as medicaments, for 
the manufacture of pharmaceutical and cosmetic 

preparations, in the field of biodegradable plastic

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns new polysaccharide esters 
and more precisely partial esters of acidic polysaccharides 
chosen from the group formed by carboxymethylcellulose, 
carboxymethylchitin and carboxymethyl starch (also referred to hereinafter 
as "carboxymethylamide"). The invention also includes the use of 
these new esters and some esters of the type already known for new uses and 
more precisely as medicaments, for the manufacture of 
pharmaceutical and cosmetic preparations, in the sector 
of biodegradable plastic materials and, therefore, for 
the manufacture of medical, surgical and sanitary 
articles, in galenicals and in numerous industrial 
sectors in the place of acidic polysaccharides now in 
use, such as alginic acid, especially in the food 
industry. The invention also includes the articles 
resulting from these various uses. The esters according to the present invention include 
partial esters. In the partial esters 
the nonesterified carboxy groups may be salified with 
metals or organic bases. The carboxymethyl derivatives of the abovesaid natural 
polysaccharides, can be obtained by methods described in 
literature, essentially by treatment of the same with haloacetic  
 
acids, such as chloracetic acid, or their 
salts. The polysaccharides used in these preparation 
methods and which are therefore the basis of the 
new esters of the present invention, may have a 
wide range of molecular weights, such as those of 
the various types of amides, of cellulose and 
chitin present in natural materials. There are already reports in literature of "carboxymethylcellulose 
esters" prepared by alkylation of 
the carboxy hydroxyl with diazomethane or with the 
alcohol corresponding to the alkyl groups to be 
introduced in the presence of a strong acid. In 
this way partial esters are obtained which do not 
however seem to be pure esters. Thus, in the German 
patent No. 957,938 carboxymethylcellulose is 
esterified at about 0Â°C with alcohol (methyl, 
propyl, butyl and octyl) and gasseous hydrochloric 
acid. In the case of methyl alcohol the reaction is 
effected over a period of 48 hrs, long enough for 
the glucoside structures present in the polysaccharide 
to be destroyed and no longer remain intact 
(see: Methanolysis of Polysaccharides; Carbohydrate 
Research 168 (1987) 103-109). The same can be said of the products obtained 
according to the procedure described in U.S. patent 
No. 2,912,430. The preparation procedure for the 
methyl ester of carboxymethylcellulose described in 
LATV;
