<ABSTRACT>
Tyre monitoring device comprising a central unit (36, 41) and, for each wheel, a measurement sensor (17) connected by electrical connection means to a mobile antenna (13, 34, 39, 77) integral with the hub (4, 73) of the wheel as well as a stationary antenna (11, 35, 40, 76) integral with the hub carrier (6, 75) of the said wheel and coupled to the said stationary antenna, the said central unit powering the said sensor with energy and analysing the measurement signals from the said sensor, the said device being characterised in that these electrical connection means consist of electrical conductors (21) passing through a stud (15, 33, 38) by which the wheel is attached to the hub (4, 73).

Device for monitoring tyres, comprising a 
central processing unit (36, 41) and for each wheel a 

measuring sensor (17) connected by electrical 
connection means to a mobile antenna (13, 34, 39, 77) 

integral with the hub (4, 73) of the wheel as well as a 
stationary antenna (11, 35, 40, 76) integral with the 

hub carrier (6, 75) of said wheel and coupled to said 
stationary antenna, said central processing unit 

supplying said sensor with power and analysing the 
measurement signals of said sensor, said device being 

characterised in that the measuring sensor (17) is 
located close to the inflation valve (3) of the tyre 

and in that the electrical connection means comprise 
electrical conductors (21) passing through a fastening 

bolt (15, 33, 38) for joining the mobile antenna (13, 
34, 39, 77). 
Device for monitoring tyres according to 
claim 1, characterised in that the measuring sensor 

(17) is fastened to the end of the fastening bolt (15, 
33, 38) on the outside of the vehicle. 
Device for monitoring tyres according to 
claim 2, characterised in that at the end of the bolt 

(15, 33, 38) an electrical connector (20) is placed 
which ensures the electrical connection between the 

sensor (17) and the electrical conductors (21) which 
pass through the fastening bolt (15, 33, 38). 
Device for monitoring tyres according to 
claim 2, characterised in that the electrical connector 

(20) placed at the end of the bolt (15, 33, 38) is of 
the inductive type. 
Device for monitoring tyres according to one 
of claims 1 to 4, fastened on an axle equipped with an 

antilocking device for wheels, characterised in that 
the stationary antenna (76) is integral with the 

support (71) of the antilocking sensor (72) for wheels.
