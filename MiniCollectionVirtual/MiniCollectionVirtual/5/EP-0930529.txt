<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a recording material
utilizing the heat sensitivity of a diazonium salt compound.
More particularly, the present invention relates to a novel
diazo heat-sensitive recording material developing red to
magenta to violet, excellent in image storability and image
fixing property.A diazonium salt compound has been used for a long time
as a light recording material represented by diazo copy, and
further, also applied recently for a recording material for
which fixing of an image is required by utilizing a property
that it is decomposed to lose function by the action of a light,
and there has been suggested as a representative material a
light fixing type heat-sensitive recording material by which
a diazonium salt compound an a coupler are heated according to
an image signal to be reacted to form an image, then the image
is fixed by irradiation with a light (Koji Safuji, IMAGE
ELECTRON INSTITUTE BOOK, vol. 11, pp. 290 to 296 '1982) ).Further, there has been technical development of a
diazonium salt compound such as improvement in storability and
the like, and application to a full color heat-sensitive
recording material has been reported (ELECTROPHOTOGRAPHY
INSTITUTE BOOK, vol 26, pp. 115 to 125 (1987), FUJIFILM Research 
& Development, vol. 40, p. 13 (1995), Japanese Patent
Application Publication (JP-B) No. 4-10,879 and the like).In a lot of investigations for producing a full color
sensitive material, magenta pigments are produced by using
diazo compound having maximum absorption near 365 nm. However,
with increase of the abilities of a heat-sensitive recording
material, it has been found that design in which sharpness is
enhanced by placing a magenta material having visual
sensitivity on the top layer is effective. For this design,
it is necessary to use a coupler by which a magenta pigment is
formed using a diazonium salt compound which can be fixed at
a wavelength around 420 nm.As a magenta coupler which, in heating, reacts with a
diazonium salt compound which can be fixed at a wavelength
around 420 nm, and develops color, there was used a coupler such
as 1-hydroxycoumarin or the like which develops color by reacting
with a diazonium salt compound having the maximum absorption
around 365 nm in heating. However, in this case, a pigment
exhibiting very broad and brownish color was formed
disadvantageously, and a magenta material could not be formed
even if the substituent on the mother nucleus was changed.For the purpose of improving this problem, a novel
diazonium salt has
