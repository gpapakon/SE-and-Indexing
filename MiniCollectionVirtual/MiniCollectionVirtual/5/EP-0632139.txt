<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the use of a hot-work tool steel (die steel) for primary forming, working and machining of materials, e.g. in die casting, extrusion in the case of die forges (drop forges) or as shear blades, which steel, at elevated temperatures up to 1100 DEG C, has a high thermal conductivity of more than 35 W/m.K. The steel contains     from 0.30 to 0.55% of C   less than 0.90% of Si up to 1.0% of Mn   from 2.0 to 4.0% of Cr   from 3.5 to 7.0% of Mo   from 0.3 to 1.5% overall of V, Ti, Nb from 0.005 to 0.1% of Al. ta
