<ABSTRACT>
An optical system (10) for providing low and high resolution images of a 
patterned wafer (11) to provide for film thickness measurements thereof. The optical 

system (10) comprises a spectrally filtered light source (18) for providing light to 
illuminate the wafer (11). A low resolution imaging system (34) is provided for 

imaging the wafer (11) at a relatively low resolution. A high resolution imaging system 
(37) is provided for imaging a subarea of the wafer (11) at a relatively high resolution 

to create an enlarged image in the same object plane as the wafer (11). An image 
producing system (35) is provided for producing a visual image of the wafer (11) 

derived from the low and high resolution images. The high resolution imaging system 
(37) uses subaperture optical elements, comprising either a small scanning lens or a 

sparse array of lenses, to image small areas of the wafer (11) at higher resolution, and 
the subaperture optical elements (37) create an enlarged image in the same object plane 

as the actual wafer (11). Both areas are then imaged onto the image producing system 
(35) such as a CCD array (35) of a CCD camera (35a), by the low resolution imaging 

system (34) (a lens or reflector) to provide a common or cofocal feature of the present 
invention. This arrangement avoids frequent refocussing to make thickness 

measurements on different parts of the wafer (11). The present invention allows the 
determination of thin film thicknesses of patterned wafers (11), planar wafers (11), and 

silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafers (11), even though the spatial frequencies of the 
patterns are 
radically different in all these cases. The present invention provides the 
ability to make thickness maps of magnified regions within a semiconductor chip as 

well as test pads located in scribe alleys thereon. The use of high resolution multispectral 
subimages significantly increases the speed at which thickness maps of these 

patterned regions are generated. The invention may also be used to measure the that 
also allows determination of position and orientation of the wafer (11) since the wafer 

edges are in focus.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to film thickness measurement systems,
and more particularly, to cofocal optical systems for making film thickness measurements
on patterned wafers.A prior art appearance inspecting device is known from
JP-A-01 110243.Many steps are needed to complete the fabrication of a semiconductor chip and
it is often desirable to measure the thickness of thin film layers thereof to view features
in the 10 to 100 micron lateral size range. This is typically done by scanning a single
point high resolution optical probe across the surface of the wafer and making
measurements sequentially.Typically, a full wafer imaging system requires either a large refractive lens
assembly, a parabola-based reflector system, or the use of a spherical vacuum chuck to
form the wafer into a shallow sphere. In the case of the refractive and reflective
systems, the size of the optical elements approaches the size of the largest wafer that is
to be measured. These large optics requirements lead to high cost and the optical
elements require careful optical design. Forming the wafer into a shallow sphere provides
an excellent way of avoiding high cost optical elements although the deformation
of the wafer during chip fabrication may be viewed with suspicion and this practice will
not work at all if the ambient environment is a vacuum, such as in an automated ultra-clean
wafer process line.Prior whole-wafer film thickness mappers require measurement of multispectral
reflectance over a full aperture of the imaging and these mappers generally fall into two
categories. In the first category, the entire wafer is imaged onto a NxN pixel CCD 
array (512x512, 1024x1024, or 2048x2048, for example) to provide a spatial resolution
at the wafer plane of approximately 200 microns per pixel. In the second category,
a CCD array attached to a conventional narrow-field microscope is used provide high
resolution in the 1 to 5 micron per pixel range. However, covering the whole wafer
requires mechanical scanning of the entire wafer or optical head.Accordingly, it is an objective of the present invention to provide for a film
thickness measurement system that overcomes the limitations of conventional systems.
It is a further objective of the present invention to provide for cofocal optical systems
for making film thickness measurements on patterned wafers.According to the present invention there is provided an
optical system according to claim 1 hereinafter.The present invention combines both aspects of prior art systems
