<ABSTRACT>
The apparatus for homogenising highly viscous fluids includes static mixer elements (11, 12) and, if appropriate, filter elements (6). These apparatus elements are arranged in a casing (13) along the casing axis (15). According to the invention the casing is constructed in multiple pieces; the apparatus elements are monolithic components (10, 20; 60), all or a multiplicity of these components having flange- or lug-like sections (4; 4a, 4b). The components engage by these sections to be anchored in the casing area between casing parts and thus simultaneously form parts of the casing. The apparatus according to the invention is intended for example as a mixer head (1) in the nozzle of an injection-moulding machine or as a melt mixer of an extruder.

<CLAIMS>
A device for homogenising very viscous liquids, having
elements of the device (11,12,6) which encompass static mixing

elements (11,12) and likewise filter elements (6), and where the
elements of the device are arranged in a casing (13) and the

mixing elements encompass a plurality of straight channels which
respectively openly cross neighbouring channels,

characterised in that the casing is constructed multi-sectionally,
that the elements of the device are monolithic

structural members (10,20,60), and that all or a plurality of the
elements of the device have ring-like, nose-like or rib-like

parts (4,4a,4b) which respectively form a part of the casing
section which directly envelopes the element of the device, and

which thereby engage anchorage-wise with the casing area between
the additional casing members (5).
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that the
ring-like part (4) is constructed lying perpendicular to the

casing axis (15).
A device according to claim 2, characterised in that the
ring-like part (4) is arranged in the central area in all or in

individual monolithic structural members (10,20,60).
A device according to any of claims 1-3, characterised in
that respectively at least one rib (4a,4b) is constructed as a

nose-like part in all or in individual monolithic structural
members (10), whereby the ribs extend parallel to the casing axis

(15).
A device according to any of claims 1-4, characterised in
that mixing elements (11,12) encompass a plurality of position-wise

arranged rods (110), whereby the rods of neighbouring
positions cross over one another and the rods form a uniform

angle of between 10° and 70°, preferably of 45° to casing axis
(15). 
A device according to any of claims 1-5, characterised in
that the monolithic structural members (10,20,60) are comprised

of a metallic alloy and are produced by precision casting or by
sinter injection moulding.
A device according to any of claims 1-5, characterised in
that the monolithic structural members (10,20,60) are comprised

of ceramic material.
A device according to any of claims 1-5, characterised in
that the monolithic structural members (10,20,60) are comprised

of synthetic material.
Use of the device according to any of claims 1-6 as a mixing
head (1) in the nozzle of an injection moulding machine or as a

liquified material mixer for the helix of an extruder.
