<ABSTRACT>
A resin composition for injection molding that has excellent 
transparency, and also has excellent strength and sufficient flexibility. The 

composition contains 50 to 99 % by weight of component A, which is a copolymer 
of ethylene and α -olefin having a carbon number of not less than 4, and 1 to 

50 % by weight of component B, which is an olefin-containing polymer. The 
component A has: (a) a melt flow rate (MFR) of 5 to 150 g/10 min.; (b) a 

density (D) of not more than 0.915 g/cm³; and (c) at least one peak of elution 
volume indicated by an elution curve obtained by temperature rising elution 

fractionation (TREF), wherein the peak corresponds to a temperature of not 
more than 85°C, and the elution curve may also indicate substantial elution 

volume at temperatures other than the temperature to which the peak 
corresponds.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of a resin composition in injection molding that has good moldability, such
as spiral flow, and also has excellent transparency, excellent impact strength and tensile strength at normal and low
temperatures, and good heat resistance. It displays a good balance between strength and rigidity, and may be advantageously
used to form injection-molded products.Materials which have been used to produce food containers of flexible resins, such as Tupperware (registered
trademark), include high-density polyethylene, polypropylene, high-pressure low-density polyethylene, and linear low-density
polyethylene.High-density polyethylene is disadvantageous in that it has poor flexibility and poor transparency. As a result of
the poor transparency of high-density polyethylene, when a container made of this material contains objects therein,
the contents cannot be seen or cannot be readily seen through the container. Thus, the practical value of such containers
is reduced, and the range of use to which the containers can be applied is limited.Polypropylene has relatively good transparency, and has good dynamic properties at normal temperature. However,
polypropylene has insufficient strength at low temperatures. As a result, when polypropylene is used in freeze-preservation,
cracking or whitening tends to be caused by the application of local stress. In addition, polypropylene
has poor flexibility, with the result that, when a container made of polypropylene is bent to a relatively great extent, an
irreversible whitening line may be formed, or the original shape cannot be readily recovered.High-pressure low-density polyethylene is another material that has relatively good transparency. However, this
material does not have sufficient heat resistance to be applicable in such uses as microwave ovens. In addition, high-pressure
low-density polyethylene does not have enough resistance to environmental (stress) cracking (referred to as
"ESCR") to be applicable in fields where resistance to acids and bases, resistance to oils, and/or resistance to chemicals
are required. Thus, high-pressure low-density polyethylene only has limited range of application.Linear low-density polyethylene has been introduced as a resin capable of overcoming the problems of the above
resins. However, linear low-density polyethylene has not yet acquired the level of transparency required by the market,
nor does it have sufficient flexibility.European published patent application EP-A-0 492 656 discloses
