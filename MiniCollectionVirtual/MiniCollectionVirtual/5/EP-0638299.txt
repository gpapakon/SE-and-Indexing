<ABSTRACT>
A prosthetic acetabular cup assembly (10) 
includes a single piece bearing component (14) having an 

inner bearing surface (34) for receiving a ball attached 
to a femoral prosthesis and an outer surface (32). 

Assembly (10) also includes a shell component (12) for 
attachment to an acetabulum to replace a natural hip 

socket. Shell component (12) includes an inner surface 
(20) defining a cavity (26) for receiving bearing 

component (14) therein. Inner surface (20) of shell 
component (12) is formed to include an arcuate groove 

(28) therein. A formed wire (16) is situated in arcuate 
groove (28) of shell component (12). Wire (16) is 

configured so that a portion of wire (16) extends 
radially inwardly from arcuate groove (28) of shell 

component (12) to engage an arcuate groove (40) formed 
in bearing component (14) to retain bearing component 

(14) inside shell component (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to hip prosthesis 
assemblies for replacing a natural hip socket. More 
particularly, the present invention relates to an 
acetabular cup assembly designed to retain a polymeric 
bearing inside an acetabular metal shell without the use 
of attachment screws. It is known to provide an acetabular cup 
assembly including a metal shell component for 
attachment to an acetabulum to replace the natural 
socket and a polymer bearing component which is inserted 
into the shell to provide a hemispherical bearing 
surface for receiving a femur ball prosthesis element. 
Often, the polymer bearing component is nonsymmetrical 
and includes a built-up lip around a portion of the 
hemispherical bearing surface to help prevent 
dislocation of an installed femur ball from the 
hemispherical bearing surface. During installation of 
the acetabular cup assembly, the shell component is 
first secured to the acetabulum. When a surgeon 
installs the bearing component, the surgeon selects an 
orientation of the bearing with respect to the shell 
component to align the lip of the nonsymmetrical bearing 
component in the most advantageous position to reduce 
the likelihood of dislocation of the femur ball. 
Therefore, it is desirable to produce an acetabular cup 
assembly in which the bearing component can be attached 
to the shell component in a large number of selected  
 
orientations to provide the maximum degree of 
flexibility for the surgeon. An installed bearing component 
must be secured to a shell component by a retention force 
strong enough to prevent dislocation of the bearing component 
from the shell component. Several different approaches for fixing the bearing 
component inside the shell component are known. These include 
screw shaped profiles in both components, conical-fit-fixation, 
snap-fit-designs using the elasticity of the plastic 
bearing component and lock rings which cooperate with axially 
aligned retaining grooves. In the latter case an outer portion 
of the lock ring runs in a groove of the shell component and 
an inner portion runs in the groove of the bearing component 
(see e.g. DE-A-2301810). It is an object of the present invention to provide a 
locking mechanism which reliably retains the bearing component 
inside the shell component. According to the present invention, a prosthetic 
acetabular cup assembly is provided for receiving a ball 
attached to a femoral prosthesis. The assembly includes a 
bearing component having an inner bearing surface for 
receiving
