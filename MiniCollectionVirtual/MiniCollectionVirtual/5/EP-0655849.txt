<ABSTRACT>
An adaptive circuit (101) is used in the process of recovery of data from 
a signal received from a communication channel (105). This circuit adapts or varies 

its transfer function in response to a first error signal (on 108) derived (by 102) from 
the received signal. This adaptation results in the circuit's transfer function settling 

to a converged state. An auxiliary information recovery circuit (103) receives the 
recovered data and derives auxiliary information therefrom. To avoid the problem of 

false state convergence, the auxiliary information circuit provides a second error 
signal (on 107) which causes an adaptive device (104) to reinitiate the adaptation 

process. In the disclosed embodiment, the adaptive circuit (101) is an equalizer and 
the auxiliary information recovery circuit (103) is one which recovers framing 

information or is an error correction circuit. The inability of the auxiliary 
information circuit to function properly is used as an indication of false convergence 

of the adaptive circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to technique for recovering data using an adaptive 
circuit and, more particularly, to such a technique which avoids convergence of the 
adaptive circuit to a false state. Adaptive circuits for purposes of this invention are those whose transfer 
function can be varied. The process of varying the transfer function can be 
performed in several ways. In one arrangement, the circuit initially operates with 
one or more parameters and the parameter values can be individually varied in a 
manner intended to improve circuit operation. In another arrangement, the circuit 
operates with an initial set of parameters and this entire set is changed for another 
parameter set upon some predetermined condition. Digital receivers use adaptive circuits, such as equalizers, and those 
which provide timing recovery and/or carrier recovery, in the regeneration of data 
from a received signal which has propagated through a communications channel. 
Within the receiver, the adaptive circuit provides a transfer function which 
compensates for the characteristics of the communications channel and thereby 
reduces errors in the data recovery process. Typically, each adaptive circuit varies 
its transfer function in response to a first error signal derived from the received 
signal. The adaptation or adjustment of the transfer function of a circuit used in 
the data recovery process can be performed in two different arrangements. In 
"blind" adaptation, the circuit's transfer function is varied during reception of a 
signal conveying customer data whose value at any time is not known. In contrast, a 
training sequence including one or more a priori known data values can be 
transmitted in certain time intervals and the transfer function of the adaptive circuit 
is varied so as to minimize a first error signal. This first error signal at any time is 
equal to the difference between the recovered data value at that time and the 
corresponding a priori known transmitted data value. There are several problems associated with the use of training 
sequences. First, the transmission of the training sequences requires an interruption 
in the transmission of customer data. Second, the use of training sequences alone 
does not provide adaptation during customer data transmission. Therefore, the 
adaptation is not continuous and the transfer function provided by the adaptive  
 
circuit does not track variations in the characteristics of the communications channel 
during customer data transmission. These
