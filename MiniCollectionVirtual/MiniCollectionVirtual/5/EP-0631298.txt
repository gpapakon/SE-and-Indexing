<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a metalorganic
chemical vapour deposition method utilizing metalorganics
and/or metalhydrides as the precursors for the production of
a semiconductor epitaxial substrate; the substrate is formed
on a single crystal gallium arsenide (hereinafter referred to
as "GaAs") substrate by an epitaxial growth method.Various electronic elements using semiconductors
have recently been developed and steady development in this
industrial field is expected. Until recently silicon has
been mainly used industrially as the basic material but a
compound semiconductor (e.g., GaAs), which has excellent
light-emitting characteristics and high-speed properties, is
steadily finding favour.Various kinds of electronic elements, each having a
desired respective performance, can generally be obtained by
applying crystal layers having the necessary characteristics
to a single crystal substrate by various methods, such as an
ion injection method, a diffusion method and an epitaxial
growth method. Of these methods, the epitaxial growth
method has been widely adopted since with this method not
only can the amount of impurities be accurately controlled,
but also the composition and thickness of the crystal layer
over a wide range.Known examples of the epitaxial growth method
include a liquid phase method, a vapor phase method, and a
molecular beam epitaxial method (hereinafter referred to as
"MBE method") which is a type of vacuum vapor deposition 
method. In particular, since the vapor phase method can
process a large amount of substrate with good control, the
vapor phase method has been widely used on an industrial
scale. Among the vapor phase methods, a metal-organic
chemical vapor deposition method (hereinafter referred to as
"MOCVD method") has recently been widely used.One type of electric field effect transistor is a
high electron mobility transistor (hereinafter sometimes
referred to as "HEMT"), which is also sometimes called a
modulation doped field effect transistor (MODFET) or hetero-junction
field effect transistor (HJFRT), which is important
as a component part of a low-noise amplifier for microwave
communication. The crystals used in electric field effect
transistors can be prepared by growing laminated layers of
a GaAs crystal and an A1GaAs crystal having the necessary
electronic characteristics on a GaAs substrate to provide
the necessary structure by the vapor phase method as
described above.As the materials used for preparing these elements,
GaAs series materials and AlGaAs series
