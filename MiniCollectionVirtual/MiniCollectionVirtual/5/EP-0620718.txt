<ABSTRACT>
The protective cover described has an oblong strip (1) of thin, flexible sheet material, such as tissue paper, and designed to be laid on the top of the seat. The strip (1) of material is compressed longitudinally to form a package and is wrapped in a tear-off wrapping (3). The wrapping consists of a separately manufactured wrapping strip (3) which is wrapped round the compressed protective strip (1) at right angles to the longitudinal axis of the protective strip. When used, the wrapping is torn open at two flaps (A, B) and the protective strip (1) extended, one edge (1b) automatically adopting a position in which it stands out at an angle from an area (1a) intended to be placed on the toilet seat.
