<ABSTRACT>
There are described reaction products from the reaction of olefins with mixtures of optionally alkylated diphenylamines and phenothiazines, these reaction products being essentially liquid at room temperature and suitable as antioxidants. They can be obtained by reacting an olefin of the formula R1R2C=CHR3     (I
>
 with a mixture of compounds of the formulae II and III
