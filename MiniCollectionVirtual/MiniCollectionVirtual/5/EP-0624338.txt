<ABSTRACT>
A body electrode has a carrier layer (1) consisting of an electrode part (2), to which an electrically conducting sensor (4) is applied, and of a conducting part (3) which serves as a connecting part and has an electrically conducting layer (11, 12, 13) connected to the conducting sensor (4), and having an adhesive and conducting layer (17) which covers the free surface of the sensor (4) and is provided for the skin contact. The vulnerability (susceptibility to faults) of the body signals picked up by the body electrode is reduced by providing that an active electrical circuit (10) is inserted between the sensor (4) and the conducting part (3) in a window-type cutout (9) of the carrier layer (1), and by providing the conducting part (3) with supply lines (12, 13) for feeding the operating voltage (UB, earth (frame)) for the active electrical circuit, and with at least one signal line (11). It is thus possible to design the connecting lead (cable) without expensive measures for reducing the influence of disturbances (interference). The preference is for a design of the connecting lead having a conducting part (3) which is connected in one piece to the electrode part (2). Plastic films and paper, in particular, come into consideration as carrier layer (1).
