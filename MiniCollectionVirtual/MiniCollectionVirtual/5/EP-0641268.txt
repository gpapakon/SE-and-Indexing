<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention provides a novel method for the near-complete 
elimination of porosity in ceramic and metal-ceramic products manufactured 
by micropyretic synthesis. More specifically, this invention provides a novel 
method for the near-complete elimination of porosity in ceramic and metal-ceramic 
heating elements, superconducting wires and in products having 
negative temperature coefficients (NTC), products having positive 
temperature coefficients, products for structural use, products for electrical 
and electronic applications and products for magnetic applications. Even 
more specifically, this invention provides a novel method for the 
simultaneous (a) near-complete elimination of porosity in MoSi₂ heating 
elements and (b) creation of a non-oxidizing silica layer on the MoSi₂ heating 
elements. A second aspect of the present invention provides a novel 
method for the rapid sintering and homogenization of products of 
combustion synthesis. More specifically, this invention provides a novel 
method for the rapid sintering and homogenization of ceramic and metal-ceramic 
heating elements, superconducting wires and of products having 
negative temperature coefficients (NTC), products having positive 
temperature coefficients, products for structural use, products for electrical 
and electronic applications and products for magnetic applications. A third 
aspect of the present invention provides a novel method for enhancing the 
adherence of a ceramic or metal ceramic electrical heating element to an 
electrical terminal, and for improving the electrical properties of the resulting 
product. Micropyretic synthesis, also referred to as combustion synthesis or 
self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (the term Micropyretic Synthesis  
 
is preferred for slurries), is a novel processing method for the production of 
intermetallics, engineering ceramics, metal-ceramics, and other materials. 
See United States Patent 5,188,678 hereinafter referred to as the '678 
patent. The technique employs exothermic reaction processing which 
circumvents difficulties associated with conventional methods of time and 
energy-intensive sinter processing. Complicated engineering gear shapes, 
such as shown in the '678 patent, have been successfully produced by this 
technique. Two basic micropyretic synthesis modes are commonly employed, namely 
the wave propagation mode and the thermal explosion mode. In the wave 
propagation mode, the combustible compact is ignited at a point by a heat 
source. After
