The doll according to the invention has a body (1) similar to that of a baby and comprises a reservoir (4), a feeding pipe (5) connecting the mouth (3) of the doll to the reservoir (4), via a non-return valve (6), and an emptying pipe (7) connecting the reservoir (4) to an orifice (8) of small cross-section provided at the location of the orifice of the urethra of the doll. A valve (10) is mounted on the pipe (7) and an energy accumulator (11) is charged by the filling of the reservoir (4) when the valve (7) is closed and pressurises the liquid in the reservoir (4). When the valve (10) is open, the accumulator (11) discharges and expels the liquid in the reservoir (4) through the orifice (8) in the form of a durable stream. Application to dolls simulating urination by projecting liquid in streams.
