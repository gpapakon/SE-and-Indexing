<DESCRIPTION>
 DIAMINO ACID DERIVATIVES AS ANTIHYPERTENSIVESBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to α,ω-diamino acid derivatives which are dual inhibitors of neutral endopeptidase and angiotensin converting enzyme, useful in the treatment of cardiovascular disorders.Cardiovascular disorders which may be treated with compounds of the present invention include hypertension, congestive heart failure and renal insufficiency.The renin-angiotensin system is a complex hormonal system comprised of a large molecular weight precursor, angiotensinogen, two processing enzymes, renin and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), and a vasoactive mediator, -angiotensin II (A π r The enzyme renin catalyzes the cleavage of angiotensinogen into the decapeptide angiotensin I (A I), which has minimal biological activity on its own and is converted into the active octapeptide A π by ACE. A π has multiple biological actions on the cardiovascular system, including vasoconstriction, activation of the sympathetic nervous system, stimulation of aldosterone production, antinatriuresis, stimulation of vascular growth and stimulation of cardiac growth. A II functions as a pressor hormone and is involved in the pathophysioiogy of several forms of hypertension. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is a zinc- metalloprotease which converts A I to A II. Inhibitors of this enzyme, which have been widely studied, include the drugs captopril, enalapril, lisinopril and spirapril. Although a major mode of action of ACE inhibitors involves prevention of formation of the vasoconstrictor peptide A II, it has been reported in Hypertension. 1£, 4 (1990) p. 363-370 that ACE cleaves a variety of peptide substrates, including the vasoactive peptides brady inin and substance P. Prevention of the degradation of bradykinin by ACE inhibitors has been demonstrated, and the activity of the ACE inhibitors in some conditions has been reported in Circ. Res..SUBSTITUTE SHEET 

66, 1 (1990) p. 242-248 to be mediated by elevation of bradykinin levels rather than inhibition of A II formation.Neutral endopeptidase (EC 3.4.24.11; enkephalinase; atriopeptidase; NEP) is a zinc-containing metalloprotease which cleaves a variety of peptide substrates on the amino terminal side of aromatic amino acids. Substrates for this enzyme include, but are not limited to, atrial natriuretic factors (ANF), brain natriuretic peptide, met and leu enkephalin, bradykinin, neurokinin A, and substance P.Inhibitors of NEP lower blood pressure and exert ANF-like effects such as diuresis
