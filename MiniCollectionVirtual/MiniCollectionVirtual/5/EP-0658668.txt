<ABSTRACT>
A tent (10) is provided with a ventilator opening in one 
corner thereof. The tent includes a pair of side panels (11,12) which 

are secured together along a side seam (17) and a top panel (13) which is 
secured to the side panels along a top seam (18,19). One of the side 

panels is provided with an opening (30) adjacent the top and side 
seams, and a screen (32) covers the opening. A skirt (37) is secured to 

the top and side seams and includes a free edge which is spaced 
from the screen. A stiffener (41) is secured to the skirt adjacent 

the free edge thereof for maintaining the free edge away from 
the screen.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to tents, and, more 
particularly, to a tent which is provided with a ventilator 
opening. Tents are commonly equipped with an entrance opening 
which can be closed with one or more flaps. However, when a 
tent is closed too tightly, condensation can form on the 
sidewalls of the tent and bad odors can build up. When the 
occupants of the tent or equipment stored in it come into 
contact with the walls, the condensate will get their clothing 
or sleeping bags wet. This is unpleasant and reduces the 
ability of the sleeping bags or clothing to protect against cold 
condition. Although some tents have been provided with vent 
openings, such vents generally suffer one or more 
disadvantages. For example, the vent opening should be 
protected so that rain does not enter the tent through the 
vent. Also, the vent opening should function automatically so 
that a camper is not required to perform any manipulative steps 
when setting up the tent in order to obtain the advantages of 
the vent. U.S Patent No. 4,265,261 describes a tent with a large 
mesh-covered window in two sides of the tent. A pair of awning  
 
panels can be rolled up at the sides of the window or can be 
unrolled and secured together by Velcro fasteners. A stiffener 
rod can be inserted into the lower edge of each panel for 
holding an apex of the panels away from the window. The awning 
therefore requires various manipulative steps before it is 
operational. U.S. Patent No. 4,898,085 describes a vent which has a 
pointed end which pierces and cuts the tent. The opening which 
is provided by the vent is not screened. U.S. Patent No. 3,164,078 describes a ventilator which 
is inserted into a slit in the tent. The invention provides a tent with a protected 
ventilator opening which functions when the tent is set up 
without any manipulative steps. The ventilator opening is 
advantageously provided in a corner of the tent where a pair of 
side panels are connected to a top panel. A screen covers the 
opening, and a skirt extends over the screen and prevents rain 
from passing through the screen. A stiffener or stay in the 
skirt spaces the skirt away from the screen. The invention will be explained in conjunction with an 
illustrative embodiment shown in the accompanying drawing, in 
which --  Fig. 1 is a perspective view of a tent which is 
provided with a ventilator opening; Fig. 2 is an enlarged fragmentary perspective view of 
the ventilator opening; and Fig. 3 is a fragmentary sectional view taken along the 
line 3-3

<CLAIMS>
A ventilator for a tent having at least one side 
panel, the side panel having an opening, a screen covering the 

opening and attached to the side panel, a skirt extending over 
the screen and having a portion attached to the side panel and a 

free edge having a pair of end portions and a continuous 
intermediate portion which extends between the end portions, the 

intermediate portion of the free edge being spaced from the side 
panel and the screen, and stiffening means secured to the skirt 

adjacent the free edge thereof for maintaining the intermediate 
portion of the free edge spaced from the side panel and the 

screen. 
The structure of claim 1 in which the intermediate 
portion of the free edge of the skirt curves from one end 

portion to the other end portion. 
The structure of claim 1 in which stiffening means 
is a flexible and resilient plastic member. 
The structure of claim 1 in which the skirt 
includes a hem which encloses the plastic member. 
A ventilator for a tent having at least a pair of 
side panels and a top panel, the pair of side panels being 

secured together along a side seam, the top panel being secured 
 

to the side panels along a top seam, one of the side panels 
having an opening adjacent the side seam and the top seam, a 

screen covering the opening in said one side panel and secured 
to said one side panel and to said side seam and top seam, a 

skirt extending over the screen and having a first edge which is 
attached to the side seam, a second edge which is attached to 

the top seam, and a free edge which is spaced from said one side 
panel and the screen, and stiffening means secured to the skirt 

adjacent the free edge thereof for maintaining the free edge 
spaced from said one side panel and the screen. 
The structure of claim 5 in which stiffening means 
is a flexible and resilient plastic member. 
The structure of claim 5 in which the skirt 
includes a hem which encloses the plastic member. 
The structure of claim 5 in which the free edge of 
the skirt curves from the side seam to the top seam. 
The structure of claim 5 in which the intersection 
of said side and top seams forms a corner of the tent, the 

spacing between said free edge of the skirt and the corner being 
greater than the spacing between the portion of the screen which 

is secured to said one side panel and the corner whereby the 
skirt overlaps the screen. 
The structure of claim 5 in which said screen is 
generally triangular and includes a first edge which is secured 

to said one side panel, a second edge which is secured to said 
side seam, and a third edge which is secured to said top seam.
