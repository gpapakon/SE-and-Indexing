<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a double window unit having an inner window frame with inner sash frame and glazing and having an outer window frame with outer sash frame and glazing, the window frames being connected to one another via an intermediate profile and there being formed, between the outer and inner sash frames, an intermediate space in which a roller blind or venetian blind is arranged, said roller blind or venetian blind being arranged such that it can move with the sash frames, and said sash frames being kept at a defined distance from one another, in the region of the lateral members and lower crossmember, by an angular profile. The double window unit may be designed as a laminated window unit with jointly operable sash frames or else with individually operable sash frames.

Countersash window having an internal outer 
frame with an internal casement frame with inserted 

glazing and a glass-holding strip which can be snapped 
into a channel of the internal casement frame, and 

having an external outer frame with an external 
casement frame with inserted glazing and a glass-holding 

strip which can be snapped into a channel of 
the external casement frame, with an intermediate 

section being inserted between the external and the 
internal outer frames, the intermediate section 

establishing the distance between the external and 
internal casement frames, with an intermediate space 

being formed as a result in which there are arranged 
temporary means for protection against sun and heat, 

the means comprising at least one roller blind or 
Venetian blind which can be wound up and down, and an 

angle section is fastened to the internal casement 
frame at the side facing the other casement frame in 

the region of the lateral frame members and the lower 
transverse frame member of the casement frame, the 

angle section covering the intermediate space formed 
between the two casement frames, with the angle section 

also forming the lateral guide part for the roller 
blind or Venetian blind, characterized in that a drive 

gearbox (16) for a roller blind or Venetian blind is 
arranged in the intermediate space (11) between the 

external and internal casement frames (4, 3) and is 
fastened on one side to the upper transverse frame 

member (40) of the external casement frame (4) or to 
the upper transverse frame member (3a) of the internal 

casement frame (3) and the angle section (9) is 
fastened to the external or internal casement frame and 

the internal casement frame is constructed to have a 
larger window opening than the external casement frame 

in order to glaze the external casement frame (4)  
 

through the internal casement frame (3), with the 
external and internal casement frames (4, 3) having a 

like glass groove construction (14) to accommodate the 
glazing (31, 30) and glass-holding strips (33, 32) 

arranged on the room side, and having fitting channels 
(15) which are constructed the same as each other, and 

there can be manufactured from the same sections which 
are selected for the manufacture of the external and 

internal outer frame (2, 1) and the external and 
internal
 casement frame (4, 3) both a window with 
internal and external casement frames (3, 4) to be 

opened and closed separately and a window with interconnected 
internal and external casement frames (3, 4) 

for simultaneous opening and closing. 
Countersash window according to claim 1,
 
characterized in that, to insert the drive gearbox (16) 

for a roller blind, the intermediate space (11) between 
the two casement frames (3, 4) is enlarged by cutting 

out the upper transverse frame member (40) of the 
external casement frame (4) at the side facing the 

internal casement frame (3). 
Countersash window according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that a double-layered roller blind 

with two layers (5a, 5b) is provided as roller blind, 
with a tube (18) being placed in the lower loop (5c) to 

form the end of the roller blind which can be wound up 
and down, the tube being capable of being raised and 

lowered when the double-layered roller blind is wound 
up and down, and with a guide bar (17) being arranged 

between the two layers (5a, 5b) near the point where 
the roller blind unwinds from a roller shaft (50) 

accommodated in the drive gearbox (16), in order to 
spread apart the two layers (5a, 5b) of the roller 

blind. 
Countersash window according to one of claims 
1 to 3, characterized in that pivotal rotation fittings  

 
can be fitted into the fitting channel (15) of the 

external casement frame (4), the pivotal rotation 
fittings being operable by way of a deflection device 

by means of the control handle fitted to the internal 
casement frame for the simultaneous movement of the 

external and internal casement frames (4, 3). 
Countersash window according to one of claims 
1 to 4, characterized in that a respective pivotal 

rotational fitting is fitted into the fitting channel 
(15) of both the internal and the external casement 

frames (3, 4), with the pivot positions of the pivotal 
rotation fittings lying within the fitting groove of 

the fitting channel (15) so that the external and the 
internal casement frame (4, 3) can each be moved 

independently. 
Countersash window according to one of claims 
1 to 5, characterized in that the connection between 

the external casement frame (4) and the internal 
casement frame (3) can be produced by means of fittings 

(7, 8) fastened to the angle section (9) and the 
internal casement frame (3). 
Countersash window according to one of claims 
1 to 6, characterized in that five sealing surfaces 

(20a, 20b, 20c, 20d, 20e) are provided between the two 
casement frames (3, 4) and the two outer frames (1, 2) 

for the arrangement of a sealing section. 
Countersash window according to one of claims 
1 to 7, characterized in that a mechanical ventilation 

device (70) is fitted to the upper transverse frame 
members of the external and internal outer frames (2, 

1).
