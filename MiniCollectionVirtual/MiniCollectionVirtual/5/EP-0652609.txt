<ABSTRACT>
The described raceway consists of a strip-like base (2) 
to which a strip-like cover (3) is engaged by snapfitting 

so as to define a housing space (4) inside which 
three electric conductors (8) are disposed 

longitudinally and parallelly to one another. Each of 
said electric conductors has an anchoring portion (8a) 

buried in a supporting element (9) connected to the 
strip-like base (2), and a wiring portion (8b) extending 

perpendicular to the base itself. A clamp element (19) 
of a connector (20) associated endwise with a branching 

line or another external power line can be engaged to 
the wiring portion (8b) of earth conductor (8).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a raceway for
distributing electric energy and similar services in
civil use premises.It is known that in civil use premises such as dwelling
or business premises, the distribution of electric
energy or other services such as broadcasting;
television and telephone services, is carried out by
arranging the respective conductors within pipes usually
made of plastics, embedded in the walls forming the
room. Also sockets, switches and at all events
different branching devices are housed in boxes, usually
made of plastics too and previously embedded into the
walls. It
is clear that this type of distribution structure is
very rigid and involves a precise planning previously
made in order to be sure that the distribution of the
different services will reach all points of real
interest. It is in fact to be noted that if one wishes
to modify the position of the sockets or light points a
posteriori or at all events to bring one or more
conductors to areas different from those previously
established, troublesome masonry works which are often
very
expensive too are to be carried out.In order to obviate the above drawbacks, distribution 
structures have been recently widely used that, under
use conditions, look like a common base or "skirting
board" and that, disposed along the perimeter of a room,
internally house the electric conductors relative to the
services that are to be installed in the room. In this
manner, electric and telephone systems and other
similar services can be arranged in civil use premises
without
being it necessary to study in advance where the
different apparatuses are to be installed because in
this case a high degree of flexibility is ensured
together with the possibility of adapting said
distribution structures to all new requirements that
may arise even in a later time, after laying of the
raceways.Usually these distribution raceways are made of an
insulating material, thermosetting resins for example,
and consist of a strip-like base to be fixed to a wall,
by gluing or screwing for example, and a cover to be
removably engaged, generally by snap-fitting, to said
base in order to define one or more housing spaces along
which the electric conductors as well as the cables
relating to the services to be installed in the room are
caused to run.It is pointed out that in raceways of recent
construction the distribution of the electric energy
takes place by means of three or more bare conductors
pressure-fitted into longitudinal seats, disposed
parallelly in side

<CLAIMS>
A raceway for distributing electric energy and
similar services in civil use premises, comprising:


a strip-like base (2) to be fixed to a wall of said
premises or of a room;
a strip-like cover (3) to be removably engaged to
said base (2) in order to define at least one housing

space (4) therewith;
a supporting element (9) connected to said strip-like
base and facing the inside of said housing space (4);

and
a plurality of electric conductors (8) housed in said
hollow space (4) and extending longitudinally and

parallelly to each other at said supporting element (9),
each of said conductors exhibiting an anchoring portion

(8a) rigidly connected to said supporting element (9)
and a wiring portion (8b) extending substantially

perpendicular to said strip-like base (2) characterized
in that each of said electric conductors (8) exhibits

first and second ribbon-like portions (12 and 13) which
are symmetrically opposite and joined to each other at a

longitudinal bending edge (14), said first ribbon-like
portion (12) being bent relative to said second ribbon-like

portion (13) according to a bending angle of
substantially 180°, each of said ribbon-like portions

(12, 13) being provided with a respective hooking lip
(15, 16) exhibiting a 90° bending relative to the

ribbon-like portion itself, in order to substantially
define said anchoring portion (8a).
A raceway according to claim 1, characterized in that
said anchoring portion (8a) of the conductors (8) is

buried in said supporting element (9).
A raceway according to claim 1, characterized in that
said anchoring portion (8a) defines with said wiring

portion (8b) of the conductors (8), a substantially T-shaped
transverse section.  
A raceway according to claim 1, characterized in that
a clamp element (19) of a branching connector (20) can

be engaged to the wiring portion (8b) of each of said
electric conductors (8).
A raceway according to claim 4, characterized in that
the clamp element (19) of each branching connector (20)

exhibits a central body (21) from which at least two
arms (22, 23) extend, said arms being disposed

symmetrically with respect to each other so as to define
an insertion seat (24) for said wiring portion (8b) of

the corresponding electric conductors (8), and exerting an
elastic thrust action on the sides of said ribbon-like

portions (12, 13) of the electric conductor itself.
A raceway according to claim 5, characterized in that
the shape of the arms (22, 23) of each clamp element

(19) substantially matches the shape of the wiring
portion (8b) of the respective electric conductor.
A raceway according to claim 1, characterized in
that a longitudinal protection panel (17) is provided

within said housing space (4), which panel is intended
to cover said electric conductors (8) to which it is

detachably engaged in order to prevent an accidental
contact with said electric conductors (8) when the cover

(3) is removed from the base (2).
