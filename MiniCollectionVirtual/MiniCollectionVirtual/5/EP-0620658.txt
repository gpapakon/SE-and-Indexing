<ABSTRACT>
A mobile communication system for communication by a code division multiplex access (CDMA) method between a base 
station and a plurality of mobile stations, is provided with a transmitter whereby the base station diffuses a plurality of information 

series (S1 to Sn) by multipliers (11 to 1n) by use of the common diffusion codes from a diffusion code generating circuit (10), 
and these diffused codes are combined by a synthesizer (30) through transmission timing adjusting circuits (21 to 2n) to effect the 

transmission timing offset multiplexing and to transmit synthesized signals to a plurality of mobile stations at different transmitting 

timings. Each mobile station is provided with a receiver which receives signals transmitted from the transmitter of the base 
station, and inversely diffuses the received signal by use of the same diffusion code as the one used by the transmitter to reproduce 

the original information series.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a mobile communication system which utilizes a code division
multiple access (CDMA) system for communications between a base station and a plurality of
mobile stations.The code division multiple access (CDMA) system is a communication system which multiplexes
information sequences to be transmitted at the same frequency, by spreading them with different
spreading codes for respective channels; for example, in R.C. Dixon, "Spread Spectrum
Communication System," published by Jatec, there are described in detail its system
configuration and capabilities. Now, a brief description will be given of a system called a direct
sequence CDMA system.Fig. 7 shows the construction of a transmitting device in a typical CDMA communication system.
n information sequences S1, S2, ..., Sn are input into multipliers 11, 12, ... 1n, wherein they are
spread by spreading codes C1, C2, ..., Cn from a spreading code generator circuit 2,
respectively. The output signals from the multipliers 11, 12, ..., 1n are added by an adder 3 at
the same timing to generate a transmission signal.On the other hand, the signal received at the receiving side is despread by the same spreading
codes C1, C2, ..., Cn as those used in the transmitting device, by which the original information
sequences S1, S2, ..., Sn are reconstructed. As the spreading codes C1, C2, ..., Cn, code
sequences are usually chosen which are excellent not only in self-correlation characteristic
(letting the time offset between two correlating code sequence be represented by τ, the
correlation value is large for τ = 0 and small for other values of τ) but also in mutual-correlation
characteristic, that is, low in the correlation with other spreading codes (code sequences whose
mutual-correlation value is smaller than a certain value which is offset for any given time).On the other hand, there has been proposed a scheme of repeatedly using the same spreading
code in a plurality of cells in an application of the CDMA system to a multi-cellular mobile
communication system (Pat. Pub. No. 56290/83). It is expected that this scheme will make it
possible to increase the number of communication channels and the system capacity.However, very few classes of code sequences satisfy the above-mentioned requirements for
spreading codes and the number of spreading codes in each class is also small. Accordingly, the
conventional CDMA communication system which assigns a different spreading code to each
communication channel is inevitably limited in the

the received signal with one of said different spreading codes that is allotted to this mobile
station to produce a despread signal, and for extracting information from said despread signal at

a timing corresponding to the delay time allotted to said respective cell to reproduce an
information sequence.
The system according to claim 1 or 2, wherein said transmitting devices of said base
stations in at least two of said cells, which are spatially far apart from each other, use the same
