<ABSTRACT>
Striker for a vehicle lock comprising an anchoring
portion (23) arranged to be fixed to a bodywork portion

of the vehicle and an engagement portion (4) arranged to
cooperate with a lock closure mechanism; the anchoring

portion (23) comprises a metal plate (2) and a coating
(16) of elastically deformable material, which allows

any direct contact to be avoided between the plate (2)
and the bodywork and thereby to reduce the noise

produced during the closure operation of the lock.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a striker for a motor
vehicle door lock.It is emphasized that the term "door" is used in
this description and in the claims in its very widest
sense, to indicate whatsoever moving component between
an opening position and a closing position of an access
aperture to an internal compartment of a vehicle. The
above terms consequently comprise in addition to the
side doors of the motor vehicle, which will be referred
to in the following without the loss of any general
sense, also the hoods or front and rear doors or
hatches.Closure systems for motor vehicle doors are known,
which essentially comprise a lock and a striker
respectively fitted to the door and to a fixed portion
of the bodywork in the proximity of the aperture of the
door itself (or more seldom, vice versa), in such a
manner that on closing the door a closure mechanism
forming a part of the lock cooperates with the striker
in such a way as to achieve a relative locking between
the lock and the striker itself.The striker is generally made up of a metal plate 
serving as an anchor to the bodywork of the vehicle and
of a locking section secured to the anchor plate and
intended to cooperate in service with the lock.
According to a widely distributed form of actuation, the
locking section consists of a cylindrical pin extending
in orthogonal manner up to the plate and secured at its
ends to the plate itself and to an extension thereof
folded back into a 'C'-shape.The anchor plate is generally made of steel and is
secured to the bodywork by means of screws.So as to reduce the noise which is inevitably
produced when the door is closed and consequently the
impact caused between components of the lock itself and
the locking section of the striker, the said components
and/or the locking section are frequently fitted with a
plastic material coating. This arrangement reduces the
noise caused during the impact; the vibrations of the
striker generated by the impact itself are however
transmitted to the vehicle bodywork, in turn forming a
source of noise.WO-A-9532347 discloses a striker assembly as
claimed in the preamble of Claim 1, wherein the metal
plate, designed to be secured to the bodywork of the
vehicle, is mounted within a mounting member, and a body
of resilient structure is molded within the residual
space between the interior surface of the mounting 
member and the exterior surface of the metal plate.JP-A-05039681 discloses a striker assembly for a
vehicle lock, wherein the metal plate is surrounded by a
vibration absorbing
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Striker (1; 1a) for the lock on a vehicle door
comprising an anchor section (23) designed to be secured

to a section of the bodywork of the said vehicle and a
locking section (4) designed to cooperate with a closure

mechanism of the said lock, the said anchor section (23)
comprising a metal plate (2) and a coating (16) of

elastically yielding material surrounding the said plate
(2) in an essentially complete manner, 
characterized in
that
 the said coating (16) is a one-piece member
separated from the said plate (2) and fittable on the

plate (2) itself.
Striker according to claim 1, 
characterized in that

said coating (16) consists of a sheath having a shape
matching that of said plate (2) and fittable on the

plate (2) itself from a side thereof.
Striker according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in
that
 the said plate (2) presents at least one securing
hole (8) for connection to the said section of bodywork

by way of a respective screw, the said coating
comprising a section (25) extending at least partly over

a surface (30) of the said securing hole (8) designed to
cooperate with the said screw. 
Striker according to claim 3, 
characterized in that

the said surface (30) of the said securing hole (8)
designed to cooperate with the said screw is conical,

the said striker (1, 1a) comprising at least one
metal bush (26) located on the said section (25) of the

said coating (16) extending over the said conical
surface (30).
Striker according to claim 4, 
characterized in that

the said section of the said coating (16) extending over
the said conical surface (30) of the said securing hole

(8) comprises a plurality of flexible fins (25) integral
with a single essentially flat wall (17) of the coating

(16) itself cooperating with a face (2a) of the said
plate (2), the said fins (25) allowing distortion from a

pressing position in which they are co-planar with the
said wall (17) of the said coating (16) and an

operational position in which they are arranged in
contact with the said conical surface (30) of the said

securing hole (8).
Striker according to any one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in that
 the said locking section
(4) comprises a cylindrical pin (10) having an axis

orthogonal in relation to the said plate (2) and rigidly 
connected to the plate itself (2) and a sleeve (15) made

of plastic material covering the said pin (10).
Striker according to claim 6, 
characterized by
 the
fact that the said coating (16) integrally defines a

tubular sleeve (31) interposed between the said pin (10)
and the said coating sleeve (15).
