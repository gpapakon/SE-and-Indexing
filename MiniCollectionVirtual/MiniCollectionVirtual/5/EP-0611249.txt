<ABSTRACT>
In a process and an installation for purifying a filter aid which has been enriched at least with organic constituents in a separation process, in particular filtration process, an enzyme or enzyme mixture is fed into a reaction vessel (3). After the enzyme treatment, the dirty water is conducted away and the regenerated filter aid is retained. In addition, the cleaning operation can be reinforced in an ultrasonic device (13).

<CLAIMS>
A method of cleaning a filter aid which was enriched in a
separation procedure at least with organic constituents, characterised in

that the filter aid is dispersed in water and cleaned by means of one or
more enzymes, wherein such enzymes are added that convert the organic

constituents into low-molecular constituents, and that the filter aid is
cleaned in a further cleaning step with the addition of a weak lye with a

concentration of below 1%, preferably 0.3 - 0.5%.
A method of cleaning a filter aid according to claim 1 wherein the
filter aid comprises kieselguhr enriched with organic constituents in a

filtration procedure, characterised in that the filter aid is then separated
from water and the low-molecular constituents.
A method according to one of claims 1 and 2 characterised in that
at least one enzyme is a yeast cell wall-dissolving enzyme.
A method according to one of claims 1 to 3 characterised in that
the filter aid is cleaned in the further cleaning step with the addition of

an oxidising agent with a concentration of between 1% and 10%. preferably 2
- 4%.
A method according to one of claims 1 to 4 characterised in that
the cleaning operation is assisted by irradiation of the filter aid with

ultrasound in aqueous dispersion.
A method according to one of claims 1 to 5 characterised in that
the filter aid is separated from water and the low-molecular constituents in

at least one hydrocyclone or a combination of a plurality of hydrocyclones

in a serial or parallel arrangement. 
A method according to one of claims 1 to 5 characterised in that
the filter aid is separated from water and the low-molecular constituents in

at least one belt filter in the form of a vacuum or pressure filter.
A method according to one of claims 1 to 5 characterised in that
the separation apparatus is a rotary vacuum filter.
A method according to one of claims 1 to 5 characterised in that
the separation apparatus is a pressure sheet or candle filter.
A method according to one of claims 1 to 5 characterised in that
the separation apparatus is a frame filter or a filter press.
A method according to one of claims 1 to 10 characterised in that
the cleaned dispersion is heated to 70 - 95Â°C before re-use.
A method according to one of claims 1 to 11 characterised in that
the cleaned dispersion is dried outside the installation and then passed to

the re-use.
A method according to one of claims 1 to 12 characterised in that
an inorganic filter aid is used.
A method according to one of claims 1 to 12 characterised in that
the filter aid contains kieselguhr and/or cellulose and/or PE-fibres and/or

PP-fibres and/or glass and/or perlite and/or silica gel and/or alpha-aluminium
oxide.
Use of enzymes for cleaning an inorganic filter aid in aqueous
dispersion, in particular consisting of or containing kieselguhr, which was

enriched in a separation procedure, in particular a filtration procedure, at
least with organic constituents, wherein such enzymes are used which convert

the organic constituents into low-molecular constituents and/or dissolve the 
cell walls of yeast, wherein the filter aid is cleaned in combination with

the use of a weak lye having a concentration of below 1%, preferably 0.3 to
0.5%, in a further cleaning step.
Use of at least one proteolytic enzyme and/or at least one
amylolytic enzyme and/or at least one pectolytic enzyme and/or at least one

beta-glucanase according to claim 16.
Use of enzymes according to claim 16 for cleaning kieselguhr-containing
filter aids which were enriched in a filtration procedure with

organic constituents.
