<ABSTRACT>
An improved internal line up clamp (10) is disclosed 
which has an integral back up ring (12). A first set of 

pipe clamps (22) move radially outward to engage the inner 
surface of a first pipe (14). A second set of pipe clamps 

(62) and a set of back up ring segments (202) are 
simultaneously moved radially outward into engagement with 

the inner surface of the pipes. The back up ring segments 
(202) are spring loaded to exert a relatively constant 

back up force against the inner surface of the pipes at 
the weld. In a modification, a fill block (118) can be 

used to fill the gap between adjacent back up ring 
segments when engaging the inner surface of the pipe. The 

back up ring segments support the shoe elements (220). 
The shoe elements are spring loaded to accommodate 

diameter mismatch and non-circularity of the pipe ends. 
The back up ring segments rotate about a radial axis from 

the pipe centerline. Tapered ends on the back up ring 
segments provide for the decrease in ring circumference 

necessary to lower the ring segments.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the welding of pipe, and in
particular to a clamp to align the pipe for welding with a
back up ring at the weld. A pipeline is constructed of pipe sections or pipe
lengths which are welded end to end in the field as the
pipeline is constructed. The ends of the pipes to be
welded must be clamped in close proximity for welding, a
task which is complicated as the pipes are commonly out of
round and have high and low sections which resist
alignment. It is desirable to true the ends before
welding. However, on small pipe with heavy walls, e.g.,
24" (60,96 cm) diameter pipe with 1" (2.54 cm) wall thickness, it is difficult
to generate the force required to round the pipe.Internal pipe clamps have been developed for clamping
the pipes for welding and attempting to true the ends to
be welded, such as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,937,382
to Cunningham et al. issued on February 10, 1976, which
have two sets of extendable clamps extendable to clamp to
the interior surface of the pipes near the abutting ends
of the pipe to be welded. The extendable clamps act to
force the pipe into a more circular configuration for
welding. However, even after clamping it is common to
have pipes of different ovalities and slightly different
diameters.The welding is typically conducted by a welding
device exterior the abutting pipes. It is desirable to
provide a back up ring on the inside surface of the pipes
at the weld. U.S. Patent No. 3,937,382 discloses a back
up ring of this type. Also, U.S. Patent No. 4,556,162
issued to Gwin et al. on December 3, 1985 discloses a
internal pipe clamp with arcuate back up ring segments
mounted on certain of the clamping members. JP-A-56111591
discloses also an internal pipe clamp comprising the technical
features of the preamble of claims 1 and 15.However, a need still exists for a more effective
pipe clamp with a back up ring. The clamp should be
capable of accommodating the mismatch between pipe ends 
and be capable of rapid deployment and capable of
providing effective clamping. The invention relates to an internal line-up clamp and
back-up ring as claimed in claim 1 and to a method of installing
a line-up clamp and back-up ring as claimed in claim 14. For a more complete understanding of the present
invention, and the advantages thereof, reference is now
made to the following description taken in conjunction
with the accompanying drawings, in which:
