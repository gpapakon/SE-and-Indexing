Belt lock, especially for control-cabinet 
doors or similar doors or flaps, comprising 

a flat-bar bolt (10) that is mounted to move 
parallel to the door edge, preferably within 

the arc of swing of the door, and that has 
disposed thereon at least one locking 

section (11) and further comprising a bolt holder (14) 
that is mounted on the door frame to receive 

and hold the locking section (11), and also 
comprising an actuating means for 

longitudinal displacement of the flat-bar 
bolt (10) between an unlocked and a locked 

position, characterized in that to form the 
locking section, at least a portion (11) of 

a length of the flat-bar bolt (10) is twisted 
about its longitudinal axis such that the 

twisted locking section (11) of the flat 
strip profile is disposed at an angle to the 

orientation of the flat-bar bolt (10), and 
the bolt holder (14) is provided with a catch 

(16) that is disposed at the same angle to 
the flat-bar bolt (10) and engages over a 

locking surface (13) of the twisted locking 
section.  

 
Bolt lock according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the locking section (11) of the flat-bar 

bolt (10) is twisted by 90 degrees, so 
that the locking surface (13) of the flat-bar 

bolt (10) is disposed at right angles to the 
orientation of the flat-bar bolt (10). 
Bolt locking according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the bolt holder (14) 

has a U-shaped cross-sectional configuration 
with lateral flanges (30, 31), with the 

crosspiece (15) serving for mounting of the 
bolt holder (14) and one of the two flanges 

(30) has a lug that faces in the direction of 
the other flange (31) and forms the catch 

(16) that engages over the locking surface 
(13) of the flat-bar bolt (10). 
Bolt lock according to claim 3, characterized 
in that that side of the bolt holder (14) 

opposite the catch (16) forms a guide 
abutment (18) for the associated narrow side 

of the locking section (11) of the flat-bar 
bolt (10). 
Bolt lock according to claim 4, characterized 
in that the guide abutment (18) of the bolt 

holder (14) has abutment surfaces (19) that 
are curved in the displacement direction of 

the flat-bar bolt (10) . 
Bolt lock according to one of the claims 3 to 
5, characterized in that the outer side of  

 
the catch (16) has a beveling (32) that is 

inclined toward the oppositely disposed 
flange (31), and the inner corner region 

between the crosspiece (15) and the flange 
(31) of the bolt holder (14) is provided with 

an inclined surface (33) that spans the 
corner region. 
Bolt lock, especially for control-cabinet 
doors or similar doors or flaps, comprising 

a flat-bar bolt (10) that is mounted to move 
parallel to the door edge, preferably within 

the arc of swing of the door, and that has 
disposed thereon at least one locking 

section (11) and further comprises a bolt holder (14) 
mounted on the door frame to receive and hold 

the locking section (11), and also comprises an 
actuating means for longitudinal displacement 

of the flat-bar bolt (10) between an unlocked and 
a locked position, characterized in that to 

form the locking section, at least a portion 
(11) of the flat-bar bolt (10) is twisted 

about its longitudinal axis such that the 
twisted locking section (11) of the flat 

strip profile is disposed at an angle to the 
orientation of the flat-bar bolt (10), 

whereby the twisted locking section (11) is 
additionally angled off and in the angled off 

section (20) is provided as a punched out 
component with a hook-shaped tang (21) that 

in the locked position of the flat-bar bolt 
(10) catches behind a crosspiece (24) of the 

bolt holder (23) that extends at right angles  
 

to the orientation of the flat-bar bolt (10). 
Bolt lock according to claim 7, characterized 
in that the hook-shaped tang (21) is punched 

out with an incline relative to the plane of 
the angled off portion (20), so that there 

results an inclined approach or contact 
surface for catching behind the crosspiece 

(24) of the bolt holder (23). 
Bolt lock according to claims 7 or 8, 
characterized in that the bolt holder (23) is 

embodied as a U-shaped part and the 
crosspiece (24) is held between the U-legs, 

and that the bolt holder (23) is disposed at 
right angles to the orientation of the flat-bar 

bolt (10).
