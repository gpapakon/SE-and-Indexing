<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a mirror mounting for supporting a mirror of a reflecting telescope (mirror telescope), in which mounting is performed in three groups. Each group comprises a fixed bearing and any number of force-variable actuating members. In addition, each bearing and each actuating member is provided with a load cell. In the event of a possible force displacement (force shifting) on the mirror, the signal of the fixed bearing point of a group is compared in each case with the signal of a force-variable actuating member and the possible difference between the two signals is used for a readjusting operation (readjustment).

Mirror support system for supporting the mirror (1) of a mirror telescope,
in which


a minimum of three groups (A, B, C; A', B', C'; A") of force-variable
control components (3a, 3b, 3c; 3a', 3b', 3c'; 13a) are arranged between

a mirror retaining cell (1a) and the lower side of mirror (1; 1'; 10) to
provide at least axial support for mirror (1; 1', 10);
one force-sensing device (5a, 5b, 5c, 5a', 5b', 5c') is located between
mirror (1, 1', 10) and each of these control components (3a, 3b, 3c; 3a',

3b', 3c'; 13a) respectively, for determining the axial supporting force;
additionally to each group of force-variable control components, a rigid
bearing (2a, 2b, 2c, 2'a, 2'b, 2'c, 12a) providing rigid axial support for

mirror (1, 1', 10) is arranged between the mirror retaining cell (1a) and
the lower side of mirror (1; 1'; 10), with the rigid bearings together

supporting the mirror (1, 1', 10) in three points;
each of the rigid bearings (2a, 2b, 2c, 2'a, 2'b, 2'c, 12a) is equipped with
one permanently mounted force-sensing device (4a, 4b, 4c, 4'a, 4'b, 4'c,

14a) for determining the axial forces;
one measuring signal line each (8; 8'; 18) for transmitting a signal from
each of the fixed force-sensing devices (4a, 4b, 4c, 4'a, 4'b, 4'c, 14a) of

one group and one measuring signal line each (7; 7'; 17) for transmitting
a signal from the force-sensing devices (5a, 5b, 5c, 5'a, 5'b, 5'c, 15a)

belonging to one group (A, B, C; A', B', C'; A") of the respective force-variable
control components (3a, 3b, 3c; 3a', 3b', 3c'; 13a) is conducted

to a control system (6, 6', 16), whereby this control system (6, 6', 16) is
designed so that an output signal is generated by obtaining the difference

between the signal from the permanently mounted force-sensing device
(4a, 4b, 4c, 4'a, 4'b, 4'c, 14a) and the signal from the respective force-variable

control component (3a, 3b, 3c; 3a', 3b', 3c'; 13a);
a signal line (9, 9', 19) feeds back an output signal from control system
(6, 6', 16) to the respective force-variable control component (3a, 3b, 3c;

3a', 3b', 3c'; 13a), so that the respective force-variable control
component (3a, 3b, 3c; 3a', 3b', 3c'; 13a) is thereby activated to

perform a balancing motion until the output signal of the control system
(6, 6', 16) is reset to zero.
Mirror support system according to claim 1, in which one control system
(6, 6', 16) exists for each of the force-variable control components (3a,

3b, 3c; 3a', 3b', 3c'; 13a) of one group (A, B, C; A', B', C'; A").
Mirror support system according to claim 1 or 2, featuring an additional
control system (20) which provides a different signal for each force-variable

control component (13a) at the input of controller (16), to be
optionally added to the numerical value of the signal of the force-sensing

device (14a) of the rigid bearing (12a).
Mirror support system according to claim 3, in which an input device (21)
is provided for the control system (20).
Mirror support system according to one of the claims 1 to 4, in which an
additional, lateral anti-rotation mechanism is provided on the rigid

bearings (2a, 2b, 2c, 2'a, 2'b, 2'c, 12a).
