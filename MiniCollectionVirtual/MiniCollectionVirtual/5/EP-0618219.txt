<ABSTRACT>
A procedure for obtaining carbocalcitonin comprising 

the condensation of fragment 1, a docosapeptide 
corresponding to the carboxamide end of the carbocalcitonin 

sequence, conveniently protected and anchored on resin, 
with fragment 2 or 3, a monapeptide corresponding to the 

amino end of the salmon calcitonin sequence, with a ready-formed 
cycle between the Asu and Ser residua, and the 

treatment of the complete peptide skeleton (fragment 6 or 
7) with an acid to free the totally deprotected peptide 

from the resin.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a procedure for solid
phase preparation of salmon and eel carbocalcitonin and all
of its pharmaceutically acceptable salts formed by acid
addition or complexes thereof.The carbocalcitonins are unnatural peptides which are
analogous to the calcitonins but which are very much more
active. Like the calcitonins they have important
therapeutic applications for the treatment of
hypercalcemia, osteoporosis or Paget's disease by virtue of
its ability to regulate the level of calcium in the blood.
These compounds have greater stability in serum, the liver
or the kidneys than natural calcitonins and are more stable
during the process of purification and in storage due to
the absence of the disulphide bridge which is present in
the calcitonins. The literature shows a variety of
synthetic approaches for obtaining calcitonins (see eg:
EP-A-0518295, WO-A-92/19643, EP-A-0232650 and Experientia
32 (9), 1104-1106 (1976).Naturally occurring calcitonins, such as those of eel,
salmon or humans, are polypeptides of 32 amino acids, the
residua 1 and 7 being L-cysteine, whose side chains are
linked to form a disulphide bridge. Carbocalcitonins do not
have L-cysteine in said positions, position 7 being 
occupied instead by L-α-aminosuberic acid (Asu) with the
formula:

the ω-carboxyl group of which is linked to the terminal
amino group of the peptide to produce a cyclic structure.In order to generate the cycle between the Asu side
chain and the terminal amino end in a selective way which
avoids secondary reactions, the Asu side chain must be
protected with a group which is orthogonal to the rest and
to the peptide-resin link. The present invention describes
a procedure for obtaining the new aminosuberic acid
derivative with the side chain protected with the allyl
group and the α-amino protected by means of Fmoc.
This protective group is eliminated by means of
palladium catalysis and is totally orthogonal to the other 
protective groups and the peptide-resin link (Greene T.W.
Protective Group in Organic Synthesis, Wiley, New York,
1981, p.169).Furthermore the invention describes a procedure
(Diagram 1) for obtaining carbocalcitonin using said Asu
derivative, in particular for obtaining the analogues of
salmon and eel calcitonin, the formula of which is
expressed as follows:

where AA25 is Asp or Asn, AA26 is Val or Thr and AA28 is Ala
or Ser.More particularly, the present invention provides a
procedure for obtaining carbocalcitonin based on the solid
phase synthesis using Fmoc/tBu type
