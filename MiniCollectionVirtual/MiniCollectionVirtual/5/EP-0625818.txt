<ABSTRACT>
The invention proposes an electric motor, especially a direct-current electric motor, for a drive unit of a motor vehicle windscreen wiper, of the type including a generally cylindrical motor casing, within which a rotor turns, the shaft of which passes through a plate carrying brushes (18) each of which interacts with a collector carried by the shaft of the rotor, and of the type including an electrical connection module which includes a structure (16) for support of the brush-carrier plate (18), on which the latter is fixed with the interposition of vibration-damper devices, characterised in that the support structure (16) includes a support plate (40) one face (47) of which is fitted with a plurality of damper blocks (60) each of which includes a notch (66) in which a portion (36) of the peripheral edge (34) of the brush-carrier plate (18) is accommodated.

An electric motor, especially a direct current motor, for 
a drive unit of a windshield wiper in a motor vehicle, of 

the type comprising a motor housing having a generally 
cylindrical shape inside which a rotor rotates, the shaft 

of which passes through a brush holder plate (18), each 
brush of which cooperates with a commutator borne by the 

rotor shaft, and of the type comprising a connection 
module comprising a support structure (16) for the brush 

holder plate (18), on which the latter is fixed with the 
interposition of vibration damping devices,
characterised in that
 the support structure (16) 
comprises a support plate (40), one face (47) of which is 

equipped with a plurality of damping blocks (60), each of 
which comprises a notch (66) in which is housed a portion 

(36) of the peripheral edge (34) of the brush holder 
plate (18), the support plate (40) also comprising at 

least one cylindrical annular lateral wall portion (42) 
which extends axially from the said face (47) of the 

support plate (40) and in which a guiding seat (58) is 
formed in which the block (60) is guided to slide 

radially. 
An electric motor according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the seat (58) is an aperture 
enabling the radial introduction of the block (60). 
An electric motor according to one of Claims 1 or 2,
characterised in that
 at least one of the damping blocks 
(60) is made in the form of a locking key slidably 

mounted on the support plate (40), in a radial direction, 
between a locking position in which the portion (36) of 

the peripheral edge (34) of the brush holder plate (18) 
is received in a notch (66) formed in the end transversal  

 
face of the key (60) turned radially inwards, and a 

positioning position of the brush holder plate (18). 
An electric motor according to Claim 3,
characterised in that
 the locking key (60) is made in the 
form of a block made of vibration damping material, the 

said end transversal face of which comprises an opening 
notch (66) extending in a plane parallel to the plane of 

the support plate (40) and the width of which is 
substantially equal to the thickness of the brush holder 

plate (18). 
An electric motor according to Claim 4,
characterised in that
 the block comprises a lower face 
(62) which slides on the said face (47) of the support 

plate (40) and an upper face (64), whose end transversal 
edge (67), which delimits the notch (66), is situated 

radially recessed towards the outside in relation to the 
corresponding end transversal edge (68) of the lower face 

(62) of the block. 
An electric motor according to one of Claims 4 or 5,
characterised in that
 the block (60) comprises at least 
one angular indexing partition (70) which extends inside 

the notch (66) and which is received in a radial slot 
(38) formed in the said portion (36) of the peripheral 

edge (34) of the brush holder plate (18) when the key 
(60) is in its locking position. 
A motor according to any one of Claims 3 to 6,
characterised in that
 each damping block is made in the 
form of a locking key. 
An electric motor according to any one of the preceding 
Claims,
characterised in that
 the support structure (16) 
comprises two diametrally opposite damping blocks.  

 
An electric motor according to any one of the 
preceding Claims,
characterised in that
 the support plate (40) 
comprises electric connection elements (48, 50) 

which are especially connected to the carbon brushes 
(12) borne by the brush holder plate (18). 
An electric motor according to Claim 9,
characterised in that
 the electric connection 
elements belong to a metallic connecting structure 

fixed onto the support plate (40). 
An electric motor according to Claim 10,
characterised in that
 the metallic connecting 
structure is fixed onto the face (46) of the support 

plate (40) opposite that (47) on which the damping 
blocks (60) are provided.
