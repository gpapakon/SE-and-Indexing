<ABSTRACT>
A radial flow hollow fiber blood oxygenator (10) is provided. The oxygenator includes a hollow fiber bundle within an oxygenator chamber defined by a hollow core (14) around which the hollow fibers are wound and an outer housing (12). A gas entry port (22) is coupled to the interior of the fibers adjacent one end of the bundle and a gas outlet (24) is coupled to the interior of the fibers at the opposite end of the bundle. A blood inlet (26) to the core is provided adjacent one end of the bundle, and a blood outlet (40) from the chamber is provided adjacent the same end of the bundle. The direction of blood flow through the chamber is generally radial and the oxygenator includes an inlet manifold and an outlet manifold (39).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to mass transfer devices. In particular,
it relates to a radial flow hollow fiber blood oxygenator including a fiber
bundle, a central core for supporting the bundle and an outer housing,
wherein the core, bundle and housing are generally cylindrical and
concentrically arranged, and wherein a blood providing inlet manifold is
positioned between the core and the bundle and a blood collecting outlet
manifold is positioned between the bundle and the housing.Permeability separatory apparatus or mass transfer devices, including
blood oxygenator systems, have been known for some time. U.S. Patent
3,422,008 (to McLain) discloses permeability separatory apparatus and the
process of manufacture and use of such apparatus. Hollow fibers of a
selectively permeable membrane are wound around a cylindrical core or
along a substantial portion of the length of the core. The core is perforated
or porous along its length or a substantial portion thereof so a fluid can pass
from the interior of the core around or through the fibers wound on the
core. Alternatively, the core may be impermeable for applications wherein
a high pressure fluid is introduced into the hollow fibers. In each
embodiment, a case encloses the core and fibers and provides a region for
collecting fluid that has passed around or through the fibers. Although
McLain discloses various cases and arrangements for winding fibers on a
core (e.g., loose winding, winding fibers directly on the core, or winding
fibers on other removable means, then inserting the core), there is no
suggestion about providing concentric, radially spaced fluid or blood inlet 
and outlet manifolds on each side of a fiber bundle to achieve optimal
delicate fluid handling characteristics, and the best transfer per unit area.U.S. Patent 4,424,190 (to Mather, III et al.) discloses a hollow fiber
blood oxygenator for supplying oxygen to blood flowing on the outside of a
plural layer mat of hollow fibers which carry oxygen inside the fiber
lumens. Blood travels upwardly from the bottom end of the oxygenator
into a central core with a porous wall, outwardly through the core along the
length thereof into and radially through the mat and then into an annular
space between the inside of the outer wall of the oxygenator and the outer
surface of the mat. A blood outlet for conducting the blood out of the space
is at the bottom of the oxygenator.The Mather, III et al. patent acknowledges it is undesirable to subject
blood to unusual mechanically applied forces of
