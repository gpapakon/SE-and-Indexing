<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to the treatment of a condition characterized as serotonin depletion illness (SDI) with compositions and methods comprising a serotonin agonist in combination with sulpiride. SDI is an illness which may be commonly identified by fatigue, irritability, sleep disorders and pain in afflicted patients. Preferred serotonin agonists for use in the treatment of SDI are tricyclic antidepressants, maprotiline and mianserin.

<DESCRIPTION>
PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION AND METHOD OF TREATMENT FOR SEROTONIN DEPLETION ILLNESSField of the InventionTHIS invention relates to the treatment of patients presenting with synaptic fatigue related conditions and to pharmaceutical compositions for use in such treat- ent. More particularly this invention relates to the treatment of a condition which the inventor has characterised as serotonin depletion illness [herein¬ after referred to as SDI] .Background of the InventionVarious studies, hypothesis, laboratory findings, signs and symptoms point to the fact that SDI is a central neurochemical disorder involving the all important mid- line raphe nucleus in the medulla, the RAS, hypothalmus and the entire autonomic nervous system.SDI is a physical condition found mainly in urban societies where an abundance of sensory input [popular¬ ised as stress] exhausts the midline raphe nucleus in its production of serotonin [5-Hydroxytryptamine] and in this way causes sleep disturbances, hyperalgesia [defective pain modulation] and alteration of mood [depression and irritability].The clinical manifestation of this illness is normally associated with the following symptoms:MAJOR CRITERIA1. Fatigue.2. Irritability.3. Sleep disorder.4. Pain:SUBSTITUTE SHEET 

 [a] Headache.[b] General body aches and pains.[c] Low backache.[d] Abdominal pain. [e] Dysmenorrhoea.[f] Joint pains.[g] Chest pain, [h] Otalgia.[i] Neck pain. [j] Scapular pain.MINOR CRITERIA1. Flatulence.2. Paraesthesia.3. Subjective swelling. 4. Cold extremities.5. Nausea.6. Dizzy spells.7. Burning feet.8. Restless legs. 9. Catarrh.10. Palpitations.11. Tremor.12. Tight chest and throat.13. Neck stiffness. 14. Oliguria.15. Irritable bladder.16. Dyspnoea.17. Pruritis ani.18. Diarrhoea/constipation. 19. Reduced mental ability:[a] Concentration loss.[b] Thought process inhibition.[c] Indeciciveness.[d] Sluggishness.SUBSTITUTE SHEET 

 [e] Sense of failure.20. Behavioural alterations:[a] Inactivity.[b] Inhibitedness. [c] Unsociability.[d] Sexual, dietary and physical alterations.[e] Mood swings.The inventor is of the view that conditions such as myofascial syndrome, fibromyalgia, fibrositis, masked depression, yuppie flu [epidemic myalgic encephalomyel- itis syndrome] and a host of chronic pain conditions as well as indications of altered immunity may be placed under one umbrella, namely that of SDI. cordingly it is suggested that SDI should be included in the differential diagnosis of a multiplicity of conditions which include:1. Musculoskeletal conditions:[a]

CLAIMS :
1. The use of a serotonin agonist in combination with sulpiride in the production of an intravenous infusion composition for use in the treatment of SDI in a patient.
2. The use of claim 1 wherein the serotonin agonist is selected from the group consisting of the tri- cyclic anti-depressants, maprotiline hydrochloride and mianserin hydrochloride.
3. The use of claim 2 wherein serotonin agonist is amitriptyline.
4. An intravenous infusion composition suitable for use in the treatment of SDI comprising amitrip¬ tyline in combination with sulpiride in a physio- logically acceptable carrier.
5. The composition of claim 4 wherein the carrier is a normal saline solution.
6. An intravenous infusion product in unit dosage form for use in the treatment of SDI, comprising a container and an hypodermic needle in fluid connection therewith, the container containing a composition comprising between 10 and 50 mg amitriptyline and between 50 and 200 mg sulpiride in a normal saline carrier.
7. The product of claim 6 as a three day treatment course comprising three infusion products in unit dosage form, the three containers each containing about 50 millilitres of normal saline solution, about 100 mg sulpiride and respectively about 10 to 40 mg .amitriptyline.
SUBSTITUTE SHEET 


8. A method of treating SDI by the simultaneous or sequential intravenous infusion of a serotonin agonist and sulpride.
9. The method of claim 8 comprising the steps of intravenously administering to a patient suffering from SDI a combination of sulpiride and amitriptyline in the quantities and by use of the product claimed in claim 7 over a period of three days.
