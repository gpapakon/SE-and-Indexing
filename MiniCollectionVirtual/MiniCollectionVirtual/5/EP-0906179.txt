<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to polymer blends which can be used both in foamed and unfoamed states as a replacement for conventional EPDM and other elastomers. The composition of the blend includes a single-site catalyzed polyolefin resin having a density of below 0.878 g cm
<
-3
>
 and up to 40 weight percent a polyolefin including ethylene and propylene. The polymer blend is cross-linked. The polymer blends are formable and foamable. The use of sulfur to vulcanize the polymer blend is not necessary. The polymer blends can be used to make foam for floatation or for making gaskets.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to cross-linked polymer
blends including single-site initiated polyolefin resins
and polyolefins including ethylene and propylene.Polymer blends that can be formed (i.e.,
thermoformed or pressure-formed) are useful in a number
of applications, particularly, when the polymer blends
have good flexibility properties, high thermal stability,
and are foamable. For example, these materials can be
used as components in floatation devices for water sports
or as sealing or gasket components in, e.g., the
automotive industry. Traditionally, the physical
properties required by these types of applications
suggest the use of high density foams.In general, polymer blends with these properties
are based, in part, on cross-linked
ethylene-propylene-diene monomer (EPDM) terpolymers or
ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymers. These materials
generally contain other additives, such as plasticizers,
to add to their flexibility. Thermal stability is
typically achieved by sulfur vulcanization of the
compositions. However, plasticizers can leach out of the
materials over time which can make the materials less
flexible and the sulfur additives can make the material
less desirable for environmental reasons.EP 0702032 describes cross-linked polymeric foam compositions comprising
cross-linked polyolefin co-polymers including ethylene polymerised with at least
one alpha-unsaturated C3 - C20 olefinic comonomer.The invention features a gasket formed of a polymer blend as defined in claim 1. In another aspect, the invention features a method
of making a gasket, using a cross-linked polymer blend according to claim 15.In preferred embodiments, the step of cross-linking
the polymer blend includes reacting the polymer
blend with a peroxide. In other preferred embodiments,
the method further includes the step of expanding the
polymer mixture to form a foam. It is preferred that the
step of expanding the polymer mixture include compression
molding the polymer mixture at increased temperature and
pressure. Preferably, compression molding comprises the
steps of pressing the polymer mixture using a high
tonnage press at a temperature of between 275 and 320°F (135-160°C)
and a pressure of between 250 and 2500 psi (1.72-17.2 MPa) for between 20
and 90 minutes followed by heating the polymer mixture at
a temperature between 300 and 380°F (149-193°C). The step of heating
the polymer mixture further preferably includes pressing
the blend using a medium tonnage press at a pressure of
between 250 and 1500 psi (1.72-10.34 MPa).
