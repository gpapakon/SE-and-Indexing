A steering column assembly, particularly for motor vehicles, 
of the type comprising a column body (1; 21; 41) in which is 

arranged a tubular steering shaft (2; 22; 42), one end of 
which is adapted to be joined to the rest of the steering 

mechanism of the vehicle (3; 23; 45) and the other end of 
which is adapted to receive a steering wheel (4; 24; 43), 

and an air bag module comprising an air bag (6; 26; 49) 
arranged in a central steering wheel cushion (5; 25; 48) and 

associated with a gas generator (7; 27; 50) for inflating 
the bag, characterised in that the air bag module is divided 

into two parts, one of which comprises the bag (6; 26; 49) 
and is arranged in the central cushion and the other of 

which comprises the gas generator (7; 27; 50) and is housed 
in the column assembly, near the end thereof which has been 

adapted to be joined to the rest of the vehicle's steering 
mechanism, and in that the two parts of the module are 

connected to one another via a tubular element (2; 22; 47) 
of the steering column assembly. 
An assembly according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
steering wheel (4; 24) and the central cushion (5; 25) are 

supported by the steering shaft (2; 22) and in that the 
tubular element is formed by the steering shaft (2; 22). 
An assembly according to claim 2, characterized in that the 
gas generator (7) is arranged in the shaft. 
An assembly according to claim 2, characterized in that the 
gas generator (27) is arranged around the shaft and in that 

it comprises holes (31, 32) for linking the generator and 
the inside of the shaft, the shaft comprising a sealing plug 

(34) at the end opposite its end connected to the air bag 

(26).  
 
An assembly according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
central cushion (48) is supported by a fixed supporting tube 

(47) arranged in the steering shaft (42) and in that the 
tubular element is formed by this cushion-supporting tube. 
An assembly according to claim 5, characterised in that the 
gas generator (50) is arranged in the supporting tube. 
An assembly according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that a particle filter (11; 33; 53) is 

interposed between the gas generator and the air bag in the 
tubular element.
