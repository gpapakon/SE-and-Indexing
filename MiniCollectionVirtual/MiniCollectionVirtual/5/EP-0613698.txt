<ABSTRACT>
A pleural drainage probe which consists of a 
flexible tube (1) into which a guide element (13) may be 

inserted and which is provided with at least two axially 
separated inflatable peripheral chambers (2,3) which are 

both connected to the outside via independent capillary 
conduits (4,5) made in the wall of the tube (1), each of 

said conduits, after branching (6,7) close to the end of 
the tube (1), terminating in broadenings (8) which enable 

the air supply means to be connected, each of the branches 
(7,8) being provided with an anti-return valve (9).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pleural drainage 
probe which includes its own means of fixation to the 
body of the patient, said means being easy to implant and 
extract without causing any inconvenience or pain. More particularly, the probe of the invention is of 
the type that consists of a flexible tube into which a 
guide element can be inserted to help the probe to penetrate 
the body of the patient and which is extracted once 
the tube has reached the area which is to be drained. Until now the tube used in pleural drainage operations 
was fixed to the skin of the patient by means of 
suture stitches. With this fixing system the patient 
feels the effects during post-operation and it is impractical 
since the suture stitches can come undone as a 
result of abrupt movements. Furthermore, when the position  
 
of the tube has to be changed the stitches have to be 
removed so that it can be re-fixed in the right position 
using the same system, thus causing the patient to suffer 
unnecessary pain and inconvenience. The object of the present invention is a probe of 
the type described, including its own means of fixation 
to the body of the patient, said means not causing any 
inconvenience or pain and making the use of suture 
stitches unnecessary. The probe of the invention is characterized in that 
the flexible tube of which it consists is provided externally 
with two inflatable peripheral chambers axially 
separated from each other along the tube. An independent 
conduit of capillary section leads from each of these 
chambers and runs along the wall of the tube towards the 
end of the probe at which the guide rod is inserted, both 
tubes opening to the outside close to said end via 
branches which each incorporate an anti-return valve that 
enables air to pass in the input and output direction as 
desired. Furthermore, these branches terminate in broadenings 
adapted for joining air supply means which may 
consist, for example, of a syringe. The other end of the tube which constitutes the 
probe terminates in a rounded or conical end which is 
provided with through-holes in its wall. One of the two peripheral chambers of the probe of 
the invention is inflated depending on the depth or 
penetration of the probe into the body of the patient. 
When a deep point has to be reached, in order to extract 
air for example, the outermost chamber is inflated, 
whereas if the depth to be reached is less and the probe 
does not penetrate as far, the innermost chamber is  
 
inflated. The relevant chamber
