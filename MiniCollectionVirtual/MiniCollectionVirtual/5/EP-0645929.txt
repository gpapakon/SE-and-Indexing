<ABSTRACT>
A track-pairing technique for use in recording and retrieving video 
data is described. By alternating between a pair of tracks when recording 

and retrieving data segments of a data stream, a video server (12) or 
recording disk (24) is able to take advantage of zone bit recording when 

recording, yet data transfer rate upon retrieval is independent of track 
location. As a result, guaranteed throughput is substantially improved and 

the number of data streams which can be simultaneously sourced increases. 
The inventive track-pairing technique can be embodied in a video server, a 

recording disk, a data layout method, or a data retrieval method.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a video-on-demand storage server 
and, more particularly, to a method and apparatus for optimizing data 
retrieval performance in disk drives exploiting zone bit recording. Currently, video tapes may be rented at video rental stores. 
Typically, the video tapes are rented for one to three nights at a time. The 
subject matter of the available tapes include movies, entertainment games, 
and the like. There are certain disadvantages in renting video tapes from video 
rental stores. First, the selection of movies at each video rental store is 
limited. Second, the number of rentable copies of each particular video tape 
is also limited. As a result, all the people seeking to rent a recently released 
popular movie will not be able to rent a video tape containing a copy of the 
movie. Hence. the availability of the video tapes cannot be guaranteed. 
Third, the people renting video tapes are required to go to the video rental 
store to select and rent a video tape, view the tape, and then return to the 
video rental store to return the tape. It is time consuming and typically 
inconvenient for the user to frequent the video store twice in order to view a 
video tape. Lately, video-on-demand (VOD) systems have received a lot of 
attention because of their ability to solve these problems. In general, a 
VOD system would include a central storage server having numerous videos  
 
stored in digital form, a controller, a communication network, and customer 
equipment boxes. A customer would select an available movie (i.e., movie 
stored in the storage server) using the customer's equipment box. The 
controller would then transmit the selected movie over the communication 
network to the customer's equipment box. The customer then views the 
movie on his/her television without ever having to enter a video rental store. Although file servers exist for applications such as on-line transaction 
processing, the architecture of the file servers is not well suited to VOD 
applications. As an example, on-line transaction processing tends to transfer 
numerous unrelated small pieces of data whose identities are disclosed only 
when urgently needed, whereas VOD servers are required to concurrently 
provide a large number of smooth streams of data. The rate of each stream 
is currently several times lower than the sustained transfer rate of a single 
magnetic disk drive. For example, a typical stream rate is between 1.5 and 
6 Megabits per second, whereas the sustained transfer rate of a

A video storage server system (12) for storing video data for a 
plurality of video titles, comprising: 

   at least one disk drive (22) for storing video data for a plurality of 
video titles in a zone bit recording format, the video data for each of the 

video titles includes successive data segments that are alternately recorded in 
two different tracks, and 

   a controller (20) for controlling the transmission of certain video data 
onto a communication network. 
A video storage server system as recited in claim 1, 
   wherein said video storage server (12) comprises a plurality of disk 

drives (22), and 
   wherein the two different tracks having the successive data segments 

alternately recorded thereon are on the same or different disk drives. 
A video storage server system as recited in claims 1 or 2, wherein the 
two different tracks form a track pair, 

   wherein said at least one disk drive (22) comprises at least one 
recording disk (24), and 

   wherein when a first track of the track pair is TR1, then a second 
track of the track pair is TR2=N-TR1, where N is the number of tracks on 

the recording disk being paired. 
A method for storing a stream of video data to a storage system so as 
to obtain a nearly constant data transfer rate when reading the video data 

from the storage system, comprising: 

(a) partitioning (28, 44) data associated with a certain video title into 
data segments; 
(b) identifying (30, 42) two different tracks of the storage system to 
store the data segments of the certain video title; and 
(c) recording (32) the data segments to the two different tracks of the 
storage system using zone bit recording by alternating between the two 

different tracks. 
A method as recited in claim 4, wherein if a first track of the two 
different tracks is TR1, the second of the tracks is TR2=N-TR1 + 1, where 

the tracks are numbered 1, 2, ..., N, and N is the total number of tracks 
being paired. 
A method as recited in claims 4 or 5, 
   wherein said recording (c) records a first data segment to a first track 

of the two different tracks, and records a second data segment to a second 
track of the two different tracks, and 

   wherein the two different tracks are associated with one another as a 
pair, and the average of the disk transfer rates for a data segment read from 

each is substantially constant regardless of track position. 
A method as recited in claims 4, 5 or 6, wherein the storage system 
comprises a plurality of disk drives (22), and

 
   wherein the two different tracks are on different disk drives, and the 

data segments of the stream of video data are striped across the plurality of 
disk drives using the two different tracks on the different disk drives, 

respectively. 
A method as recited in claims 4, 5, 6 or 7, wherein the data segments 
correspond to a portion of individual schedule rounds for a data stream, and 

the portion of the individual schedule rounds varies with the track position 
where the portion is to be recorded. 
A method for retrieving stored video data from a disk drive, the video 
data for a data stream being stored as contiguous segments alternatively over 

a pair of track regions, the pair of tracks including an inner track region and 
an outer track region, the inner track region includes at least one inner track 

and the outer track region includes at least one outer track, said method 
comprising: 


(a) determining (34) whether a data stream needs a data segment of 
the video data; and 
(b) when the data segment is needed, retrieving (36) the data segment 
alternately from the inner track region and the outer track region. 
A method as recited in claim 9, wherein the video data is stored on a 
magnetic disk drive (22) in a zone bit recording format, 

   wherein the data segments retrieved from the inner and outer tracks as 
a pair results in a nearly constant data transfer rate regardless of track 

position, and
 

   wherein the inner track region and the outer track region comprise at 
least one pair of tracks, wherein the pair of tracks includes a first track and 

a second track, when the first track is TR1, then the second track is TR2 = 
N-TR1, where the tracks are numbered from 1, 2, ..., N, and N is the 

number of tracks on the disk being paired.
