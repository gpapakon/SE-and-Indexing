<ABSTRACT>
A process for progressively manufacturing cutting 
edge needles or wire members. Needle blanks or wire 

blanks are cut from a roll of wire and mounted to a 
carrier strip. The carrier strip and needles are moved 

through a succession of coining dies and at least one 
trimming die, wherein the first coining die is an open 

coining die and the one or more successive coining dies 
are closed coining dies. The needle blanks or wir
e 
members are optionally curved, heat treated and 

electrochemically treated resulting in cutting edge 
needles or wire members formed without a grinding step and 

without adversely affecting point ductility.

<DESCRIPTION>
The field to which this invention pertains is
wire members having a cutting edge such as surgical
needles. More specifically,
the invention relates to
a method of manufacturing
cutting edge surgical needles.Surgical needles and methods of manufacturing surgical
needles are well known in the art. Surgical needles
typically consist of a shaft-like member, which may be
curved or straight. The member has a distal piercing
point and a proximal end for mounting or receiving a
suture. Surgical needles are typically classified as
either taper point needles, wherein the diameter of the
shaft tapers to a piercing point, or cutting edge needles
wherein the needles have various cutting edges along with
piercing points to assist in penetrating various types of
tissue. Surgical sutures may be attached or mounted to
the proximal ends of surgical needles in various ways.
One common way is to have a channel formed into the
proximal end of the needle. The channel end typically is
die-formed into a needle during the manufacturing process
and consists of a U-shaped cavity. When a surgical suture
end or tip is placed into the cavity, the channel end is
hit with a die one or more times under pressure forcing
the sidewalls to close tightly about the suture tip to
prevent the suture from separating from the needle. The
process of mounting a suture tip to the proximal end of a
needle is known in the art as swaging. Another manner in
which a suture may be mounted to a surgical needle is by
drilling a hole, commonly referred to in the art as a 
blind hole, into the proximal end of the needle. This can
be done using conventional mechanical drilling apparatuses
or conventional laser drilling apparatuses. The end or
tip of a suture is then inserted into the drilled hole and
the section of the proximal end of the needle surrounding
the blind hole is swaged in a conventional manner by
compressing the end one or more times with various
conventional dies. It is also known to mount sutures to
surgical needles using conventional adhesives.Surgical needles are conventionally manufactured from
surgical grade alloys such as surgical grade stainless
steel, which are purchased from manufacturers in the form
of rod or finished wire. The rod is typically drawn into
finished wire and rolled onto a spool. The initial step
in the manufacture of surgical needles is to remove the
wire from the spool, degrease or clean if required, and
then cut the wire into sections known as needle blanks.
The needle blanks are the precursors of the finished
surgical
