<ABSTRACT>
A tapered IDT function is provided in an IDT of a SAW device having fingers substantially parallel to one another by applying a static electric field to a piezoelectric substrate of the SAW device to generate in the substrate a strain which varies across the aperture of the IDT, thereby varying a center frequency of the IDT across the aperture of the IDT. The electric field can be perpendicular to the fingers and created by applying a dc voltage between conductors at least one of which can be tapered or angled, either in the region of the IDT to produce a strain directly or adjacent to the IDT to produce a strain indirectly, or it can be parallel to the fingers, two fields with opposite directions being created at the two sides of the IDT.

<DESCRIPTION>
 SURFACE WAVE DEVICES WITH STATIC ELECTRIC FIELDThis invention relates to surface wave devices. The term "surface wave" is used herein to embrace surface acoustic waves (SAWs) , including leaky SAWs, surface skimming bulk waves, and similar acoustic waves, and is abbreviated to SAW below.Background of the InventionIt is known to provide a SAW device with tapered interdigital transducers in order to provide a changing SAW wavelength, and hence a changing center frequency for SAW propagation, across the aperture of the SAW device, thereby to provide the SAW device with a relatively broad fractional bandwidth. The taper may be linear, hyperbolic, or in accordance with some other function, and tapers can be applied to IDTs of different types, for example to bidirectional IDTs and to SPUDTs (single phase unidirectional transducers) with and without known weighting techniques such as withdrawal weighting, finger position or width weighting, etc. SAW device filters using tapered IDTs can have advantages of low loss, a flat pass band, and good out-of-band rejection.Tapered IDTs and SAW devices using them have also been referred to as having slanted finger geometries, but the term "slanted" is not used further herein to avoid potential confusion with other and different types of SAW device, such as slanted array compressors (SACs) .The gradually changing finger pitch across the aperture of a known tapered IDT requires a substantially increased resolution of the processes used for producing the IDT. For SAW devices intended for operation at high 

frequencies, such an increased resolution becomes increasingly difficult or impossible to provide.For example, a SAW device for use as an RF (radio frequency) filter at a frequency of the order of 2 GHz may have a finger width of about 0.3 μm. To provide such an IDT with a tapered finger geometry with for example a fractional bandwidth of 1%, the finger width would vary from about 0.3 urn across the aperture of the IDT by ±0.0015 μm. The resolution limits of known SAW device processes can not practically meet the requirements for such a tapered finger geometry.It would be desirable to be able to obtain the advantages of tapered IDTs in high frequency SAW devices, but this has not been possible in view of the resolution limits and requirements discussed above.Summary of the InventionAccording to one aspect of this invention, a method of providing a tapered IDT function in an IDT of a SAW device having fingers substantially parallel to one another comprises applying a
