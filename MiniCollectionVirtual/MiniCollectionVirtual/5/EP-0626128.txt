<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for cutting crop, 
provided with a frame (2), with cutting means (3) supported by the 

frame, which 
are rotatable about upwardly extending axes of rotation, with co-acting 

crushing rollers (6,7) arranged behind the cutting means, which are 
rotatable 

about at least substantially horizontal axes of rotation, and with a 
drum (10), 

which is rotatable about an at least substantially horizontal axis of 
rotation, which is arranged behind the crushing rollers, in the path of 

crop moving from the crushing rollers towards the rear during operation. 
Guide plates (9) are provided between the crushing rollers and the drum, 

by 
means of which the crop is deflected in a direction transversely to the 

direction of movement of the device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for cutting crop, 
provided with a frame, with cutting means supported by the frame, 
which are rotatable about upwardly extending axes of rotation, with 
co-acting crushing rollers arranged behind the cutting means, which 
are rotatable about at least substantially horizontal axes of 
rotation, with a drum which is rotatable about an at least 
substantially horizontal axis of rotation, which is arranged behind 
the crushing rollers, in the path of crop moving from the crushing 
rollers towards the rear during operation and with a guide plate. Devices of this type are known, for example from DE-A-2653463 
and GB-A-2169184. With said known devices the drums ensure 
that the crop cut off by the cutting means and flung rearwards is 
spread over a strip of ground from which the crop has been cut. When 
these constructions are used, there may be a danger that part of the 
cut-off crop is flung onto crop which has not been cut yet, on the 
strip of ground adjacent to the strip of ground from which the crop is 
being cut. In order to avoid this drawback it has been proposed in 
DE-A-2653463 to arrange the drum, which is disposed behind the 
crushing rollers and which is rotatable about an at least 
substantially horizontal axis of rotation, in such a manner that its 
axis of rotation includes an angle with the intended direction of 
movement of the mowing device during operation, so that the drum will 
also effect a displacement of the crop in a direction transversely to 
the intended direction of movement of the device. In practise this 
will lead to a complicated supporting structure for the drum, whilst 
also the design of the driving mechanism will lead to a complicated 
construction when use is made of a drum which is driven. According to the invention the guide plate having guide vanes is provided between 
the crushing rollers and the drum, by means of which the crop is 
deflected in a direction transversely to the direction of movement of 
the device, whilst, when seen in the direction of movement of the 
device the center of the drum is staggered with respect to the center  
 
of the crushing rollers in the same direction as wherein the crop is 
deflected by the guide plates. When the construction according to the invention is used a 
displacement of the crop between the crushing rollers and the drum in 
a direction transversely to the intended direction of movement of the 
device will be effected, whereby the drum may normally be rotatable 
about an axis of rotation

<CLAIMS>
A device for cutting crop, provided with a frame (2), with 
cutting means (3-5) supported by the frame, which are rotatable about 

upwardly extending axes of rotation, with co-acting crushing rollers 
(6, 7) arranged behind the cutting means (3-5), which are rotatable 

about at least substantially horizontal axes of rotation, with a 
drum (10), which is rotatable about an at least substantially 

horizontal axis of rotation, which is arranged behind the crushing 
rollers (6, 7), in the path of crop moving from the crushing rollers 

(6, 7) towards the rear during operation and with a guide plate (8), 
characterized in that the guide plate (8) having guide 

vanes (9) is provided between the crushing rollers (6, 7) and the 
drum (10), by means of which the crop is deflected in a direction 

transversely to the direction of movement (A) of the device and that, 
when seen in the direction of movement of the device the center of the 

drum (10) is staggered with respect to the center of the crushing 
rollers (6, 7) in the same direction as wherein the crop is deflected 

by the guide vanes (9). 
A device according to claim 1, characterized in that at 
least part of said guide vanes (9) include a different angle with the 

direction of movement (A), in such a manner that the crop leaving said 
crushing rollers (6, 7) is spread over a greater width. 
A device according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that 
guide plates (13), which extend along part of the circumference, at 

least substantially perpendicularly to the axis of rotation of the 
drum (10), are provided on the outer circumference of the drum (10) in 

reglarly spaced-apart relationship. 
A device according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that means are provided, by which the guide vanes (9) 

can be moved to and fro in a direction transversely to the direction 
of displacement of the crop during operation. 
A device according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that said drum (10) is arranged so as to be freely 

rotatable. 
A device according to any one of the preceding claims 1-4, 
characterized in that said drum (10) is driven at such a speed during  

 
operation, that the circumferential speed of the drum (10) is more or 

less equal to the speed of movement of the device during operation. 
A device according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that said drum (10) is driven at such a speed during 

operation, that the circumferential speed of the drum is about 2-3 
times as high as the speed of movement of the device during operation. 
A device according to claim 6 or 7, characterized in that 
said drum (10) is driven by means of a ground wheel (11) running on 

the ground during operation. 
A device according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that said drum (10) has a polygonal section.
