<ABSTRACT>
In the case of electric shock protection which is provided especially for panel distribution busbars (3) in low-voltage distribution cabinets, a flexible, electrically insulating covering profile (22, 22'), which essentially covers the contact bar of the side in each case, extends on both sides of the contact bar (14), along said bar. The covering profile (22, 22') is arranged in such a manner that it prevents the contact bar (14) being touched accidentially by a finger, but a terminal contact (9) which bears like a clasp against both sides of the contact bar (14) can, however, be pushed from the front onto the contact bar (14) with the two covering profiles (22, 22') being locally and automatically forced apart from one another. The force which is required to push the terminal contact (9) on can be reduced by means of a covering strip (21), which is additionally arranged on the front of the contact bar (14) and has a cross-section which tapers towards the front.

Protection against touching for busbars, in particular for 
district distribution bars (3) in low voltage distribution cabinets (100), 


with at least one contact rail (14, 34) forming part of a district 
distribution bar (3), held on an insulating support (11) and producing the 

electric contact to clip-on contacts (9) having two limbs (27, 27') of plug-in 
switching apparatus, 
there being provided a covering profile (22, 22'; 42, 42') which 
extends along the contact rail (14, 34), substantially covering over the 

contact rail (14, 34) laterally, the covering being electrically insulating 
and flexible and being pushed aside by one of the limbs (27, 27') when 

the contact (9) is slid into place, the forward region (25, 25;45,45') 
extending at least up to adjacent the leading edge of the contact rail (14, 

34), 
 
   
characterised in that
, 

the contact (9) has its two limbs (27, 27') gripping the two sides 
of the contact rail, (14, 34), 
that two covering profiles (22, 22') identical in cross-section and 
arranged symmetrically with respect to the central plane (M) of the 

contact rail (14, 34) have their bounding surfaces (23, 23') which form 
their rear termination secured to the insulating support (11) and are bent 

forwards in such a way that their forward side faces (14, 14') extend 

closely adjacent to the contact rail (14, 34) and approach one another, 
before the clamping contact (9) is inserted, in front of the leading edge of 

the contact rail (14, 34) in such a way that it is impossible to insert a 
finger sufficiently far to touch the contact rail (14, 34), whilst however, it 

is possible to introduce the limbs (27, 27') of the contact (9) into the gaps 
(26, 26') between the contact rail (14, 34) and the covering profiles (22,  

 
22'; 42, 42'), from the front, locally spreading apart the profiles (22, 22', 

42, 42'). 
Protection against touching according to claim 1, 

characterised in that
 an electrically insulating covering strip (21) is 
arranged on the contact rail (14), overlying its leading face (20) and 

extending along it. 
Protection against touching according to claim 2, 

characterised in that
 the contact rail (34) and/or the covering strip (21) 
have a cross-section which tapers towards the front symmetrically with 

respect to the central plane (M) of the contact rail (34, 14). 
Protection against touching according to claim 2 or 3, 

characterised in that
 the forward longitudinal edges of the contact rail 
(34) and/or of the covering strip (21) are rounded off. 
Protection against touching according to one of claims 2 to 
4, 
characterised in that
 the covering strip (21) has on its rear face an 
undercut section engaging a complementary section formed on the front 

face (20) of the contact rail (14) by interengagement or by sliding it in.  
 
Protection against touching according to one of claims 2 to 
5, 
characterised in that
 the covering strip (21) merges smoothly into the 
sides of the contact rail (14) without any step. 
Protection against touching to one of claims 2 to 6, 

characterised in that
 the covering strip (21) is made from heat-resistant 
plastics. 
Protection against touching according to claim 7, 

characterised in that
 the covering strip (21) is made from a glass-fibre-reinforced 
polyester. 
Protection against touching according to one of claims 1 to 
8, 
characterised in that
 the forward side faces (24, 24') of the covering 
profiles (22, 22') are flat and before insertion of the clamping contact (9) 

they extend parallel to the contact rail (14). 
Protection against touching according to one of claims 1 to 
9, 
characterised in that
 the covering profiles (22, 22'; 42, 42') each 
include an extension (32, 32') projecting in an inclined direction outwards 

and forwards from the central plane and forming the forward termination 
of the covering profile (22, 22'; 42, 42').  

 
Protection against touching according to one of claims 1 to 
100, 
characterised in that
 the covering profiles (22, 22') are angled back 
away from the bounding surfaces (13, 13') in two stages forwards against 

the contact rail (14). 
Protection against touching according to one of claims 1 to 
11, 
characterised in that
 the district distribution bar (3) is made as a 90° 
angle profile in cross-section, the one limb forming an attachment limb 

(13) serving for mounting the district distribution bar (3) by means of the 
insulating support (11) on a carrier (2) and simultaneously making contact 

with the main busbar (4), the other limb forming the contact rail (14) 
onto which the contact (9) of a switch installation (7) is slid. 
Protection against touching according to claim 12, 

characterised in that
 the thickness of the limbs of the angle-section 
profile amounts to about 10mm.
