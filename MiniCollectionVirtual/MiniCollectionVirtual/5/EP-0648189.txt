<ABSTRACT>
A set of parts (1) for providing a flow path connection between respective interiors of two members, such as a bag or reservoir (2a

 ) in a box (2b

 ) and a dosing apparatus (3), comprising a support part (4) for mounting on the box (2b

 ), and a piercing part (5) cooperable with the other dosing apparatus or member (3) and with the support part (4), the arrangement being such that when the two parts (2a

 , 2b

 ) and (3) are assembled piercing means such as a slant tip (6) of the piercing part (5) pierces the bag (2a

 ) of the one member (2a

 , 2b

 ) on relative movement of the two parts (4, 5).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a flow connection, particularly between respective 
interiors of two members which are connected, or to be connected, with a 
flow path between them. It is often necessary to connect two members, for example a drinks holder 
of the kind in which a flexible reservoir or bag of, say, liquid is held in a box, 
and the reservoir and box is to be connected to a dosing device for a 
measured distribution of the liquid from the reservoir in say a drinks 
machine. Such boxes with reservoirs therein are replaceable and it is accordingly 
essential that the contents of the reservoir remain sealed until the box is 
mounted in a drinks machine ready to be dispensed. Until now, it has not proved possible readily to provide a sealed container 
which is also easily prepared for dispensing of its contents when connected 
with a dispensing or dosing device. Similar considerations apply to dispensing 
of powders, particles or granules held initially in a sealed bag prior to 
dispensing from a machine in which the bag itself in a box, is mounted. It is accordingly an object of the invention to seek to mitigate this 
disadvantage. According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided a set of parts 
for providing a flow path connection between respective interiors of two 
members comprising a support part for mounting on one member, a piercing 
part cooperable with the other member and with the support part, 
characterised by shearable detent means of one part, the arrangement being 
such that when the two parts are assembled the detent means prevents  
 
undesired relative movement of the two parts until sufficient axial pressure 
is applied to the piercing part to shear the detent means and piercing means 
of the piercing part pierces the one member on relative movement of the two 
parts. The support part may have external engagement means releasably 
cooperable with engagement means of a mounting device of the one 
member. This provides a relatively simple construction. The respective engagement means may comprise snap-engageable means. 
This provides for ease of use and manufacture. The two parts may be interengageable by cooperable means whereby the 
piercing part may move telescopically with respect to the support part. This 
provides a positive action, particularly as the cooperable means may 
comprise screw thread means. The piercing means may comprise a tip of the piercing part. This provides 
a relatively simply integral piercing means. There may also be seal means whereby the
