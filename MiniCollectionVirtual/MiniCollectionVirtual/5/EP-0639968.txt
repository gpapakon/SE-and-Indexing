<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention are antiperspirant gel stick 
compositions to prevent perspiration and body odors having 
superior stability, low residue on the skin, low skin irritation, 
and excellent aesthetic characteristics. Furthermore, these 
compositions can be easily prepared by conventional techniques. Personal hygienic habits typically include a means for 
reducing of human body odors. These habits include routine 
bathing or washing the body, particularly the axilla, and treating 
said areas with a compositions to retard odor formation. Among 
such compositions are deodorants and antiperspirants. Deodorants are generally regarded as odor masking compositions 
which inhibit odors by retarding the growth of bacteria. Absent 
bacteria, the sweat produced by the body is not subjected to 
breakdown to odoriferous fatty acids. Antiperspirants also 
prevent formation of odoriferous fatty acids by retarding the 
growth of bacteria. However, unlike deodorants, antiperspirants 
prevent the formation of sweat which could be attacked by 
bacteria. Antiperspirants are well known in the art, and typically 
comprise an astringent material in a suitable carrier. Astringent 
materials typically used in antiperspirants are metal salts, 
particularly aluminum and zinc metal complexes. Said metal salts 
is disclosed in Plechner, Antiperspirants and Deodorants, 2 
Cosmetics, Science and Technology, Balsam and Sagarin, 374-400, 
1972. In addition to these above disclosure, Plechner also discloses 
that antiperspirants can take a number of different forms, each 
dependent on the ingredients used in addition to the above 
mentioned astringent metallic salts. The forms disclosed therein 
include liquids, solids, and semi-solids. Examples of these forms  
 
include lotions, solid sticks, and creams; the most popular being 
solid sticks. Antiperspirant sticks are well known in the art. For example 
antiperspirant sticks are disclosed in U.S Patent 2,890,987, 
Hilfer, issued June 16, 1959; and U.S. Patent 3,255,082, Barton et 
al, issued June 7, 1966. 
There are three main types of such stick formulations. These are 
compressed powder sticks, gel sticks , and wax sticks. While each 
may have advantages in certain use situations, each also has 
disadvantages. Antiperspirant compressed powder sticks mainly comprise 
powdery materials such as talc, powdered antiperspirant actives, 
and a binder which allows the stick to be formed using compressive 
forces. Although these sticks are generally stable, application 
to the skin is
