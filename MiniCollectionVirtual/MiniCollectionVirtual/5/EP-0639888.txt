<ABSTRACT>
A method of detecting and regulating load is provided 
for controlling a servomotor to prevent continuous 

overload on a machine, when a abnormal load is detected. 
When a load torque Td2 detected by an observer 

exceeds a reference value Ts (S6), a flag F1 is set to "1" 
(S7). In a next processing cycle, the flag F1 is "1" and a 

flag F2 is "0". Therefore, a position error A in an opposite 
direction to a driving direction is set to an error register Er 

(S10, S11), and the flag F2 is set to "1" (S12). In the subsequent 
processing cycles, a position error is obtained by 

subtracting a feedback quantity Sg(u) of a position from 
the error registrer Er (S13), and the position and a speed 

loop are processed by using this position error (S3, S4). A 
servomotor is reversed until the position error A becomes 

"0", and is then stopped.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of detecting an 
abnormal load acting on a servomotor which drives, for example, a 
cutter of a machine tool or a robot arm, and of 
controlling the servomotor when such abnormal load is 
detected. In a machine tool or a robot using a servomotor as a 
drive source, when a movable element of the machine tool 
such as a cutter or a table, or a robot arm collide with 
an obstacle, such a collision causes the servomotor to 
develop a large torque as it continues to drive the 
movable element of the machine tool or the robot arm in 
response to a given move command. Hence, the movable 
element of the machine tool or the robot arm is subjected 
to an abnormally large force which may damage the driving 
mechanism including the servomotor. To prevent such a 
damage, there is known a method including detecting an 
abnormal load acting on the servomotor, determining an 
occurrence of collision when an abnormal load is 
detected, and stopping the motor in such abnormal load 
condition. In the International Publication W091/10181, 
there is proposed a method of estimating a disturbance 
torque using a disturbance estimating observer, and 
detecting an abnormal load by comparing thus estimated 
disturbance torque with a predetermined set value. According to the above conventional method, when an 
abnormal load is detected, the speed command is set to  
 
"0", thereby stopping the servomotor immediately. However, when abnormal load is detected, the motor 
is already affected by the disturbance load. Since the 
machine has elastically deformable components, even 
when the motor has stopped immediately in response to 
the detection of the abormal load, the motor causes the 
machine to be kept depressed or the machine to be kept 
elastically deformed, thereby causing the machine to be 
continuously subjected to the load and the resulting 
damages to the tools and machine components. EP-A-0059541 discloses a protective system for 
automatic tool changing apparatus, which monitors the 
load current of a driving motor and, when the load 
current reaches an abnormally high current value during 
the operating period excluding the motor starting 
period, the operation of the automatic tool changing 
apparatus is reversed and then stopped. The object of the present invention is to improve 
control of a servomotor so that the motor is more 
advantageously not affected by the load when an 
abnormal load on the motor is detected, thereby 
preventing tools and machine components from being 
damage
