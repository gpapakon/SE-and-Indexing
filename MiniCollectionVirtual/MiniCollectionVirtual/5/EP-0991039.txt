<ABSTRACT>
A communications system for conveying visit information such as purchasing information to an
actual or potential visitor such as a customer (20) comprises transmitter means (16) for

transmitting to that visitor (20) information appropriate to the visitor's position within or with
respect to premises being visited, such as retail premises (10, MM). In a retail scenario,

portable communications apparatus (24) that moves with the customer (20), such as an
electronic wallet or a trolley-mounted terminal, receives the transmitted information and

conveys purchasing information to the customer (20). The transmitted information is preferably
tailored to the customer (20) but should any transmitted information be deemed inappropriate

to the customer (20), the communications apparatus (24) can filter that information to convey
only purchasing information of relevance.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to local messaging and has particular, but not exclusive, application to
messaging a potential customer with advertising material.It is well known in the realms of retailing that the probability of converting interest on the part
of a user who has seen an advertisement into an actual sale is improved when there is minimal
resistance presented to a purchaser. If the potential purchaser has to find a local store which
stocks the advertised item, travel to the store (with all the attendant delays) and then collect
the item, there is considerable resistance presented to the potential consumer. This widely
recognised problem has been addressed in the past by telephone sales and dedicated broadcast
channels which carry nothing but advertisements.However, certain items are not suitable for sale by this technique and certain consumers wish
to study a potential purchase before actually buying. For example, items of food are not really
suitable for sale by mail order because of a relatively short "shelf-life" which these items
typically possess. In addition, staple food items often have a high weight-to-value ratio
meaning that it is not economically viable to distribute them on a per-customer basis.
Furthermore, even those customers who are generally happy to order items without having
seen them will probably wish to buy items of clothing and footwear in person. Consequently,
there will continue to be a requirement for retail premises, whether local or in shopping malls,
which are visited by the consumer in person. The difficulty for suppliers of commodities is that a visitor to a shopping mall on a Saturday
may well have forgotten that he or she was interested in a pair of trainers that they saw
advertised on television on Wednesday evening.Prior approaches to this problem include posters and in-store announcements to customers.
However, posters are labour intensive and have to be designed, printed, delivered to the store
and then placed at the relevant points. All of this means that posters cannot respond quickly to
retailing initiatives and may not necessarily change between two consecutive visits made to the
store by a consumer. Consequently, they do not have the necessary impact effectively to
advertise special offers at short notice. In-store (public address) announcements have proved
equally unpopular with consumers.It is an object of the present invention to ameliorate the above disadvantages.From one aspect, the invention resides in a communications system for conveying visit
