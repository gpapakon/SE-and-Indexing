<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a process of making a compound of formula (I) where R1 contains an  alpha , beta -unsaturated carbonyl group and Rn is hydrogen or nonhydrogen radicals which do not have a functional group which interferes with the coupling reaction, which process comprises coupling a thiolphenol or phenylalkylmercaptan with a chloromethylpyridine in the presence of DBU under an inert atmosphere. These compounds are leukotriene antagonists and as such can be used in treating various diseases associated with leukotrienes.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Process for making phenylthiomethylpyridinyialkenoates.Scone of the Invention The field of this invention is that of a process for making certain thioethers by coupling a chloromethyl pyridyl compound with thiophenols and related mercaptans. The products of this coupling, the thioethers and their related sulfoxides and sulfones are useful for treating diseases arising from or related to leukotrienes, particularly leukotriene B4. As such there utility lies in antagonizing the affects of leukotrienes.Background of the Invention A series of thioethers represented by the general formulahave been discovered to be useful in treating diseases involving the leukotriene cascade, particularly those diseases believed to be associated with or caused by the dihydroxyleukotrienes Qeukotriene B4). These thioethers can be found in certain publications, particularly PCT application serial number PCT/US91/03772. A method for preparing those novel therapeutic agents is disclosed therein along with a description of - utility and the background of the family of bioactive lipids known as the leukotrienes.This invention relates to a process for making these compounds and other compounds of a similar nature where a chloromethylpridine is coupled with a thiophenol or benzylic mercaptan. Summary of the InventionThis invention covers a method for making a compound of formula Iwhere Rj contains an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl group and the designation (R)n indicates hydrogen or one or more non-hydrogen radicals capable of 

being covalently bonded on the pyridyl and phenyl rings and m is 0 -5; which method comprises coupling a chloromethylpyridine of formula II with a thiol of formula HI in the presence of l,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) under an inert gas at a temperature between about ambient and 100° C for a period sufficient to effect the coupling.Formula II Formula HI where Ri is defined above and (R)n is hydrogen or one or more radicals which can be substituted on either the pyridyl or phenyl ring and m is 0 - 5.General EmbodimentsThe following definitions are used in describing this invention.An α,β-unsaturated carbonyl group is illustrated by -CH=CH-C(=0)- or -CsC-C(=0)-. The imdefined carbonyl function valence can be a carbon- carbon bond, a carbon-heteroatom bond wherein the heteroatom is oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur or the like, including phosphorus. This invention is intended to cover all the enventualities where a thiol of the type illustrated is reacted with a pyridyl derivative which has an α,β-unsaturated
