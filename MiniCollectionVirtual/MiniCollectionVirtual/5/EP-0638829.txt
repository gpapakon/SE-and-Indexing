<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an opto-electronic
hybrid packaged platform capable of incorporating an
optical device or optical sub-module used for optical
communication and optical signal processing in addition to
optical waveguides and electrical wirings, an optical
sub-module which can be equipped on the board, and an opto-electronic
hybrid integrated circuit equipped with the
optical device or optical sub-module, and to a method for
producing the hybrid optical integration platform.With recent advance in optical communication and
optical information processing, development of an
opto-electronic integration circuit is in demand, in which
active devices are incorporated in low-loss optical
waveguides and the like to be driven by a high-frequency
electrical circuit.To achieve a circuit incorporated with active devices
on the optical waveguide and high-frequency driven, three
conditions are required for the optoelectronic board, which
are (1) a low-loss optical waveguide function, (2) an
optical bench function to incorporate an optical device on
the same substrate and prevent axis deviation, and (3) a
high-frequency 
electrical wiring function required to drive the
optical device.However, a circuit that satisfies the above three
conditions has not been obtained with the prior art.As a prior art example, Fig. 1 is a schematic
perspective view showing construction called "Silicon
optical bench" in which, using a guide groove 2 and
positioning reference surfaces 3a, 3b, and 3c formed
on a silicon substrate 1, an optical fiber 4 and a
semiconductor laser (LD) 5 are integrated on the
silicon substrate. In this construction, since the
guide groove can be formed with a good precision
utilizing good processability of the silicon
substrate, integration of the optical fiber 4 with
optical devices such as the semiconductor laser (LD) 5
and a photo-detector (PD) can be easily achieved.
Further, since the silicon substrate is superior in
thermal conductivity, it also functions as a good heat
sink for optical devices.Further, the electrical wiring 6 is formed
directly on the surface of the silicon substrate 1, or
through a very thin oxide film of less than 0.5µm in
thickness, but this structure has a problem of
considerably deteriorating the high-frequency
characteristics of the electrical wiring 6. That is,
to form the electrical wiring 6 with superior high-frequency
characteristics, the electrical wiring layer
must have a sufficient thickness and be formed on an
insulator with small dielectric loss. However,
