<DESCRIPTION>
The field of art to which this invention pertains is aromatic 
polyamide fibers and, more particularly, it is directed to a method of 
dyeing these fibers. Specifically, the instant invention is a method of dyeing a 
fiber structure of poly(p-phenylene terephthalamide (PPD-T) fibers or 
filaments with a water-soluble cationic dye. The fibers are dyed in a 
dye bath at a high pressure from about 29 to 108 psi at a temperature of 
from 130° to 180° C for a time sufficient to dye the fibers. Preferably 
such fibers are heated to a temperature in excess of,150° C, during the 
dyeing operation. These fibers, which are dried prior to being 
placed in the dye bath, can be dyed as tow or in the form of staple fibers 
or yarns or fabrics. By following the method of this invention, dried PPD-T fibers 
may be efficiently dyed a bright deep color with highly compatible water-soluble 
dyes without loss of dye effectiveness. Aromatic polyamide fibers are known to the art. They have outstanding 
properties such as high tensile strength, high modulus, flame and 
heat resistance, and good flex life which make them suited to be formed into 
fabrics usable as protective clothing, and for many other uses. More specifically, this invention is directed to a method of 
dyeing aromatic polyamide fibers of a poly(p-phenylene terephthalamide) 
polymer, hereinafter referred to as PPD-T fibers. Such fibers which are 
described in greater detail in US-A-3,767,756 to Blades; 
US-A-3,869,429, also to Blades and US-A-4,144,023 to Provost, for example, possess 
many useful properties, as indicated above. It is well-known that aromatic polyamide fibers and particularly 
PPD-T fibers are difficult to dye. As a result, various methods 
have evolved, over the years, for dyeing poly(p-phenylene terephthalamide, 
(PPD-T) fibers in various forms.  
 The most generally accepted method of dyeing PPD-T fibers 
has been to dye the fibers, after they have been crimped, in a pressure 
vessel at 121° to 132° C temperatures, using an aqueous dyebath containing 
a large percentage of a carrier, such as acetophenone. This method has 
proven to be effective for dyeing dried PPD-T fibers with water-soluble 
dyes. However, the large amount of carrier involved can present certain 
cost and dyebath disposal problems to the user. Further, several hours 
are generally required to achieve the depth of color desired in the 
finished product. Also, this method is more suitable for dyeing fabric 
or staple fibers. Another method suitable for dyeing crimped PPD-T

<CLAIMS>
A method of dyeing poly(p-phenylene terephthalamide) fibers 
including the steps of: 


placing the dry and crimped fibers in an aqueous bath containing a cationic, basic water-soluble dye, 
heating the fibers under a pressure of 200 to 745 kPa (29 to 108 p.s.i) and 
a temperature of 130° to 180°C for a time sufficient to dye the fibers. 
The method of claim 1 wherein the fibers are crimped to 
between 2.8 to 5.9 crimps per cm (7 to 15 crimps per inch). 
The method of claim 1 wherein the fibers are crimped to 
about 3.9 crimps per cm (10 crimps per inch). 
The method of claim 1 wherein the fibers are dyed 
without use of a carrier. 
The method of claim 1 wherein the fibers are heated to a 
temperature of 150° to 180°C for a time sufficient to dye the fibers.
