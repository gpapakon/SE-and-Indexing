<ABSTRACT>
Two embodiments are described of a device for the remote 
actuation of electric switches, particularly power 

switches and switches to be mounted on "OMEGA" guides, 
each including an actuator (4,8,9;33,34,35) of the 

recirculating-ball lead-screw type, which drives a slider 
(11) or a lever (41) which engages the operating lever 

(2;42) of the switch. 
Operation of the actuator (4,8,9;33,34,35) causes the 
slider (11) or the lever (41) to move in one direction or 

the other thereby switching the switch. 
One embodiment provides means (20,23) for enabling the 
device to be operated manually.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for the remote 
actuation of an electric switch, with an electric motor 
and transmission means for driving a member coupled to 
the opening and closing mechanism of the switch. As is known, in electrical installations, mains switches, 
and power switches in particular, are arranged in places 
which are not easily accessible such as cabinets, wall 
cupboards and the like. This arrangement involves 
considerable problems when the switches need to be 
actuated and has given rise to a need for devices able to 
carry out the operation at a distance. Prior-art remote-actuation devices generally include 
electric or electromagnetic motors which act on the lever 
of the switch through a complex series of levers to move 
it from its open to its closed position or vice versa. However, these prior art devices have the disadvantage of 
being very heavy and bulky as well as being expensive to 
produce which makes them uneconomical in many cases. In addition, in many applications, for example when an 
emergency power supply must be switched on when the 
switch is opened, the switches must have very fast 
switching times which means that very powerful and thus  
 
very large actuating devices must be used. For these reasons, a need has been felt in the industry 
for devices that are able to actuate a switch from a 
distance but which, unlike known devices, are compact, 
light and inexpensive while ensuring fast switching 
times. In addition, any such device should preferably be 
simply designed, making it both quick to assemble and 
economical to service. These requirements are satisfied, according to the 
invention, by an actuating device characterised in that 
the transmission means include a recirculating-ball lead 
screw arrangement as the coupling means. The invention will now be described in detail, purely by 
way of non-limitative example, with reference to the 
appended drawings, in which: 
Figure 1 is a perspective view showing a first 
embodiment of the device of the invention applied to a 
switch; Figure 2 is a vertical section of the device of 
Figure 1; Figure 3 is a vertical section in a plane 
perpendicular to that of Figure 2; and Figures 4 and 5 are sectioned views of a second 
embodiment of the device of the invention in two 
different working positions. With reference to Figures 1 to 3, a power switch is 
indicated 1, its operating lever is indicated 2, the 
support structure of the remote actuation device applied 
to the switch is indicated 3 and a cover

transmission means for driving an actuating member 
(11;41) able to be coupled to a mechanism for opening and 

closing the contacts of the switch, characterised in that 
the transmission means include a recirculating-ball lead-screw 

arrangement (8,9;34,35) as the coupling means. 
A device according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
it includes a support structure (3) and means for fixing 

this structure to the wall of the switch from which an 
operating lever (2) projects, in that the screw (8) of

member includes a slider (11) which is fixed for 
translational movement with the nut (9) is movable along 

a pair of parallel guides (12) and includes means (13,14) 
for engaging the operating lever (2) of the switch to 

open it or close it when the slider (11) moves in one 
direction or the other. 
A device according to Claim 2, characterised in that 

the means which engage the operating lever (2) include a 
slot (13) which houses two idle pins (14) which engage 

the operating lever of the switch.

support structure (3) with the interposition of thrust 
bearings (5,10).

Claims 2 to 5, characterised in that it includes a first 

bevel gear (20) fixed to the screw (8), a second bevel 
gear (21) which meshes with the first and is mounted on 

the support structure (3), and actuating means (23),
