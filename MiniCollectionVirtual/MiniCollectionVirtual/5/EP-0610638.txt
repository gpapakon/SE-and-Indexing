<ABSTRACT>
An ecologically friendly, non-invasive incontinence aid assembly 
to be worn by a person suffering from incontinence. The assembly 

comprises a urine collector unit (11), a urine storage container (23), 
a flushing liquid 

container (19), pumps for the urine (12) and the flushing fluid (20) 
and an air pump (16) for 

sweeping the urine collector unit with air. In operation urine is 
temporarily 

collected in the urine collector from which it is pumped into the urine 
storage container. The urine collector unit is washed with the flushing 

liquid 
and dried by air sweeping. The assembly is suitable for use over an 

extended period of time without any need for servicing and is not 
accompanied 

by unpleasant odors and may be anatomatically fitted for use by either 
males or females.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns an incontinence aid assembly. Incontinence is a problem affecting a significant part of the world 
population, generally estimated to be from 10 to 13%, the affected 
population including elderly persons, pregnant women, persons suffering 
from degenerative diseases and others. At the present time, the problem is 
generally handled by the use of catheters or diapers. Catheters which are 
introduced through the urethra into the bladder are very uncomfortable and 
may cause irritation and/or infection. Diapers are uncomfortable, expensive, 
require frequent changing and may cause dermatitis, decubitus ulcers, etc. 
In addition, the non-expendable nature of most diapers adds to the ever 
increasing ecological problem resulting from non-expendable waste. It is the object of the present invention to provide a novel, non-invasive 
and ecologically friendly assembly for use by incontinent persons 
which can be worn for an extended period of time without the need for any 
servicing.  According to the present invention there is provided an incontinence 
aid assembly to be worn by a person suffering from incontinence 
underneath the clothing, comprising a collector unit for intercepting and 
temporarily collecting the wearer's urine, urine storage means for the 
accumulation of intercepted urine, and pumping means for withdrawing 
urine from said collector means into said liquid storage means. The urine storage means are preferably so designed that in use 
there always remains an air space above the body of urine therein. Optionally the assembly according to the invention further 
includes a flushing liquid container holding a body of flushing liquid, and 
means for intermittently flushing the said collector unit with flushing liquid 
in order to remove urine residues and maintain the desired hygienic 
conditions of said collector. The flushing liquid may be water or a 
physiological solution and may also include a suitably dosed amount of a 
drug, e.g. an antiseptic. If desired, the assembly according to the invention may comprise 
means for withdrawing urine vapors from said urine collector unit and 
injecting them into said body of flushing liquid. Where the said urine 
storage means are so designed that in use an air space always remains above 
the body of urine therein, the assembly may further include means for 
withdrawing vapor from said air space and injecting it into said body of 
flushing liquid. In this way the development of an unpleasant urine smell 
is suppressed. The

generating sensor means (28, 29, 30) associated with said urine collector 
means (11) being linked to said processor means, whereby the pumps (12, 

16, 20) are activated in response to conditions inside the urine collector 
means (11). 
An assembly according to any one of Claims 2 to 7, wherein said 
pumping means for withdrawing urine from said collector means (12) are 

capable of operating in two modes, a first mode in which urine is withdrawn 
from the collector means and a second mode in which flushing liquid is 

injected into the collector means (11). 
An assembly according to any one of Claims 2 to 7, comprising 
a dedicated flushing pump. 
An assembly according to any one of Claims 4 to 7, wherein said 
flushing liquid storage container (19) has a pressure sensitive flushing valve 

capable of yielding to a predetermined pressure building up inside the 
container by said vapors, whereby an amount of flushing liquid is discharged 

from the container.
