<ABSTRACT>
A method for the control of pitch in a pulp is characterised in that the method comprises sequentially adding to and mixing with the pulp (1) 1-10 Kg/tonne of pulp of a low molecular weight, high cationic charge, polymeric, water-soluble species, such as those derived from inorganic aluminium salts or quaternary polyamines, and (2) 0.5 to less than 10 Kg/tonne of pulp of montmorillonite clay particles, such as bentonite, which clay particles may be chemically modified to improve adsorption capacity or otherwise treated to increase the anionic charge density of the dispersion but which do not have a water-soluble cationic polymer associated therewith.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Method for controlling pitch ~% This invention concerns a method of controlling tch in pulps for use in making paper. fø More particularly, this invention concerns a method o controlling the buildup of pitch on equipment used for pulping and the improved dispersion of pitch in pulps.Pitch, carried over from wood or bark pulped to make papermaking furnishes, is formed of a complex mixture of oleophilic, water insoluble, low molecular weight, essentially non-polar resins comprising fatty and resin acids with ionisable hydrophillic groups, fatty and resin acid esters, sterols, di and tri-glycerides, terpenes and waxes and various alcohols, hydrocarbons and neutral compounds associated with these resins. The resins tend to agglomerate to form sticky films or pitch balls, which in turn can give rise to spotting in the final paper product, wire spots, localised sticky spots on rolls, holes in the paper sheet, poor paper formation, felt plugging or sticking on dryer and calender rolls.Effective pitch control, particularly in paper mills which produce paper from groundwood, thermo- mechanical and semi-chemical pulps, has traditionally been difficult. The important parameters for pitch control are elegantly summarised in US-A-4964955 as follows:"To control pitch effectively it is not necessary to remove all of the pitch from the pulp. Different types of pulp mills have different tolerance levels for pitch particles which must be exceeded before pitch caused problems occur. WhatSUBSTITUTE SHEET 

 is necessary, however, is that the pitch be dispersed as tiny non-harmful aggregated or agglomerated particles and retained in this fine particulateform rather than as larger harmful globs in the paper sheet. Simply flocculating pitch will not give good pitch control; the pitch must be made to attach to either the cellulosic fibres or to any particulate matter used as filler in the paper sheet, or preferably to both. Pitch retained in large floes causes breaks and undesirable dark specks in the finished paper sheet, while pitch not retained but in small floes tends to accumulate in the papermaking facility's white water system".Efforts to control pitch deposit problems by dispersing or precipitating the pitch have traditionally involved the use of alum salts; ultrafine crystalline talc; anionic, cationic and non-ionic dispersants, polymeric retention aids and mixtures of these materials. More recently, water soluble zirconium salt complexes and organotitaniu chemicals have been suggested as pitch control
