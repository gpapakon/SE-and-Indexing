<ABSTRACT>
Method for converting reactive gases which are sucked in at a low inlet pressure and are expelled at a higher outlet pressure by a dry multi-stage pump, in which method the reactive gases are physically and/or chemically converted into nonreactive components at a pressure situated between the inlet and outlet pressure, the conversion taking place, according to the invention, by means of gas discharge. The invention also relates to a dry multi-stage vacuum pump (3) and a plasma scrubber (4) which are particularly suitable for use in the method according to the invention.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an apparatus comprising a dry
vacuum pump and a plasma scrubber, being suitable for
use in a method for converting reactive gases which are
sucked in at a low inlet pressure and expelled at a
higher outlet pressure by a dry multi-stage pump, in
which method the reactive gases are physically and/or
chemically converted into non-reactive components at a
pressure situated between the inlet and outlet pressure.Such a method is disclosed in the European Patent
Application No. 0 448 750 and is used, in particular, in the
production of, for example, chips, LC screens and the like,
or in the application of coatings to products of all kinds.
In this case, a starting material is treated in a reactor
with the aid of chemical or physical processes or a
combination of such processes. Generally, a low to very low
pressure (approximately 10-1-1000 Pa) prevails in the reactor
and gases which are, for example, deposited on the starting
material or are used in some other way by the treatment
processes are supplied for the treatment of the surface of
the starting material. For a number of reasons, such as, for
example, to obtain a uniform distribution of the substances
to be deposited on the surface of a wafer and to increase the
production rate, such gases are supplied in excess.
Generally, only approximately 15% of the gas supplied is used
in the reactor, whereas the remainder and the gaseous
reaction products are expelled again. The remaining gas or
effluent is expelled into the atmosphere via a pipe, a vacuum
pump, preferably only one multi-stage pump, and an expelling
pipe system. The gases or gas mixtures used in the reactor,
such as silane and ammonia, tetraethoxysilane, tungsten
hexafluoride and hydrogen, dichlorosilane and ammonia,
titanium chloride and dichlorosilane, and tetradimethylaminotitanium
and ammonia are generally toxic, corrosive and
flammable. The gaseous reaction products usually contain
solids which may damage the vacuum pump and may block the
expelling pipe system, 
which may result in explosions.Solid dust particles are liberated in the treatment
processes in the reactor and may be produced by the
gases reacting in the pipe from the reactor to the pump
and in the pump itself under the influence of the
temperature prevailing therein, solid particles being
released. In the case of silane, for example, glassy
solid particles are produced by oxidation.Because the pressure of the gases sucked in by
the dry multi-stage pump is very low and the flow rate is
high, only a few
