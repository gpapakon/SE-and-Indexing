<ABSTRACT>
An optical disk recording device for forming a pit 
on an optical disk (10) by projecting recording laser 

beam of an amount corresponding to a pit length of the 
pit to be formed includes a recording speed increase 

ratio setting section (28) for setting a recording speed 
increase ratio, a rotation control section (16) for 

rotating the optical disk at the set recording speed 
increase ratio, and a laser power control section (25) 

for controlling laser power of the recording laser beam 
in a pit period and laser power of the recording laser 

beam in a bottom period in such a manner that both the 
laser power in the pit period and the laser power in the 

bottom period will be increased as the set recording 
speed increase ratio is increased. When recording is 

made at a higher recording speed, not only the pit power 
but also the bottom power of the recording laser beam is 

increased and, accordingly, difference between the pit 
power and the bottom power is reduced as compared with a 

case where the pit power only is increased. Therefore, 
an adequate time is made available for detection of a 

tracking error, so that deterioration of the signal-to-noise 
ratio of a wobble signal can be prevented.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an optical disk recording
device of a type which records information by
projecting laser beam on a recording surface of an
optical disk to form pits thereon and, more
particularly, to an optical disk recording device of
this type capable of preventing occurrence of an adverse
effect to signal-to-noise ratio of a wobble signal when
recording is made by using a higher recording speed than
a normal recording speed.As a manner of recording information on a write-once
type optical disk on the basis of the CD-WO (CD
Write Once) standard, it has been proposed to record
information by using not only a normal speed but also a
higher speed than the normal speed such as a double
speed and a quadruple speed. By using such high speed
recording, for example a quadruple speed, it is possible
to store data such as CD-ROM data and audio data in a
hard disk, read the stored data in the form of quadruple
compressed data, and record the read out data by driving
an optical disk at a quadruple speed. In case a double
speed is employed, for example, a Compact Disc player
may be driven at a double speed and an optical disk may
be driven at a double speed also to copy reproduced 
data.In a prior art optical disk recording device, it
has been proposed to perform a high speed recording by
increasing power (pit power) of recording laser beam in
a pit forming section (i.e., pit period) as shown in
Fig. 2 for accurately forming pits on the optical disk.According to the CD-WO standard, a groove called
"pregroove" is preformed on the recording surface of an
optical disk and, during recording of information,
recording is made by tracking this pregroove under a
tracking control. This pregroove is not a straight line
but is undulated with a particular frequency and this
undulation is called "wobble". In the recording mode,
this wobble is detected on the basis of a residual
component of a tracking error signal and a CLV (constant
linear velocity) spindle control is realized by PLL-controlling
a disk motor so that the frequency of the
detected wobble will become a predetermined frequency
(e.g., 22.05 kHz in a normal recording speed mode).If the device is designed in a manner to detect a
tracking error constantly, a DC offset component of a
tracking error signal will increase and a signal-to-noise
ratio will be deteriorated due to influence caused
by a signal at a pit position and this will cause an
adverse effect on the tracking control and the spindle
control based on the wobble signal and will also make it 
diffi
