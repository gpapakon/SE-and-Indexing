<ABSTRACT>
Both guide grooves and lands of an optical information 
recording medium constitute information tracks, the depth 

of the guide groove being between approximately λ/8 and 
approximately λ/4.7 in optical length and the width of the 

guide groove being between 0.34R and R, where R represents the 
beam diameter of a write laser beam on the record film and the 

power for writing information on each guide groove being 
differentiated from that for writing information on each land.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an optical information write/read system in which information
data is written on a recording medium by a write laser beam, and written
information data is read from the recording medium by a read laser beam. The invention particularly relates to an optical information
read/write device in use for recording information signals on
an optical information recording medium having improved
information density, where information is written on guide
grooves as well as regions between two guide grooves adjacent
with each other, all guide grooves of the optical recording
medium being formed before writing information.In recent years there have been extensive research
and development on optical information recording media to
achieve high density recording of such information as image
and voice signals. One of the well-known examples is an
optical disk. A writable optical disk has guide grooves
formed in advance by cutting on a transparent substrate.
Information signals are read or written by focusing a laser
beam onto these tracks. When a commercially available optical
disk is used for writing information signals, signals are
normally written on either guide grooves or regions between
two guide grooves adjacent with each other (hereinafter
referred to as the land), but not on both. When writing information signals, a laser beam from
an optical head is focused by an object lens onto a recording
layer in a guide groove. When the intensity of the laser beam
is strong, the region the laser beam is focused on undergoes
a change in reflectance, and a record mark is formed. The
distance between record marks on adjacent guide grooves is the
width of the land between them.When reading information signals, record marks
arranged along a guide groove are irradiated by a focused
laser beam, which is either reflected or absorbed, thus the
intensity of the reflected laser beam varies. Reading of
information signals is performed by an optical head detecting
the variation of the intensity of the reflected light. The
track pitch, that is, the spatial period of guide grooves is
about the size of the laser beam spot and set to be 1.6 µm in
this explanation. The depth of the guide groove is about one
eighth of the wavelength of the read beam in optical length.
This depth gives rise to the maximum push-pull signals of
reflected light from an optical disk having guide grooves,
thus provides the most stable push-pull tracking control.In order to increase memory capacity of an optical
disk it would be natural to
