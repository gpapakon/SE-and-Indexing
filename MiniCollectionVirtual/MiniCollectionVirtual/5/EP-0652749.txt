 METHODS AND COMPOSITIONS FOR INHIBITING 5α-REDUCTASE ACTIVITYBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Cross-Referenced and Related ApplicationThis application is a continuation-in-part application of U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 07/889,589 filed May 27, 1992, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.1. Field Of The InventionThe present invention relates generally to compounds, compositions and methods regulating the actions of androgens and other steroid hormones by modulating the activity of 5r_-reductase. More particularly, the present invention relates to the use of these compounds to treat disorders that are caused by excess androgen action in cells or organs.2. Description Of The Related ArtA. Steroid Hormones and Their ReceptorsAndrogens are one of the six major classes of steroid hormones. Steroid hormones form complexes with specific receptor proteins in selective cells of target organs [Jensen et al., Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci.(USA), 59:632 (1968); Liao, Intl. Rev. Cytology 41:87 (1975); Gorski, et al., Ann. Rev. Physiol. 42: 17 (1976)]. Steroid receptors are members of a superfamily of transcription factors that can regulate gene expression, and this function is dependent on the binding of a specific hormonal ligand to an appropriate receptor [Evans, Science 240:889 (1989); Beato, Cell 56:335 (1989); O'Malley, Mol. Endocrinol. 4:363 (1990)].Studies of the specificity and affinity of steroid hormones for their receptors have contributed greatly to the understanding of the relationships among steroid and receptor structures and biological activity, target organ specificity, and the mechanism of action of many antihormones, including "competitive antiandrogens". "Competitive Antiandrogens" are defined herein as those antiandrogens that interact with receptors and competitively prevent receptor binding of active androgens [Fang and Liao, Mol. Pharmacol. 5:428 (1969); Liao et al., J. Biol. Chem. 248:6154 (1973); Liao et al., Endocrinology 94: 1205 (1974); Chang and Liao, J. Steroid Biochem. 27: 123 (1987); Liao et al., J. Steroid Biochem. 34:41 (1989)], although it 

should be noted that some compounds with an antiandrogenic activity may act by a different mechanism.B. Androgen ActionsAndrogen, produced in the testis, stimulates the differentiation of the male reproductive organs, including the penis, scrotum, prostate, seminal vesicles, epididymis, and vas deferens. With the onset of puberty, an increase in the production of androgen promotes the growth of these tissues. Androgen is
