<ABSTRACT>
The proposal is for a casting set for a pressure die casting machine which comprises a casting chamber (2) with a casting plunger (3) guided therein. In order to supply the outer circumferential surface of the casting plunger (3) with lubricant, the casting chamber (2) has an annular encircling lubricant channel (10) which is supplied via a feed line (11) with lubricant which, after flowing through the lubricant channel, enters a drain line (17) for the lubricant.

Casting set for a pressure die casting machine comprising a casting chamber, a 
casting piston guided in the casting chamber with a piston rod which can be 

activated by a casting drive, in which for lubricating the casting piston at least one 
lubricant supply line is provided to the piston sleeve surface with which a 

peripheral annular groove-shaped lubricant channel in the casting chamber 
connects, characterised in that the annular-groove-shaped lubricant channel (10) 

is provided with an inlet (11) and an outlet (17) for the lubricant, and in that the 
lubricant can be supplied metered under pressure to the lubricant channel (10) so 

that the casting piston outer sleeve surface (5) is coated as far as possible with 
lubricant. 
Casting set according to claim 1, characterised in that the lubricant channel (10) 
is positioned in the end region of the casting chamber (2) facing away from the die 

and is designed as a peripheral annular channel rectangular in cross section on 
the inner wall of the casting chamber interior (8). 
Casting set according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the supply channel 
(13) of the lubricant to the annular lubricant channel (10) enters tangentially into 

the latter and in that the lubricant is pressed through the annular channel (10) as 
far as possible so that the casting piston outer sleeve surface (5) is coated all 

around with lubricant. 
Casting set according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the 

lubricant channel (10) has a blocking nose (20) which extends up to the casting 
piston surface (5) and borders a lubricant outlet (15). 
Casting set according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the 
lubricant outlet (15) with the outlet region of the lubricant channel (10) (arrow 21) 

forms an acute angle Î±.  
 
Casting set according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that a 
lubricant metering pump (22) is connected directly to the supply line (11) for the 

lubricant. 
Casting set according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that a 
metering pump (22) for lubricant and a compressed air line (26) with an on-off 

valve (25) is assigned to the lubricant supply line (11). 
Casting set according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that to the 
lubricant supply line (11) is assigned a pressure container (28) for a lubricant 

mixture of air and lubricant, which can be supplied via a preferably time-controlled 
on-off valve (25). 
Casting set according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that a 
check valve (31) with counter pressure spring (32) can be integrated into the 

lubricant supply line (11), whereby the check valve (31) remains closed with 
connected vacuum of the vacuum pressure die casting machine. 
Casting set according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the 
lubricant outlet line (17) has a controllable restrictor (18). 
Casting set according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the 
lubricant outlet line (17) enters into a lubricant collecting tank (19). 
Casting set according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that a 
vacuum container (34) for vacuum loading the casting piston (3) can be 

connected to the lubricant outlet line (17) via a multiway valve (33).  
 
Casting set according to one of the preceding claims characterised in that the 
casting chamber interior (8) can be filled with molten metal via an upper filler 

opening (9) or via a lower suction line (29). 
Casting set according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the 
casting piston (3) after wetting with lubricant and mould release agent performs an 

idle stroke in the casting chamber for casting chamber lubrication. 
Casting chamber according to claim 14, characterised in that after lubrication of 
the casting chamber the lubricant channel (10) including the associated inlet and 

outlet lines is subjected to an additional compressed air loading.
