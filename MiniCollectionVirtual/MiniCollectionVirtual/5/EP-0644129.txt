<ABSTRACT>
Container particularly for multicomponent products, 
including a first tank (1) and a second tank (2) each 

having, on a respective outer wall (3), a median portion 
(4) which rises from said wall. The median portion (4) is 

provided with seats (5, 6) for accommodating engagement 
pins (18, 19) which rise from a coupling partition (7) 

provided with a frame (8) shaped complementarily with 
respect to each outer wall (3) of the tanks (1, 2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a container
particularly for multicomponent products.Particular products which comprise at least two active
components which can be used for their aesthetic effects
when mixed in appropriate doses are used in cosmetology.
The problem which arises is indeed linked to the active
components, which in some cases lose their effectiveness if
they are placed in contact with other active components or
are severely limited in terms of the persistence of their
activity.Furthermore, in many other fields of application there
is the need to keep chemically incompatible liquids or
emulsions separate until they are dispensed.In order to solve this problem, multicomponent
containers have been used; said containers have at least
one pair of containers which allow to mix the components of
the cosmetic product just before or during their
application.These containers usually comprise a pair of
containers, in the case of two components, which are kept
close together by means of an external retention cup within
which they are inserted with one of their ends, whereas
their dispenser is a dispensing actuation closure which
allows to mix the active components before or during their
dispensing.However, this solution leads to considerable problems,
since the connection of the two containers is not stable.
It should be furthermore stressed that the outer cup, which
may also be metallic, reduces the printable surface of the 
containers, to the detriment of the information which must
be printed thereon according to the applicable statutory
provisions.From the document FR-A-2 647 093 it is known a
container as defined in the preable of appended claim 1.An aim of the present invention is to eliminate or
substantially reduce the problems described above by
providing a container particularly for multicomponent
products which eliminates the use of external cups for the
containment and mutual coupling of the containers.Another object of the present invention is to provide a
container which allows to obtain a stable coupling between
the two containers of the individual products.Not least object of the present invention is to provide
a container which is highly reliable, relatively easy to
manufacture and at competitive costs.This aim, the objects mentioned and others which will
become apparent hereinafter are achieved by a container
particularly for multicomponent products as defined in the
characterizing portion of claim 1.Further characteristics and advantages of the present
invention will become apparent

<CLAIMS>
A container, particularly for multicomponent
products, comprising a first tank (1) and a second tank (2)

each having, on a respective outer wall, seats (5, 6) for
accommodating engagement means (18, 19), characterized in

that said seats are defined in a median portion (4) which
rises from said outer wall, and in that said engagement means (18,

19) rise from a coupling partition (7) of the container, said partition having
a frame (8) which is shaped complementary with respect to

each outer wall (3) of said tanks (1, 2).
A container according to claim 1, characterized in
that each accommodation seat (5, 6) has, in said median

portion (4), a blind cavity which has an undercut (5a, 6a)
against which said engagement means (18, 19) engage.
A container according to claim 1, characterized in
that each one of said engagement means comprises a pin (18,

19) protruding from said partition (7), each pin having its
head split transversely so as to engage said undercut (5a,

6a).
