Knock control on a spark-ignition internal combustion 
engine, 


with short-time control involving the use of a map 
permanently stored in dependence on operating 

parameters to pre-specify a map (α
V
) for the ignition 
point for a respective given map range of the 

internal combustion engine, 
if knocking episodes (K) occur, this pre-specified 
map (α
V
) is modified in the "retard" direction by one 
respective increment using a "retard" correction 

factor (SK) on a control stroke (R
h
), to a value for 
a current ignition point, and 
in the absence of knocking episodes (K), the value 
for the current ignition point is moved back in the 

"advance" direction towards the pre-specified map, by 
one respective increment using an "advance" 

correction factor (FK) on a control stroke (R
h
), 
 
characterised in that 


additional long-time adaptation is performed in a 
manner whereby 
whenever knocking episodes occur, the pre-specified 
map (α
V
) is moved back away from the knock limit, or 
modified, by an adaptation value (L
ZW
 or L
ZK
 
respectively), with the result that the short-time 

control is based on a new, long-time-corrected, pre-specified 
ignition point (the pre-specified map plus 

the adaptation value) or another level (α
LZW
 or α
LZK
 
respectively),  

 
within given, repeated observation time intervals 
(t
B
) in each case the adaptation values (L
ZW
) are 
established in dependence on the knocking episodes 

(K) encountered and are learned in a learning 
process, 
a learned, new adaptation value (L
ZW
) is established 
for a given map range which has just been negotiated, 

is logged and stored in an associated correction map 
upon leaving this map range, and this adaptation 

value (L
ZW
) is output as a learned corrective 
variable when the same map range is re-entered and is 

made available again for a correction to the pre-specified 
map, 
the adaptation values (L
ZW
) stored in the map also 
remain stored when the internal combustion engine is 

switched off and continue to be available when the 
engine is started up again, 
the adaptation values (L
ZW
) are only established, or 
changes made to stored adaptation values (L
ZW
), when 
the internal combustion engine has warmed up, in 

other words above a given temperature threshold value 
(TS) of preferably the cooling water temperature, 
when the internal combustion engine is cold, or 
rather below the given temperature threshold value 

(TS), the adaptation values (L
ZW
) established while 
the internal combustion engine was warm are evaluated 

and in each case made available with a smaller value 
than the reduced adaptation value (L
ZK
) for the long-time 
correction procedure. 
Knock control according to claim 1, characterised in 
that evaluation of the adaptation values (L
ZW
) when 
the internal combustion engine is cold involves  

 
logging evaluation factors (BG) as percentages below 

100% in a characteristic curve over the engine 
temperature (T) up to the temperature threshold value 

(TS), preferably in approx. 16 ranges, and using the 
said evaluation factors (BG) to reduce the 

corresponding adaptation values (L
ZW
), with the full 
adaptation values (L
ZW
) being made available above 
the temperature threshold value (TS). 
Knock control according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the adaptation value (L
ZW
) used 
is a current control stroke (R
h
) prior to leaving the 
map range. 
Knock control according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the adaptation value (L
ZW
) is 
obtained by averaging the respective control strokes 

(R
h
) present at the time of a knocking episode over 
an observation time interval (t
B
) or the delay period 
in the given map range. 
Knock control according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the adaptation value (L
ZW
) is 
obtained by averaging all the control strokes (R
h
) 
present in an observation time interval (t
B
) or the 
delay period in the given map range. 
Knock control according to any of claims 1 to 5 
characterised in that in the absence or near absence 

of knocking episodes (K) within at least one 
observation time interval (t
B
) or the delay period in 
the given map range the adaptation value (L
ZW
) is 
withdrawn, in each case stepwise by a given restore 

variable (Δ L
K
), in the direction of the original 
pre-specified map (α
V
).  
 
Knock control according to any of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that there is provision for 

cylinder-selective knock control for each cylinder of 
the internal combustion engine. 
Knock control according to any of claims 1 to 7, 

characterised in that an initialisation map is 
provided for the first occasion when the engine is 

started up.
