<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a vehicle-mounted device 
for identifying and signalling the presence of 

danger and/or hazardous situations, as well as for 
passing on such a signal to other vehicles.It 

comprises a first component (1) to register the 
presence of a change in speed or direction of a 

vehicle which is greater than a threshold 
discrimination value, whereupon an electrical 

circuit (5) is broken; a second component (2), 
which emits a first electromagnetic wave when the 

device is functioning normally, and a second 
electromagnetic wave when the electrical circuit 

(5) is broken, and a third electromagnetic wave 
when it is so commanded by a manual switch; and a 

third component (3) which on receiving and 
recognising the first electromagnetic wave 

activates a normal function signal, on receiving 
the second wave emits a danger signal, and on 

receiving the third wave emits a hazard signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a vehicle-mounted device 
for identifying and signalling the presence of 
danger and/or hazardous situations, as well as for 
passing on such a signal to other vehicles. The device belongs to the field of safety devices 
for motor vehicles, all aimed at improving road 
safety conditions, and especially to the field of 
aids which extend the limits of normal human 
perception, so that potentially dangerous 
situations can be identified as soon as possible 
while driving, obviously with the aim of allowing 
a driver to take suitable action. The prior art teaches devices of the above type, 
in particular two devices. In the first of these, 
a device placed in the front of the vehicle sends 
out continuous radar signals. The echo signals 
received back from objects ahead of the vehicle 
are analysed in terms of speed, and if this should 
suddenly drop below a predetermined threshold  
 
speed, an alarm signal is set off. The principal disadvantage of this device is that 
its field of action is limited to a zone straight 
in front of the vehicle. When the vehicle turns 
round a bend, a delicate moment indeed, when a 
driver is less well sighted than on a straight, 
the device is not only unable to sense the 
presence of an obstacle, but is liable to give 
false readings, as it reports objects situated on 
the other side of the road (or even off the road 
completely) and not at all in the trajectory of 
the vehicle. A further disadvantage of the device consists in 
the fact that the radar cone of action is not 
sufficiently narrow to eliminate false readings 
even when travelling along a straight road, due to 
the presence in the gutter or on the roadside of 
casual objects of no importance to the real road 
situation. The second device comprises an electronic 
signaller, arranged fixed on the ground near a 
road black spot. The electronic signaller emits a radiation of 
electromagnetic waves. The radiation is continuous 
and is received by a corresponding receiver  
 
arranged on board a vehicle, which activates an 
alarm signal when it receives said signal. The principal disadvantage of the above device is 
that the electronic signaller needs a continuous 
power supply, and of course an electronic 
signaller is needed for every accident black spot 
on the road. Needless to say, this is extremely 
expensive as well as inefficient, since the signal 
must be emitted even when there is no vehicle 
approaching. A further drawback consists in the fact that
