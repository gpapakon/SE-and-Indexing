<ABSTRACT>
An insulating metallic board 160 mounting IGBTs which control an electrical 
power and other circuit elements and an insulating board 170 mounting 

semiconductor elements which control the IGBTs and the other circuit elements are 
arranged adjacent to or closely parallel to each other, and combined by a frame 180 

into one integral circuit board to define a composite board 150. Wiring patterns 
161 and 171 on which the respective circuit elements are to be disposed are formed 

on major surfaces of the same side. Since the composite board 150 which includes 
the two different types of circuit boards can be treated simply as one board, it is 

possible to mount the circuit elements onto the two different types of boards at the 
same time in one fabrication step. Thus, the number of fabrication steps and a 

manufacturing cost are reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a composite
board used in a semiconductor power module, and a method of fabricating a
semiconductor power module.A semiconductor power module is formed by incorporating a main circuit,
which includes a power control semiconductor element which controls a power, and
a control circuit, which includes a control element which transmits and receives a
signal to and from the main circuit to control operations of the main circuit, in one
device. A semiconductor power module is used primarily as an invertor for
controlling operations of a motor and etc.Fig. 23 is a front cross-sectional view of a circuit board 10 which is used
in a conventional semiconductor power module. In a semiconductor power module,
a heat loss which is created in a main circuit should be able to effectively
discharged outside the module. To attain this, a main circuit board 1 on which a
main circuit is seated is formed by an insulating metallic board in the conventional
semiconductor power module. That is, the main circuit board 1 comprises an
insulating layer 3, which is disposed on one major surface of a metallic base plate
2 which has an excellent conductivity, and a main circuit wiring pattern 4 which
is disposed on the insulating layer 3. The main circuit wiring pattern is connected
to a power control semiconductor element which forms the main circuit. Whenever 
a heat loss is created in the power control semiconductor element which passes a
large current and the main circuit wiring pattern, the heat loss is transferred to the
metallic base plate 2, and then radiated to an external heat dissipation mechanism
which is connected to the metallic base plate 2.The insulating layer 3 includes an area in which the main circuit wiring
pattern 4 is not formed. Instead, a control circuit board 5 is fixed on the insulating
layer 3 by an adhesive agent in this area. The control circuit board 5 includes an
insulating circuit board body 6 which is shaped in a plate-like configuration and
a control circuit wiring pattern 7 which is disposed on the both major surfaces of
the insulating circuit board body 6. The control circuit wiring pattern 7 is
connected to a control element which forms a control circuit which processes a
voltage signal. Only very weak current is allowed into the control circuit. For this
reason, the control circuit board 5 includes no special heat dissipation structure.Being formed using such a circuit board 10 as above which includes a
stacked structure in which the control circuit board 5 is
