<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to in-mold
labelling, using die-cut in-mold labels of the kind
adapted to label blow-molded plastic bottles or
other containers. Labelling methods and articles of
this kind are referred to as "in-mold" because the
labels are held in place within the mold wherein the
container is shaped during the container-forming
step.The invention particularly applies to in-mold
labelling using polymeric labels, rather than
using natural cellulose paper labels. Polymeric
labels offer many aesthetic and functional
advantages over paper labels in the labelling of
containers or other articles made by blow-molding
plastic resins, such as high density polyethylene
(HDPE). When a plastic container such as a HDPE
squeeze bottle is used to package a product such as
a hair shampoo, a package using a polymeric label is
generally more appealing to consumers than a package
using a paper label that won't last in the shower
and that does not have as attractive an appearance.
In many applications, the use of polymeric labels is
required for reasons of appearance, handling,
performance, moisture-resistance, conformability,
durability and compatibility with the container to
be labelled. For example, a low-modulus plastic
label is generally required for a squeeze bottle so
that the label can flex with the bottle without
wrinkling or tearing. Polymeric labels also make
possible the manufacture of clear or substantially
transparent labels having a "no-label look" with
only the indicia on the label being readily visible
to the consumer. It is recognized that natural paper labels
are incompatible in the recycling of molded plastic
items. In many applications, in-mold labelling of
natural or light colored plastic containers using
polymeric labels also presents a recycling problem,
both in respect to immediate use of scrap bottles
created during production (particularly during
start-up) and in respect to post consumer recycling.
During production, labels may be applied out of
register with the bottles being formed, particularly
during start-up of the production line when ideal
bottle-forming temperatures and other conditions may
not yet be established and stabilized. The scrap
bottles caused by process control drift or "start-up
bottles" thereby formed cannot be immediately
recycled by grinding or shredding them and re-including
them in the resin supply for the blow-molding
operation. To do so would contaminate the
melt with the printing inks with which the polymeric
labels are decorated. Instead, the mislabelled
bottle
