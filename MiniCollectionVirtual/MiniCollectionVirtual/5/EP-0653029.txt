<ABSTRACT>
A differential mechanism (10) having two output cam members (16, 17) rotatable about an axis (X-X), each cam member having a single annular frustoconical cam surface (22, 23) thereon of undulating form comprising pairs of mutually inclined surfaces (24, 25:26, 27) and a plurality of cam followers (28) having end surfaces (29, 30:32, 33) engaging the cam surfaces (22, 23) of the output cam members (16, 17). Relative contra rotation of the output cam members (16, 17) causes the cam followers (28) to slide axially and an input member (11) engages the followers which are slidably supported by the input member and moves the followers circumferentially relative to the output cam members (16, 17). A locking means (60, 83) is also provided for locking the output cam members (16, 17) and/or the input member (11) against relative rotation to lock up the differential mechanism.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a differential mechanism
particularly but not exclusively for use in motor vehicles.Differential mechanisms commonly used on vehicles are of
the sun and planet gear type and have a well known
disadvantage that when one wheel is on a slippery surface
such as mud or ice and the other wheel is on a firm surface
capable of providing traction, the first wheel will simply
spin as it receives all the available power transmitted to
the differential.Limited slip differential mechanisms have been proposed in
an attempt to overcome this problem which restrict the
extent to which one wheel can spin relative to the other
but such differentials are more complex and, therefore,
most costly to produce.In European patent application EP-A-0326289 there is
proposed an alternative differential mechanism comprising
two output cam members rotatable about an axis, each said
member having a single frustoconical cam surface thereon of
undulating from comprising pairs of mutually inclined
surfaces, and a plurality of cam followers having end 
surfaces engaging the cam surfaces of the output cam
members, the arrangement being such that relative contra
rotation of said output cam members causes the cam
followers to slide axially, and an input member engaging
the followers which are slidably supported by the input
member and moving the followers circumferentially relative
to the output cam members.Such a differential will hereinafter be called a
differential of the type referred to.It is an object of the present invention to provide a
differential of the type referred to which mitigates the
above problems.According to the present invention there is provided a
differential of the type referred to in which locking means
is provided for locking any two of the said members against
relative rotation, the locking means being mounted on the
input member and engaging a cam follower to prevent axial
movement of said follower, and hence rotational movement of
the output cam members. Differential mechanisms in accordance with the invention
will now be described by way of example with reference to
the accompanying drawing in which:-
Fig 1 is a cross section through a differential mechanism
in accordance with the invention taken through output cam
members,Fig 2 is an end view of the differential of Fig 1 shown
partly broken away,Fig 3 is a development of cam surfaces with cam followers
shown in positions there between,Fig 4 is a diagrammatic end view of a follower,Fig 5 is a view on arrow 'A' of Fig 1 showing the

<CLAIMS>
A differential mechanism (10) comprising two output
cam members (16,17) rotatable about an axis (X-X),

each said member having a single annular
frustoconical cam surface (22,23) thereon of

undulating form comprising pairs of mutually
inclined surfaces (24,25:26,27) and a pluralit
y of
cam followers (28) having end surfaces (29,30:32,33)

engaging the cam surfaces (22,23) of the output cam
members (16,17), the arrangement being such that

relative contra rotation of said output cam members
(16,17) causes the cam followers (28) to slide

axially, and an input member (11) engaging the
followers which are slidably supported by the input

member and moving the followers circumferentially
relative to the output cam members (16,17)

characterised in that locking means (60,83) is
provided for locking at least any two of said members

(11,16,17) against relative rotation, the locking
means (60) being mounted on the input member

(11,13,14) and engaging a cam follower (28) to prevent
axial movement of said cam follower, and hence

rotational movement of the output cam members (16,17).
A differential mechanism as claimed in claim 1
characterised in that the locking means comprise a pin 

(60) slidably mounted in the input member (11,13,14).
A differential mechanism as claimed in claim 1 or
claim 2 characterised in that the input member

comprises an input housing (11,13,14) and the output
cam members (16,17) are rotatably mounted within the

housing.
A differential mechanism as claimed in claim 3
characterised in that the pin (60) engages a cam

surface on a lever (62) pivoted relative to the input
housing (11,13,14), the lever being engaged by an

axially movable operating ring arranged coaxially of
the input housing.
A differential mechanism as claimed in any claims 1 to
4 characterised in that the cam surfaces (22,23) are

frustoconical and converge towards each other, and the
input member (11,12,14) engages a radially outer

portion (36) of each cam follower (28) and supports
the two cam output members (16,17) against axially

outward movement during drive of the cam output
members through the cam followers (28).
A differential mechanism as claimed in any one of
claims 1 to 5 characterised in that the locking means

(60,83) is operated by a fluid pressure acutator (72).
