20-methyl-substituted vitamin D derivatives of the general formula I 

 
wherein 


R¹ is a hydrogen atom, a hydroxy group or an alkanoyloxy group having from 1 to 12 
carbon atoms, or a benzoyloxy group, 
R² is a hydrogen atom or an alkanoyl group having from 1 to 12 carbon atoms, or a 
benzoyl group and 
R³ is a saturated or unsaturated, straight-chained or branched hydrocarbon radical having 
up to 18 carbon atoms that is optionally interrupted and/or substituted by one or more 

C₃₋₁₀-cycloalkyl or -cycloalkenyl radical(s), the latter having up to 2 double bonds, and 
that is optionally substituted by one or more hydroxy, oxo and/or amino group(s) and/or 
one or more halogen atom(s) and optionally has one or more oxygen, sulfur and/or NH 

group(s) as bridging chain member(s) in the hydrocarbon radical. 
Vitamin D derivatives according to claim 1, characterised in that R³ is one of the 
following radicals:  

 

 
wherein
 
R = C₁-C₄-alkyl, -hydroxyalkyl or -O-alkyl.

1α,25-dihydroxy-20,26,27-trimethyl-23,24-dehydro-vitamin D₃. 
Process for the manufacture of 20-methyl-substituted vitamin D derivatives of the 
general formula I according to at least one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that a 

compound of the general formula II  
 


 
wherein 


R
1'
 is a hydrogen atom or a protected hydroxy group and 
R
2'
 is an alkali-stable hydroxy-protecting group and 
R
3'
 has the same meaning as R³ in the ultimately desired compound of the general 
formula I, any hydroxy groups that may be present being protected, 
is converted into a compound of the general formula I by removal of any hydroxy-protecting 
groups that are present and optionally by partial or complete esterification of 

the hydroxy group(s). 
Intermediates of the general formula V 

  
 

wherein
 
R
1'
 and R
2'
 have the meanings defined in claim 4, with the proviso that formula (V) is 
different from formula (I) according to claim 1. 
Pharmaceutical preparations, characterised in that they contain at least one compound 

according to claims 1 to 3 and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. 
Use of the compounds according to claims 1 to 3 in the manufacture of medicaments.
