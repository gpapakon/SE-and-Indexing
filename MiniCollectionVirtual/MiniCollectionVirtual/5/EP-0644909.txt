<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of a silicon and
zirconium based lacquer as a substrate coating and
the thus-obtained substrates.Hitherto, studies and efforts have been made to obtain
lacquers endowed with improved technical properties, to be
used as coating for substrates which are typically used in
extremely harsh environments. Examples of coatings which
allow the coated substrates to be used in said harsh
environments are coatings with properties such as:
anti-contamination, anti-scratch, heat-resistance and
refractory properties, low moisture permeability, resistance
to chemicals, insulation properties, oxygen-barrier,
high bulk resistivity, low friction coefficient, and high
adhesion to the substrates.The fields wherein said coatings may be used are varied
and numerous. One can cite, as illustrative, those
fields wherein the coatings provide protection for active and
passive electrical, electronic, optical components and
assemblies thereof against environmental stresses.During the past years, research in the field of microelectronics
has been directed to higher productivity and
devices miniaturisation. Thus, the use of surface-mounted
devices (SMD), rendering high-speed component placement
possible, has lead to significant gain in productivity, the
soldering of such surface mounted devices (SMD) on the
printed circuits now being carried out on the face(s) of the
circuit where the devices are lodged. The two soldering
processes currently used are wave soldering and reflow 
soldering. The first of these two processes, the so-called
wave soldering process, comprises the step of bringing the
printed circuit bearing the SMDs adhered thereon into contact
with a stationary wave formed in a bath of molten solder, the
parameters of temperature and time being respectively about
260 °C and about 10 s for conventional tin/lead solder,
given that the operating conditions vary as a function of the
solder employed. The second process, so-called reflow
soldering, comprises the step of applying solder in the solid
state at the contact pins of the SMD adhered on the printed
circuit board followed by heating, using IR radiation or
vapor phase transfer, of the foregoing assembly at a
temperature of about 220 °C for a period of time of about 30
secs. The component and the substrate are thus submitted to
somewhat drastic thermal conditions, but they must of course
retain their properties, especially electronic properties,
i.e. the shift due to the thermal treatment should be less
than a few percent, typically
