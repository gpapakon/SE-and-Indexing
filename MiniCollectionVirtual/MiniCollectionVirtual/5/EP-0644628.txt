<ABSTRACT>
A right-angle electrical connector comprising a 
plurality of contacts (91) supported on an insulator body 

(90), the contacts having a length equal to one another and 
having opposite ends projecting in different directions 

normal to each other and coming into contact with first and 
second connection objects (93), respectively, to be 

electrically connected by the connector. Each of the 
contacts (91) comprises two portions extending in the 

different directions. The ratio of two portions of each 
one of contacts is different from that of the different one 

of contacts. In order to avoid production of various 
contacts which are different from one another in shape and 

dimension, the connector comprises a main element of an 
insulator substrate (1) and conductive strip lines (3, 5) 

formed thereon, and contact elements (8) like one another 
fixed to the insulator substrate (1) to project from, and 

in directions normal to, adjacent side edges (1a, 1b) of 
the insulator substrate (1), respectively. The conductive 

strip lines have a length equal to each other and first and 
second ends (3a, 5a) near the adjacent side edges and are 

electrically connected to the contact elements (8). The 
contact elements (8) are used for making connection with 

the first and the second connection objects (20, 30).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrical 
connector and, in particular, to an angle connector, 
typically a right-angle printed circuit board connector 
having a plurality of contact portions which are 
substantially equal to each other in the length. U.S. Patent No. 5,173,056 by Kniese et al discloses 
a right-angle circuit board connector. The connector has a 
housing mounted on a printed circuit board and a plurality 
of rows of contacts extending from the housing, each row 
being arranged one above the other. The printed circuit 
board has a plurality of plated through holes laid out in a 
matrix of rows and columns with predetermined grid spacing. 
The contacts of each of contact rows extend to holes of 
corresponding one of the hole rows. That is, the length of 
the portions of contacts extending from the connector 
housing of respective rows is chosen approximately in 
inverse ratio to the length of the portions of the contacts 
bent towards the circuit board. As a result, approximately 
equal overall lengths are obtained for all connector 
contacts and extending from the housing and consequently,  
 
the delay times of signals transmitted via each individual 
contact are also approximately the same. A right-angle connector having a similar 
construction is also disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,167,531 
by Broschard, III et al. In the known right angle connectors, contacts of 
different rows are different from each other in the shape. 
Therefore, contacts having different shapes must be 
prepared in production and for maintenance of the 
connectors. This makes production and management of 
contacts complicated and makes the cost of contacts high. Further, the connector housing has a predetermined 
length for accommodating the number of columns. If the 
columns are different in number, various connector housings 
must be prepared to have different lengths. This also 
makes production of the connector complicated. In order to 
resolve the problem, the connector housing can be prepared 
for a single column. A number of connector housings are 
used for the number of columns. Although this resolves the 
problem of the connector housing, the problem of the 
contacts are not yet resolved. Accordingly, it is an object of the present 
invention to provide an angle connector which requires no 
production of various shape of contacts to thereby enable 
easy production and management of contacts and reduction of 
cost of the contacts and the connector.  
 The present invention is applicable to an 
electri
