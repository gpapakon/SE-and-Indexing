<ABSTRACT>
A method for protecting against duplication of a document with a color copier and a security substrate comprises providing a background color on a document having an average reflectance value and printing on the background with a contrast color having a spectral characteristic which modulates the average reflectance value by no more than 5 % and has an average value equal to the average reflectance value. The contrast color is printed with a printing medium including one of a colorformer leucodye and an activating phenolic resin. The other use of the colorformer leucodye and the activating phenolic resin is to permit the user to verify that the document is an original and not a copy.

<DESCRIPTION>
The advent of color copiers and the tremendous 
improvements recently achieved in the visual quality of 
copies produced by such photocopiers has opened up a new 
area of major concern in the fight against the fraudulent 
duplication and counterfeiting of valuable documents. The almost daily reported cases of fraudulently 
color copied admission tickets to major events, securities 
and high face value redeemable coupons are only a few 
samples of a very large problem. The prior art provides a 
technology where the background of an original document is 
printed by a complex combination of multicolor screens where 
a statement such as VOID or COPY is "hidden" to the casual 
visual scrutiny and upon copying, the screens that carry the 
hidden words become more prominent and hence the latter 
become visible to reveal the copied nature of the document. 
It is important to note that this prior art 
relies on the "revelation" of a "hidden" information. This 
has an inherent weakness which results from the obvious ease 
with which the "revealed" information can always be erased 
or inhibited through successive copyings. As a matter of 
fact it is currently known in the printing trade that while 
on the one hand the successful provision of a  
 
prescribed background on the original is rather 
difficult, on the other hand the inhibition of the 
revealable messages on the copy is relatively easy. As distinctly opposed to the above described 
situation, the present invention consists of placing on the 
original document, through any one of the presently known 
printing processes, background information which is visually 
perceptible and readable, but which upon color copying will 
be washed away thus alarming the user by its absence. The present invention provides a relatively 
simple, but most importantly, a very effective technology 
that results in a radical solution to this problem. Furthermore, this technology is completely 
compatible with all known printing systems and is, 
therefore, particularly suitable for the protection of 
documents, labels and other printed vehicles against 
duplication on color copiers. The central concept of this invention is to impart 
to the background of a document a carefully specified 
optochemical dual characteristic of which neither the 
optical nor the chemical components can be duplicated by a 
color copier. Actually, the very high security provided by 
this technique consists in the fact that when the operator 
fraudulently using the color copier tries to obtain at best

Method for protecting against duplication of a 
document with a color copier, comprising the steps 

of: 

providing a background color on a document having an 
average reflectance value; and 
printing on the background with a contrast color 
having a spectral characteristic which modulates 

about an average value by a modulation amplitude 

which has a magnitude such that it may be discerned 
by the human eye but not by a color copier. 
Method according to claim 1, including an additional 
non-optical verification step involving a substance 

contained in the printing medium which is to provide 
the contrast color. 
Method according to claim 2, wherein said non-optical 
verififcation step is based on a visible color change 

of an information portion of the document resulting 
from a reaction of a colorformer component the color 

formation of which is activated by chemical action of 
an activator to produce said visible color change, 

wherein the step of printing the contrast color 
comprises printing with the printing medium including 

one of 

a) the colorformer component 
b) the activator. 
Method according to claim 3 wherein the other of a) 
or b) is applied to the document during the 

verification step. 
Security substrate for protecting against duplication 
with a color copier, comprising: 


a background color on one main surface having an 
average reflectance value; and 
a contrast color on the background color having a 
spectral characteristic which modulates about an 

average value by a modulation amplitude which has a 
magnitude such that it may be discerned by the human 

eye but not by a color copier. 
Security substrate according to claim 5, containing a 
substance in the printing medium which is to provide 

the contrast color, said substance allowing an 
additional non-optical verification. 
Security substrate according to claim 6, wherein the 
non-optical verification is based on a visible color 

change of an information portion of the document 
resulting from a reaction of a colorformer component 

the color formation of which is activated by chemical 
action of an activator to produce said visible color 

change, said security substrate including one of 

a) the colorformer component 
b) the activator. 
Printing medium for use in the method of claim 2 or 
3, or in the security substrate of claim 6, or 7, 

containing a substance for allowing the non-optical 
verification.  

 
Printing medium according to claim 8, wherein the 
substance is a colorformer component, preferably a 

colorformer leucodye. 
Printing medium according to claim 8, wherein the 
substance is an activator, preferably an activating 

phenolic resin.
