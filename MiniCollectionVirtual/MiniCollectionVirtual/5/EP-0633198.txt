<ABSTRACT>
An article carrier having bottom, top, side and end walls 
interconnected to form an enclosure of rectilinear configuration 

and having a pair of spaced apart hand hole openings 
(27,27a) formed in the 

top wall includes a reinforcing strip (26) secured to the inner surface 
of the top wall and between the hand hole openings. End extensions 

(26a,26b) which may or may not be adhered project from each end of the 
reinforcing strip and are folded into flat face contacting relation 

with the end walls (20a,23a) respectively and are secured thereto. 
The fold 

lines between the end extensions and the cooperating end edges of 
the reinforcing strip are debossed so as to protrude inwardly and 

mate with a complementary embossed area which is encased by torque 
relief slits (42,43,44) thereby reducing the tension along the outer 

surfaces 
of the fold lines between the top wall and the end walls so as 

effectively to strengthen the load bearing elements of the carrier 
top wall.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to hand carried article
carriers and is particularly concerned with the construction of
hand gripping apertures and related reinforcing means.U. S. patent 2,849,112 issued August 26, 1958 discloses
a can carrier of the wrap around type in which the can chimes both
top and bottom are arranged so as to reside in slits formed in the
top and bottom edges of both side walls. Chimed cans under adverse
conditions may tear the end corners of the carrier and thus
effectively destroy the package. A pair of spaced scores are
formed astride an inwardly folded panel and form embossments which
reinforce the carrier at the upper and lower corners thereof at
both ends of the carrier.U. S. patent 2,872,036 issued February 3, 1959 discloses
a paperboard wrap around carrier for cans having inwardly folded
reinforcing strips disposed about the end edges of the carrier and
in which parallel double score lines are formed at the carrier
corners which are out of alignment with the packaged can chimes and
which thereby serve to strengthen the carrier.U. S. patent 2,933,867 issued April 26, 1960 includes an
incidental disclosure of short slits formed at the top and bottom
end corners of the carrier which serve to prevent tearing of the 
carrier structure due to the fact that these small slits are disposed in transverse relation
to the carrier comers and close to the ends of the wrapper both top and bottom.According to this invention in one form, an article carrier having bottom, top, side and
end walls interconnected to form an enclosure of rectilinear configuration includes a
pair of spaced apart hand hole openings formed in the top wall. A reinforcing strip is
secured to the inner surface of the top wall between the hand hole openings and
includes end extensions projecting from each end of the reinforcing strip and folded
into flat face contacting relation with the end walls respectively and secured thereto.
The fold lines between the end extensions and the cooperating end edges of the
reinforcing strip are embossed so as to protrude inwardly thereby to reduce the tension
and the tendency for rupture to occur along the outer surfaces of the fold lines
between the end extensions of the reinforcing strip and the part of the reinforcing strip
which is secured to the carrier top walls so as effectively to strengthen the load
bearing elements of the carrier.According to another aspect of the invention, an article carrier comprising bottom,
top, side and end walls each having an inner surface
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An article carrier comprising bottom (1), top (18), side (6, 12) and end walls
(2, 4, 20, 23) each having an inner surface interconnected to form an enclosure in

which said top wall (18) includes load bearing elements in which adjacent part of said
end walls (20, 23) are associated with said top wall (18), a pair of spaced apart hand

hole openings (27) are formed in said top wall (18), a reinforcing strip (26) having
cooperating end edges secured to the inner surface of said top wall and between said

hand hole openings, fold lines (21, 24) between said top (18) and end walls (20, 23),
end extensions (26a, 26b) projecting from each of said cooperating end edges of said

reinforcing strip (26) and folded along fold lines (26c) into flat face contacting
relation with said inner surfaces of the adjacent end walls (20a, 23a) respectively and

secured thereto, characterised in that the outer surfaces of the fold lines between said
end extensions (26a, 26b) and the cooperating end edges of said reinforcing strip (26)

are debossed and in that the adjacent inner surface of each carrier end wall (20a, 23a)
is embossed to provide complementary surfaces (40, 41) for reducing tension along

the outer surfaces of said fold lines.
An article carrier according to claim 1 wherein the tension between the outer
surfaces of the fold lines between said end extensions (26a, 26b) and the cooperating

end edges of said reinforcing strip (26) have a debossed portion (40, 40A) and the
adjacent inner surface of each carrier end wall (20a, 23a) have an embossed portion

(41, 41a).
An article carrier according to claim 2, wherein said embossed portion having
an inner end and embossed areas of a lesser width than said debossed portion (40,
