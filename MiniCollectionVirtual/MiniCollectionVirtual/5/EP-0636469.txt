<ABSTRACT>
A criss cross coating hopper (10) is provided which is capable 
of producing uniform flow distribution patterns. The hopper 

(10) is comprised of first and second hopper halves (12,14). 
First and second hopper halves (12,14) each have a first and 

second planar surface (20,40,) respectively, adjoining a first 
and second cavity (22,42), respectively, each cavity (22,42) 

having a land surface (28,50) near the entrance end (26,48) and 
exit end (24,46). Inserts (62,64) are positioned against the 

land surface (60) of the first hopper half (12) and the land 
surface (50) of the second hopper half (14), respectively. The 

first and second hopper halves (12,14) and the inserts (62,64) 
cooperate to form an exit slot (69) recessed into first and 

second planar surfaces (20,40).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to coating hoppers, and more particularly,
to a hopper which achieves uniform flow distribution
for emulsions and polymeric materials using criss-cross
flow circuits.In conventional coating hoppers for coating a fluid onto the
surface of a web, such as hoppers for photographic emulsions
and polymeric materials, fluid is delivered into the hopper
through a center inlet passage or an end inlet passage. In
either case, the inlet passage is in fluid communication
with an extrusion slot portion of the hopper via an interior
flow distribution manifold or channel formed in at least one
of the die portions comprising the hopper. In both cases,
achieving relatively uniform widthwise flow distribution at
the extrusion slot is a problem. One way known to accomplish
more uniform widthwise flow distribution is to contour
specially the interior flow distribution manifold and lips
of the extrusion slot. Contouring of the manifold is needed
to offset the pressure loss which must occur between the inlet
passage and the far end of the manifold. Properly done,
this conventional practice is adequate for a specific set of
fluids and flow conditions. However, a shortcoming of this
practice is manifest when there is a change in fluid flow.
Typically, a change in fluid flow alters the pressure relationship
in the manifold to create unacceptable flow distribution,
resulting in excessive fluid accumulation or flooding
in the far end of the manifold. Rather than contouring the manifold, a different flow path
or flow circuit has been shown to evenly distribute the
pressure of the fluid flow in the hopper. One such flow circuit
is the criss-cross circuit in which fluid enters the
inlet channel and crosses as it enters the inlet channel.
However, the added complexity of the passages needed in the
hopper device does require some special method of hopper
construction while maintaining the mechanical stability of
the extrusion slot.The use of some sort of insert device to achieve flow uniformity
of a single stream has been attempted in the prior
art. U. S. Patent No. 4,017,240 to Nelson teaches sheet extrusion
of elastomeric material wherein an extruded strand
is passed through a die having a symmetrical runner system
which divides and subdivides the strand into multiple
strands equal in length and cross section. The strands are
then gradually transformed into laterally adjoining flattened
triangular portions in which substantially the same
cross-sectional area is maintained as the cross-sectional
shape changes.
