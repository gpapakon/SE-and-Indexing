<CLAIMS>
Process for the manufacture of 1-chloro-1-fluoroethane and/or
1,1-difluoroethane by reaction between hydrogen fluoride and vinyl chloride in the

liquid phase, characterized in that the hydrogen fluoride and the vinyl chloride are
introduced into an organic solvent consisting of at least one saturated halogen-containing

hydrocarbon.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that the saturated halogen-containing
hydrocarbon is selected from chloro-, fluoro- or chlorofluorohydrocarbons

containing from 1 to 8 carbon atoms.
Process according to Claim 2, characterized in that a saturated halogen-containing
hydrocarbon of the process or a mixture of halogen-containing

hydrocarbons of the process is used as solvent.
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the
reaction mixture contains, at all times, at least 55% by weight of solvent.
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the
introduction of the vinyl chloride and hydrogen fluoride is controlled so that, at all

times, the vinyl chloride content is less than 15% and that of hydrogen fluoride is less
than 30% of the weight of the reaction mixture.
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the
molar ratio between the hydrogen fluoride and the vinyl chloride used is at least 1 and

does not exceed 20.
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 6, characterized in that the
reaction is carried out in the presence of a hydrofluorination catalyst chosen from

derivatives of metals of groups IIIa, IVa, IVb, Va, Vb and VIb of the Periodic Table
of the elements, and their mixtures, preferably chosen from tin derivatives.
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 7, characterized in that the
reaction is performed at a temperature of at least 40°C and not exceeding 130°C and

at a pressure at least equal to 2 bar and not exceeding 50 bar. 
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 8, characterized in that the
desired product is withdrawn continuously from the reaction mixture.
Process according to Claim 9, applied to the production of
1,1-difluoroethane, characterized in that it is withdrawn in gaseous form.
