<ABSTRACT>
Implants (10) for the electrostimulation of tissues according to the Kraus and Lechner process contain an electric winding or pick-up coil (12) whose terminals are connected by flexible lines (16) to tissue electrodes (18) or their connecting devices. In different therapeutical situations, lines of various lengths and/or various electrodes or electrode connecting devices are in general required. In order to make storage easier, the lines (16) of the disclosed implant are not fixed to the pick-up coil (12), as it was usual hitherto in the case of the implants available to the operating doctor, but are connected by means of a connecting device (14) which allows lines of various lengths and various electrodes or electrode connecting devices to be selectively attached to the pick-up coil. The implant (10) can thus be adapted to different requirements in an economical manner.

<CLAIMS>
An implant for electrostimulation of tissues comprising a pick-up coil member (12) 
which includes at least one electrical pick-up coil winding (28), the ends of which 

being each coupled to at least one terminal, and flexible electrical leads (16) for 
coupling said terminals to tissue electrodes, 
characterized in that
 the terminals of 
said pick-up coil (28) are connected to at least one part (20) of a coupling device 

(14) fixed to and protruding from said pick-up coil member (12) and that each of 
said flexible leads (16) has an end which is complementary to said coupling device 

part and adapted to be connected electrically and mechanically to it. 
An implant according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 said coupling device part 
comprises a bush (138) within which an end of a flexible lead (116) is fastenable. 
An implant according to claim 2, 
characterized in that
 said electrical lead is 
comprised by a hollow strand, and that a pin (140) is provided, which is adapted to 

be inserted into the end of said flexible lead. 
An implant according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the coupling device part of 
said pick-up coil member (12) is comprised by a rigid metal wire (20) protruding 

from said pick-up coil member, and that a bush (22) which is adapted to be fixed to 
said metal wire is attached to an end of each flexible lead (16). 
An implant according to claim 4, 
characterized in that
 said bush has an axial hole 
with barb means, which latches to said metal wire upon pushing said bush onto 

said wire. 
An implant according to claim 4, 
characterized in that
 said bush (22) has an axial 
hole (26) and is adapted to be fixed to said rigid wire by crimping. 
An implant as claimed in any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 a 
plurality of separate flexible leads having different electrodes or electrode coupling 

means are provided for a predetermined type of pick-up coil member (12, 112).
