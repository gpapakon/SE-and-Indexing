<ABSTRACT>
To attach a front panel without difficulty to the external door 
of an automatic vending machine, an external door body 1 is 

equipped with: first guide means 41 having a guide groove 41a 
for gripping the lefthand edge of a front panel 3; second guide 

means 42 having a guide groove 42a for gripping the righthand 
edge of the same; and receiving means 43 having an arcuate 

groove 43a for gripping the upper edge of the same. The front 
panel 3 is inserted into those individual grooves 41a, 42a and 

43a, and a stopper 6 acting as closing means is finally inserted 
in the bottom portion of the external door body 1, to prevent 

the front panel 3 from coming out. At the attaching time, the 
front panel 3 need not be forcibly folded so that the work can 

be eased while avoiding damaging of the front panel 3.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for attaching a 
front panel, which is illuminated from the back for giving an 
advertisement, to the front face of the external door of an 
automatic vending machine. In the aforementioned mounting structure, as known in the 
prior art, a front panel 3 has its upper portion inserted in the 
direction of arrow into an aperture 2 of an external door body 1 
of an automatic vending machine and then has its lower portion 
bent and inserted, as shown in Fig.4, until it is fixed by the 
not-shown backing plate. The structure of the prior art requires a considerable 
force to bend and insert the front panel into the external door. 
Thus, the structure is accompanied by the problems that a 
troublesome work is required and that the front panel may have 
its marking face damaged if it is forcibly inserted. On the other hand, the automatic vending machine of recent 
years has a tendency that it becomes highly fashionable to 
enlarge the space for the front panel or that the front panel 
has its front face curved. Thus, the structure of the prior art 
involves more and more difficulty to attach the front panel. It is, therefore, an object of the present invention, to 
provide a front panel attaching device for an automatic vending 
machine, which can attach even a large-sized front panel without 
difficulty.  
 In order to achieve the above-specified object, according 
to the present invention, there is provided a device for 
attaching a front panel to an automatic vending machine, which 
device is constructed to comprise: first and second guide means 
having guide grooves extending straight in a longitudinal 
direction with a predetermined depth and arranged to face each 
other at a predetermined angle and at a predetermined spacing 
from each other; receiving means having an arcuate groove 
bridging one-side ends of said first and second guide means to 
form one arcuate plane together with said two guide grooves; a 
front panel inserted under a stress in an arcuate form into said 
two guide grooves and said arcuate groove; and closing means for 
closing the other ends of said first and second guide means. In the above-specified construction, the predetermined 
angle formed by said two guide grooves may be an acute angle, 
and said guide grooves may be formed by two generally L-shaped 
plates. Moreover, one of said L-shaped plates may be formed of a 
front plate of the vending machine whereas the other may be 
formed of a backing plate having its leading end opened wide.
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A mounting structure adapted to attach a front panel to an automatic vending 
machine, 
characterized by:
 a) first and second guide means (41, 42) 
having guide grooves (41a, 42a) extending straight in a longitudinal 

direction of the front panel with a predetermined depth and arranged to face 
each other at a predetermined angle and at a predetermined 

spacing (S) from each other; b) receiving means having an arcuate 
groove (43), bridging one-side ends of said first and second 

guide grooves, so that the front panel (3) can be inserted, under a bending stress to assume an 
arcuate form, into said two guide grooves (41a, 42a), and can further be slid along the guide grooves until its curved edge enters said 

arcuate groove (43a); c) closing means (6) for closing the 
other ends of said first and second guide means. 
A device according to claim 1, wherein the predetermined 
angle formed by said two guide grooves (41a, 42a) is an acute 

angle Óúç formed by each of them with an intersecting plane (H). 
A device according to claims 1 or 2, wherein said guide 
grooves (41a, 42a) are formed by two generally L-shaped plates 

(1, 1a; 5, 5a). 
A device according to any of claims 1 to 3, wherein one of 
said L-shaped plates (1a) is formed of a front plate (1) of the 

vending machine whereas the other is a backing plate (5, 5a) 
having its leading end opened wide.
