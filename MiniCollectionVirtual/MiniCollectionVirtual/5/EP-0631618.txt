<ABSTRACT>
Human hematopoietic stem cells may be grown in longterm culture, particularly co-cultures with an appropriate stromal cell line, particularly in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor, by itself or in conjuction with other factors. The cells are found to retain their function as demonstrated by an in vivo T-cell assay and their ability to form colonies of other lineages in methylcellulose. Transfection of the cells may be achieved with a virus, where improved results are obtained in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor and optionally other hematopoietic factors.

<DESCRIPTION>
 CULTURING OF HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELLS AND THEIR GENETIC ENGINEERINGINTRODUCTION Technical FieldThe field of this invention is expansion of human hematopoietic stem cells and their genetic modification.BackgroundThe availability of human hematopoietic stem cell compositions offers a plethora of opportunities for medicine. The hematopoietic stem cell is the progenitor for all of the blood cells, including leukocytes, including lymphocytic and myelomonocytic lineages, and erythrocytes, as well as other types of cells, such as osteoclasts. There is the further possibility, that the stem cell may also lead to stromal cells. These cells provide an enormous range of functions. None of these cells is believed to be capable of self-regeneration, so as to survive during the lifetime of the host. The stem cell is believed to be the only cell that is self- regenerating and maintains its pluripotent potential during the life of the host. Therefore, understanding the role of the stem cell, the manner in which it regenerates, and the manner in which it is programmed to produce the various lineages will provide opportunities for therapies for a wide variety of diseases. The ability to obtain substantially homogeneous human stem cell compositions offers new approaches to bone 

marrow transplantation. Since there is evidence to suggest that the stem cell will not be malignant, by isolating human hematopoietic stem cells, one may avoid restoring malignant cells to a host after radiation or chemotherapeutic treatment of cancer or other malignancy. The stem cells offer an entree to gene therapy, where the modification will survive the life of the host. In addition, by appropriate use of inducible promoters, one can provide that expression of various protein products may be achieved at selected levels of differentiation or in selected lineages, or even in response to particular chemical clues, such as chemoattractants, particular ligands, and the like. Also, as there is better understanding of the manner in which stem cells are directed to specific lineages, there will be the opportunity to produce in culture populations of particular lineages, such as megakaryocytes, subsets of T cells, monocytes, and the like.An important aspect of this invention in the use of stem cells will be the ability to expand the stem cells in culture. Growing stem cells is different from growing other cells, since in order to expand stem cells, one must not only provide for regeneration, but inhibit the loss of stem cells by differentiation. The
