<ABSTRACT>
A nonvolatile magnetoresistive (MR) storage device comprising a 
plurality of MR storage elements, each comprising a substrate and a 

multilayered structure including two thin film layers of ferromagnetic 
material separated by a thin layer of nonmagnetic metallic material. The 

magnetization easy axis of both ferromagnetic layers in each storage 
element is oriented substantially lengthwise of the storage elements and 

substantially parallel to the direction of an applied sense current. The 
magnetization direction of one of the ferromagnetic layers is fixed in a 

direction substantially lengthwise of the storage elements, and the 
magnetization direction of the other layer is free to switch between two 

digital states in which the magnetization is substantially parallel or 
substantially antiparallel to the magnetization direction in the one 

layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to high-performance, nonvolatile storage 
devices, and more particularly to a nonvolatile magnetic random access 
storage device using magnetoresistive storage elements with a spin valve 
configuration. U.S. Patent 5,159,513 discloses a magnetoresistive (MR) sensor 
which utilizes the spin valve effect. The sensor comprises a rectangular 
multilayered structure deposited on a glass or other suitable substrate. 
First and second ferromagnetic layers are separated by a thin copper 
spacer layer. The magnetization of the first layer is fixed in a 
direction across the width of the sensor by use of a hard magnetic 
material as the first layer or, if preferred, by use of an 
antiferromagnetic layer to pin the first layer by exchange coupling. The 
magnetization of the second layer is normally in a direction along the 
length of the sensor, but is free to rotate through an angle determined 
by the magnitude of the magnetic field being sensed. Hence, the sensor 
is a analog type device. A paper entitled "Enhanced Magnetoresistance in Layered Magnetic 
Structures With Antiferromagnetic Interlayer Exchange," published in 
Physical Review B of the American Physical Society, Vol. 39, No. 7, p. 
4828, (1989), notes that antiferrromagnetic coupling between these layers 
results in a strong increase in magnetoresistance effect due to 
antiparallel alignment of the magnetizations in the ferromagnetic film 
layers, making this attractive for applications such as MR field sensors. A paper entitled "Memory Implications of the Spin-Valve Effect in 
Soft Multilayers," published in J. Appl. Physics 69(8), 15 April 1991, at 
p. 5760 et seq., describes a MR storage element that also has certain 
deficiencies hereinafter to be more fully described.  There is a need for a nonvolatile magnetic storage device which 
overcomes these deficiencies, in that it (1) achieves a direct current 
read without requiring state interrogation, (2) utilizes the full δR/R of 
the magnetic layers to achieve high sensitivity, (3) improves read access 
time by obviating the need for lock-in detection, (4) enables reduction 
in the size of the spin valve cell primarily by reducing the width of the 
MR storage element and thus increases the signal level, and (5) enables 
high-speed write and erase operations. Viewed from one aspect the present invention provides a nonvolatile 
magnetoresistive storage device including at least one nonvolatile 
magnetoresistive storage element comprising: a substrate having a 
rectangular
