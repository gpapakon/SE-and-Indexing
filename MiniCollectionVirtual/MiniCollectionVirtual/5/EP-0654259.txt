<ABSTRACT>
A hair conditioner composition is disclosed, which 
comprises (A) a fatty acid having a straight-chain acyl group 

containing 18 to 28 carbon atoms, and (B) a cationic 

surfactant, wherein a weight ratio of component (A) to 
component (B) is from 1.5/1 to 4/1. The hair conditioner 

composition has a beautiful pearl-like appearance, imparts a 
natural gloss to hair, exhibits an excellent UV ray-screening 

effect, and prevents hair from being disheveled during sleep.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a hair conditioner
composition and more particularly a hair conditioner
composition showing a pearl-like appearance (a pearly
luster), having an UV ray-screening effect, imparting a
natural gloss to hair, and preventing hair from being
disheveled during sleep.To impart a pearl-like appearance, fish scale guanine
or an inorganic mineral, such as mica-based synthetic pearl
or titanium dioxide, is contained in some conventional hair
cosmetic compositions. Also, to impart gloss to hair, a
liquid oil or silicone is contained in some conventional hair
cosmetic compositions.However, the inorganic minerals sometimes which are
added in the hair cosmetic composition to impart thereto a
pearl-like appearance sometimes cause a squeaky feel or a
stiff feel to hair. On the other hand, a hair cosmetic
composition containing the liquid oil or silicone can impart
an oily gloss to hair but it hardly produces a natural gloss.It has therefore been demanded to develop a hair
conditioner composition which has a beautiful pearl-like
appearance and is capable of imparting a natural gloss to
hair. EP-A-0 538 762 describes a hair cosmetic comprising a
cationic surfactant, a fat and/or an oil, and an alkyl
saccharide surfactant having a specified formula. The
weight ratio of the cationic surfactant and the alkyl
saccharide surfactant is indicated to be from 1 to 20.
However, no weight ratio is indicated with respect to the
fat and oil and the cationic surfactant.JP-57-56412 describes a hair cosmetic comprising a
quaternary ammonium salt containing a C16-18 alkyl group, a
quaternary ammonium salt containing a C20-22 alkyl group and
a fatty acid as essential components, and capable of
imparting improved luster and smoothness to the hair.
Having regard to the examples of the fat and oil to be used,
a plurality of different compounds such as higher alcohols,
hydrocarbons, lanolin derivatives, higher fatty acid esters,
higher fatty acids and long chain amide amines and vegetable
and animal fats and oils are cited. It is particularly
preferred to use monoglycerides originated from saturated or
unsaturated, straight chain or branched chain fatty acids
having 12 to 24 carbon atoms, and higher alcohols having
straight chain or branched alkyl or alkenyl groups having 12
to 26 carbon atoms.Chemical Abstracts, vol. 97 (1982): 97: 78683x
describes hair rinses containing quaternary ammonium salts
and fatty acid esters. Stearic and isostearic acid are used
to prepare the fatty acid ester.JP-A-0 52 86 831 describes hair
