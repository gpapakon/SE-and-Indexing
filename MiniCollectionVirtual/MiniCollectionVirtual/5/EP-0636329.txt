<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a chair (1) in 
which a base member (3) is fitted onto an upper portion of 

a leg (2) comprising a plurality of castors (2a) in contact 
with a floor together with support members for these 

castors (2a), and a seat portion (5) and a back rest (6) 
are provided on an upper portion of a support plate (4) 

that is capable of reclining with respect to the base 
member (3). This chair (1) is also provided with a cam-shaped 

link (8) capable of rotating about the periphery of 
a pin (7) provided in the base member (3), an upper portion 

of the link (8) protrudes towards the support plate side, 
and an elastic member (9) that is compressed by the 

rotation of the link (8) is provided in a bottom portion of 
the base member (3). A shaft portion (10) in contact with 

the link (8), and which causes the link (8) to change 
profile in response to the reclining action, is provided 

within the support plate (4). This configuration provides 
a chair that is inexpensive and can naturally adopt either 

a serious working position or a relaxed reclining position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an office chair 
and, in particular, to a chair that can naturally adopt 
either of two positions, a serious working position and a 
relaxed reclining position, when a person is seated upon 
it. The typical office chair that has long been used is 
provided with a gas spring and a coil spring as attached 
energy means on the underside of a seat thereof, and the 
configuration is such that large inclinations of a back 
rest are implemented by the gas spring whereas small 
adjustments of the inclination of the back rest in the 
final stages are implemented by the coil spring. However, since a gas spring is used as the 
reclining mechanism for the seat, the manufacturing costs 
are inevitably high, and thus it is extremely difficult in 
the prior art to provide an inexpensive chair, despite all 
efforts to reduce the costs of other components. In addition, since adjustment of the seat back 
reactive force in the prior art makes use of a spring such 
as a coil spring with a single type of spring 
characteristic, it is difficult to implement a natural 
reclining state. In other words, the fault occurs that, 
just by the person sitting, the seat portion and back rest 
of the chair recline backwards, making it difficult to 
achieve a working position, on the other hand, if the 
reactive force of the coil spring is made stronger, this 
makes it difficult to recline backwards, and in that state 
reclining becomes so difficult it is not possible to relax. The present invention was devised in the light of 
the above described problems and has as an objective the 
provision of a chair that is inexpensive and has a 
structure such that it can naturally adopt either a serious 
working position or a relaxed reclining position, and which  
 
is designed to remove the defects of the prior art. In order to achieve the above objective, the 
present invention concerns a chair in which a base member 
is fitted onto an upper portion of a leg comprising a 
plurality of castors in contact with a floor together with 
support members for these castors, and a seat portion and 
a back rest are provided on an upper portion of a support 
plate attached to the base member so as to be is capable of 
reclining with respect thereto. In accordance with this 
invention, this chair is also provided with a cam-shaped 
link capable of rotating about the periphery of a pin 
provided in the base member, an upper portion of the link 
protrudes towards the support plate side, and a 
corresponding elastic member
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A chair (1) in which a base member (3) is fitted 
onto an upper portion of a leg (2) which comprises a 

plurality of castors (2a) in contact with a floor and which 
supports said castors (2a), and a seat portion (5) and a 

back rest (6) are provided on an upper portion of a support 
plate (4) which is capable of reclining with respect to 

said base member (3), said chair (1) comprising: 

a cam-shaped link (8)capable of rotating about the 
periphery of a pin (7) provided in said base member (3), 

and an upper portion of said link (8) protruding towards 
said support plate side (4); 
an elastic member (9) which is compressed by the 
rotation of said link (8) and which is provided in a bottom 

portion of said base member (3); and 
a shaft portion (10) in contact with said link (8), 
and which causes said link to change profile in response to 

the reclining action of said support plate (4). 
The chair of claim 1, further comprising a stopper 
lever (11) for maintaining said (8) link in an upright 

state within said base member (3). 
The chair of claim 1, wherein projections (8a) are 
provided at a central portion and end portions of a front 

side of said link (8), in such a manner that said 
projections come into contact with and compress said 

elastic member (9) when said back rest (6) is inclined 
forward. 
The chair of claim 2, wherein said stopper lever 
(11) has a shape in which two end portions thereof are bent 

in mutually opposite directions with respect to a central 
portion thereof, and one of said end portions is provided 

with a handle (20). 
The chair of claim 2, further comprising a cushion  
 

receptacle (16) provided adjacent to said elastic member 
(9) and facing said elastic member (9), wherein a V-shaped 

notch (16a) is formed in an upper portion of said cushion 
receptacle (16) and, when said stopper lever (11) rotates 

in such a manner that the inner end portion thereof enters 
said notch (16a), said stopper lever (11) comes into 

contact with said link (8) and prevents the forward 
inclination thereof.
