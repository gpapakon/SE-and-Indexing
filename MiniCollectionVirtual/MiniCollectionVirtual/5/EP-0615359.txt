<ABSTRACT>
In a transmitting apparatus (32), information 
signal frame position information is supplied from a 

transmission line frame control unit in a frame const- 
ructing unit (4) to an information signal frame control 

unit provided within a frame constructing unit (3). In 
a reception apparatus (33), information signal frame 

position information is supplied from transmission line 
frame control unit provided within a frame analyzing 

unit (6) to an information signal frame synchronization 
detection protecting unit provided within a frame 

analyzing unit (7). n information signal frames having 
a length which results from dividing the data area of 

the transmission line frame by n are located at an 
arbitrary position within the data area of the transmission 

line frame and a staff control is effected on every 

information signal frame. Also, a value of n which 
yields a staff ratio in which a residual jitter can be 

prevented from being increased is selected by transmitting 
a single information signal by using n information 

signal frames.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
transmitting a digital signal, a digital signal transmission 
and reception apparatus and a digital signal 
transmission apparatus. The SDH (Synchronous Digital Hierarchy) 
network of broad band that is based on the CCITT 
(Comité Consultatif Internationale Telegraphique et 
Telephonique) is constructed now. A demand for video 
transmission services of high quality has been increased 
recently. Concurrently therewith, it is proposed to use 
the SDH network as a transmission line of such high-quality 
video transmission services (e.g., Collection of 
Speech Papers at the Meeting held on Spring 1992 by the 
Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication 
Engineers of Japan, Paper B-710). FIGS. 6 and 10 of the accompanying drawings 
show examples of two kinds of formats of the transmission 
frame according to the conventional transmission 
method in a transmission line based on the synchronous 
digital hierarchy (SDH) network. FIG. 7 shows an 
example of an apparatus which transmits a video signal 
as an information signal by using the method shown in 
FIG. 6. FIG. 11 shows an example of an apparatus which 
similarly transmits the video signal by using the method  
 
shown in FIG. 10. As shown in FIG. 6, there are provided a 
transmission line header 51 and an information signal 
header 52 which includes staff control information. 
There is provided information signal data area which 
includes a staff word (10-bit length). The information 
signal header, the information signal data area and a 
reserve area 57 for future expansion constitute an 
information signal frame 55 which simultaneously 
corresponds to a data area of a transmission line. The 
transmission header 51, the information signal header 
52, the information signal data area 53, the staff word 
54 and the information signal frame 55 constitute a 
transmission line frame 56. As shown in FIG. 7, there is provided an input 
terminal 1 to which a video signal is input as an 
information signal. The video signal applied to the 
input terminal 1 is converted by an analog-to-digital 
(A/D) converting unit 2 in the form of analog to digital 
signal. The output digital video signal from the A/D 
converting unit 2 is supplied to an information frame 
constructing unit 3. The output signal from the information 
signal frame constructing unit 3 is supplied to a 
transmission line frame constructing unit 4. The information 
signal frame constructing unit 3 and the transmission 
line frame constructing
