<ABSTRACT>
A method for producing a yarn for a field of artificial grass by extruding 
a polymer material into a monofilament, stretching the monofilament at 

an elevated temperature, relaxing it to obtain a band and twisting several 
bands together into a yarn, whereby said extrusion takes place via a 

spinning plate having such a form that monofilaments are obtained, which 
in the cross-section have regularly spaced-apart protrusions having a 

height of 10 - 40% of the thickness of the monofilament without 
protrusions, being a thickness of 100 - 700 µm and a width of 1 - 5 mm, 

then said stretching takes place at a stretching ratio between 1 : 2 and 
1 : 10, whereby bands having a thickness of 50 - 350 µm and a width of 

0.5 - 2 mm are obtained after relaxing and cooling, and whereby 
subsequently 5 - 10 bands are twisted together in order to obtain said 

yarn.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for producing a yarn 
for a field of artificial grass by extruding a polymer material into a 
monofilament, stretching the monofilament at an elevated temperature, 
relaxing it to obtain a band and twisting several bands together into a 
yarn. A method of this kind is known from EP-A-417,832, 
wherein a yarn is produced by extruding the granulate and making bands 
having a width of 2 - 3 mm from the extrusion product, which bands have 
a width of 1 - 2 mm after stretching, whilst the thickness amounts to 50 - 
70% of the original thickness of the extruded bands, whereupon 5 - 10 
bands are twisted together into a yarn. It has now become apparent that 
the mechanical properties of the yarn may be improved by giving the yarn 
a predetermined form, obtained by extrusion to monofilaments and by 
stretching them under specific herebelow given circumstances. The method according to the invention is characterized 
in that said extrusion takes place via a spinning plate having such a form 
that monofilaments are obtained, which in the cross-section have regularly 
spaced-apart protrusions having a height of 10 - 40% of the thickness of 
the monofilament without protrusions, being a thickness of 100 - 700 µm 
and a width of 1-5 mm, then strectching takes place at a stretching ratio 
between 1 : 2 and 1 : 10, whereby bands having a thickness of 50 - 350 
µm and a width of 0.5 - 2 mm are obtained after relaxing and cooling, and 
in that subsequently 5 - 10 bands are twisted together in order to obtain 
said yarn. According to the invention the polymer to be used is 
preferably a block copolymer consisting of polypropylene and polyethylene 
marketed by Solvay, Belgium. More in particular the monofilaments have 
a thickness of 100 - 150 µm and a width of 1 - 1.5 mm after stretching. 
This is in particular achieved when stretching ratio of 1 : 3-6 is used. The yarn, produced in accordance with EP-A-417,832 has 
the property that it post fibrillates less than the uptill then known 
yarns, as result of which the life of the yarn is extended and the field 
of artificial grass obtained with that yarn can be played on for a longer 
period of time. The playing-properties can be maintained for a longer 
period of time, because the field will get less compact by the particles 
as fibrilated. Another effect achieved by using the method according to  
 
the invention is that the yarn will become less sensitive to breaking. 
This is in particular achieved by giving the cross-section of the yarn
