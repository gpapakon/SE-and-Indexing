<ABSTRACT>
In MPEG multi-channel audio the decoder requires a respective decoder matrix for 
calculating from the coded audio data the different output channels. Some information 

is transmitted which indicates basic parameters of the multi-channel system. 
This information can be used to address the currently required decoder matrix 

which is stored previously in a decoder memory. Because the storage of more than 
1000 of such matrices is required to enable the decoder to decode all possible 

channel configurations such a decoder will be very expensive. 
Instead of adressing the required decoder matrix stored in a decoder memory, at 
first the current encoder matrix can be reconstructed in the decoder using the related 

transmitted information. Then, the required decoder matrix is computed from 
the reconstructed encoder matrix. This is possible due to the fact that the necessary 

computation time is significant lower than the required computation time for a 
decoder audio signal filter.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for obtaining a multi-channel
decoder matrix and to the use of such method in decoder
devices.There are basic shortcomings of conventional two-channel sound
systems so as to allow enhanced performance in stereophonic presentation
and/or multi-lingual capability. It is recognized that
the improved presentation performance is desirable not only for
applications with accompanying picture but also in case of audio-only
applications. A universal and compatible multi-channel
sound system applicable to sound and television broadcasting,
like satellite or terrestrial TV broadcasting, digital audio
broadcasting (terrestrial and satellite), as well as other non-broadcasting
media, e.g.,
CATVCable TV DistributionCDADCable Digital Audio DistributionENGElectronic News Gathering (including Satellite News Gathering)IPCInterpersonal Communications (videoconferencing, video-phone,
etc.)ISMInteractive Storage Media (optical disks, etc.)NDBNetwork Database Services (via ATM, etc.)DSMDigital Storage Media (digital VTR, etc.)ECElectronic CinemaHTTHome Television TheatreISDNIntegrated Service Digital Network
seems to be very attractive to the manufacturer, producer, and
consumer.The ISO/MPEG-Audio Multichannel system is an audio subband coding
system, which can be used to transfer high quality digital
multi-channel and/or multi-lingual audio information on channels
with limited capacity. One of the basic features is the backwards
compatibility to ISO 11172-3 IS coded mono, stereo or dual 
channel audio programs. It is designed for use in different applications.As regards stereophonic presentation, the use of an additional
center loudspeaker channel C and two surround loudspeaker channels
Ls (or LS) and Rs (or RS) is recommended, augmenting the
front left and right loudspeaker channels L and R. This reference
sound format is referred to as "3/2-stereo" (3 front / 2
surround loudspeaker channels), and requires the transmission of
five appropriately formatted sound signals.For picture accompanying sound applications (e.g. HDTV), the three
front loudspeaker channels ensure sufficient directional
stability and clarity of the picture related frontal images, according
to the common practice in the cinema. The dominant benefit
is the "stable center", which is guaranteed at any location
of the listener and important for most of the dialogue.
Additionally for audio-only applications the 3/2-stereo format
has been found to be the appropriate improvement of two-channel
stereophony. The addition

Method for obtaining in a decoder a multi-channel (L, R,
C, Ls, Rs) decoder matrix which corresponds to an encoder

matrix and which is required for recovering an encoded
digital 
audio signal from a bitstream which has been encoded
using said encoder matrix, wherein in header bits

in the bitstream an indication information is included
which comprises channel on/off data, channel factor data,

and channel allocation data, 
characterised by
 the steps:

determining from said indication information the number
of channels and therewith the encoder matrix size, and

inserting 0/1 matrix elements corresponding to said channel
on/off data into the corresponding positions within

said encoder matrix to be reconstructed;
determining from said channel factor data further matrix
elements and inserting them into corresponding further

positions within said encoder matrix to be reconstructed;
determining from said channel allocation data the remaining
matrix elements and inserting them into the remaining

positions within said encoder matrix to be reconstructed,
wherein the encoder matrix defines how the original channel

signals before matrixing have been combined in order
to obtain matrixed channel signals for transmission;
performing a matrix inversion of the reconstructed encoder
matrix in order to obtain said decoder matrix.
Method according to claim 1, wherein basic left and right
channel signals in the bitstream are compatible with the

ISO 11172-3 standard.
Usage of the method according to claim 1 or 2 in a TV receiver,
a VCR, a CD player or a multi-channel sound system.
