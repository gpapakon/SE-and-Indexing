<ABSTRACT>
A machine tool, in particular a machine tool with a long bed, comprises a column (11), traversable in at least one first axis (13), and at least one spindle (15, 16) rotatably clamped in the area of its two outer ends (20, 21) at supporting points (22, 23). The spindle (15, 16) extends parallel to the first axis (13) and is connected to the column (11) in such a way that the column (11) is traversed in the first axis (13) during rotation (26) of the spindle (15, 16). A damping device (28) acting on the spindle (15, 16) between the supporting points (22, 23) is provided in the machine tool. The damping device (28) dampens any vibrations of the spindle (15, 16).

Machine tool, in particular a long-bed machine tool, having 
a column (11) that is displaceable at least in a first 

axis (13), and at least one spindle (15, 16) that is 
rotatably clamped at support points (22, 23) in the region 

of its two external ends (20, 21), and that extends parallel 
to said first axis (13) and is connected to said column 

(11) such that upon rotation (26) of said spindle (15, 
16) the column (11) is displaced in the first axis (13), 

and a damping mechanism (28) acting on said spindle (15, 
16) between said support points (20, 21) for damping 

possible vibrations of said spindle (15, 16), characterized 
in that the damping mechanism (28) is independent from 

said column (11) and is displaced along said spindle (15, 
16) in that said damping mechanism (28) can be brought 

at least temporarily in bearing contact with the moving 
column (11) by means of at least one stop (44). 
The machine tool of claim 1, characterized in that the 
spindle (15, 16) is connected to the column (11) by means 

of a nut element (17) that is fastened onto the column 
(11), whereby the damping mechanism (28) acts on the spindle 

(15, 16) on both sides of the nut element (17). 
The machine tool of claim 1 or 2, characterized in that 
the damping mechanism (28) comprises at least one bearing 

element (26) that encircles the spindle (15, 16). 
The machine tool of claim 3, characterized in that the 
bearing element (36) is axially and radially movable with 

respect to the spindle (15, 16).  
 
The machine tool of claim 3 or 4, characterized in that 
the damping mechanism (28) comprises at least two bearing 

elements (36; 37, 38) that are spaced apart in the direction 
of the first axis and joined to one another by a spacer 

element (41). 
The machine tool of any of claims 1 through 5, characterized 

in that the damping mechanism (28) is guided displaceably 
along the first axis (13), on a guide apparatus (29) running 

parallel to the spindle (15, 16). 
The machine tool of claim 6, characterized in that the 
damping mechanism is guided on the guide apparatus (29) 

such that forces (56; F
z
, F
y
) exerted by the spindle (15, 
16) on the damping mechanism (28) and oriented substantially 

transverse to the first axis (13) are absorbed by the guide 
apparatus (29). 
The machine tool of claim 5 or of claim 5 and any of claims 
6 or 7, characterized in that the two bearing elements 

(36; 37, 38) are held by the spacer element (41) at a 
distance (47) from one another that is approximately equal 

to half the displacement distance (46) of the column (11) 
in the first axis (13). 
The machine tool of any of claims 3 through 8, characterized 
in that the bearing element (36) comprises at least one 

ball bearing (37, 38) with a decomposable inner sleeve 
(50). 
The machine tool of claim 9, characterized in that the 
inner sleeve (50) comprises a two-part plastic inner ring 

(51).
