<ABSTRACT>
A recording apparatus records an image on a
recording medium by scanning by a recording head.

Mask data for masking record data is set in registers,
a record timing signal synchronized with

the scan of the recording head is counted up by a
counter, and the mask data set in the registers is

selected by selectors in accordance with the count.
The selected mask data is logically ANDed with the

record data to drive the recording head.
A load to software is reduced and the recording
is attained while the record data is masked with a

simple construction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a recording
apparatus which scans a recording head to record an
image on a recording medium.A printer which records characters and images
on a sheet material (recording medium) such as a record
sheet or plastic sheet has been known, and an image
forming process adopted in such a printer includes a
wire dot system, an ink jet system and a laser beam
system. Such a printer includes a serial type in which
a carriage carrying a recording head is scanned to
record, a line print type in which a line head is used
to print by line and a page print type in which
recording is made by page. Of those, in a serial ink
jet printer, an ink jet head (recording head) is
mounted on a carriage which is laterally and
reciprocally driven by a carriage motor along a
longitudinal direction of a platen, and the ink jet
head is driven in synchronism with the scan of the
carriage so that ink is discharged from ink discharge
nozzles to form an image on a record sheet.As a demand for high quality recording recently
increases, the recording head becomes more and more 
high density and an ink jet printer equipped with an
ink jet head (recording head) having nozzles (recording
elements) of 360 dots per inch (dpi) has become common,
and plain papers as well as the sheet material
specially designed for the ink jet are permitted for
printing. As the recording density of the recording
head increases, a process of receiving image data in
bit form and recording it in graphic has become common.In order to record such graphic data with a
high quality by a serial printer, white stripes or
black stripes which appear along the reciprocal
movement direction of the carriage (main scan
direction) and along a sub-scan direction orthogonal to
the main scan direction should be prevented. Where the
printer is a color printer, the generation of color
irregularity in the recorded image should also been
prevented.When printing is made on a recording medium
such as a plain paper or an OHP sheet, the absorption
of ink is worse than the sheet specially designed for
the ink jet so that a time for the ink to be fixed on
the recording medium should be reserved. To this end,
a density of ink deposited on the recording medium in a
predetermined time must be reduced. However, in the
color printer, since inks of different colors are
recorded at the same position, it is difficult to lower
the ink density below a certain level. In order to solve the above problem, as shown
in Fig. 16, nozzles of a recording head having 64
nozzles are
