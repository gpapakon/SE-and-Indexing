<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the present invention is ketonic indane derivatives and their heterocyclic analogues which correspond to the general formula: 
<

  in which   X, Y and Z are, independently of one another, a carbon atom or a nitrogen atom; B is chosen from an oxygen or sulphur atom or a radical R1N where R1 is a hydrogen atom or a C1 to C5 alkyl radical, A is a nitrogen atom or a radical R2N where R2 is a hydrogen atom or a C1 to C5 alkyl radical, Ar is an aromatic or heteroaromatic ring having one or a number of substituted or unsubstituted hetero atoms, R3 is a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom or a radical NxR4R4' where x is an integer from 1 to 2 and R4 and R4' are hydrogenated or oxygenated monovalent C1 to C5 organic radicals.
