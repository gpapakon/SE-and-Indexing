<ABSTRACT>
According to the invention a reinforcing fibre of nonoxide ceramic or carbon type for the manufacture of a composite material with a glass, vitroceramic or ceramic matrix is treated by a process which includes the stages consisting in: if necessary, oxidising the fibre at the surface or depositing thereon a layer of the same composition but including oxygen; introducing the fibre into a vessel for chemical deposition in vapour phase; performing a pretreatment at a temperature of 850 to 1250 DEG C in the presence of hydrogen at a pressure of 50 to 300 mbar; injecting a mixture of inert carrier gas and ammonia; stopping the injection and adjusting the pressure to a value of 1 to 10 mbar; injecting AlCl3 in an inert diluent gas; performing a deposition of AlN on the fibre by simultaneous injection of a mixture of AlCl3 and of inert carrier gas and of a mixture of NH3 and of inert carrier gas until the desired thickness of AlN is obtained; after stopping the injection cooling under a stream of inert gas; and recovering the fibre. Application to the manufacture of composite materials exhibiting good resistance to oxidation.

A process for treating a non-oxide ceramic or a 
carbon reinforcing fibre, which can be used in the 

manufacture of a composite material having a glass, glass-ceramic 
or ceramic matrix exhibiting good oxidative 

stability up to temperatures in the vicinity of 1200°C, for 
a prolonged period, characterized in that it essentially 

comprises the successive steps consisting of: 

if necessary, oxidizing the fibre superficially 
or depositing thereon a layer of the same composition but 

including oxygen; 
placing the fibre in a chemical vapor deposition 
vessel, in an arrangement such that the gases can circulate 

freely within the vessel; 
carrying out a pre-treatment of the fibre in the 
vessel at a temperature selected in the 850 to 1250°C range, 

in the presence of hydrogen, at a pressure of 50 to 300 
mbar; 
injecting into the vessel a mixture of neutral 
carrier gas and ammonia in a volume ratio of 20 to 60; 
stopping injection of the mixture and setting 
the pressure inside the vessel to a value of 1 to 10 mbar; 
injecting into the vessel aluminium chloride in 
a neutral diluting gas; 
producing a deposit of aluminium nitride on the 
fibre by simultaneously injecting into the vessel a mixture 

composed of aluminium chloride and neutral carrier gas, in a 
volume ratio of 0.05 to 0.3, and a mixture composed of 

ammonia and neutral carrier gas, in a volume ratio of 0.01 
to 0.05, the two mixtures being used in a volume ratio of 

0.5 to 2, until the desired thickness of aluminium nitride 
is obtained; 
stopping the injection of the gaseous 
mixtures;  

 
cooling the vessel with a stream of neutral gas; 
and 
extracting the fibres thus treated from the 
vessel.

6, characterized in that aluminium chloride is present in a 

proportion of about 45 % by volume in the neutral diluting 
gas. 
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 
7, characterized in that the time for which aluminium 

chloride in a neutral diluting gas is injected is 5 to 20 
minutes. 
A process according to any one of claims 1 to
