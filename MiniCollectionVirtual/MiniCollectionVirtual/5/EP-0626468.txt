<ABSTRACT>
Process for carbonitriding a steel comprising:
 

   0.75 - 1.1 % by weight of C;
 

   up to 1.0 % by weight of Si;
 

   less than 0.015 % by weight of P;
 

   up to 0.5 % by weight of Mo;
 

   up to 1.2 % by weight of Mn;
 

   0.5 - 2 % by weight of Cr,
 

   the remainder being Fe,
 

by exposing it at elevated temperatures to an atmosphere comprising at 
least carbon monoxide, hydrogen, nitrogen and added ammonia. This is 

carried out by exposing it, between 780 and 900°C, for from 1 to 10 
hours, to an atmosphere comprising at least carbon monoxide, hydrogen and 

ammonia with a carbon activity between 0.90 and 1.10 and a nitrogen 
potential between 0.10 and 0.60 % N.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for carbonitriding a 
steel comprising: 
0.75 - 1.1 % by weight of C; up to 1.0 % by weight of Si; less than 0.015 % by weight of P; up to 0.5 % by weight of Mo; up to 1.2 % by weight of Mn; 0.5 - 2 % by weight of Cr, the remainder being Fe,  
by exposing it at elevated temperatures to an atmosphere comprising at 
least carbon monoxide, hydrogen and ammonia. Such a steel grade is 
disclosed by US Patent No. 4961904. Such steel grades are used, for 
example, for rings and rolling elements of rolling bearings. For general 
applications, this steel is found to be particularly suitable for roller 
bearings. It has been found, however, that for certain applications in 
which a high static load arises, the steel has to be subject to more 
stringent requirements. Relevant examples include bearings used in 
gearboxes of vehicles and in alternators. The object of the present invention is, without further 
alloying of the abovementioned steel and at comparatively low cost, to 
change the structure of this universally used steel in such a way that 
better properties are obtained for these particular uses. This object is achieved in a process described herein above by 
the steel being exposed, for from 1 to 10 hours, at a temperature between 
780 and 900°C, to that atmosphere whose composition is such that the 
carbon activity (ac) is between 0.90 and 1.10 and that a nitrogen 
potential Npot in balance with the atmosphere arises, measured directly on 
the surface, of 0.1 - 0.6 % by weight of N. Such a nitrogen potential can 
be measured by means of foil analysis. By carbonitriding with such a high 
carbon activity, highly alloyed martensite is produced on the surface of 
the steel. As a result, the static capacity, toughness, fatigue strength 
for rolling contact and wear resistance are improved. This process for obtaining highly alloyed martensite differs 
from the processes known hitherto. It has been proposed in the prior art 
to employ, in order to obtain highly alloyed martensite grades, either a 
steel grade having a high carbon content or to employ higher hardening 
temperatures or to apply a combination of these two. This does, however,  
 
have the drawback that the structure does not remain fine-grained, the 
toughness decreases and the amount of retained austenite increases, as a 
result of which dimensional stability decreases. The thermal treatment according to the invention produces 
enrichment of the surface with carbon and nitrogen. No cementite is 
produced
