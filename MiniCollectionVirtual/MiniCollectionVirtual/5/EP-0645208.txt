<ABSTRACT>
The invention discloses a method for the automatic cutting 
and turning of tubes in a cutting machine which comprises: 

a step for cutting a tubular section (53) from a tube (5) 
by means of a cutting tool (131, 133) belonging to a rotating 

head (3); a step during which said tubular section 
(53) is displaced, said step is suited to define between 

said tubular section (53) and said tube (5) a space (55) 
for the passage of at least a pair of turning tools (132, 

134); one or more turning steps of said tube (5) and of 
said tubular section (53) in correspondence with the cut 

area. The rotating head (3) which realizes such a method is 
complete with saddles (31, 33; 32, 34) moving radially, 

each of them supporting a cutting tool (131, 133) or a 
turning tool (132, 134).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a cutting machine for the automatic cutting
and turning of tubes.It is a known fact that the cutting machines for tubes are
tool machines which work by gradually removing shavings off
tubes of indefinite length until these are subdivided into
a plurality of tubular sleeves.According to one of the known embodiments, said cutting
machines, which usually present an automatic working cycle,
essentially consist of a base which supports tube holding
elements which fasten said tube innerly co-axial with a
rotating head complete with cutting tools.During the working cycle the tube remains still, the rotating
head causes the cutting tools, which are attached to
it, to rotate radially by means of displacing means until a
tubular sleeve of the desired length is cut off the tube.The tube cutting machines belonging to this known technique,
which can be equipped with automatic devices for the loading
and the feeding of the tube and for the unloading of
the cut tubular sleeves, present, however, some limitations.A first limitation consists in that said cutting machines
do not allow any turning operation on the pieces, i.e. no
turning operation can be performed either inside the tube
nor inside the tubular sleeve at their facing ends, where
the cutting operation has been performed, since said ends
remain positioned very close to each other and therefore,
do not allow the insertion of tools suited to perform the
inner turning operations.At best with said cutting machines belonging to this known
technique, it is possible to perform at the facing ends of
the cut pieces only chamfering operations on the outer edge
and burring operations on the inner edge by assembling 
special tools on the machines themselves.This entails the need for the tubular sleeves to be further
machined on other tool machines such as for instance lathes,
when it is required that said tubular sleeves are
turned either on their interior or their exterior.FR-A-2 155 761, which represents the closest state of the art,
discloses a cutting machine for tubes further comprising
displacing means belonging to said cutting machine
and suited to define between the two part of the cut tube a
space for the passage of a pair of chamfering tools for
working the edge of the cut tube. No means are provided to
machine the surface of the cut tube in a parallel direction
in respect of the axis of the tube.It is with the purpose of overcoming said limitations that
the present invention is disclosed.More specifically it is the purpose of this

<CLAIMS>
A cutting-off machine for automatic cutting and turning
of tubes comprising:


a rotating head (3) equipped with saddles (31, 33; 32,
34) for the support of said at least one cutting tool (131,

133) and of at least a pair of turning tools (132, 134),
the body (30) of said rotating head (3) presenting a

a first vise (6) suited to hold said tube (5) placed in
correspondence with said rotating head (3);
a second vise (7) suited to hold said tube (5) at its end
and placed below said rotating head (3) and co-axial with

said first vise (6), and able to be moved axially in relation
to said first vise (6), through displacing means,

while the first vise (6) is stationary in relation to the
cutting machine;
at least one cutting saddle (31, 33) supporting at least
one cutting tool (131, 133) and at least a pair of turning

saddles (32, 34), each of them supporting at least one
turning tool (132, 134), said saddles belonging to said

rotating head (3) and being provided with kinematic mechanisms
suited to permit the advancement motion of each of

said tools,
characterized in that
 each of said turning saddles (32, 34)
consists of a first mobile element (232, 234) coupled with

the body (30) of said rotating head (3) by means of at
least one first prismatic guide (432, 434) placed hortogonally

in relation to the axis (51) of the tube (5) to be
machined and of a second mobile element (532, 534) coupled

with said first mobile element by means of at least one
second prismatic guide (652, 654), placed in a slanted

position in relation to the axis (51) of the same tube (5)
