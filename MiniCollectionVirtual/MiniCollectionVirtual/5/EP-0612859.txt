<ABSTRACT>
The invention specifies a low voltage arc evaporator in which the evaporation material is fed from below into the evaporation zone and which permits continuous vacuum coating of substrates in conjunction with a low technical outlay. The low voltage arc evaporator has a guide (5) with a vertical bore (12) in which rod-shaped evaporation material (11) is guided and held. The guide (5) is arranged in an electrically insulated fashion relative to the vacuum chamber (1) and is watercooled. Outside the vacuum chamber (1) is the feed device, which has a cooled receptacle (21) for the rod-shaped evaporation material (11). The feed device is mechanically connected to the vacuum chamber (1) via a metal bellows (20) in an electrically insulated fashion. The rod-shaped evaporation material (11) is connected via the receptacle (21) to the anode potential of the low voltage arc discharge. According to the method, the low voltage arc evaporator can be used to evaporate a plurality of materials which are fed into the evaporation zone in a rod/tube combination.
