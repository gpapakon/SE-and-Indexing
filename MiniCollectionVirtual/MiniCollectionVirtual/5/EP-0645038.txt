<DESCRIPTION>
 AN INTEGRATED CIRCUIT C.A Î©This invention relates to an integrated circuit card and to a method of manufacturing such a card.An integrated circuit card is a card incorporating one or more electronic components, including an integrated circuit, capable of storing and, when activated by external means, processing data. Such cards may be used for storing personal data, and authorising and controlling monetary and other transactions, for example. The card of the invention may, for example, be of the type disclosed and claimed in our UK Patent No. 2173623.In a known technique for the manufacture of such cards, as disclosed and claimed for example in our UI Patent Application No. 2219960, the card comprises an insert consisting of a flexible substrate upon which are formed conductive tracks and to which the or each of the electronic components are adhered and provided with electrical connection to the tracks. The insert is adhered to a high tensile polyester skin in a mould, with a second skin spaced from the first at the opposite side of the mould space, and a reactive liquid polymer mix is injected into the space between the skins. The mould is then closed and, under the action of heat, the liquid polymer cures to a solid polymeric body. While the cards produced by such a process are satisfactorily durable, there can be a tendency for the 

surface of the card to follow the contours and outline of the insert within the card to a small degree. While this has no adverse effect on the operation of the card, its appearance can be slightly marred.Additionally, there are difficulties in handling a liquid reactive polymeric material.It is an object of the present invention to provide a method of manufacturing an integrated circuit card wherein the aforesaid disadvantages are minimised or overcome.According to the present invention, a liquid reactive polymeric material is replaced by a curable polymer/filler mix having a consistency of dough and hereinafter referred to as a polymeric dough.Accordingly, the present invention provides a method of manufacturing an integrated circuit card, the card comprising an insert including at least one electronic component, the method comprising the steps of mounting at least one electronic component on a flexible substrate having a conductive circuit, providing electrical connectors between the or each electronic component and the circuit, mounting the insert on a first layer of a polymeric dough curing the first layer, and locating a second layer of a polymeric dough on the
