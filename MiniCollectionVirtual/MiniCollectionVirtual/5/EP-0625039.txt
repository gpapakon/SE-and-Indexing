Preparation for use on the skin, comprising 
excipients, a drug carrier encapsulating beta-carotene 

and a mixture of UV-A and UV-B sunscreen agents, 

characterized
: 

in that the drug carrier, consisting of nanospheres, 
represents from 3 to 6 % of the weight 

of the preparation; 
in that the proportion of UV-B screening agents 
is higher than those of the UV-A screening 

agents; 
and in that the UV-B screening agents possess 
a cinnamic structure. 
Preparation for use on the skin according 
to Claim 1, chararacterized in that the nanospheres in 

the form of spherical particles encapsulating beta-carotene 
have a collagen and glycosaminoglycan membrane. 
Preparation for use on the skin according 
to either of Claims 1 and 2, characterized in the UV-A 

and UV-B screening agents represent from 4 to 15 % of the 
weight of the preparation. 
Preparation for use on the skin according 
to Claim 1, characterized in that the UV-B screening 

agent is octyl methoxycinnamate or a cinnamic derivative. 
Preparation for use on the skin according 
to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the 

excipients contain a mixture of fatty acid oils, anti-oxidants 
and preservatives. 
Preparation for use on the skin comprising 

excipients, drug carriers encapsulating beta-carotene and 
a mixture of UV-A and UV-B screening agents, characterized 

in that it contains, per one hundred parts: 

3 to 6 %, and preferably 4 %, of nanospheres 
encapsulating beta-carotene; 
4 % of octyl methoxycinnamate (UV-B screening 
agent); 
3 % of butylmethoxydibenzoylmethane (UV-A 
screening agent),  

 
1 % of preservative, 
0.1 % of an ion-chelating agent, 
0.3 % of a gelling agent based on modified 
cellulose, 
0.6 % of an agent for adjusting the pH, 
 
the remainder to 100 % consisting of demineralized water 

and a mixture of excipients in common use for a cutaneous 
application.
