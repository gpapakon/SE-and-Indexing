<ABSTRACT>
Olefinic compounds are selectively oxidized using hydroperoxides, especially aqueous 
solutions of hydrogen peroxide in high yield and with good selectivity in the presence of a 

titania-supported titanosilicate catalyst. Dilute aqueous hydrogen peroxide solutions may be 
used with good results. The resulting epoxidation, even when carried out at modest 

temperatures and with dilute aqueous hydrogen peroxide solutions, afford superior results in 
epoxidation relative to TS-1.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of producing a catalyst comprising
a titanosilicate impregnated on titania by hydrothermal crystallization of the
titanosilicate.One of the most challenging and formidable tasks in preparative organic chemistry is
the selective functionalization of hydrocarbons. Once a functional group has been introduced
the chemist has a rich selection of tools to achieve further transformations and transpositions,
but the initial barrier of introducing a functional group is determinative of further chemistry.
Not only is it necessary that a given functionalization reaction proceeds in good yield, but it
is necessary also that it proceeds with specificity. One of the most chemically attractive entry
points to functionalization of hydrocarbons is the carbon-carbon double bond in alkenes and
substituted alkenes, for the carbon-carbon double bond undergoes many reactions which
introduce functional groups onto one or both of the carbons, and the double bond also
activates an adjacent C-H bond (i.e., allylic hydrogen) to still other reactions. Among the
chemical reactions of the carbon-carbon double bond that of epoxidation occupies a special
niche, because epoxidation is virtually unique to the C=C linkage, because epoxidation
proceeds with great specificity, and because the resulting epoxide is a controllably reactive
functional group which reacts with a wide range of reagents, schematically represented here
as H-Y, to afford an equally wide range of difunctional materials according to the reaction.
Although epoxidation may be performed with several different reagents, that variation
of greatest interest here is one where the reagent is a hydroperoxide, particularly where
epoxidation is catalyzed by a titanium compound. A commercial process uses tertiary butyl
or ethylbenzene hydroperoxide in combination with 2% titania supported on silica to epoxidize
propylene to propylene oxide with greater than 97% conversion of, for example, ethylbenzene
hydroperoxide and selectivities to propylene oxide formation approaching 90%. More recently
an Italian group has developed catalysts, referred to as titanium silicalites, where small
amounts of framework silicon in silicalite are said to be replaced by titanium and has found 
such materials conveniently designated as TS-1, to be effective in catalyzing
the epoxidation of olefinic compounds by hydrogen peroxide in either the
presence or absence of a solvent; see US-A-4410501 and EP-A-0100119
(corresponding to US-A-4833260). Subsequently this
