<DESCRIPTION>
The convenience of administering a single dose of a 
medication which releases active ingredients over an 
extended period of time as opposed to the administration 
of a number of single doses at regular intervals has long 
been recognized in the pharmaceutical arts. The advantage 
to the patient and clinician in having consistent and 
uniform blood levels of medication over an extended period 
of time are likewise recognized. The conventional approaches to sustained release can be 
disadvantageous when the medicament is administered orally 
because certain classes of active ingredients are not 
suited to absorption during passage through the gastro-­
intestinal tract due do their physiochemical properties 
and/or favorable sites of absorption. Penicillin, for 
example, is fully absorbed at one point in the intestine. 
Once the dosage unit containing penicillin passes this 
point under the influence of peristaltic movement, the 
remaining penicillin is not absorbed into the blood stream, 
but is excreted. Most medicaments will undergo varying degrees of change in 
solubility by passage from the strongly acid conditions of 
the stomach to the neutral and to the alkaline conditions 
of the intestines. Additionally, there are medicaments, 
e.g. antacids which are intended to act in the stomach and  
 
therefore lose most beneficial properties when they pass 
into the intestine. The advantages of sustained release dosage forms, which 
are retained in the stomach, for example, by floating in 
the gastric fluid, slowly releasing their therapeutic 
contents into the gastric fluid for passage through the 
intestinal tract, will be readily apparent. These include 
(1) increased contact time for local activity in the 
stomach, where such is required, as in the treatment of 
stomach ulcers, (2) increased and more efficient absorption 
for drugs which have specific absorption sites, and (3) 
the ability to reduce the number of dosages. A number of patents disclose therapeutic dosage forms 
which float on the gastric fluid and have sustained relea­
se capabilities. In a series of U.S. Patents (Nos. 
4 126 672; 4 140 755; 4 167 558), Sheth and Tossounian 
claim compressed tablets and capsules containing from about 
20% to about 75% by weight of one or a mixture of hydrocol­
loids as carriers for therapeutic agents. The hydrocolloids 
recited in the examples and in the claims are cellulose deri­
vatives including methylcellulose, hydroxyalkylcelluloses and 
carboxymethylcellulose. The products are said to be in

1. A method of forming a non-compressed tablet having a 
density of less than one and capable of floating on gas­

tric fluid in vivo which comprises forming a solution of 
gelling agent in water, cooling said solution but not to 

the point where gelation takes place, adding a therapeutic 
agent with stirring, pouring the resultant suspension 

into a tablet mold and letting it stand in the mold to 
form a gel, and drying the molded gel tablets to reduce the 

water content, characterized in that the aqueous suspension 
contains 0.5 to 4 % gelling agent, 25 to 40 % therapeutic 

agent, 0 % oil and the balance is water, all by weight 
based on the total weight, and the dried non-compressed 

tablet contains 2 to 6.5 % gelling agent, 75 to 92.5 % 
therapeutic agent, 0 % oil and the balance is water, all 

by weight based on the total weight of the tablet. 
2. A method of forming a non-compressed tablet having a 
density of less than one and capable of floating on gastric 

fluid in vivo which comprises forming a solution in water 
of one or more gelling agents selected from the group consis­

ting of agar, agarose and a mixture of locust bean gum 
with either agar, agarose, alginic acid and carrageenan, 

cooling said solution but not to the point where gelation 
takes place, adding a therapeutic agent with stirring, 

pouring the resultant suspension into a tablet mold and 
letting it stand in the mold to form a gel, and drying the 

molded gel tablets to reduce the water content, characteri­
zed in that the aqueous suspension contains 0.5 to 4 % 

gelling agent, 25 to 40 % therapeutic agent, 0 % oil and 
the balance is water, all by weight based on the total 

weight, and the dried non-compressed tablet contains 2 to 
6.5 % gelling agent, 75 to 92.5 % therapeutic agent, 0 % 

oil and the balance is water, all by weight based on the 
total weight of the tablet. 
3. A therapeutic composition in unit dosage form as a 
non-compressed tablet having a density of less than one 

and capable of floating on gastric fluid in vivo compri­
sing a matrix formed from a gelling agent, a therapeutic 

agent and water, characterized in that, in percentages by 
weight based on the total weight of the tablet, the latter 

contains 2 to 6.5 % gelling agent, 75 to 92.5 % therapeu­
tic agent, 0 % oil and the balance is water. 
4. A therapeutic composition in unit dosage form as a non-­
compressed tablet having a density of less than one and 

capable of floating on gastric fluid in vivo comprising a 
matrix formed from one or more gelling agents selected 

from the group consisting of agar, agarose and a mixture 
of locust bean gum with either agar, agarose, alginic acid 

and carrageenan, a therapeutic agent and water, characteri­
zed in that, in percentages by weight based on the total 

weight of the tablet, the latter contains 2 to 6.5 % gelling 
agent, 75 to 92.5 % therapeutic agent, 0 % oil and the 

balance is water. 
5. The method according to claim 2 in which the therapeutic 
agent is theophylline. 
6. The composition according to claim 4 in which the thera­
peutic agent is theophylline.
