<ABSTRACT>
Diffusion resistant refractory such as alumina for 
containment of destructive fluorine and fluorine compounds 

in the molten salt oxidation of fluorine-containing organic 
waste, formed of a porous refractory such as porous alumina 

impregnated with a salt such as sodium carbonate, which is 
non-reactive with the refractory and compatible with the 

molten salt reaction medium, thereby effectively blocking 
diffusion baths for fluorine and its compounds from the 

molten salt bath through the refractory. Conventional 
refractories such as alumina bricks containing about 1 to 

about 25% open porosity can be placed in a molten liquid 
salt such as molten sodium carbonate, in a vessel which can 

be pressurized to force the molten sodium carbonate into the 
pores of the alumina brick to impregnate same and form 

alumina brick resistant to diffusion of fluoride-rich molten 
salt.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the destruction of 
organic waste in a molten salt medium, and is particularly 
directed to an improved molten salt vessel formed of 
diffusion resistant refractory for containment of molten 
salt used in a reaction for oxidative destruction of 
fluorine-containing organic waste and for preventing 
diffusion of destructive fluorine and fluorine compounds 
from said organic waste into the refractory brick forming 
the wall of the reaction vessel, and preventing destruction 
of the brick. Molten salt oxidation (MSO) has been demonstrated 
to be a suitable technology for destroying hazardous organic 
wastes. The technology achieves this destruction by the 
catalytic oxidation of the organic compounds by molten salts 
at elevated temperatures. Certain of such organic wastes 
comprise fluorine-containing compounds such as Freons, which 
are chloro-fluoro methanes, and halons, which are similar to 
Freons, but contain a mixture of bromine and fluorine atoms,  
 
and which may also contain chlorine atoms, instead of just 
chlorine and fluorine atoms. Conventional refractory bricks such as alumina 
bricks employed to form the wall of molten salt reaction 
vessels for containing molten salt, e.g. at 1000°C, contain 
extensive open porosity, e.g. in the 2 to 20% range which 
accelerates diffusion of destructive fluorine and fluorine 
compounds such as the Freons and halons, into the brick. 
This leads to rapid destructive phase changes in the 
refractory or brick, such as alumina. Thus, for example, molten salt oxidation normally 
employs sodium carbonate for the molten salt. When applied 
to hazardous fluorine-containing wastes, a reaction product 
will be sodium fluoride. Sodium fluoride is particularly 
reactive with and destructive of the alumina refractory or 
brick. It has been found that the above problem can be 
solved by pre-impregnating the refractory or brick forming 
the wall of the molten salt reaction vessel with a salt or 
salt mixture which is non-reactive with the composition of 
the refractory and which is compatible with the molten salt 
reaction medium.  Thus, for example, where alumina is employed as 
the refractory for the molten salt reaction vessel, alkali 
carbonate, e.g. sodium carbonate, or mixtures thereof with 
alkali halide, such as sodium chloride, can be impregnated 
into the brick microstructure, such salts being non-reactive 
with the alumina brick, thereby effectively blocking the 
diffusion paths for fluorine compounds such as sodium 
fluoride formed
