<ABSTRACT>
A method is disclosed for forming an ionically bonded dinitramide salt or acid useful as a stable oxidizer for solid fuel rocket propellant or explosive formulations is disclosed. The dinitramide salt is formed by the reaction of an N(alkoxycarbonyl)N-nitroamide and a nitronium-containing compound, at a temperature of from about +60  DEG C to about -120  DEG C, followed by contacting the reaction mass with a base to form the dinitramide salt, or an alcohol to form the corresponding dinitramidic acid. The N(alkoxycarbonyl)N-nitroamide may be formed by first mixing the corresponding alkylcarbamate with an anhydride of one or more 1-20 carbon organic acids, then adding nitric acid to the reaction mixture. If the salt of the N(alkoxycarbonyl)N-nitroamide is to be formed, a base is then added until the pH reaches about 7-10. The nitronium-containing reactant may be a covalently bonded compound containing an NO2-group; a nitryl halide; or a nitronium salt having the formula (NO2

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for forming dinitramide 
salts, and/or dinitramidic acid. Solid oxidizers, such as ammonium perchlorate or potassium 
perchlorate, have been used in the past in rocket propellant 
formulation because of their improved ease of storage over 
liquid oxidizers. However, the presence of a halogen in the 
solid oxidant produces a visually observable smoke trail which 
is also observable on radar as well. Also, chlorine poses a 
serious atmospheric environmental hazard of ozone depletion 
and acid rain. Because of such shortcomings in he use of perchlorate solid 
fuel oxidizers, other materials, including nitrate (NO3 -) 
compounds, have been investigated in the search for oxidizers 
which would provide the desired energy density and stability, 
without the drawbacks of the perchlorate oxidants. In the prior art, it is known to react a nitronium salt with 
an organic nitramine to form a covalently bonded N,N-dinitramine 
compound. For example, in U.S. Patent 3,428,667 
Hamel et al describe the reaction of an ionic nitronium salt 
with a primary organic nitramine to form N,N-dinitramines 
having the general formula R-[N(NO₂)₂]n where n is 1-2 and R 
is a monovalent or divalent organic radical. These compounds  
 
are said to be highly energetic and useful as ingredients in 
propellant, explosive, and pyrotechnic compositions. However, the formation and use of covalently bonded nitrogen-containing 
solid fuel oxidizing agents for use in rocket 
propellant formulations is not as desirable as the use of 
dinitramide salts disclosed for example in WO-A-9119670 
because the salts have been found to be much more stable. 
However, the processes for forming such stable dinitramide 
salts have been multiple step processes involving the 
formation of precursors which must then be isolated or 
recovered for a further reaction with another reactant to form 
the desired ionically bonded dinitramide salt product. It 
would be desirable to provide a simplified process to form an 
ionically bonded stable dinitramide salt wherein one reaction 
vessel may be used to form the dinitramide salt product. It would also be desirable to provide a method for the 
formation of such dinitramide salts which would provide a high 
yield, i.e., ∼50%, while only using one mole of nitronium 
reactant per mole of other reactant, as opposed to reacting 
one mole of ammonia with two moles of nitronium-containing 
compound. In accordance with these objectives, and in accordance with 
this invention there is now
