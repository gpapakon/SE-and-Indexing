<ABSTRACT>
The exterior-handle arrangement has a bearing bow 1 which can be premounted on the inside of the exterior door panel 5 and into which are already installed the pull rod 3, which is separate from the door handle 2 and is pretensioned by a compression spring 32 and which acts on the lock-release lever 41, and a holding-plate arrangement 46 for the lock cylinder 4. The door handle 2 and the lock cylinder 4 can be fitted at a later date from outside by snapping in, even when the door is closed. The door handle 2 is thereby brought, at its bearing end 20, into engagement with a bearing journal 11 of the bearing bow 1, whilst there is obtained between the pull rod 3 and the door handle 2 a coupling device 27 which allows a relative transverse movement of the pull rod 3 in relation to the door handle 2 and consequently a close guidance and additional sealing of the pull rod 3 in a guide orifice 24 of the bearing bow 1 by the use of an O-ring 26.

An external handle arrangement for a door, in particular a 
motor vehicle door, comprising a mounting bracket (1) which is fixed on 

the inside to the outer door panel (5), a door handle (2) which is 
arranged substantially on the outside of the outer door panel (5) and 

preferably in or over a handle recess and which engages at a mounting end 
(20) with a mounting arm (21) through a mounting opening (14) in the 

outer door panel (5) and which is mounted pivotably on the mounting 
bracket (1) and which is connected at the other actuating end (23) to a 

pull element (3) which projects through an actuating opening (15) in the 
outer door panel (5) and a guide opening (24) in the mounting bracket (1) 

and which is biased into a retracted position and which upon being pulled 
out by outward pivotal movement of the door handle (2) acts on a lock 

release lever (41), and a lock cylinder (4) which is adjacent to the pull 
element (3) and which is accessible through an outer door panel opening 

(16) and which is secured in position by means of a holder (52), 
characterised in that the pull element is a pull bar (3) which is 

separate from the door handle (2) and which is guided linearly and all-around 

in a guide opening (24), which is completely adapted to the pull 
bar cross-section, in the mounting bracket (1) and which is connected to 

the door handle (2) by way of a coupling means (27) which permits the 
pull bar (3) relative transverse movements with respect to the door 

handle (2). 
An external handle arrangement according to claim 1 
characterised in that there is provided a sealing ring (26) which seals 

off the pull bar (3) in the guide opening (24) in the mounting bracket 
(1). 
An external handle arrangement according to claim 1 or claim 2 
characterised in that the coupling means (27) has between the pull bar 

(3) and the door handle (2) a retaining element (28) so that the 
actuating end (23) of the door handle (2) can be coupled to the pull bar 

(3) by being pressed in from the outside of the door.  
 
An external handle arrangement according to claim 3 
characterised in that the coupling means (27) has a retaining pin (28) 

with a compression spring. 
An external handle arrangement according to one of claims 1 to 
4 characterised in that the mounting end (20) of the door handle (2) can 

also be brought into engagement with the mounting portion (11) of the 
mounting bracket (1) by being inserted from the outside of the door. 
An external handle arrangement according to one of claims 1 to 
5 characterised in that arranged on the outer door panel (5') on the 

outside is a cover shield (67) which forms a pivotal guide for the door 
handle (2'). 
An external handle arrangement according to claim 6 
characterised in that the cover shield (67) guides the handle limb (29) 

which is coupled to the pull bar (3') at the actuating end (23') of the 
door handle (2'). 
An external handle arrangement according to claim 6 or claim 7 
characterised in that the cover shield (67) can be mounted by being 

pressed in from the outside of the door and is latchable to the mounting 
bracket (1') or the outer door panel (5'). 
An external handle arrangement according to claim 8 
characterised in that the cover shield (67) has two oppositely 

resiliently deflectable holding arms (78) with hook-shaped retaining 
projections (80) and with inclined surfaces (81) for a dismantling tool 

which bears thereagainst and which can be introduced from the end of the 
door into a release position. 
An external handle arrangement according to claim 9 
characterised in that the mounting bracket (1') has at least one guide 

slot (86, 87) for the dismantling tool.  
 
An external handle arrangement according to one of claims 6 to 
10 characterised in that the cover shield (67) is provided with a 

receiver (74) for remote actuation of the door locking system. 
An external handle arrangement according to one of claims 1 to 
11 characterised in that the mounting bracket (1') is fixed to the outer 

door panel (5') by way of a clamping means (88) having a tolerance-compensating 
adjusting screw (93). 
An external handle arrangement according to one of claims 1 to 
12 characterised in that associated with the pull bar (3') is a 

tolerance-compensating member (61, 63) which is displaceable in the
