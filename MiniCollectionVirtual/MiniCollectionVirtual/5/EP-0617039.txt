<ABSTRACT>
Metallic silicon for the Rochow synthesis is divided up to give measurements of at least 5 mm in the smallest dimension and 15 mm in the largest dimension, cooled from a temperature of at least 700@C in the course of a maximum of 2 seconds to at most 120@C, then ground and reacted.

<CLAIMS>
A process for the preparation of organochlorosilanes by
the direct reaction of metallic silicon with organyl

chlorides, characterized in that a metallic silicon is
used which prior to the reaction is reduced down to

sizes of at least 5 mm in the smallest dimension and 15
mm in the largest dimension, heated to at least 700째C,

cooled from a temperature of at least 700째C to at most
120째C within a maximum of 2 seconds by introduction into

liquid nitrogen, water or methyl chloride, and
subsequently ground.
A process according to claim 1, characterized in that
cooling is performed from a temperature of at least

900째C.
