<ABSTRACT>
A process for the preparation of mouldings for dentistry with improved mechanical characteristics and better tolerability, in particular of dentures, parts thereof or orthodontic appliances, by chemical polymerisation of resin systems based on poly(meth)acrylate with the aid of hardening catalysts, is characterised in that the resin systems used contain, besides hardening catalysts, additionally at least one photoinitiator, and after the chemical polymerisation the residual monomer content of the moulding is reduced by subsequent irradiation with the rays which activate the photoinitiators to induce photopolymerisation.
