<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a 
method of processing white liquor 

obtained from the causticization stage 
of a pulp mill. According to the method, 

the white liquor, which principally 
contains sodium hydroxide (6) and sodium 

sulfide, is oxidized into polysulfide 
liquor (3), whereby the sodium sulfide 

is oxidized most advantageously with the 
help of a catalyst and an oxidizer such 

as air substantially into sodium polysulfide 
(7) and sodium thiosulfate. The 

method according to the invention is 
characterized in that the sodium 

hydroxide (6) contained in the white 
liquor is separated from the white 

liquor prior to the oxidizing step or 
from the polysulfide liquor (3) after 

the oxidizing step either entirely or 
partly by means of a diffusion dialysis 

process (4). The invention is further 
characterized in that the sodium 

hydroxide (6) separated from the white 
liquor is returned to the chemical 

circulation of the pulp mill.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method according to the 
preamble of claim 1 for producing sodium hydroxide from 
white liquor. The closed-cycle operation of the chemical cycles of a 
sulfate pulp mill is by no means a novel idea. However, 
trials in this direction have not gained wider practical 
application mostly due to the corrosion problems involved. 
Such drawbacks are related to the bleaching method employed 
based on the use of chlorine chemicals. Bleaching is a step 
of the pulp mill that has been resistant to closed-cycle 
operation of its chemical circulation. Efforts to lower the 
environmental pollution load are reflected in the pulp 
market in such a manner that presupposes abandoning the use 
of chlorine chemicals. This in turn has promoted the 
adoption of oxygen-, peroxide- and ozone-based bleaching 
processes. The processes consume purified NaOH even more 
than the conventional chlorine bleaching method. 
Simultaneously, oxygen-peroxide bleaching methods allow 
closed-cycle operation of the bleaching stage chemical 
circulation, because the washing waters of the bleaching 
stage are free from chlorine compounds. If the chemical 
circulation is closed for the pulp bleaching stage, a 
situation will occur in which excess sodium accumulates in 
the chemical balance sheet. Removal of such excess from the 
chemical circulation is extremely difficult in practice. As 
to its chemical circulation, a conventional pulp mill 
(plant without the bleaching stage) operates in an auto-balance 
with respect to sodium and sulfur. Herein, the 
chemical losses of the pulping process can be compensated 
for by adding sodium sulfate to the soda furnace. To attain 
a balanced Na:S ratio also in the production of TCF (totally 
chlorine free) pulp, the NaOH required in the bleaching 
stage must be produced from the chemical circulation.  
 In the conventional, open bleaching process using a chlorine 
chemical for pulp bleaching, the alkaline extraction 
steps require 20-60 kg NaOH per ton of pulp. As the system 
is open, the same amount of NaOH will be lost with the 
washing waters in the plant sewer. The purified NaOH used 
as the make-up chemical is purchased from external 
suppliers. The commercial production of such purified 
sodium hydroxide is principally carried out according to 
the conventional methods described below: The most common method of producing NaOH is electrolysis of 
sodium chloride. Basically it comprises decomposition of 
salt (NaCl) into its elemental constituents (Na) and (Cl2).

A method of processing white liquor obtained from the 
causticization step of a pulp mill, in which method the 

infeed white liquor, which principally contains sodium 
hydroxide and sodium sulfide, is prior to the processing step

partly by means of a diffusion dialysis process (4) using a 

cationic ion exchange membrane.
