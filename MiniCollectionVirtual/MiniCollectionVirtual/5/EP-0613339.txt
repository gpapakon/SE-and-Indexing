<ABSTRACT>
The apparatus (1) holds the connecting strip (4) as well as the belt start (6) and belt end (7) in the pins (5). The hold-down device (3) fixes the belt ends to prevent them from falling out. The connecting strip (4) is folded by means of the pressing lever (2) and is pressed onto the top of the belt ends, so that they are now connected at the bottom and top. The connection of the covering strip on the belts can be accomplished using the remainder of the connecting strip. The remaining pieces of the connecting strip which still project must be cut away after removal of the belts from the opened apparatus. Using this method, apparatuses and connecting strip, a belt connection and a covering strip connection are produced which withstand loads irrespective of the belt dimensions, width, depth and material thickness, and lead to a major reduction in the stationary time in the automatic fitting of electronic components.
