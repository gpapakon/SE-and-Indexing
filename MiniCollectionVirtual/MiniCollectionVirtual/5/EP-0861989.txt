<ABSTRACT>
The assembly to mount a rotating hollow cylinder at its outer circumference, at a bearing or drive at an end side, has an elastic ring (8) round the end side of the hollow cylinder (10). It is pressed against the cylinder mantle by a clamping disc (4), keyed to the bearing or drive (2).

<CLAIMS>
Coupling between a rotatably mounted cylinder (1)
and a bearing or driving unit (2, 3, 13), which components

are axially orientated, and the associated ends of which
are resiliently interconnected, for which purpose a

clamping device is provided, which has an annular groove
which is open towards the external periphery of the

cylinder (1) and includes a resilient ring (8), said
clamping device pressing the ring against the external face

of the cylinder and, for its part, being non-rotatably
connected to the bearing or driving unit to establish the

coupling, characterised in that the cylinder is configured
as hollow cylinder (1), and the clamping device is provided

as clamping disc (4), which presses the ring (8)
independently and surrounds only the hollow cylinder (1),

said clamping disc being securedly screw-connected to the
end face of the bearing or driving unit (2, 3, 13) by-means

of individual screws (11, 12), which are distributed around
.the periphery of the clamping disc (4).
Coupling according to claim 1, characterised in
that the clamping disc (4) comprises a double clamping disc

(5, 6), which secures the hollow cylinder (1) via the
clamping disc (5, 6) independently of the connection with

the bearing or. driving unit (13).
Coupling according to claim 2, characterised in
that the two clamping discs (5, 6) are interconnectable

and, for their part, are connectable to the bearing or
driving unit (13) by means of screws (9, 10; 11, 12) which

are distributed around the periphery of the hollow cylinder
(1).
Coupling according to one of claims 1 - 3, to which
the bearing or driving unit is connected, characterised in

that the bearing or driving unit (13) comprises a 
cylindrical flanged ring (13), which is preferably in

alignment with the hollow cylinder (1) in respect of its
internal diameter and is connected to a housing (18 - 20),

which carries the hollow cylinder (1), via a bearing (15),
which includes the flanged ring (13) externally.
Coupling according to claim 4, to which the
bearing or driving unit is connected, characterised in that

a toothed wheel (17) is mounted around the flanged ring
(13), the driving pinion of a motor engaging in said

toothed wheel to drive the hollow cylinder (1).
