<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process and devices for casting components in metal alloys on the tilt casting principle in which a quantity of melt metered for casting is spread over a large gate cross section without turbulence from a melt container of the mould (30) into the mould (31) by rotating the casting device (1). To prevent the formation of oxide and weak structural points, the melt is taken from a metering furnace under a protective gas in a melt container connected to the mould and taken thence into the mould also under a protective gas. The melt hardens there under increased gas pressure on the feeder region of the casting, whereby its properties such as fine-grained, dense structure, high stability under load and accurately dimensioned surfaces are considerably improved.
