<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a positive-acting radiation-sensitive mixture with: a) a compound which forms an acid under the effect of actinic radiation, b) a compound with at least one C-O-C- or C-O-Si bond which can be split by this acid and c) a polymeric binder which is insoluble in water but soluble or at least swellable by aqueous alkaline solutions, in which the compound (a) corresponds to the general formula: R1(-SO2-R2)n, in which R1 is an n-valent (C1C3)alkane radical, R2 are the same or different and are aryl, aralkyl, heteroaryl or heteroaralkyl radicals and n is a whole number from 2 to 4. The radiation-sensitive mixture of the invention has high resolution and great sensitivity over a wide spectral range. It also exhibits great thermal stability and does not form any corrosive photolysis products on exposure. The invention also relates to a radiation-sensitive recording material made therefrom which is suitable for making photoresists, electronic components and printing plates or for moulding etching.
