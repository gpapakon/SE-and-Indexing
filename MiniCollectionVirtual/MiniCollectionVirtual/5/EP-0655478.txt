<ABSTRACT>
Cellulose sponge using non-woody pulp as raw 
material and a method of producing the same. According to 

the present invention, cellulose sponge can be produced 
without using wood pulp, with using vegetable cellulose of 

low plants, shrub, or the like to contribute to the 
prevention of the forest destruction and provide the way to 

use the waste material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to cellulose sponge 
using vegetable cellulose as raw material obtained from non-woody 
material like stem, leaves and seed skin of low plants, 
shrub, or the like, and to a method of producing the 
cellulose sponge. Instead of synthetic resin sponge made of foamed 
urethane and the like which has been conventionally used, 
recently sponge using vegetable cellulose as raw material has 
been developed and receiving attention with respect to the 
higher antifungal properties of the raw material and the 
easier disposal as waste after being use (that is, the 
disposal is easy such that the sponge dose not generate gas 
which otherwise would affect adversely environment when being 
incinerated). Compared with the synthetic resin sponge which 
has been produced with using flon (chloro fluoro carbons) 
gases which have bad influences on the ozone layer and 
accordingly been regulated, the cellulose sponge has also 
been receiving attention in that it can be produced with  
 
using known expanding agents without using flon gases. Such cellulose sponge is produced by taking out 
vegetable cellulose from wood as raw material, and the method 
of producing the sponge is such that at first, the wood of 
the raw material is made into chip, and then the chip is 
dissolved to obtain pulp (cellulose). Then, the dissolved 
pulp is treated with a sodium hydroxide solution, and 
thereafter, treated by being subject to the addition of a 
chemical such as carbon bisulfide and sodium hydroxide to 
obtain viscose, which becomes liquid having somewhat 
viscosity. Then, the obtained viscose is mixed with an 
expanding agent comprising sodium sulfide and the like to 
expand and coagulate the mixture. Thereafter the mixture is 
expanded and coagulated. The expanded product obtained by 
such coagulation is cleaned by a softening agent, a bleaching 
agent, a weak acid solution and the like, whereby the above-mentioned 
cellulose sponge is obtained. As a post-treatment, 
the sponge is subject to dehydration and drying, and then the 
raw cloth thereof, when subject to cutting processing, is 
made moist and cut into lengths each of which is then packed. Now, since recently the forest destruction has been 
regarded as serious, the necessity of selecting proper 
material instead of wood as raw material of cellulose sponge 
has been discussed, and thus the possibility of increasing 
cost has become a concerned matter.  Therefore, in the view of the above-mentioned 
circumstances, an object of the present
