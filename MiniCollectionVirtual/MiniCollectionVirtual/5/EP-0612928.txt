<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to magnetic
bearing devices of the positive type (control type)
for contactlessly supporting a rotary body by a
plurality of magnetic bearings each comprising a
plurality of electromagnets according to the preamble of
claims 1 and 3.Already known as such magnetic bearing
devices are those of the five-axis control type
comprising an axial magnetic bearing and two radial
magnetic bearings. JP-A-02 097 714 discloses an example of such a magnetic bearing device which is in accordance with the preamble of claim 3.With the magnetic bearing device of the five-axis
control type, the axial magnetic bearing comprises
a pair of (two) electromagnets arranged as opposed to
each other axially of the rotary body, and each of the
radial magnetic bearings comprises two pairs of (four)
electromagnets arranged at equal spacings (90 deg)
circumferentially of the rotary body. Thus, the axial
magnetic bearing comprises two electromagnets in total,
the radial magnetic bearings are composed of eight
electromagnets in total, and the entire bearing device
comprises ten electromagnets in total.The conventional magnetic bearing devices of 
the positive type therefore have a large number of
electromagnets, which are responsible chiefly for the
extremely high cost of the device. In view of the
likelihood of the electromagnetic system malfunctioning,
the fact that the device has a large number of
electromagnets further poses a problem in the reliability
of the device.Further US 3 155 437 A discloses a magnetic bearing device with two axial-radial magnetic bearings according to the preamble of claim 1.The JP-A-61 052 411 discloses a magnetic bearing in which three attracting
electromagnets are arranged in circumferential direction of a rotary body.
The gap between each of the magnetic poles and the rotary body is determined
from two displacement signals (δx,δy), and the magnets are controlled accordingly.The main object of the present invention is
to provide a magnetic bearing device which is reduced
in cost and improved in reliability by decreasing the
number of component electromagnets.To comply with these objects, the invention is characterized by the features
of claims 1 and 3.In a first mode of practicing the present
invention, there is provided a magnetic bearing device
comprising a rotary body having two bearing faces spaced
apart axially thereof and tapered in directions opposite
to each other axially thereof, two axial-radial magnetic
bearings for contactlessly supporting the rotary body
