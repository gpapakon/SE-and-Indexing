<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing 
N-(2-pyrimidyl)piperazinyl butyl imides with tranquilizing effect 
characterized by the following formula(1) through a new intermediate. 
wherein n is equal to 0 or 2. Yao Hua Wu, et al, U.S. Patent No 3,717,634 disclose methods for 
synthesis of N-(hetero arcyclic)-piperazinylalkyl azaspiroalkanediones 
including the following. 
In the above reaction scheme , "n" is the integer 4 or 5, "M" comprises 
an alkali metal salt such as sodium or potassium : "X" inter alia is 
chlorine, bromine, iodine : and the symbol "A" connecting the 
spiroglutarimide and the N-(heteroarcyclic)piperazine represents a divalent 
alkylene chain of 2 to 6 carbon atoms inclusive. The symbol "B" 
represents inter alia various heterocyclic radicals including "2-pyrimidinyl". 
The instant process differs from the Wu, et al., U.S.Pat. No 3,717,634 
Patent process above in that the N-(2-pyrimidyl)piperazinyl fragment is 
introduced by alkylation of performed N-(cis-4-halo or 
sulfonyloxy-2-butenyl)imide with N-(2-pyrimidyl)piperazine and 
hydrogenation is carried out. It is an object of the present invention to provide a novel process of 
preparing N-(2-pyrimidyl)piperazinyl butyl imides. The present invention involves the synthesis of novel 
N-(2-pyrimidyl)piperazinyl-2-butenyl imides which upon hydrogenation 
form N-(2-pyrimidyl)piperazinyl butyl imides (I) having 
psychopharmacologic properties. Imides (I) can, if desired, be converted to suitable salt. The instant invention relates to a process for preparation of 
N-(2-pyrimidyl)piperazinyl butyl imide characterized by formula (I) 
wherein n is equal to 0 or 2 obtained by hydrogenation of 
N-(2-pyrimidyl)piperazinyl-cis-2-butenylimide charaterized by formula (II) 
which comprises alkylating N-(cis-4-halo or sulfonyoxy-2-butenyl)imide 
of general formula (III) 
with a N-(2-pyrimidyl)piperazine characterized by formula (IV) 
wherein X is chlorine, bromine, iodine, lower alkyl sulfonyloxy, phenyl or 
4-methyl phenyl sulfonyloxy.  The compound of formula (III) comprises alkylating imide characterized 
by formula (V) 
with cis-1,4-dihalo or disulfonyloxy-2-butene characterized by formula 
(VI) 
wherein n and X each are as defined previously. The process of the invention is illustrated in the following reaction 
scheme. 
As shown reaction scheme, imide (V) is reacted with 1∼3 equivalent of 
cis-1,4-dihalo disulfonyloxy-2-butene (VI) in the presence of base to 
obtain mono-substituted compound (III). The reactants are combined
