<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a mechanical 
device for automatically turning over and stretching 
preformed dough portions in bread processing and 
making systems, which has been specifically designed 
for preparing bread pieces having an elongated and 
flat shape. As is known, there are at present broadly 
used industrial systems for processing and making 
bread. These systems usually comprise a plurality 
of bread processing devices which are cascade arranged 
and connected to one another by a suitable 
conveyor belt, some of these devices being specifically 
designed for processing the comonents for forming 
the bread dough. After having prepared the bread dough, the 
prepared dough is subjected to a natural leavening 
step, which is followed by a step in which there 
are prepared dough portions suitably cut and shaped, 
depending on the specific pieces of bread which must 
be made. The last making step of the above mentioned 
systems is that of introducing the pre-formed bread  
 
pieces into baking ovens. For preparing bread pieces having an elongated 
and flat shape, more specifically the so-called 
"slipper" shaped bread pieces, there are at present 
performed stretching and turning over operations 
on said bread pieces, before the baking step thereof, 
said stretching and turning over operations being 
usually manually performed. EP-A-0 392 584 discloses an apparatus 
for stretching and turning over dough pieces. Thus, this operation is a comparatively long 
one, and necessarily requires an operator for performing 
it manually. Moreover, this same operation, as at present 
performed, also involves serious hygienic problems. Accordingly, the aim of the present invention 
is to overcome the above mentioned problems and 
drawbacks, by providing a mechanical device, spefifically 
designed for application to bread processing 
systems, which is specifically adapted to automatically 
turn over and stretch preformed dough 
pieces. Within the scope of the above aim, a main 
object of the present invention is to provide such 
a device which allows to quickly stretch and turn  
 
over preformed bread pieces, under very good hygienic 
conditions. Another object of the present invention is 
to provide such a device which, owing to its constructional 
features, is very reliable and safe in 
operation and, moreover, can be easily made starting 
from easily available elements and materials. Yet another object of the present invention 
is to provide such a bread processing device which 
is very competitive
