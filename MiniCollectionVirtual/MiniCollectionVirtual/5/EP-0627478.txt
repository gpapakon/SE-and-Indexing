<ABSTRACT>
An all natural, starch-based, alkaline corrugating adhesive free of 
formaldehyde and other crosslinking and water resistance additives and having 

good water resistant properties comprising an aqueous dispersion of a gelatinized 
carrier starch and a raw ungelatinized starch wherein the carrier starch has a 

total amylose content of greater than 60% by weight and the gelatinized starch 

amylose content is at least about 15% by weight of the total starch content in 
the adhesive.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an all natural, starch-based corrugating adhesive
providing water resistance without containing water resistance additives or
chemical crosslinkers. More particularly, this invention is directed to a
corrugating adhesive composition comprising an aqueous dispersion of a selected
gelatinized carrier starch and a raw ungelatinized starch wherein the carrier
starch has an amylose content of greater than 60% by weight and the cooked or
gelatinized amylose content is at ieast about 15% by weight of the total starch
content in the adhesive.The procedure employed in the production of corrugated paperboard usually
involves a continuous process whereby a strip of paperboard is first corrugated
by means of heated, fluted rolls. The protruding tips on one side of this fluted
paperboard strip are then coated with an adhesive, and a flat sheet of
paperboard, commonly known in the trade as a facing, is thereafter applied to
these tips. By applying heat and pressure to the two paperboard strips thus
brought together, an adhesive bond is formed between the strips. The above-described
procedure produces a single-faced board in that the facing is applied
to only one surface thereof. If a double-faced paperboard in which an inner
fluted layer sandwiched between two facings is desired, a second operation is
performed wherein the adhesive is applied to the exposed tips of the single-faced
board and the adhesive-coated tips are then pressed against a second facing in
the combining section of the corrugator under the influence of pressure and heat.
The typical corrugating process and the operation and use of corrugators in
general are described in US-A-2,051,025 and US-A-2,102,937.A major concern in such corrugating processes is the selection of the
appropriate adhesive, as its properties will affect not only the strength and
stability of the final corrugated product, but also the parameters, such as
corrugator speed, within which the process can be operated. Thus, such adhesives 
are chosen in light of the specific requirements of the process and the
properties desired in the ultimate corrugated paperboard. The adhesives most
commonly used in corrugating are starch-based adhesives which are popular because
of their desirable adhesive properties, low cost and ease of preparation.The most fundamental of starch corrugating adhesives is an alkaline
adhesive which is comprised of raw ungelatinized starch suspended in an aqueous
dispersion of cooked starch (carrier). The adhesive is produced by
