<ABSTRACT>
A momentary electrical switch (10) includes fixed 
contacts fixed relative to a switch housing (12) 

and slidable contacts located within the 
housing. A contact operating mechanism (21,16,52) 

incudes a manual control knob (21), a slide 
element (16) and a support (40) attached to the slide 

element for supporting the slidable contacts, 
the contact operating mechanism 

being movable axially in a first direction against the force 
of a compression spring (54) when the knob is 

pulled. The slide element moves within a casing (14) 
and carries an interlock element extendable beyond 

the periphery of the slide element to engage the casing 
to prevent movement of the contact operating mechanism 

when the knob is pulled. A 
spring biased interlock release stem (18) may be moved 

axially in a second direction, opposite to the first direction, 
by pressing on a pushbutton (19) to disengage the interlock 

element from the casing. The movable switch 
contacts may be moved in the first 

direction relative to the fixed contacts only by 
concurrently pressing in one direction on the pushbutton 

while pulling on the knob in the opposite 
direction. When the knob is released, the compression 

spring returns the contact operating mechanism 
and the movable contacts to 

their neutral position and when the pushbutton is 
released, the interlock element is again extended 

beyond the periphery of the slide element.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a momentary electrical
switch according to the preamble of claim 1, as for example known from US-A-4 282 414
and more particularly to a manually operated momentary
switch having a mechanical interlock which prevents turning the
switch on unless the operator concurrently operates an interlock
release mechanism and the mechanism which moves the switch
contacts.On agricultural tractors and off-road machinery it has been
conventional to provide manually actuated switches for
controlling energization of electrically controlled devices such
as, for example, a power take-off system. Conventionally, such
switches have been multi-stable, that is, they remain on when
switched to the on position and remain off when switched to the
off position. A switch of this type has a disadvantage in that,
if there should be a loss of power, it will cause re-energization
of the controlled device if the switch is in the on position when
power is restored.A further disadvantage occurs when multi-stable switches are
used in a computer-controlled system where the computer senses
the change of state rather than the state of the switch. In this
case the operator must remember to reset the switch, otherwise
its physical position will not correspond to the state recognized
by the computer.A problem with both multi-stable switches and momentary
switches of the prior art concerns safety. An operator may
inadvertently actuate the switch and, depending on the device
being controlled, this may create a hazardous condition.It is therefore an objective of the present invention to
provide a momentary switch which avoids the disadvantages of the
prior art and which cannot be moved unintentionally to an
actuated position.According to the present invention, a momentary electrical
switch is provided comprising : 
a switch housing;first contact means fixed relative to said switch housing;second contact means slidable relative to said first
contact means between at least a first position and a second
position;a casing mounted on said switch housing; andmanually operable contact operating means for moving said
second contact means between said at least first and second
positions, said contact operating means being slidably mounted in
said casing for movement along an axis in a first or a second
direction.The switch is characterized in that it further
comprises manually operable interlock means carried by said
contact operating means and cooperating with said casing to
prevent movement of said contact operating means
