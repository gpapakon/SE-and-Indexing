 MAGNETORESISTIVE HEAD WITH INTEGRATED BIAS AND MAGNETIC SHIELD LAYERBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the InventionThis invention relates to magnetic recording and playback heads and, in particular, to playback heads utilizing a magnetoresistive transducer element.2. Description of the Prior ArtMagnetoresistive (MR) playback heads are now well known in the art, having been perhaps first described in U.S. Patent No. 3,493,694 (Hunt), and subsequently improved and elaborated upon in a number of respects. Thus, for example, as described in U.S. Patent No. 3,881,190, magnetoresistive head constructions are now well known in which a bias field is provided by including a conductive layer adjacent to the magnetoresistive layer, current flowing through the conductive layer producing a magnetic field which biases the MR element to produce a more linear response. The ' 190 patent further discloses the desirability of sandwiching the MR element between magnetic shielding layers to enable the use of an extended throat height in the MR element, thus providing a structure useful for short wavelength recording. Numerous variants of such constructions have subsequently been disclosed. One such variant employs a ferrite as the substrate on which successive thin films of insulators, MR elements, bias conductors, additional shield layers, etc. , may be deposited, the ferrite shield thus intrinsically acting as a one shield element. It is also known to provide an additional MR layer functioning to carry a current to bias the operation of an adjacent MR layer. 

 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In contrast to such prior art constructions, the present invention is directed to a shielded MR head in which the functions of magnetically shielding and biasing the MR element are combined in at least a single layer. The head of the present invention is thus intended for interacting with information recorded at magnetized areas spaced along a recording medium.The head is a multiple layer, thin-film construction, and comprises a thin-film, magnetoresistive transducing element including at least a single layer of material exhibiting the magnetoresistive effect disposed between a pair of thin- film, magnetically-permeable members, at least one of which is also electrically conducting. The pair of magnetically permeable layers have opposing faces spaced apart a fixed distance on the order of, and less than, the shortest wavelength of . said recorded information. The edge of each of the two permeable layers closest to the medium lies in
