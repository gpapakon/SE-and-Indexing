<ABSTRACT>
Methods for packaging Metarhizium fungal cultures or conidia are described. In one embodiment, the fungal culture is provided within an insect infection chamber that attracts insects, then infects them with a lethal dosage of fungus, where the packaging maintains high humidity within the chamber, allows free exchange of gases, and is impermeable to microbes, including fungal spores, viruses, and bacteria. In a second embodiment, the fungal conidia are packaged under conditions which maintain high viability even after long-term storage at both 25  DEG C and 37  DEG C, i.e., low relative humidity and oxygen. The conidia can then be reactivated for the use in the control of insects such as cockroaches, flies, ants, soft-bodied insects, turf pests, and caterpillars.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD FOR STORING FUNGAL CULTURES AND CONIDIABackground of the InventionThe present invention relates to an improved means and methods of storage and reactivation of entomopathogenic fungal cultures and conidia, especially of the genera Metarhizium.There are many varieties of insects that cause major economic losses in agriculture and spread diseases among human and other animal populations. Currently, application of different chemical pesticides is the approache employed to control these insects. Unfortunately, pesticides are expensive and generally hazardous to the environment, particularly if effective for more than a very short term. Further, there is a tendency for pesticide-resistant strains of insects to develop, which requires the use of large quantities of pesticides, and re-treatment with different chemicals. The use of chemical insecticides also results in the destruction of non- target insects.Insect pathogens are an alternative to the common use of highly toxic chemical insecticides for the control of insect pests. Bacteria such as Bacillus thurigenesis are used with some success as a spray on plants susceptible to infestation with insects such as the gypsy moth. Fungi are another promising group of insect pathogens suitable for use as biological agents for the control of insects. The most common mode of growth and reproduction for fungi is vegetative or asexual reproduction which involves sporulation followed by germination of the spores. Asexual spores, including conidia, form at the tips and the sides of sporogenous cells on the hyphae, the branching filamentous structures of multicellular mycelium. In the proper environment, the conidia germinate, become enlarged,and produce germ tubes. The germ tubes develop, over time, into hyphae which 

in turn form mycelia. When the insect is inoculated via contact with the living propagules of the entomopathogenic fungi, the infection occurs as soon as the parasite relationship between the fungus and the target insect is established. With the development of infection, the fungus gradually kills the insect.U.S. Patent Nos. 5,057,316 and 5,057,315 disclose a method for control and extermination of insects, including roaches, flying insects such as the housefly, and other insects such as the adult form of the corn rootworm. The insects are controlled and exterminated by infection with a fungus that can be pathogenic when administered to the insects in a sufficiently high concentration, by means of an infection chamber. The chamber maintains the
