Fuel injection nozzle for internal combustion 
engines, especially for those with direct injection, 

having a nozzle body (10), in which an axial through hole 
with a guiding part (23) and, at the combustion-chamber 

end, a frustoconical valve seat (18) are formed, the 
annular edge between the guiding part (23) of the through 

hole and the valve seat (18) forming a control edge (52), 
having an outwardly opening, spring-loaded valve needle 

(15) which can be displaced with a guiding section (20) 
similar to a piston-type slide valve in the guiding part 

(23) of the nozzle body (10) and, at its end projecting 
beyond the valve seat (18), has a closing head (16) with 

a valve cone (17), the seating surface of which is 
axially congruent with the valve seat (18), the angle of 

taper (16) of the seating surface of the valve cone (17) 
differing slightly from that (c) of the valve seat (18), 

with the result that an annular sealing-seat line (53) is 
formed, and which guiding section (20), similar to a 

piston-type slide valve, of the valve needle (15) being 
covered by the guiding part (23) of the nozzle body (10) 

and having spray openings (30) which can be opened during 
the opening stroke by the control edge (52) of the same 

nozzle body as a function of the needle stroke and with 
the extension of which the slope of the valve cone (17) 

is aligned, characterized in that the control edge (52) 
takes the form of a sharp edge at the transition of the 

valve seat (18) to the cylindrical guiding section (23) 
of the nozzle body (10), in that the angle of taper (c) 

of the valve seat (18) on the nozzle body (10) is 
slightly greater than the angle of taper (b) of the valve  

 
cone (17) on the valve needle (15) and in that the 

radially inner boundary of the valve surface of the valve 
cone (17) is designed as a sharp annular edge (55), the 

diameter of which is slightly greater than the diameter 
of the control edge (51) on the nozzle body (10), with 

the result that the annular sealing-seat line (53) is 
formed immediately adjacent to the control edge (51). 
Fuel injection nozzle according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the valve cone (17) is formed on an 

annular body (60) which is fixed on the closing head (16) 
of the valve needle (15). 
Fuel injection nozzle according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that the annular body (60) is mounted on 

a cylindrical extension (62) of the guiding section (20) 
of the valve needle (15), the diameter of which is 

slightly greater than the diameter of the guiding section 
(20) of the valve needle (15). 
Fuel injection nozzle according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that the annular body (60) is fixed on 

the nozzle needle (15) by nonpositive engagement. 
Fuel injection nozzle according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that the annular body (60) is fixed on 

the nozzle needle (15) by positive engagement. 
Fuel injection nozzle according to one of Claims 
1 to 5, characterized in that the angle of taper (c) of 

the valve seat (18) on the nozzle body (10) is 2° to 10° 
greater than the angle of taper (b) of the valve cone 

(17) on the nozzle needle (15).
