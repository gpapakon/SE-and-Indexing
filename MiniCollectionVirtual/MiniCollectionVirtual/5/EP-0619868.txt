<ABSTRACT>
A system for supplying a device, such as the combustion chamber (5) of the barrel (1) of weapon using a liquid propellant, including a hydraulic cylinder consisting of a piston (15) and a cylinder (9) defining therewith a variable-volume chamber (16) connected to the combustion chamber (5) via an outlet channel (21), and a cushioning assembly (40) consisting of a projection (41) extending into the chamber (16), and a recess (42) formed in the piston (15) for cushioning said piston (15) at the end of its stroke by throttling the hydraulic fluid. An assembly (45) is provided for adjusting the length of the projection (41) within the chamber (16) according to its volume.

A system to supply a device with a volume of 
hydraulic liquid having a predetermined value which varies 

according to the operating conditions, this system 
comprising a hydraulic jack formed of a piston (15) and a 

cylinder (9) which marks out with the piston (15) a 
variable volume chamber (16) connected to the device, 

means to supply the chamber (16) with pressurized liquid, 
means to control the movement of the piston (15), such as 

a pressurized fluid introduced into a cylinder (9) on the 

opposite side of said chamber, and means (40) to cushion 
the movement of the piston (15) at the end of its stroke, 

the speed of the piston at the end of its stroke being 
variable and being determined by the initial axial length 

of the afore-mentioned chamber (16), the piston being 
braked and cushioned by a hydraulic rolling effect, 


characterised in that
 the means (40) to cushion the piston 
(15) at the end of its stroke comprise a rod or sprue 

(41) carried by the bottom of a cylinder (10) and 
projecting inside said chamber (16), and a cavity (42) of 

a corresponding shape and size, formed on the piston (15) 
and intended to accommodate the sprue (41) at the end of 

the piston (15) stroke, means (45) being provided in 
addition to adjust the length of the sprue (41) which 

projects into said chamber (16) according to the speed 
reached by the piston at the end of its stroke. 
A supply system according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the cylinder bottom (10), in whose 

direction the piston (15) moves, is axially mobile so as 
to adjust the volume of the chamber (16), and in that the 

means (45) to adjust the length of the sprue which 
projects into said chamber (16) also ensure the adjustment 

of the axial position of said cylinder bottom (10). 
A supply system according to Claim 2, 
characterised in that the afore-mentioned adjustment means 

(45) simultaneously ensure the movement of the sprue (41) 
and the cylinder bottom (10), so that the length of the  

 
sprue (41) projecting inside the chamber (16) increases 

when the volume of the chamber (16) increases. 
A supply system according to Claim 3, 
characterised in that the afore-mentioned adjustment means 

(45) ensure the movement of the sprue (41) and the 
cylinder bottom (10) in the same direction, but for 

different lengths of movement. 
A supply system according to Claim 2, 
characterised in that the cylinder bottom (10) is formed 

of a tubular element (10a) screwed into the body (6) of 
the jack, in that the sprue (41) of the cushioning means 

(40) is screwed inside said tubular element, the threading 
required to screw in the sprue (41) being tighter than 

those required to screw in the cylinder bottom (10), means 
(50) immobilizing said sprue (41) in rotation, and in that 

the adjustment means (45) comprise a control device to 
rotate the cylinder bottom (10). 
A supply system according to Claim 5, 
characterised in that the rotation control device 

comprises a sleeve (46) housed in the tubular element 
(10a), forming the cylinder bottom (10), and driven in 

rotation by a pinion (46a), a retainer (47) able to move 
in a groove (48) to link the sleeve (46) and the cylinder 

bottom (10) in rotation. 
A supply system according to Claim 6, 
characterised in that the means (50) to immobilize the 

sprue (41) in rotation are formed of a fixed tube (50) 
which has a rectangular section housed in the sleeve (46) 

and in which a rod (56) of a matching section and integral 
with the sprue (41) is mounted sliding.
