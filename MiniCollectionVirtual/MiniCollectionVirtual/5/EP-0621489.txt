<ABSTRACT>
A high-voltage gas-insulation screened electrical unit is equipped with a device for detecting partial discharges. It includes a reception means having a coiled receiving antenna (13) arranged near a slit (12) made in the metal casing (10) which is at low potential. An emitter means may be arranged facing the slit (12), this emitter means being excited by a potential difference generated by a high-impedance trap (choke) circuit (22) placed on the high-voltage conductor (11). This results in optimum sensitivity of the detection device.
