<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD FOR REMOVING HYDROFORMYIATION CATAI-YSTThe present invention relates generally to a method of removing dissolved cobalt compounds from the products of a cobalt catalyzed hydroformylation reaction. This method is particularly useful in removing dissolved cobalt from crude products formed from olefinic feedstocks having a carbon number in the range from about C to C14, preferably from about C5 to C7.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONHydroformylation reactions involve the preparation of oxygenated organic compounds by the reaction of carbon monoxide and hydrogen (a.k.a., syn or synthesis gas) with carbon compounds containing olefinic unsaturation. The reaction is performed in the presence of a carbonylation catalyst and results in the formation of a compound, for example an aldehyde, which has one more carbon atom in its molecular structure than the starting olefinic feedstock. By way of example, higher alcohols may be produced in the so- called "oxo" process by hydroformylation of commercial Cg-C*L2 olefin fractions to an aldehyde-containing oxonation product, which on hydrogenation yields respective C7-C13 saturated alcohols. The crude product of the hydroformylation reaction will contain catalyst, aldehydes, alcohols, unreacted feed, syn gas and by-products.Before further processing of the crude product is possible, it is necessary to remove the catalyst therefrom. One conventional method of removing cobalt values from such a crude product is to treat the 

product with an alkali or acid wash technique. See U.S. Patent No. 3,725,534 (Reisch) , which issued on April 3, 1973. However, this approach uses expensive raw materials and incurs problems associated with finally removing essentially all traces of cobalt from the water wash streams before being discharged.Another conventional method involves the oxidation of the cobalt catalytic species followed by extraction as a cobalt salt in aqueous solution. See U.S. Patent No. 2,744,921 (Mertzweiller et al.), which issued on May 8, 1956.U.S. Patent No. 4,625,067 (Hanin) , which issued on November 25, 1986, discloses still another method which involves the contacting of the crude product with a stream of stripping gas to entrain volatile cobalt compounds, characterized in that the contacting is performed in the presence of water and aqueous acid to dissolve those cobalt values not entrained in the gas under the conditions of temperature and pressure employed for the contacting, and the aqueous phase is subsequently separated from the organic hydroformylation
