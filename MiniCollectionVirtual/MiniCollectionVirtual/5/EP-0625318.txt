<ABSTRACT>
An improved helmet construction comprises an 
outer body (2), made of an injection molded or thermofored 

or rotatively molded or blown molded plastic material, 
adapted to provide a die member for making the 

helmet. 
On the inner surface of the outer body (2) there 
being applied layers (10) made of a glass-resin material 

or of composite materials forming the high strength 
structure of the helmet.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved 
helmet construction and to a meking method therefor. As is known,in order to make glass-resin 
or other layered plastic material helmets for motor-cyclists,car 
drivers for sport and work use there are 
generally used multiple moulds which must be fitted to 
several different size helmets on which there are 
applied multiple overlying layers of a glass-resin 
material or composite materials such as kevlar,carbon 
fibres and/or reinforcement material of different 
types. After a curing step,the helmet is removed 
from the mould and is subjected to finishing operations 
of smoothing the outer surface thereof and preparing 
its bottom. In addition,it is also necessary to trim 
it in order to precisely define the edge portions of 
the helmet. In the prior helmet making methods,accordingly,  
 
it is necessary to provide a comparatively great 
number of moulds,also considering the fact that,for 
each helmet size,one must use a proper size mould;in 
this connection it should moreover be pointed out that 
the moulds must be moreover subjected to specific 
processing operations carried out in order to cause 
a proper releasing or detaching of the helmets from 
the moulds. A further drawback derives furthermore from 
the fact that the above mentioned smoothing operation 
on the outer surface of the helmet must be carried 
out with a high skillness in order to remove possible 
valleys and ridges therefrom. Finally,yet another drawback is that the 
above mentioned prior helmet making methods are 
comparatively long,require a lot of moulds,with the 
related making costs,thereby it is necessary to use 
techniques and materials providing a quick curing of 
the made article in order to at least partially reduce 
the number of the moulds which are necessary for the 
several processing steps. Attempts which have been made for making  
 
helmets by injecting plastic material,either of a 
thermoset or of a thermoplastic type,have not been found 
to be satisfactory,since a helmet construction is 
obtained which has a very poor impact strength. Accordingly,the aim of the present invention 
is to overcome the above mentioned drawbacks,by providing 
a helmet construction which can be made by a 
construction method very different from the above mentioned 
prior methods,and,in particular without the need 
of using a lot of moulds or performing a lot of 
operations for releasing the helmet from the mould and 
processing the mould itself. Within the scope of the above mentioned 
aim,a

<CLAIMS>
An improved helmet construction comprising an 
outer body,made of a plastic material,molded by an 

injection molding method or a thermoforming molding 
method or a rotary molding method or a blowing molding 

method,so as to provide a die member for making said 
helmet construction,on an inner surface of said outer 

body there being applied layers made of a glass-resin 
material or composite materials forming a high mechanical 

resistance structure of said helmet construction. 
A helmet construction,according to claim 1,wherein 
said helmet construction further comprises,on a surface 

of said outer body,a paint coating. 
A helmet construction,according to claim 1,wherein 
said glass-resin or composite material layers form 

a single body with said outer body. 
A method for making an improved helmet construction 
according to claim 1,wherein said method comprises the 

 
steps of making,by molding a plastic material,an outer 

body,applying on an inner surface of said outer body 
a plurality of layers made of a glass-resin material or 

composite materials,including a curing material therein, 
applying a paint outer coating and,finally,covering the 

glass-resin or composite material layers with a padding 
layer.
