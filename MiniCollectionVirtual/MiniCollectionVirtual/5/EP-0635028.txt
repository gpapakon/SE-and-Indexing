<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel polypeptides and the use of these
peptides in the preparation of formulations for the treatment of
respiratory disease.The present invention relates to novel compositions of matter and
methods for the treatment of respiratory distress with these novel
compositions. This invention also relates to the use of polypeptides
(protein fragments) which enhance the surfactant-like properties of
phospholipids. More specifically, the present invention relates to novel
polypeptides comprising analogs of fragment replicas
of the naturally occurring low molecular weight hydrophobic surfactant
associated protein known as SP-B and to their use in the formulation of
novel medicaments useful in the establishment, modification and/or
maintenance of pulmonary surface tension.For purposes of establishing the background of the present
invention, reference is made to the teachings
and disclosures of the following U.S. Patent Applications:
1. U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 860,239, filed May 6, 1986 (EP-A-0273916);2. U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 060,719, filed June 10, 1987 (WO
88/04324);3. U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 101,680, filed October 1, 1987 (EP-A-290516);4. U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 175,741, filed March 31, 1988 (EP-A-
290516);5. U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 897,183, filed August 15, 1986 (EP-A-
335133);6. U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 397,151, filed August 22, 1989 (EP-A-
240550).EP-A-458 167, WO-A-88 03170 and S.D. Revak et al., Pediatr. Res.
(1991), 29(5), 460-5, disclose the use of SP-B (53-78) in combination with
phospholipids as pulmonary surfactants.Also worthy of mention is U.S. 4,659,805 which discloses and claims a
high molecular weight surfactant protein known as SP-A. These references disclose the discovery, method of isolation,
characterization and use of a family of naturally occurring mammalian
surfactant-associated proteins. Members of this family have been
designated as SP-A, SP-B and SP-C. These proteins are known to have the
capacity to affect the surfactant-like activity of both natural and
synthetic phospholipids. It should be noted that the associated
scientific literature also uses the nomenclature of SAP-B, SAP-(Phe),
SAP-6 (Phe), and SPL-(Phe) for SP-B. SP-C is also referred to as SAP-C,
SAP-(Val), SAP-6 (Val) and SPL (Val) in the prior art. These two proteins
(SP-8 and SP-C) are distinct gene products with unique amino acid
sequences. Both proteins are derived from proteolytic processing of
larger precursor proteins
