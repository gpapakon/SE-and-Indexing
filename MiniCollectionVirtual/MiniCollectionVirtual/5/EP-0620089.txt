<ABSTRACT>
The isostatic die for pressing items, in particular 
ceramic tiles, makes for greater uniformity of pressing by 

compensating for differences of density occurring when 
loading the matrix with the powders to be pressed; said 

die consists of an elastic membrane (5), delimiting 
externally a cavity in the punch or in the matrix, the 

membrane being connected to elements (1; 3; 18; 103a; 111; 
128; 129; 208; 316) for controlling deformation, among 

which is a plate (18; 111) attached in a predetermined way 

to the membrane (5) and/or to the cavity of the matrix 
and/or of the punch; its use is foreseen in 

establishments for the manufacture of ceramic items.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns die means, suitable for isostatic 
moulding ceramic tiles, according to the preamble of 
claim 1. IT-A-1104511, by the same applicant relates to a method 
and a device for achieving uniform pressing of ceramic 
tiles. The method envisages the application to the free surface 
of the clay mixture introduced into the opening of the 
die, during the action of pressing of an elastic moulding 
surface, or elastic membrane, held in firm contact with 
the clay mixture, to form one face of the tile, by means 
of an incompressible fluid: this, to neutralize the 
effects of zones of disuniform density in the body of the 
formed tile which would cause uneven shrinkage on firing, 
with consequent variations in the size, or linearity, of 
the sides of the tile and/or of the planarity of its 
surface and with the additional possibility of cracking 
or breakage. The methods and the device according to that particular 
prior art document have introduced the fundamental 
concept of an incompressible fluid, for example, oil, 
acting on an elastic membrane and interposed between the 
punch and the membrane. However, said method and device do not always enable 
sufficiently flat (back) surfaces, and hence sufficiently 
uniform tile thickness, to be readily achieved, 
particularly in the case of large formats: We are aware of a die, 
featuring an auxiliary punch base 
with, on its front face, a chessboard-like array of large 
flat squares surrounded by channels for the 
distribution of the liquid, communicating with the 
internal surface of the overlying membrane by means 
of large, corresponding square alveoli, forming part 
of an intermediate punch-plate superimposed on said 
auxiliary punch base. The smooth inner surface of the 
overlying (vulcanized) membrane is moulded to afford 
an array of large, flat square protruding bosses 
surrounded by channels corresponding exactly to the 
aforesaid configuration of the upper face of said base of 
auxiliary punch.  
 However this punch is of extremely complex construction; 
furthermore, the considerable size of the square alveoli 
causes a notable deformation of the membrane with 
consequent unacceptable defects of planarity in the 
pressed tile. This type of mould is also described as 
forming part of the prior art in IT-U-MI93000071, Fig. 1 
and in IT-A-MI92002158, page 3. EP-A-0556163, which is per se an intermediate document 
but concerns the same type of mould, discloses a mould 
having a plurality of cavities defined by a lattice to 
which a membrane
