<ABSTRACT>
A connector for joining flexible tubing for medical purposes comprises a first coupling member (1) in which there is mounted a hollow mandrel (3), which has passage openings (4, 5) for connection of a first piece of tubing and opens in a second coupling member (15) releasably connected to the first coupling member (1), the second coupling member (15) having at least two connection openings (17, 18) and a displaceable closure piece. In this connector, the connection openings (17, 18) of the second coupling member (15) are offset in the axial direction, the closure piece (19) having at least one recess or perforation which connects the two connection openings (17, 18) of the second coupling member (15) in a first displacement position of the closure piece (19) and separates them from one another in a second displacement position, a connection opening (18) of the second coupling member (15) being in open connection with the hollow mandrel (3) of the first coupling member (1) in the second displacement position of the closure piece (19).
