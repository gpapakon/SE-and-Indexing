<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition for use in the treatment of pain and inflammation and the treatment of acid indigestion, sour stomach, heartburn and symptoms of upset stomach associated with these conditions in a mammalian organism, said composition comprising: (i) an analgesically and anti-inflammatory effective amount of (S)-ibuprofen, or a salt thereof, substantially free of (R)-ibuprofen; (ii) an amount effective in the treatment of acid indigestion, sour stomach and/or heartburn of at least one of the antacids; and (iii) optionally, an amount effective in treating excess gas and flatulence of an anti-gas agent.

<DESCRIPTION>
TITLE OF THE INVENTION IBUPROFEN-ANTACID COMBINATIONSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs(NSAID) have been utilized in the treatment of pain/ inflammation and have been disclosed as useful in the treatment, management and mitigation of cold symptoms and the pain associated therewith. Ibuprofen (2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propionic acid) is a well known and commonly employed NSAID. Recently, it has been found that a faster onset of pain relief and an enhanced analgesic response can be obtained by the utilization of the single enantiomer (S)-ibuprofen in comparison to racemic ibuprofen, (see for example T . S. Patent 4,877,620).SUBSTITUTE SHEET 

 Antacids are useful for the treatment of acid indigestion, heartburn, sour stomach, and symptoms of upset stomach associated with these conditions. Antacids work by neutralizing the excess stomach acid, thereby preventing inflammation, relieving pain, and allowing the mucous layer and lining to mend. In optional combination with an anti-gas agent, such as simethicone, antacids may offer relief or reduction of flatuence. Anti-gas remedies have a defoaming action that relieves or reduces flatulence by dispersing and preventing the formation of mucous-surrounded gas pockets in the gastrointestinal tract. Additionally, products which are combined with alginates float on the contents of the stomach and produce a neutralizing layer to subdue acid that can rise into the esophagus, causing â€¢ heartburn.Combinations of ibuprofen with antacid have not been disclosed, however, despite the fact that the acid indigestion, heartburn, sour stomach and upset stomach symptom sufferer is in need of quick and enhanced relief. Further, there has been no consideration has been given to the employment of (S)-ibuprofen, and more particularly a lysine or arginine salt thereof, in combination with an antacid for the treatment of acid indigestion, heartburn, sour stomach and symptoms of upset stomach associated with these conditions. 

 DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition for use in the treatment of pain and inflammation and the treatment of acid indigestion, _ heartburn, sour stomach and symptoms of upset stomach associated with these conditions, in a mammalian organism, said composition comprising:(i) an analgesically and anti-inflammatory effective amount of (S)-ibuprofen, or a salt thereof, .- substantially free of (R)-ibuprofen; and(ii) an amount effective in the treatment of acid indigestion,

<CLAIMS>
WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. A pharmaceutical composition for use in the treatment of pain and inflammation and the treatment of acid indigestion, heartburn, sour stomach and symptoms of upset stomach associated with these conditions in a mammalian organism and adapted for unit dosage oral administration, said composition comprising:
(i) an analgesically and anti-inflammatory effective amount of a salt of (S)-ibuprofen substantially free of (R)-ibuprofen wherein the salt is selected from (S)-ibuprofen-(S)-lysine and (S)-ibuprofen-(R)-lysine; and
(ii) an amount effective in the treatment of acid indigestion, heartburn, sour stomach and symptoms of upset stomach associated with these conditions of at least one antacid.
2. The composition according to Claim 1 comprising at least 50 mg of the salt of (S)-ibuprofen.
3. The composition according to Claim 1 wherein the antacid is selected from aluminum hydroxide, aluminum hydroxide with magnesium carbonate, aluminum hydroxide with magnesium hydroxide, calcium carbonate, magnesium hydroxide, magnesium oxide or magnesium trisilicate. 


 4. The composition according to Claim 3 wherein the antacid is aluminum hydroxide with magnesium hydroxide.
5. The composition according to Claim 3 wherein the antacid is aluminum hydroxide with magnesium hydroxide in a ratio of 1:1.
6. A method of treating pain and inflammation and the treatment of acid indigestion, heartburn, sour stomach and symptoms of upset stomach associated with these conditions in a mammalian organism in need of such treatment, comprising administering to such organism: (i) an analgesically and anti-inflammatory effective amount of (S)-ibuprofen, or a salt-thereof, substantially free of (R)-ibuprofen;
(ii) an amount effective in the treatment of acid indigestion, heartburn, sour stomach and symptoms of upset stomach associated with these conditions of at least one antacid.
7. A method of eliciting an onset hastened and enhanced response for the treatment of pain and inflammation and the treatment of acid indigestion, heartburn, sour stomach and symptoms of upset stomach associated with these conditions in a mammaliam organism in need of such treatment, comprising administering to such organism. (i) an analgesically and anti-inflammatory effective amount of (S)-ibuprofen, or a salt thereof, substantially free of (R)-ibuprofen; and 


 (ii) an amount effective in the treatment of acid indigestion, heartburn, sour stomach and symptoms of upset stomach associated with these conditions of at least one antacid.
8. A method of reducing the side effects associated with the administration of an ibuprofen/antacid combination which comprises the aministration of (S)-ibuprofen, or a salt thereof, substantially free of (R)-ibuprofen, and at least one antacid.
9. A method of reducing the size and weight of an ibuprofen/antacid combination dosage form which comprises combining (S)-ibuprofen, or salt thereof, substantially free of (R)-ibuprofen and at least one antacid.
