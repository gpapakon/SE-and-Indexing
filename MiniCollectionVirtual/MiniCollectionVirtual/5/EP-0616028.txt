<ABSTRACT>
The present compositions comprise short chain alkoxylated alcohols as 
nonionic surfactants. The short chain alkoxylated alcohols provide 

superior cleaning compared to their homologues with longer chains as 
well as other benefits including, low foaming and skin mildness, and the 

ability to formulate concentrated compositions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to cleaning compositions. 
Although the present invention applies primarily to hard 
surface cleaning compositions, it may also be of interest 
for other cleaning compositions including dishwashing and 
laundry detergent compositions. A variety of cleaning compositions have been described in 
the art. There is a constant strive for the development of 
cleaning compositions with better performance in several 
respects. Better cleaning on all soils, including greasy 
soils and soap scum is of course a principal object, both 
for neat and diluted compositions which are often used in  
 
the cleaning of hard surfaces. However other properties 
are also highly desirable, particularly mildness to the 
skin, the ability to remove soap scum and to produce 
limited suds. All such objects can be independently achieved by using 
various ingredients which are generally added for a 
specific purpose. For instance silicone oils are typically 
added solely to control sudsing. Another example is the 
use of solvents to boost neat cleaning. While such 
additives meet the desired object, they also grief the cost 
of formulating efficient cleaning compositions. It has now been found that certain nonionic surfactants, 
namely alkoxylated alcohols with a short alkyl chain in the 
alcohol, hereinafter short chain alkoxylated alcohols, meet 
the above objects. Indeed, it has been found that said 
short chain alkoxylated alcohols are particularly efficient 
in cleaning. Such short chain alkoxylated alcohols further 
meet the other objects of providing surfactants which are 
low foaming and which are mild to the skin. Another 
advantage is that such short chain alkoxylated alcohols are 
particularly suitable for formulating concentrated cleaning 
compositions. EP 125 854 discloses a composition comprising 2.7% of 
C8EO4.8 together with 14.2% of ammonium C11.8 linear alkyl 
benzene sulphonate, 10.4 of ammonium C12-13 alkyl 
ethoxylated sulphate, 8.6% magnesium C12-13 alkyl sulphate, 
4.0% coconut monoethanolamide and 9.1% ethanol and water. 
EP 125 854 however fails to draw the difference between 
long and short chain nonionic surfactants. EP 496 188 discloses an aqueous solution comprising 3% of 
C8EO6 and 8% maleic acid. EP 486 188 does not draw the 
difference between long and short chain nonionic 
surfactants.  The present invention encompasses aqueous cleaning 
compositions comprising a short chain alkoxylated alcohol 
surfactant according to the formula RO(A)nH, wherein R is a 
C6 to C10
