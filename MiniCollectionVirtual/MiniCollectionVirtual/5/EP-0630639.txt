<ABSTRACT>
Dental ceramic restoration having a multilayer structure on a core, obtainable by applying an opaque layer of the composition 50 to 60% by weight of SiO2, 4 to 10% by weight of Na2O, 0 to 2.5% by weight of CaO, 8 to 14% by weight of K2O, 10 to 20% by weight of Al2O3, 0 to 6% by weight of B2O3, 5 to 12% by weight of TiO2 and pigments, preferably oxide-based, onto a core, followed by firing of this arrangement, then application of a dentine/enamel layer of the composition 50 to 60% by weight of SiO2, 4 to 10% by weight of Na2O, 0 to 2.5% by weight of CaO, 8 to 14% by weight of K2O, 10 to 20% by weight of Al2O3, 2 to 10% by weight of B2O3, in particular 4 to 8% by weight of B2O3, and pigments, preferably oxide-based, followed by firing of the arrangement.
