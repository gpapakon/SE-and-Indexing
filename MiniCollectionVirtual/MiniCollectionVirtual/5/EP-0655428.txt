<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a machine for turning over compost heaps, with a rotating turning-over roller, arranged transversely to the direction of travel, for picking up and throwing up the compost. In order to reach the basic layer of compost on the ground which cannot be grasped by the turning-over roller, there is arranged pivotably behind the turning-over roller, as seen in the direction of travel, and over the entire length of the latter a shield, via which compost which has remained lying on the ground can be pushed together and guided onto the turning-over roller.

Machine for turning over compost heaps lying on 
the ground 


having a rotating turning-over roller (16), which is 
arranged transversely to the direction of travel, for 

lifting up the compost, a blade (28) being arranged 
behind the turning-over roller, as seen in the direction 

of travel (a), running over the length of the turning-over 
roller,
 
characterized 
in that the blade (28) is mounted pivotably in such a 
manner that a free end of the blade (28) drags along the 

ground, with the result that compost which has remained 
lying on the ground can be pushed together and collected 

by the turning-over roller (16), 
in that the blade (28) is divided at least once over its 
length and in that each blade segment (28', 28'', 28''') 

is mounted so that it can be pivoted independently. 
Machine according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the blade (28) is directed at an acute angle to the 

ground. 
Machine according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the blade is arranged pivotably in a frame (26), 

and in that the frame (26) has at least one stop (34) 
which limits the pivoting movement of the blade (28) 

towards the ground. 
Machine according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the blade (28) has springs which 

exert a load in order to increase the bearing pressure. 
Machine according to one of Claims 1 to 4,  
 

characterized in that the blade (28) is covered at the 
sides by protective plates (30). 
Machine according to Claim 5, characterized in 
that the protective plates (30) are each mounted such 

that they can pivot about an axis which lies in front of 
the turning-over roller (16), as seen in the direction of 

travel. 
Machine according to Claim 5, characterized in 
that the protective plates (30) are suspended pivotably 

in the frame (26). 
Use of the machine according to one of Claims 1 
to 7 for the lateral movement of compost heaps lying on 

the ground.
