<ABSTRACT>
In elemental analysis of material samples by means of spectrometric analysis of the plasma in a low-pressure gas discharge supported by a RF current, problems arise in the prior art in energy transmission and faults in the power measurement used. With the novel solution, direct and accurate power measurement is intended to be made possible, it being intended to avoid an energy-transfer line with standardised impedance and to guarantee a reliable RF current supply.   According to the invention, the RF voltage is measured across the gas-discharge gap and, in the circuit supplying the gas discharge, the RF current is simultaneously measured in-phase. The resulting values of the active power and/or frequency and the value of the DC voltage component are used for controlling the RF current-supply unit and/or quantifying elemental-analysis values. Accordingly, a voltmeter (2) is connected in parallel to the low-pressure gas-discharge source (2) and an ammeter (6) is connected in the circuit supplying the gas discharge. The outputs of the measuring instruments are connected to a unit (8) for processing measured values, which unit is connected on the output side to the RF current-supply unit (1) and/or is coupled to a data-processing device. Field of application is elemental analysis of electrically conductive and non-conductive material samples.
