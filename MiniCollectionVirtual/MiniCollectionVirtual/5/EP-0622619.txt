<ABSTRACT>
A photodetector (22) includes a polarizer array (38) and an array of 
photodetector elements (36). The polarizer array (38) includes 

a plurality of 
polarizers (38a-c) having axes of polarization spaced apart by 

selected angles 
such that each optical signal incident on the polarizer array (38) has a 

polarization component along at least one of the axes of polarization. 
The array of photodetector elements (36) is arranged 

such that each of the 
photodetector elements (36a-c) receives light from a selected one of the 

polarizers (38a-c). At least one of the photodetector elements 
receives parallel 

polarization components from the optical signals to form an electrical 
signal indicative of interference between the optical signals.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to fiber optic acoustic sensors
and particularly to fiber optic acoustic sensors for underwater use. Still
more particularly, this invention relates to apparatus and methods for
preventing polarization signal fading in a fiber optic interferometric
sensor used as a hydrophone.A single mode optical fiber is capable of guiding signals of two
linear polarizations. In a fiber optic hydrophone comprised of fiber
optic interferometric sensors, the output signal may be a function of the
polarization of the optical signals guided by the optical fibers in the
sensors. Generally the maximum signal is obtained if the two fibers
guide signals of the same polarization state.A major problem of fiber optic interferometric sensors is loss of
signal due to signal fading caused by changes in the polarization of the
waves guided by the fibers. Drift in the relative optical path length
difference in the interferometer arms causes a change in the relative
state of polarization of the two interferometer arms. This may also be
viewed as a change in the interference phase, which changes the signal
intensity. Complete polarization fading occurs when the polarizations
are orthogonal. In prior art systems, polarization signal fading may
degrade the signal intensity to the point that no usable information is
available.Polarization fading and strumming noise have been observed
regularly in sea trials of fiber optic towed hydrophone arrays.
Polarization fading in such hydrophone arrays occurs when the two
fibers that comprise the hydrophone have orthogonal polarization
components. Polarization fading may reduce the fringe visibility in the
output of interferometric sensors to zero. All hydrophone signal
information then disappears. A fiber optic polarization controller has been used to overcome
the problem of polarization signal fading. This polarization controller
has a plurality of loops of the optical fiber wound on spools whose
edges are mounted on a common axis. The axis lies in the plane of
each coil. Adjusting the angles of the loops of optical fiber adjusts the
polarization state of the optical signal guided by the fiber.Birefringence can be induced in a single mode optical fiber by
bending the fiber into a coil. Bending an optical fiber causes an
increase in the material density in the place perpendicular to the plane
of the coil, which increases the refractive index in that plane. Changes
in the refractive index in the plane of the coil are negligible due to the
opposite effect of

interference between the optical signals, characterised by:

a polarizer array (38A, 38B, 38C) arranged to receive the

polarization of at least one of the polarizers;
an array of photoelectric elements (37A, 37A, 37C) arranged to
correspond to the polarizers such that each of the photoelectric
