<ABSTRACT>
A probe head (10) includes a support (12) by which the 
probe head is retained on the quill of a coordinate 

positioning machine, and a rotor (14) which is magnetically 
retained on the support (12). The rotor (14) is rotatable 

between a plurality of indexed angular positions provided 
by a ring of balls (26) and three adjacently positioned 

pairs of rollers (24). A drive dog shaft (20) is linearly 
movable to disengage the balls (26) from the rollers (24), 

and rotatable to rotate the rotor (14) to a new indexed 
position, whereupon the drive dog shaft (20) is retracted 

to re-engage a set of three balls (26) with the rollers 
(24). Exchange of a measuring probe (16) is performed by 

removing the entire rotor (14), and exchanging it for a 
further rotor carrying a different measuring probe. The 

engagement elements provided by rollers (24) and balls (26) 
thus serve the functions of (a) indexing and (b) repeatably 

retaining a rotor (14) on the support (12). This reduces 
the number of kinematic locations required between the 

movable arm of the machine and the probe (16) during the 
course of normal operation of a probe head to which a 

number of probes (16) are releasably couplable.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a probe head used on a 
coordinate positioning machine to orient a touch trigger 
probe (for example) relative to the movable arm (or quill) 
of the machine. The coordinate positioning machine may 
e.g. be either a coordinate measuring machine or a machine 
tool. It is known (from "Probing for Productivity on Coordinate 
Measuring Machines" RENISHAW) to provide a two-axis 
motorised probe head for orienting a probe relative to the 
quill of a machine with two degrees of rotational freedom. 
Such a probe head comprises a support, which is connectable 
to the quill of a machine, and a pair of serially mounted 
rotors, each of which is engageable in, and may rotate 
between a plurality of indexed positions. A probe is 
connected to the "free" rotor, and is oriented relative to 
the quill by rotation of one or both of the rotors about 
their respective axes. Indexing of position between two 
relatively rotating parts is provided by a ring of balls on 
one of the parts, and three seating members on the other 
part, each of which seats in the convergent surfaces 
provided by an adjacent pair of balls. Thus, at each of 
the indexed positions each rotor is kinematically 
supported; this provides maximum positional repeatability 
of the probe at each indexed position. An inventive concept claimed in the parent to the present 
application relates to a system for interchanging a number 
of probes upon an indexing probe head of the type described 
above, in which each of the probes to be supported on the 
probe head is mounted to a carrying member which, in use, 
forms the rotor of the probe head. More particularly, the parent application provided a probe 
head for orienting a probe relative to the movable arm of a 
coordinate positioning machine, comprising:  
 
a support by which the probe head is connectable to the 
arm of the machine; a rotor for carrying a probe; retaining means for releasably retaining the rotor on 
the support, to enable one rotor to be exchanged for 
another; indexing means for providing a plurality of indexed 
angular positions of the rotor relative to the support, 
comprising a first set of engagement elements provided on 
one of the rotor and support, and a plurality of sets of 
second engagement elements provided on the other of the 
rotor and support, said first set of engagement elements 
being engageable with each set of said plurality of sets of 
second engagement elements to provide, at each indexed 
position, a stable, repeatable rest position of
