<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to device processing, packaging and interconnects that will yield integrated electronic circuitry of higher density and complexity than can be obtained by using conventional multi-chip modules. Processes include the formation of complex multi-function circuitry on common module substrates using circuit tiles of silicon thin-films which are transferred, interconnected and packaged. Circuit modules using integrated transfer/interconnect processes compatible with extremely high density and complexity provide large-area active-matrix displays with on-board drivers and logic in a complete glass-based modules. Other applications are contemplated, such as, displays, microprocessor and memory devices, and communication circuits with optical input and output.

<DESCRIPTION>
The development of new portable electronic products,
such as the laptop computer, is currently of great
worldwide interest. Miniaturization of the various
component systems (memories, displays, and so forth) for
such products requires that the necessary circuits be
packed in as small a volume as possible. Packing circuits
into a small volume also reduces parasitic capacitance and
improves signal propagation time between circuits. One
approach to this requirement is to increase the scale of
integration in order to obtain all of the required
functions from a circuit made from a single wafer.
Unfortunately, efforts to create full-wafer circuitry have
encountered unacceptable yield losses owing to the large
circuit size. In the specific area of active matrix
displays, a similar problem results in attempting the
scale-up of the display size to and beyond the 256K pixel
level.Active matrix (AM) displays generally consist of
flat-panels consisting of liquid crystals or
electroluminescent materials which are switched "on" and
"off" by electric fields emanating from pixel electrodes
charged by thin-film transistors (TFT's) co-located with
each liquid crystal or electroluminescent pixel area.
These AM displays are expected to supplant cathode ray
tube (CRT) technology and provide a more highly defined
television picture or data display. The primary advantage
of the active matrix approach, using TFT's, is the
elimination of cross-talk between pixels, and the
excellent grey scale that can be attained with TFT-compatible
liquid crystal displays (LCD's).Flat panel displays employing LCD's generally include
five different layers: a white light source layer, a 
first polarizing filter layer that is mounted on one side
of a circuit panel on which the TFT's are arrayed to form
pixels, a filter plate layer containing at least three
primary colors arranged into pixels, and finally a second
polarizing filter layer. A volume between the circuit
panel and the filter plate is filled with a liquid crystal
material. This material rotates the polarization of light
passing through it when an appropriate electric field is
applied across it. Thus, when a particular pixel
electrode of the display is charged up by an associated
TFT, the liquid crystal material rotates polarized light
being transmitted through the material so that it will
pass through the second polarizing filter and be seen by
the viewer.The primary approach to TFT formation over the large
areas required for flat panel displays has involved the
use of films of
