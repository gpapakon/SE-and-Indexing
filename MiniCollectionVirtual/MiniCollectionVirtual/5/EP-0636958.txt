<ABSTRACT>
A method and an apparatus for controlling the motors for 
moving a tool, comprising a control cycle with the steps 

of calculating first and second parameters indicating the 
speed to be imparted to the motors to travel at a 

pre-established nominal speed along first and second 
segments sequential to each other, and of calculating the 

absolute value of the difference between first and second 
parameters. If the difference is less than a 

pre-established maximum value, the motors are commanded to 
travel along the first segment at the pre-established 

nominal speed and are then commanded to travel along the 
second segment at the pre-established nominal speed. If 

the difference is greater than the maximum value, the 
motors are commanded to travel along the first segment at 

the pre-established nominal speed until they almost reach 
the end of the first segment, and then slow down to a 

pre-established minimum speed, reach the point of 
conjunction between the two segments at said minimum speed 

and then accelerate again to follow the second segment and 
travelalong it at the nominal speed pre-established for 

it.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention refers to an innovative method of control 
for a numerical control machining apparatus, for example 
of the type with three cartesian axes described in the 
Italian patent application MI92A000491 on behalf of the 
same Applicant. The problems caused by sudden sharp changes of direction 
in automatic precision control mechanisms, such as 
numerical control machining apparatuses, are well known. Inertia of the masses in movement prevents excessively 
sharp changes due both to the considerable stress 
transmitted to the mechanical parts and to the possible 
loss of control of the movement. For example, as is well-known to the expert, stepper 
motors are often advantageously used in similar 
applications, thanks to the low cost of the necessary 
electronic control equipment and to its intrinsic 
characteristics. Conversely, these motors cannot be 
subjected to sharp changes in the speed of rotation, or of 
the control pulse period. In fact, an excessively rapid 
change gives rise to an inevitable loss of pitch, that is 
to say, the angular position assumed by the motor becomes 
indistinct, with obvious consequences as regards the 
accuracy of the controlled movement. Especially in cartesian-axis machining apparatuses, such 
as the one described in the aforementioned application,  
 
each change of direction of the tool is a potential source 
of problems, due to the fact that each movement in the 
cartesian space is made up of a combination of movements 
along the three cartesian axes, each of which is 
controlled by its respective motor. Sharp-cornered points along the path of movement therefore 
give rise to sharp changes in the speed ratios between the 
three motors. The problem is usually avoided by slowing 
down the motors along pre-established ramps, in the 
vicinity of each change of path of the tool, for example 
until they come to a standstill, and then gradually 
re-accelerate to the normal machining speed after having 
passed the point of change of direction, thereby ensuring 
that the changes in speed of the individual motors remain 
within a given safety limit. This method of proceeding however results in a slow down 
of the production process, since the average speed of 
movement of the tool depends upon the number of changes in 
direction. Moreover, it has been observed that in 
machining operations on materials such as wood, the speed 
of movement of the tool is an extremely important 
parameter for the surface finish of the area subjected to 
the action of the tool itself.

<CLAIMS>
A method of controlling motors for moving a tool along 
a pre-established path which comprises a plurality of path 

segments sequential to one another, comprising a control 
cycle with the steps of: 


calculating first parameters indicating the speed to be 
imparted to the motors to travel at a pre-established 

nominal speed along a first segment of a sequential pair 
of path segments, 
calculating second parameters indicating the speed to be 
imparted to the motors to travel at a pre-established 

nominal speed along a second segment of the sequential 
pair of path segments, 
calculating the absolute value of the difference between 
the first and second parameters and ascertain whether said 

difference is higher than a pre-established maximum value, 
if the difference is less than the pre-established 
maximum value: commanding the motors to travel along the 

first segment at the nominal speed pre-established for it 
and then, from the point of conjunction between the two 

segments, commanding the motors to travel along the second 
segment at the nominal speed pre-established for it, 
if the difference is greater than the maximum value: 
commanding the motors to travel along the first segment at 

the nominal speed pre-established for it, slowing down the 
speed of the motors close to the end of the first segment 

to a pre-established minimum speed, reaching the point of 
 

conjunction between the two segments at such minimum speed 
and then accelerating the motors again to travel along the 

second segment at the nominal speed pre-established for 
it.

second parameters comprise magnitudes Proportional to the 

speed vectors of the motors along at least two artesian

Method as claimed in claim 1, comprising the first

being smaller than said maximum value, close to the end of 
 

the first segment slowing down the speed of the motors to 
a pre-established minimum speed to reach the point of 

conjunction between the two segments at said minimum speed 
and then accelerate the motors again to travel along the 

second segment.
