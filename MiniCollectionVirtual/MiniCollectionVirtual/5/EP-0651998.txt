<DESCRIPTION>
The mechanism of bone loss is not completely 
understood, but in practical effect, the disorder arises 
from an imbalance in the formation of new healthy bone and 
the resorption of old bone, skewed toward a net loss of 
bone tissue. This bone loss includes a decrease in both 
mineral content and protein matrix components of the bone, 
and leads to an increased fracture rate of, predominantly, 
femoral bones and bones in the forearm and vertebrae. 
These fractures, in turn, lead to an increase in general 
morbidity, a marked loss of stature and mobility, and, in 
many cases, an increase in mortality resulting from 
complications. Bone loss occurs in a wide range of subjects, 
including post-memopausal women, patients who have 
undergone hysterectomy, patients who are undergoing or have 
undergone long-term administration of corticosteroids, 
patients suffering from Cushing's syndrome, and patients 
having gonadal dysgenesis. The need for bone repair or 
replacement also arises locally in the case of bone 
fracture, non-union, defect, prosthesis implantation, and 
the like. Further, such need also arises in cases of 
systemic bone diseases, as in osteoporosis, 
osteroarthritis, Paget's disease, osteomalacia, 
osteohalisteresis, multiple myeloma and other forms of 
cancer and the like. The current invention provides methods for 
inhibiting the loss of bone. This invention provides methods for the 
inhibition of bone loss, comprising administering to a 
human in need of treatment an effective amount of a 
compound of formula I     wherein R is hydrogen; hydroxy; C₁-C₆ alkoxy; a 
group of the formula -O-C(O)-Ra, wherein Ra is hydrogen, 
C₁-C₆ alkyl optionally substituted with amino, halo, 
carbonyl, C₁-C₆ alkoxycarbonyl, C₁-C₇ alkanoyloxy, 
carbamoyl and/or aryl; or Ra is C₁-C₆ alkenyl optionally 
substituted with aryl; or Ra is a C₃-C₇ cycloalkyl; or Ra 
is aryl optionally substituted with hydroxy, C₁-C₆ alkyl, 
C₁-C₆ alkoxy, and/or halo; or Ra is -O-aryl, said aryl 
optionally substituted with hydroxy C₁-C₆ alkyl, C₁-C₆ 
alkoxy, and/or halo,
 
   or R is a group of the formula -O-SO₂-Rb wherein 
Rb may be C₁-C₆ alkyl or aryl optionally substituted with 
C₁-C₆ alkyl;
 
   or R is carbamoyloxy wherein the nitrogen may be 
substituted once or twice with C₁-C₆ alkyl;
 
   or R is a group of the formula -O-C(O)Rc-O-(C₁-C₆ 
alkyl) wherein Rc is a bond or C₁-C₆ alkanediyl;
