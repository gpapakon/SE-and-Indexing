<ABSTRACT>
In order to sift more quickly a stream of bulk materials, this is done in a state of fluidised bed. The size of the sifting means (4) may thus be reduced. To sustain the state of fluidised bed on the sifting surface (16), said surface is short and if required several sifting surfaces (16) are successively arranged and separated by airing sections (17).

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for screening a stream of bulk material, which forms a conveying path

over and beyond a screen surface, characterized in that at least one aeration
bottom and at least one screen surface (16) are arranged in the conveying path in

succession with the same conveying direction.
Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterized in that a plurality of aeration
bottoms (17) and screen surfaces (16) are arranged in succession.
Apparatus according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the screen surface or
screen surfaces (16) is or are connected to a vibrating drive (10).
Apparatus according to Claims 2 and 3, characterized in that the aeration bottom / aeration
bottoms (17) and screen surface or screen surfaces (16) are combined to

form a unit which can be jointly vibrated.
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterized by a device for
generating a differential pressure conducive to the screen passage.
