<ABSTRACT>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a sensitive DC current sensor, 
which has a relatively simple construction and a detecting capability with a 

good linearity, against current variations in a wide range from a microscopic 
current to a relatively large current (e.g. about 0.2 A to 20 A). In the 

configuration, wherein an exciting coil and a detecting coil are wound in a 
toroidal shape around a core consisting of an annular soft magnetic material, 

when a triangular waveform exciting current which produces a magnetic field 
exceeding a coercive force of the core is applied to the exciting coil, a direction 

of the magnetic flux in the core is inverted, whereby an absolute value and a 
direction of a DC current flowing through a lead wire being detected can be 

detected, by detecting an inverse timing by a pulse voltage produced in the 
detection coil for comparison measurement of the pulse intervals.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a DC current sensor, 
which is used in a wide field such as a current instrumentation 
in maintenance of a switch-board control circuit signal, 
detection of analog current signals from various sensors 
installed in large-sized equipments in a steel mill and the like, 
and the current instrumentation for controlling small-sized DC 
equipments, particularly, it relates to a sensitive DC current 
sensor having a relatively simple construction and a detecting 
capability with a good linearily, against variations in a wide 
range from a microscopic current to a relatively large current 
(e.g. about 0.2 A to 20 A). In recent years, equipments using a DC current sensor 
are increasing in many technical fields, and for operating these 
equipments safely and smoothly, DC current instrumentation is 
inevitable and the sensitive DC current sensor is badly needed. 
As such DC current sensor, a hall device method, a magnetic 
amplifier method and magnetic multi-vibrator method are 
known (Japanese Patent Application Laid Open Nos. Sho 47-1644, 
Sho 53-31176, Sho 59-46859).  The hall device method is constituted such that, a lead 
wire being detected is directly wound around a core made of a 
soft magnetic material, in which a hall device is disposed partly 
and a gap portion is formed, in a toroidal shape, whereby a 
magnetic flux variation in the core according to the variation of 
DC current flowing through the lead wire being detected is 
detected directly by the hall device. The magnetic amplifier method and magnetic multivibrator 
method are that, a core made of soft magnetic material, 
around which a detecting coil is wound in a toroidal shape, is 
used, the lead wire being detected is disposed through the core, 
and by DC magnetic deflection of the core made of soft magnetic 
material within a saturated magnetic flux density (Bs) by the 
DC current flowing through the lead wire being detected, 
imbalance is produced at a time, where an alternating magnetic 
flux produced by applying an AC current to the coil wound 
around the core beforehand reaches saturation, in the positive 
and negative directions, and the variation is detected by the 
detecting coil. In the magnetic amplifier method, since the magnetic 
flux variation is produced in the core beforehand, it is 
constituted such that, an exciting coil is wound around the core 
to apply determined AC current therethrough, but in the 
magnetic multi-vibrator method, it is constituted such that, self-oscillation 
is produced
