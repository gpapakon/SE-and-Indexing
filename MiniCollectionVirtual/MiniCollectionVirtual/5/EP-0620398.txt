<ABSTRACT>
In the case of an apparatus for the subsequently lining of a buried supply line by drawing in, in sections, a pipe consisting of plastic, in particular polyethylene, a heating chamber (1) is arranged upstream of the start of the respective section of the supply line. The pipe (2) which is to be drawn into the supply line is guided through the heating chamber (1), its outer lateral surface being thereby exposed to heat, and the heating chamber exhibiting, at its end, a compressing die (3) which is provided with conically tapering compressing surfaces (4) and is intended for reducing the diameter of the pipe (2) heated in the heating chamber (1). In order to be able to process thick-walled plastic pipes by means of said apparatus and also thereby to achieve the through-heating of the pipe wall which is necessary for the subsequent compressing operation, an additional heating device (11) is arranged within the pipe (2) upstream of the compressing die (3). The heating device (11) is supported on the inner wall (16) of the pipe (2) and maintains its axial position while the pipe (2) is being guided through the heating chamber (1). The heating device (11) is preferably fastened on a cable (18) which is guided out of the pipe (2), at the rear end of said pipe, and is fastened at a stationary location (20).
