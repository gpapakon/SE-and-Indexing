<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of Alcaligenes
faecalis penicillin G acylase for the hydrolysis of the optionally
substituted phenyl- or heterocyclic acetyl side chain of some
penicillanic and cephalosporanic acids and derivatives thereof.Penicillin G acylase (benzylpenicillin amidohydrolase, also
named penicillin amidase; EC 3.5.1.11) is an enzyme used commercially
to hydrolyse penicillin G or 3'-desacetoxycephalosporin G
to phenylacetic acid and 6-aminopenicillanic acid (6-APA) or 7-aminodesacetoxycephalosporanic
acid (7-ADCA), respectively, the
most important intermediates for the industrial production of
semi-synthetic penicillins and cephalosporins. This enzyme also
catalyses the reverse reaction, viz. the N-acylation of 6-APA
and 7-ADCA with organic esters to generate their corresponding
N-acetylated penicillin and 3-cephem compounds, respectively.
See the reviews of Vandamme, E.J., In: Microbial Enzymes and
Bioconversions, E.H. Rose (Ed.), Economic Microbiology 5, 467-552
(1980); and P.B. Mahajan, Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 1, 83-86
(1982).In NL-7502291, DE-2458746, NL-7414302, NL-7416549, NL-7117696
and DE-3316796 deacylation of cephalosporins with substituents
on the 3'-position, viz. a substituted -CH2 group, has been
described. However, the yields mentioned are not higher than 92%.Deacylation activity of E. coli penicillin acylase, applied
on an oxidized form of benzylpenicillin, has been described in
Tetrah. Lett. 29(36), 4623-4624 (1988). However, a special protection
of the carboxy group has been taught. In J. Antibiotics
31(8), 783-788 (1978) it was mentioned that the (S)sulphoxides
and the sulphone of benzylpenicillin were not hydrolysed by the
E. coli enzyme (penicillin G acylase) preparation. G. Alvaro etal. (Enzyme Microb. Technol. 13, 210-214 (1991) disclose the
application of said inertia of penicillin G sulphoxide towards
both Escherichia coli and Kluyveromyces citrophila penicillin G
acylase by using the same as stabilizing agent upon the immobilization
of penicillin G acylase.In EP-A-0453047 a new penicillin G acylase originating from
Alcaligenesfaecalis has been disclosed.Besides the good stability and high specific activity of
said Alcaligenesfaecalis penicillin G acylase, the enzymatic
activity of the same on carboxyl unprotected penicillins with
optionally substituted G side chains on the 6-position, and
cephalosporins with optionally substituted G side chains on the
7-position and optionally substituted 3-methyl side chains has
never been taught or
