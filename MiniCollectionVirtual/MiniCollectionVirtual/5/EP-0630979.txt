<ABSTRACT>
Especially for security strips for anti-theft installations, magnetically soft materials having a particularly rectangular magnetisation characteristic curve and low inductance are required, so that it is possible, on the one hand, to filter out a high signal and, on the other hand, to keep the field strength in the investigation zone as low as possible. The production of strips particularly suitable for this purpose employs a nickel base alloy containing more than 60% by weight of nickel and additions of niobium and titanium, each above 0.5%, as well as a proportion of copper in the range from 2 to 16% by weight, said nickel base alloy being cold-worked (cold-formed) and then being subjected to a heat treatment at a temperature of over 600 DEG C for at most 2 h.
