<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for the contactless determination of specific heat capacity, in which a single pulse or a pulse train of a beam or a plurality of electromagnetic beams are thrown onto the test body and a reference sample, and in which both the effect of the test body temperature induced with time is measured and infrared radiation emitted from the body, and the reflected radiation, are measured so that the specific heat capacity can be determined with respect to a reference sample, taking into account the mass or density of the test body and, at the same time, the thermal conductivity can be determined.
