<ABSTRACT>
A method of attaching and sealing a straight walled tubular fitting (10,26) 
to a block or valve body (14). The end of the tubing is closely fitted in a 

counterbore (12) which has an undercut groove (20) with a recessed 
elastomeric seal ring (22) with the inner edges of the groove chamfered (18). A 

tubular insert (30) having a thickened wall (32) portion at one end is received in 
the tube so the thickened wall is coincident with the seal ring. A tapered punch 

(38,40) is driven in the thickened end of the insert, causing the tubing wall to 
bulge locally and expand into the chamfered groove to secure the tube in the 

block and seal against the seal ring.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to techniques for attaching rigid conduits 
onto a solid block as, for example, the body of a valve. In particular, the 
invention relates to techniques for attaching refrigerant tubing to the block of a 
thermal expansion valve employed for controlling refrigerant flow in a closed 
system. Heretofore, refrigerant tubes have been attached to the body or block of 
the thermal expansion valve, particularly in automotive air conditioning 
applications, by means of providing a flanged fitting on the end of the tube and 
valve block with the aid of a clamp bar and face sealing O-rings. However, this form of attachment has proven to be troublesome, and due 
to strain on the tubes, subject to leakage. This is particularly the situation 
where the tubes are lengthy and subjected to vibration as in automotive air 
conditioning applications when the severe vibration in service causes the 
fastening means employed to secure the clamp plate on the tube flange to 
loosen and permits the connection to leak refrigerant. Thus it has been desired to find a way or means of attaching rigid 
refrigerant conduit fittings to a solid block, such as the body of a thermal 
expansion valve in a manner which is low in cost to facilitate mass production, 
such as encountered in automotive air conditioning applications, and yet 
provide a reliable seal having a long service life. Referring to FIG. 4, a known technique for installing a tube fitting on a 
thermal expansion valve is shown where a conduit 1 has a convolution or 
annular bulge in the tube formed thereon. The conduit in the known technique 
of FIG. 4 is inserted in a counterbore with an O-ring 4 provided therein which 
seals around the outer surface of the conduit. A circular flanged portion 3 
formed on the valve block is then deformed with a tool over the convolution on 
the tube and retains the tube in position in the block.  The present invention employs a straight metal tube fitting received in an 
undercut counterbore formed in a solid block or valve body, with the undercut 
groove having an elastomeric seal ring disposed therein. The straight tube 
fitting has an insert provided therein which has a thickened annular end portion 
which coincides with the axial station of the seal ring when the tube is inserted 
in the counterbore. A tapered punch is inserted in the fitting and moved axially 
therein to expand the thickened end portion of the insert. Upon radial 
expansion of the thickened portion of the insert radially outwardly

<CLAIMS>
A method of attaching and sealing relatively thin walled fluid conduits to a 
ported block or valve body comprising: 


(a) forming a bore in the block (12,16) communicating with said port and 
forming an undercut groove (20) in the bore and disposing a resilient 

seal ring (22) therein; 
(b) inserting the end of a conduit (10,26) in said bore; 
(c) disposing a tubular insert (30) with a thickened wall portion (32) in 
said bore; and, 
(d) inserting a tool (38) and expanding the thickened wall and forcing the 
wall of said conduit in said groove and sealing against said seal ring. 
The method defined in claim 1, wherein the step of inserting a tool includes 
inserting a tapered punch (40). 
The method defined in claim 1, wherein said step of forming an undercut 
groove includes chamfering (18) the inner edges of said groove.
