<DESCRIPTION>
This invention was made with United States of America Government
support under Contract No. N00019-91-J-4023 awarded by the Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency (DARPA). The United States of America Government
has certain rights in the invention.The present invention relates generally to methods for the synthesis
of various diamond materials such as diamonds, diamond films and
similar diamond materials. This invention specifically relates to utilizing novel
sources of reaction species (novel
sources of carbon and/or hydrogen and/or seeds) for the manufacture of 
various diamond materials and the use of such materials for various commercial
purposes.There are various known methods for producing synthetic diamond. In a
first method, diamond grit may be synthesized by precipitating diamond from
carbon contained within a metal solution at high temperatures (e.g.,
1400째C) and high pressures (e.g., 60kbar). The resulting diamond which is
produced at these high temperatures and high pressures may be free of
second phase inclusions, but generally contains significant concentrations
of dissolved nitrogen and metal (e.g., nickel, iron, cobalt, etc.).In a second technique, diamond powder may be produced by shock wave
synthesis, wherein an explosive charge Is utilized to shock a mixture of
carbon and a metal solvent/catalyst. An example of the shock wave
synthesis technique can be found in U.S. Patent No. 3,401,019, which issued
on September 10, 1968, in the names of Cowan et al. Drawbacks of the shock
wave synthesis procedure are that the diamond which is produced Is
routinely contaminated with dissolved nitrogen and metal (e.g., iron). In
addition, the recovery of diamond particles produced requires elaborate
chemical processing to separate the diamond particles from the surrounding
materials within the reaction chamber (e.g., graphite and metal).
Moreover, this method typically produces only submicron diamond powders.In a third technique, diamond powder can be made by precipitation of
diamond within certain amorphous metals which are saturated with carbon
For example, U.S. Patent No. 4,485,080 to Shingu et al., which issued on
November 27, 1984, describes a multi-step process for the rapid
solidification of carbon-containing alloys followed by the precipitation of
diamond particles within the amorphous metal at temperatures above 100째C.
The diamond is thereafter recovered from the metal by acid digestion.In a more recent development, thin diamond films are synthesized from
the vapor phase by an activated
