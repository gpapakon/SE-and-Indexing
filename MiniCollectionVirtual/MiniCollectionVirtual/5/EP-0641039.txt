<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is an improved electric connector which 
is designed to be integrally connected to an electric 

machine or apparatus, assuring the good electric connection 
to the input terminals of an electric machine or apparatus. 

Each terminal 14a or 14b of the electric connector has a 
slit 21a in its tail 18, the main slit-defining edges 22 

being used to make an electric connection with each input 
terminal 7a or 7b of the electric machine or apparatus.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to electric 
connector terminals, electric connectors and an electric 
connector assembling method, particularly to an improvement 
in or relating to electric connector terminals and electric 
connectors designed to be integrally connected to blade 
terminals on electric machines and appliances. As is well known, required electric connections 
between the input terminals (or electrodes) of electric 
machines and appliances such as small-sized electric motors 
and associated electric power supplies or controls were 
made by soldering or crimping wires to the input terminals 
(or electrodes) of electric machines and appliances and to 
the conductors extending from the electric power supplies 
or controls. Such wire-soldered or wire-crimped connections, 
however, required laborious works, and still 
disadvantageously, connection to and disconnection from 
exterior conductors could not be performed with ease. United States Patent Number 5,287,028 proposed a 
connector housing integrally connected to an electric 
motor. The connector housing has an electric connector 
fitted therein with the inner terminals designed to be 
connected to the input terminals of the electric motor and 
the outer terminals designed to be detachably connected to 
the exterior lead wires extending from an associated power 
supply or control for making required electric connections  
 
between the electric motor and the associated power supply 
or control. In this prior art the input terminals of the 
electric machine or apparatus rise upright from the casing 
of the electric machine or apparatus, extending toward the 
connector housing whereas the inner terminals of the 
electric connector rise upright from the connector housing, 
extending toward the casing of the electric machine or 
apparatus. Required electric connections can be made by 
forcing the connector housing against the electric motor 
with the inner terminals of the connector in alignment with 
the input terminals of the electric motor. The inner 
terminals of the electric connector are cut-and-raised 
strips of sheet metal. These strips are forced into 
contact with selected input terminals of electric motor 
when the connector housing is applied to the electric 
motor. The cut-and-raised strips or inner terminals of 
the electric connector are liable to be deformed or 
inclined by undesired exterior force before the connector 
housing is applied to the casing of the electric motor. 
This could cause incomplete connections between the

A low profile electrical connector for 
mating with a blade terminal (7a, 7b) including: 

   a housing (10) having a terminal receiving cavity 
(11a, 11b); and 

   a female terminal (14a, 14b) mounted in the 
cavity (11a, 11b) having a mating end (20) to engage said 

blade terminal; 
the improvement comprising: 

   said mating end (20) including a generally planar 
portion that is transverse to the direction of insertion of 

the blade terminal; and 
   an opening (21a) formed int he planar portion to 

receive the blade terminal, said opening being defined by 
two spaced-apart sides, each side adapted to engage an 

opposing surface of the blade terminal (7a, 7b) when mated, 
one of said sides having means (22) to engage and retain 

the blade terminal in the opening and means (21b) to make 
at least one side resilient relative to the other side; 

   whereby, the opening (21a) has the flexibility to 
receive insertion of the blade terminal (7a, 7b) therein 

with a minimum of force while retaining the blade terminal 
therein after insertion. 
The connector of claim 1 wherein said means 
to engage and retain the blade terminal includes a sawtooth 

shape (22) formed in said one side. 
The connector of claim 1 wherein said means 
making said one side opening resilient includes an aperture 

(21b) adjacent said one side. 
The connector of claim 3 wherein said 
aperture includes a slot (21b) parallel to said one side. 
A low profile electrical connector for 
mating between a blade terminal (7a, 7b) and a flat 

flexible cable (30) including: 
   a housing (10) having a cable receiving cavity 

(13) and a terminal receiving cavity (11a, 11b); and 
   a female terminal (14a, 14b), mounted in said 

terminal receiving cavity (11a, 11b) and having two mating 
ends (17, 20), one mating end (20) adapted to engage the 

conductors (31) on the flat flexible cable (30); 
   the improvement comprising: 

   said one mating end (20) including a generally 
planar base portion that is transverse to the direction of 

insertion of the blade terminal, having an opening (21a) 
formed in the planar portion to receive the blade terminal 

(7a, 7b), said opening being defined by two spaced-apart 
sides, each side adapted to engage an opposing surface of 

the blade terminal when mated; and 
   said other mating end (17) including at least a 

flexible arm (16) extending from said planar base portion 
(15) bent to contact a conductor (31) on said flat flexible 

cable (30) when said cable is inserted in said cable 
receiving cavity (13).
