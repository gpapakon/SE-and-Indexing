<ABSTRACT>
To separate matter bonded within or clinging to a solid body, the body in initially ground and reduces and the particles are vibrated to apply a force of at least 2 g to the vibrating particles. Also claimed is appts with a recirculating fan (5), a centrifugal separator (7), a fine dust filter (8), at least one heat exchanger (6,9) and an active carbon filter (10). The air flowing through the oscillating bed (2), with its feed and exhaust openings, is deflected (5-10) in a circuit (11). While the particles are vibrated, they are also subjected to a gas flow round them, applying a pressure to them equal to the gravity applied to the particles, with a gas temp of 0-100 and esp 40-60 deg C. The matter released from the particles is recovered from the gas pref air. During vibration, the particles are subjected to an acceleration of 2-10 g and especially 3-4 g. The particles are oscillated at a frequency of 750-3000 pref 1100-1750 oscillations/min, with an oscillation amplitude on average of 1-10, pref 2-5 mm.
