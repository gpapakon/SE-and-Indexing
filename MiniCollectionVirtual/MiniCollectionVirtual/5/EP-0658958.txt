<ABSTRACT>
An electrical connector is provided with a housing (14) 
having a first member (20) and a second member (22), 

electrical contacts (16) and retention members (18). The 
electrical contacts are fixedly connected to the first member 

and extend through the second member. The retention members 
fixedly connect the first and second housing members to each 

other and include a mounting section for mounting the housing 
to a printed circuit board (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to electrical connectors and, 
more particularly, to a retention member that connects 
housing members to each other and connects the housing to 
a printed circuit board. U.S. Patent 4,934,961 discloses a bi-level card edge 
connector. U.S. Patent 4,756,694 discloses a card edge 
connector with angled solder tails. Burndy Corporation of 
Norwalk, Connecticut manufactures and sells right angle 
card edge connectors having solder tails that are bent 90° 
after they exit the rear end of the housing of the 
connector. In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention 
an electrical connector is provided comprising a housing, 
electrical contacts, and retention members. The housing 
has a first member and a second member. The electrical 
contacts are fixedly connected to the first member and 
extend through the second member. The retention members 
fixedly connect the first and second members to each other. 
Each retention member has a mounting section for mounting 
the housing to a printed circuit board. In accordance with another embodiment of the present 
invention an electrical connector is provided comprising a 
housing, electrical contacts, and retention members. The 
housing has a first member and a second member. The 
electrical contacts are mounted to the housing. The  
 
retention members are connected to the housing. Each 
retention member has means for fixedly connecting the first 
and second members to each other and, means for fixedly 
connecting the housing to a printed circuit board. In accordance with another embodiment of the present 
invention an electrical connector for electrically 
connecting a first printed circuit board to a second 
printed circuit board is provided comprising a first 
housing member, a second housing member, retention members, 
and electrical contacts. The first housing member has a 
card edge receiving area and first retention member 
receiving areas. The second housing member has second 
retention member receiving areas and contact passages. The 
retention members are located in the first and second 
retention member receiving areas and fixedly connect the 
first and second housing members to each other. The 
retention members have extended ends that extend past the 
second housing member for positioning in holes of the 
second printed circuit board. The electrical contacts are 
fixedly connected to the first housing member and extend 
through the second housing member. The electrical contacts 
have at least one turn that

<CLAIMS>
An electrical connector comprising: 
a housing (14, 82) having a first member (20, 86) and a 

second member (22, 88); 
electrical contacts (16) mounted to the housing; and 

retention members (18, 84) connected to the housing, each 
retention member having means for fixedly connecting the 

first and second members to each other and means (76-78, 96) 
for fixedly connecting the housing to a printed circuit board 

(12). 
A connector according to claim 1 wherein the first and 
second members are comprised of molder polymer material and 

the retention members are comprised of metal. 
A connector according to one of the claims 1 or 2 wherein 
the first member includes a card edge receiving area (24). 
A connector according to claim 3 wherein the second member 
includes a keeper section substantially parallel to the card 

edge receiving area. 
A connector according to one of the claims 1 to 4 wherein 
some or all of the retention members include a first section 

(66) interlockingly positioned in a first retention member 
receiving area (30) in the first member. 
A connector according to claim 5 wherein at least some of 
the first retention member receiving areas (30) have a slot 

shape with a large section (32), a small section (34), and 
apertures (36, 38) on two orthogonal sides of the first 

member into the slot shape. 
A connector according to claim 5 or 6 wherein the 
retention members each include a second section (68) fixedly 

connected to the second member. 
A connector according to one of the claims 1 to 7 wherein 
the connecting means includes two spring cantilever retention 

arms (76, 77) having enlarged heads (78) at distal ends of 
the arms for snapping into a hole (80) in the printed circuit 

board. 
A connector according to one of the claims 1 to 8 wherein 
the retention members are formed from a flat sheet of metal 

that is cut and formed such that the retention members are 
substantially flat except for their first sections which have 

a flat offset shape. 
An electrical connector according to one of the claims 1 
to 9 wherein the electrical contacts are fixedly connected to 

the first member and extend through the second member, and 
each retention member has a mounting section (76-78, 96) for 

mounting the housing to a printed circuit board (12). 
A connector according to claim 9 wherein the retention 
members are flat metal members having their first sections 

deformingly offset from a plane of the rest of the flat metal 
member.

have at least one turn that redirects the contacts about 90° 
between the first and second housing members. 
A connector according to one of the claims 1 to 13 
wherein the second member has a keeper section (50) with the 

contact passages therein, the keeper section being parallel 
to, but offset from the card edge receiving area. 
A connector according to one of the claims 1 to 14 
wherein the second housing has spacers adjacent to a side of 

the first housing for spacing the side of the first housing 
from the second printed circuit board.
