<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to patterned 
spunlaced fabrics and a process of making the same. 
More particularly, the invention relates to patterned 
spunlaced fabrics formed of synthetic fibers and 
woodpulp and/or woodpulp-like fibers, which fabrics 
exhibit very low wet and dry particle counts and good 
absorbency. Fabric wipers used in cleanroom applications 
require low particle generation when tested in air and 
water environments. In addition, cleanroom wipers must 
exhibit adequate absorbency rates and capacities. 
Unfortunately, particle generation and absorbency 
properties for many fabrics are many times mutually 
exclusive of each other. For example, untreated 100% 
polyester fabrics generate very low wet and dry 
particle counts but provide almost no absorbency. On 
the other hand, cotton fabrics or fabrics containing 
woodpulp exhibit high absorbency rates and capacity but 
typically generate unacceptably high wet and dry 
particle counts. In the past, commercially available 
non-patterned spunlaced woodpulp/polyester fabrics (55 
wt.% woodpulp/45 wt.% polyester) have proved adequate 
when used in Class 100 cleanroom environments. Federal 
Standard 209E, September 11, 1992, defines airborne 
particulate cleanliness classes of air in cleanrooms  
 
using both English and metric units, and specifies that 
Class 100 air shall have no more than 100 particles 
(0.5 micrometer or larger) per cubic foot, or the 
equivalent metric designation of no more than 3530 
particles (0.5 micrometer or larger) per cubic meter 
for Class M 3.5 air. Although Class 100 environments 
may be currently acceptable for non-sensitive 
operations, it has become increasingly desirable to 
have even lower particle counts for sensitive high-tech 
cleanroom applications. U.S. Patent 3,485,706 (Evans) discloses 
hydroentangling fibrous webs to produce textile-like 
patterned nonwoven fabrics. The hydroentanglement 
process calls for imparting high energy water jets 
(i.e., usually between about 200 and 2,000 psi) to a 
fibrous web to entangle the web and produce a spunlaced 
fabric. In Figure 40 of Evans, a continuous commercial 
process is depicted wherein the fabric is subsequently 
dewatered by one or more squeeze rollers. 
Unfortunately, the application of high impact energy 
and squeeze roll dewatering produces fabrics which are 
typically unacceptable for sensitive high-tech 
cleanroom wiper applications. Numerous examples in Evans disclose patterned 
spunlaced fabrics. Typically, the patterned spunlaced 
fabrics
