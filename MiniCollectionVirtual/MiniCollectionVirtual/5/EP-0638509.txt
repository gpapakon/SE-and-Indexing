<ABSTRACT>
The demand of the elevator industry for various types of signal device can be met with this modular signal device. A surface-mounted base plate (1) has ends (2) bent up at the narrow sides. A cover ring (3) encloses the base plate (1) and has a bolt (4) at one end and an adjusting screw (5) at the other end, which engage behind the bent-up ends (2). The cover ring (3) has a collar (6) on the inside. A cover plate (7) bears on, and can be fastened to, the collar (6). To accommodate switching means, for example push-buttons, the cover plate (7) has at least one opening (8) and concentrically arranged second stud bolts (9) by means of which the switching means can be fastened to the cover plate (7). First stud bolts (10) serve to fasten the cover plate (7) to the collar (6) of the cover ring (3). In further embodiment variants, lenses with filters, gratings, or lenses with arrow masks are provided as cover plate (7) and they transmit to the outside the signals of the signal devices arranged on the collar (6).
