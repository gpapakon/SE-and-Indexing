<DESCRIPTION>
 SIMPLIFIED EXTRACTION METHOD FOR BACTERIAL ANTIGENSUSING DRIED REAGENTSTechnical FieldThe present invention relates to a process for the extraction of polysaccharide antigens from organisms. More specifically, it relates to the extraction of saccharide antigens characteristic of organisms in the family Streptococcaceae, including Group A and Group B Streptococci.Background of the InventionThe traditional method for extraction of saccharide antigens characteristic of Group A Streptococci (GAS) involves the use of all liquid reagents. See e.g. Manual of Clinical Microbiology. 4th ed. (1985) , page 171. This method is well known and can be used for diagnosis of streptococcal infection when performed in conjunction with an immunoassay. Typically, the extraction involves three liquid reagents: an acid (usually acetic acid, hydrochloric acid or citric acid) , sodium nitrite and a neutralizing base or buffer (Tris, sodium hydroxide, etc.) . These reagents are matched in terms of pH and molarity to produce optimal release of GAS saccharide antigen. A typical extraction involves the use of 150 μl of 2M sodium nitrite, 150 μl of 2M acetic acid and 350 μl of 0.44M Tris/0.66N sodium hydroxide. The first two reagents (sodium nitrite and acetic acid) are mixed together in a tube and a swab containing the sample is placed into the solution. The reaction is 

incubated for 1 to 3 minutes and the third (neutralizing) solution is added and mixed. The swab is removed, a tip is inserted into the tube and the contents of the tube squeezed out onto a test device.The procedure described above requires that accurate volumes of the three reagents be dispensed since the pH of the final solution must be approximately 7-8 in order to allow for the capture and detection of the released antigens in an immunodiagnostic assay.Disclosure of the InventionThe present invention simplifies the extraction process described previously and thereby reduces the potential for variability among test results. The result of this simplification is the development of an extraction process with two dried components and a single liquid reagent. One embodiment of the invention is a method of extracting polysaccharide analytes from a clinical sample. The clinical sample is incubated with a first absorbent material impregnated with a nitrite salt, an acid solution is added and is followed by the addition of a second absorbent material impregnated with a neutralizing base or buffer.A second aspect of the invention is a method of extracting polysaccharide
