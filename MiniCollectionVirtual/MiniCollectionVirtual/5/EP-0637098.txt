<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a universal connection terminal for the connection of electrical conductors (70, 71) of different cross-sections without having to strip the insulation. The connection terminals are especially, but by no means exclusively, suitable for making contact with varnished wires of various coil components. The terminal element (1) according to the invention has a plurality of clamping slots (6, 7) with different opening cross-sections. The end section (10) of a cable (line, lead) (70, 71) with which contact is to be made is inserted into the terminal element (1) in such a manner that contact is made on a clamping slot (6, 7) having an opening cross-section which is matched to the cross-section of the cable with which contact is to be made. The clamping slots (6, 7) are arranged in such a manner that clamping slots having opening cross-sections which are too small do not touch the cable with which contact is to be made. The clamping slots (70, 71) have a suitable profile and edge surfaces, which are advantageously inclined like blades, in order to cut through the insulation skin of the cables. The parallel connection of a plurality of cables is also possible. The terminal element (1) of the connection terminal is formed integrally from a folded, electrically conductive substrate.

bent in such a way that it encloses the U-shaped first  

 
end (141) of the substrate and fixes said first end
