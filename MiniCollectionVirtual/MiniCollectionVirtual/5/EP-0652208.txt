<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is related to phenylalkan(en)oic acids which are
useful for medicines.More particularly, this invention is related to:
1) phenylalkan(en)oic acids of the formula:

(wherein all of the symbols are the same meanings as hereinafter
defined) and non-toxic salts thereof,2) processes for the preparation of them and3) antagonistic agents on leukotriene (abbreviated as LT
hereinafter) B4 containing them as active ingredient.The metabolic routes, in which various compounds are
biosynthesized from the same mother compound, i.e. arachidonic
acid, are called "Arachidonate cascade" as a whole.Arachidonic acid is metabolized by the action of lipoxygenase,
e.g. 5-lipoxygenase, 12-lipoxygenase, and 15-lipoxygenase, to 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic
acid (abbreviated as HPETE
hereinafter), 12-HPETE and 15-HPETE, respectively.These HPETEs are converted into 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic
acid (abbreviated as HETE hereinafter), 12-HETE and 15-HETE,
respectively, by the action of peroxidase which convert a
hydroperoxy group to a hydroxy group. Furthermore, LTA4 is also
produced from 5-HPETE. LTA4 is converted into LTB4 and LTC4.
LTC4 is converted into LTD4 by the action of γ-glutamyl
transpeptidase. Moreover, it has been defined that LTD4 is
metabolized to LTE4 (see Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 91, 1266
(1979) and Prostaglandins, 19(5), 645 (1980)).Moreover, the action of LTB4 has been gradually identified
recently. Namely, it as been identified that LTB4 having the
following structure:
 
(wherein the double bonds between 6th- and 7th- carbon, 8th- and
9th-carbon, 10th- and 11th- carbon and 14th- and 15th-carbon, are
Z, E, E and Z, respectively), possesses a powerful action of
polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNLs) accumulation and PMNLs
adhesion, and PMNLs degranulation (see Nature, 286, 264 (1980),
Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA, 78, 3887 (1981) and J.Biol. Chem., 256,
5317 (1981)). Moreover it has been considered that LTB4 promotes
the release of arachidonic metabilites by attacking various cells as
it has the powerful action like calcium ionophore (see J. Biol.
Chem., 257, 4746 (1982)).Moreover, LTB4 in high concentration has been detected at
the sites of various inflammation, for example, rheumatism, spinal
arthritis (see Klickstein L.B., Shapleigh, C. and Goetzl, E.J. (1980)
J.Clin. Invest., 66, 1166-1170), gout (Rae, S.A., Davidson, E.M. and
Smith, M.J.H. (1982) Lancet II 1122-1123), psoriasis (see Grabbe,
J., Czarnetzki, B.M., Rosenbach, T. and Mardin, M. (1984) J. Invest.
Dermatol., 82, 477-479), ulceractive
