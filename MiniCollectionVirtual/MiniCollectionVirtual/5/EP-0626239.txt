<ABSTRACT>
A screw positioning and feeding attachment to a power 
screwdriver advances screws in a tape one-by-one as the 

preceding screw in a screw tape is screwed in by pushing 
a slide assembly (2), in contact with a board or sheet 

for example, into a slide housing (1). Different lengths 
of screws are accomodated by an adjustable extension (25) 

of the slide assembly (2). The proximal end (9) of the 
extension (25), at the end of its inward stroke, strikes 

against a spirally curved abutment disc (8) which can be 
rotated for fine adjustment of the final depth of the 

screw head. Since the extension (25) travelling in a 
groove in the slide housing (1) is directed towards the 

axis of rotation of the spirally curved disc, which 
always presents a nearly perpendicular striking surface, 

the disc will not be rotated out of adjustment by the 
repeated impact of the extension (25).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a screw positioning and 
feeding device, comprising a slide assembly engaging a 
tape or belt holding a plurality of screws, for feeding, 
by relative reciprocal movement between the slide 
assembly and a slide housing, said screws one-by-one to a 
position to be driven in by a screwdriver bit in a power 
screwdriver coupled to said device Devices of the above described type, in the form of a 
unit which can be mounted on a power screwdriver or power 
drill with a screwdriver bit, have been available for 
some fifteen years now, to make the job of setting up 
gypsum board or plywood with screws go much more quickly 
and easily. Screws can be sold premounted in plastic tape 
for easy handling. To position screws one-by-one for 
screwing, the tape or belt is fed through the device, 
said tape being aligned to successively bring each screw 
into position for screwing in. Specially designed perforations 
in the tape, surrounding each screw shank, allow 
the tape to rupture and the screw head to pass through 
the enlarged hole as the screw bit screws in the screw. 
In this type of feeder attachment, sprocket wheels engage 
notches in the tape or belt and advance the same one 
screw for every screw that is screwed in. One example of a previously known device of this type is 
described in DE 2 541 046 (Helfer). A ratchet wheel 17 
cooperates with a sprocket wheel unit 9 to advance a 
screw tape one screw for each forward movement of the 
slide housing (see Figs. 1 and 2 in said specification). 
The ratchet wheel is rotated by a pin 18 following a slot 
19 in the slide housing 3. (See Fig. 3). Adjustments for 
different lengths of screws are made in this prior art 
device by a screw ring 30 mounted on the power screwdriver  
 
mounting, against which ring stop pins abut to 
limit the stroke. This makes the device longer and more 
front-heavy than is necessary. These problems are overcome 
by a screw positioning and feeding device of the 
type described by way of introduction which is characterized 
in that different lengths of screws are accommodated 
by an extension adjustably fixed to the slide 
assembly, the distal end of said extension abutting, 
during use, against the surface of the material to be 
screwed into and the proximal end of said extension striking 
against a rotatable abutment disc securely fixed in 
said slide housing, when the slide assembly reaches the 
end of its reciprocal inward stroke into the slide housing, 
said abutment disc having a spirally curved

Screw positioning and feeding device, comprising a 
slide assembly (2) engaging a tape or belt holding a plurality 

of screws, for feeding, by relative reciprocal 
movement between the slide assembly (2) and a slide 

housing (1), said screws one-by-one to a position to be 
driven in by a screwdriver bit in a power screwdriver 

coupled to said device, characterized in 
that different lengths of screws are accommodated by an 

extension adjustably fixed to the slide assembly (2), the 
distal end of said extension abutting, during use, against 

the surface of the material to be screwed into and 
the proximal end of said extension striking against a 

rotatable abutment disc (8) securely fixed in said slide 
housing (1), when the slide assembly (2) reaches the end 

of its reciprocal inward stroke into the slide housing 
(1), said abutment disc having a spirally curved peripheral 

abutment surface presenting, in each rotational 
position, a tangential striking surface approximately 

perpendicular to a radial line (14) extending from the 
axis of rotation of said abutment disc through the point 

of abutment with the proximal end of said extension which 
moves along said radial line during its reciprocal movement. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the adjustment plate has a central 

longitudinal slot (4) provided with an individual notch 
for each nominal length of screw to be used in the 

device, a pin or tightening screw (5) engaging said notch 
to hold the adjustment plate in place relative to the 

slide assembly (2).
