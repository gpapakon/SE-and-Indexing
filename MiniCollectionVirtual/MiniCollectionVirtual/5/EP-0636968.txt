<ABSTRACT>
A method of dynamic programming by means of factorisation is disclosed, which allows dynamic programming to be used to solve problems which have hitherto been regarded as insoluble by means of dynamic programming, usually because of an unacceptable requirement for computing time or operating equipment. In dynamic programming, the solution operation requires iterative extensions of the boundary relations by means of combination with new relations. The invention is based on this approach, in that it represents the boundary relations in a factorised form and then formulates computing methods for extending these boundary relations, without actually calculating their extensional forms. There is presented a series of algorithms for achieving such a computing methodology by finding pure factors of given primitive side-condition relations.
