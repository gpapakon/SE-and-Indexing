<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a direct contact 
crystallizer. In particular, the invention is concerned with a draft 
tube, direct contact crystallizer employing a nozzle 
injection system which enables the use of cryogenic 
fluid such as gaseous or liquid nitrogen to 
simultaneously cool and agitate a crystal slurry for 
the production of crystals. Continuous suspension of crystallizing solids 
and supersaturated liquid is very important for growing 
uniform crystals. A direct contact crystallizer is 
used to prevent fouling on heat transfer surfaces. 
Early designs of direct contact crystallizers used high 
volumes of refrigerants injected through spargers or 
distributors. Examples of refrigerants suggested for 
use in direct contact crystallizers include freon, 
water, alcohol solution, butane, propane, and air. 
However, these crystallizers have a very limited 
operating temperature range and have failed to provide 
true solid suspension or thorough mixing. Commercially operated direct contact 
crystallizers are known which use mechanical units to recompress 
refrigerants such as propane or butane. These 
mechanical-type crystallizers are equipped with 
agitators for vigorously stirring the slurry and 
keeping the crystals in suspension. The speed of the 
agitator must be fast enough to prevent large crystals 
from settling and coagulating in the bottom of the 
vessel. However, fast rotating agitators can break  
 
down large crystals on impact. In addition to breaking 
down large crystals, the impact of crystals on the 
mechanically agitated surfaces of other crystals 
promotes secondary nucleation. Secondary nucleation is 
the cause of excess fine crystals which are difficult 
to filter and are easily caked, thus, requiring 
recycling. It is known that a cryogenic liquid or gas is 
able to provide a large amount of refrigeration to a 
crystal slurry. The other advantage of a cryogenic 
fluid such as liquid nitrogen is that it is inert and 
will not contaminate the crystal slurry. 
In 
conventional direct contact crystallizer practice, gas 
or liquid coolant is passed into a solution through a 
distributor which distributes the coolant over a wide 
area causing the coolant to bubble throughout the 
solution. By means of such coolant distribution, 
effective heat transfer with the solution is attained. 
The conventional practice of coolant introduction 
through a distributor, while effective in conventional 
crystallization practice, is inadequate if a cryogenic 
gas or liquid were to be employed as the
