<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus for the processing of 
photographic sheet materials and particularly for developing exposed 
photographic material, and more particularly to apparatus for 
developing lithographic offset printing plates. In an apparatus or system for the development of aluminium 
lithographic printing plates of the type disclosed in EP 410500, 
during processing the photographic sheet material it is an advantage 
if the carry over from one chemical bath to another chemical bath is 
kept to a minimum. It is therefore known to use pairs of squeegee 
rollers at the exit of a chemical bath to remove excess chemicals 
from the sheet material as it exits the bath. A good removal of 
processing liquid is also required to reduce the drying time of the 
sheet material after the last process bath, and hence to reduce the 
energy use. In order to obtain good imaging quality it is necessary for the 
rollers at the exit of each bath, hereinafter called "squeegee 
rollers", to exert a load in the order of 0.5 - 6.0 N pro cm roller 
length to remove excess processing materials. To this end the 
rollers are biased together, typically by springs which act on the 
ends of the roller shafts. Since the rollers have an elastomeric surface, if the apparatus is 
left with the squeegee rollers biased together, even without any 
processing fluid being present, the sqeegee rollers may become 
temporarily deformed. When the apparatus is restarted this may 
result in poor quality image reproduction for the first few plates 
processed on the restart, after which the deformation disappears. During the processing of the photographic material any "processing 
roller", including a squeegee roller as well as another roller, can 
become coated with gelatin. If the apparatus is switched off with 
the rollers stationary, some disturbing crystalisation on the 
rollers may occur, which may reduce the quality of the printing  
 
plates to be processed. Moreover, if the apparatus is switched off 
with the rollers stationary and any roller pair biased together, 
then the rollers may become glued together by the gelatin. As a 
result the roller surfaces may become damaged, and the drive gears 
may also be damaged when the apparatus is restarted. In EP application 92203312.1 (filed on 28.10.92) a solution to the 
above-mentioned problem is described, comprising ingeneous 
mechanisms. However, if some excessive developing material is 
contaminating said mechanisms, the effective reliability of the 
processing apparatus may be

Apparatus (10) for processing photographic sheet material 
including at least a first and a second processing roller (31,32) 

rotatable on respective first and second roller shafts 
(33,34,35,36), said first and said second processing roller being 

placed one above the other and biased together, characterised in 
that there is provided at least at one end of at least said first 

roller shaft (33) a rotating means (27) for transporting said sheet 
material in the processing direction and at each end of at least 

said second roller shaft (35, 36), a displacement means (28,29) 
operably connected with said second roller shaft for relative 

displacement of said second roller (32) away from and to said first 
processing roller (31). 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in that said two 
roller shafts (33, 34,35,36) are mounted at each end in bearings 

(110, 120, 130) held in respective subframes (140) so that said 
first processing roller (31) is an upper roller and said second 

processing roller (32) is a lower roller. 
Apparatus according to claim 2, characterised in that said first 
processing roller (31) is an upper roller which axis coordinates are 

fixed in subframes (140) and which roller is axially slideable in 
said subframes for manual removal of said first processing roller 

and in that said second processing roller (32) is a lower roller 
being biased towards the upper roller by spring means (95,105). 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in that said 
rotating means (27) is driven by a motor with an encoding disc 

system in order to control the speed and the progressing position of 
the sheet material. 
Apparatus according to claim 1 or 4, characterised in that said 
rotating means (27) further comprises a transmission comprising a 

wormscrew (41) and a wormwheel (42) for driving said first 
processing roller (31) and a set of two cooperating helical gears

shafts (33,35), and mounted thus that resulting axial forces on said 

roller shafts are directed towards the frame at the drive side. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in that said 
displacement-means (28, 29) comprises an index disc for controlling 

the exact position of the processing rollers (31,32). 
Apparatus according to claim 1 or 6, characterised in that said 
displacement means (28, 29) comprises a cam mechanism (92,102) at 

each end of said second roller shaft (35, 36) that cooperates with a 
spring means (95, 105) to cause the processing rollers (31, 32) to 

move apart. 
Apparatus according to claim 7, characterised in that said cam 
mechanism (92, 102) comprises tappets (94, 104) which are 

interchangeable at different tappet lengths.
