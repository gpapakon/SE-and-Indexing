<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to preparation
of thin film materials. More specifically the invention
relates to the glow discharge deposition of thin film
materials; and more specifically, the invention relates to
a microwave energerized glow discharge deposition process
carried out in a particular pressure and power regime,
which process is particularly well suited for the
preparation of semiconductor materials.Glow discharge decomposition is employed for the
preparation of thin films of a variety of materials such as
semiconductor materials, insulating materials, optical
coatings, polymers and the like. In a typical glow
discharge deposition, a process gas which includes a
precursor of the material being deposited, is introduced
into a deposition chamber, typically at subatmospheric
pressure. Electromagnetic energy, either AC or DC is
introduced into the chamber and energizes the process gas
so as to create an excited plasma therefrom. The plasma
decomposes the precursor material and deposits a coating on
a substrate maintained proximate the plasma region.
Frequently the substrate is heated to facilitate growth of
the deposit thereupon. This technology is well known in
the art. Early glow discharge depositions employed either 
direct current, low frequency alternating current or radio
frequency alternating current to energize the plasma; radio
frequency current is still very widely employed for this
purpose.One particular drawback to glow discharge
deposition processes was their relatively low speed and in
an attempt to increase deposition rates those of skill in
the art turned to the use of microwave energized plasmas.
The earliest microwave energized depositions were carried
out in pressure ranges typical of those employed for radio
frequency energized deposits, that is to say, pressure
ranges of approximately one torr. These depositions were
generally not practical for semiconductor materials. While
the rate of deposition was quite high, the materials
produced thereby were distinctly inferior to those produced
with radio frequency energy. The early prior art Microwave
deposited materials tended to include large numbers of
polymeric inclusions and other deviant morphologies; hence,
these materials typically were not suitable for use in
electrical or optical devices.In a second generation of microwave energized,
glow discharge decomposition processes it was recognized
that deposition gas pressures significantly lower than
those employed in radio frequency energized depositions
should be employed.
