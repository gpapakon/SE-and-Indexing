<ABSTRACT>
A method for manufacturing reclosable plastic bags or 
packages, wherein sections of zipper profiles are pre-softened 

at intervals equal in length to the width of the bags or 
packages to be manufactured. The pre-softening enables the 

zipper profiles (18,20) to be fused together and completely flationed 
when a seal bar (32) clamps thereacross to form a side seal area (34) 

transverse to the zipper.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the manufacture of
plastic bags or packages having two plies of thermoplastic
sheeting, both plies having closure strips formed or included
on their facing inner edges so as to form a sliderless zipper
closure for the openings of the bags or packages made
therefrom. The plies may be formed of two separate sheets or
a single sheet folded over.The present invention relates to improvements in the
package-making art and may be practiced, without limitation, in
the manufacture of thermoplastic bags and trays of the kind
that may be used for various consumer products, but which are
particularly useful for food products which must be kept in
moisture and air-tight packages, free from leakage until opened
for access to the product contents, which packages are then
reclosable by zipper means to protect any remainder of the
product therein.The indicated art is fairly well developed, but
nevertheless is still susceptible of improvements contributing
to increased efficiency and cost effectiveness.One problem that still exists in the production of
packages from continuous zipper-equipped sheet material, is the 
difficult in attaining a satisfactory sealing of the bag or package against
leakage, where the zipper and area of film engaged by the zipper extends
through the side seal areas separation one bag or package from the next.Document US-A-4812192 discloses a process for manufacturing
thermoplastic bags having thickened sections resulting from the presence of
zipper closures comprising the steps of:
preblocking thermoplastic material in areas of said material to be severed
and sealed which are located adjacent to the zipper closure portions
thereof;next, blocking said thermoplastic material in areas of said material to be
severed and sealed which are located both adjacent to said zipper closure
portions and throughout remaining sections thereof to render said
thermoplastic material tacky and temporarily stick said multiple plies
together in said areas ;preheating said zipper closure portions of said material in said areas
thereof to be severed and sealed by applying heat thereto by contacting
said zipper closure portions with block like elements preheated within a
range of 176,66°C to 287,77°C (350 to 550 °F), andthen, contacting all of said areas of said thermoplastic material to be
severed and sealed with a heated cutting and sealing element so as to
sever all of said multiple plies and concurrently seal said severed margins
thereof together.The features of the method according

<CLAIMS>
A method for manufacturing plastic bags or packages wherein a
longitudinally extending continuous plastic zipper having male and female

profiles (18, 20) on interior surfaces of the plastic bag or package provides a
resealable closure between two plies of plastic sheet material (10), said

plastic sheet plies being welded together with a transverse seal (34) at
preselected intervals separated by a distance corresponding to the width of

the bags or packages being produced to thereby provide side seals
separating said bags or packages, said method comprising the steps of:


providing a continuous plastic zipper with male and female profiles
(18, 20) between two plies of said plastic sheet material (10) which form the

interior surfaces of said bag or package ;
directing heat to a relatively short length of said continuous plastic
zipper profiles (18, 20) whereby to presoften sections of said male and

female profiles within said relatively short length of plastic zipper; and,
making a transverse crosswise seam (34) across said two plies of
plastic sheat material (10) and through said persoftened male and female

profile sections (18, 20),

   characterized in that said directing heat step is accomplished by
directing a hot air blast at the surfaces of said male and female profile

sections (18, 20) within said relatively short length of said continuous plastic
zipper to be softened, from between said two plies.
The method in accordance with claim 1 wherein said male and female
profiles (18, 20) are interlocked prior to directing heat thereon.
The method in accordance with one of claims 1 or 2, wherein heat is
directed to said relatively short length of said continuous plastic zipper (18,

20) at a plurality of locations.
The method in accordance with one of claims 1 to 3, wherein said plastic
sheet material (10) is folded into a generally tubular shape to provide said 

two plies of plastic sheet material and said hot air blost is directed at said
surfaces of said male and female profile sections (18, 20) from within said

generally tubular shape.
The method in accordance with one of claims 1 to 4, wherein said hot air
blast is directed against said surfaces of said male and female profile

sections (18,20) simultaneously from more than one direction.
The method in accordance with one of claims 1 to 5 wherein said plastic
sheet material (10) and said continuous plastic zipper (18, 20) are

separately provided and further comprising prior to the step of heating a
relatively short length of said continuous plastic zipper, the steps of:


attaching said male profile (18) of said continuous plastic zipper to
one of said plies of plastic sheet material (10),
attaching said female profile (20) of said continuous plastic zipper to
the other of said plies of plastic sheet material.
The method in accordance with claim 6 further comprising, prior to said
attaching steps, the step of directing heat at said relatively short length of

said continuous plastic zipper to presoften the male and female profile
sections (18, 20) of said relatively short length of continuous plastic zipper

prior to attaching said zipper to said plies of sheet material (10).
The method in accordance with claim 7 further comprising interlooking
said male and female profiles (18, 20) prior to said heat directing step.
The method in accordance with claim 6 further comprising the step of
interlocking said male and female profiles (18, 20) prior to said attaching

steps.
The method in accordance with one of claims 7 or 8 wherein said heat
directing step is accomplished by directing a hot air blast directly at the 

surfaces of said male and female profile sections (18, 20) within said
relatively short length of said continuous plastic zipper to be presoftened.
The method in accordance with claim 10 wherein said plastic sheet
material (10) is folded into a generally tubular shape and said hot air blast

for preheating is directed at said surfaces of said male and female profile
sections (18, 20) from within said generally tubular shape.
The method in accordance with one of claims 10 or 11 wherein said hot
air blast for preheating is directed against said surfaces of said male and

female profile sections (18, 20) simultaneously from more than one
direction.
The method in accordance with one of claims 1 to 12 wherein the plastic
sheet material (10) is moved incrementally in amounts equal in length to the

width of the bags or packages being manufactured.
The method in accordance with one of claims 1 to 13 wherein the male
