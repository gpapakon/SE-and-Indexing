<ABSTRACT>
Arrangement for dissipation of heat, in particular for dissipating heat losses from an electronic component or a module (2; 211 to 214), having a heat diffuser (1, 1'; 11 to 14; 912 to 914) formed separately from the component or the module, and with a thermally conductive plastic body (8; 81 to 810; 812b to 814) formed directly on one surface of the heat diffuser, which plastic body is, at least during operation of the component or of the module, in contact with the latter or its surface.

Process for the production of an arrangement to dissipate
heat from the housing of a heat-loss generating

electronic circuit component, or a corresponding subassembly
with a separately formed moulding (811; 812a) of

heat-conducting synthetic material which is arranged
directly on the surface of an additional heat diffuser,

connected to the housing of the circuit component or of
a corresponding subassembly in a manner so as to conduct

heat, is located between the housing of the circuit
component or of a corresponding subassembly and

the heat diffuser, contacts the heat diffuser (1, 1';
11 to 14; 912 to 914) in a laminar fashion and can be

elastically moulded or compressed at least in some areas,

characterized in that
 synthetic material (8') in a
plastic state is to be dispensed under pressure, from a

storage container via a hollow needle (6), or a jet, in
the form of a strand with a cross-sectional shape which

corresponds substantially to the interior cross-section
of the jet or hollow needle, directly on one area (3a)

of the heat diffuser onto which the moulding (8) is to
be formed, and after application is to be hardened or

crosslinked into a corresponding elastic body whilst
maintaining its cross-sectional shape.
Process for the production of an arrangement to dissipate
heat from the housing of a heat-loss generating 

electronic circuit component, or a corresponding subassembly
with a separately formed moulding of heat-conducting

synthetic material which is arranged on the
surface of the housing (2, 211 to 214) of the circuit

component or of a corresponding subassembly, contacts
the housing of the circuit component or of a corresponding

subassembly in a laminar fashion and can be
elastically moulded or compressed at least in some areas,


characterized in that
 synthetic material (8') in a

of the housing of the circuit component or of a corresponding
subassembly on which the moulding (8) is to be

formed, and after application is to be hardened or
crosslinked into a corresponding elastic body whilst

maintaining its cross-sectional shape.
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in
that
 the hollow needle (6) or jet is guided by driving
means, especially computer-controlled, along a predetermined

path over the area (3a) of the part (1) on
which the moulding (8) is to be formed.
Process according to Claim 1, 2 or 3, 
characterized in
that
 in order to produce a multi-layer moulding (8),
the needle (6) or jet is moved at least over predetermined

sections of the area (3a) on which the
moulding is to be formed several times in such a way

that a specified shape of the moulding is formed from a
plurality of strands of the synthetic material (8'),

wherein a subsequent strand is applied before hardening
or crosslinking the surface of the preceding strand so 

that both strands join together in a material-conforming
fashion after hardening or crosslinking.
Process according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that
 on
repeated guiding of the needle (6) or jet over the predetermined

areas, synthetic materials which harden in a
differently-elastic or differently-compressible manner

are applied.
Process according to any of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized
in that
 the plastic synthetic material is applied
at room temperature.
