<ABSTRACT>
A recording module is described comprising a number of 
LEDs arranged in a linear array and means for gradation-controlling 

said LEDs, by changing their operative 
periods of time corresponding to recording gradation data 

having 2
n
 levels. The described circuit comprises an Nxn-bit 
shift register (34) having N n-bit storage addresses 

and N n-bit outputs and first clock means for controlling 
the shift register. The circuit also comprises a latch 

register (35) for storing the contents of the N n-bit 
storage addresses of the shift register, the latch 

register having N n-bit output paths. The circuit also 
comprises modulator means for establishing a relation 

between operative period of time and gradation data for 
each LED, and second clock means for controlling the 

modulator means. The shift register (34), the latch 
register (35) and the modulator means (38) are integrated 

on one semiconductor chip (22). The modulator means 
comprises N modulators (38), one for each LED.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an recording module 
comprising a number of recording sources arranged in a 
linear array and means for gradation-controlling said 
recording sources. More in particular, the invention 
relates to the formation of images on a light-sensitive 
material by gradation-controlling an LED (light-emitting 
diode) array in an electronic printer, said gradations 
being obtained by modulating the pulse width of the 
current signals driving the LEDs. In many existing non-impact printers, an image is 
recorded by repetitively producing lines of spots, each 
spot being formed by means of one of a number of 
recording sources which are arranged in a linear array, 
said recording sources delivering a controlled amount of 
energy to a receptor surface in order to form a latent 
image on said receptor surface. Also, said non-impact 
printers comprise means for developing said latent images 
and transferring the developed images to the output 
medium, being paper or the like. In practice, the 
recording sources are arranged in a number of recording 
modules, each recording module comprising a plurality of 
recording sources so that the manufacturing of said 
linear array of recording sources becomes more feasible. In most cases, the recording sources are controlled in a 
binary manner, that is, each recording source is driven  
 
by means of a binary signal that switches the recording 
source either on or off. In order however to reproduce 
images containing multiple gradation levels, a technique 
called binary half-toning is used. With said binary 
half-toning, the impression of gradation is achieved by 
modulating the size of the pixels that constitute the 
image. In electronic printing for example, the pixels 
are therefore built up as matrices of small basic spots 
of a fixed size and density. Modulation of a pixel's 
size is then achieved by varying the number of spots, 
constituting said pixel, that are assigned to the higher 
of the possible two density levels. As an alternative 
for binary half-toning, some printers provide means to 
control the amount of energy emitted by each recording 
source so that each printed spot can have multiple 
gradation levels. It is clear that this technique is 
superior to binary half-toning since it allows images to 
be recorded with a much higher spatial resolution. As an example of a printer incorporating recording 
sources being controlled in a binary manner, European 
patent EP-BI-0 142 579 (Agfa-Gevaert NV) discloses an 
electronic circuit
