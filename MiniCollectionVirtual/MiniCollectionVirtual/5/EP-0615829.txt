<ABSTRACT>
A filter device for separating solid material waste from thermoplastic material is proposed, in which radially outwardly widening filter holes (15) are provided in a uniformly hollow-cylindrical filter element (9). Resilient scrapers (21) of a rotating scraper shaft (19) bear against the inner convex surface of the filter element (9). The filter element (9) is supported radially outwards by means of a supporting tube (11) in a cylindrical chamber (5) of a housing tube (7). The supporting tube contains inner grooves (27), which helically surround the filter element (9) and merge at the overlapping points into axially running, outer grooves (29).

A separating apparatus for separating materials of different consistency,
particularly for separating synthetic thermoplastics-solids mixtures or mixtures of

synthetic plastics which have different melting properties, comprising:


a housing (1, 7c)
a hollow cylindrical filter body (9c) consisting of a tubular piece of material with
filter holes (15c) passing radially through the filter body (9c) and disposed in an

approximately cylindrical chamber (5c) in the housing (1, 7c),
a scraper shaft (19) mounted in the housing (1, 7c) and driven to rotate in the
same axis as the filter body (9c) and which passes axially through the filter body

(9c), forming an annular space (25) and carrying on its shell at least one scraper
(21) bearing resiliently on the filter body (9c) and projecting radially in respect

of the filter body (9c);
a conveyor means introducing the material mixture into the annular space (25)
under pressure,
enclosing the filter body (9c), bracing means (11c) which radially brace the filter
body (9c) through bracing ribs (39c) and which form a plurality of approximately

axially extending first channel portions (53c) distributed over the periphery of the
the filter body (9c) and second channel portions (27c) situated between the

bracing ribs (39c) and extending crosswise to the first channel portions (53c),
the bracing ribs (39c) being integrally formed on the filter body (9c) and the

first channel portions (53c) being provided in a bracing tube (11c) in which the
filter body (9c) is coaxially seated,
a first material outlet (31) connected to the outside of the filter body (9c) via the
first (53c) and second (27c) channel portions, and
a second material outlet (33) with reflux facility and connected to the inside of
the filter body (9c),
 
characterised in that the first channel portions are formed by substantially axial

bores (53c) extending in the wall of the bracing tube (11c) and each of which is
connected to the inside of the bracing tube (11c) by a slot (55) extending the

length of the bore (53c) and in that the diameter of each bore (53c) is greater than
the width of the associated slot (55).
A separating apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in that the filter holes
(15c) widen out from the inside of the filter body (9c), the widening being in

particular conical or step-like.
A separating apparatus according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the second
channel portions (27c) are disposed in the form of at least one helix.
A separating apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the
bracing tube (11d) is composed of a plurality of equi-axially and serially disposed

tube portions (59) having the same inside diameter and separable from one another
and in that the first channel portions (53d) extend through the tube portions (59)

and in that in the individual tube portions (59), the cross-sectional area remains
substantially constant along the tube portion (59) but does however increase from

tube portion (59) to tube portion (59) in the direction of the first material outlet
(31).
A separating apparatus according to claim 4, characterised in that the first channel
portions (53d) are constructed as bores the diameter of which increases from tube

portion (59) to tube portion (59) in the direction of the first material outlet (31).
A separating apparatus according to claim 5, characterised in that the bores (53d)
of adjacent tube portions (59) are radially offset in respect of one another and are

at substantially the same clear distance from the centre (61) of the bracing tube
(11d). 
A separating apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 6, characterised in that at
one end, particularly the material feeding end, the filter body (9) has a radially

outwardly projecting flange (47) by which it is rotationally rigidly fixed to the
housing (1, 7).
A separating apparatus according to claim 7, characterised in that the flange (47)
is fixed by being clamped between a housing part (1) and the bracing tube (11).
