<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates primarily to novel compounds which are antagonists of
platelet activating factor.Platelet activating factor (PAF) is a bioactive phospholipid which has been
identified as 1-O-hexadecylloctadecyl-2-acetyl-sn-glyceryl-3-phosphoryl choline.
PAF is released directly from cell membranes and mediates a range of potent
and specific effects on target cells resulting in a variety of physiological
responses which include hypotension, thrombocytopenia, bronchoconstriction,
circulatory shock, and increased vascular permeability (oedema/erythema). It is
known that these physiological effects occur in many inflammatory and allergic
diseases and PAF has been found to be involved in a number of such disorders
including asthma, endotoxin shock, adult respiratory distress syndrome,
glomerulonephritis, immune regulation, transplant rejection, gastric ulceration,
psoriasis, cerebral, myocardial and renal ischemia. Thus the compounds of the
invention, by virtue of their ability to antagonise the actions of PAF, should be
of value in the treatment of any of the above conditions and any other conditions
in which PAF is implicated (e.g. embryo implantation).Compounds that have been disclosed as possessing activity as PAF antagonists
include compounds which are structurally related to the PAF molecule such as
glycerol derivatives (EP-A-0238202), and heterocyclic compounds such as 5-oxy
derivatives of tetrahydrofuran (US-4,888,337) and 2,5-diaryl
tetrahydrofurans (EP-A-0144804). Recently a more potent 2,5-diaryl
tetrahydrofuran derivative, (trans)-2-(3-methoxy-5-methylsulphonyl-4-propoxyphenyl)-5-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)tetrahydrofuran
(L-659,989) has
been disclosed (EP-A-0199324). In our International patent application No.
WO 91/17157 we disclose a series of Î³-butyrolactol derivatives as PAF
antagonists. The compounds of WO 91/17157 differ from the 5-oxy derivatives
of tetrahydofuran described in US-4,888,337 and from the 2,5-diaryl
tetrahydrofurans such as L-659,989, in that they feature an appended
heterocycle with an unsubstituted sp2 nitrogen atom. There are a number of
other PAF antagonists, in addition to those of WO 91/17157, for which the
presence of a heterocyclic sp2 nitrogen atom appears to be an important 
requirement for activity (Whittaker, M., Curr. Opin. Thera. Patents 2(5), 583-623 (1992)).International patent applications WO 92/03423, WO 92/03422, WO 92/18503 and WO 93/14069
disclose compounds with PAF antagonist activity, all characterised by the presence in the structure
of a
