<ABSTRACT>
The tubular container (3) has at its upper edge a tear-off securing ring (1) which prevents the stopper (4) being taken off without prior removal of the securing ring (1). The securing ring has in total a cylindrical shape and, in its simplest design, is an extension of the tube (3) which terminates flush with the smooth upper side of the top plate of a knurled stopper (4). The securing ring (1) is connected to the tube via tear-off webs (2) which can be moulded on by lateral slides. The top plate (5) of the knurled stopper rests tightly against the inner wall of the securing ring (1), and the knurled stopper is seated with a clamping or engaged fit in the mouth of the tube.
