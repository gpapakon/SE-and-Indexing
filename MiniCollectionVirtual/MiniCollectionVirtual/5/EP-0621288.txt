<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a method of making polyethylene wherein 
ethylene, a catalyst, a cocatalyst and a solvent are added 

to a reactor. A first mixture is formed of the ethylene and 
either the catalyst or the cocatalyst and a second mixture 

is separately formed of the solvent and the other of the 
catalyst or cocatalyst. These two mixtures are then 

combined in a reactor to produce the polyethylene.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process wherein a catalyst, 
a cocatalyst, a solvent, a monomer, a comonomer and hydrogen 
are added to a reactor to make polyethylene. In particular, 
it relates to that process where the catalyst and cocatalyst 
are kept separate until they are added to the reactor. In a high pressure solution process for preparing 
polyethylene, the catalyst and cocatalyst are typically 
premixed in a small solvent stream (S1) outside of the 
reactor. This mixture (S1) and the main reactor feed stream 
(S2), which contains the remaining solvent, the monomer, and 
other reaction ingredients, are then separately added to a 
continuously stirred reactor. However, under certain 
production conditions of the reactor, it was difficult to 
control the temperature within the reactor. Specifically, 
the temperature within the reactor would fluctuate about 
20°C every three or four minutes. This cyclical change in 
temperature affected the physical properties of the 
resulting polyethylene resin. This change in physical 
properties caused a swing in the extruder nose pressure, 
which is a direct measurement of the polymer melt flow 
properties through the die plate. Because of the 
temperature swing, the amount of monomer being reacted 
varied also. This was directly reflected in the amount of 
unreacted monomer recycled back to the reactor. No one knew  
 
what was causing this problem or how this problem could be 
solved. In addition, the catalyst and cocatalyst mix tees, 
where the catalyst and cocatalyst were mixed with solvent in 
S1, would periodically plug up with solids. A plant 
shutdown was required several times a year to clean them. 
This pluggage was caused by activated catalyst solids 
precipitating out onto the walls of the piping system. It is an object of the present invention to eliminate 
or alleviate most of the above-described problems. This object has been solved by the finding that the 
catalyst and cocatalyst are not mixed together outside of 
the reactor, but are separately mixed with either the S1 or 
S2. Accordingly, a method according to claims 1 to 12 and a 
polyethylene obtainable according to the method of claims 1 
to 12 are subject of the present invention. In the method 
of this invention, the temperature within the reactor fluctuates 
only about 1°C instead of the previous 20°C. As a 
result, the properties of the resin are much more uniform. Very unexpectedly, we have found that polyethylene 
resin produced by the process of this invention also has a 
broader
