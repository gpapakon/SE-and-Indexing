<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a combine harvester with a screen device and with a chaff-distributing device which is arranged behind the latter and which can be pivoted away for the purpose of servicing the screen device. For this purpose, the crossmember 4 carrying the two rotor housings 5 and 6 and the distributor discs 7 and 8 is formed from two individual crossmembers 13 and 14 which can be coupled to one another in the abutting region by means of a hand lock 15. The mutually opposite ends of the individual crossmembers 13 and 14 are pivotably suspended on fixed bearing bolts by means of pivoting fittings, so that the two individual crossmembers can be pivoted from the operating position into a vertical servicing position laterally next to the combine-harvester side walls.

A combine harvester having a sieve device and a device for 
distributing the grain-chaff mixture over the entire cutting width of the 

combine harvester, which device substantially comprises two rotatingly 
drivable distributor discs (7, 8) arranged in fixed rotor housings (5, 6), 

wherein the rotor housings (5, 6) and the distributor discs (7, 8) are 
fixedly mounted on a transverse structure (4), characterised in that the 

transverse structure (4) is formed from two individual transverse members 
(13, 14) which can be connected together in the junction region by a 

coupling device (15), and that each individual transverse member (13, 14) 
is pivotably suspended by means of a pivot fitting (20, 21) to an axis 

(28, 29) which is at the outside and which is remote from the junction 
region of the individual transverse members (13, 14), in such a way that 

each individual transverse member (13, 14) is pivotable into a horizontal 
operative position and into a vertical or approximately vertical 

maintenance position. 
A combine harvester according to claim 1 characterised in that 
each pivot fitting (20, 21) substantially comprises a guide tube (22, 23) 

and a base plate (24, 25) which is arranged transversely relatively 
thereto and to which is fitted a mounting sleeve (26, 27) which is 

rotatably mounted on a mounting pin (28, 29) forming the pivot axis. 
A combine harvester according to claim 2 characterised in that 
the mutually facing end regions of the individual transverse members (13, 

14) are guided in the guide tubes (22, 23) of the pivot fitting (20, 21) 
at least in the axial direction by positively locking guide elements. 
A combine harvester according to claim 3 characterised in that 
the mutually remote end regions of the individual transverse members (13, 

14), preferably in the limit positions of being moved away from each 
other, are rotatable within the positively locking guide elements with 

respect to the guide tube (22, 23) in such a way that the rotor housings 
(5, 6) can be moved from the position of being inclined relative to the 

horizontal into a horizontal position.  
 
A combine harvester according to claim 3 and claim 4 
characterised in that the positively locking guide elements are formed 

from angular slots or angle grooves (34, 35) in the outer guide tubes (22, 
23), and guide projections (36, 37) which are fixed in the end regions of 

the individual transverse memoers (13, 14) and which engage into the angle 
grooves (34, 35) or into the angular slots. 
A combine harvester according to one or more of preceding claims 
1 to 5 characterised in that the mutually remote end regions of the two 

individual transverse members (13, 14) are in the form of tube portions of 
annular cross-section and project outwardly relative to the rotor housings 

(5, 6) in the operative position and that the mutually facing regions of 
the individual transverse members (13, 14) comprise quadrangular tubes 

with a side length which is greater than the outside diameter of the end 
regions. 
A combine harvester according to claim 6 characterised in that 
the mutually remote end regions of the individual transverse members (13, 

14) are provided with an outer sliding covering, preferably in the form of 
a sliding bush (19) non-rotatably connected to an inner tube (18). 
A combine harvester according to one or are of the preceding 
claims characterised in that a damping element for braking the pivotal 

movement of the individual transverse members (13, 14), preferably in the 
form of an oil-pressure spring (38), is pivotally connected to each guide 

tube (22, 23) of the pivot fitting (20, 21). 
A combine harvester according to one or are of the preceding 
claims characterised in that each distributor disc (7, 8) is drivable by 

way of an individual drive, preferably in the form of a hydraulic motor 
(9, 10).
