<ABSTRACT>
The present invention concerns the use of an anti-tumor 
effective amount of a TMA complex and/or a fragment of 

this TMA complex which is interspecific for the 
microorganisms belonging to the MNC group and showing, after 

electrophoresis, the immunoelectrophoretic precipitation 
pattern corresponding to that of antigen complex 60 pattern 

of the

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns the use of an anti-tumor
effective amount of antigen and/or a fragment of this antigen
for the manufacturing of a medicament for the treatment
and/or the prevention of cancer.Among the treatments for cancer, chemotherapy and
radiotherapy are very efficacious means for the primary
elimination of leukemias, neoplasms and tumors, whereas
surgery allows the excision of solid tumors. However, the
prolongation of the life expectancy of patients successfully
treated is often not satisfactory because of relapses.Immunotherapy used as an antitumoral weapon derives
from the need of treatments complementary to chemotherapy
which, if the kinetics of first order is followed, is
theoretically unable to eradicate "the last subsisting
tumoral cell".Remissions of a breast, prostate or lung carcinoma
after surgery , irradiation or chemotherapy may last from 5
to 25 years, followed by relapse. As long as the immune
system of the patient in remission functions normally and is
not unduly solicited, the remaining tumor cells subsisting 
in the organism of the patient after a primary intervention
will stay controlled and will not induce a relapse.Tumor cells escape the immunological surveillance
of the host by diverse mechanisms, of which the best known
are, on the one hand, the paucity of tumoral antigens that
would allow for the recognition of the neoplasm by the immune
system of the host and, on the other hand, the capacity of
cancers to drastically reduce the immune defences of this
host. When the balance is tilted in favour of the host, at
the expense of the tumor, the immunological defence
mechanisms become efficient.An immunotherapeutic intervention may reasonably
find its place in a scheme of treatment only in case of
recently implanted tumors (M. McKneally et al. : The Lancet,
May 7 (1977), page 1003), of early diagnosed tumors of small
size or of reduced numbers of cells, or after an intervention
(surgery, chemotherapy, irradiations) has reduced the size
of the tumor or the number of leukaemic cells to a proportion
that would allow the immune system to regain control (N.
Gross and A. Eddie : Am. Rev. Resp. Dis., 113, p. 457-464
(1976); G. Math√© et al. Nat. Cancer Inst. Monograph No. 39,
p. 165-175 (1973)).The rejection of neoplasms by immunological means
is partly based on the immune recognition of this neoplasm.
This specific immunotherapeutic approach exploits the
existence of tumor cell surface antigens recognizable by the
immune system of the patient. In practice, this method may
be

<CLAIMS>
Use of an anti-tumor effective amount of a TMA
complex and/or a fragment of this TMA complex which is

interspecific for the microorganisms belonging to the MNC
group and showing after electrophoresis the

immunoelectrophoretic precipitation pattern corresponding to
the antigen complex 60 pattern of the

Use according to claim 1, characterized in that
said medicament further comprises a therapeutic agent specific

against cancer.
Use according to claim 2, characterized in that
the specific therapeutic agent is a tumoral antigen and/or

a non-proliferative tumor cell.
Use according to claims 1 to 3, characterized
in that said medicament further comprises an aspecific therapeutic agent

against cancer.
Use according to claim 4, characterized in that
the aspecific therapeutic agent is chosen among the group

consisting of bicatenary nucleic acids, preferably complexed
to protamine, vitamin C, water-in-oil emulsion and/or a

mixture thereof.
