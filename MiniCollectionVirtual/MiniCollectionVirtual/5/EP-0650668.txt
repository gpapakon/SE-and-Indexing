<ABSTRACT>
A process for the production of a soybean protein 
material comprising the step of slow freezing of a 

solution of a heat-treated soybean protein in the 
presence of an alkaline earth metal, produces a soybean 

protein material which comprises a structure in which 
the layers have grown oriented along the non-cell ice 

crystals. The soybean protein material produced by the 
process has, in the raw condition, an extremely smooth 

mouthfeel such that it melts in the mouth but, when 
heated, has a mouthfeel extremely similar to that of 

meat.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a soybean protein
material and a process for production thereof. More
particularly, it relates to a soybean protein material
having a structure in which the layers are integrally
formed oriented or a structure in which the layers are
fibrously tearable and a process for production thereof.Various protein materials having texture have been
hitherto known. For example, a protein material
obtained by winding and binding "yuba" (dried bean
curds) has a structure in which the layers are formed
concentrically parallel to the surface. Each layer is
composed of a film itself and, therefore, such the
protein material has the same mouthfeel as that of
"yuba" itself in the raw condition and hardly has the
meat-like mouthfeel when heated. In addition, a protein
material manufactured by using an extruder has no
smoothness and softness like "tofu" (bean curd). Such
protein material as such has a lamellar (network) and
porous structure and hardly has a layered structure.Next, there is known a method for producing a
protein material having texture by coagulating and
freezing a protein. "Kori-tofu" (freeze-dried bean
curd) is obtained, typically, by freezing and aging
"tofu" which has been prepared harder. However,
"kori-tofu" has a sponge-like and porous (cell-like)
structure and no layered structure based on
freeze-denaturation. In addition, the formation of the
fibrous structure of muscle and the layered structure of
muscle bundle by freezing animal fibrous muscle as a raw
material is described in JP-B 5-68221. The resulting 
protein material has a texture based on a fibrous
texture.US-A-3,922,359 describes a method of producing
solid protein material with a spongy (not layered)
texture, which comprises adding an edible divalent
salt to a solution of soybean protein in such an
amount that the solution becomes turbid white with
protein, a part of the protein being still dissolved,
freezing the said solution, keeping the solution
frozen for from about one to two days, and then
thawing and recovering the resultant solid protein
material. In three of the Examples the soybean
protein solution is heated prior to the addition of
the divalent salt.FR-A-2,130,282 describes a process comprising
freezing an insoluble protein slurry to produce a
product in particular resembling meat.The main object of the present invention is to
provide a soybean protein material having good
mouthfeel.Another object of the present invention is to
provide a process for production of a soybean protein
material

protein material which comprises the step of slow

freezing of a solution of a heat-treated soybean
protein in which precipitates formed from a soybean

protein are not present and containing 0.1 to 35% by
weight of soybean protein based on the weight of the

solution and 0.01 to 5.0% by weight of an alkaline
earth metal based on the weight of the crude protein

oriented along the non-cell ice crystals, wherein the
alkaline earth metal is added before the solution is

heated.

comprising the steps of thawing the frozen soybean

protein material or further dehydrating the thawed
soybean protein material.

structure in which the layers have grown oriented

along the non-cell ice crystals obtainable by slow
freezing of a solution of a heat-treated soybean

protein in which precipitates formed from a soybean
protein are not present and containing 0.1 to 35% by 

weight of soybean protein based on the weight of the
solution and 0.01 to 5.0% by weight of an alkaline

earth metal based on the weight of the crude protein
and having a pH of 5 to 9, wherein the alkaline earth

metal is added before the solution is heated.
