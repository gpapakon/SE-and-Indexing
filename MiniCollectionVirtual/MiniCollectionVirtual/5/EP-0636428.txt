<ABSTRACT>
According to the invention, residual or scrap pieces of carbon-fibre-containing composite materials having organic, carbonisable or carbon matrices are used to produce new carbon-fibre-reinforced composite materials having a carbon matrix with the greatest possible recycling of the carbon content present in the composite materials. The processes provide for the starting materials, if they are not already present in carbonised form, to be carbonised and then, if desired after a comminution step, to be mixed with a carbonisable matrix precursor, to shape the mixture into articles and to carbonise the shaped articles.

<CLAIMS>
Method for recycling waste or remnants 
consisting of composite materials that contain carbon 

fibres having a matrix from the group thermosetting, 
thermoplastic synthetic resins, organic elastomers, 

pitches, mixtures of the afore-mentioned matrix 
substances, characterised in that 


in a first step the waste or remnants are subjected to 
a carbonization treatment process in order to be 

completely converted into constituent parks consisting 
of carbon, 
in a second step the carbonization products from the 
first step are mixed with a carbon-containing binder 

which is capable of being carbonized, 
in a third step the mixture that is obtained by means 
of the second step is shaped by means of a shaping 

device to form a body, 
and in a fourth step the shaped body that is obtained 
by means of the third step is carbonized. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the carbonized products that are obtained after 

the first method step are comminuted before the second 
method step. 
Method according to one of the claims 1 and 2, 
characterised in that, in addition, fillers from the 

group carbon fibres, carbon grains, carbon dust, carbon 
black and pitch in a solid form are added to the 

prepared dry material consisting of carbon constituents 
before or whilst it is mixed with the matrix starting 

product of the subsequent carbon matrix. 
Method according to claim 3, characterised in 
that the additionally added carbon fibres consist of 

remnants and waste material. 
Method according to one of the claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the shaped bodies, which are 

obtained after the carbonization carried out in  
 

accordance with the fourth method step of claim 1, are 
redensified at least once by means of impregnation with 

a liquid carbon carrier and subsequent carbonization. 
Method according to one of the claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the bodies which are shaped in 

the course of the recycling method according to method 
step 3 and are carbonized or the bodies which are 

obtained after a redensification step according to 
claim 5 are additionally heated to graphitization 

temperature.
