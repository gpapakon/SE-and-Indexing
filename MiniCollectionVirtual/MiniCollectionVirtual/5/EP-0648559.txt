<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an apparatus for the production of a casting piece (casting) by lost-pattern casting, including a pattern (1) and a sprue (downgate) (7) made from alveolar pyrolysable material, which are embedded in the compacted sand (5), the said pouring descender being connected to a pouring bush (sleeve, cup) made from refractory material (8). The pattern and the pouring descender are lined with a coating of refractory particles, the coating being, at least locally reinforced by means of an inorganic binder. The invention also relates to a method for the production of a casting using such device.

Apparatus for making a casting by the lost pattern method, the
apparatus comprising a pattern (1) and a casting descender (7) of

cellular pyrolysable material embedded in compacted sand (5), said
casting descender being connected to a casting funnel (8) of

refractory material, the casting descender and the pattern being
coated in a coating (3, 9) of refractory particles, the apparatus

being characterized in that the coating is reinforced (4), at least
locally, by an inorganic binder.
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in that said binder
is a refractory inorganic salt.
Apparatus according to claim 2, characterized in that the binder
is sodium silicate.
Apparatus according to claim 3, characterized in that the sodium
silicate satisfies the formula aSiO
2
, bNa
2
O, where the ratio a/b lies
in the range 0.9 to 3.5, and is preferably about 3.
Apparatus according to any preceding claim, characterized in that
the thickness of the reinforced coating lies in the range 0.3 mm to

3 mm.
Apparatus according to any preceding claim, characterized in that
the locations where the layer of particles is hardened by the binder

have 0.006 g to 0.06 g of binder per cm
2
 of particle layer.
Apparatus according to any preceding claim, characterized in that
the reinforced coating is located:


at locations of the lost pattern where the sand is
insufficiently compacted, in particular at the locations of cavities

in the pattern; and
at locations of the casting descender where the casting
nozzle is present, or where there are changes in the direction or in

the section of the casting descender.
A method of fabricating apparatus according to any one of claims 1
to 7, the method consisting in coating the surface of the casting

descender and of the lost pattern in refractory particles, and being
characterized in that an aqueous solution of an inorganic binder, in

particular a refractory inorganic salt, is deposited on said coating,
at least locally.
A fabrication method according to claim 8, characterized in that
the concentration of the inorganic salt in the solution lies in the

range 20% to 50%.
A fabrication method according to claim 8 or 9, characterized in
that the solution is deposited by spraying followed by drying,

preferably using hot air or microwave heating.
A method of making a casting by the lost pattern method,
characterized in that the liquid metal is cast into apparatus

according to any one of claims 1 to 7, and the casting is recovered
therefrom.
