<ABSTRACT>
A biosensor for rapid quantification of a 
specific component contained in various biological samples 

with high accuracy has an electrically insulating base, an 
electrode system including a working electrode and a 

counter electrode formed on one face of the insulating 
base, and a reaction layer formed on the insulating base 

in close contact with the electrode system. The reaction 
layer contains at least a hydrophilic polymer, a buffer 

and an enzyme which is separated from the buffer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for producing
a biosensor, capable of rapidly quantifying a
specific component in a sample solution with high accuracy
in a simplified manner.Various types of biosensors have heretofore been
proposed as a system for quantifying the specific component
in the sample solution without requiring diluting
or stirring of the sample solution.As an example of such biosensors, a glucose sensor
will be described in the following paragraphs. In general,
a system combining glucose oxidase with an enzyme
electrode or a hydrogen peroxide electrode is already
known as a method of quantifying glucose utilizing the
enzyme electrode. The glucose oxidase selectively oxidizes
a substrate, i. e., β-D-glucose into D-glucono-δ-lactone
by using oxygen as an electron acceptor. During
this reaction, oxygen is reduced into hydrogen peroxide.
By measuring the amount of the oxygen consumed in this
reaction by an oxygen electrode, or by measuring the 
amount of the hydrogen peroxide produced in this reaction
by a hydrogen peroxide electrode which utilizes a platinum
electrode or the like, the glucose in the sample solution
can be quantified.By the above-mentioned method, the measurement
is however adversely influenced with a concentration of
the dissolved oxygen depending on the subject of the
measurement. Further, the measurement is made completely
impossible under a condition lacking oxygen. A type of
the glucose sensor that does not use oxygen as the
electron acceptor but uses a metal complex or an organic
compound such as potassium ferricyanide, a derivative of
ferrocene or a derivative of quinone as the electron
acceptor has therefore been developed. With this type of
biosensor, by oxidizing a reductant of the electron
acceptor produced as the result of the enzyme reaction by
the electrode, the concentration of the glucose can be
determined based on the current consumed for this
oxidation reaction. This manner of measurement is not
limited to glucose but has been widely applied to the
quantification of any other substrate than glucose.As an example of this type of biosensor, a
glucose sensor is known (Japanese Laid-Open Patent
Publication No. Hei 1-114,747) which will be described
below.The disclosed biosensor has a configuration 
comprising an electrical insulating base provided with an
electrode system including a working electrode and a
counter electrode, a filter layer composed of
polycarbonate porous film, an electron acceptor carrying
layer, an enzyme carrying layer, a buffer
