<ABSTRACT>
A centrifugal separator comprises a drum (1) rotatable about its axis within which annular walls (10, 20) define discharge chambers (11, 21) at the ends of the drum, from which separated fluids of different specific gravities are discharged by respective scoops (14, 24). Alternatively, annular walls (44, 45 and 47, 49) define both such chambers at one end only of the drum. The dimensions of the annular walls are chosen so that the separator is self-regulating, in that the separated fluids are discharged independently of the proportions of the fluids in the incoming mixture, so that operation of the separator does not have to be controlled in response to sensing of the separation process within the drum.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to centrifuges, or centrifugal
separators, such as are used separating the components of a
mixed fluid stream.Centrifugal separators typically comprise a vessel with
a cylindrical wall which is rotated about its axis. A
mixture of fluids of different specific gravities is
introduced and concentric annular layers of the individual
fluids are formed, with the fluid of greatest specific
gravity forming the outermost layer against the cylindrical
wall and with the liquid with the least specific gravity
forming the layer nearest the axis. The separation effected
in this way within the centrifuge has of course to be
maintained during extraction of the liquids from it, in
spite of varying proportions of the liquid in the incoming
mixtures. Operation of the centrifuge can be controlled by
a flow control system dependent on the use of sensing
devices to detect the positions of the level of the layers
or radial interface between them, as described, for example
in US Patent 4 846 780. The level or interface sensing
means and related control arrangements represent a
considerable complication, making a substantial contribution
to the complexity and cost of the equipment.The present invention is accordingly concerned with the
provision of a centrifuge or centrifugal separator which is
self-regulating and thus not dependent for its operation on
the sensing of the position within it of an interface
between adjacent layers of separated liquids.The invention accordingly provides in one aspect a
centrifuge for effecting separation of first and second 
fluids of a first and a second, greater, specific gravity,
respectively, from a mixture of the fluids regardless of the
proportions of the fluids in the mixture, the centrifuge
comprising:
a drum having an axis and means for rotating the drum
about the axis and forming an annular layer of the second
fluid around an annular layer of the first fluid, anda first discharge chamber defined by a first wall
providing a first annular weir edge controlling the flow of
the first fluid into the first chamber, and a second
discharge chamber defined by a second wall controlling the
flow of the second fluid into the second chamber,
characterised by first and second stationary members for
drawing off respective fluids in the discharge chambers out
of the drum, wherein
the discharge chambers are defined at opposite ends of the drum
and wherein
a sleeve concentric with the drum axis
extends from the second wall towards the first wall to
provide a generally axial flow
