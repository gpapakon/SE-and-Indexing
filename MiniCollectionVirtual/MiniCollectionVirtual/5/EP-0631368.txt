<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to coil winding method of forming a coil for
a flat motor or such and a combination of a coil winding jig and a coil winding
machine for carrying out the coil winding method.When forming a coil having a polygonal cross section, i.e., what is called
a Vicks coil, by winding a wire, for example, for a flat motor, a coil winding jig
holding a coil form between a pair of flanges must be rotated to wind a first layer, a
second layer, ... and n-th layer sequentially. The spirals of the wire in the second
layer and the following layers must be formed between the spirals of a wire in the
underlying layer in a mutually interposed arrangement to form each layer in a
regular arrangement of spirals.Since a fixed tensile force is exerted on the wire when winding the wire in
a coil, the first spiral of the second layer is forced to fall between the last spiral of
the first layer underlying the second layer and the flange and, consequently, the
spirals of the second layer cannot be formed regularly in a mutually interposed
arrangement over the first layer entailing irregular arrangement of spirals of the
wire in the third layer and the following layers, so that a random coil is formed.Since a tensile force is exerted on the wire when the wire is wound on the
coil form, the coil squeezes the coil form firmly and hence a large force must be
applied to the coil to remove the coil from the coil form.There is disclosed in document DE-B-1 564 485 a coil winding
apparatus comprised of a core, a first fixed flange and a second detachable flange.
The latter flange is provided with a collar member at a position corresponding to
the start of the first spiral of the first coil layer. The member is formed with a
guiding groove which serves to maintain the first and subsequent windings
orthogonal to the core.There is also known from document US-A-4 668 544 a coil winding
apparatus in which there is provided a coil form which presents a polygonal cross
section with an acute angle between two opposite side surfaces.Finally, there is disclosed in document DE-C-25 65 33 a coil winding
apparatus in which the core winding block is provided with a bore at an end
portion for receiving a pin having an enlarged and rounded head that projects onto
the coil receiving surface of the core at a region next to the flange. The profile of 
the head is made to be rounded and have a width corresponding to half a diameter
of the wire to be wound.The present invention has been made in view of such problems in the
conventiona
