<ABSTRACT>
A case (501) containing at least one and preferably several precious stones (511) comprises a casing (503) and a security plate (505). The latter comprises mutually laminated sheets. A computer device comprising an electronic chip is incorporated into the security plate (505) and connected by laminating and/or by an adhesive to the rest of the plate. The casing (3) and the security plate (505) are secured so that the or each precious stone (11) contained in the case (1) cannot be removed therefrom and so that the security plate (5) cannot be separated from the rest of the case (1) without detectable destruction thereof. The security plate (5) includes visible security characters. The electronic chip and the visible security characters make it virtually impossible to falsify (tamper with) the security plate (505). The case (501) containing at least one precious stone (511) is thus suitable for use as a negotiable financial item.
