<ABSTRACT>
The present invention concerns the novel alkyl substituted 
heterocycles of formula I, set out below, wherein Q, Q¹, Q² and R have 

the values defined herein, which antagonize the pharmacological 
actions of one of the endogenous neuropeptide tachykinins at the 

neurokinin 2 (NK2) receptor making them useful whenever such 
antagonism is desired, such as in the treatment of asthma and related 

conditions. The invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions 
containing the alkyl substituted heterocycles for use in such 

treatment, methods for their use, and processes and novel 
intermediates for their manufacture.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns novel alkyl substituted 
heterocycles, and, more particularly, novel substituted piperidine 
derivatives which antagonize the pharmacological actions of one or 
more of the endogenous neuropeptide tachykinins known as neurokinins, 
particularly at the neurokinin 2 (NK2) receptor. The novel alkyl 
substituted heterocycles are useful whenever such antagonism is 
desired. Thus, such compounds may be of value in the treatment of 
those diseases in which an NK2 receptor is implicated, for example, in 
the treatment of asthma and related conditions. The invention also 
provides pharmaceutical compositions containing the novel alkyl 
substituted heterocycles for use in such treatment, methods for their 
use, and processes and intermediates for the manufacture of the novel 
alkyl substituted heterocycles. The mammalian neurokinins comprise a class of peptide 
neurotransmitters which are found in the peripheral and central 
nervous systems. The three principal neurokinins are Substance P 
(SP), Neurokinin A (NKA) and Neurokinin B (NKB). There are also 
N-terminally extended forms of at least NKA. At least three receptor 
types are known for the three principal neurokinins. Based upon their 
relative selectivities favoring the neurokinin agonists SP, NKA and 
NKB, respectively, the receptors are classifed as neurokinin 1 (NK1), 
neurokinin 2 (NK2) and neurokinin 3 (NK3) receptors, respectively. 
In the periphery, SP and NKA are localized in C-afferent sensory 
neurons, which neurons are characterized by non-myelinated nerve 
endings known as C-fibers, and are released by selective 
depolarization of these neurons, or selective stimulation of the 
C-fibers. C-Fibers are located in the airway epithelium, and the 
tachykinins are known to cause profound effects which clearly parallel 
many of the symptoms observed in asthmatics. The effects of release 
or introduction of tachykinins in mammalian airways include 
bronchoconstriction, increased microvascular permeability, 
vasodilation and activation of mast cells. Thus, the tachykinins are 
implicated in the pathophysiology and the airway hyperresponsiveness 
observed in asthmatics; and blockade of the action of released  
 
tachykinins may be useful in the treatment of asthma and related 
conditions. Peptidic NK2 antagonists have been reported. For 
example, a cyclic hexapeptide known as L-659,877 has been reported as 
a selective NK2 antagonist. Nonpeptidic NK2 antagonists also have 
been reported, for example in European Patent Application,
