<ABSTRACT>
A device for aiming a puncture instrument to an area of interest within a patient's body, such as a suspicious breast lesion, is disclosed. The device includes an imaging system (111, 112, 115) and a movable puncture instrument (120) which are isocentric with respect to a common isocenter. An initial calibration process can be performed without the patient to ensure that the puncture instrument (120) is aimed at the isocenter. This is accomplished by positioning the puncture instrument such that a tip thereof does not move when the puncture instrument and/or the imaging system change positions. The patient is then positioned so that the area of interest is located at the isocenter. Proper positioning is achieved when the area of interest does not move as viewed with the imaging equipment in two different positions. The invention allows for real time aiming of the puncture instrument and selection of a puncture instrument penetration path without the need for realignment, re-imaging of the patient, or repeating calculations.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to medical instruments
used in diagnostic penetration of a body to collect a cell
or tissue sample and, more particularly, to such an
instrument incorporating an aiming device for aiming a
puncture instrument to an isocenter of the instrument
wherein a targeted object or area of interest is
positioned. The present invention is particularly useful
for sampling, excising or treating suspicious breast
lesions.The use of puncture instruments for collecting cell or
tissue samples, e.g., from suspicious breast lesions, in
diagnostic examinations is well known. Also well known is
the use of imaging systems such as fluoroscopic imaging
systems for locating an area of interest within a body and
for aiming and guiding a needle. Since such systems
ordinarily provide two dimensional images, two views are
normally required for three-dimensional orientation.Based on the two views, the spatial coordinates of an
area of interest, e.g., a suspicious breast lesion, can be
determined for use in aiming the puncture instrument.
However, the penetration path of the puncture instrument
thus defined is often obstructed by equipment or body
parts, thereby necessitating selection of a different
penetration path. Conventionally, selection of a different 
path entails re-imaging the area of interest and/or
repeating calculations or alignment processes for aiming
the puncture instrument. Such processes are time
consuming, subject the patient to great stress and can
result in errors due to fatigue or patient movement.US 4943986 describes compression apparatus for a
prosthetically augmented breast having an x-ray source
with upper and lower compression plates mounted in one x-ray
path.The present invention discloses an apparatus for
aiming a puncture instrument to an area of interest within
a patient's body and is particularly suitable for aiming
a puncture instrument to an area of interest within the
patient's breast. The present invention allows for real
time, three-dimensional aiming of the puncture instrument
to the area of interest, such as a suspicious breast
lesion, by obtaining appropriate initial alignment of the
area of interest in two imaging views. In addition, the
present invention thereafter allows for real time
selecting of the puncture instrument penetration path by
pivoting the puncture instrument about the area of
interest and observing the instrument on an imaging
monitor or screen without the need for re-alignment, re-imaging
or repeating calculations.According to one aspect of the
