<ABSTRACT>
Metallocenes which are useful as olefin polymerization catalysts are 
prepared by reacting a compound of a metal of the group 4 to 10, lanthanide or 

actinide series of the Periodic Table of the Elements with a magnesium halide salt of a 
cyclopentadienyl containing ligand in the presence of an organic halide so as to form 

the metallocene while simultaneously raising the oxidation state of the metal.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the preparation of metallocenes
which are useful as olefin polymerization catalysts and more specifically to a process
for making metallocenes by metallizing cyclopentadienyl ligand salts with certain
transition, lanthanide or actinide metal compounds while simultaneously raising the
oxidation of the metal with an organic halide.As known in the art, metallocenes can be prepared by reacting a metal
compound of the formula MXn where M is the metal, n is an integer of 1 to 6,
depending upon the valence of M, and X is independently an anionic ligand group or
a neutral Lewis base ligand group having up to 30 non-hydrogen atoms such as
hydride, halo, alkyl, aryl, silyl, germyl, aryloxy, alkoxy, amide, and siloxy, with an
alkali metal or a magnesium halide salt of the cyclopentadienyl ligand in an ether
solvent. In metals having multiple oxidation states, the valence of the transition metal
can be selected to be one less than its desired valence in the final complex because a
cleaner reaction is obtained. For example, it has been found that it is better to start
with TiCl3 and then to oxidize the complex with an oxidizing agent rather than to start
with TiCl4. Using TiCl4 can result in the formation of a precipitate of TiCl3 due to
reduction by the ligand salt.The oxidation of metallocenes of tervalent transition metals, so as to
raise the oxidation state of the metal, using mild inorganic oxidizing agents have been
disclosed, for example, by Lunestra et al. who disclose the use of PbCl2 (J, Chem. Soc.,
Chem. Commun., 1990, pages 1470-1471) and in EP patent 416,815 which discloses
the use of AgCl for this purpose to form a Ti (IV) complex from a Ti (III) complex.
These oxidants, however, produce heavy metal by-products which present disposal
problems and contaminate the product due to co-precipitation of the reduced metal
with the product. On the other hand, the use of aqueous HCl as an oxidizing agent 
can result in decomposition of the metallocene product. European patent application
514,828 discloses the formation of tetravalent metallocenes by forming a tervalent
metallocene followed by oxidation of the metallocene using an organic halide. We
found that the formation of the metal complex followed by oxidation has the
disadvantage of producing some alkoxide impurity due to partial oxidation of the
metal by the preferred ether solvents prior to the treatment with the oxidizing agent.
This impurity cannot be easily separated from the metallocene product and the
presence of
