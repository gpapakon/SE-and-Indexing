<ABSTRACT>
The device comprises the following components: at least one battery (1) having high-temperature fuel cells; a first duct system (channel system) (411 - 417) for air; a surrounding casing (4) for each battery, which casing (4) is designed to be thermally insulating and in which the first duct system is at least partially integrated in the form of an air preheater; a second duct system (12, 2, 3, 30) for combustion gas as well as a third (21, 211 - 214) for exhaust gas; a secondary combustion space (11) for each battery, between the battery and the casing; and at least one prereformer (2) which is arranged in the second duct system. In this device, according to the invention, the third duct system is connected in a thermally conductive manner both to the second duct system and to the first duct system; in addition, a preheater in the form of auxiliary burners (6) which can be supplied with combustion gas is assigned to the or each prepreformer, which preheater is installed in the third duct system. The auxiliary burners are used as an aid when starting electricity-supplying operations.
