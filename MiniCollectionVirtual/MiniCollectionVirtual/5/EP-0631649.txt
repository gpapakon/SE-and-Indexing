<ABSTRACT>
A fluid pump with a rotary impeller is disclosed which comprises an electromagnetically-driven, bearing-free, seal-free rotary impeller (16) levitated by localized opposed, magnetic forces and by fluid forces, or by localized opposed magnetic forces only. Levitation by localized opposed magnetic forces alone or by a combination of magnetic and fluid forces of an impeller driven by electromagnetic forces eliminates the need for bearings and seals in the driving mechanism. This avoids the heat build-up and leakage associated with other pumping mechanisms, which can be of importance in pumping of physiological fluids such as blood. The levitating forces of the present invention are applied both axially and radially with respect to the impeller. The magnetic forces are provided by a combination of diamagnets or solenoids (70, 70', 75, 75'), opposed by permanent magnets, solenoids or electromagnets (70, 70', 75, 75'). The invention should be of use in numerous medical and non-medical applications where the benefits of impeller levitation by localized forces are apparent.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a fluid pump with a rotary impeller.
More particularly this invention relates to a fluid pump with a bearing-free,
seal-free electromagnetically-driven rotary impeller. The impeller is
levitated by a combination of axial and radial localized opposed magnetic
and fluid forces or by axial and radial magnetic forces only. The magnetic
forces used for levitation are generated by a combination of
diamagnets and permanent magnets, electromagnets or solenoids.Levitation of the impeller by such forces allows for high
efficiency in converting power into useful work. Thus, a relatively small
energy source can be used and the life of the energy source is
correspondingly extended. Moreover, use of a levitated impeller driven
by electromagnetic forces eliminates the need for driving mechanism
bearings and seals, thereby avoiding the heat build-up and leakage
attendant with other rotary pump inventions. Such considerations can be
of critical importance for pumping of physiological fluids such as blood.A large number of mechanisms for pumping fluids have
been described in the art, including, for example, peristaltic pumps,
moving diaphragm pumps, piston-type pumps, and centrifugal or rotary
pumps. Generally, a rotary pump includes a pumping chamber with inlet
and outlet ports and an impeller mounted within the pumping chamber 
for rotation about an axis. Frequently the impeller is mounted on a shaft
that extends through one or more seals and a bearing apparatus to a
rotational driving mechanism outside the pumping chamber. Rotary
pumps employing shaft-mounted impellers with shaft seals are
exemplified in the following U.S. patents: Dorman et al. U.S. Pat. No.
3,608,088; Rafferty et al. U.S. Pat. No.3,647,324; Reich et al. U.S. Pat. No.
4,135,253; Clausen et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4,589,822; Moise U.S. Pat. No.
4,704,121; and Kletschka U.S. Pat. No.4,844,707. Shaft seals are susceptible
to wear and heat build-up, which can lead to leakage and, in the case of
blood pumps, to thrombogenic (clot-forming) problems, denaturation of
proteins, and embolic phenomena and the like.Other pump inventions employ liquid or hydrostatic
bearings to reduce heat build-up and/or to dissipate heat and to reduce
frictional forces in rotation of the shaft and/or impeller. In these
inventions liquid or gas is forced into narrow clearances between the shaft
and various bearing assemblies or between the impeller and the impeller
housing. The relatively thin fluid or gas films generated in these
inventions are nevertheless
