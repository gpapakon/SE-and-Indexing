<ABSTRACT>
An ultrasonic device having an acoustic transducer 
(10) with a lamination (22) of parallel integrated 

circuit chips (24-38) having active circuitry (60, 62, 66 
and 68). A backing member (16) made of a material for 

attenuating acoustic waves provides Z-axis conduction of 
signals from the parallel integrated circuit chips to 

individual piezoelectric elements (12). Preferably, each 
piezoelectric element is operatively associated with a 

particular circuit that is within the acoustic shadow of 
the element, so that the lamination of chips does not add 

to the cross sectional area of the transducer. The integrated 
circuit chips are coterminus at first edges to 

provide a planar contact surface having a pad grid array 
of contact pads (44) for connection with conductors (18) 

extending through the backing member. In one embodiment, 
the piezoelectric elements provide a two-dimensional array 

of elements that corresponds to the pad grid array. 
Circuitry on the integrated circuit chips can include 

protective diodes, preamplifiers and one or more multiplexers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to 
acoustic transducers and more particularly to signal 
conditioning and interconnecting schemes for ultrasonic 
transducer arrays. A diagnostic ultrasonic imaging system for 
medical use forms images of tissues of a human body by 
electrically exciting an acoustic transducer element or an 
array of acoustic transducer elements to generate short 
ultrasonic pulses that are caused to travel into the body. 
Echoes from the tissues are received by the acoustic 
transducer element or elements and are converted into 
electrical signals. The electrical signals are amplified 
and used to form a cross sectional image of the tissues. 
Echographic examination is also used outside of the 
medical field. Two areas of concern in the fabrication of 
ultrasonic imaging systems are the means for achieving 
electrical interconnections and the means for conditioning 
signals. Regarding signal conditioning, circuitry for 
preamplification, protection and control is ideally 
located on-board the transducer head that is brought into 
contact with the human body or other object of interest. 
However, the transducer head should be a compact, lightweight 
device that is easily manipulated. Including 
preamplification and protection circuitry for each transducer 
element of a two-dimensional array of elements is 
not easily accomplished. Electrical interconnections of components within 
the transducer head are complicated by the presence of a 
backing layer. The individual transducer 
elements acoustically convert input signals to wave energy 
that is directed both forwardly and rearwardly. An energy 
absorptive backing layer prevents reflections of the  
 
rearwardly directed energy from reducing the ultrasonic 
image resolution. While the reflections would improve the 
power output of the system, the reflections would widen 
the acoustic output pulses, thereby adversely affecting 
resolution. The backing layer does not present problems to 
electrical interconnections within transducer heads having 
a single element. However, the interconnection scheme 
becomes an important concern for linear arrays of 
transducer elements. The concern is increased for transducer 
heads having two-dimensional arrays of more than 
three rows and columns of elements, since many of the 
elements will not have an exposed edge that accommodates 
electrical connection. U.S. Pat. No. 4,825,115 to Kawabe et al. 
describes a method of providing excitation energy to a 
center column of elements. Bonding wires
