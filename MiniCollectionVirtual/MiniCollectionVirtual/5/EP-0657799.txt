<ABSTRACT>
A computer system includes a graphical user interface that provides 
a window display of a notebook metaphor having sheets that are bound 

together by notebook rings that can be opened and closed to permit 
adding, removing, and changing the order of the notebook sheets. The 

contents of the notebook metaphor are displayed as a stack of sheets. 
The notebook metaphor display includes a page-forward icon, a page-backward 

icon, and a page-release icon. User interaction with the page-forward 
icon is responded to by displaying a next sheet of the open 

notebook, user interaction with the page-backward icon is responded to by 
displaying a previous sheet of the open notebook, and user interaction 

with the page-release icon is responded to by displaying opened notebook 
rings. When the notebook rings are opened, the user is permitted to hold 

the top sheet of the stacked sheets and move it about in the window 
display. In this way, the interface in accordance with the invention 

permits a user to directly manipulate the sheets in the notebook 
metaphor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a computer system/user interface 
having structured data objects displayed as object metaphors that can be 
manipulated by the user. A graphical user interface (GUI) is a type of computer system/user 
interface that provides structured data objects displayed as icons or 
object metaphors that can be controlled by users to manipulate the 
underlying data objects and initiate system actions. The object 
metaphors are displayed on a workstation display device and are 
manipulated with a workstation keyboard and an input device, such as a 
track ball or mouse device. A GUI provides a more efficient, user-friendly 
interface with which a user can operate a computer system 
workstation. A GUI also permits many applications to share the 
workstation display screen and thereby permits a user to easily move and 
share data between multiple applications or data structures. The movement and sharing of data between applications and data 
structures is possible because the GUI provides a blank area display 
called a desktop, in which are displayed one or more working areas called 
windows. Data entered by the user, as well as icons or object metaphors, 
can be displayed in the windows and can be manipulated by the user. In 
general, each window has several icons with which a user can interact to 
manipulate and change the display and to initiate system actions. The 
size of the windows can be expanded so that one window fills the desktop 
or can be reduced so that several windows can be simultaneously displayed 
on the desktop. Windows can be closed and opened to gain access to 
applications and data. A common type of GUI provides a window display representing readily 
identifiable office object metaphors that a user can manipulate after the 
user has designated the metaphor by moving a display cursor over the 
metaphor with a display mouse device and then pressing or "clicking" a 
display mouse device button. For example, in a GUI, a file folder 
metaphor (a two-dimensional representation of a file folder) can 
represent a data object containing one or more documents. A user can 
open the file folder metaphor and display its contents, which can be 
document data objects represented by document icons, by moving the  
 
display cursor over the file folder metaphor and clicking the mouse 
button while the cursor is positioned over the metaphor. The computer 
system responds to the button clicking on the file folder by changing the 
file folder metaphor, such as by replacing the working
