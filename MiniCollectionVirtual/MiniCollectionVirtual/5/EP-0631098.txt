<ABSTRACT>
A continuous dryer (3) for plane-shaped articles, in particular for coated inner layers or printed circuit boards, is described which has a drying chamber (4) in which the plane-shaped article to be dried is exposed to a forced air flow (L) while it is transported along a transport path (P) from an entrance (5) to an exit (6) of the drying chamber (4) by transport means preferably acting on its longitudinal margins. The drying chamber (4) is provided with an inlet (7) for supply air (Z) and with an outlet (8) for exhaust air (A). Arranged above and below the transport path (P) of the plane-shaped article are infrared radiators (9), the radiation of which acts directly on the coated article and which in addition form a heat source for the forced air flow (L). The air flow (L) in the drying chamber (4) is forced in the opposite direction to the transport direction (D) of the plane-shaped article and essentially parallel to the transport plane (P). A coating apparatus (1) is also described which incorporates such a continuous dryer (3).

A continuous drier for board-shaped piece material, especially for coated in-layers of
printed circuit boards, comprising a drying chamber (4), in which the board-shaped piece

material to be dried is exposed to a guided air stream (L) while being transported along a
transport path (P) from an entrance (5) to an exit (6) of the drying chamber (4) by transport

means acting preferably at its longitudinal edges, and comprising an inlet (7) and an outlet
(8) for the air (L), infrared radiators being arranged above the transport path of the board-shaped

piece material and the air stream being guided in the drying chamber counter to the
transport direction of the board-shaped piece material and substantially parallel to the

transport plane,

wherein

there are arranged above and below the transport path (P) of the board-shaped piece
material infrared radiators (9) the radiation of which acts directly on the piece material in

order to dry it and which, at the same time, form a heat source for the guided air stream (L),
the air stream (L) in the drying chamber (4) is substantially laminar, and
the infrared radiators (9) arranged along the transport path (P) above and below the same
are assembled into groups and can be operated in such a manner that the drying chamber

(4) comprises several, preferably three, heating zones (I, II, III) along the transport path (P),
each of which heating zones comprises a group of infrared radiators (9) having a different

surface temperature, the heating zone (I) having the lowest surface temperature of the
infrared radiators (9) being closest to the entrance (5) of the drying chamber (4), whilst the

heating zone (III) having the highest surface temperature of the infrared radiators (9) is the
last heating zone before the exit (6).
An apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the infrared radiators (9) are arranged at constant
distances from one another along the transport path (P), the distance of two infrared

radiators (9) from each other being from approximately 70 mm to approximately 130 mm,
preferably approximately 100 mm.
An apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the air outlet (8) is designed to remove a
greater quantity of air than is supplied at the air inlet (7). 
An apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the inlet (7) for the incoming air (Z) is arranged
in the region of the exit (6) of the drying chamber (4), whereas the outlet (8) for the outgoing

air (A) is arranged in the region of the entrance (5) of the drying chamber (4), and wherein
flow rate regulators (12; 14) for the air are provided at the inlet (7) and at the outlet (8).
An apparatus according to claim 4, wherein a clean-room filter (10) is arranged in the inlet
(7) for the incoming air (Z).
An apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the transport path (P) of the board-shaped
material inside the drying chamber (4) extends substantially horizontally.
An apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the drying chamber (4) is divided into three
regions, a pre-heating and mixing region (V), which is arranged immediately downstream of

the entrance (5), followed by a heating region (H), which is optionally divided into the three
heating zones (I, II, III), and a cooling region (K), which is arranged before the exit (6) of the

drying chamber (4).
A coating installation for board-shaped piece material, especially for in-layers or printed
circuit boards, comprising a coating station (2), in which the board-shaped piece material is

coated on one or both sides with photoresist or the like, and an adjoining drying station (3), in
which the photoresist is dried and solvent contained in the photoresist is evaporated off and

transported away, wherein the drying station (3) is a continuous drier according to any one of
claims 1 to 7.
A coating installation according to claim 8, wherein the coating station (2) comprises a
coating cabin (20) having an air inlet opening (23) and an entry opening (21) and an opposite

exit opening (22) for the board-shaped material to be coated, the exit opening (22) leading
directly into the entrance (5) to the drying chamber (4).
A coating installation according to claim 9, wherein the coating station (2) is equipped
with a roller coating device (24) comprising one coating roller arranged above and one 

coating roller arranged below the transport path (P) of the board-shaped piece material,
between which the board-shaped piece material can be transported for coating with

photoresist or the like while being held at its longitudinal edges by transport means provided
in the coating station (2).
A coating installation according to claim 9, wherein the outlet opening (8) provided in the
continuous drier (3) for the outgoing air (A) is at the same time the air outlet opening for the

coating cabin (20).
A coating installation according to claim 11, wherein the volume of outgoing air (A)
removed at the outlet open
ing (8) approximately corresponds to the air volumes of the drying
air (L) passed through the drying chamber (4) and the air (F) introduced into the coating

cabin (20).
A coating installation according to claim 12, wherein the air inlet opening (23) of the
