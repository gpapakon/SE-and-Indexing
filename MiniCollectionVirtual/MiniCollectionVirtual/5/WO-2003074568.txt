<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method for producing patient specific anti-cancer antibodies using a novel paradigm of screening. By segregating the anti-cancer antibodies using cancer cell sytotoxicity as an end point, the process makes possible the production of anti-cancer antibodies customized for the individual patient that can be used for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes. The invention further relates to the process by which the antibodies are made and to their methods of use. The antibodies can be made specifically for one tumor derived from a particular patient and are selected on the basis of their cancer cell cytotoxicity and simultaneous lack of toxicity for non-cancerous cells. The antibodies can be used in aid of staging and diagnosis of a cancer, and can be used to treat tumor metastases. The anti-cancer antibodies can be conjugated to red blood cells obtained from that patient and re-infused for treatment of metastases based upon the recognition that metastatic cancers are usually well vascularized and the delivery of anti-cancer antibodies by red blood cells can have the effect of concentrating the antibodies at the site of the tumor.

<DESCRIPTION>
 INDIVIDUALIZED ANTI-CANCER ANTIBODIESField of the Invention: This invention relates to the production of anti- cancer antibodies customized for the individual patient that can be used for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes . The invention further relates to the process by which the antibodies are made and to their methods of use.Background of the Invention: Each individual who presents with cancer is unique and has a cancer that is as different from other cancers as that person's identity. Despite this, current therapy treats all patients with the same type of cancer, at the same stage, in the same way. At least 30% of these patients will fail the first line therapy, thus leading to further rounds of treatment and the increased probability of treatment failure, metastases, and ultimately, death. A superior approach to treatment would be the customization of therapy for the particular individual. The only current therapy which lends itself to customization is surgery. Chemotherapy and radiation treatment can not be tailored to the patient, and surgery by itself, in most cases is inadequate for producing cures . With the advent of monoclonal antibodies, the possibility of developing methods for customized therapy became more realistic since each antibody can be directed to a single epitope . Furthermore, it is possible to produce a combination of antibodies that are directed to the constellation of epitopes that uniquely define a particular individual's tumor. Having recognized that a significant difference between cancerous and normal cells is that cancerous cells contain antigens that are specific to transformed cells, the scientific community has long held that monoclonal 

antibodies can be designed to specifically target transformed cells by binding specifically to these cancer antigens; thus giving rise to the belief that monoclonal antibodies can serve as "Magic Bullets" to eliminate cancer cells. At the present time, however, the cancer patient usually has few options of treatment. The regimented approach to cancer therapy has produced improvements in global survival and morbidity rates. However, to the particular individual, these improved statistics do not necessarily correlate with an improvement in their personal situation. Thus, if a methodology was put forth which enabled the practitioner to treat each tumor independently of other patients in the same cohort, this would permit the unique approach of tailoring therapy to just that one person. Such a course of therapy would, ideally,

CLAIMS What is claimed is:
Claim 1. A method for the production of patient specific anti-cancer antibodies which are useful in treating a cancerous disease comprising: obtaining a tissue sample from a particular individual; manufacturing antibodies directed against cells of said tissue sample; subjecting said manufactured antibodies to a cytotoxicity assay designed to produce a subset of antibodies which express an enhanced degree of cytotoxicity directed toward cancer cells; whereby said subset of antibodies defines a group of patient specific anti-cancer antibodies characterized as being cytotoxic to cancer cells and relatively benign toward normal cells .
Claim 2. The patient specific anti-cancer antibodies or fragments thereof produced in accordance with the method of claim 1.
Claim 3. The patient specific anti-cancer antibodies or fragments thereof in accordance with claim 2 wherein the cytotoxicity of said antibodies is mediated through antibody dependent cellular toxicity.
Claim 4. The patient specific anti-cancer antibodies or fragments thereof in accordance with claim 2 wherein the cytotoxicity of said antibodies is mediated through complement dependent cellular toxicity.
Claim 5. The patient specific anti-cancer antibodies or fragments thereof in accordance with claim 2 wherein the cytotoxicity of said antibodies is mediated through catalyzing of the hydrolysis of cellular chemical bonds. 


 Claim 6. The patient specific anti-cancer antibodies or fragments thereof in accordance with claim 2 wherein the cytotoxicity of said antibodies is mediated through producing an immune response against putative cancer antigens residing on tumor cells.
Claim 7. The patient specific anti-cancer antibodies or fragments thereof in accordance with claim 2 wherein the cytotoxicity of said antibodies is mediated through targeting of cell membrane proteins to interfere with their function.
Claim 8. The patient specific anti-cancer antibodies or fragments thereof in accordance with claim 2 wherein the cytotoxicity of said antibodies is mediated through production of a conformational change in a cellular protein effective to produce a signal to initiate cell- killing.
Claim 9. A method for treating a patient suffering from a cancerous disease comprising: administering to said patient the patient specific antji-cancer antibodies of claim 2, wherein said anti-cancer antibodies are in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant and are administered in an amount effective to mediate treatment of said cancerous disease.
Claim 10. The method of claim 9, wherein the patient specific anti-cancer antibody is a humanized antibody.
Claim 11. A method for treating a patient suffering from a cancerous disease comprising: conjugating said patient specific anti-cancer antibodies of claim 2 with a member selected from the group consisting of toxins, enzymes, radioactive compounds, and hematogenous cells; and 


 administering conjugated antibodies to said patient; wherein said anti-cancer antibodies are in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant and are administered in an amount effective to mediate treatment of said cancerous disease.
Claim 12. The method of claim 11, wherein the patient specific anti-cancer antibody is a humanized antibody.
