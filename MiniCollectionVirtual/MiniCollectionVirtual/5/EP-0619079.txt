<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed to provide feed additives 
which permit effective absorption of biologically active 

substances by ruminants. A biologically active substance is 
coated with a composition comprising at least a first substance 

selected from the group consisting of hardened vegetable fats 
and oils, hardened animal fats and oils, fatty acid esters and 

phospholipids, and at least a second substance selected from 
the group consisting of (i) an enzyme being capable of 

hydrolysing at least one of said first substance and (ii) an 
activator of an enzyme secreted from a post-abomasum digestive 

organ of the ruminant and being capable of hydrolysing at least 
one of said substances A) and a mixture of (i) and (ii) with 

the outermost surface portion of the coating layer containing 
substantially no enzyme and/or activator of the enzyme.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a feed additive composition
for ruminants. More particularly, it relates to a feed additive
composition for ruminants in which biologically active
substances are coated with a coating composition which is
stable in a first stomach (rumen) of ruminants and allows the
release of biologically active substances in post-abomasum
digestive organs, thereby permitting digestion and absorption
of the biologically active substances into the post-abomasum
digestive organs.In ruminants such as cattle and sheep, a substantial part of
biologically active substances such as amino acids and vitamins
is, if directly administered orally, degraded by microorganisms
in the rumen and is not effectively used. In this respect,
ruminal by-pass pharmaceuticals for ruminants are important in
the field of, for example, feeds, nutrients and animal drugs
for the ruminants which protect these biologically active
substances from degradation by the microorganisms in the rumen
and allow digestion and absorption thereof through the post-abomasum
digestive organs.It has been proposed for a long time to coat feed additives for
ruminants containing biologically active substances with fatty
acids having 12 or more carbon atoms, hardened animal/vegetable
oils etc. Though particles coated with such fat or oil show
improved protection in the rumen, it is difficult to dissolve
the biologically active substance in the post-abomasum
digestive organs.In this respect, there has been proposed a method of adding
another substance enhancing dissolution. In one case a biologically
active substance is dispersed in protective substances,
such as fats and oils and the mixture is granulated and in
another case the biologically active substance is coated with
protective substances, such as fats and oils. As a method of dispersing biologically active substances in a
protective substance, for example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open
No. 60-168351 proposes a method of granulating biologically
active substances, calcium carbonate in an amount of 20%, by
weight, or more along with aliphatic monocarboxylic acids
having 14 or more carbon atoms and hardened fats and oils etc.
in an amount of 10%, by weight, or more. In addition, Japanese
Patent Publication No. 59-10780 proposes a method of dispersing
30-50 % by weight of a biologically active substance in a
protective substance consisting of 10-35 %, by weight, of a
salt of an aliphatic monocarboxylic acid having 14 to 22 carbon
atoms or of ricinoleic acid and balance of an aliphatic
monoc

phospholipids, and at least a substance B) selected from the
group consisting of (i) an enzyme being capable of hydrolysing

digestive organ of the ruminant and being capable of
hydrolysing at least one of said substances A) and a mixture of

(i) and (ii), wherein

the outermost surface portion of the coating layer
contains no substance B) or contains substance B together

with an inhibitor.

to Claim 1 characterized in that said substance B) comprises at

least one enzyme selected from the group consisting of lipase,
phospholipase, esterase or a mixture thereof.
