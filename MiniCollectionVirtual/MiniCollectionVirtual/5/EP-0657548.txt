<ABSTRACT>
Strand Displacement Amplification for 
amplification of nucleic acid target sequences 
in situ
 in 
cells in suspension, on slides or in tissues. Excellent 

specimen morphology is preserved, and either DNA targets, 
or RNA targets, or both may be selectively amplified. 
In 
situ
 amplification by SDA is comparable with 
immunochemical techniques, so that both amplification of 

target sequences and immunological staining can be 
performed on the same specimen.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to amplification of
nucleic acids and in particular to amplification of nucleic
acids in morphologically intact cells.Nucleic acid amplification techniques have
provided powerful tools for detection and analysis of
small amounts of nucleic acids. The extreme sensitivity
of such methods has lead to attempts to develop them for
early diagnosis of infectious and genetic diseases,
isolation of genes for analysis, and detection of
specific nucleic acids in forensic medicine. Nucleic
acid amplification techniques can be grouped according to
the temperature requirements of the procedure. The
polymerase chain reaction (PCR), ligase chain reaction
(LCR) and transcription-based amplification require
repeated cycling of the reaction between high (85°C-100°C)
and low (30°C - 40°C) temperatures to regenerate
single stranded target molecules for amplification. In
contrast, methods such as Strand Displacement
Amplification (SDA), self-sustained sequence replication
(3SR) and the Qβ replicase system are isothermal
reactions which can be performed at a constant low
temperature (usually about 30-40°C).One of the best known nucleic acid amplification
methods is the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). This
method is described by R. K. Saiki, et al. (1985. Science
230, 1350-1354) and in U.S. Patent No. 4,683,195, U.S.
Patent No. 4,683,202 and U.S. Patent No. 4,800,159.
Briefly, to amplify a target sequence using the PCR, two 
primers complementary to sequences flanking the target
sequence are hybridized (one to each of the opposite
complementary strands) and extended, using the target
sequence as a template, by addition of
deoxyribonucleotides and a DNA polymerase. After
extension, the temperature of the reaction is raised to
separate the newly-synthesized strand from the template,
then lowered to reanneal the primers and repeat the
extension process. Due to the characteristic cycling of
the reaction temperature, the PCR requires the use of a
heat stable polymerase such as Taq polymerase.In contrast, Strand Displacement Amplification
(SDA) is an isothermal method of nucleic acid
amplification in which extension of primers, displacement
of single stranded extension products, annealing of
primers to the extension products (or the original target
sequence) and subsequent extension of the primers occurs
concurrently in the reaction mix. This is in contrast to
the PCR, in which the steps of the reaction occur in
discrete phases or cycles as a result of the temperature
constraints of the reaction. SDA
