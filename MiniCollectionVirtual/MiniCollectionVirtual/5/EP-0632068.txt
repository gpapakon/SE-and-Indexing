<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
preparing an absorbent resin, more specifically relates to
a process for preparing an absorbent resin which exhibits
excellent properties including its gel stability,
diffusivity of aqueous liquid and permeability to aqueous
liquid, suitable for use in sanitary goods.Recently, an absorbent resin is widely used in
sanitary goods such as paper diaper, sanitary napkin,
etc., for the purpose of absorbing liquid.Examples of the conventionally known absorbent resins
includes: a partially neutralized crosslinked polymer of 
polyacrylic acid (Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication
No. 84304/1980 (Tokukaisho 55-84304), Japanese Unexamined
Patent Publication No. 108407/1980 (Tokukaisho 55-108407)
and Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 133413/1980
(Tokukaisho 55-133413)); a hydrolyzed polymer of
starch-acrylonitrile (Japanese Unexamined Patent
Publication No. 43995/1971 (Tokukaisho 46-43995)); a
neutralized graft polymer of starch-acrylic acid (Japanese
Unexamined Patent Publication No. 125468/1976 (Tokukaisho
51-125468)); a saponified copolymer of vinyl
acetate-acrylic ester (Japanese Unexamined Patent
Publication No. 14689/1977 (Tokukaisho 52-14689)); a
hydrolyzed copolymer of acrylonitrile or of acrylamide
(Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 15959/1978
(Tokukaisho 53-15959)); a crosslinked polymer of cationic
monomer (Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No.
154709/1983 (Tokukaisho 53-154709) and Japanese Unexamined
Patent Publication No. 154710/1983 (Tokukaisho
58-154710)).Among the above-listed crosslinked polymers, a
crosslinked polymer obtained by polymerizing a hydrophilic
unsaturated monomer having at least one carboxyl group
such as acrylic acid in the presence of a crosslinking
agent is the most common material for the absorbent resin, 
because the raw material for the above polymer is available
at low price, while exhibiting excellent absorbent
properties without the problem of putrefaction.The absorbent resin desirably exhibits the following
properties when it is in contact with aqueous liquid: high
magnifier and rate of absorbency; an excellent stability
of its swollen gel; high diffusivity of and permeability
to aqueous liquid, a strong suction power for sucking
aqueous liquid from the material containing aqueous
liquid, etc.Recently, still thinner sanitary goods of higher
quality have been demanded, and an amount of use of the
absorbent resin has been increasing. Thus, an absorbent
resin which exhibits improved gel stability,
