<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a soluble wound dressing having a wound facing layer comprising a lyophilized foam and an active ingredient, a method of using said dressing, and an improved method of manufacturing said wound facing layer using a continuous, enclosed mixing device capable of operating under pressure. The wound facing layers of the invention have a dissolution time of at least about 2 hours, and preferably at least about 24 hours, and can provide for the sustained and/or controlled release of an active ingredient for up to about 24 hours.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to dressings that are useful for
administering active ingredients to the wound. More
particularly, it relates to wound dressings having water-soluble
wound facing layers comprising lyophilized foams;
methods of using such dressings for the controlled or
sustained delivery of active ingredients to wounds; and
methods for their manufacture. The wound dressings of the
present invention can provide for the controlled and
sustained release of an active ingredient for at least
about 24 hours.Chronic cutaneous wounds and ulcers represent a
significant portion of hospital admissions, and the
healing of these wounds is typically a costly and time-consuming
endeavor that can take weeks and even months.
Dressings that provide for the controlled or sustained
release of active ingredients to accelerate healing are an
integral part of the treatment regime.Generally, four types of dressings are used to treat
chronic wounds; namely, films, gels, hydrocolloids and
foams. Dressings comprising films and gels are typically
used to treat moderately exudative wounds, whereas
hydrocolloid and foam-containing dressings are used to
treat heavily exudative wounds. Ideally, such dressings
should reduce the amount of care required to manage the
injury and the cost of the care. In addition, the
treatment regime should minimize the patient's pain and
suffering.There are several disadvantages associated with the 
present use of foams in wound dressings. Such foams
typically dissolve too quickly and do not possess the
requisite tactile and structural properties.For example, in U.S. Patent No. 4,292,972, Pawelchak et
al. disclose a lyophilized foam sponge product containing
sodium carboxymethylcellulose, pectin, gelatin and a
pharmaceutical. The colloidal dispersions described by
Pawelchak do not aerate well, and the resulting foams are
stiff, brittle and possess poor structural integrity. In
addition, Pawelchak's foams dissolve in less than about
five hours. Another disadvantage is that it is not
possible to control the dosage delivery rates and
dissolution times of foams using Pawelchak's method of
manufacture.In U.S. Patent No. 4,642,903, Davies discloses the use of
freeze-dried foams for dispensing a variety of active
ingredients. Davies' foams are designed to dissolve
virtually instantaneously. As with Pawelchak, it is not
possible to control the various properties of Davies'
freeze-dried foams using Davies' process.Japanese Kokai Patent Application No. 80-71532 describes
a method for manufacturing
