<ABSTRACT>
A filter element includes a bundle (1) of hollow 
fibres made of a first polyolefin. The bundle (1) has at 

least one end sealed with a second polyolefin (2) having an 
average molecular weight in the range of 1,000 to 16,000. 

The filter element is produced by a method including the 
steps of fusing the second polyolefin (2) having a fusion 

point lower than that of the first polyolefin (1), 
attaching the fused second polyolefin (2) to at least one 

end of the bundle, allowing the attached second polyolefin 
to set, thereby providing the bundle with a sealed portion, 

and cutting off the leading end of the sealed portion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for the production of
a filter element,
which is highly resistant to solvents and comprises a
bundle of hollow fibres having at least one end sealed with
a thermoplastic resin material.In conventional filter elements of this kind, at least
one end of a bundle of hollow fibres is sealed with
urethane adhesive. Use of such urethane adhesive leads to
good workability when providing the at least one end of the
bundle with a sealed portion. A filter module having such
a conventional filter element contained in a housing
exhibits sufficient durability to water. However, it is
inferior in durability to an aqueous alcohol solution or
organic solvents such as alcohol.In view of the above, filter elements each comprising
a bundle of hollow fibres which has at least one end sealed
with a thermoplastic resin material resistant to solvents
have recently been developed.Such filter elements are disclosed, for example, in
Japanese Patent Non-examined Publications No. 1-218605, No.
3-245826 and No. 4-63117.However, the use of a thermoplastic resin has
disadvantages in (1) that the step of forming a sealed
portion requires a treating temperature higher than in the
case of using urethane adhesive in order to obtain fluidity
of the resin, resulting in thermal deformation of the
hollow fibres and possible destruction of the inside
diameters of the hollow fibres depending on a combination
with the material of which the hollow fibres are made, (2)
that since thermoplastic resin has viscosity higher than
that of urethane adhesive, it fails to propagate over the
entire spaces between the adjacent hollow fibres even if it
should gain fluidity, resulting in an incomplete sealed 
portion, and (3) that thermoplastic resin encounters volume
shrinkage larger than that of urethane adhesive during its
setting, resulting in an incomplete sealed portion having
crazing and/or cavities.The first cited Japanese Publication discloses a
method for the formation of a sealed portion of a bundle of
hollow fibres by filling the inside of the ends of the
hollow fibres with calcium carbonate so as not to induce
thermal deformation, then sealing the spaces between the
adjacent ends of the hollow fibres with fine particles of
thermoplastic resin the same as the thermoplastic resin of
which the hollow fibres are made, and fusion bonding the
ends of the hollow fibres. This method requires the steps
of removing the calcium carbonate by dissolving it in
concentrated hydrochloric acid which will constitute waste

<CLAIMS>
A method for the production of a filter element (9)
including a bundle (1) of fibres made of a first polyolefin

having a melting point, said method comprising the steps of
(a) melting in a mould (3) a second polyolefin having an

average molecular weight in the range of 1000 to 16000 and
a melting point lower than the melting point of said first

polyolefin; (b) immersing at least one end of said bundle
(1) into the molten second polyolefin (2) in said mould to

attach the molten second polyolefin to said at least one
end of said bundle; (c) removing said bundle from said

mould; (d) allowing the attached second polyolefin to set,
thereby providing said bundle with a sealed portion (10);

(e) melting in a further mould (7) a further quantity of
said second polyolefin; (f) immersing said sealed portion

(10) of said bundle into said separately prepared molten
second polyolefin (5) contained in said further mould (7);

(g) allowing said sealed portion to set; and (h) cutting
off a leading end of said sealed portion.
A method according to claim 1, characterised in that
said further mould (7) further contains molten ordinary

polyolefin admixed with said separately prepared molten
second polyolefin (5).
A method according to claim 2, characterised in that
said ordinary polyolefin is low-density polyethylene,

linear low-density polyethylene, high-density polyethylene
or polypropylene.
A method according to any preceding claim,
characterised in that said first polyolefin is

polypropylene or high-density polyethylene.
A method according to any preceding claim,
characterised in that the difference between the melting

point of said first polyolefin and that of said second
polyolefin falls within 30Â°C.
