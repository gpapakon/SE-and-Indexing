<ABSTRACT>
In the first step of the process, dimethyldichlorosilane is reacted with water present in hydrochloric acid to give a crude hydrolysate comprising cyclic and linear, chlorine-containing polydimethylsiloxanes and gaseous hydrogen chloride, and in a second step, the crude hydrolysate is, in order to reduce the chlorine content, treated with steam to form hydrochloric acid, hydrochloric acid formed in the second step being employed in the first step.

Process for preparing polydimethylsiloxanes which 
comprises 


in a first step, reacting dimethyldichlorosilane with 
water present in hydrochloric acid to give a crude 

hydrolysate comprising cyclic and linear, chlorine-containing 
polydimethylsiloxanes and gaseous hydrogen 

chloride and 
in a second step, treating the crude hydrolysate with 
steam to reduce the chlorine content and form hydrochloric 

acid, 
where the hydrochloric acid formed in the second step is 
used in the first step. 
Process according to Claim 1, wherein the 
pressure of the hydrogen chloride gas obtained is from 

0.15 to 0.5 MPa. 
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, wherein the 
amount of water used in the second step is at most such 

that the water of the hydrochloric acid formed is 
completely reacted in the first step. 
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
wherei
n the treatment of the crude hydrolysate with steam 
in the second step is carried out in a column. 
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 4, 
wherein the treatment of the crude hydrolysate with steam 

in the second step is carried out in at least two stages. 
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 5, 
wherein both steps are carried out fully continuously.
