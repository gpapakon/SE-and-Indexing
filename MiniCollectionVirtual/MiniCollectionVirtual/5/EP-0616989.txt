<ABSTRACT>
The patent describes waterproofing (hydrophobicising) agents for mineral building materials based on aqueous emulsions of organosilanes and/or organosiloxane resins containing reactive groups, in which silanes/siloxanes the dispersed phase has a mean particle size of from 0.55 to 1.1  mu m and a particle size distribution width of less than 1.3.

<CLAIMS>
Waterproofing agent for mineral building materials,
based on aqueous emulsions of organosilanes and/or

organosiloxane resins containing reactive groups,
characterised in that the disperse phase has an

average particle size of 0.3 to 1.1 Âµm and a particle-size
distribution range of less than 1.3.
Waterproofing agent according to claim 1,
characterised in that the emulsion contains 5 to

70 wt.% of a mixture, in which the ratio of
alkylalkoxysilane (I, Ia) to alkylalkoxysiloxane (II)
