<ABSTRACT>
In a method for decomposition of hydrocarbons for the production of hydrogen and carbon black, the feed stock is passed through a plasma torch, which causes a pyrolytic decomposition of the feed stock. The feed stock is transported through the plasma torch (A) in a cooled lead-in tube (1) and undergoes a first heating in an area in the immediate vicinity of the plasma flame. In the area immediately below the plasma flame a mixing of the hydrocarbon material and the plasma gas occurs, the temperature being increased to decomposition temperature for the raw material. In this area free hydrogen and dehydrogenated carbon material are produced in the form of drops of liquid. The material thereby produced is passed on to one or more subsequent stages where the final and complete decomposition of the hydrocarbons to carbon black and hydrogen occurs. In this area further raw material may be added which causes quenching and reacts with the already produced carbon black. An increase is thereby caused in particle size, density and amount produced without further energy supply, whereafter the products produced are expelled and separated and hot gas may be transported in a return pipe to the torch, in order to further increase the energy yield.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a method for decomposition of 
hydrocarbons for the production of hydrogen and carbon black, 
the method employing a pyrolytic process with a torch in a 
reaction chamber. The traditional production methods for carbon black consist in 
a combustion of hydrocarbons by the supply of air. The quality 
achieved will be dependent on the supply of air or oxygen and 
the use of different amounts of oxygen in a surplus or a 
deficit. In the known methods substantial parts of the hydrocarbons 
are consumed in supplying sufficient energy for the 
decomposition, thus realizing a relatively low yield of carbon 
black. In addition to a low yield the combustion process will 
cause environmental pollution, since both carbon dioxides and 
nitrogen oxides will be produced. The waste gases from the 
processes will be able to be used only as fuel gas. For the decomposition of hydrocarbons other pyrolytic methods 
have also been used in which plasma torches have been utilized, 
but it has not been possible to use these methods for 
continuous production due to deposits on the electrodes, which 
have led to stoppages in the process and expensive cleaning 
procedures. Carbon which is formed by pyrolysis of hydrocarbons can be 
divided into two different qualities, viz. carbon black and 
coke (pyrolytic carbon). Carbon black is light and soft with 
low density and is produced in the gas phase, while coke is 
harder, has high density and is produced on surfaces with relatively 
low temperatures, normally lower than 1100°C. From US 4 101 639 is known a pyrolytic method for the production 
of carbon black where water vapour is injected into the 
plasma stream radially and tangentially with respect to the 
walls of the reaction chamber. The water vapour will avoid the 
formation of pyrolytic carbon and graphite in the carbon black.  
 The tangential stream of water vapour will protect the walls 
of the reaction chamber from high temperatures of the plasma 
stream and prevent deposition of condensed carbon on the walls. 
The main component of the gasous by-product is hydrogen and 
after appropriate purification this hydrogen may be utilized as 
an end product in chemical industry. From DD 211 457 is known a method and an apparatus for the 
production of carbon black and hydrogen. A part of the hydrogen 
is recycled and is used as plasma gas. Feed stock in the form 
of hydrocarbons as liquid or gas is introduced radially via 
nozzles in one end of the reaction chamber and is mixed into a 
plasma stream at a

<CLAIMS>
A method for decomposition of hydrocarbons exclusively 
intended for the production of hydrogen and carbon black,
 
wherein preheated feed stock is passed through a plasma torch 

and wherein the plasma gas is recycled hydrogen, which causes a 
pyrolytic decomposition of the feed stock and wherein the 

reaction takes place in a reaction area,
 
characterized in that the hydrocarbon feed stock is transported 

through the plasma torch in a temperature controlled lead-in 
tube so that it has a temperature lower than 1000°C when it 

leaves the lead-in tube,
 
that the feed stock undergoes a first uniform heating in an 

area in the immediate vicinity of the plasma flame, the feed 
stock being fed in centrally in relation to the plasma torch's 

flame,
 
that in an area immediately behind the plasma flame, there 

occurs a mixing of the hydrocarbon material and the plasma gas, 
the temperature being increased to over 1600°C which is the 

decomposition temperature for the raw material, and that free 
hydrogen and dehydrogenated carbon material in the form of 

drops of liquid are formed in this area, that the material 
formed thereby is passed on to one or more subsequent stages 

where the temperature is kept between 1200°C and 1600°C and 
where the final and complete decomposition of the hydrocarbons 

to carbon black and hydrogen is performed, that further raw 
materials are added in this area which cause quenching and 

react with the already produced carbon black, thereby causing 
an increase in the particle size, density and amount produced 

without further energy supply, whereafter the products created 
are discharged and separated and that hot gas may be transported 

in a return pipe to the torch in order to further 
increase the energy yield, and
 
that the temperatures in the reaction area are controlled by 

adjusting the feed rates for reactant and plasma gas and/or by 
regulating the energy supply to the plasma torch and/or by 

adjusting the pressure in the reaction area, thus enabling the  
 

quality of the carbon black created to be controlled to achieve 
the desired quality.

characterized in that in the final stage of the method extra plasma torches are 

used in order to control the temperature. 
An apparatus for use in the implementation of the method according to 
claim 1 for decomposition of hydrocarbons, comprising a plasma torch (A)

which leads to the plasma torch (A).
