<ABSTRACT>
The present invention concerns a technique to transmit several broadcast signal
using only one irradiating system for the entire signals ensemble. To reach such

goal this invention is based on a suitable arrangement of the signals to feed the
final amplification chain and eventually on a method to compensate the non-linear

distortions introduced by the amplification chain on the said signal.
In its easiest form the invention is composed of:


a multiplexer with input that is represented by the signals which are not yet,
or are only partially, amplified and which, eventually, are to be shifted to their

final transmitting frequency;
a compensation technique of the non-linear distortions;
an amplification chain that is positioned just before the irradiating system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a technique to transmit several broadcast
signals using only one irradiating system for the entire signals ensemble.The system has its preferred, but not limited, utilisation in diffusion systems for
TV and radiophone signals. However, actually, the proposed technique can also
be used in other application fields, and it is especially valuable for systems that
require the transmission of several signals from a single radio station, as in a
multimedia diffusion system.The known broadcast transmitting systems, in their easiest architecture, are
typically characterised, for each signal to be transmitted, by:
one or more systems that realise the shifting of the signal up to the
transmission frequency, hereafter named frequency shifters for easiness of
description;eventually a system that compensates the nonlinear distortions introduced
by the amplification chain on the said signal, hereafter named lineariser for
easiness of description;a suitable amplification chain to feed the irradiating system with an adequate
signal power;an irradiating system, that is composed, in its easiest form, of an antenna
and of all the systems required to connect the amplification chain output to
the said antenna, with the potential inclusion of some filtering stages. In
other situations the irradiating system is shared by several signals through
the use of appropriate combiners as described later.Usually the antennas, because of well known technical reasons, are either
placed at the top of trellises or located in transmitting sites that, because of their 
geographical position, make the installation difficult and expensive. As a
consequence it is convenient to use the same irradiating system to transmit
several signals, provided that the working frequency band of the antenna is
wide enough to handle the overall signal obtained by the frequency multiplexing
of the said signals.Some of the known systems used so far to transmit N signals on N different
carriers are characterised, for each signal, by one or more frequency shifters,
eventually a lineariser, an amplification stage, and an irradiating system. This
architecture is shown in Fig.1, which shows neither the frequency shifters
(eventually positioned before each represented block) nor the mid amplification
stages that could be used.The critical characteristics of such an architecture are:
it is complex and expensive because it requires an irradiating system for
each signal;it is complex and expensive because it requires a complete
