<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a track access
control system in rotating disc devices. The present
invention relates, in particular, to a track access and
servo control system in optical magneto-optical disc
devices.Optical discs and magneto-optical discs are used as
large capacity external memories for their large data
recording density. The optical discs and magneto-optical
discs have narrow (typically 1.6 µm width) tracks which are
preformed spirally or concentrically on its surface, and
each bit of data is recorded on a portion of a track.In particular, in the magneto-optical discs, data is
recorded as a state of magnetization in each portion of the
tracks, and therefore new data can be written over a
portion of a disc where the previously written data is
recorded thereon. There are two types of magneto-optical
discs depending on the types of the magnetic medium, one is
overwritable and the other is non-overwritable. In the
non-overwritable magneto-optical discs, an erasing
operation is necessary before each writing operation.Each bit of data is written on a portion of a track
surface by impinging a high-intensity optical (light) beam
onto the track surface for changing or not changing a
magnetization state of the portion, and is read by
impinging a low-intensity optical beam onto the track
surface, and then detecting the polarization of an optical
beam reflected at the track surface, where the polarization
is caused by the magnetization state of the portion of the
track at which the optical beam is reflected.Generally, to carry out an effective and accurate
writing and reading operation, the optical beam impinged
onto the track surface is required to exactly follow the
track surface. To exactly follow the track, a track servo
system is provided. Further, generally, when a data 
writing or reading command is received, the beam position
is moved to the object track position, i.e., a track seek
operation is carried out. In the seek operation, a velocity
in moving the beam position and the time for moving the
beam position are calculated, and a current for driving a
motor to move the beam position, is given to the motor so
that the motor is moved in the calculated velocity for the
calculated duration.However, in the present manufacturing technique of
optical discs and magneto-optical discs, an eccentricity of
the tracks is inevitable, typically, the radius of a track
varies in the range of about 50 µm. Since the range of the
variation of the radius is much larger than the track
width, the
