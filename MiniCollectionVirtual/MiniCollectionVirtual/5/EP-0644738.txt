<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for mapping a wall of a heart forming a chamber in the heart comprising a guiding catheter (21) having a lumen extending therethrough and a mapping catheter (51) having a shaft (52) that is slidably mounted in the lumen of the guiding catheter. A basket assembly (61) is provided and is comprised of a plurality of circumferentially spaced-apart longitudinally extending arms (62) having proximal and distal extremities (63, 64). The proximal extremities of the arms are secured to the distal extremity of the shaft of the mapping catheter. Each of the arms includes a member formed of a material having a recoverable strain in excess of 1 % and had an outwardly bowed shape memory. At least one electrode (68) is provided on each of the arms. Conductors (69) connected to the electrodes are carried by the arms.

<DESCRIPTION>
In general, the object of the present invention
is to provide an apparatus which is suitable for
ventricular mapping.Endocardial mapping catheters have hereinbefore
been provided. However, they have been of limited
capability particularly because they only have a small
number of electrodes which makes it difficult to
accurately map the electrical potentials in the walls
from the chambers of the heart as for example the left
ventricle. With such catheters, it is often been
necessary to manuver the distal extremity of the
catheter extensively and to reposition it incremently
self circumferentially in the chamber of the heart.
Such procedures are time consuming and are relatively
inaccurate because such measurements take place over
more than one heart beat. For that reason it has been
difficult to properly characterize the electrical
potentials which have been derived from the heart.
There is therefore need for a new and improved
endocardial mapping apparatus for accomplishing the
same.US 4,699,147 describes a cardiac mapping probe
comprising a catheter tube with wire assemblies
projecting from its distal end. Electrodes are
mounted on each wire assembly.The present invention provides an apparatus for
mapping electrical signals in a heart wall as set out
in claim 1. This invention relates to an apparatus for
ventricular mapping and ablation.Another object of the invention is to provide an
apparatus in which deployment can be readily
accomplished.Another object of the invention is to provide an
apparatus in which the basket has arms that yieldably
engage the wall of the heart.Another object of the invention is to provide an
apparatus of the above character in which the arms
along substantially the entire length thereof remain
in engagement with the wall of the heart during
beating of the heart without waisting occurring.Another object of the invention is to provide an
apparatus of the above character in which the material
utilized in the basket has elastic properties.Another object of the invention is to provide an
apparatus of the above character in which the material
utilized is stress activated.Another object of the invention is to provide an
apparatus of the above character which is thermally
activated.Another object of the invention is to provide an
apparatus of the above character in which the basket is
formed of a material which is superelastic at any
temperature in the range of 15°C-50°C.Additional objects and features of the invention
will appear from the following description in which the

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for mapping electrical signals
arising in a wall of a heart forming a chamber in the

heart comprising a flexible shaft (52) having proximal
and distal extremities (53, 54) and a basket assembly

(61), the basket assembly comprising a plurality of
circumferentially spaced-apart longitudinally extending

arms (62) having proximal and distal extremities (63,
64) and having an outwardly facing surface and a

plurality of electrodes (68) spaced apart
longitudinally of the arms, conductor means (71) on the

arms for conducting electrical signals detected by the
electrodes and means securing the proximal extremities

of the arms to the distal extremity of the shaft
characterized in that in each of said arms (62) there

is included a member (72) formed of an elastic material
having a recoverable strain of more than 1.0% and

having an outwardly bowed shape memory and in that
means is carried by each of said arms for mounting said

electrodes so that they are flush with the outwardly
facing surface of each arm and so that they are

insulated from each other and are exposed solely in a
direction extending from the outwardly facing surface

of each arm and face only the wall of the chamber.
Apparatus as in Claim 1 further characterized
in that a guiding catheter (21) is provided comprised

of a flexible elongate tubular member (22) having a
lumen (27) extending therethrough, said basket assembly

(61) being compressible so that it can be moved out of 
and into the lumen of the flexible elongate tubular

member, further characterized in that said basket
assembly is capable springing into its outwardly bowed

shape memory upon discharge from the lumen of the
guiding catheter.
Apparatus as in Claim 2 further characterized
in that said member in each of said arms is formed of

a shape-memory material.
Apparatus as in Claim 3 further characterized
in that said shape-memory material is a

stress-activated material.
Apparatus as in Claim 3 further characterized
in that said shape-memory material is a thermally-activated

material.
Apparatus as in Claim 1 further characterized
in that said member is formed of a plastic.
Apparatus as in Claim 1 further characterized
in that said member is in the form of a band having a

width which is substantially greater than its

section. 
Apparatus as in Claim 7 further characterized

electrodes being exposed through said openings in the

flex strip.

and in that the proximal and distal extremities of the
arms have a reduced cross-sectional area to reduce the

column strength and stiffness of the proximal and
distal extremities to help ensure that the electrodes

pumping of the heart occurs.
