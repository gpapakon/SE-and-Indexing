<ABSTRACT>
A cover plate (AB) serves as load pick-up for placing loads to be weighed and is supported via load corners (LE). These have a base plate (BP), to which, according to the invention, at least one vertically arranged bolt (SS1,SS2;SS) with a countersunk head (SK1,SK2;SK) is connected. The bolt is preferably designed as a countersunk screw and connected to the base plate (BP) by means of a threaded bore (B1,B2). The countersunk head (SK1,SK2;SK) of bolt or countersunk screw engages in the head plate (KP) in a conical countersink (KS1,KS2;KS). This arrangement has the advantage that the functions of horizontal swing limiting, lifting security and self-centring can be implemented at the same time with the aid of the at least one bolt or of the countersunk screws (SS1,SS2;SS) as a single component. As a further special advantage, there results an especially low profile (H), exclusively dependent on the height of the weighing cell (WZ) between base plate and head plate (BP,KP), for the load corners (LE) of the platform balance.

<CLAIMS>
A platform weighing machine, comprising 

a) a platform (AB) for the deposition of objects to be 
weighed, 
b) load corners (LE) for supporting the platform (AB) 
at the corners, which load corners (LE) each 

comprise 

b1) a base plate (BP) 
b2) at least one bolt (SS1, SS2; SS) with 
countersunk head (SK1, SK2; SK), which is 

vertically arranged and connected with the 
base plate (BP), 
b3) a top plate (KP) with a tapered indentation 
(KS1, KS2; S) for receiving the countersunk 

head (SK1, SK2; SK) of the at least one bolt 
(SS1, SS2; SS), and 
b4) a weighing cell (WZ) which is arranged between 
the base and top plates (BP, KP), preferably 

centrally. 
A platform weighing machine according to claim 1, 
wherein the at least one bolt is constructed as a 

countersunk screw (SS1, SS2; SS), which is 
preferably connected with the base plate (BP) by 

means of a tapped hole (B1, B2).
