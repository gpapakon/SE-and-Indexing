<ABSTRACT>
The device is intended, in particular, for holding a plastic beverage bottle, a so-called PET bottle (1). The device comprises two holding means (6, 7) in each case for locally bounded holding of the bottle. The two holding means are joined together by a relatively rigid web (8). The second holding means (7) is designed as a ring (9), and the first holding means (6) is designed as a clip (18). The holding device is mounted on the bottle (1) to be held by the ring (9) being pushed over the bottle from above until the clip (18) lies in the region of the bottle neck (3). At that point, the clip (18) is snapped over the bottle neck in a radial direction relative to the bottle. (16) denotes a holding handle which extends in the longitudinal direction of the web (8). A thumb depression (26), together with the holding handle (16) serves for the simple tipping of the bottle when pouring out the liquid. Furthermore, (17) provides a carrying ring on which a PET bottle can be carried comfortably by one finger. The holding handle (16) projects from the PET bottle in a radial direction only to the extent that a plurality of bottles arranged adjacently can be stored essentially without wasting space if the carrying handle extends at an angle of about 45 DEG  to the row of bottles.
