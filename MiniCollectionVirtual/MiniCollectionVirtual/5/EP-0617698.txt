<ABSTRACT>
An improved process for reducing nitrogen oxide emissions to the atmosphere comprises the injection of ammonia vapor, formed by the vaporization of an aqueous ammonia solution (5), into a combustion effluent. A dilute aqueous ammonia phase, produced by such vaporization, may also be injected, either in vapor or liquid form, into a combustion effluent (19). Temperature and pressure control of such vaporization may be used to maintain the desired concentration of ammonia injected into the combustion effluent.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a non-catalytic method for
reducing the concentration of nitrogen oxides in a combustion
effluent. More particularly, the invention is directed to a process in
which an ammonia rich vapor is injected into such a combustion
effluent to convert the nitrogen oxides contained therein to less
deleterious compounds, the process improvement comprising the production
of the ammonia rich vapor from an aqueous ammonia solution.Combustion effluents and waste products from various installations
are a major source of air pollution when discharged into the
atmosphere. One particularly troublesome pollutant found in many
combustion effluent streams is NO2, a major irritant. Furthermore, it
is believed that NO2 undergoes a series of reactions known as photochemical
smog formation, in the presence of sunlight and hydrocarbons.
The major source of NO2 is NOx which to a large degree is generated at
such stationary installations as gas and oil-fired steam boilers for
electric power plants, process heaters, incinerators, coal fired
utility boilers, glass furnaces, cement kilns, and oil field steam
generators.Various methods have been developed for reducing the concentration
of nitrogen oxides in combustion effluents. One such method
is the non-catalytic method disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,900,554 to
Lyon, which patent is incorporated herein by reference. The process
disclosed in that patent teaches the reduction of NOx to N2 by injecting
ammonia into the combustion effluent stream at an elevated temperature.
In general, the following two equations describe the reactions
which govern the overall process:
NOx + NH3 + O2 + (H2) ----- → N2 + H2ONH3 + O2 -----→ NOx + H2OAs indicated by the first equation, hydrogen (H2) can be
injected along with NH3 to extend the effectiveness of the first
reaction, for example, at lower temperatures. Of course, it is
desirable to minimize the formation of NOx according to the second
equation.U.S. Patent No. 3,900,554 teaches the use of ammonia either
as a pure substance or in a precursor form. Useful precursor forms of
ammonia include the compounds ammonium carbonate, ammonium formate,
and ammonium oxalate. All the these substances yield ammonia on
vaporization, while the formate and oxalate precursors also yield
formic acid and oxalic acid respectively. Vaporization of the ammonia
or its precursor may be accomplished as a separate step or by its
injection into the hot effluent being treated. If vaporization of
ammonium formate or ammonium oxalate, or their

A non-catalytic process for reducing the concentration of NO

combustion effluent produced by the operation of fired equipment, the process

comprising the following steps :

(a) passing an aqueous ammonia solution from a source thereof to a
separation zone;
(b) subjecting aqueous ammonia solution in the separation zone to
elevated temperature and pressure, and separating the solution into at least two

streams of which a first stream comprises ammonia-rich vapor, and a second stream
comprises dilute aqueous ammonia solution;
(c) separately recovering the first stream and the second stream, and
combining the first stream with a pressurized carrier gas to form a gas mixture

comprising carrier gas and ammonia;
(d) injecting the gas mixture formed in step (c) into the combustion
effluent; and
(e) utilizing at least some of the second stream recovered in step (c) by
injection into the combustion effluent and/or in a scrubber or other plant unit.
The process of claim 1, wherein said dilute aqueous ammonia is
injected into combustion effluent at a different location from where the ammonia-rich

vapor is injected.
The process of claim 1 or claim 2 wherein at least some second stream
is combined with carrier gas and said first stream to produce a combined ammonia

vapor stream, and said combined ammonia vapor stream is injected into combustion
effluent. 
The process of any one of claims 1 to 3 wherein the carrier gas is at an
elevated temperature.
The process of any one of claims 1 to 4 wherein the carrier gas is
steam or air.
The process of any one of claims 1 to 5 wherein the pressurized carrier
gas is air at a temperature in the range of from 400 to 500°F (204.4 to 260°C).
The process of any one of claims 1 to 6 wherein a heating source for
supplying heat to the separation zone is controlled by a pressure sensing controller

which senses the pressure in the separation zone, such that a substantially constant
pressure is maintained in the separation zone to ensure that a desired flow rate of the

ammonia-rich vapor out of the separation zone is substantially accurately achieved.
The process of claim 7 wherein the flow rate of ammonia-rich vapor is
controlled in response to a demand signal and wherein the flow rate of said dilute

aqueous ammonia stream is controlled by a temperature-sensing controller such that
the desired ammonia concentration in the liquid phase of the separation zone is

maintained as a function of temperature and pressure.
The process of any one of claims 1 to 8 wherein the operating

separation zone is maintained to ensure that the desired flow rate and injection rate of

said ammonia-rich vapor injection is achieved, and wherein the flow rate of the
ammonia-rich vapor is controlled in response to a demand signal, and wherein the flow

rate of said second or blow-down stream is controlled by a temperature-sensing
controller which senses the temperature in said separation zone, such that the desired

ammonia concentration in the liquid phase of the separation zone is maintained as a
function of temperature and pressure.
