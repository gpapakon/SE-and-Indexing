<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a dielectric
thin film device used for example in a memory device, a
pyroelectric device, a piezoelectric device or an
electrooptic device. Further, the present
invention relates to a method for manufacturing
the dielectric thin film used in such a dielectric
thin film device.Recently, non-volatile semiconductor memory
elements have attracted much public attention.
These non-volatile semiconductor memory elements
consist of for example a read only memory
(ROM), a programmable ROM (PROM), an erasable PROM
(EPROM) or an electrically erasable PROM (EEPROM).
In particular, the EEPROM is promising since
stored contents of the EEPROM can be electrically
rewritten. In the EEPROM, a trap region or a
floating gate within a gate insulating film of a
metal insulator semiconductor field effect
transistor (MIS-FET) is charged by charge 
injection from a silicon substrate. The surface
conductivity of the substrate is modulated by
electrostatic induction of injected charges.A ferroelectric non-volatile memory utilizing
spontaneous polarization of a ferroelectric
substance can be used as a non-volatile memory
using a method completely different from the above
known modulating method of the EEPROM. This
ferroelectric non-volatile memory can have one of
two structures, either a structure composed of an
MFS (metal ferroelectric semiconductor)-FET (field
effect transistor) structure or a capacitor
structure.In the MFS-FET structure, a gate insulating
film of the MIS-FET is formed as a ferroelectric
thin film. The conductivity of a semiconductor
surface is modulated by charges induced on the
semiconductor surface such that spontaneous
polarization of a ferroelectric material is
compensated in accordance with the direction and
the magnitude of the spontaneous polarization.
Memory contents are read by utilizing this
modulation.In the capacitor structure, a ferroelectric
thin film is supported between two electrodes.
Memory contents are read by detecting the 
existence or nonexistence of an inverted electric
current caused by inverting the spontaneous
polarization of the ferroelectric material.For example, the ferroelectric material used
for such a ferroelectric non-volatile memory can
be for example lead zirconate titanate (which is called PZT in
the following description), lead titanate
(PbTiO3), or barium titanate (BaTiO3). At
present, the PZT material is being vigorously
researched as a material for a most promising
non-volatile memory.A dynamic random access memory (DRAM)
appeared in 1970
