<ABSTRACT>
This device comprises a longitudinal support (3) whose front end has a fixing mechanism (1), injection valve (V) and rinsing mechanism (2). The fixing mechanism (1) is giratory and comprises a body (5) and clamps (7) that operate in such a way that the fixing diameter is equal to the rinsing diameter; this body (5) may be provided with a duct (51) that collects the residual rinsing liquid (53) and is combined with a fixed suction duct (52). Through the valve (V) passes a hose (25) that is compressed by closure seats (35, 36) whose action lets the rinsing air or liquid through. The rinsing mechanism (2) includes a tank (48) and a hollow needle which is introduced into the bottle (10). Application to industry bottling processes.
