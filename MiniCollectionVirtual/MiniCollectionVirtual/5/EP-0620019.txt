<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a disposable medical 
syringe which has a hollow plunger (16) to receive a used inoculation 

needle (27). The syringe has a hollow syringe barrel (12), open on 
one end 

and closed on the other. A hollow plunger assembly (14), which 
extends out the open end of the syringe barrel, has a hollow tube (16) 

with a fixed seal (18) attached at one end. At the other end of the 
plunger assembly, a needle holder (24) is sized to slide within the 

hollow tube. The sliding seal and needle holder are biased 
toward each other by a stretched, resilient tube (32) that has a fluid 

passageway (21) passing through the sliding seal, resilient tube, and 
needle holder. The needle holder is normally locked at one end 

of the plunger assembly by a locking means (40). As the syringe is 
collapsed, the syringe barrel trips the locking means to permit 

the needle holder, and attached inoculation needle, to be 
retracted into the hollow tube. The three components--inoculation 

needle, hollow tube, and syringe barrel--are 
telescoped together by this action to compact the throw-away unit 

with the used inoculation needle resting in a position protected 
by the double outer walls.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved single use hypodermic safety 
syringe, and more specifically to a plunger within the syringe 
which permits a conventional inoculation needle to be retracted 
to a position within the plunger. Hypodermic syringes are well known in the art having been 
used for many years in the medical profession. In recent years 
the problem of a person using a syringe and becoming infected by 
an inadvertent prick from a used inoculation needle has 
intensified the search for a hypodermic syringe which protects 
those who might have to handle it. Several devices have used a spring-loaded cover to shield an 
inoculation needle after it has been withdrawn from a person 
receiving an inoculation. For instance see U.S. Patent 4,900,311 
to Stern et at., U.S. Patent 4,955,868 to Klein, or U.S. Patent 
4,966,592 to Burns et al. In each of these devices, the shield 
becomes rather unwieldy because it has to have a rather large  
 
cross-section so as so slide around the syringe barrel. The 
large cross-section prevents the person using the hypodermic 
syringe from accurately locating an insertion point because the 
insertion point is covered by the shield. Also since the 
inoculation needle is capped after the needle is used, an 
elongated shape is maintained. The elongated shape makes it 
easier to snap off both the guard and inoculation needle if the 
syringe barrel is inadvertently held for some reason and someone 
hits the syringe. Several other devices have inoculation needles moving 
through a protective guard which is smaller than the syringe 
barrel near the insertion tip of an inoculation needle. For 
instance see U.S. Patent 2,925,083 to Craig, U.S. Patent 
4,911,693 to Paris, or U.S. Patent 5,135,510 to Maszkiewicz et 
al. The insertion point can be seen easier with the latter 
mentioned devices since the guard is of much smaller diameter, 
but the inoculation needle still remains at the end of an 
elongated device. It is much easier to snap an elongated device 
when it gets inadvertently held near one end. The leverage is 
such that there are times when an inoculation needle could be 
exposed just because the syringe barrel got caught in some 
unusual manner. None of the above inventions have recognized the fact that 
an inoculation needle can be drawn back into the syringe barrel 
to compact the unit that is thrown away. Other inventions 
illustrate devices which use a spring to retract an inoculation  
 
needle inside a plunger. For instance see U.S. Patent 4,994,034 
to

<CLAIMS>
A syringe for inoculating fluids through an inoculation 
needle, the syringe comprising: 

   a syringe barrel having an inside surface and a closed end 
and an open end; 

   a hollow tube, sized to slide within the syringe barrel, the 
hollow tube having a first end positioned within the syringe 

barrel and a second end; 
   a sliding seal fixed adjacent the first end and providing a 

sliding seal between the hollow tube and the inside surface, the 
sliding seal further having a fluid passageway therethrough 

connecting a volume within the syringe barrel to a volume within 
the hollow tube; 

   a resilient tube, attached at one end to the sliding seal in 
fluid communication with the fluid passageway, the tube extending 

toward the second end; 
   a needle holder, attached on the opposite end of the 

resilient tube, the needle holder sized to slide freely within 
the hollow tube; 

   the needle holder also having the inoculation needle 
attached and further having a fluid passageway extending from the 

resilient tube through the needle holder and on through the 
inoculation needle; 

   a biasing means for biasing the needle holder toward the 
first end;

 
   a locking means, anchored by the hollow tube, for locking 

the needle holder adjacent the second end and releasing the 
needle holder to retract the inoculation needle within the hollow 

tube whenever the syringe barrel moves adjacent the second end. 
A syringe according to claim 1 further including: 
   a finger rest attached to the hollow tube. 
A syringe according to claim 1 or 2 wherein the needle holder has 
LUER LOCK threads on one end. 
A syringe according to any one of claims 1 to 3 wherein 
the hollow tube has a tab opening adjacent the second end; and 

   the locking means is a tab locking ring having a locking 
surface biased to protrude through the tab opening and extend 

into the hollow tube, the tab further having a cammed release 
surface for camming the tab away from the hollow tube whenever 

the syringe barrel cams against the cammed release surface. 
A syringe according to any one of claims 1 to 4 wherein the biasing means is 
the resilient tube stretched between the sliding seal and the 

needle holder. 
A syringe according to any one of claims 1 to 4 wherein the biasing means is a 
spring stretched between the sliding seal and the needle holder. 
A syringe according to any one of claims 1 to 4 wherein the biasing means is a 
compressed spring connected between the syringe barrel adjacent 

the open end and the needle holder.
