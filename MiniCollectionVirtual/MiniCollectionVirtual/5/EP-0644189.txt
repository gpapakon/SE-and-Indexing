<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
resolving stereoisomers of aliphatic epoxides, and
especially to the resolution of enantiomeric isomers
thereof.Since one enantiomer of an asymmetric compound can
differ from another enantiomer of that asymmetric
compound in its actions within a living body, methods
capable of providing optical resolution of enantiomeric
mixtures as well as asymmetric synthesis methods have
been considered important in organic chemistry.Generally, compounds represented by Formula (1) set
forth hereinbelow, are highly reactive and at the same
time possess a unique chemical reactivity, because of
strain associated with the three-membered ether ring.
Various chemical conversions of the Formula (1)
compounds are possible through ring opening reactions,
and therefore, these compounds are important
intermediates in the synthesis of organic compounds, and
are also important as monomers in forming epoxy resins.Stereoisomers of aliphatic epoxides can be used as
raw materials in the synthesis of various compounds.
Accordingly, if they could be analyzed, and also produced
through a process that could be easily carried out 
on an industrial scale, a great contribution to the
chemical arts would be made.As conventional processes for obtaining optically
active compounds, there are asymmetric synthesis
methods, optical resolution methods by way of a diastereomer,
and biochemical synthesis methods using an
enzyme of a microorganism. Asymmetric synthesis
processes have a drawback in that an intended compound
having a high optical purity usually cannot be obtained.
Similarly, processes which proceed by way of a
diastereomer are difficult and equimolar amounts of
different optically active compounds are necessary.
Furthermore, biochemical synthesis processes are
inadequate in that it is often quite difficult to find
an appropriate enzyme or microorganism capable of
achieving a desired synthesis.A chiral separation of an aliphatic epoxide using
a derivatized cyclodextrin as a chiral stationary phase
(CSP) for a capillary gas chromatography column was
reported by Professor Armstrong in Anal. Chem., 1990,
Volume 62, pp. 914-923 and in A Guide to Using Cyclo-dextrin
Bonded Phases for Gas Chromatography, (1990
Edition), Astec Co. However, these methods did not
provide a good separation that could be used for a trace
analysis of one of the enantiomers. In addition, gas
chromatography methods are only suitable for analytical
purposes, instead of being applicable to the preparation
of stereoisomers.On
