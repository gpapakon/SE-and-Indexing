<ABSTRACT>
A switching system (105) allows any one conferee (e.g. at 101) on a 
video conference to assume the role of manually manipulating (144) the video 

picture that will be seen by all conferees (chair view) (101-104). In addition, each 
individual conferee (102-104) is allowed to determine their own video picture 

content or to select the chair view (by 123-128). Further, anyone of conferees (101-104) 
can assume the role of determining the chair view. In addition, for the video 

classroom, a chair view video picture is composed such that the picture displays the 
visual aid with an insert for an instructor and an insert for a student asking a 

question. Further, the instructor selects by using a button (129,130) or mouse which 
student is to be displayed in the student insert, and the video picture automatically 

displays that student. In another embodiment of the system, the students request 
permission to ask a question by actuation of a switch on their telephone set, and the 

names of students asking questions are displayed on a computer display screen. The 
instructor then can select the student by manipulating the cursor on the computer 

display to select the desired student.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to communication systems and, in particular, to a 
telecommunication switching system providing video conferencing capabilities. In present video conferences, a video picture seen by the conferees may 
be displayed in the following ways: show all the conferees, show the conferee that is 
talking, or show all the conferees with the talking conferee highlighted. In addition, 
it is known where a video conference is being conducted between two specially 
equipped conference rooms to allow the conferees in one conference room to control 
the video camera in the other conference room so as to be able to point that camera 
at various people or objects in the other conference room. Also, it is known where 
each conferee has a split screen and can select the pictures of the other conferees to 
be displayed in the split screen. The problem with these capabilities is that often the video picture seen 
by the conferees should include a visual aid, e.g., view graph, plus the individual 
who is giving the presentation or the individual who is asking a question. This 
problem often arises where classes are being taught by video or during video 
business conferences. In addition, it is desirable that one individual be able to 
control the video picture seen by the other conferees and to compose this picture by 
including people or visual aids. Further, in the business conference, it is desirable 
for different individuals to control the video picture seen by other conferees as the 
topic of the business conference change. Also, each conferee needs the ability to 
control their own picture if they desire. In addition, in the classroom situation, it is 
desirable to automate the process whereby students ask questions and are displayed 
in the video picture. The foregoing problems are solved, and a technical advance is achieved 
by a system and method which allows one of the conferees on the conference to 
assume the role of manually manipulating the content of a video picture that will be 
seen by all conferees (chair view). In addition, each individual conferee is allowed 
to determine their own video picture content or to select the chair view. These 
capabilities provide the reality of a virtual meeting room and allow other conferees 
to be freed of manipulating their own video picture content. Further, anyone of 
conferees can assume the role of determining the chair view which allows control of 
chair view to shift as the principal speaker of the video conference shifts.  In addition, for the

<CLAIMS>
A method for controlling a video conference between plurality of 
video terminals (101-104) interconnected by a telecommunication switching system 

with each video terminal transmitting a video picture, the method comprising the 
steps of: 

   CHARACTERIZED IN THAT 
   determining (1320, 1321, 1345, 1348, 1351, 1354) a chair view picture 

by a first one of the video terminals wherein the chair view picture is then made 
available to all video terminals; 

   requesting (1360, 1361) delivery of the chair view picture as determined 
by the first one of the video terminals from the telecommunication switching system 

by a second one of the video terminals; and 
   requesting (1316, 1322, 1325) delivery of a first video picture from the 

telecommunication switching system by a third one of the video terminals.
