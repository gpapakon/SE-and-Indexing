<ABSTRACT>
Surfactant amphoacetates of higher purity, derived from imidazoline and containing virtually negligible quantities of unalkylated amidoamines, small quantities of glycolic acid salts and of monochloroacetate salts. They can be obtained by reaction of an alkylimidazoline with monochloroacetic acid in the presence of an alkali at a pH not exceeding 10. They have improved surfactant and softness properties.

<CLAIMS>
A process for preparing an amphoacetate surfactant comprising less than about 3.5%
by weight of non alkylated amide and less than about 4.5% by weight of glycolic acid

with respect to the weight of amphoacetate, by reacting an alkylimidazoline or an
open ring derivative thereof with a monohalogenoacetic acid or a salt thereof in the

presence of an alkali, in which the pH of the reaction mixture during the reaction is
maintained in the range about 8.5 to about 10; in which the molar ratio of the

monohalogenoaetic acid or a salt thereof to the alkylimidazoline or open ring
derivative thereof is in the range 1.05: 1 to less than 1.4:1.
A process according to claim 1, in which the pH of the reaction mixture during the
reaction is maintained in the range about 8.5 to about 9.5.
A process according to claim 1 or claim 2, in which the alkylimidazoline is a
compound represented by the following formula:



in which R is an aliphatic radical containing 5 to 19 carbon atoms per molecule, X is
OH or NH
2
 and n is a whole number from 2 to 4 inclusive.
A process according to claims 1 to 3, in which X represents OH.
A process according to one of claims 1 to 4, in which R derives from an acid selected
fro
m the group constituted coco oil fatty acids, palm oil fatty acids, capric acid,
caproic acid, caprylic acid, hexadecadienoic acid, lauric acid, linoleic acid, linolenic

acid, margaric acid, myristic acid, myristoleic acid, oleic acid, palmitic acid,
palmitoleic acid and stearic acid, and mixtures thereof. 
A process according to one of claims 1 to 5, in which the alkylimidazoline is coco
imidazoline.
A process according to one of claims 1 to 6, in which the monohalogenoacetic
reagent is the sodium salt of monochloroacetic acid.
A process according to one of claims 1 to 7, in which the alkali is selected from the
group constituted by sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate,

potassium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, potassium bicarbonate and mixtures
thereof.
A process according to one of claims 1 to 8, in which the reaction is carried out at a
temperature of up to 95°C, and more particularly in the range about 50°C to about

95°C.
A process according to claim 9, in which the temperature is in the range from about
75°C to about 85°C.
A process according to one of claims 1 to 10, in which the major portion of the
imidazoline is in the form of an open ring during the reaction.
A process according to one of claims 1 to 10, 
characterized in that
 the
alkylimidazoline is reacted with heat at a pH in the range from about 8.5 to about 9.5

to form an open ring derivative of said alkylimidazoline, then said open ring
derivative is reacted with a monohalogenoacetic acid or a salt thereof in the presence

of an alkali and said amphoacetate surfactant is recovered.
