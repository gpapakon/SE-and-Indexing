<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electrosurgical apparatus for 
treating tissue and, more particularly, to an electrosurgical bipolar treating 
apparatus. The use of electrosurgery for cutting tissue is known in the 
art. A typical electrosurgical cutting apparatus comprises a handpiece 
having an active monopolar electrode which conveys high frequency 
electrical energy from a generator to tissue at an operational site. The 
electric circuit is completed through a return electrode attached to the 
patient. A monopolar electrosurgical device gives satisfactory 
performance as long as the circuit is efficiently completed through the 
return electrode. However, because of possible dangers of electrical 
current flowing through the patient's body in undefined paths as it is 
conducted to the return electrode, there has been a growing demand for a 
bipolar cutting device. A bipolar device is defined as a device which has 
two electrodes in close proximity to each other as well as to the surgical 
site and which does not require a patient return electrode for the 
performance of safe and efficacious electrosurgery. In a bipolar device, one of the electrodes is defined as the 
active electrode and the other as the return electrode. The active 
electrode must be capable of setting up a steam barrier with the tissue and 
be capable of performing the same operations of cut, blend and coag as a 
monopolar device. The return electrode must be capable of returning the current 
delivered by the active electrode with minimal to no tissue desiccation or 
destruction at its contact point with the patient's tissue.  
 Although bipolar instruments are known in the prior art, 
heretofore manufacturers have focused attention on the generator output 
stage of units used with monopolar devices and a satisfactory and safe 
bipolar cutting device has not been produced. It has now been found that a safe and efficacious bipolar 
cutting electrosurgical apparatus is obtained by suitably controlling the 
configuration and characteristics of the bipolar electrodes. Document DE-U-9104876.1 describes an electrosurgical 
bipolar cutting apparatus having a handpiece 8 and two electrodes 
mounted thereon. The distal ends of the electrodes are separated from 
one another and together form a tip for electrosurgically cutting tissue 
whereby both distal ends of the electrodes simultaneously contact the 
tissue. The cross-sections of the distal ends of the electrodes may differ. According to the present invention there is provided an 
electrosur

<CLAIMS>
An electrosurgical bipolar treating apparatus comprising a 
handpiece (1) adapted to be connected to a generator which provides high 

frequency electrical energy for performing an electrosurgical operation, 
which handpiece (1) has mounted thereon a first active electrode having a 

proximal end and a distal end (6) and a second return electrode having a 
proximal end and a distal end (7), the proximal end of each electrode being 

connected to the handpiece (1) and the distal end (6,7) of each electrode 
being exposed and being close to but spaced apart from the distal end 

(7,6) of the other electrode, said exposed distal ends (6,7) defining a tip for 
electrosurgically treating tissue at an operational site on a patient, which tip 

is structured so that both distal ends (6,7) simultaneously contact said 
tissue and wherein the active electrode has a higher tissue to electrode 

impedance than the return electrode, said apparatus being characterised in 
that the exposed distal end (6) of the active electrode is substantially the 

same size as the exposed distal end (7) of the return electrode and the 
exposed distal end of the active electrode is coated with a high impedance 

material. 
An apparatus according to claim 1,in which the exposed 
distal end (7) of the return electrode is associated with spring means (22) 

to provide an intimate pressure contact with tissue when the apparatus is 
used. 
An apparatus according to Claim 1 which includes 
hand-operated switching means (3) mounted on the handpiece (1) for 

activating said electrodes.  
 
An apparatus according to Claim 3, in which said switching 
means (3) also includes switches for activating the generator in the blend 

and coag modalities.
