 DescriptionMETHOD AND DEVICE FOR PRODUCTIOtf OF HYDROCARBONSTechnical FieldThe present invention relates to a method of and a device forproduction of hydrocarbons, such as oil and the like.Background ArtIt is known to produce oil by introducing into it gas so as to form an oil-gas fluid which is lifted in a production pipe. The resulting flow is a flow oftwo interacting phases, a gas phase and a liquid phase. Depending on a diameter of the production pipe, a gas factor or a gas quantity dissolved ina mass unit of liquid, physical characteristics of gas and liquid, speed of thegas phase relative to the liquid phase, an exchange of the motion quantitybetween the phases and therefore a share of gas phase energy spent fordisplacement of the liquid phase can substantially change during the processof flowing of the two-phase medium. Due to the changes in the structure ofthe two-phase flow during the process of flowing and redistribution of energy of the gas phase used for the displacement of the liquid phase and for the displacement of the gas phase itself, it is possible that a correspondingenergy share of the gas phase is insufficient for the displacement of the 

liquid phase. This is characteristic for the case when the energy of the gasphase is the only source of energy for displacement of the liquid phase. This case is typical foi oil wells when the natural energy of the formation is composed of a pc tential energy of oil which is under pressure from rock,ground water, and potential energy of hydrocarbon gas dissolved in oil,which are transfei red into the gas phase when the pressure in the fluidbecomes lower than the saturation pressure. Oil which is lifted in a well toa certain height by the pressure of rock, ground water, gravitational energy,can move further only due to the energy of gas dissolved in oil andtransferred to the liquid phase at a certain level in the well when thehydrostatic pressure in the oil column becomes lower than the saturationpressure. During movement of the fluid to a well-head with reducingpressure the quantity of gas emerging from oil is increased and the structureof the flow changes. An increase of the gas quantity transferred from thedissolved condition into the gas phase and correspondingly of its speedduring movement to the well head leads to the situation that in a portion ofthe well which adjoins the well head an annular mode of flow is formed, whenthe oil forms a film extending along the pipe wall while a gas nuculeos contains liquid drops.

-10- Claims
1. A method of production of hydrocarbons, comprising the
steps of introducing into an oil well a production pipe having an inlet to be
located substantially in a region of a well bottom and an outlet to be located
substantially in a region of a well head, so that an oil-gas mixture flow flows
from the inlet to the outlet of the production pipe; and increasing in the
production pipe a resistance to movement of a gas phase relative to an oil
phase of the oil-gas mixture by subdividing at least a portion of the
production pipe into a plurality of passages each having a cross-section
which is a fraction of a cross-section of the production pipe and extending in
a direction from the inlet to the outlet of the production pipe so as to
subdivide said oil-gas mixture flow into a plurality of individual oil-gas mixture
flows which have a fraction of a cross-section of said oil-gas mixture and flow
simultaneously in a direction from the inlet to the outlet of the production
pipe. 

2. A method as defined in claim 1 , wherein said subdividing
includes forming a plurality of individual passages which extend
concentrically with one another in a direction from the inlet to the outlet of the
production pipe, so that the individual oil-gas flows simultaneously flow
through the individual concentric passages.
3. A method as defined in claim 1 , wherein said subdividing
includes forming a plurality of passages which extend substantially parallel and side by side with one another in a direction from the inlet to the outlet of
the production pipe, so that the individual oil-gas flows flow simultaneously through the side-by-side passages.
4. A method as defined in claim 1 , wherein said subdividing
inc udes forming a plurality of individual passages through which the ind vidual oil-gas flows flow simultaneously in a direction from the inlet to the
ou let of the production pipe; and changing a geometry of the individual
pa ;sages in direction of movement of the individual oil-gas flows.
