<ABSTRACT>
A disengaging device comprising a hydraulic actuator (1, 2, 3-100, 200) including at least one fixed part (1, 100) and at least one movable part (2, 200) defining a first control chamber (50, 500), as well as a release bearing (15, 150) coupled to said movable part (2, 200), which drives said release bearing in a first axial direction, or disengaging direction, to transfer a disengaging force to an engagement part (25). Said actuator comprises a second control chamber (60, 600) separate from the first control chamber (50, 500) and at least partially defined by said fixed part (1, 100) and said movable part (2, 200), such that it is driven in the opposite direction to the movable part. Application to motor vehicles.

A declutching mechanism, for working in traction on 
the connecting piece (25) of a clutch (40), in 

particular for a motor vehicle, including, firstly, an 
hydraulic actuator (1, 2, 3 - 100, 200) comprising at 

least one fixed member (1, 100) and a movable member 
(2, 200), in piston and cylinder relationship defining 

a first control chamber (50, 500), and secondly, a 
clutch release bearing (15, 150) attached to the 

movable member (2, 200) and manoeuvrable by the latter 
in a first axial direction referred to as a declutching 

direction, for transmitting a tractive declutching 
force to the connecting piece (25), characterised in 

that the said hydraulic actuator (1, 2, 3 - 100, 200) 
comprises a second control chamber (60, 600), which is 

independent of the first control chamber (50, 500) and 
delimited at least partly by the fixed member (1, 100) 

and the movable member (2, 200), for manoeuvre of the 
said movable member and the said clutch release bearing 

axially in the direction opposite to the declutching 
direction. 
A mechanism according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the second control chamber (60, 200) is 

pressurised pneumatically for the purpose of fitting 
the declutching mechanism on its connecting piece (25).  

 
A mechanism according to Claim 2, characterised in 
that the second control chamber (60, 600) is connected 

through a conduit (8) to a common feed connector (12), 
which is also arranged to feed the first control 

chamber (50, 500) via another conduit (11). 
A mechanism according to Claim 3, characterised in 
that the common connector (12) is fixed on a hood piece 

(81) through a cover (13). 
A mechanism according to Claim 2, characterised in 
that the second control chamber (60, 600) is 

pressurised in advance, being closed by a stop valve 
for the purposes of fitting the declutching mechanism 

on its connecting piece (25). 
A mechanism according to Claim 1, in which the 
fixed part (1, 100) has a zone (35) for its fastening 

to a fixed member (82), characterised in that the 
second control chamber (60, 600) has an orifice (9, 90) 

located at the level of the fastening zone of the fixed 
part (1, 100). 
A mechanism according to Claim 1, in which the 
movable member (2) is mounted within a cavity which is 

defined by the fixed member (1) and a guide tube (3) 
for securing the fixed member, characterised in that 

the movable member (2) has within the said cavity an 
end portion having a transverse flange (52) extending  

 
away from the axis of the assembly, the said flange 

delimiting the second control chamber (60). 
A mechanism according to Claim 7, characterised in 
that the said second control chamber (60), delimited by 

the fixed member (1) and the guide tube (3), is closed 
by the said flange (52) of the movable member (2) and 

by a transverse flange (36), which is part of the tube 
guide (3) and which is directed away from the axis of 

the assembly. 
A mechanism according to Claim 8, characterised in 
that the said transverse flange (36) has an L-shaped 

hole (9) for feeding the second control chamber (60). 
A mechanism according to Claim 8, characterised in 
that the said transverse flange (36) is shouldered for 

centring the fixed member (1), which has securing ears 
(35) through which there pass fastening members (30), 

which also pass through the said flange (36) so as to 
secure the assembly comprising the fixed member (1) and 

guide tube (3) to a fixed member (82). 
A mechanism according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the second control chamber (600) is defined in a 

sleeve (122) with which the declutching mechanism is 
provided for abutment with a return spring (121). 
A mechanism according to Claim 11, characterised 
in that the control chamber (600) is defined by the  

 
said abutment sleeve (122), a fixed member (100), a 

piston (200) which is movable with respect to the fixed 
member (100), and a second member (124) for abutment 

with the preloading spring (121). 
A mechanism according to Claim 12, characterised 
in that the second abutment member (124) has a sinuous 

shape, with a transverse outer portion located axially 
on the piston (200), a dish-shaped middle portion for 

engagement with the said spring (121), and an inner 
portion for mounting a ring (156) sealing it with the 

abutment sleeve (122). 
A mechanism according to Claim 13, characterised 
in that the abutment sleeve (122) is secured in hooked 

relationship to a member (157) fixed to the fixed 
member (100). 
A mechanism according to Claim 1, characterised in 

that the two control chambers (50, 500 - 60, 600) are 
offset axially with respect to each other, being 

separated by the movable member (2, 200).
