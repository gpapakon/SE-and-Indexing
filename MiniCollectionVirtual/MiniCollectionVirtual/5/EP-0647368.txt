<ABSTRACT>
The aim of the present invention is to use only one sensor in a system of motor control using Hall sensors. According to the invention, various combinations of potential and/or phase shifts of the two sensor signals of a Hall sensor are formed and motor control signals are determined therefrom. The invention may be used, for example, in a video recorder.

sensor, supplying at its terminals two sensor signals (S1, 
S2) which oscillate in anti-phase about a common mean

amount with respect to the first signal (K1) and
