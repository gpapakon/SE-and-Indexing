<ABSTRACT>
A metal rod having a conical or pyramidal cut extremity is used 
to make a mandrel (21) of a blind rivet. The rod is held in place 

between a pair of die segments (11) such that an end of a preset length 
including the cut extremity is swageable and protrudes from an upper 

surface (14) of the segments (11). Subsequently, the swageable end 
(26) is axially compressed to form a mandrel head (27) by a punch (12) 

which has a lower face (17) extending parallel to the upper surface 
(14) of the segments (11) and a conical or pyramidal recess (18) 

fittable on the cut extremity. Thus, a free intermediate portion of 
the swageable end (26) compressed by the punch (12) swells radially to 

form the head (27) which has a flat flange (31) from which the cut 
extremity (20a) protrudes as a lug (32) upwardly and centrally. The 

mandrel (21), which has the head formed uniform without any 
eccentricity about the axis of a mandrel body, can thus be produced 

inexpensively using nail manufacturing apparatus.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of making a mandrel of a blind 
rivet. Figures 7(a) and 7(b) of the accompanying drawings show a typical 
example of prior art blind rivets. A blind rivet 1 comprises a 
cylindrical rivet body 2 and a mandrel 5 inserted therein, the rivet 
body having at one end thereof a flange-shaped rivet head 3. A bore 4 
through the rivet body receives the mandrel 5, which comprises a 
mandrel body 5a having at its end a mandrel head 6. Adjacent the 
mandrel head is a constricted portion 7 in the mandrel body 5a. The 
mandrel head 6 and the constricted portion 7 are located opposite to 
the rivet 3 located at the other, open end 2a of the rivet body 2. The 
mandrel head 6 can, in use, plastically deform and expand the other, 
open end 2a of the rivet body. The mandrel body 5a will subsequently 
be broken off the mandrel head 6, at the constricted portion 7. The 
reference numerals 8 and 9 denote two workpieces to be fastened one to 
the other (see for example FR-A-1 096 383). Such mandrels 5 for the blind rivets 1 are made of a metal rod, 
for example of an iron rod inexpensively by using in general a nail 
manufacturing apparatus. The round mandrel heads 6 are formed in a 
one-shot manner by a punching press, directly without performing any 
preliminary pressing step. It is however noted that the iron rods 
severed in the nail manufacturing apparatus generally have their 
extremities wedge-shaped or pyramid-shaped. Usually, those iron rods 
having such extremities are directly pressed in a spherical cavity of 
the punching press, in a state such that their ends protrude a 
comparatively great distance from a split die. Those ends tend often 
to slant noticeably or swell irregularly in radial direction during the 
pressing process, so that the pressed heads 6 are rendered somewhat 
offset with respect to the axes of the mandrel bodies 5a. Thus, a 
peripheral portion of the mandrel head is likely to be uneven in its 
thickness and/or shape around the axis of each mandrel body. If, in 
use, such an irregularly formed head 6 of the mandrel 5 presses or 
expands the open end 2a of the rivet body 2, then the open end 2a will 
be deformed non-uniformly as shown in Figure 7(b). Consequently, the 
mandrel head 6 will tend to slip off the rivet body, or the rivet body  
 
2 will collapse during the riveting operation, and/or the rivet as a 
whole will fail to ensure an expected strength of connection, due to 
such an irregular deformation. According to the invention there is provided a

<CLAIMS>
A method of making a mandrel (21) of a blind rivet (40), 
comprising the steps of: 


preparing as the starting material of the mandrel a metal rod 
(20) produced in nail manufacturing apparatus and having a pointed cut 

extremity (20
a
) formed by means of a pair of severing blades of said 
apparatus; 
holding the metal rod (20) in place between a pair of split die 
segments (11), in such a state that the metal rod (20) has a swageable 

end (26) of a predetermined length including the cut extremity (20
a
) 
protruding from an upper surface (14) of the split die (11); and 
pressing the swageable end (26) in its axial direction by means 
of a punch (12) so that a head (27) is formed on the mandrel (20) from 

the swageable end (26) and integral with the rod (20);
 
   wherein the punch (12) has a substantially flat lower face (17) 

and a recess (18) formed therein to be of a dimension and shape 
complementary to said pointed cut extremity (20
a
) of the metal rod (20); and
 
   wherein the punch (12) compresses the swageable end (26) of the 

rod (20) having the cut extremity (20
a
) fitted in the recess (18) such 
that the swageable end (26) is caused to swell radially and evenly to 

form the head (27) comprising a flat flange (31) from which the pointed cut 
extremity (20
a
) protrudes upwardly and centrally thereof. 
A method according to claim 1, wherein the recess (18) in the 
punch (12) is formed to become narrower towards its inner region. 
A method according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the die 
segments (11) have in their upper surfaces (14) shallow recesses (19) 

to restrict the radial expansion of the swageable end (26), 
particularly of a lower peripheral portion of the flange (31) formed 

therein.
