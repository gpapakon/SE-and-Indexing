<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an automatic warming-up method
thereof in hydraulic system, and more particularly, to an automatic warming-up
method thereof applied in various hydraulic systems which are equipped
with an engine and a hydraulic pump driven by the engine, and controlled by a
microcomputer.The conventional hydraulic system is provided with an engine and a hydraulic
pump driven by the engine, and operated by supplying a discharge oil of the hydraulic
pump to one or a plurality of hydraulic actuators.In such a system, since lubricant oil and pressurized oil are not warmed up enough
right after starting the system, there has been problems that the overall system including
the engine and the hydraulic components becomes overstrained when the load is acted
on the hydraulic actuator. Accordingly, it has been usually warmed up for a certain
amount of time right after starting the system. The conventional warming-up methods in hydraulic system are disclosed in
Japanese utility model laid-open No. 80-85329, No. 85-147852, and Japanese patent
laid-open No. 85-119342, and No. 87-167922.In general, these methods include the method in which the warming-up is
performed until the operation can be done with 100 % load by increasing manually the
rotation speed of the engine or controlling the discharge pressure and the discharge oil
amount of the hydraulic pump, and the method in which an instruction is given by a
controller so that the engine is warmed-up until the appropriate number of rotation is
reached and, at the same time, the discharge pressure and the discharge oil amount of
the hydraulic pump are adjusted based on the allowable output of the engine which is
determined by detecting the rack position of a fuel supply pump through a sensor.However, the manual warming-up method has problem that it is not only
inaccurate but toilsome, and the automatic warming-up method has problems of the
difficult initial adjustment of the sensor for detecting the rack position, an aging due to
the use for a long period, and a weak environmental durability since it is installed in the
inside of the engine. Another example of the conventional warming up device and method in hydraulic
system is disclosed in WO 89/05396. In this system the engine controller gives
out an order for warming up the engine at a predetermined rotational speed in
accordance with the information from the temperature sensors. When the
warming of the engine progress and the engine controller ascertains that the
level of an output from the

A method for an automatic warming-up in a hydraulic system comprising an
engine (2), a hydraulic pump (5) driven by said engine (2), at least one

hydraulic actuator (11) operated by an oil discharge from said hydraulic
pump (5), a controller (1) controlling the rotation speed of said engine (2) and

the discharge oil amount and pressure of said hydraulic pump (5), a first

(1) detecting the temperature of the lubricant oil of said engine by said first
temperature sensor, the temperature of the cooling water of said engine by

said second temperature sensor, and the temperature of the pressurized oil
of said hydraulic system by said third temperature sensor;

sending the detected temperature signals to said controller by said
input/output unit;
(2) determining whether or not a warming up is performed by comparing
said temperature signals with predetermined temperature values;
(3) commanding warming up, if the temperatures are below the predetermined values ;
(4) sending a control signal to drive the engine (2) by a predetermined
rotation speed;
(5) increasing the discharge oil amount and the pressure of said hydraulic
pump relatively slowly until the change rate of the rotation speed of said

engine reaches said predetermined rotation speed;
(6) controlling the change rate of the rotation speed of the engine to be at a predetermined
value when said temperature signals are below said

predetermined temperature values; and
