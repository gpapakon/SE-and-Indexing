<ABSTRACT>
A method is provided for isolating 5,7-diene-containing steroids, particularly 3  beta -ols and esters of 3  beta -ols, from a sterol mixture. The method involves (1) treating the mixture with a dienophile or with an oxidizable dienophile precursor in combination with an oxidizing agent so as to provide a Diels-Alder adduct of the 5,7-diene to be isolated, followed by (2) removal of the adduct from the mixture and (3) regeneration of the 5,7-diene with a suitable reducing agent. The invention also encompasses subsequent purification steps and intermediate modification of the Diels-Alder intermediate, e.g., wherein chemical conversion of the Diels-Alder adduct is effected prior to regeneration of the 5,7-diene. Novel compounds which are Diels-Alder adducts of 5,7-diene-containing steroids are provided as well.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to synthetic methods involving steroids, and more
particularly relates to a novel method for isolating steroids containing a 5,7-diene functionality
from a mixture of sterols. The method is especially useful for isolating 5,7-diene-containing
sterols from a mixture containing yeast sterol metabolites.The present invention derives from the development of a biotechnological fermentation
process that produces a yeast sterol mixture enriched in cholesta-5,7,24-triene-3β-ol and
accompanied by other di-olefinic yeast sterol metabolites. The aforementioned trienol, having the
chemical structure (I),

is a valuable compound useful, inter alia, as an intermediate in the synthesis of a variety of
compounds related to vitamin D3 derivatives, e.g., cholesta-5,7-diene-3β-25-diol and other 25-substituted
vitamin D3 precursors. Accordingly, it is necessary to provide a feasible process for
isolating and purifying the trienol (I) from a fermentation mixture containing yeast sterol
metabolites, including lanosterol, 4,4-dimethylzymosterol, 4-methylzyrnosterol, zymosterol and
cholesta-7,24-diene-3β-ol. The mixture may also include squalene. As may be seen from the
following structures, a number of these compounds containing two or more degrees of
unsaturation. Thus, the process of isolation and separation must be specific. 
The present invention thus began as a method for isolating and separating cholesta-5,7,24-triene-3β-ol
from a mixture of the aforementioned yeast sterol metabolites. However, it has now
become clear that the synthetic method originally developed for the aforementioned isolation and
separation process is broadly applicable to the removal of steroids containing 5,7-dienes,
generally, from a mixture of sterols, some of which may contain two or more degrees of
unsaturation.The following references relate to one or more aspects of the present invention:S.C Eyley et al., J.C.S. Perkins Trans. I. pp. 731-735 (1976), describe a method for
synthesizing 25-hydroxyprovitamin D3 and 25ξ,26-dibydroxyprovitamin D3. The method
involves initial reaction of the C-22 aldehyde derived by degradation of ergosterol with a Grignard
reagent derived from 4-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, followed by reductive elimination of the
mesylate of the resulting C-22 alcohol.J.P. Moreau et al., J. Org. Chem.39(14):2018-2023 (1974), is a background reference
which describes the synthesis of 5α-cholesta-7,24-diene-3β-ol and cholesta-5,7,24-triene-3β-ol.J.W. Blunt et al., Biochemistry8(2):671-675 (February
