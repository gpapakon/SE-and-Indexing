<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to new depsipeptide derivatives
having antiparasitic activity.Japanese Kokai Tokkyo Koho 3-35796 (EP-A-0 382 173) discloses depsipeptide
derivative prepared by culturing microorganisms.The object compound of the present invention, depsipeptide
derivatives can be represented by the following general formula (I).
wherein A is benzyl group which has one or more substituent (s) or
phenyl group which has one or more substituent (s),Aa is benzyl group which may have one or more substituent (s) or
phenyl group which may have one or more substituent (s),B and D are each lower alkyl,C is hydrogen or lower alkyl.According to the present invention, the object compound of
depsipeptide derivatives (I) can be prepared by processes which are 
illustrated in the following schemes.It should be indicated that any of D-configured compound,
L-configured compound and/or DL-configured compound are in
the extent of the present invention; however, for the convenience,
only D-configured compounds and L-configured compounds are
explained in the process for preparation as follows.
wherein A, Aa, B, C and D are each as defined above,R is hydrogen or amino protective group,A1 is benzyl group which may have lower alkoxy, A2 is benzyl group which has nitro, or benzyl group which has nitro
and lower alkoxy,A3 is benzyl group which has amino, or benzyl group which has
amino and lower alkoxy,A4 is benzyl group which has mono-or di-lower alkylamino, or
benzyl group which has mono-or di-lower alkylamino and lower
alkoxy,A5 is benzyl group which has cyclic amino, or benzyl group which
has cyclic amino and lower alkoxy,A6 is benzyl group which has hydroxy, or benzyl group which has
hydroxy and lower alkoxy,A7 is benzyl group which has lower alkoxy.Throughout the present specification, the amino acids,
peptides, protective groups, condensing agents, etc. are indicated by
the abbreviations according to the IUPAC-IUB (Commission on
Biological Nomenclature) which are in common use in the field of
artMoreover, unless otherwise indicated, the amino acids and
their residues when shown by such abbreviations are meant to be
L-configured compounds and residues, and when shown by D-abbreviations,
