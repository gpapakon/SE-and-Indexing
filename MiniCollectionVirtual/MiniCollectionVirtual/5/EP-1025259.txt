<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method for adjusting and disinfecting a liquid comprising measuring the proportion of surviving micro-organisms and adjusting, according to said proportion, the type and/or doses of the chemical or physical agent(s) used for said disinfection. The method provides in particular the advantage of being fast and can be easily automated.

Method for adjusting the disinfecting of a liquid, 
characterised in that
 it comprises:

A. at a stage of said disinfecting hereinafter designated stage 2, measurement of the
activity of at least one enzyme by putting microorganisms possibly present in said liquid into

contact with a substrate chosen as being capable of showing the activity of this or these
enzyme(s), this enzymatic activity being called hereinafter characteristic activity,
B. at a stage designated hereinafter stage 1, prior to said stage 2, measurement of the
activity of the same enzyme(s) as in A, this activity being called hereinafter initial activity,
C. translating, for each enzyme, said characteristic activity and initial activity into
contents of surviving microorganisms in said liquid at stage 2 of said disinfecting, this being

via a reference system predetermined with the aid of a sample of said liquid taken at said stage
1 and then exposed to increasing doses of disinfectant(s), as well as
D. adjusting, as a function of said contents of surviving microorganisms, the type
and/or the doses of chemical or physical agent(s) used for said disinfecting.
Method according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the said stage 1 corresponds to a
stage before disinfecting said liquid and 
in that
 said stage 2 corresponds to any stage of said
disinfecting.
Method according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 said liquid is a liquid intended
to be in contact with a person or an animal such as bathing water, water intended for

consumption, water intended for pharmaceutical or biotechnology preparations or a
nutritional liquid.
Method according to any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that
 said putting in
contact of the microorganisms possibly present in said liquid with said substrate is achieved by

putting said liquid or a sample of said liquid in contact with said substrate.
Method according to any of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that
 said putting in
contact of the microorganisms possibly present in said liquid, or sample of liquid, with said

substrate is achieved by putting a filtrate or a residue from centrifugation of said liquid or 
sample of liquid, into contact with said substrate.
Method according to any of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that
 said liquid, sample of
liquid or concentrate, undergoes, prior to said measurements of the activity of at least one

enzyme, a lysis treatment, in particular by sonication.
Method according to any of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that
 the enzyme(s) of
which the activity/activities is/are measured has/have, in said liquid, sample of liquid or

concentrate, an affine ratio between characteristic activity and initial activity with an
inclination significantly removed from zero, preferably lower than -0.2, with the content of

surviving microorganisms on at least one value zone of said content of surviving
microorganisms.
Method according to any of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that
 the enzyme, or at
least one of the enzymes, of which the activity/activities is/are measured is a glucose-6-phosphate

dehydrogenase, a malate dehydrogenase, a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase, a catalase, a superoxide dismutase, or a glutathione reductase.
Method according to any of claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that
 said measurements of
characteristic activity and initial activity are made with a spectrophotometer, a

spectrofluorometer, or a luminometer optionally having a plurality of analysis ducts.
Method according to any of claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that
 said translating into
contents of surviving microorganisms with said reference system comprises, for each

enzyme, calculation of the ratio between characteristic activity and initial activity, optionally
expressed as a percentage.
Method according to any of claims 1 to 10, 
characterised in that
 said reference
system is presented in graphic form such as one or a plurality of curve(s) showing, for each

enzyme, said ratio between characteristic activity and initial activity corresponding to the
content of surviving microorganism values. 
Method according to any of claims 9 to 11, 
characterised in that
 said spectrometric
measurements are obtained for each enzymatic activity measured, at constant temperature, in

particular at 25 Â°C and at constant wavelength, in particular at a wavelength between 240 and
550 nm, for example at 340 nm.
Method according to any of claims 9 to 12, 
characterised in that
 said spectrometric
measurements are obtained continuously or discretely over a time interval of about 30

minutes.
Method according to any of claims 1 to 13, 
characterised in that
 said adjustment of
the doses of chemical or physical agent(s) is made by adding the equivalent "dose of

disinfectant(s)" corresponding to the difference between the content of surviving
microorganisms observed and the content of microorganisms measured in said liquid, liquid

sample, or concentrate.
Method according to claim 14, 
characterised in that
 said equivalent dose of
disinfectant(s) is as read from a reference curve showing the content of surviving

microorganisms as a function of the dose of disinfectant(s) to which said liquid is exposed.
Method according to any of claims 1 to 15, 
characterised in that
 said liquid
comprises microorganisms selected from among the group made up of the type 
Escherichia,
Alcaligenes, Bacillus, Flavobacterium, Methylobacterium, Pseudomonas, Klebsiella,

Enterobacterium, Agrobacterium, Streptococcus, Micrococcus, Salmonella

characterised in that
 said content of
surviving microorganisms is expressed as a reduction value (concentration of surviving

microorganisms as a function of the initial concentration of surviving microorganisms as
measured at said stage 1 from reduction log (-log
10
 (reduction)) or from index D (= reduction
log). 
Method according to any of claims 1 to 18, 
characterised in that
 said surviving
microorganisms are cultivatable microorganisms and/or microorganisms which are non-cultivatable
