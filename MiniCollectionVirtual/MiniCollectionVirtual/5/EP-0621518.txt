Watch case including a caseband (1,2) into 
which a crystal (3) is fitted, a detachable bezel (4) surmounting 

the caseband and surrounding the crystal, a back 
cover (5) and means (8,9,10;11,12,13) for interlocking 

the bezel with the caseband serving conjointly for axial 
retention of said bezel on said caseband when the bezel 

is given a rotational movement relative to the caseband, 
characterized by the fact that it includes blocking means 

(6) interposing between between the bezel (4) and the caseband 
(1) when a predetermined rotation angle has been 

effected by the bezel, this in order to prevent all rotational 
movement of said bezel, the blocking means including 

manual grasping means (7) enabling retraction of said blocking 
means (6), then disengagement of the bezel from the 

caseband by rotation initially and then translation. 
Watch case according to claim 1, characterized 
by the fact that the interlocking of the bezel with the 

caseband is of the bayonet type, the caseband (1) including 
one or several projections (8,9,10) distributed around 

its outer periphery and the bezel (4) one or several corresponding 
projections (11,12,13) distributed around its 

inner periphery, the upper face or faces (14) of the projection 
or projections borne by the bezel being locked under 

the lower face or faces (15) of the projection or projections 
borne by the caseband whenever the bezel is axially 

retained on the caseband, and that the blocking means 
include a finger (16) traversing the caseband (1,2) in 

the direction of its height and adapted to fit into a seat 
(17,18,19) formed in the bezel for preventing rotation 

thereof. 
Watch case according to claim 2, characterized 
by the fact that the bezel (4) and the caseband (1) each 

bear three projections (11,12,13;8,9,10) and that the bezel  
 

comprises three seats (17,18,19) uniformly distributed 
on its inner periphery, said seats being arranged between 

the projections (11,12,13) of the bezel and the finger 
(16) being arranged between two projections (9,10) of the 

caseband (1). 
Watch case according to claim 2, characterized 
by th
e fact that the finger (16) includes a head (20) at 
one of its ends and a tongue (7) forming grasping and stopping 

means at its other end, said finger being adapted to 
slide within a bore (21) formed in the caseband (2) against 

the return force of a spring (22) placed in said bore and 
under the head (20) of the finger, the travel of the finger 

being arranged to disengage completely said head from the 
seat (17) formed in the bezel (4) when manual traction 

is exerted on said tongue. 
Watch case according to claim 4, characterized 
by the fact that it bears lugs (23) for attaching a bracelet 

and that the bore (21) formed in the caseband (2) is located 
at the origin of one of the lugs and traverses such 

entirely. 
Watch case according to claim 1, characterized 
by the fact that it is of precious metal and that the bezel 

(4) is covered with precious stones.
