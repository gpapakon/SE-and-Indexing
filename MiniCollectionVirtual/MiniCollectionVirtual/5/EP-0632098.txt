<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to an organosilicon
resinous composition which has been found to have particular
utility as a replacement for fluoroelastomers currently used
as lubricants in the extrusion of thermoplastic resins.When a high molecular weight thermoplastic resin
is extruded through a die, it is known that smooth
extrudates can only be obtained up to certain shear
stresses. Beyond that, surface irregularities begin to
appear such as haze and "sharkskin". These irregularities
are known in the art and limit production rates in
commercial applications.To counteract this undesirable phenomenon, and to
enable production at higher rates, lubricants are added to
the thermoplastic resin prior to extrusion. One of the
primary functions of a lubricant is to delay, suppress or
eliminate, the onset of surface flow defects such as haze
and "sharkskin and to enable operation at higher shear
stress.Fluoroelastomers are currently used in industry as
lubricants for extruding thermoplastic resins. The addition
of 250 to 3,000 parts per million of the fluoroelastomer
lubricant, delays the onset of melt fracture to higher shear
rates and produces smoother extrudates. Typically, these
lubricants are added to the thermoplastic resin prior to
extrusion by dry blending the lubricant with the resin.We have found, however, that certain organosilicon
compounds, namely organosilicon resinous compositions, are
capable of functioning as lubricants for the extrusion of
thermoplastic resins, and are as effective, if not more
effective, than current commercial fluoroelastomeric
lubricants used by the industry. Our organosilicon resinous compositions provide a
viable alternative to the current commercial fluoroelastomeric
products and are useful in alleviating what has
heretofore been considered difficult extrusion operations.The invention introduces a method of extruding a
polyolefin thermoplastic resin in which organosilicon
resinous compositions are added to the resin prior to
extrusion and are used as lubricants for the polyolefin
thermoplastic resin.The invention also relates to a composition
including a mixture of a polyolefin thermoplastic resin and
an organosilicon resinous composition as a lubricant
therefor.According to the present invention there is
provided a method of extruding a polyolefin thermoplastic
resin in which a processing aid in the form of a lubricant
is added to the polyolefin thermoplastic resin in order to
facilitate processing of the polyolefin thermoplastic resin,
