<ABSTRACT>
A novel synthetic dioctahedral smectite layered clay, a process for preparing 
the clay and a process using the clay is disclosed. The clays that are prepared are 

gallium/silicon, gallium/germanium, or aluminum/germanium smectite clays. The 
clay is prepared from a reaction mixture containing reactive sources of the metals, 

i.e., aluminum, silicon, gallium and germanium, a templating agent and water. This 
reaction mixture is reacted at a pH of 8.5 to 14, a temperature of 150 to 210
o
C for a 
time of 1 to 20 days to give a desired composition. The clay compositions of the 

instant invention can be used to catalyze various hydrocarbon conversion processes 
such as alkylation and hydrocracking.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel synthetic dioctahedral smectite layered clay 
composition, a process far preparing the clay and a process using the clay. The clay 
is characterized in that the aluminum can be substituted by gallium and the silicon 
can be substituted by germanium. The clay is prepared from a reaction mixture 
containing reactive sources of the metals, a templating agent and water. These clays 
can catalyze reactions such as alkylation, cracking, hydrocracking, etc. Naturally occurring clays such as dioctahedral smectites are composed of 
semicrystalline aluminosilicate layers (lamellae) held together by Van der Waals and 
electrostatic forces. Anionic charges on the siliceous layers are neutralized by 
cations in the interlamellar spaces. These cations are usually sodium, calcium, or 
potassium. When these cations are large oligomers of inorganic cations such as 
Fe+3, Cr+3 or when they are metal hydroxy polymer cations such as 
[Al13O4(OH)24(H2O)12]7+ or [Zr(OH)2·4H2O]48+, they act as pillars, propping 
the clay layers apart to afford a pillared layered clay. Upon heating, these oligomers 
or polymers are converted to the metal oxide, thus preventing the collapse of the clay 
layers and pillaring the clay. These smectite clays are known to catalyze reactions such as alkylation, 
cracking, ester formation, dimerization, oligomerization, etc. However, because the 
naturally occurring clays have a large variation in impurity content, industrial demand 
for the natural smectites has been very limited. Therefore, attempts have been made 
to synthesize some of these smectite clays. For example, EP-A-163560 discloses a 
method of preparing a beidellite clay (one of the smectite clays). The process 
involves taking a mixture containing aluminum nitrate, tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS), 
sodium carbonate and sodium hydroxide, drying the mixture and then calcining to 
give aluminum oxide, silicon oxide, and sodium oxide, adding to that hydroxide 
anions and heating the resultant slurry to a temperature of 340°C for 14 days. The prior art also shows that synthetic micas can be prepared where the 
gallium is substituted for aluminum and germanium is substituted for silicon. For 
example, R. M. Barrer and L. W. R. Dicks in J. Chem. Soc.(A) (1966), 1379-1385,  
 
have reported the synthesis of micas in which the potassium counter ion is 
substituted by an ammonium counter ion, gallium is substituted for aluminum and 
germanium is substituted for silicon. Micas differ from dioctahedral smectite
