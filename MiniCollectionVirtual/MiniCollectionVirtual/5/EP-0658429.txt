<ABSTRACT>
A temperature control circuit (30, 100) regulates temperature 
in an ink-jet print head. The control circuit includes a thermal 

sensor (32) mounted on the print head to measure its temperature 
and a temperature level detector (34) to determine whether the 

measured print head temperature exceeds a threshold temperature. 
The temperature level detector (34) outputs a first signal when the 

measured print head temperature exceeds the threshold temperature 
and a second signal when the measured print head temperature does 

not exceed the threshold temperature. The control circuit also has 
first logic circuitry (42) to output warming pulses upon receipt of the 

second signal. The warming pulses have energy insufficient to deposit 
an ink drop from the print head. Second logic circuitry (52) is 

configured to output warming pulses to non-selected nozzles of the 
print head and firing pulses to selected nozzles. In this manner, the 

print head is automatically warmed via the warming pulses so long 
as the print head temperature is below a prescribed level. An 

ink-jet print head incorporating the control circuit is also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to ink-jet print heads, and more
particularly, to control circuits for operating ink-jet print heads.An ink-jet printer is a type of non-impact printer which forms
characters and other images by controllably spraying drops of ink
from a print head. The print head ejects liquid ink through multiple
nozzles in the form of annular drops which travel across a small air
gap and land on a recording media. The drops are very small as
ink-jet printers commonly print within a range of 180 to 600 dots
per inch (dpi). The ink drops dry shortly thereafter to form in
combination the desired printed images.One problem associated with ink-jet printers concerns the
amount of ink deposited from the print head during the formation
of each drop. The quantity of deposited ink, commonly referred to
as the "drop-volume" of the print head, is dependent on the
temperature of the print head. If the print head is cool, it will
deposit less ink in each droplet. Low drop-volume results in poor
quality images that appear faint or washed out. Conversely, if the
print head is too hot, it will eject more ink in each droplet. High
drop-volume increases the amount of time necessary for the image
to dry and can yield poor quality images that appear too dark or 
have poor resolution. Accordingly, it would be desirable to have the
print head deposit an optimum drop-volume while at its preferred
operating temperature.However, another printing dynamic is also involved. As a print
head is printing, its temperature will gradually rise from an initial
temperature to a steady-state operating temperature. As the print
head heats up, the amount of ink that is deposited will likewise
gradually rise. Another complicating factor is that the print head
temperature can fluctuate during each pass of the print head over
a recording media. The print head cools down during the non-printing
time between the end of the previous line and the start of
the next line. The print head then warms up again while printing
the next line.The changing print head temperature makes it difficult to
deposit a uniform and optimum amount of ink. If the nominal
drop-volume of the print head is set to yield the desired print
quality and dry times when the print head is cool, the print head
will deposit too much ink on the recording media when it warms up.
On the other hand, if the nominal drop-volume of the print head is
calibrated so that the print quality and dry times are good when the
print head is warm, the print head will eject too little ink
