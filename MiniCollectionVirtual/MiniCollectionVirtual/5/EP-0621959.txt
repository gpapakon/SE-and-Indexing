<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for detecting the mean atomic number of a mass of material, for example freight in a vehicle comprises: subjecting the mass to X-rays and determining the mean number NA passing therethrough; subjecting the mass to higher energy X-rays and determining the new mean number NB; and determining the mean atomic number of the mass from look-up tables against the computed ratio NA/NB. The mass (170), such as a railway waggon, may be scanned by two linear accelerators (162, 166) arranged perpendicular to each other, detector arrays (164, 168) being disposed respectively opposite the accelerators, so that a three dimensional image can be built up of the mass.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns X-ray inspection systems and methods of X-ray inspection by 
which the mean atomic number of material in an object under test can be determined. The 
invention is of particular application in the field of baggage and container checking at 
ports, airports, railway marshalling yards and the like. It is known to use X-rays for transmission imaging in baggage scanning facilities at 
airports and the like. For many reasons low energy X-rays have been employed hitherto. Not least of the 
reasons is the difficulty and cost of providing adequate screening for the users and the 
general public, which escalate as X-ray energies employed are increased. Other reasons 
have to do with the absorption characteristics of materials to X-rays and a greater variation 
is observed at low energies (for example up to 200KeV) than is exhibited at higher 
energies (eg above 1MeV), thereby making low energy X-ray imaging more sensitive to 
thickness differences. Unfortunately low energy X-rays cannot penetrate as well as high energy X-rays and 
whereas the former can be used to penetrate the walls and contents of briefcases and 
handbags and ordinary luggage, they are of little use when containers are steel lined or 
made of steel as for example are shipping containers, goods waggons and the like. For 
such applications only high energy X-rays (in excess of 1MeV) can be used. This has 
required massive concrete structures to provide the necessary shielding and because of the  
 
relatively small variation in absorption as between one material and another at such 
elevated energy levels, such facilities have been restricted to X-ray imaging techniques 
involving the production of a visual display (as on a VDU) of the interior of the object 
under test, which has then had to be monitored by personnel to determine if the contents 
are deemed to be hazardous or illegal. Using low energy X-rays, baggage interrogation can also include determination of the 
mean atomic number of the materials within the container scanned. This enables a mean 
atomic number profile to be generated for each item. However this technique has not 
hitherto been possible when high energy X-rays have to be employed (to penetrate the 
items under inspection) since the absorption variation at these higher energies was deemed 
not to be sufficiently great as to admit ready discrimination between one material and 
another. In European Patent Application 0390950 there is disclosed a method of determining the 
mean atomic number of a mass
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method of determining the mean atomic number of a mass of material within a 
container, comprising subjecting the material to broad band X-rays of the order of 1MeV 

and above, detecting the incident X-rays beyond the material by means of a composite 
detector (44), whereby upon bombardment by the transmitted X-rays the detector produces 

substantially simultaneously a higher order energy component than 1MeV and a lower 
order energy component of the order of 1MeV, determining from the detection the mean 

number N
A
 of X-rays having the lower order energy component transmitted through a 
region of the material, determining the mean number N
B
 of X-rays having the higher order 
energy component transmitted therethrough; computing the value of the ratio N
A
 to N
B
, 
and determining from a look-up table and delivering as an output the average atomic 

number which corresponds to the computed value of the N
A
/N
B
 ratio. 
A method according to claim 1, in which the higher order energy component has 
energies of at least 2MeV. 
A method according to claim 1 or claim 2 in which the products of Compton scattering 
in a target/convertor in the composite detector (44) and electron-positron pair production 

are detected in separate crystals (50, 52). 
A method according to claim 2 or claim 3 in which photons attributable to higher 
energy X-rays transmitted through the material are detected by detecting rearwardly 

propagated annihilation photons attributable to electron-positron pair production in the 

target/convertor, typically at an angle of 135° and greater. 
A method according to claim 3 or claim 4 in which the detection is enhanced by  
 

removing lower energy photons from the rearwardly propagating photons by filtering, as 
by using a sheet of lead or tungsten or like material, and forcing all the rearwardly 

propagating photons to pass therethrough, so that only the higher energy photons reach the 
second detector. 
Apparatus for performing the method according to claim 1 or claim 2, comprising a 
broad band X-ray source, a sandwich of absorbers and scintillators enabling an 

electromagnetic cascade to be sampled at depths from the end of the sandwich on which 
X-rays are incident, and computer means (104) for computing the value of the ratio N
A
 
to N
B
, in which the first element on which the X-ray beam impinges comprises a relatively 
thin crystal, so that the energy deposited is more or less independent of X-ray energies and 

the spectrum of sampled X-rays is therefore strongly peaked around 1MeV, and the thin 
crystal is followed by a low-atomic-number beam hardener (176) which preferentially 

removes lower energy X-rays from the beam, which is then transmitted to a series of 
high-atomic-number converters (186 to 192) which alternate with and are thereby 

sandwiched by thin crystals which sample the electrons produced by collisions upstream 
of the crystals. 
Apparatus according to claim 6 in which light from the crystals is conveyed to a 
photo-electric device using optical fibres. 
Apparatus according to claim 7 in which the outputs from all the crystals are optically 
coupled to give a single optical output to the photo-electric device. 
Apparatus for performing the method according to any one of claims 3 to 5 comprising 
a broad band X-ray source, a target/convertor, typically of tungsten, and two crystals 

located so as to separately receive forwardly propagating photons in the range 30° to 60° 
off the axis and to receive rearwardly propagating photons in the range 135° to 180° off 

the axis.

rearward direction back towards the source and up to 45° off the rearward axis, and the 
other detector (50) being positioned and adapted to detect forwardly propagating X-rays 

scattered off-axis by more than 30° and by less than 60° thereto due to Compton scatter, 
each of the X-ray detectors providing signals proportional to the number of X-ray photons 

(48) incident thereon; the said computer means (104) responsive to the two detector 
outputs forming a ratio of the number of photons detected by the two detectors and 

forming a numerical value thereof; a look-up table containing information pertaining to 
given numerical ratios for different materials; means for determining from the look-up 

table the atomic number corresponding to the numerical ratio obtained from the outputs 
of the two detectors; and means for delivering the said information as an output signal. 
Apparatus according to claim 10 in which the target is formed from tungsten, and the 
X-ray detectors (50,52) are crystals of zinc tungstate or cadmium tungstate, the X-ray 

photons being converted by the crystals into electromagnetic radiation in the visible range, 
and the photons of visible light being detected and quantified using a photo-electric sensor 

adapted to generate from the light emitted from the crystal an electric current which can 
be measured to give a numerical value proportional to the X-ray photon population 

incident on the appropriate crystal. 
Apparatus according to claim 10 or claim 11 in which the X-ray source is a 
conventional 10MeV electron linear accelerator with targets and beam hardeners to 

determine the X-ray spectrum emanating therefrom.

(44) are positioned in an array in the same vertical plane on the remote side of a testing 

station (32) each pointing towards the source and preferably to the point from which the 
fan of X-rays emanates, and each distanced therefrom by approximately the same length, 

the two X-ray sensitive crystals (50, 52) associated with each detector being separately 
addressable to determine the photon population seen by them, for determining the ratio as  

 
aforesaid for each detector, means being provided for memorising the ratio obtained from 

each detector to enable a profile to be produced of all of the ratios seen by all of the 
detectors in the array. 
Apparatus according to any one of claims 10 to 13 further comprising means for 
introducing relative movement between the analysis device and the object, generally 

perpendicular to the plane of the X-ray beam, so that the object can effectively be scanned 
from one end to the other, and means for memorising the signals obtained during the 

lengthwise scanning, so that a two-dimensional profile can be obtained for the whole 
object as viewed by the detector.
