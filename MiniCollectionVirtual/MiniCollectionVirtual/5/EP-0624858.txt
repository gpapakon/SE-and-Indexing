<ABSTRACT>
A method is described for detecting discontinuous, irregular movements of persons. According to the invention, the method comprises the following procedural steps:   - detecting the movements of a person with the generation of signals,     - working out the signals such that they are matched to a timer;   - comparison of the generated signals in the timer, - transmission of the signals to a display installation when signals are present which deviate from preset values.
