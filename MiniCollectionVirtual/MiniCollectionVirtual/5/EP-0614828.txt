<ABSTRACT>
The valve comprises a rigid frame (10) with walls (12) defining a 
passage mouth (8) for the material and a valving member (9) in the 

form of a flat horizontal plate; the valving member (9) is movable 
horizontally through a slot (13) provided in a wall (12a) and is 

of such a size as to close the passage mouth (8); an elastomeric 
material gasket means (20) in the form of a closed ring is fixed 

to the frame (10) and extends along the upper peripheral edge of 
the passage mouth (8); when viewed in vertical cross-section, the 

gasket means (20) comprises a lip (21) which projects downwards 
towards the interior of the mouth (8) and is in contact with the 

upper surface of the valving member (9) when this is inserted into 
the passage mouth (8).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a slide valve for material in
powder or small-piece form.A typical application of the valve in object is on the
lower surface of silos or below a hopper for intercepting
the descent of the material.In particular the invention relates to a valve comprising,
in combination: a rigid frame with vertical walls
defining a passage mouth for the material, having two
straight lateral walls parallel one to the other; a flat horizontal
plate, defining a valving member to close the
passage mouth, horizontally movable through a slot
provided in a wall, said plate sliding along said lateral
walls, the width of the plate being equal to the distance
between the lateral walls; an elastomeric material gasket
means in a form of a closed ring fixed to the frame
and extending along the upper peripheral edge of the
passage mouth, said gasket means comprising, when
viewed in section, a lip which projects downward toward
the interior of the mouth in contact with the upper surface
of the plate, the outer surface of the lip converging
downwardly toward the center of the passage mouth,
over the upper edge surface of the plate.A technical problem connected with such valves is
to prevent the material seeping beyond the valving
member when this is in its closure position and to also
prevent the material seeping through the passage slot
for the valving member when this is at rest and is then
pulled rearwards. This problem is exacerbated by the
fact that said valves are generally of relatively very large
dimensions (the mouth usually has dimensions exceeding
15 cm x 15 cm) and therefore require robust components
formed by structural steel working, their parts in
addition generally operating in the presence of material
which can be very abrasive.FR-A-2640598 discloses a valve of the above type.
The peculiar structure of the valve shown in FR-A-2640598
is such that in the region of the passage mouth
the valving member, namely the horizontal plate, is not
supported by anything but the lower gasket means. So,
when the mouth is relatively very large, as in the case
the valve is put under big silos, and the powder material
is relatively heavy, then the horizontal plate is subjected
to a relatively high weight which is opposed only by the
gasket means. So the gasket means, being made of an
elastomeric material, will be compressed and the horizontal
plate will unavoidably sink in the vertical direction,
and the powder material will seep out, so the main
function of the valve is lacking.An object of the present

<CLAIMS>
A slide valve for material in powder or small-piece form, comprising, in combination:

a rigid frame (10) with vertical walls (12) defining a passage mouth (8) for the material, having

two straight lateral walls (12) parallel one to the other;
a flat horizontal plate (9), defining a valving member to close the passage mouth, horizontally
movable through a slot (13) provided in a wall (12a), sliding along said lateral walls (12), the

width of the plate (9) being equal to the distance between the lateral walls (12), during said
movement the plate being guided by idle wheels (6) pivotably fixed to the lateral walls (12),

each idle wheel (6) being rotatable around its axis, the idle wheels (6) acting against the lower
edge surface of the plate (9);
an elastomeric material gasket means (20) in the form of a closed ring fixed to the frame (10)
and extending along the upper peripheral edge of the passage mouth (8), said gasket means

comprising, when viewed in section, a lip (21) which projects downwards towards the interior
of the mouth (8) in contact with the upper surface of the plate (9), the outer surface of the lip

(21) converging downwardly toward the center of the passage mouth, over the upper edge
surface of the plate (9), in a closure position the plate (9) being inserted into the mouth (8) into

contact with the lip (21) and this being urged upwards and by reaction pressing against the
plate (9) with a certain preload;

   
characterised in that
:

the whole lip (21), in its rest state, projects downwards slightly beyond an ideal plane in which
the upper surface of the plate (9) moves;
in said closure position, the plate (9) is supported by at least the farthest said idle wheels (6)
from the wall (12a) carrying said slot (13) and its upper surface is located in the same ideal

plane in which the upper surface moves.
A valve as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised in that
 said lip (21) comprises along its lower
surface one or more longitudinal recesses (23) to increase the sealing action of the lip (21).
A valve as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised by
 comprising a gasket (26) fixed to a wall (12a)
of the frame (10) below the valving member (9) and extending along the slot (13) traversed by

this latter, said gasket (26) having an upper lip in contact with the lower surface of the valving
member (9) and arranged to scrape said lower surface when the valving member (9) is retracted

outwards from the mouth (8).
A valve as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised in that
 said gasket means (20) comprises a
horizontal flat rim (22) fixed to a corresponding upper horizontal rim (14) provided in the 

frame (10), the lip (21) being joined to said flat rim (22).
A valve as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the upper surface of the valving member
(9) is of elastomeric material of greater hardness than the gasket means (20).
A valve as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised in that
 said gasket means (20) is formed by direct
moulding onto the rigid frame (10).
A valve as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised in that
 said gasket means (20) comprises, on that
wall (12) opposite the wall (12a) carrying said slot (13), a substantially vertical appendix (24)

which adheres to said wall (12) and projects downwards below the lip (21), the front edge (9')

A valve as claimed in claim 1 where said frame (10) lies substantially horizontally,

characterised in that
 the valving member (9) lies and slides in a plane inclined downwards from

of the gasket means (20) having an upper surface (21') inclined downwards towards the centre

A valve as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised in that
 in plan view the passage mouth (8)
comprises a convex arched side (8a) opposite that side comprising the passage slot (13), the
