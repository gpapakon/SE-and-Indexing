<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a sun visor for vehicles having a sun-visor body (1) and a sun-visor spindle (2), which is seated with an end region in a bearing housing (3) inserted in the sun-visor body (1) and is clamped by spring means, the sun-visor spindle (2) having over an axial region which corresponds with the spring means, a flattened portion (8) as end-latching means. Over the axial region which is provided with the flattened portion (8) it is provided that the sun-visor spindle (2) has regions of different diameter and, in this connection, starting from a longitudinal edge (9) of the flattened portion (8) is designed such that it is circular over a first circumferential region and, connected thereto, such that it decreases in diameter in a spiral-shaped manner over a second circumferential region towards the other longitudinal edge (11) of the flattened portion (8).

A sun visor for vehicles composed of a sun 
visor body (1) and a sun visor axle (2), which is 

supported with an end part in a support housing (3) 
which is supported in the sun visor body (1) and 

which is clamped by spring means, in order to 
maintain the sun visor body (1) in desired positions 

between a position of non-use beneath the roof of the 
vehicle and a position of use facing the windshield, 

whereby the sun visor axle (2) comprises in an axial 
part coupled with the spring means a flat part (8) as 

an end-detent, which entails that the sun visor body 
(1) in the position of non-use is secured against an 

unwanted tilting movement, characterized in that the 
sun visor axle (2) comprises on the axial part 

provided with the flat part (8), areas of different 
diameter and in that it has, beginning from a 

longitudinal edge (9) of the flat part (8), along a 
first peripheral part, a semicircular shape and then, 

along a second peripheral part, a spiral shape, 
whose diameter decreases towards the other 

longitudinal edge (11) of the flat part (8). 
Sun visor according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the second peripheral part of the sun visor axle 

(2), whose diameter decreases along a spiral, is  
 

connected to the flat part (8) by way of a radius 
(R). 
Sun visor according to claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the second peripheral part of the sun visor 

axle (2), whose diameter decreases along a spiral, 
extends along approximately a 90 degree angle.
