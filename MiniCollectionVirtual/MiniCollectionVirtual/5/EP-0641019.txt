<ABSTRACT>
A polymer lead frame is made from a flexible substrate 
(24) with flexible conductive traces (26). The generally 

square lead frame has diagonal cut-outs (42-48) partially 
extending from the corners towards the centre, as well as a 

central hole (62) that lies within a footprint of a die. The 
die (22) is bonded directly to the lead frame, preferably with 

anisotropic, electrically conductive adhesive (32). The die 
is placed with the lead frame in a fixture. A holding force 

is applied to secure the die and, if necessary, a curing force 
is applied during a cure cycle. The fixture allows transport 

of the assembly to a curing oven and allows application of the 
curing force. The die has contact pads characterised by a 

non-planar, non-bumplike surface with concavities having 
depths of at least one-seventh the diameter of conductive 

particles in the anisotropic conductive adhesive.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the general field 
of die bonding, and in particular to a die and lead 
frame assemblies. Traditionally, most integrated circuits 
(IC's) have been connected using three metal 
connections. First, the die is wire-bonded to a 
lead-frame. Wire bonding connects one end of a fine 
metallic wire to an IC contact pad. The other end of 
the wire is connected to a metal lead-frame. The IC 
and part of the lead-frame are then sealed into a 
molded package to produce the well-known IC package. 
The leads of the package are then soldered to the 
circuit to produce a third connection. So-called Chip-On-Board methods are similar 
to wire bonding but without a lead-frame. A bare die 
is first attached to a circuit board with pads facing 
away from the board. A drawn wire is then metal 
bonded to each IC pad and to a corresponding circuit 
board pad, then the assembly is encapsulated. Tape Automated Bonding (TAB) is another 
connection methodology which produces a similar 
result to wire bonding. Metal foil laminated on a 
substrate is typically etched in a patterned array to 
form traces on a dielectric film. The copper traces  
 
typically extend over an opening which is sized to be 
slightly larger than the die. These extended 
portions are sometimes called fingers. The die is 
placed in the opening so that fingers can be metal-bonded 
to die contact pads. Ends of the traces away 
from the fingers can be connected to a substrate 
using other methods. The bonds from the copper trace 
to the die are sometimes called inner bonds, while 
the bonds from the copper trace to the substrate are 
sometimes called outer bonds. TAB is similar to wire 
bonding in that one end of a metal wire (etched 
trace) connects to the die while another end is 
attached to a circuit board. Yet another approach solders dies directly 
to ceramic circuit boards, and is sometimes called a 
"flip chip" process. Rounded solder bumps are 
specially fabricated on the chip contact pads. A 
rigid substrate is provided with a matched set of 
contact points. After placing the chip, bumps down, 
on the substrate, the solder is reflowed. Anisotropic conductive adhesives (sometimes 
called Z-axis adhesives) displaying unidirectional 
conductivity have been reported for outer bonds in a 
TAB process. The adhesive consists of a dielectric 
thermoplastic adhesive and nickel conductive 
particles. See "Direct Chip Interconnect Using  
 
Polymer Bonding," K. Gilleo, 1989, presented at the IEFE 39th 
Electronic Components Conference.
