<ABSTRACT>
A drug delivery device comprising a polymer matrix and a drug contained in or surrounded by the matrix which polymer matrix is a cross-linked hydrogel matrix comprising a dextranase degradable polymer and a cross-linking agent providing covalent bonded network linkage between the polymer chains. The device is suitable for delivering drug to the colon. A method of making the device comprising: (a) dissolving a dextranase degradable polymer in a solvent; (b) adding a cross linking agent capable of cross-linking the polymer with covalent bonds to the solution; (c) allowing the cross-linking agent to react with the dextranase degradable polymer to provide a cross-linked hydrogel matrix, and loading the drug into said solution before or after the reaction between the polymer and the cross-linking agent has finished.

<DESCRIPTION>
A drug delivery device and a method of making such deviceThe present invention relates to drug delivery devices for delivering drugs to the colon and comprising a polymer matrix and a drug contained in or surrounded by the matrix.A large number of drugs are very sensitive to proteolytic enzymes contained in the digestive juices of the stomach and the small intestine. Drugs, such as peptides and proteins, are degraded by the proteolytic enzymes, thus reducing the absorption substantially.Though oral administration is much more convenient and acceptable to the patient, the most common mode of delivering drugs, such as peptides and proteins, is by parental administration.Investigations have shown that the concentration of pro¬ teolytic enzymes in the colon juices is much lower than the concentration in the juices of the stomach and the small intestine.It would therefore be very advantageous to find a suit¬ able technique for delivering drugs selectively to the colon by administration through the alimentary canal.Polymeric materials such as hydrogels have been widely used in drug carrier systems for controlled release or used as stimuli sensitive devices. Such devices are for instance described in "Hydrogels in Medicine and Pharm¬ acy", N.A. Peppas (Ed.), CRC Press, 1987. The formula¬ tions described therein are generally not biodegradable. The release of pharmacologically active agents "loaded" into such gels is typically controlled by simple diffu¬ sion in the device which depends on the water content in 

the gel. These gels are therefore not suitable for drug delivery to specific regions of the intestines after oral administration.EP Patent Application 357 401 discloses a biodegradable hydrogel matrix comprising a protein, a polysaccharide, and a cross-linking agent. However, this composition is not used for oral administration.US Patent 4 024 073 discloses a hydrogel composition comprising a water-soluble polymer containing a chelating agent bound to the polymer chain, and a polyvalent metal ion cross-linking the polymer molecules through the chelating agent. The hydrogel is useful as a carrier for timed release of drugs and medicaments and is not targeted to the colon.JP Patents 1 156 912, JP 62 010 012, JP 5 721 315, DE Publication 3 400 106 and US Patent 4 496 553 describe the preparation of compressed tablets for slow-release of drugs using soluble polymers or polysaccharides. These are all conventional tablets disintegrating in a time- dependent fashion and are not specifically targeted to the
