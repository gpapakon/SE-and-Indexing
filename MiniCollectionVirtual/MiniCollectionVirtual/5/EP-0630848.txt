<ABSTRACT>
A hydraulic elevator-translator, and a procedure 
for elevation and translation. A cabin (2) for 

transporting personnel and/or goods is freely 
slidable along fixed vertical guides for movement 

in a straight direction. Two cable blocks (6, 7), 
of which one cable block (6) is fixed and one (7) 

is mobile slidingly along fixed guides (9) for 
movement in a straight direction, are each 

provided with at least one pulley pair (10). Two 
cables (8), wound about the pulley pairs (10), 

each have one end anchored to the fixed cable 
block (6), and another end anchored to the cabin 

(2). Pistons (3) of two fixed hydraulic cylinders 
(4) have stems which are fixed by upper ends to 

the mobile cable block (7).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a hydraulic elevator and 
translator and an elevation-translation procedure. 
Specifically, though not exclusively, such devices 
are applied in the field of vertical transport of 
people or goods, in the form of personnel or goods 
elevators. They can also be used as translators, 
however, for inclined or horizontal transport. Winch elevators are already well known, having an 
upper chamber for housing the winch and a further 
inspection chamber below the bottom endrun, 
situated below the passenger cabin. Such elevators are considerably expensive and 
require two extra chambers at the two ends of the 
run. Hydraulic chambers are also known, also for 
transport of people or objects, which are operated 
by a hydraulic machine constituted by one or more 
pistons, slidable inside fixed cylinders located 
below or lateral to the cabin. In such known solutions the piston run for lifting  
 
the cabin is generally equal to the run of the 
cabin itself. This represent a great limit to the 
useful lift run length. The length of the piston, 
in consequence of the fact that it works by 
compression, is greatly limited by mechanical 
stress resistance problems. Further, in order to 
limit the longitudinal mass of the hydraulic 
machine, somewhat complex constructional solutions 
are adopted, such as, for example, telescopic 
pistons. A main aim of the present invention is to overcome 
the abovementioned limits and drawbacks, by 
providing a hydraulic elevator-translator which is 
constructively simple and economical, and which is 
reliable and safe over relatively long elevator 
runs. A further aim is to provide an elevation-translation 
procedure which allows considerable 
economical savings. One advantage of the present invention is that the 
hydraulic piston is not subject to compression 
stress during cabin movement. A further advantage is that the invention provides 
a hydraulic elevator-translator having several 
important characteristics of the winch-type  
 
elevator, as it can perform long runs, but which 
does not need a large space for location and 
maintenance of the winch mechanism, nor are 
pulleys needed above the cabin, nor, finally, must 
there be a bottom endrun chamber. The above aims and advantages and more besides are 
all attained by the elevator-translator of the 
invention, as it is characterized in the 
accompanying claims, in which the load transport 
cabin is connected to at least one hydraulic 
piston by a hoist, thanks to which hoist the run 
of the cabin can

<CLAIMS>
A hydraulic elevator-translator comprising: 

a cabin (2) for transporting personnel and/or 
goods, freely slidable along fixed guides for 

movement in a straight direction; 
hydraulic drive means for displacing the cabin 
(2); 
 
characterised in that it comprises: 


two cable blocks (6, 7), each provided with at 
least one pulley pair (10), of which one cable 

block (6) is fixed and one (7) is mobile slidingly 
along fixed guides (9) for movement in a straight 

direction; 
at least one cable (8), wound about the pulley 
pair (10), having one end anchored to one of the 

two cable blocks (6, 7), and another end anchored 
to the cabin (2); 
at least one fixed hydraulic cylinder (4) in 
which a piston (3) runs, a stem of said piston (3) 

being fixed by an upper end to the mobile cable 
block (7). 
An elevator-translator as in claim 1, 
characterised in that each cable block (6, 7) 

comprises two aligned pulley pairs (10) about 
which two cables (8) wind, each of the cables (8) 

having one end anchored to the fixed cable block 
(6). 
An elevator-translator as in claim 1, 
characterised in that the hydraulic cylinder (4) 

and the mobile cable block (7), together with the 
guides (9), are laterally arranged with respect to 

the cabin (2). 
An elevator-translator as in claim 1, wherein the 
pistons (3) are fixed to the mobile cable block 

(7) such as to operate in traction during a 
lifting of the cabin (2). 
A procedure of elevation-translation for elevating 
and translating a cabin (2) or vehicle suitable 

for transport of personnel and/or goods, freely 
slidable along fixed guides for movement in a 

straight direction, characterised in that an 
active phase of elevation or translation is 

performed by hydraulic means operating in 
 

traction. 
A procedure as in claim 5, wherein the vehicle is 
commanded to move by hydraulic pistons working in 

traction and with a multiplied vehicle run with 
respect to a run of the pistons, according to 

directions which are not necessarily vertical and 
which comprise movements in two opposite 

directions.
