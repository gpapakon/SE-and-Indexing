<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for control of a fluorescent microdot screen consisting of pixels arranged into L rows and M columns of images capable of taking a discrete number of Q grey shades, in which the column voltage values are chosen in a strictly increasing series of N+1 values such that, with the row selection times being subdivided into S equal time intervals  DELTA t, each voltage value is applied a whole number of times  DELTA t, (NxS)+1 representing the number of grey levels, with N 
>
/= 2 and S 
>
/= 2. During a row selection time, the corresponding column voltage takes a first value Va for a certain number of time intervals  DELTA t, then, if appropriate, during the remaining time intervals at most one second value Vb following the first one in the series of N voltages. The invention also relates to a control device for such a screen.
