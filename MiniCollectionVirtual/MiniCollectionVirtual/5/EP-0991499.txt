<ABSTRACT>
An abrasive surface for cutting and grinding tools and having abrasive particles embedded in a filler material. The abrasive surface is bonded to the perimeter edge of a rigid hub and has a circumferential dimension and a width dimension. The abrasive surface is divided along both the circumferential dimension and the width dimension into a plurality of hard regions and soft regions. The hard regions wear more slowly that the soft regions and so different patterns of hard regions and soft regions produce different cutting profiles. A method for fabricating the abrasive surface includes forming a laminated sheet from a plurality of laminated layers. Each laminated layer includes at least a layer of soft, easily deformable material and a layer of abrasive particles. The layers of abrasive particles can be formed into staggered rows to form the pattern of hard regions and soft regions. The layers of the laminated layers are sintered together to form the laminated sheet from which the abrasive surface is cut.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to cutting and grinding tools. In
particular the present invention includes a superabrasive surface for use with
circular cutting and grinding tools and a method for making the same.Materials such as granite, marble, filled concrete, asphalt and the like are
typically cut using superabrasive saw blades. These blades include a circular
steel disc having a work surface made up of a plurality of spaced segments
about the perimeter of the disk, the segments having superabrasive surfaces for
the cutting of the material. Further, plastic and glass lenses for optical devices
such as eyeglasses are commonly shaped using grinding wheels which have a
superabrasive work surface. The abrasive portions of these saw blades or
grinding wheels usually include particles of super hard or abrasive material, such
as diamond, cubic boron nitride, or boron suboxide surrounded by a filler
material and/or embedded in a metal matrix. It is these abrasive particles that
act to cut or grind a work piece as it is placed against a rotating work surface of
the cutting or grinding tool.The arrangement of the particles of abrasive material in the work surface
is important to performance of the cutting or grinding tool. First, an unvarying
or homogeneous concentration or hardness of abrasive material in a direction
along the circumference of the cutting surface results in reduced cutting
performance. As such it is advantageous to be able to vary the concentration or
hardness of abrasive particles in the cutting surface to produce a surface of
varying abrasiveness. For example, Fisher, in U.S. Patent No. 5,518,443 for a
Superabrasive Tool issued May 21, 1996, discloses a tool having a cutting
surface divided in the circumferential direction into segments having varying 
concentrations of abrasive particles. Regions of lower concentration of abrasive
material will wear faster than regions of higher concentrations of abrasive
particles exposing fresh high concentration regions. These fresh regions cut
more effectively than worn regions of higher concentration of cutting material
thereby increasing the cutting performance of the tool.Second, it is known in the art to form cutting surfaces in which the
concentration of abrasive particles in the cutting surface varies in a direction of
the axis of rotation of the abrasive tool. For example, Wiand, in U.S. Patent
No. 4,131,436 for Ophthalmic Flat Roughing Wheel, issued December 26,
1978, discloses a grinding wheel in which the concentration of abrasive

<CLAIMS>
A tool for cutting and grinding comprising:

an abrasive work surface having a circumferential dimension orthogonal
to an axial dimension;
a plurality of first regions spaced in the circumferential dimension and
the axial dimension on the abrasive work surface; and
a plurality of second regions spaced in the circumferential dimension and
the axial dimension on the abrasive work surface;

wherein the work surface is divided in the axial dimension into a
plurality of layers extending in the circumferential dimension and

orthogonal to the axial dimension; and

wherein each first region is more wear resistant than each second region
such that each second region will wear faster than each first

region.
The tool of claim 1 wherein a first exterior layer forms a first external
edge of the work surface, a second external layer forms a second external edge

of the work surface, and a plurality of interior layers are located between the
first exterior layer and the second exterior layer.
The tool of claim 2 wherein each of the plurality of interior layers is
divided along the circumferential direction into first regions and second regions

and the first exterior layer includes only a first region and the second exterior
layer includes only a first region.
The tool of claim 3 wherein each layer has substantially the same width.
The tool of claim 4 wherein the first regions and the second regions of
the interior layers are all of approximately equal circumferential length and the 

first regions and the second regions of adjacent interior layers are offset from
each other along the circumferential dimension by a distance equal to the

circumferential length of each first region.
The tool of claim 5 including anywhere from one to seven, interior layers.
The tool of claim 1 wherein the first regions and the second regions
include abrasive particles.
The tool of claim 1 wherein the abrasive particles included in each first
region are harder than the abrasive particles included in each second region.
The tool of claim 1 wherein the concentration of abrasive particles
included in each first region is higher than the concentration of abrasive particles

included in each second region.
