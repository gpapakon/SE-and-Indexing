<ABSTRACT>
A reflector for a mirror is made in a mould 
comprising a first mould half (10) and a second mould half 

(12). Flexible sheet material (22), having a reflective 
surface, is placed in the second mould half (12) with the 

reflective surface facing the first mould half (10). 
Synthetic material, which is transparent to visible light, 

is then injected into the cavity (16) in the first mould 
half (10) to form a rigid body (26) with the reflective 

surface abutting one surface thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of making a 
reflector in a mould comprising a first mould half and a 
second mould half, the method comprising positioning 
flexible sheet material having a reflective surface in the 
second mould half and injecting synthetic material into the 
first mould half to form a rigid body with the reflective 
surface abutting one surface thereof. GB-A-2165182 discloses a method of making a 
reflector for lighting apparatus in this way. The present 
invention is concerned with making a reflective member for 
a mirror assembly, especially a vehicle mirror assembly. According to the invention, in a method of the 
type described above, the flexible sheet material is placed 
in the second mould half with its reflective surface facing 
the first mould half and the material injected into the 
first mould half is transparent to visible light. Preferably the body having a reflective surface is 
a thin film of flexible plastics material. In one form of the invention, the flexible 
plastics material is in the form of an elongate web which 
is positioned across a mould half comprising a 
substantially flat surface and a succession of rigid bodies 
are moulded onto the web which is advanced across the 
surface of the flat mould half between each injection 
operation. Alternatively, the flexible plastics material may 
be preformed into discrete parts which are individually 
positioned in the mould before each injection operation. The invention is particularly applicable to the 
production of mirrors where the transparent substrate 
carrying the reflective layer is required to be of a shape 
which is difficult or expensive to produce from glass. For 
example, the invention may be used to produce reflective 
prisms for dipping interior mirrors for vehicles. It may 
be also be used to produce curved mirrors, particularly 
aspheric mirrors. Embodiments of the invention will now be  
 
described, by way of example, with reference to the 
accompanying drawings, in which: 
Figure 1 is a sectional view of a mould, in 
accordance with a first embodiment of the invention, in its 
closed state prior to the injection of the transparent 
plastics material; Figure 2 is a cross-sectional view similar to 
Figure 1, but with the mould open after the injection phase 
has been completed; and Figure 3 is a side view of a reflective prism 
produced in the mould shown in Figures 1 and 2; Figure 4 is a sectional view of a mould, in 
accordance with another embodiment of the invention, with 
the mould halves
