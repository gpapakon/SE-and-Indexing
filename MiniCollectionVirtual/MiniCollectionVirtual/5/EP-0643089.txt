<ABSTRACT>
In a process for producing an amorphous thermoplastic 
resin composition comprising melt-kneading at least one 

amorphous thermoplastic resin, an improvement comprising melt-kneading 
the amorphous thermoplastic resin in the presence of 

not less than 1% by weight, based on the amorphous 
thermoplastic resin, of an organic solvent in a kneader having 

a vent hole(s) while maintaining at least one vent hole of the 
kneader under reduced pressure by means of an evacuator to 

remove the organic solvent so as to reduce the organic solvent 
content in the final composition to less than 1% by weight. 

Thermal deterioration of the resin during melt-kneading can be 
inhibited to provide a resin composition having well-balanced 

impact resistance and heat resistance and excellent hue.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for producing a
polymer blend having improved properties. More particularly,
it relates to an improvement in a process for producing a resin
composition comprising melt-kneading at least two kinds of
amorphous thermoplastic resins in the presence of an organic
solvent.Amorphous thermoplastic resins are generally melt-kneaded
at temperatures higher than the melting point or glass
transition point. Melt-kneading is attended by shear heat
generation, which accelerates thermal deterioration of the
resin, such as gelation and carbonization, and the resulting
resin composition has reduced moldability or provides moldings
with poor appearance or deteriorated impact resistance.Approaches to inhibit shear heat generation during
melt-kneading include (1) reduction of the cylinder temperature
of a melt-kneader, (2) reduction of the number of rotation of
a melt-kneader, (3) reduction of the viscosity of the
composition by, for example, addition of a plasticizer, (4)
reduction of the degree of polymerization of the resin, and (5)
addition of a soft-flow polymer.Methods (1) and (2) are not always effective due to
limitations of performance of a kneader, such as a cooling 
system or a motor torque. Method (3) is successful in
controlling thermal deterioration but often with the result
that the characteristics essential to the resin, particularly
heat resistance, are impaired. Methods (4) and (5) cost the
final composition the mechanical strength.EP-A-0 246 358 reveals a process for preparing thermoplastic
polyphenylene ether containing moulded articles by melt-mixing
the components. A PPE-melt containing at least 0,1 %
of volatile components is degased so that the residual
content of the volatile components is less than 500 ppm.EP-A-0 126 972 describes a process for preparing
polyphenylene ether containing moulded articles, in two
steps. In the first step, a 5 to 50 % by weight solution of
polyphenylene ether is concentrated. Then, it is mixed with a
melt of another polymer in a mixing zone having a shear rate
of 5 to 400s-1. In the second process step, the content of
the residual solvent is reduced to less than 0.1 % by weight.As a result of extensive investigations, the present
inventors have found that amorphous thermoplastic resins can be
prevented from thermal deterioration during melt-kneading by
conducting the melt-kneading in the presence of an organic
solvent while maintaining at least one vent hole of a kneader
under reduced pressure so as to finally reduce the organic
solv
