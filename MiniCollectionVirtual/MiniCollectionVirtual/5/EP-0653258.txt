<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to forging machines which are provided with, in particular, four rams fitted with tools, which are arranged offset at 90 DEG  to one another in an x shape in one plane and act radially on the workpiece, which is guided longitudinally along the system axis, actuating devices acting on tool carriages being provided for the adjustment of the tools relative to the rams in accordance with the stroke end position of the rams. The known actuating devices are subject to the disadvantage that the connection between the actuating devices and their drives must be provided with couplings or geared connections which compensate for the ram stroke. The invention counters the disadvantage described above by the fact that the drives (23) of the actuating devices (19-22) are mounted on the rams (2) and that pull-/push-rod (22) or rotary linkages are provided as drive connections to the actuating devices (1922), mounted on the ram end plates (18), for the transverse adjustment of the tools (3). In particular, linear-stroke drives (23) are provided, these interacting with pull-/push-rod linkages (22) as drive connections and bell-crank lever mechanisms (19, 20, 21) as actuating devices (1922).

A forging machine with four rams (2, 42) which are arranged in a cruciform manner in 
one plane, are offset at 90Â° to one another, act radially upon the workpiece guided 

longitudinally in the system axis (
S
) and are equipped with tools (3, 43), wherein the 
rams (2, 42) are guided in the machine frame (1, 41), form cylinders (44b) open 

towards the outside from the system axis (
S
) or are connected to such cylinders (4, 4b) 
and are adjustable in their respective stroke-end position by displacement means (27 to 

29; 35 to 39; 49 to 51), and wherein the tools (3, 43) transversely displaceable in their 
common plane by means of tool supports (17, 57) on the rams (2, 42) can be set and 

fixed by displacement devices (19 to 21; 59 to 61), acting upon the supports (17; 57) 

by way of drive connexions (22, 62) situated adjacent to the rains (2, 42) on the outside, 
as a function of the setting of the end position of the stroke of the rams (2, 42), in 

such a way that the tools (3, 43), which with the part of their operating face exceeding 
the pass-contour dimension are covered by a lateral face of an adjacent tool (3, 43), 

form a closed pass contour in their respective stroke-end positions, 
characterized in 
that
 the drives (23; 33, 34; 63) of the displacement devices (19 to 22 [
sic
 - 
recte
 21]; 

59 to 61) with drive connexions (22; 62) are arranged at the ends of the rams (2, 42) 
which are remote from the tools and project out of the frame (1, 41) guiding the rams 

(2, 42), and push-pull rods (22) or rotating rods (62) are provided as drive connexions 
with the displacement devices (19 to 22 [
sic
 - 
recte
 21], 59 to 61), mounted on the 

front plates (18, 58) of the rams, for the transverse displacement of the tools (3, 43). 
A forging machine according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 linear-stroke drives 
(23), push-pull rods (22) as drive connexions and angle-lever drives (19, 20, 21) as displacement 

devices are provided. 
A forging machine according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that
 piston-cylinder units 
(24a, 24b) with stroke stages are provided, wherein the stroke stages correspond in 

number and magnitude to stages of stops (26, 27, 28) for the stroke-end position limits 
of the rams (2) corresponding to the tool setting. 
A forging machine according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in that
 
flanges (14, 54) surrounding the open ends of the cylinders (4, 44b) and situated outside 

the guides of the rams (2, 42) and the cylinders (4, 44b) are used to secure the 
drives (23, 63).
