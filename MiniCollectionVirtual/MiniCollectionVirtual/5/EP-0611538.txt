<ABSTRACT>
A pad (6) is arranged on the upper and lower sides 
of a spring unit (1) to provide a laminate structure. 

The laminate structure is covered with an outer cover 
body (7) comprising top and bottom layers (8, 9) 

covering the corresponding pads and a side layer (11) 
covering the laminate structure. A joining member (13) 

of heat-shrinkable synthetic resin have one end width 
portion joined to the inner surfaces of the whole marginal 

edge portions of the top and bottom layers (8, 9). 
The other end width portion of the joining member cover 

the corresponding outer marginal edge portions of the 
pads (6). The joining member (13), upon being heat 

shrunk, have their other end width portion brought into 
firm engagement with the spring unit (1) so that the 

pads (6) and outer cover body (7) are firmly held relative 
to the spring unit (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a mattress apparatus
having a laminate structure of a pad-mounted spring
unit and an outer cover body covering the laminate
structure and a method for manufacturing the same.Generally,
see for instance US-A-4 463 466,
the mattress apparatus has a spring unit
comprised of rows of many coil springs to provide a
laminate structure with pads, such as synthetic cotton
and urethane foam, formed thereon. The laminate structure
is covered with an outer cover body. The outer
cover body comprises top and bottom layers covering the
corresponding pads and side layers covering an outer
peripheral area of the spring unit.In the mattress apparatus thus constructed, in
order to prevent the pads from being displaced relative
to the spring unit, the pads are joined to the spring
unit by a greater number of clips. Further, in order to
prevent the outer cover body from being displaced relative
to the spring unit, flange cloths are joined at one
end portion to the inner surfaces of the top and bottom
layers and at the other end portion to the marginal edge
area of the spring unit by clips as in the case of the
pads.According to the aforementioned arrangement the
pads are prevented, by the clips, from being displaced
and the outer cover body is prevented, by the flange
cloths, from being displaced. The clipping of the pads to the spring unit
requires lots of time, thus leading to lowered
production. Further the joining of the flange cloths to
the spring unit also takes lots of time on many
occasions.In the case where the mattress apparatus has to be
scrapped due to damage caused by the prolonged use of
it, it has recently been practiced that those component
parts are dismembered for the types of materials to be
sorted and for ready disposal. For this reason, it is
necessary to scrap the mattress apparatus, while grouping
their component parts into metal parts, such as the
spring unit, and pads (synthetic cotton, etc., for
instance) and outer cover body.If, however, the pads are joined by many clips to
the spring unit as in the aforementioned case, then it
is rather difficult to remove the pads from the spring
unit and also to remove the outer cover body from the
spring unit. Therefore, it takes lots of time to disassemble
the component parts for scrapping purpose.It is accordingly the object of the present invention
to provide a mattress apparatus capable of joining
pads and outer cover body to a spring unit without using
many clips and doing so without being displaced from the
spring unit
