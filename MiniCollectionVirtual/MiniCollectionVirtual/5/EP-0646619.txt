<ABSTRACT>
The aim was to develop a process for the production of approximately spherical polyolefin foam particles (beads) having a coarse cell structure and a narrow cell-size distribution with the aid of dispersion foaming. This object is achieved by a process in which the reactor contents, which essentially comprise polyolefin particles, a liquid dispersion medium and optionally a volatile blowing agent, are first treated at a first temperature above the crystallite melting point Tm of the polyolefin, and are subsequently passed through a cooling device in which the dispersion is brought to a second, lower temperature, after which the polymer particles are then foamed at this temperature. The foamed particles can be converted into mouldings by known methods.

A process for the production of polyolefin foam
particles by dispersion foaming, characterized in that the

reactor contents, which essentially comprise polyolefin
particles, a liquid dispersion medium and, if desired, a

volatile blowing agent, are first treated at a first
temperature above the crystallite melting point T
m
 of the
polyolefin, and subsequently passed through a cooling

system, in which the dispersion is brought to a second,
lower temperature which lies above the softening point of

the polyolefin, and the polymer particles are then foamed at
this temperature.
A process according to claim 1, characterized in
that the first temperature is in the range of from T
m
 + 1°C
to T
m
 + 20°C.
A process according to either one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the second, lower temperature

is from 5 to 25°C below the first temperature.
A process according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the cooling system through

which the reactor contents flow is a heat exchanger.
A process according to claim 4, characterized in
that the residence time of the dispersion in the heat

exchanger is from 1 to 100 seconds, preferably from 5 to 20
seconds.
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the cooling system through which the

reactor contents flow consists in that cold dispersion
medium or another cold, inert substance is metered into the

dispersion exit stream.
A process according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the cooling system through 

which the reactor contents flow is followed by a preferably
heat-insulated length of piping.
A process according to claim 7, characterized in
that the residence time of the dispersion in the downstream

length of piping is from 1 to 100 seconds, preferably from
5 to 20 seconds.
A process according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the polyolefin particles

comprise an ethylene-propylene random copolymer containing
from 1 to 15% by weight of ethylene.
