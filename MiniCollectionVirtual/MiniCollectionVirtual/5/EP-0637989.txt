<ABSTRACT>
Method and device for extracorporeal treatment of blood to effectively remove toxins therefrom and from patients are disclosed. The method includes the steps of passing the blood and dialysate through a plate dialyzer (30) comprising a blood inlet (39), a blood outlet (40) and a dialysate inlet (29), a dialysate outlet (35) and the blood side is separated from the dialysate side by dialyzer membranes. The method also includes passing a sorbent suspension through dialysate side and applying alternating negative pressure and positive pressure on the dialysate side of the dialyzer via an accumulateur (22) to expand and contract dialyzer membranes and agitate the sorbent suspension to prevent settling and mix it to maintain chemical gradients across the membrane. A positive pressure gradient is maintained throughout the cycle from the blood side to the dialysate side of the dialyzer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to devices
for extracorporeally treating blood to selectively remove
toxins therefrom.By way of background, extensive efforts have been made to
discover safe and effective methods for removing toxins from
patients by extracorporeal treatment of their blood. These
efforts have included many studies directed to methods for
extracorporeal treatment of hepatic failure due to infection,
cirrhosis, toxin damage or other causes. Many methods have
been proposed with the goal of removing small molecular
toxins, protein-bound molecules or larger molecules thought
to be responsible for the coma and illness of hepatic
failure. Thus far, evidence has been presented supporting
adverse effects caused by non-protein bound small molecules
such as ammonia, phenols, mercaptans, short chain fatty
acids, aromatic amino-acids, neural inhibitors (GABA,
glutamate), false neural transmitters (octopamine) and bile
salts. Protein-bound bilirubin and bacterial endotoxins are
large molecules which are toxic, but generally not thought to
be responsible for the coma and illness of hepatic failure.
Nevertheless, many hepatologists have tended to ignore the
small molecules and remove the large toxins by various
means.As to specific modes of treatment, those previously
proposed and used have included blood perfusion over
heterogeneous liver pieces or past membranes which contact
hepatocytes. Also proposed and used have been hemoperfusion
through columns of coated activated carbon or macroreticular
resins, blood exchange, plasmapheresis with plasma 
replacement, plasmapheresis with plasma perfusion through
bilirubin-binding and aromatic amino acid-binding sorbents,
standard hemodialysis, standard hemodialysis with an amino
acid dialysate and plasma exchange, high permeability
hemodialysis, dialysis with charcoal-impregnated membranes,
continuous hemofiltration, peritoneal dialysis, oral sorbents
and many other therapies.While some of these previously proposed treatments have
produced neurological improvement in stage 2 or 3 coma and
have aided hepatic regeneration after injury, they have not
provided much clinical improvement in patients in stage 4
coma on respirators. Additionally, these diverse treatments
each produce adverse effects on the patient, offsetting
benefits. See, generally, Ash, S.R., Treatment of Acute
Hepatic Failure With Encephalopathy: A Review, Int. J. of
Artif. Organs, Vol. 14, pp. 191-195 (1991).For example, although daily charcoal hemoperfusion has
been shown to provide neurologic

A dialysis instrument, comprising:

a plate dialyzer (30) having a blood inlet (39) to and a blood outlet (40) from a
blood side separated from a dialysate side by dialyzer membranes, said plate dialyzer

(30) further having a dialysate inlet (29) to and dialysate outlet (35) from said
dialysate side, said dialyzer membranes being compliantly formed to expand and

compress in response to alternating negative pressure and positive pressure on said
dialysate side of said dialyzer;
dialysate circulating means for circulating dialysate through said dialysate side
of said dialyzer in a direction generally from said dialysate inlet (29) to said dialysate

outlet (35);
said dialysate circulating means including an accumulator reservoir (22)
operable to alternately accumulate and expel dialysate to apply alternating negative

pressure and positive pressure on said dialysate side of said dialyzer and to thereby
cause said expansion and contraction of dialyzer membranes while maintaining a

positive pressure gradient from said blood side to said dialysate side of said dialzyer;
blood circulating means for circulating blood through said blood side of said
dialyzer in a direction generally from said blood inlet to said blood outlet and

powered by said expansion and contraction of dialyzer membranes caused by
alternating negative and positive pressure on said dialysate side of said dialyzer.
The dialysis instrument of claim 1 wherein said dialysate circulating means
includes a dialysate storage reservoir (15) coupled to the dialysate inlet (29); and

   wherein said accumulator reservoir (22) is located between said dialysate
outlet (35) and said dialysate storage reservoir (15).
The dialysis instrument of claim 2 wherein a one way valve (45) allowing
dialysate flow toward said dialysate storage reservoir (15) is located between said

accumulator reservoir (22) and said dialysate storage reservoir (15) so that dialysate
expelled from said accumulator reservoir (22) passes partially into said dialysate side

of said dialyzer and partially to said storage reservoir (15). 
The dialysis instrument of claim 3 wherein said accumulator reservoir (22)
comprises a container having a port (21) located above the maximum level to which

dialysate accumulates in said container, through which negative and positive pressure
can be alternately applied to cause said accumulation and expellation of dialysate into

and from said container.
The dialysis instrument of claim 4 and also including means for alternately
applying positive and negative pressure to said port.
The dialysis instrument of claim 5 which is adapted to cause counter-current
flow of said dialysate and said blood.
The dialysis instrument of claim 1 which includes:

a dialysate storage reservoir (15);
first conduit means (33) for fluidly connecting said dialysate reservoir (15) to
said dialysate inlet (29) of said dialyzer (30);
second conduit means (34) for fluidly connecting said dialysate storage

reservoir (15) to said dialysate outlet (35) of said dialyzer (30);
a one-way valve (45) in said second conduit means (34) which allows flow
only toward said dialysate reservoir (15);
and wherein said accumulator reservoir (22) is fluidly connected to said
second conduit means (34) between said one-way valve (45) and said dialysate outlet

(35) of said dialyzer so that dialysate expelled from said accumulator reservoir (22)
passes partially back into said dialysate side of said dialyzer and partially to said

dialysate storage reservoir (15).
The dialysis instrument of claim 7 wherein said dialysate storage reservoir
(15) contains dry materials to which water can be added to create a dialysate sorbent

suspension.
