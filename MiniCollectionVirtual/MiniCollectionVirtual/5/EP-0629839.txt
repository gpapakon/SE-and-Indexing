<ABSTRACT>
A vibrating gyroscope is mounted on a cutting device. 
The vibrating gyroscope is heated by halogen lamps, and a 

drift due to temperature variation is measured by a drift 
measuring device. Resonance frequencies in plural 

directions of the vibrating gyroscope are measured by a 
frequency measuring device. A cutting quantity of a 

vibrating body of the vibrating gyroscope is calculated from 
the drift due to a temperature variation and a difference 

of plural resonance frequencies by a control device. The 
cutting quantity of the vibrating body is decided by 

deliberating the cutting quantity obtained experientially. 
When the cutting quantity of the vibrating body is decided, 

rotating bar files are pressed against the vibrating body 
responsive thereto, thereby the vibrating body is cut.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an adjusting apparatus 
of a vibrating gyroscope, and more particularly to an 
adjusting apparatus of the vibrating gyroscope for obtaining 
the gyroscope having a good characteristics. Fig. 3 is a perspective view showing an example of a 
vibrating gyroscope, and Fig. 4 is a sectional view thereof. 
The vibrating gyroscope 10 includes, for example, a regular 
triangular prism shaped vibrating body 12. The vibrating 
body 12 is formed, generally, by a material which generates 
mechanical vibration, such as elinver, iron-nickel alloy, 
quartz, glass, crystal, ceramics and the like. At center portions on three side faces of the vibrating 
body 12, piezoelectric elements 14a, 14b and 14c are formed. 
The piezoelectric element 14a includes a piezoelectric layer 
16a consisting of, for example, a piezoelectric ceramic. On 
both faces of the piezoelectric layer 16a, electrodes 18a 
and 20a are formed. One electrode 20a is bonded to the side  
 
face of the vibrating body 12. Similarly, the piezoelectric 
elements 14b, 14c include piezoelectric layers 16b, 16c, on 
the both faces of which electrodes 18b, 20b and electrodes 
18c, 20c are formed. The electrodes 20b, 20c of the 
piezoelectric elements 14b, 14c are bonded to the side faces 
of the vibrating body 12. Supporting members 22a and 22b are fixed to a ridge 
line near two nodal points of the vibrating body 12. The 
supporting members 22a and 22b are formed by bending metal 
wires into a U shape. Center portions of the supporting 
members 22a and 22b are welded to the ridge line of the 
vibrating body 12. End portions of the supporting members 
22a and 22b are secured to a supporting plate 24. In such vibrating gyroscope 10, when designating the 
ridge line between the piezoelectric elements 14a and 14b is 
taken as C, the ridge line between the piezoelectric 
elements 14a and 14c as L, and the ridge line between the 
piezoelectric elements 14b and 14c as R, the piezoelectric 
elements 14a, 14b on both sides of the ridge line C are used 
for detection and drive, and the piezoelectric element 14c 
is used for feedback. When using the vibrating gyroscope 
10, a oscillation circuit is connected between the 
piezoelectric elements 14a, 14b for drive and the 
piezoelectric element 14c for feedback, and a drive signal 
is applied to the vibrating gyroscope 10 from the  
 
oscillation circuit. The vibrating body 12 bends and 
vibrates in a direction perpendicular to the face of the 
piezoelectric element 14c by the driving
