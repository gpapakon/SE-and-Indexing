<ABSTRACT>
For making an electrically heatable laminated glass pane, on the thermoplastic film (1) bonding the individual glass panes to each other heating wires are laid down and fixed on the film (1) continuously from one film edge (6) to the opposite film edge. The heating wires (4) are connected in parallel connection to busbars (3), which are arranged at a distance (A) from the edge (6) of the film (1). Directly next to the busbars (3), the sections of the wires (4) lying between the busbars (3) and the edge (6) of the film are severed by bringing into contact with the wires (4) two electrodes (8, 9) connected to a power source. The electric power causes the wires (4) to be heated to their melting temperature and interrupted between the electrodes (8, 9).

Method for the manufacture of a laminated glass plate from at least two
single glass plates and at least one thermoplastic film connecting them

together and with one or more metal wires, the metal wires being placed and
fixed on the thermoplastic film and the film provided with the wires is

joined to the single glass plates accompanied by the application of heat and
pressure, characterized in that following the fixing of the wires placed over

and beyond at least one edge of the thermoplastic film and cut off outside
the film surface at least part of the wires is additionally locally completely

removed within the film surface by local application of energy
absorbed solely by the metal of the wires and heating the latter without

impairing the film, so that during the following joining process the thermoplastic
film at the separation points fills the entire space between the two

glass plates.
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that the energy necessary
for the local removal of the metal wires is supplied in the form of electrical

energy, in that an electrical potential difference is applied on
either side of the point of the wires to be separated.
Method according to claim 2, characterized in that two electrodes connected
to a power supply are guided along a separating line over the wires to

be separated.
Method according to claim 3, characterized in that as electrodes are
guided along the separating line over the wires to be separated two conductive,

circular, rotatably mounted disks electrically isolated by a mutual
spacing.
Use of an electric circuit for producing the electrical separating energy

for performing the method according to one of the claims 2 to 4, characterized
by a direct current source (18), a current limiting circuit (19) and a

capacitor (20) serving as an energy storage device.
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that the energy necessary
for the local removal of the metal wires is supplied in the form of laser

radiation of a lower wavelength than 2.5 micrometers. 
Method according to claim 6, characterized in that when using a pulsed
laser, the laser movement speed is so selected as a function of the pulse

frequency that the cut surfaces of the areas irradiated by the single pulses
overlap.
Method according to claim 6 or 7, characterized in that on separating the
metal wires along busbars comprising tin-coated metal foil strips, the laser

radiation is partly guided over the busbars in such a way that simultaneously
by melting tin contact is improved between the metal foil strips and the

wires.
Method according to one or more of the claims 1 to 5, characterized in
that simultaneously with the separating process or directly following onto

the latter, by contacting the wires on either side of the wire separating
point and a check circuit, the electrical resistance is checked.
Method according to claim 9, characterized in that the electrical resistance
is directly checked by means of the electrodes bringing about the

separating process.
Method according to claim 9 or 10, characterized in that on dropping
below a predetermined resistance value the wire is marked as unseparated at

the point to be separated.
Method according to claim 9, 10 or 11, characterized in that on dropping
below a predetermined resistance value at the point to be separated an

optical or acoustic signal is emitted.
Method according to one or more of the claims 9 to 12, characterized in
that on dropping below a predetermined resistance value, the signal obtained

is stored by a counter.
Use of an electronic circuit having a resistor (13) connected in parallel
to contact electrodes (11, 12) and an operational amplifier (34) with two

inputs (42, 43), in which one input (42) of the operational amplifier (34) is 
controlled by the electrodes (11, 12) by means of a blocking capacitor (31)

and the other input (43) by the output signal of the operational amplifier
(34) by means of a capacitor (37) and a resistor (36), and that the output

signal of the operational amplifier (34) is used for controlling a storing or
marking device (38), for performing the method according to one of the claims

9 to 13.
