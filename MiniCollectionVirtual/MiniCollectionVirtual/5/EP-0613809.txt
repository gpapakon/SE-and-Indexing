<ABSTRACT>
In contrast with standard goods wagons, in high-speed transport special devices are provided for achieving the required quiet running and the necessary braking. According to the prior art, inter alia a bolster with pendulum links or chain links and transverse dampers is provided for the laterally decoupled articulation of the bogie. The use of the flexicoil effect of helical springs is not possible since the existing large differences in loading do not correspond to the helical springs due to the existing transverse suspension properties.   According to the invention, an axle guide, suspension and damping element (16) with approximately 1/10 of the acceptable static spring compression acts between the empty and loaded goods wagon. This element has a sufficient longitudinal elasticity and a transverse elasticity which is several times larger for good horizontal running of the vehicle. For stabilisation, dampers which are matched proportionally are integrated for the degrees of elasticity acting in all three directions. For compensation of the wheel contact forces, a distortable bogie frame (1) is provided.

High-speed bogie for railway wagons, having axle 
box housings, a twistable H-shaped frame, a bolster which 

is coupled thereto in a Z-shaped and virtually longitudinally 
rigid manner and has a lateral support and 

adjustable pendulums, combined guiding and suspension 
elements being arranged between the bogie frame and the 

upper part of the axle box housing and also the lower 
part of the axle box housing, the vertical suspension of 

which elements is progressive, the longitudinal spring 
rate being considerably greater than the lateral spring 

rate, characterized in that a friction lamella (26) is 
arranged between an upper part (19) of the axle box 

housing and a rubber compression spring (24) arranged 
vertically centrally above it, which friction lamella has 

an annular friction surface and is mounted at the end on 
a bolt (27), and in that, furthermore, a plurality of 

rubber thrust and compression springs (28) are situated, 
with partial interposition of a pressing wedge (29), on 

both sides of the upper part (19) of the axle box housing 
and a lower part (20) of the axle box housing, between 

which springs are arranged vertical friction lamellae 
(30) which have an annular support and are mounted at the 

end on a bolt (27), not all the rubber thrust and compression 
springs (28) being in operative connection with 

the vertical friction lamellae (30). 
High-speed bogie for railway wagons according to 
Claim 1, characterized in that a helical spring (10) has 

a progressively acting rubber auxiliary spring (11) in 
its centre, which auxiliary spring is operative only in 

the working range between the empty and the laden state,  
 

and in that the transverse distance between the helical 
springs (10) is greater than or equal to the transverse 

distance between the guiding, suspension and damping 
element (16) of the wheelsets (17), and in that the 

adjustable pendulums (13) are designed so as to be 
vertical or inclined outwards at the bottom. 
High-speed bogie for railway wagons according to 
Claims 1 and 2, characterized in that the central rubber 

compression spring (24) has a supporting bell (25) or a 
belt ring (25'), a spacing which increases from the 

common connection point of the rubber compression spring 
(24) and the supporting bell (25) towards the edge of the 

bell or the edge of the belt ring being provided between 
the rubber compression spring (24) and the supporting 

bell (25), and the supporting bell (25) or the belt ring 
(25') simultaneously serving as a vertical emergency 

stop, and in that, furthermore, the spring excursion in 
the longitudinal and transverse directions is limited by 

the housing cover (22) and the housing base (23) interacting 
with the stepped stops (33) and forms the horizontal 

emergency guide.
