<ABSTRACT>
A stent comprising a coil including a plurality of arcuate sections (40, 42, 50, 52) that alternate directions around a central axis (38) each arcuate section including a pair of curved turns joined by a cusp (48, 58) and the cusps of adjacent arcuate sections intermeshing and defining at least one region of overlap, which in turn describes a helix around and along the length of the coil. In the preferred embodiment, there are two regions of overlap, which together describe a double helix. In another preferred embodiment, the stent is bifurcated so as to support a branched vessel or the like. A method for forming a stent, including the steps of providing a flat sheet of material, chemically etching said sheet to form a blank, and forming said blank into a cylindrical coil, is also disclosed. The coiling step is preferably carried out on a plurality of rollers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to supports for collapsed or occluded blood vessels, and
more particularly, to a coiled wire stent for insertion and expansion in a collapsed or
occluded blood vessel. Still more particularly, the present invention relates to a coiled, stent
which may be bifurcated to support a Y-shaped juncture of two blood vessels.The present invention further relates to methods for manufacturing artificial supports
for blood vessels and more particularly, to methods for making a wire coil having certain
desired properties. Still more particularly, the present invention concerns methods for
preparing a continuous loop and forming the loop into a cylindrical shape having a desired
configuration.A typical wire stent for insertion and expansion in a collapsed or occluded blood
vessel is shown in US Patent 4,800,882 and includes a coiled wire having a plurality of
curved sections that are formed into a generally circular configuration. Adjacent curved
sections are joined by a bend so that a series of alternating opposing loops are formed. The
stent has a cylindrical shape with a longitudinal opening through which a folded balloon
catheter is inserted. The opposing loops are tightly contracted about the catheter so that the
cylindrical shape has an overlapping region in which portions of adjacent loops
circumferentially overlap. The loops are arranged so that when the balloon catheter is
inflated, adjacent loops diverge circumferentially relative to each other, thereby decreasing
the width of the overlapping region while increasing the diameter of the cylindrical shape.
As the diameter of the cylindrical stent increases, the stent engages the inner surface of the
blood vessel.In operation, the stent is deployed at its desired position within the vessel in its
collapsed state, by threading the balloon catheter up the vessel from an incision some
distance away, and then expanded to its expanded state, for supportive engagement with the
interior of the vessel wall.The prior art stents have several deficiencies. As shown in Figure 7 of US Patent
4,800,882, the alternating bends are aligned in relation to the longitudinal axis of the stent
such that upon expansion of the stent as shown in Figure 8, the opposing loops may be
expanded such that a longitudinal gap appears between the opposing bends of the loops,
leaving a longitudinal unsupported area along the occluded blood vessel. Such an
unsupported area is undesirable. Such undesirable unsupported areas are also provided, to
some extent, by a
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A stent (10) for supporting a blood vessel, comprising:

a single length of material bent to form a coil (22) about a longitudinal axis (38),
said coil defining a helix around said longitudinal axis; and
said coil being such that said material does not cross itself at any point, characterised
in that
said length of material comprises a closed loop.
A stent (10) according to claim 1, wherein said coil comprises a plurality of
clockwise and counterclockwise arcuate sections (40,42;50,52) each having an adjacent cusp

(48,58) at which the material reverses directions, said material not crossing itself at any
point.
A stent (10) according to claim 2, wherein said cusps (48,58) of said clockwise and
counterclockwise arcuate sections (40,42;50,52) overlap to form at least one region of

overlap.
A stent (10) according to claim 3, wherein the region of overlap extends helically
about the longitudinal axis (38).
A stent according to any of claims 1 to 4, wherein the continuous loop forms a
bifurcated stent (81) for supporting a bifurcated vessel without obstructing fluid flow

therethrough.
A stent (81) according to claim 5, further comprising:

a major coil (83); and
a pair of minor coils (85,87) affixed to and integral with one end of the major coil.
A method for forming a closed loop stent (10)
according to claim 1, comprising the

steps of:

providing a sheet of material from which the stent is to be formed;
cutting a closed loop (150) from said sheet;
rolling said closed loop obliquely between a series of rollers (201-204) so as to
form said closed loop into a cylindrical stent; and
removing said cylindrical stent from said rollers.
A method according to claim 7, wherein the step of cutting the closed loop comprises
photo etching said sheet.
