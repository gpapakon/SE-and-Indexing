<ABSTRACT>
A biological process for predominantly producing an 
optically active α-hydroxycarboxylic acid having a phenyl 

group directly from a racemic α-hydroxynitrile or a mixture 
of an aldehyde corresponding to the nitrile and prussic acid 

as a substrate is disclosed, comprising reacting a microorganism 
belonging to the genus 
Rhodococcus
, 
Alcaligenes
, 

Brevibacterium
 or 
Pseudomonas
 with the substrate in a neutral 
to basic aqueous medium. A desired optically active α-hydroxycarboxylic 

acid having a phenyl group can be obtained 
quantitatively at a high optical purity.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a biological process for
producing an optically active α-hydroxycarboxylic acid having
a phenyl group. More particularly, it relates to a process
for producing an optically active α-hydroxycarboxylic acid
having a phenyl group as represented by formula (I) shown
below, by the action of a microorganism capable of
asymmetrically hydrolyzing a nitrile group of a racemic α-hydroxynitrile
represented by formula (II) shown below. The
optically active α-hydroxycarboxylic acid of formula (I) is
of industrial importance as a starting material for
synthesizing pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, such as
antibiotics, drugs acting on the sympathetic nervous system,
anti-diabetic agents, and as a resolving reagent.Known processes for producing an optically active α-hydroxycarboxylic
acid having a phenyl group include optical
resolution of racemates by crystallization or chromatography
and asymmetric synthesis through organochemical procedures.
These processes generally involve complicated operations yet
give only a low yield of a product.To overcome these problems, biological processes
utilizing microorganisms have been proposed. For example, it
has been proposed to asymmetrically hydrolyze substituted or 
unsubstituted mandelonitrile or substituted or unsubstituted
mandelamide by the action of a microorganism belonging to the
genus Alcaligenes, Pseudomonas, Rhodopseudomonas,
Corynebacterium, Acinetobacter, Bacillus, Mycobacterium,
Rhodococcus or Candida to obtain optically active mandelic
acid or a derivative thereof, as disclosed in European Patent
Publication No. 0 384 901 A (corresponding to JP-A-2-84198
(the term "JP-A" as used herein means an "unexamined
published Japanese patent application")) and Applied and
Environmental Microbiology, Vol. 57, pp. 3028-3032 (1991).
It is also known to obtain a predominant proportion of R(-)-mandelic
acid or a derivative thereof directly from racemic
mandelonitrile or a derivative thereof by the action of a
microorganism belonging to the genus Pseudomonas,
Alcaligenes, Acinetobacter, Caseobacter, Nocardia, Bacillus,
Brevibacterium or Aureobacterium as disclosed in U.S. Patent
5,223,416 (corresponding to JP-A-4-218385, JP-A-4-99495 and
JP-A-4-99496).However, the above publications do not disclose
producing an optically active α-hydroxycarboxylic acid having
a phenyl group represented by formula (I) nor what activity
the above microorganisms have relating to producing an
optically active α-hydroxycarboxylic acid having a phenyl
group represented by
