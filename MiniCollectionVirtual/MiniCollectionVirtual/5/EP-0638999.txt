<ABSTRACT>
When a zinc oxide piezoelectric crystal film is 
epitaxially grown on an R-plane sapphire substrate by 

sputtering, a target containing not more than 4.5 percent 
by weight of Cu with respect to the total content of Zn 

and Cu is employed so that the zinc oxide piezoelectric 
film contains Cu. Thus, it is possible to obtain a zinc 

oxide piezoelectric crystal film having excellent 
orientation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a zinc oxide
piezoelectric crystal film provided on a sapphire plane,
which is employed for propagating surface acoustic waves
in a surface acoustic wave device.A typical surface acoustic wave (SAW) substrate for a
SAW device is prepared by providing a piezoelectric
crystal film on a non-piezoelectric substrate. In such a
SAW substrate, a transducer which is formed by an
interdigital electrode is provided on an outer surface of
the piezoelectric crystal film or an interface between the
piezoelectric crystal film and the non-piezoelectric
substrate, in order to excite surface acoustic waves.In relation to the aforementioned SAW substrate,
known (see for example US-A 4 501 987) is a SAW substrate which is formed by a non-piezoelectric
substrate of sapphire (α-Al2O3) and a
piezoelectric crystal film of zinc oxide (ZnO). In
relation to such a zinc oxide/sapphire SAW substrate,
further, (0112)-plane cut sapphire (hereinafter referred
to as "R-plane sapphire") is employed so that (1120)-plane 
zinc oxide (hereinafter referred to as "Q-plane ZnO") is
epitaxially grown on its R-plane.Fig. 1 shows a SAW substrate 3 which is obtained by
growing a Q-plane ZnO epitaxial film 2 on an R-plane
sapphire substrate 1, as described above. In relation to
such a SAW substrate 3, it is known that the SAW substrate
3 provides a high sound velocity and high coupling when
the R-plane of the sapphire substrate 1 and the Q-plane of
the ZnO epitaxial film 2 are parallel to each other and
the [0001] direction (C-axis direction) of the ZnO
epitaxial film 2 and the [0111] direction (D-axis
direction) of the sapphire substrate 1 are in parallel
with each other as shown by arrows in Fig. 1.In order to form the ZnO epitaxial film 2 on the
sapphire substrate 1, chemical transportation, CVD or
sputtering is employed in general, while sputtering is
widely employed among such processes, in particular.When a pure ZnO thin film is formed on an R-plane
sapphire substrate by sputtering, for example, its
orientation is still insufficient for putting a SAW
substrate which is formed by such a ZnO thin film into
practice, although the C-axis of ZnO is parallel to the
surface of the sapphire substrate to some extent and a
certain degree of orientation is attained on the Q-plane
of ZnO. As the result, characteristics of the 
interdigital transducer such as an electromechanical
coupling factor are inferior to predetermined values in a
SAW device employing such a SAW substrate.Accordingly, an object of the present
