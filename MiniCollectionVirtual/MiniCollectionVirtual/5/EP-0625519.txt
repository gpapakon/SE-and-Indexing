<ABSTRACT>
A process for the production of an alkylene carbonate at 
high yields and high selectivity by a reaction between an 

alkylene glycol and urea, wherein ammonia-containing steam 
exhausted from the reaction portion is downwardly introduced 

into a cooling member through a gas washing member, condensate 
and ammonia gas exhausted from a bottom of the cooling member 

are gas-liquid separated, at least a portion of the condensate 
is introduced into the gas washing member, and the ammonia gas 

is removed from the reaction system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for the 
production of alkylene carbonate. Alkylene carbonate is 
important as an organic solvent, a processing agent for 
synthetic fibers, a raw material for a pharmaceutical 
composition or an intermediate for the synthesis of a 
dialkyl carbonate. Various methods are known for producing alkylene 
carbonate, while a method in which alkylene glycol and urea 
are allowed to react attracts attention. That is because 
the raw materials are available at relatively low costs and 
alkylene carbonate can be facilely produced. EP0443758A 
discloses a method in which alkylene glycol and urea are 
allowed to react under atmospheric pressure or elevated 
pressure in the absence of a catalyst or in the presence of 
a tin catalyst. The reaction for producing alkylene carbonate from 
alkylene glycol and urea is represented by the following 
reaction scheme. 
   The above reaction is generally carried out by a 
method in which alkylene glycol is used in a greater molar 
ratio than that of urea, a reflux condenser is provided on 
the top of a reactor, and ammonia gas generated as a 
byproduct as the reaction proceeds is separated from the 
reaction system.  
 When the above reaction is carried out by the use 
of a reaction apparatus described above, however, a white 
crystal is deposited on the reflux condenser as the reaction 
proceeds, and the yield of alkylene carbonate calculated on 
the basis of urea decreases. When the above reaction is 
carried out by a batch mehtod, the reflux condenser is 
rarely clogged since the period of time required for the 
reaction is not so long. In the continuous reaction, 
however, the amount of deposited crystal increases along 
with the operation of the apparatus, and the reflux 
condenser is finally clogged. As a method for overcoming the above clogging 
phenomenon to proceed with the reaction smoothly, at least 
two series of reflux condensers may be provided so that 
these reflux condensers are switched as required. However, 
the switching operation is complicated, the apparatus 
requires an additional cost, and the above method cannot 
finally resolve the decrease in the yield of alkylene 
carbonate. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide a method for the production of alkylene carbonate 
from urea and alkylene glycol, in which the operation is 
facile, the yield is high and the selectivity to the 
alkylene carbonate is high. It is another object of the present invention to 
provide a method for the production of
