<ABSTRACT>
A sheet dispenser or sheet dispenser subassembly 
including a coherent stack of tape flags or other 

adhesive-bearing sheets that can be unobtrusively 
permanently or removably adhered on a page of a book, 

catalog, brochure, etc., because it has a supple cover 
layer that is a thin, tear-resistant polymeric film. 

The dispenser subassembly has a pressure-sensitive 
adhesive layer on a peripheral portion of the cover 

layer by which it can be adhered to the page which then 
serves as a back layer for the dispenser, whereas the 

dispenser includes a bottom layer on an outer surface 
of which is a layer of pressure-sensitive adhesive 

layer by which the dispenser can be adhered to a 
surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to dispensers for sheets
from a coherent stack of sheets, each sheet bearing a
band of pressure-sensitive adhesive, such as a
repositionable pressure-sensitive adhesive, by which it
can be self-adhered to a variety of surfaces. The
invention is particularly related to such dispensers
which have a low profiles so that they can be adhered
to an inside page of a magazine, catalog, notebook, or
the like without creating an unsightly bulge.Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company or 3M
(the company to which this application is assigned)
markets a Post-itTM brand repositionable tape flag that
can be self-adhered to an object, e.g., to mark a page
of a book to draw attention to that page or to specific
information on that page. Typical is the tape flag
(10) of Figure 1 of co-assigned U.S. Pat. No. 4,907,825
(Miles et al.) which has an elongate layer (11) of
flexible polymeric material having a wide band (16) of
repositionable pressure-sensitive adhesive covering one
major surface of one end (the second end portion 15) of
the polymeric material while being free of adhesive on
both major surfaces of the other end (the first end
portion 19). The first end portion preferably is
brightly colored to attract attention while the second
end portion is transparent so that it does not obscure
a substrate to which it is applied.A dispenser for a coherent stack of tape flags
(10) is shown in Figures 3-7 of the Miles et al.
patent. In the stack, the first and second end
portions of successive tape flags are reversed so that
the adhesive of each tape flag adheres to the brightly 
colored second end portion of the underlying tape flag,
except that the lowermost tape flag is adhered to an
adhesive-free bottom sheet (33). The bottom sheet, in
combination with the low-friction nature of the bottom
wall (37) of the dispenser, permits the stack to
shuttle back or forth in an elongated closed chamber
(38) while successive uppermost tape flags are pulled
through a central transverse slot (42).The dispenser of Figures 3 through 7 of the Miles
et al patent can be called a "pop-up" dispenser,
because upon pulling successive uppermost tape flags
through the central transverse slot, an end portion of
the next tape flag pops up through the slot.The Miles et al patent shows in Figure 9 a
repositionable tape flag (80) which differs from that
of Figure 1 in that its band of repositionable
pressure-sensitive adhesive (86) covers one entire
surface of the polymeric material (81), and release
material covers the opposite
