<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a charge forming device of the venturi-type
for gas fuelled engines, comprising
the features of the
preamble portion of claim 1. Further the invention relates to a method
comprising the features of the preamble of claim 7.
One kind of charge forming device for gas fuelled engines uses a variable venturi-type
mixer in the juncture area of the air intake passage and the gaseous fuel passage, and also
connects a bleed air passage to the aforementioned gaseous fuel passage. The bleed air
passage employs a bleed air control valve to control its cross-sectional area. In such a
device, a feedback control based upon the oxygen concentration in the exhaust gases is used
to maintain λ = 1. The "λ" referenced above is defined as the actual air/fuel ratio divided
by the theoretical air/fuel ratio. Accordingly, in a stoichiometric state, λ can normally be
kept equal to 1 no matter what the fuel type or composition.The problem with the above described charge forming device is that feedback control
cannot be performed, for example, from the time when the engine is cold-started until the
time when the O2 sensor becomes active. Moreover, since the aforementioned O2 sensor
normally issues a detection signal only when the air/fuel supply goes rich, when the running operation
of the engine is in a lean air/fuel ratio state during fast idle, it is difficult to determine whether the lack of output from the
O2 sensor is because it has not yet active, or because the air/fuel mixture is lean. The
present applicant has previously made a proposal for using a specialized valve to determine
whether the O2 sensor is active, in which proposal the specialized valve periodically supplies
a rich air/fuel mixture during the above described lean running operation, which renders the 
above mentioned λ value greater than 1 in order to determine whether the O2 sensor is
active.However, the device to implement the aforementioned proposal would require a
specialized valve, that would increase the number of parts and thus make the structure more
complex and increase costs.A charge forming device and a method as mentioned above are known from
EP-A2-0 510 585 which relates to a gas engine. This reference teaches air bleed valves
and an oxygen sensor as parts of a feedback control system for controlling the
composition of air/fuel mixture which is supplied to the engine.The object of the present invention is to provide a charge forming device for gas fuelled
engines which is simple in structure and which moreover is able
