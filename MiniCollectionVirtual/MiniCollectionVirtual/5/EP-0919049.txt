<ABSTRACT>
This invention concerns a resonant circuit (6) for the electronic element. The task of the invention is to propose a resonant circuit (6) which can be reliably deactivated. This task is achieved by using a resonant circuit (6) consisting of two spiral printed circuits (2, 3) and one dielectric layer (4), wherein both spiral printed circuits (2, 3) are wrapped in opposing directions and arranged on both sides of the dielectric layer (4) so that they at least partly overlap. At least one selected area (8) is provided in which a conductive path arises between the two spiral printed circuits (2, 3) whenever a sufficiently high energy is applied by means of an external alternating field.

A resonant circuit (6) for electronic article
surveillance, comprising two coiled conductive tracks

(coils 2, 3) and one dielectric layer (4), wherein said
two coiled conductive tracks (2, 3) are wound in opposite

directions and are disposed on either side of the dielectric
layer (4) such as to overlap at least in part, and

wherein at least one selected area is provided in which a
conductive path is produced between the two coiled conductive

tracks (2, 3) as soon as energy in sufficiently
high amount is applied by an external alternating field.
The resonant circuit as claimed in claim 1,

wherein the dielectric layer (4) is of substantially uniform
thickness and has no additional manufacturing

defects (air inclusions 7, for example).
The resonant circuit as claimed in claim 1 and
2,

wherein the selected area is at the outer end areas of
the coils (2, 3) where the induced voltage of the coils

(2, 3), i.e., conductive tracks, is at its highest level.
The resonant circuit as claimed in claim 1,

wherein the selected area (8) is at any desired point on
the overlapping coils (2, 3) and is treated such that the

conductive path is built up in the selected area (9) when
the deactivation signal is applied. 
The resonant circuit as claimed in claim 4,

wherein the dielectric layer (4) is thinner in the selected
area than it is in the remaining areas, or the

selected area (8) is a hole in the dielectric layer (4).
The resonant circuit as claimed in claim 4,

wherein the dielectric layer (4) has a different physical
or chemical property in the selected area.
The resonant circuit as claimed in claim 1 or
2,

wherein the dielectric layer (4) is comprised of at least
two components (4a, 4b).
The resonant circuit as claimed in claim 1 or
7,

wherein the melting point of the one component (4a; 4b)
lies above the production temperature for the resonant

circuits (6).
The resonant circuit as claimed in claim 7 or
8,

wherein the components (4a, 4b) are of a nature enabling
them to be joined together by either a coating or a laminating

process.
The security element as claimed in claim 2,

wherein the areas of overlap between the two coiled conductive
tracks (2, 3), and hence the capacitance between

the coiled conductive tracks (2, 3), are concentrated at
the inner ends of the coiled conductive tracks (2, 3). 
The resonant circuit as claimed in claim 10,

wherein the outer ends of the two coiled conductive
tracks (2, 3) overlap in a small area and a relatively

long length of track with no overlap is adjacent to the
outer ends of the conductive tracks (2, 3).
