<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to the field of
thermostats and more particularly relates to thermostats
having the ability to communicate externally.Thermostats are well known devices for controlling
temperature within a selected space or grouping
of spaces. Microprocessor based thermostats are
now widely available as reliable devices for achieving
temperature control.U.S. Patent No. 4,921,163 and UK patent application
no. GB 2,212,949A both show two processor
computer control systems which could be used for
HVAC controls, but both approach the problem in a
larger way and are not concerned with tying into total
home control systems.Typically, an operator could enter a series of
times and temperatures for controlling selected
space or grouping of spaces through a particular temperature
according to the schedule desired by the operator.
Thereafter, the thermostat would automatically
control the space or grouping of spaces temperature
according to the schedule entered by the operator.One problem associated with this kind of a thermostat
was that the operator had to be physically located
at the thermostat in order to make changes to
the time or temperature data. If for example it was desired
to change the temperature in the middle of the
night, it was inconvenient to get out of bed and go to
the thermostat to change the temperature.Another problem was that as advancements
were made to thermostat technology, old thermostats
became obsolete. It would be beneficial if microprocessor
based thermostats could be modified without
a complet changeout of thermostat equipment.The present invention is a communicating thermostat
unit which has two microprocessors. The first microprocessor
is connected to the temperature sensor
a data entry means and a display and basically operates
as an interface between an operator and the
thermostat. A second microprocessor is connected to
the HVAC system to be controlled and to a network
bus through a bus transceiver. The second microprocessor
does the actual control HVAC system through so
use of energy management programming and time
and temperature scheduling. The bus transceiver is
connectable to a network bus so that the thermostat
unit is capable of receiving instructions from an external
controller also connected to the network bus. The
external controller is capable of changing the time
and temperature data stored in the thermostat unit.In one preferred embodiment, one microprocessor 
is located in a subbase of the thermostat unit while another
microprocessor is located
