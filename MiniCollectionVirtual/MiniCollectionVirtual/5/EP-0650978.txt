<ABSTRACT>
Free-radical-crosslinkable copolymers having a number average molecular weight of from 1500 to 6000 and a molecular weight distribution corresponding to a polydispersity of from 1 to 4.0, obtainable by polymer-analogous reaction of     A) a copolymer (A) comprising   a1) from 50 to 85 mol % of a monomer (a1) containing the methacrylic acid structural unit and a2) from 15 to 50 mol % of another free-radical-polymerising monomer (a2), where a3) from 5 to 50 mol % of the total amount of the monomers (a1) and (a2) are monomers (a3) carrying functional groups which are capable of a condensation or addition reaction, obtainable by a free-radical bulk or solution polymerisation at from 140 to 210 DEG C and a mean residence time of from 2 to 90 min, with B) an olefinically unsaturated monomer (B) carrying a functional group which is complementary to that of the monomers (a3).   The free-radical-crosslinkable copolymers are used as binders for powder coatings (paints).

<CLAIMS>
A process for the preparation of powders for
coatings which are cured by UV radiation, from

copolymers capable of free radical crosslinking and
having a number average molecular weight of from 1 500

to 6 000 and a molecular weight distribution
corresponding to a polydispersity of from 1 to 4.0,

wherein

A) a copolymer (A) which is composed of

a1) from 50 to 85 mol% of a monomer (a1) having
the structural element of methacrylic acid

and
a2) from 15 to 50 mol% of another monomer (a2)
undergoing free radical polymerization,
a3) from 5 to 50 mol% of the total amount of the
monomers (a1) and (a2) being monomers (a3)

which carry functional groups and their
functional groups are capable of condensation

or addition reaction,

is prepared by free radical mass or solution
polymerization at from 140 to 210Â°C and during an

average residence time of from 2 to 90 minutes and is
subjected to a polymer-analogous reaction

with
B) an olefinically unsaturated monomer (B) which
carries a functional group which is complementary

to that of the monomers (a3).
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
copolymer is composed of


from 60 to 70 mol% of the monomers (a1)
from 15 to 25 mol% of the monomers (a2)
from 15 to 25 mol% of the monomers (a3).
