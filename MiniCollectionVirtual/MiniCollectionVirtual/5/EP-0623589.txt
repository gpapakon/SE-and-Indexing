<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a reagent and method for coupling amines
with carboxylic acids to form amides.Reacting an amine with a carboxylic acid to form a new species having an
amide linkage is well known to the chemical arts. The reaction is generally
implemented with a dehydrative coupling reagent.Within the last thirty years solid phase synthetic procedures for coupling amines
and carboxylic acids, for example to make peptides and polypeptides, have become
well known in the chemical arts. The Merrifield solid phase synthesis, in both manual
(JACS, 85, 2149, 1963) and automated (Science,150, 178, 1965) forms is perhaps the
oldest and best known method and functions by growing a polypeptide chain which is
bound on an insoluble polymer. The chain is grown amino acid by amino add, with
each new residue being added, in the presence of a coupling reagent, from a solution
of the N-blocked acid. By attaching the growing peptide chain to an insoluble polymer,
the Merrifield synthesis advantageously provides the peptide in a convenient form to
be filtered and washed free of reagents and by-products.In general, carbodiimides are known to be coupling reagents for the formation
of amide linkages. In some instances a carbodiimide coupling reagent has been
incorporated into a polymer, in what is in effect a variation on the Merrifield technique,
to form a solid phase coupling reagent. For example, Wolman et. al., Chem. Commun.,
629, (1967) report the use of an insoluble polycarbodiimide as a condensing agent in
peptide synthesis, with best results reportedly obtained using polyhexamethylene-carbodiimide
made by the catalytic decarboxylation of 1,6-diisocyanate hexane. This
solid phase coupling reagent thus incorporates carbodiimide linkages as part of the
polymer backbone.Weinshenker et. al., Tetrahedron Lett., 3281 (1972) and Org. Synth., Coll. Vol.
VII, 951, (1990) report synthesizing a polymeric carbodiimide by a detailed procedure
involving (1) converting crosslinked chloromethylated polystyrene to polystyrene having
pendant phthalimidomethyl groups; (2) converting the phthalimidomethyl groups to
aminomethyl groups; (3) treating the pendant aminomethyl groups with
isopropylisocyanate to thereby make the corresponding isopropylureamethyl groups;
and (4) dehydrating the urea moiety to convert the pendant isopropylureamethyl groups 
to isopropyl carbodiimidomethyl groups. In contrast to Wolman et. al. as discussed
above, the Weinshenker polymeric carbodiimide incorporates carbodiimide units as
pendant
