<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to cosmetic 
compositions. More specifically, the present invention 
relates to cosmetic compositions containing a vinyl-silicone 
graft or block copolymer. Cosmetics are applied to skin, hair, teeth, 
and nails for the purpose of cleansing, and/or 
protecting these personal surfaces from noxious 
external influences, and to provide visual appeal to 
these surfaces. Keeping the body clean is surely the 
first and most primitive demand of personal hygiene 
and, therefore, one of the main purposes of cosmetics. 
Another purpose is to protect such personal surfaces. 
Cleansers protect the skin by removing impurities. 
Disinfectants protect the skin by destroying noxious 
bacteria and fungi. Other preparations act 
prophylactically by isolating the skin from contact 
with harmful external agents. Typical skin protectors are applied before 
skin is exposed to harmful external agents. Ideally, 
such protectors act as an invisible sheath completely 
impenetrable to harmful agents or even deliver 
ingredients that kill harmful bacteria. Skin 
protectors can be differentiated according to their 
specific purposes, e.g., protection against chemical 
agents (caustic chemicals, detergent solutions, etc.); 
protection against dust and soil, tar, and lubricants; 
protection against physical agents (ultraviolet rays 
and heat); protection against mechanical injuries 
(lubricant and massage preparations) and insect 
repellents. In addition to the above discussed purposes  
 
of basic cosmetics, the suppression of body odor or 
personal wetness is also a very important part of 
personal hygiene and therefor also a basic cosmetic 
function. Specific examples of such basic cosmetics 
are, e.g., soaps, detergents, cleansing lotions and the 
like for skin cleaning; shampoos, conditioners and the 
like for hair cleaning and protecting; toothpastes, 
tooth creams, and the like for oral hygiene; creams, 
emulsions, sunscreen preparations, sunburn preventive 
preparations, lubricating and massaging preparations, 
insect repellent preparations and the like to protect 
the skin from harmful effects of either chemicals, dust 
and soil, ultraviolet rays, insects, and other harmful 
agents present in the environment. Antiperspirant, 
foot deodorants, mouthwashes, and the like to improve 
or eliminate odors or personal wetness by eliminating 
bacterial actions, and/or retention of medicament on a 
surface are also within this category of basic 
cosmetic. Another category of cosmetics is the
