<ABSTRACT>
A system and method using canonical telephone numbers which allows 
automatic calling with any location in the world independent of the caller's location. 

The caller canonical telephone number and a plurality of caller prefixes are stored 
within the system. A telephone directory stores a plurality of callee canonical 

telephone numbers for locations throughout the world. The caller manually enters a 
callee telephone number or selects a callee telephone number from the telephone 

directory. The system determines if the callee telephone number is a canonical 
telephone number. The system expands non-canonical telephone numbers to 

canonical form using known telephone numbering rules for various countries. The 
system uses the callee canonical telephone number and the caller canonical telephone 

number to determine which digits of the callee canonical telephone number must be 
placed on the telephone line to complete the call. The system then adds the 

appropriate prefix for international, long distance, or local telephone calls to generate 
a final callee telephone number.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Patent 
Application Serial No. (not yet available), filed June 24, 1993. The invention relates generally to a system and method for 
telephonic communications, and more specifically to a system and method for 
uniquely defining and dialing non-canonical telephone numbers. Telephonic communications has become an accepted part of 
modern society. Even in the most remote portions of the earth, telephone service 
is available through a worldwide telephone communications network. Other 
communication devices, such as facsimile machines, can also use the worldwide 
telephone communications network to send a facsimile message from one remote 
corner of the earth to another, or from one office to another in the same building, 
simply by dialing the appropriate facsimile telephone number. The worldwide 
telephone communications network couples these devices to each other. Obviously, to properly complete a telephone connection a caller 
must know the complete telephone number of the location to which the 
telephone call is placed. A drawback of the current worldwide telephone 
communications network is that the caller must also be aware of the location 
from which the call is being placed (i.e., the caller telephone number). Thus, the 
number and sequence of digits of the callee telephone number is dependent on 
the location of both the caller and the callee. For example, in some locations the caller may have to dial a local 
prefix, such as a "9," to connect to an outside line while other locations do not 
require that a 9 be dialed to connect to an outside line. The caller may be 
required to dial an area code to properly complete a telephone call to one 
location within the United States but not to another more proximate location. 
These location-dependent requirements often cause confusion in placing 
telephone calls and the dialing of telephone numbers incorrectly.  In some situations, the caller may have only a partial callee 
telephone number rather than a complete callee telephone number including 
international prefixes, country code, long distance code, and the like. For 
example, a caller may only have the callee subscriber telephone number 555-1234. 
It may be necessary to add digits to the telephone number to properly 
complete the telephone call. Therefore, it can be appreciated that there is a significant need for 
a system and method for uniquely identifying the callee telephone and placing 
telephone calls in a manner that automatically takes
