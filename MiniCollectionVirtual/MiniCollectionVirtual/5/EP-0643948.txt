<ABSTRACT>
Input data (ID) representative of a model are 
stored in a computer installation (ST) in memory cells 

(DF1). The data-processing equipment operates with a 
program which is directed, by means of first signals (i1) 

generated by one or more first activations of terminal 
members (TER'), to generate, with the aid of the said 

input data, representations of the surface of the body in 
the form of contours of a number of vertical sections 

extending through the centre axis of the body. The 
contours are presented one at a time on the screen of the 

computer installation. By means of second signals (i2), 
the said program is directed to simulate on the cross-sections/contours 

concerned an alteration or extension 
attributable to a variant of the model. With third 

signals (i3), the program is directed to store in memory 
cells (DF2) data attributable to the variant simulated by 

means of the altered or extended vertical sections. The 
latter data form or are utilized to generate output data 

(UD) from the installation (ST). 
It is proposed that Figure 6 should accompany the 
abstract.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
achieving, by means of input data representing a three-dimensional
body usable in the human body, output data
which can be used for manufacturing purposes and represent
an altered or extended variant of the body. As an
example of the said three-dimensional body, a tooth
sleeve, dental bridge or other dental structure can be
mentioned. The said input data are fed to a computer
installation from which the said output data can be
extracted in dependence upon the input data. The computer
installation exhibits a computer screen and operates with
a CADD program (Computer Aided Dental Design).
With the aid of the
said program, an alteration or extension attributable to
the body variant relative to the three-dimensional body
can be simulated. Also included are terminal members, by
means of which the alteration or extension in question is
effected. The invention relates also to a device for
realizing the said process. The process and the device refer
to the technique stated in the preambles of the following
independent claims 1 and 12.By virtue of Swedish patent 9003967-8 (468 198),
which corresponds to EP-A-0 490 848,
it is previously known to utilize computer-aided manufacture
of dental and other products usable in the human
body. The known equipment proposes purely general usage
of computer-aided equipment, in which particular alterations
and extensions can be attached to a model, in
question or to fed-in data representing a model and
design measures relating to the product in question can
be taken with the aid of attached input data.In the case of conventional manual formulation of
tooth sleeves, tooth crowns, etc., the dentist/dental 
technician formulated the model in question which was
dispatched to the manufacturer. When the dentist/dental
technician received the model back, adjustments were made
to it and sent back to the manufacturer, etc., until a
product offering approved results was obtained.Readings of three-dimensional bodies normally
involve large quantities of data. Various measures have
been proposed for keeping these data quantities down.Through said EP patent application it is known
to identify the shape of the body and produce digital representations thereof. It also discloses that it is possible to modify the digital representations
in order to change the shape or size of the body and after that use the modified representations for manufactoring purposes.There is a need to be able to formulate more
exact models at the practice of the
