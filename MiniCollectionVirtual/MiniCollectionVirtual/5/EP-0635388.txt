<ABSTRACT>
In a motor vehicle a control device for manual shifting of a power-shift transmission comprises a finger-operated rocker switch (6) arranged in at least one steering wheel spoke (2), which switch is held on a swivel axis (5) supported in a housing (4) and has an adjusting shift element (7) arranged between two electrical pressure switches (8, 9). The shift element (7) comprises a lever, which is arranged with its free end (20) between operating surfaces (21, 22) of the switches (8, 9), arranged coaxially with one another. The rocker switch (6) is capable of swivelling in relation to the housing (4) about the axis (5) with a shift travel in two directions (12, 13).

<CLAIMS>
An actuating device for shifting a power-shift transmission in a motor vehicle by way of 
a finger-actuated switch situated in a steering-wheel spoke and having gripping surfaces 

arranged in succession for shifting the transmission up and down manually, 
characterized 
in that
 the actuating device is embedded in the steering-wheel spoke by means of a 
casing (4) and comprises a gear-shifting rocker (6), the pivot shaft (5) of which is orientated 

parallel to the longitudinal axis of the steering-wheel spoke, and a gear-shifting 
member (7) of the gear-shifting rocker (6) is pivotable between pressure switches (8, 9) 

arranged coaxially, and the outer surface of the gear-shifting rocker (6) forms a surface 
extending flush with the outer contour of the spoke upholstery (19). 
An actuating device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the gear-shifting 
member (7) comprises a lever (7) which is connected to the gear-shifting rocker (6) and 

is mounted in the casing (4) by way of the pivot shaft (5) and which is arranged with its 
free end (20) between actuation faces (21, 22) of the pressure switches (8, 9). 
An actuating device according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the casing (4) 
holds the pressure switches (8, 9) between wall portions (4a and 4b), wherein the casing 

(4) is arranged between the gear-shifting rocker (6) and the steering-wheel spoke (2) surrounded 
by upholstery (19). 
An actuating device according to Claim 1 or one of the preceding Claims, 
characterized 
in that
 the gear-shifting rocker (6) is provided on its finger-actuated surface with at least 
one depression (14) and a raised portion (15) for actuation purposes. 
An actuating device according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that
 the depression (14) and 
the raised portion (15) are arranged in succession - with respect to a transverse axis 
X-X
 
of the steering wheel - on a rounded outer surface of the gear-shifting rocker (6). 
An actuating device according to Claim 1 or one of the preceding Claims, 
characterized 
in that
 the depression (14) and the raised portion (15) are arranged on both sides of the 
pivot shaft (5). 
An actuating device according to Claim 1 or one of the preceding Claims, 
characterized 
in that
 the highest point (18) of the area of the rounded surface of the gear-shifting  
 

rocker (6) extends substantially in a plane 
Y-Y
 of the highest point of the steering-wheel 
rim and of the steering-wheel impact plate (20). 
An actuating device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 a transverse web (18) is 
formed parallel to the longitudinal axis of the steering-wheel spoke and is curved in a 

convex manner with a curvature along a line (
V
) and has a highest point in the longitudinal 
median axis of the gear-shifting rocker (6), which extends substantially centrally 

through the depressions (14) and raised portions (15). 
An actuating device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 in the case of a four-spoke 
steering wheel one gear-shifting rocker (6) is arranged in each steering-wheel 

spoke.
