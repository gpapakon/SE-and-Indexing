<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is related to novel polypeptide consisting of 
327 amino acids which is produced in a human glioblastoma cell line, a 

method of producing it, DNA encoding the said polypeptide, a fragment 
capable of selectively hybridizing to the DNA sequence, a replication or 

expression vector comprising the DNA and a host cell tranformed with the 
replication or expression vector. The polypeptide of the present invention 

may be useful for the prevention of or in the treatment of aplasia or 
abnormal proliferation, of glias or neurons, depression or enhancement of 

activity, or tumors, diabetes mellitus, diseases caused by abnormal 
glycometabolism or in the treatment diseases related to transaldorase.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to a novel peptide produced by a 
certain cell line and DNAs encoding it. Many factors related to maintain, differentiation, proliferation and 
growth are produced from cells. For example, glia cells which constitute 
brain as a member, produce many factors related to differentiation, 
proliferation and growth of neuro-cells and glia cells. Present inventors have directed their attention to this point and 
energetic research has been carried out in order to find novel factors 
(polypeptides) which glia etc. generate. Until now, when a man skilled in the art intends to obtain a 
particular polypeptide or a DNA encoding it, he generally utilizes methods 
by confirming an intended biological activity in a tissue or in a cell 
medium, isolating and purifying the polypeptide and then cloning a gene or 
methods by "expression-cloning" with the guidance of the biological 
activity. However, physiologically active polypeptides in living body have 
often many kinds of activities. Therefore, it is increasing that after a 
gene is cloned, the gene is found to be identical to that encoding a 
polypeptide already known. Generally glia generates only a very slight 
amount of a factor and it makes difficult to isolate and to purify the 
factor and to confirm its biological activity.  On the other hand, preparation technique of cDNA and sequencing 
technique have been rapidly developed, and it has been able to sequence a 
large quantity of cDNA. Further, methods of "Reverse Genetics" of 
characterizing the function of a gene from the sequence of the gene, have 
been greatly developed. The present inventors attempted to find novel polypeptides by using 
these methods. That is, a series of methods was carried out by isolating 
mRNA from glia etc., obtaining cDNA by using mRNA thus obtained, 
deciding its nucleotide sequence and deducing its amino acid sequence. In 
this manner, the present inventors have succeeded to find a quite novel 
human transaldorase and DNA encoding it, to complete the present 
invention. There was no polypeptide having amino acid sequence which is 
identical to or has high homology to that of the polypeptide of the present 
invention, when amino acid sequences of the polypeptide was compared by 
a computer to all known sequences in data base of Swiss Prot (Swiss Prot 
Release 2.0), except for yeast transaldorase gene. But, there was no human nucleotide sequence which is identical to 
or has high homology to that encoding the polypeptide of the present 
invention,
