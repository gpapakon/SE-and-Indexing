<ABSTRACT>
A display module has an electromechanically driven, chain-shaped information carrier (9) constituted of a number of flat display elements (1) provided on the front or display side (8) with pictures, in particular of different colours, and on the back side (5) with a code (12) for controlling the direction of displacement and the stop position, in particular for use in a matrix-shaped information display board (13). The individual, in particular square-shaped, display elements (1) are provided in the area of two front sides (2) which lie opposite each other in the driving direction (17) with mutually couplable hinge halves (3, 4), in particular in one piece, partially covered by the front or display side (8). On the back side (5) of the individual display elements (1) is provided in a single piece a mechanical driving arrangement (6) for engagement with an electromechanical driving device (7), and the information carrier (9) is guided in the area of the chain longitudinal section (10), in particular in grooves (30).
