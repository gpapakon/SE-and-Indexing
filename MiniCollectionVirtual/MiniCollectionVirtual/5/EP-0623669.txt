<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an aqueous, liquid, hard 
surface cleaning compositions containing amphoteric/zwitterionic 

detergent surfactant, specific anionic surfactant, cleaning 
solvent, optional nonionic detergent surfactant, and buffer. The 

buffers can be either alkaline or acid for improved cleaning of 
acid sensitive soils like soap scum and/or hard water deposits. 

The presence of the specific anionic surfactant permits the 
inclusion of more of relatively hydrophobic materials like cleaning 

solvents, which provide improved cleaning, especially under 
acid conditions where some greasy/oily soils are more difficult to 

remove.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to liquid detergent compositions for
use in cleaning hard surfaces. Such compositions typically
contain detergent surfactants, solvents, builders, etc.The use of solvents and organic water-soluble synthetic
detergents at low levels for cleaning glass are known.General purpose household cleaning compositions for hard
surfaces such as metal, glass, ceramic, plastic and linoleum
surfaces, are commercially available in both powdered and liquid
form. Liquid detergent compositions are disclosed in Australian
Pat. Application 82/88168, filed Sept. 9, 1982, by The Procter &
Gamble Company; U.K. Pat. Application GB 2,166,153A, filed
Oct. 24, 1985, by The Procter & Gamble Company; and U.K. Pat.
Application GB 2,160,887A, filed June 19, 1985, by Bristol-Myers
Company, and U.S. Pat. 5,108,660, Michael, issued Apr. 28, 1992.
These liquid detergent compositions
comprise certain organic solvents, surfactant, and optional
builder and/or abrasive.US 5 108 660 describes a hard surface detergent composition comprising a
hydrocarbylamidoalkylenesulphobetaine, solvent and buffer. The present
invention relates to a similar composition, but additionally comprising a specific
anionic surfactant, described in detail later Liquid cleaning compositions have the great advantage that
they can be applied to hard surfaces in neat or concentrated form
so that a relatively high level of surfactant material and organic
solvent is delivered directly to the soil. Therefore, liquid
cleaning compositions have the potential to provide superior soap
scum, grease, and oily soil removal over powdered cleaning compositions.
Nevertheless, liquid cleaning compositions need even
more cleaning ability to improve their consumer acceptability and
they have to have good spotting/filming properties. In addition, 
they can suffer problems of product form, in particular, inhomogeneity
and/or lack of clarity.An object of the present invention is to provide stable
liquid detergent compositions which provide good glass cleaning
without excessive filming and/or streaking while maintaining good
overall cleaning, preferably including soap scum and greasy/oily
soils.The present invention relates to an aqueous, liquid, hard
surface cleaning composition containing amphoteric/zwitterionic
detergent surfactant; cleaning solvent at a level that can cause
phase separation; specific anionic surfactant, at a level that
prevents said phase separation, which does not adversely affect
filming/streaking characteristics of the composition; optional
non
