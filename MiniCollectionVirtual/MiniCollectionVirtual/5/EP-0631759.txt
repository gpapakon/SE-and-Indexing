<ABSTRACT>
A Clip-inducing apparatus for omega clips (12), in particular 
for laparoscopic operations, consists of a tube-like rod system (1) 

at whose proximal end an operating device (2) and at whose distal 
end a clip-holding and clip-shaping mechanism are provided. The 

rod system (1) comprises an outer guide tube (16) in which there is 
arranged an inner sliding sleeve (17), displaceable coaxially to 

the outer guide tube (16), in which are located an elongated support 
rod (18) fixed relative to the outer guide tube (16) and an elongated 

slide (19) displaceable on the support rod (18). The proximal 
end of the outer guide tube (16) is firmly connected to the handle (3) 

of 
the operating device (2). The movable actuating lever (5) of the 

operating device (2) is in operational connection with the slide 
(19) and the sliding sleeve (17) at their proximal ends in such 

a way that, firstly, the sliding sleeve (17) and the slide (19) 
running ahead of the sliding sleeve (17) are displaced in the 

direction of the distal end, designed as an anvil (27), of the 
fixed support rod (18) and that, after the distal end of the 

slide (19), designed as a tip, has struck the anvil (27), a 
displacement of the sliding sleeve (17) in the same direction 

beyond the distal end of the support rod (18) and of the slide 
(19) is executed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a clip-inducing apparatus for 
laparoscopic surgical operations, whereby the clips (or staples) 
used, made from a bendable filamentary material, are brought 
with the help of the clip-inducing apparatus in the application 
area into a closed shape firmly clamping the tissue located in 
between. According to DE 40 24 106 a clip-inducing apparatus is described 
which consists of a tube-like rod system at the one, distal end 
of which a clip-holding and clip-shaping mechanism is located, 
while the other, proximal end displays an actuation mechanism. The distal end of the clip-inducing apparatus is introduced into 
the patient's abdominal cavity through a cannula and positioned 
e.g. at the vessel to be tied. Through pressure on the 
actuation mechanism, the shaping of the ligature clip and thus 
the clamping of the vessel, e.g. an aorta, is effected via the 
tube-like rod system. According to EP 0 150 826, an endoscopic apparatus for the 
induction of ligature clips is known. With this apparatus, the  
 
distal end is of forceps-like design for the reception and 
shaping of the clip. With the actuation mechanism located at 
the proximal end of the apparatus, the distal end is guided into 
the application area, the clip is laid around the vessel to be 
clamped and shaped by means of the forceps-like formation until 
the vessel is completely clamped. The clips (or staples) used according to the known prior art 
correspond largely in their shape to the form of office staples. 
With modern minimally invasive operation techniques, surgical 
clips are used which are guided by means of a clip-inducing 
apparatus through a cannula to the operation area in the body. 
Since, with the clip-inducing apparatuses described, the clips 
carried along by the induction apparatus are advanced with their 
rectilinear base side crosswise to the longitudinal axis of the 
cannula and the cannula customarily used has a limited opening 
for the guiding through of instruments with a diameter of 5 or 
10 mm, limits are also set to the size of the clips. The 
disadvantage of the described technique is thus that only clips 
of relatively small basic length and thus small circumference 
and small overall size are usable in endoscopic operations 
through cannulae. According to German Patent Application P 42 15 
449.9, a new type of surgical clip, the so-called omega clip, 
was therefore created which is introducible with an induction 
apparatus through a cannula with pre-set diameter and shapable 
into a

project from the distal end of the outer guide tube (16) in 

a manner guaranteeing the clip-holding and clip-shaping 
function of the clip-inducing apparatus, that the proximal 

end of the outer guide tube (16) is firmly connected to the 
handle (3) of the operating device (2) and the movable 

actuating lever (5) of the operating device (2) is in 
operational connection with the slide (19) and the sliding 

sleeve (17) at their proximal ends in such a way that, 
firstly, a displacement of the sliding sleeve (17) and of 

the slide (19) running ahead of the sliding sleeve (17) in 
the direction of the distal end, designed as an anvil (27), 

of the fixed support rod (18) and, after the distal end of 
the slide (19), designed as a tip, has struck the anvil 

(27), a displacement of the sliding sleeve (17) in the same 
direction beyond the distal end of the support rod (18) and 

of the slide (19) is executable, the sliding sleeve (17) 
and the slide (19) being guidable back into the starting 

position in proximal direction upon release of the 
actuating lever (5). 
Clip-inducing apparatus according to claim 1, characterized 
in that a magazine (29) for stocking several omega clips 

(12) is arranged in the sliding sleeve (17) and consists of 
an elongated housing (30) which, inside the sliding sleeve 

(17), surrounds the support rod (18), the slide (19) and a 
series of omega clips (12) lying one behind the other on 

the slide (19), the omega clips (12) being so aligned that 
the tip of the clip engages between the limbs of the clip 

in front and the housing (30) is provided at its outlet end 
lying near to the distal end of the clip-inducin
g apparatus 
with a holding-down device (31) preventing an unintentional 

falling out of the introduced omega clip (12) from the 
clip-holding and clip-shaping mechanism, and at the 

opposite end of the housing (30) a spring-driven stop 
mechanism (32) with distal movement sees to the feeding of 

the front-most omega clip (12) into the space, left free by

lever (5) running above the handle (3) in such a way that 
both the handle (3) and the actuating lever (5) can be 

grasped simultaneously by the operator's hand, and the 
transmission of the manual force onto the clip-inducing 

apparatus takes place via a member (7) which is housed 
pivotable on one side, in the central zone of the actuating 

lever (5), about a cylindrical pin (8) and on the other 
side, in a pressure rod (9) axially displaceable in the 

 
guide bore (4) of the handle (3), about a cylindrical pin

omega clip (12) and the other end-position by the completed 

shaping of the omega clip (12). 
Clip-inducing apparatus according to claim 3, characterized 
in that the sliding sleeve (17) is directly connected to 

the pressure rod (9) and the slide (19) is indirectly in 
active connection with the pressure rod (9) via a coaxially

the operating device (2) is in the starting position, 
advancing of the sliding sleeve (17) and of the slide 
(19) running ahead of the sliding sleeve (17) through the 

 
exertion of pressure on the actuating lever (5) until the 

fixing of the omega clip (12) between the bearing surface 
(28) of the anvil (27) and the tip of the slide (19), 

positioning of the clip-inducing apparatus with its clip-holding 
and clip-shaping mechanism located at the distal 

end at the surgical object, 
further advancing of the sliding sleeve (17) and of the 
slide (19) through continued exertion of pressure on the 

actuating lever (5), during which the tip of the slide (19) 
slides between the limbs of the omega clip (12) and bends 

these open until the advance of the slide (19) is stopped 
by the anvil (21), 
further advancing of the sliding sleeve (17) through 
continued exertion of pressure on the actuating lever (5), 

the distal end of the sliding sleeve (17) being pushed 
beyond the distal end of the support rod (18) and of the 

slide (17) and the limbs of the omega clip (12) being bent 
forward into a shape embracing the surgical object, 
release of the operating lever (5) and thus guiding back 
of the sliding sleeve (17) and of the slide (19) into the 

starting position permitting a loading of the clip-inducing 
apparatus with a next omega clip (12).
