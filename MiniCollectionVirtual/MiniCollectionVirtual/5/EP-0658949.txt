<ABSTRACT>
In a gas-tight NiCd or NiH accumulator of the button-cell type, at least the positive electrode polarity is represented by a pasted electrode having a porous support skeleton comprising a metal foam or metal felt (a foam or felt electrode) instead of the usual compressed powder tablet. In particular, the three-dimensional foam structure with a porosity of approximately 95% promotes a very high volume capacity of 500 to 700 mAh/cm

 of electrode and behaves mechanically stably with respect to the volume work of the nickel hydroxide in cyclic operation.

<CLAIMS>
Gas-tight sealed alkaline NiCd or NiH accumulator in the form of a 
button cell having arranged in the cell housing positive and negative 

electrodes which are separated by a separator, in which the positive 
electrode has a support/diverter framework which is of a porous metal foam 

or metal felt, and in which the active material embedded in the 
support/diverter framework is free of additions of conductive agent. 
Accumulator according to Claim 1, in which the metal forming the 
basis for the foam or felt is nickel. 
Accumulator according to Claim 1 or 2, in which the foam structure 
exhibits 85 to 97%, preferably approximately 95%, open pore volume. 
Accumulator according to one of Claims 1 to 3, in which an 
approximately 5% proportion of the electrode volume is metal foam. 
Accumulator according to one of Claims 1 to 4, in which the specific 
volume capacity of the positive electrode is from 650 to 700 mAh.
