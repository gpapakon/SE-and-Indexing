<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a spatial
coherent light transmission apparatus for use in an
optical communication system or the like.The spatial data transmission using light, which
is free from indoor interference unlike a transmission
using an electric wave as a medium, has been conventionally
used for an information transmission for a short
distance.This transmission system has employed an intensity
modified detection (IMDD) method in which a light
emission diode (LED) is used as a transmission light
source and the modulation of the light intensity thereof
allows data to be decoded. On the other hand, a spatial
light transmission apparatus using a coherent detection
technique has been put into practical use.In these days, data transmission such as digital
moving image transmission is required to perform the
transmission with a higher speed. However, data transmission
for a long distance has been impossible because
the optical current power decreases in proportion to the
communication distance to the fourth power.For example, the transmission side uses an LED
having an emission power of 100 mW diffusing light over
±60 degrees for a spatial transmission while the receiving
side has a light receiving portion in the shape of a 
circle with a diameter of 1 cm. In this case, the
communication distance, which allows the transmission
speed to be 100 Mbit/s and the transmission bit error
rate (BER) to be 10-9, with the use of a baseband modulation,
is 1 m or less. Hereinafter, it is assumed that
the BER is less than 10-9 where a signal to noise ratio
(SNR) is 20 dB.The conventional spatial transmission apparatus
using a coherent light detection will be described.Figure 1 is a diagram showing the configuration
of a beat signal detection device for use in a conventional
wireless optical communication system. As shown
in Figure 1, a signal beam 1 is incident through an
incidence window portion 2 having a collective lens.
Then, the signal beam 1 passes through an optical multiplexer/demultiplexer
3 and is incident onto one of light
receiving elements 4a of a light receiving element array
4. On the other hand, a locally oscillated beam is
generated from a semiconductor laser 5 and is collimated
by a collimator lens 6. Thereafter, the locally oscillated
beam is diffused by a diffusion optical element 7
and becomes a diffused locally oscillated beam 8, which
is diffusion plane waves. The travelling direction of
the locally oscillated diffused beam 8 is changed by an
optical multiplexer/demultiplexer 3.
