<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a medical use 
of Cytarabine Ocfosfate. More particularly, the present 
invention relates to a use of Cytarabine Ocfosfate for 
preventing liver metastasis of cancer and for the 
treatment of liver cancer. Chemotherapy has failed so far to provide any 
effective treatment for preventing liver metastasis of 
cancer accompanied by progress of cancer or surgical 
operation in patients with cancer. It is the actual 
situation that chemotherapy is relied upon supplementary 
treatment by anti-tumor agents, e.g., 5-FU or 
epiadriamycin. However, the effect of these anti-tumor 
agents is not satisfactory. Cytarabine Ocfosfate (1-β-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine-5'-stearylphosphate 
monosodium 
salt monohydrate) is a derivative of Ara-C and known as 
an oral anti-tumor agent (Japanese Patent Application  
 
KOKOKU No. 57-48091 and U.S. Patent No. 4,542,021). It 
is also known that this compound is metabolized in liver 
to Ara-C (Nagahata et al., Anti-tumor Effect of Novel 
Cytarabine derivative 4-Amino-1-β-D-Arabinofuranosyl-2(1H)-Pyrimidinone 
5'-(Sodium-Octadecyl Phosphate) 
Monohydrate (YNKO1), GAN-TO-KAGAKU-RYOHO (Cancer & 
Chemotherapy), 17 (8), 1437-1445 (1990); Nakagawa Y. et 
al., Studies on the metabolism of YNKO1 (in Japanese), 
in Proceedings of 106th annual meeting of the Japan 
Pharmaceutical Society, p. 528 (1986)). For radical treatment of cancer, it is 
important not only to treat a primary site of the cancer 
but also to prevent metastasis of, especially 
gastrointestinal cancer or lung cancer to liver. It is 
thus desired a drug effective for preventing metastasis 
to liver. In addition, liver tumor including both 
metastatic and primary tumor is treated only with 
difficulty. It is also desired a drug effective for 
liver tumor, which can be continuously administered 
orally over a long period of time. The present inventors have found that 
Cytarabine Ocfosfate is excellent in oral absorption, 
has an activity for preventing liver metastasis of 
cancer, and is effective for liver cancer including both 
primary and metastatic cancer.  Therefore, an object of the present invention 
is to provide a pharmaceutical composition for 
preventing liver metastasis of cancer and a 
pharmaceutical composition for the treatment of liver 
cancer, comprising as an effective ingredient Cytarabine 
Ocfosfate represented by formula (1) below: 
   Another object of the present invention is to 
provide a method for preventing liver metastasis of 
cancer and a method for the treatment
