<ABSTRACT>
This invention proposes a handling-switching apparatus 
in which the pieces to be handled are placed on 

conveyor tables constituted by rotating carpets (1) that are 
inclined and set to rotation to unload the conveyed 

piece. The path, loop shaped, develops on a vertical 
plane and a characteristic of the invention is that 

means (12,13,15) to keep in the horizontal position the carpets (1) 
even in the sections connecting the upper to the lower 

part of the path and conversely are provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention proposes a handling-switching apparatus 
comprising a number of conveyor tables, each constituted 
by a rotating carpet on which the piece to be handled is 
placed and that is dragged along a loop path developing 
on a vertical plane. A characteristic of the invention is that means suitable 
to keep in the horizontal position the carriages even in 
that part of their path that connects the upper to the 
lower section of the path and conversely are provided. Handling-switching apparatuses in which the pieces to be 
handled are placed on a carriage fitted with a rotating 
carpet that constitutes the conveyor table and that is 
dragged along a fixed path, specifically a loop path 
developing on a vertical plane, are known. In some of such apparatuses unloading takes place by 
tilting the carriage and setting to rotation the carpet, 
to unload the piece towards underlying collecting 
devices. One of such apparatuses is known through the Italian 
Patent Application MI A 2213 dated 06.08.1991 of the 
same applicant.  
 In such handling-switching apparatuses carriages with 
carpets are dragged by a pair of belts or chains, that 
are driven by gearwheels provided at both ends of the 
apparatus. The path includes then two sections, an upper and a 
lower one, said sections being essentially rectilinear 
and connected by two semicircular sections. The pieces are introduced into the machine in 
correspondence with loading areas provided at the 
apparatus head ends and are unloaded when they come to 
pass in correspondence with some collecting devices 
suitably predisposed, associated with that piece in a 
known way by means of a coding operation at the moment 
of loading. In some known apparatuses the carriages, passing from the 
upper to the lower section of their path or conversely, 
perform a 180Â° rotation, thereby overturning. Owing to this reason, it is necessary that the pieces be 
unloaded before the carriage reaches the end of the 
rectilinear section of its path, and this constitutes a 
remarkable operating limitation. EP-A-0 083 500 discloses a turning device for a multi-level conveyor comprising a set of 
trays mounted on chains which pass along a series of horizontal levels and includes 
reciprocating mechanisms which maintain the trays in a horizontal position as they 
change levels. This invention proposes a handling-switching apparatus as hereinbefore 
described, that is however characterized by the 
means which keep in the horizontal position the  
 
carriages even when they run
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A handling-switching machine including a number of 
carriages which move along a loop path in a vertical plane, and are each fitted 

with a 
rotating belt and a carriage shaft (7) which connects said carriage (1) to 

a pair of chains or 
belts (5) that are driven by horizontal-axle driving wheels (3), 

and means suitable to keep each 
carriage in a substantially horizontal position during 

the movement between the upper and the lower sections of 
the path, 

characterized in that said means consist of a number of 
shafts (13) that are radially mounted, with rotation 

possibility only, on said driving wheels (3), 
each shaft being fitted with a pair of bevelled 

gearwheels (12, 15); the first one (12) engaging with a 
fixed gearwheel (11) that is coaxially arranged w
ith the 
driving wheel shaft (10), the second one (15) engaging with a 

gearwheel (16) that is integrally connected with said 
carriage shaft (7).
