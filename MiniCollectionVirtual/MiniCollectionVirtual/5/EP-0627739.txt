<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for recording and/or reproducing a 
disc-shaped recording medium records and/or reproduces 

information signals on or from the recording medium having 
an information recording region for recording information 

signals and a table-of-contents region for recording at 
least the number data and the title data of the 

information signals recorded in the information recording 
region. The recording and/or reproducing apparatus 

includes a recording and/or reproducing unit and a display 
unit. Within the recording and/or reproducing unit, a 

plurality of disc-shaped recording media are disposed and 
arranged co-planarly in a side-by-side relation to one 

another. The recording and/or reproducing unit records the 
information signals on a selected one of the disc-shaped 

recording media and/or reproduces the information signals 
from the selected disc-shaped recording medium. The 

display unit, which has its control operation controlled 
by an output signal from an output signal of the recording 

and/or reproducing unit, has a first display region for 
displaying data recorded in the table-of-contents region 

and a second display region having the same display 
configuration as the arraying state of the disc-shaped 

recording media. The second display region is 
simultaneously employed as a display area for indicating 

the audio sound hearing position controlled by a sound 
field controller

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a recording and/or
reproducing apparatus for a disc-shaped recording medium.
More particularly, it relates to a recording and/or
reproducing apparatus for a disc-shaped recording medium,
and a sound reproducing apparatus, in which information
signals may be recorded on or reproduced from one of
plural disc-shaped recording media.Recently, as in-car sound reproducing apparatus,
optical disc reproducing apparatus have become popular in
addition to the cassette decks or tuners, and are being
diversified in their functions. The optical disc
reproducing apparatus includes a magazine capable of
containing plural optical discs. The disc reproducing
apparatus having a so-called disc exchange function, that
is, capable of selectively reproducing the optical discs
contained in the magazine, referred to hereinafter simply
as a changer, has become predominant.EP 0 453 064 discloses a multi-disc player which
displays a table listing the titles of discs held.As an example, a magazine 201 of such changer,
capable of containing six optical discs D therein, as
shown in Fig.1, is configured to accommodate six optical
discs D so that the planar surfaces of the discs D lie
horizontally with a vertical clearance from one another.
The discs D are termed the first, 
second, and so forth, up to the sixth as counted from the bottom
to the uppermost side.The changer includes an operating panel for realizing a
variety of operations, such as the playback operation or the
optical disc selecting operation, and a display unit for listing
the number or the title of the discs D contained in the changer.
The list display configuration is shown in Fig.2, in which the
discs D are indicated as "1", "2", ··· "6" as counted from the
uppermost side, thus in the reverse order to the arraying order
of the discs D in the magazine, and the title of the optical disc
bearing the associated number is also displayed.In a changer capable of containing ten optical discs, the
display is made in five rows in two columns, owing to the
constraint in the display area of the display unit, as shown in
Fig.3. The left column is numbered 1 to 5, while the right
column is numbered 6 to 10, and the title concerning the optical
disc bearing the disc number is also displayed.Recently, the number of the optical disc being reproduced
is displayed in a unique color, or the number and the title of
the disc are displayed with brightness inversion.Fig.4 shows another conventional display configuration for
the display unit, according to which a
