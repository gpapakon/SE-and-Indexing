<ABSTRACT>
A device for collecting refuse, such as GFG, glass, paper, coarse refuse, comprises a refuse container having an insert opening in or near the top wall and a sealable discharge opening for emptying the refuse container. In operation, the refuse container is placed partially underground. On the one hand, the device may include an outer casing to be built at least partially into the ground and in which the refuse container is placeable and removable therefrom to empty it, while on the other hand the refuse container may be built stationary into the ground and the insert opening being arranged in an upper lid which is removable for opening an upwardly turned discharge opening for connection to a loading tube or transfer bunker of a garbage truck.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for collecting
refuse, such as glass, paper, coarse refuse and the
like, according to the preamble of claim 1.In current devices for collecting refuse, one or more
containers for different separated types of refuse are
arranged on the sidewalk or, for example, on parking
places, which is a "visual pollution" of the street image
and occupies a lot of space. Furthermore, it is often difficult
to fill the containers since the insert opening is
arranged relatively high.A device for collecting refuse according to the preamble
of claim 1 is described as prior art in DE-U-90 04
988 (page 2, last paragraph - page 4, first paragraph).The object of the present invention is to provide an
improved device for collecting refuse.The device according to the invention is characterized
by the features of the characterizing part of claim 1.According to the invention, the hole in the ground
caused by the empty outer casing is protected thereby
preventing people from falling into it.The invention will hereafter be elucidated with reference
to the drawing very schematically showing two
embodiments of devices for collecting refuse, where the
casing is only partially underground and the safety
means are not shown, contrary to the claims.Fig. 1 is a vertical longitudinal section of a first
embodiment of a device for collecting refuse.Fig. 2 shows a modification of the embodiment of
the device of Fig. 1, which is particularly intended for
moisture containing refuse.The drawings show devices for collecting refuse, in
particular separated household and industrial refuse,
such as glass, paper, chemical waste, GFG, textile and
other refuse which is removed separately, said devices
being arranged mainly along side public roads, in particular
in dwelling environments.The refuse collecting device as shown comprises an
outer casing 1 which, in this case, is arranged partially
underground and is intended to substantially receive a
refuse container 2 therein. The outer casing 1 is made
of steel and is anchored in the soil with an enlarged base
plate 3. The outer casing 1 in this case has a circular
cross section and a longitudinal shape but may also
assume other shapes depending on the use. The refuse
container 2 which is also cylindrical is submerged for the
greater part in the outer casing 1 and has a cylindrical
side wall 4, a bottom wall serving as lid 5 for opening and
closing a discharge opening, and a top wall 6. A lug 7 is
welded on the top wall 6 to enable a loading crane to pull
the
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Device for collecting refuses, such as glass, paper,
coarse refuse and the like, comprising an outer casing

(1) to be built into the ground such that the casing will extend only underground, and a rigid refuse
container (2) adapted to be placed in the outer casing

(1) and having a hoist engagement means to be
lifted therefrom in order to be emptied, the refuse

container (2) having an insert opening (14) in or near
the upper wall and a discharge opening in its bottom

part closable by a closure means (5), the refuse container
(2) having an overground part and an underground

part and the cross section of the overground
part being smaller than that of the underground part,


characterized
 in that there are provided safety
means including a fence or inner casing rising automatically

through raising means when the refuse container
is hoisted from the outer casing to prevent

people passing by to fall into the outer casing (1),
wherein the raising

means includes a spring device or counter weights.
Device according to claim 1,
wherein the closure means (5) of the discharge

opening is a lid means.
Device according to claim 2, wherein the lid means
(5) is connected to the overlying part of the refuse

container (2) by a pivot (8).
Device according to claim 2 or 3 wherein the lid
means (5) is bowl-shaped such that a division

between said lid means and the overlying part of the
refuse container (2) is at a distance above the bottom

of the container (2) formed by said lid means.
