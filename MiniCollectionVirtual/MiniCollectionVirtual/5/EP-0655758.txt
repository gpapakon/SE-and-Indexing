<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a light emitting push button 
for operating purposes, for instance a number button on a 

telephone apparatus, wherein the push button includes a body 
which is double-molded from two different plastic materials, 

of which one material is light conductive and the other is 
opaque. A light emitting device, such as a light emitting 

diode, is arranged to emit light on the underside of the push 
button so that the light is conducted through the light 

conductor material and is emitted on the upper side of the 
button. According to the invention a slot (5) is formed 

between the light conductive material (3) and the opaque 
material (2) on the upper side of the button (1), such that 

light conducted through the light conductive material (3) will 
be scattered uniformly and therewith visible from all directions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a light-emitting push button
according to the preamble of claim 1, as for example known from US-A-4 924 044.Light-emitting push buttons of the aforedescribed kind are
known to the art. Although the majority of existing buttons
provided with light conductors light up well, there is often
an angle or angles of incidence at which the light almost
disappears, depending on the line of sight. The lens requires
free surfaces around the lens, in order for the light to be
reflected from the sides and so as to obtain the best possible
light yield at the top of the button. A light conductor
integrated in such a double-molded button, for instance in
telephone apparatus, makes it difficult to discern whether the
button is lit or not when viewed in a direction towards the
button, because the light is not scattered uniformly at the
upper surface of the button.This is because the material in the button and the lens is
fused or migrated together by heat in the molding process, and
the light reflections in this part is "extinguished" or
dampened out. A light conductor which is completely molded in
would dampen the reflection of light excessively. An object of the present invention is to avoid the drawback of
not being able to see the light from all directions, and to
provide a press button in which light is scattered uniformly
at the top of the button, such that the light yield at the
button top will be the best possible for all angles of
incidence. This object is achieved by forming an air gap or
slot which extends to slightly below the top of the lens,
between button and lens, so that light will be reflected
against the lens surface thus exposed.An inventive push button affords the advantage that the light
yield will be practically uniform in all directions, or in
other words there are found no angles of incidence at which
the light will disappear irrespective of the line of sight,
but that the button will be clearly visible from all directions.The invention will now be described in more detail with
reference to an exemplifying embodiment thereof and also with
reference to the accompanying drawing.Figure 1 is a perspective view of an inventive light emitting
push button; andFigure 2 and Figure 3 are perspective views of alternative
embodiments of an inventive light-emitting push button.Figure 1 illustrates in perspective a preferred embodiment of
a light-emitting push button 1. The push button 1 is ellipsoidal
in shape and includes a double-molded body of opaque 
material 2 and a light
