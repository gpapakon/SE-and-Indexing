<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for ethylene polymerization
and copolymerization of ethylene with an alpha-olefin, and a
catalytic composition active in this (co)polymerization.It is known in the art that ethylene, and alpha-olefins in
general, can be polymerized by the Ziegler low pressure process.For this purpose, catalysts are used generally formed from a
compound of elements from group IV to group VI of the periodic
table (transition metal compounds) in mixture with an
organometallic compound or hydride of elements from group I to
group(III of the periodic table, operating in suspension, in
solution or in the gaseous phase.The transition metal generally used for this purpose is titanium,
which allows high yields and productivity especially in ethylene
polymerization. However, combinations of titanium with other
transition metals such as vanadium, zirconium and hafnium are also
used in the preparation of ethylene polymers and copolymers with
specific characteristics. In particular, the titanium-vanadium
combination is often used in the preparation of ethylene
copolymers with homogeneous comonomer distribution within the
molecule, and having good mechanical characteristics and improved
workability, especially when operating with processes using a 
polymerization temperature exceeding about 150°C and hence
requiring catalysts with a reduced number of beta-elimination
reactions. These catalyst components are generally prepared by
contact, under reaction conditions, between a titanium compound
(generally titanium tetrachloride), a vanadium compound (generally
vanadium oxychloride) and an alkylaluminium chloride, as described
for example in European patent application No. 57,050.The main drawback of these catalytic components is their
relatively low activity in polymerization, this requiring
expensive purification of the polymer to remove catalyst residues.From US patents 4,037,041 and 4,151,110 it is also known to
prepare catalyst components from titanium tetrachloride and
vanadium carbonyl as zerovalent vanadium compound. However these
catalyst components also exhibit poor activity under usual
polymerization conditions and in addition vanadium carbonyls are
compounds difficult to produce and difficult to handle in a
commercial plant. A polymerization catalyst containing vanadium
and titanium, with good catalytic activity, is described in US
patent 4,987,111. According to this patent a solid catalyst
component is definable, in atomic proportions, by the formula
V(1), Ti(n), Cl(4n) where n varies from
