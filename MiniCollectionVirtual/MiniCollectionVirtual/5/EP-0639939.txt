<ABSTRACT>
A fast atom beam source which is capable of 
efficiently emitting a fast atom beam with low energy 

and high particle flux. A plate-shaped electrode (21) 
has a multiplicity of atom emitting holes (7). A pair 

of electrodes (22 and 28) are disposed in series to face 
opposite to the plate-shaped electrode so as to form an 

electric discharge part. A power supply (24) applies 
an AC voltage between the pair of electrodes. A power 

supply (29) applies a DC voltage between the plate-shaped 
electrode and one of the pair of electrodes that is closer 

to the plate-shaped electrode. A gas inlet part (4) 
introduces a gas (5) to induce electric discharge in the 

space between the plate-shaped electrode and the pair of 
electrodes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fast atom
beam source which is capable of emitting a fast atom
beam efficiently at a relatively low discharge voltage.
Atoms and molecules have a thermal motion in the
atmosphere at room temperature with a kinetic energy of
about 0.05 eV. "Fast atoms" are atoms and molecules that
have a kinetic energy much larger than 0.05 eV, and when
such particles are emitted in one direction, they are
called "fast atom beam".Fig. 5 shows one example of the structure of a
fast atom beam source as disclosed in the prior art document EP-A-0 531 949 that emits argon atoms with a kinetic
energy of 0.5 to 10 keV, among conventional fast atom beam
sources designed to generate fast beams of gas atoms.
In the figure, reference numeral 1 denotes a cylindrical
cathode, 2 a doughnut-shaped anode, 3 a DC high-voltage
power supply (0.5 to 10 kV), 4 a gas nozzle, 5 argon gas, 6
plasma, 7 fast atom emitting holes, and 8 a fast atom beam.
The operation of the conventional fast atom beam source is
as follows:
The constituent elements, exclusive of the DC high-voltage
power supply 3 and a discharge stabilizing resistor
(not shown), are incorporated in a vacuum container (not
shown). After the vacuum container has been sufficiently
evacuated, argon gas 5 is injected into the inside of the
cylindrical cathode 1 from the gas nozzle 4. Meanwhile,
a DC voltage is imposed between the anode 2 and the cathode
1 from the DC high-voltage power supply 3 in such a manner
that the anode 2 has a positive potential, and the cathode
1 a negative potential. Consequently, electric discharge
occurs between the cathode 1 and the anode 2 to generate
plasma 6, thus producing argon ions and electrons. During
this process, electrons that are emitted from one end face
of the cylindrical cathode 1 are accelerated toward the
anode 2 and pass through the central hole in the anode 2 to
reach the other end face of the cathode 1. The electrons
reaching the second end face lose their speed. Then, the 
electrons are turned around and are accelerated toward the
anode 2 to pass again through the central hole of the anode
2 before reaching the first end face of the cathode 1.
Such repeated motion of electrons forms a high-frequency
vibration between the two end faces of the cylindrical
cathode 1 across the anode 2, and while making the repeated
motion, the electrons collide with the argon gas to produce
a large number of argon ions.The argon ions produced in this way are accelerated
toward each end face of the cylindrical cathode 1 to
