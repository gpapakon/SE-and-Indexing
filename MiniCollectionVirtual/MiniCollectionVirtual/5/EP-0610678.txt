<ABSTRACT>
A number of embodiments of induction system for internal 
combustion engines employing multiple intake valves. The 

induction systems are designed so as to provide substantially 
unrestricted charging and axial flow into the cylinder bore 

when running under high-speed, high-load conditions. A 
control valve (68) is provided which changes the effective 

configuration of the induction passages so as to provide a 
slant tumble action under lower speed and load conditions. 

Various arrangements are disclosed for altering the amount of 
slant action and providing slant actions in opposite or the 

same direction. In addition, a single control valve element (68) 
is provided for achieving this effect in a three poppet valve 

per cylinder engine.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an induction system for an internal combustion engine
comprising a cylinder block having a cylinder bore, a piston reciprocating in said cylinder
bore, a cylinder head affixed to said cylinder block in closing said cylinder bore to define
with said piston and said cylinder bore a combustion chamber, a plurality of intake valve
seats formed in said cylinder head and forming respective intake ports serving said
combustion chamber, poppet valves associated with said intake valve seats and
supported for reciprocation by said cylinder head for opening and closing said intake
ports, induction passage means terminating at said intake ports for supplying an
induction charge to said combustion chamber, and a single control valve means movable
in said induction passage means between a first position wherein the flow into the
combustion chamber is substantially unrestricted and a second position wherein the flow
into said combustion chamber is redirected, whereas at least three intake valve seats
and respective intake ports and intake valves are provided, and said intake valve seats
and said induction passage means being configured so as to direct the charge entering
said combustion chamber in a generally axial direction and being substantially
unrestricted and that in said second position the flow is redirected to generate a tumble
action within the combustion chamber.As is well known, the induction system of an internal
combustion engine is extremely important in determining the
performance of the engine. Also, with conventional induction
systems, the induction system is designed so as to provide a
compromise between the requirements of high-speed and low-speed
performance. That is, to achieve maximum high-speed
performance, the induction system should be designed so as to
permit maximum charging of the cylinder. This can be
achieved by providing relatively large unrestricted flow
passages and in which the intake charge enters the cylinder
in a direction so as to flow generally parallel to the axis
of the cylinder bore. Although the described type of induction system provides
high power outputs, the unobstructed flow and large flow
areas tend to reduce the flow velocity entering the cylinder
when the engine is operated at low and mid-range speeds.
Under these conditions, it is desirable to have the flow
velocity entering the chamber to be more rapid and also to
introduce some turbulence so as to improve the flame
propagation and combustion. However, these turbulence
increasing devices
