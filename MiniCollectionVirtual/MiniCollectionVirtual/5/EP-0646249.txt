<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for detecting abnormalities in a line to be examined, in which a signal reflected in the line is detected when a pulsed signal is fed into the line. In order to be able to implement this process particularly quickly and with high precision, a weighting function with a time variation is formed which is characteristic for the behaviour of a line of the same type as the line (1) to be examined when a pulse is applied to it. A single pulse is applied to the line (1) to be examined and the detected reflected signal is weighed with the weighting factor as part of a convolution operation.

Method for determining anomalies of a line 
which is to be examined, wherein 


in response to application of pulse signals to the 
line at its one end a signal which is reflected in 

the line is detected at the same end of the line, 
 
characterised in that 


a weighting function is formed that has a time 
characteristic which is typical of the behaviour 

of a line, which is of the same type as the 
respective line (1) to be examined, when pulses 

are applied thereto, 
a single pulse, as the pulse-application, is 
applied to the respective line (1) to be examined, 

and 
the detected reflected signal (S) is weighted 
within the framework of a convolution operation 

with the weighting function. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in 
that 


the weighting function is formed in consideration 
of the various rise times (tr) of detected 

reflected pulses (S) which have emerged on account 
of anomalies, which are found at different points, 

of the line which is of the same type. 
Method according to claim 1 or 2,
 
characterised in that 


the weighting function is formed in consideration 
of the various peak values of detected reflected 

pulses which have emerged on account of anomalies, 
which are found at different points, of the line 

which is of the same type. 
Method according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that 


the reflected signal (S) is scanned and the scan 
values thereby obtained are stored whilst  

 
retaining their order in time, and 
a weighting function is used that effects a 
constant or different weighting of the scan values 

by means of a different number of, in each case, 
temporally successive scan values. 
Method according to claim 4, characterised in 
that 


weighted scan values Y
i
 are formed in the manner 
of a respective mean-value generation in 

accordance with the relationship 

Y
i
 = 
1
N
max
 · ∑x
i-n
 
with 


n=1...N
max
 
and 


N
max
=tr' 
 
where N
max
 denotes the number of scan values 
which are used to establish the respective mean 

value, n denotes a run index, x(i-n) denotes the 
unweighted scan values which are considered in 

each case and tr denotes the rise time. 
Method according to one of the claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that 


the weighting of the detected reflected signal is 
effected by means of an analog-filter, to which 

the signal is supplied on the input side.
