<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides a method of in vitro immunization of cells with an antigen to produce antibodies against that antigen, the method comprising incubating the cells with the antigen and support cells in which the support cells have previously been primed with the antigen prior to incubation with the cells to be immunized.

<DESCRIPTION>
 IN VITRO ANTIBODY PRODUCTIONThis invention relates to in vitro antibody production, and in particular monoclonal antibody production.Since the work of Milstein _ KÎ´hler the priming of rodent B cells with antigens has largely been accomplished by animal immunization. .In vitro immunization, that is to say a tissue culture-based primary system which permits rapid primary activation of antigen-specific cells has hitherto seldom been used because the resulting hybridomas produce antibodies which are predominately of the IgM structural type or class. IgM antibodies are of relatively low affinity and are of limited general application compared to antibodies of the IgG or IgA structural type or class.Human monoclonal antibodies offer the advantage of minimizing the adverse reactions which can result from the administration of foreign (i.e rodent) antibody protein to the human body. However, routine human monoclonal antibody production is not common because of the dangers and ethical problems of immunizing humans with certain antigens and the difficulty of collecting suitable primed B cells. Recent efforts with human monoclonal antibodies produced by in vivo immunisation have focused on the use of chemical molecular modification to change specificities.SUBSTITUTESHEET 

 Therefore there is a need for an efficient method for in vitro immunization which results in an increased yield of IgG/IgA antibodies.Further advantages of jLn, vitro immunization include (1) the ability to maintain specific concentrations of antigen during the immunization, (2) the effect of various monokines and lymphokines (cytokines) at various concentrations can be tested, (3) periodic sampling of the same culture is possible during the course of a culture, (4) it is possible to produce antibodies to "self" antigens which are not produced .in vitro due to suppression or tolerance, (5) use of very small quantities (compared to in vivo) of antigen, (6) potential for use of antigens toxic in vivo, (7) short time course with respect to in vivo; (8)enhanced yield of IgA with respect to in vivo immunisation; (9) antigens which are very small, such as some peptides, can be successfully used for immunization; and (10) the undesirable use of laboratory animals can be reduced.Reading (J. Im unological Methods .53. (1982) 261-291) reviews in vitro immunization and describes a method of in vitro immunization in which spleen cells from an unprimed mouse are mixed with thymocyte conditioned medium. Thymocyte conditioned medium contains monokines and
