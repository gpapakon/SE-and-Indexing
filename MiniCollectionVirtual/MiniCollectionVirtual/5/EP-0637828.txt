<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a multilayer
electronic component which is provided in its interior
with internal circuit elements, a method of manufacturing
such multilayer electronic components and a method of
measuring characteristics thereof, and more particularly,
it relates to an improvement in a mode of formation of
external electrodes in such a multilayer electronic
component.A multilayer electronic component such as a
multilayer capacitor, a multilayer inductor, a multilayer
circuit board or a multilayer composite electronic
component, for example, comprises a laminate which is
formed by stacking a plurality of insulating sheets with
interposition of internal circuit elements such as
conductor films and/or resistor films. The insulating
sheets are typically prepared from ceramic sheets.Fig. 6 is a perspective view showing the appearance
of a conventional multilayer electronic component 1, which 
is of interest to the present invention. The multilayer
electronic component 1 comprises a laminate 2, which is
formed by stacking a plurality of insulating sheets with
interposition of internal circuit elements (not shown).
External electrodes 3 are formed on four side surfaces,
for example, of the laminate 2 respectively. These
external electrodes 3 are electrically connected with the
internal circuit elements which are positioned in the
interior of the laminate 2. While the external electrodes
3 are formed by applying proper metal films to specific
portions of the respective side surfaces of the laminate
2, parts of the external electrodes 3 necessarily extend
toward upper and lower major surfaces of the laminate 2
with relatively wide areas.Such a multilayer electronic component 1 is surface-mounted
on a proper circuit board through the external
electrodes 3, in the form of a chip.In the aforementioned multilayer electronic component
1, however, the external electrodes 3 are formed to extend
toward the upper and lower major surfaces of the laminate
2 with relatively wide areas. When another electronic
component is mounted on either major surface of the
multilayer electronic component 1 to be composed with the
same, an area capable of mounting such an electronic
component is restricted. In order to manufacture such multilayer electronic
components 1, the laminate 2 is independently prepared for
each multilayer electronic component 1 and then provided
with the aforementioned external electrodes 3, while the
same is subjected to formation of a resistor film on its
surface, trimming of the resistor
