<ABSTRACT>
Thermoplastic blend characterised in that it includes a fluoropolymer, an aromatic polyester and a compatibility agent resulting from the copolymerisation of monomers of ethylene, of glycidyl acrylate and of acrylate, and optionally of peroxide. This blend is particularly recommended for the manufacture of articles employed in the chemical engineering field, which articles must withstand highly corrosive chemical environments. This blend is also recommended for applications related to the cable-making field, in particular those involving electricity transmission at high frequencies.
