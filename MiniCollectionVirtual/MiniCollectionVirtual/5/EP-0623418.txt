<ABSTRACT>
Holder (6) for hinges (1), particularly of the Anuba 
type, that are accordingly constituted by a male element 

(2) and/or by a female element with a threaded stem (5). 
The holder (6) is constituted by a parallelepipedal support 

(7) made of pressboard and having a plurality of first 
mutually interconnected seats (12) and second seats (16) 

which are separate from the first seats (12) and axially 
aligned therewith. The first seats (12) allow to guide the 

threaded stem (5) of the hinges (1), whereas the second 
seats (16) lock the stem (5) temporarily to allow easy and 

quick loading of the hinges (1) in machines known as Anuba 
hinge drivers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a holder for hinges, 
particularly hinges of the so-called "Anuba" type that are 
accordingly constituted by a male element and by a female 
element which each have a threaded stem. These known hinges are currently installed in the 
casement mainly with automatic machines termed Anuba hinge 
drivers. These hinge drivers insert, by means of screwer 
chucks, the threaded stem of the male or female element at 
an adapted hole formed in the casement. These hinge drivers remove the male or female element 
from a magazine which must be pre-loaded by the operator by 
inserting the individual male or female elements so that 
they are mutually superimposed and pre-orientated so that 
in said magazine the threaded hinge stems protrude 
externally so that they can be gripped by the screwer 
chucks. A problem that currently arises in the known art is 
the loading of the magazine with the hinges so as to pre-orientate 
them. As a partial solution to the drawback of having to 
manually insert the hinges one by one, the same Applicant 
devised the use of a rectangular piece of cardboard on 
which multiple separate holes are formed beforehand in 
sequence; the threaded stems of a number of male or female 
elements are inserted at these holes, and said elements are 
thus pre-orientated and sequentially ordered. The operator then inserts the bodies of the male or 
female hinge at an adapted slot formed in the magazine of  
 
Anuba hinge drivers and then tears the cardboard. However, this solution has considerable drawbacks that 
reduce and penalize its use: the male or female elements 
pre-inserted at the piece of cardboard lose their 
alignment, since the cardboard is not rigid and the body of 
the hinges tends to rotate with respect to the hole in 
which the threaded stem is inserted. This entails the presence of an operator who 
continuously manually realigns the hinges, thus making it 
pointless to load said hinges since such loading is again 
comparable to individual manual loading in terms of time 
wasted. Furthermore, the rectangular piece of cardboard is 
difficult to handle due to its flexibility and tendency to 
yield easily, and it can tear or the hinges can slip out of 
their holes. An increase in the thickness of the cardboard is not 
feasible, since it would become more difficult to tear it 
once the hinge bodies have been inserted in the Anuba hinge 
driver. Finally, attention is drawn to the fact that it is 
necessary to provide pieces of cardboard with suitable and 
differ

A holder (6) for 
holding in an aligned manner 

a plurality of hinges (1) each 
with a threaded stem (5), 

in particular hinges of the Anuba type, 
the holder comprising: 


a support (7) having a lateral surface (11) and an 
internal surface (10) which is spaced from said lateral 

surface (11); 
at least one series of first holes (13) provided 
through said lateral surface (11) such that the stems (5) 

of the hinges (1) may be inserted through and supported by 
said first holes (13); 
at least one series of slots (14) also provided 
through said lateral surface (11) and extending between the 

first holes (13) for mutually interconnecting said first 
holes (13); 
at least one series of second holes (16) provided 
through said internal surface (10) and being axially 

aligned with said first holes (13) such that the ends of 
the stems (5) of the hinges (1) may be inserted into and 

supported by the second holes (16) simultaneously when said 
stems are inserted through and supported by said first 

holes (13). 
Holder according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said support (7) is constituted by a rectangular sheet (8) 

of pressboard on which at least six creases (9) and/or pre-punched 
folding lines are formed, said sheet (8) being 

folded so as to assume an essentially parallelepipedal 
shape in which at least said internal surface (10) is 

arranged diagonally with respect to said lateral surface 
(11).  

 
Holder according to any one or more of claims 1 and 
2, characterized in that at least two sequences of said 

series of first holes (13) mutually interconnected by said 
series of slots (14) are provided in said lateral surface 

(11). 
Holder according to claim 3, characterized in that 
two sequences of said series of first holes (13) mutually 

interconnected by said series of slots (14) are spaced by a 
third hole (17) suitable to compensate for the different 

spacing of said first holes (13) or for the different 
diameter of the bodies (3) of said hinges (1). 
Holder according to any one or more of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that said first (13) and 

second (16) holes have different diameters. 
Holder according to any one or more of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that said first seats 

(12) form guiding means for the insertion of the threaded 
stem (5) of said hinges (1) and for keeping the body of 

said hinges in the intended prearranged order. 
Holder according to any one or more of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that said second seats 

(15) form means for the temporary snap-action locking of 
the threaded stem (5) of said hinges (1).
