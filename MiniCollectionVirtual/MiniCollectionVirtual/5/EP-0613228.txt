<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to motor close 
circular magnetization cycle formed by revolving 

shaft end casing, which is characterized by a kind of 
field magnetization cycle axially extending and 

formed by two-side end casing (105) and with following 
advantages compared to traditional motors: 


(1) rotor (100) can be exposed to obtain better effect 
of heat radiation; 
(2) it can reduce the overall height of motor to 
make easy for space arrangement; 
(3) it can reduce weight and cost; 
(4) the surface of exposed rotor can directly form 
driving element for application to special field.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to electrical machines comprising: a frame having a pair of
frame end members made of a good magnetic-inductive material; a rotor rotatably
mounted in the frame end members with its axis of rotation lying in the median plane of
the frame; and a pair of field poles constituted by individual iron cores and field windings
around the field poles which serve to apply a field to the rotor, the frame end members
forming a closed magnetic path between the pair of field poles.GB 2118375 discloses a permanent magnetic stepping motor. The motor includes a rotor
comprising a permanent magnet sandwiched between rotor yokes and mounted on a shaft.
A stator surrounds the rotor and is magnetically excited by current through coils. A two
part cover mutually supports the rotor and stator. The rotor shaft is held within cylindrical
flanges of the casing by bearing. The casing is made of a ferro-magnetic material which
entraps magnetic flux around the rotor and stator and thereby reduces leakage flux.EP 0116380 discloses an electric motor having a stator made up of field poles and a rotor
disposed between the poles which rotates with an axis of rotation perpendicular to the
plane of the field poles. A close magnetic path is formed between the field poles.CH 580880 discloses a permanent magnet electric motor in which a double-ended rotor is
supported by two casing end members.The present invention is characterised over the prior art, and in particular over GB
2118375 in that the rotor is an armature, in that the field windings are of a good magnetic-inductive
material, and in that each frame end member includes a cylindrical structure of
a non-inductive material around the armature mounting for preventing the formation of
a magnetic loop along the armature. The present invention has the following advantages over traditional motors:
1. The rotor can be exposed to obtain improved cooling;2. The overall height of the motor is reduced thereby giving a compact arrangement:3. Weight and manufacturing costs are reduced;4. The surface of the exposed rotor can directly form a driving element for
application of a special field.FIG 1 is a diagram showing the construction of a motor according to the invention in
which the frame end members form a closed magnetic path between the field poles; andFIG 2 is a diagram showing a side view of the motor shown in FIG 1.A motor according to the present invention includes a frame having a pair of frame end
members, a rotor which rotates and mounted in the frame end
