<ABSTRACT>
The tube bender (bending machine) has two bending heads (11,12) which are designed symmetrically with respect to one another and which project cantilever-fashion from a machine frame (10). A cross slide (26) which carries the tube-holding device (25) can be moved across the machine frame (10). The tube (17) is subjected to a first bending operation in a first bending head (12) and the tube-holding device (29) is then moved to the second bending head (11), where the second bending operation is carried out. A plurality of bending operations can thus be carried out in succession without having to reclamp the tube.

A dual-head pipe bending machine comprising a machine frame
(10) supporting two cantilever-like bending heads (11,12)

each of which comprises a rotatable bending template (14)
and a pivot arm (15) with a clamping jaw (16) cooperating

with the bending template (14), and comprising a single
pipe holding device (25) arranged on the machine frame

(10), the longitudinal axis of the pipe holding device (25)
transversely passing that plane in which the axes of the

bending templates (14) are located,
characterized in

that the pipe holding device (25) is supported on a transverse
slide (27) being transversely displaceable relative

to the longitudinal axis, and that each bending head (11,
12) comprises a slide rail (19) of its own as abutment for

the pipe section not to be bent, wherein the pipe (17) in
its respective original orientation can be acted on and

held in position by the respective slide rail (19).
The dual-head pipe bending machine according to claim 1,
characterized in that each bending head (11,12) is vertically

displaceable on the machine frame (10) in a controlled
manner.
The dual-head pipe bending machine according to claim 1 or
2, characterized in that the bending heads (11,12) are

displaceable in a longitudinal direction in a controlled
manner.
The dual-head pipe bending machine according to any one of
claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the bending heads 

(11,12) are displaceable in a transverse direction in a
controlled manner.
The dual-head pipe bending machine according to any one of
claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the pipe holding device

(25) is mounted on a longitudinal slide (29) being
displaceable in a longitudinal direction on the transverse

slide (27).
The dual-head pipe bending machine according to any one of
claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the transverse slide

(27) or the longitudinal slide (29) is displaceable in a
vertical direction.
The dual-head pipe bending machine according to any one of
claims 1 to 6, characterized in that the pivot arms (15) of

the bending heads (11,12) face each other in the pipe receiving
positions and are pivotable in opposite senses of

rotation.
