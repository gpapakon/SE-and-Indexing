<ABSTRACT>
The device is a prosthetic cup prosthesis providing a surface for 
articulation of the spherical head of a joint arthroplasty. The 

articulating surface of the cup is the surface of revolution of an arc 
intersecting the cup equatorial plane and its polar axis, having a 

center of curvature translated from the spherical center of the cup, 
rotated about the cup's polar axis.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to prosthetic acetabular cups as used in 
total hip replacement surgery and has special application to a 
prosthetic acetabular cup having a non-spherical interior cavity. Up to the 1950s, hip prostheses in the United States consisted 
mainly of femoral endoprostheses, and a few cups designed to fit over 
the decapitated femoral neck as an articulating surface replacement for 
the necrotic femoral head. In most cases, the acetabulum was left 
untouched in hip replacement. The need to replace affected acetabulums 
forced the evolution of endoprostheses and femoral head replacements, 
and led to the development of metal acetabulum prostheses into which 
metal femoral endoprostheses would be articulated. Designs of the 
McKee-Farrar-type, Ring, and Sbarbaro total hip prostheses to address 
eroded and necrotic acetabulums as well as femoral heads are examples 
of the spectrum of devices that became available. These devices were 
cemented into their respective sites forming a total hip arthroplasty. While the McKee-Farrar, et al., filled the perceived needs at that 
point in time, certain shortcomings of the all-metal arthroplasties 
were becoming apparent. Squeaking noises emanating from the hip in 
poorly lubricated arthroplasties, clicking noises due to the neck of 
the endoprosthesis striking the lip of the metal cup, and a sensation 
on the part of the patient of dragging due to the relatively high 
coefficient of friction between the prosthetic femoral head and 
acetabular cup were the most prevalent comments about these types of 
prostheses. In an effort to overcome the shortcomings of the all-metal 
prosthesis, a British surgeon, Sir John Charnley, developed the 
archetype of low-friction arthroplasties, articulating a stainless 
steel femoral prosthesis in a polymeric acetabular prosthesis. The 
prosthesis's low-friction qualities were easily shown in vitro by 
moving the polymer cup over the metal prosthetic head. Movement of the  
 
head in the polymer cup was smoother and required perceptibly less 
force to initiate motion than the all-metal prosthesis. The reliability of non-self lubricating articulating surfaces 
depends strongly on their ability to form reliable lubricating films on 
their surfaces. In a theoretical analysis of lubrication performance 
in non-polymeric total hip joints ("Analysis of Lubrication Performance 
in Metal-to-Metal Total Hip Joint [sic]," by Herbert S. Cheng and 
Alan Ai), the authors concluded that cup geometry, surface finish and,
