<ABSTRACT>
An optical disk (1) has sector ID areas (2), a disk ID area (3), a table of content area (4), a ROM area (5) and a RAM area (6). The ROM area stores software programs and basic data and is made non-rewritable by employing a physically permanent recording means, such as embossing ditch patterns, whilst the RAM area is left rewritable. In addition, the ROM has an erasing program, which automatically executes an erasing operation on the recording region. Because of the physical impossibility of an erasing operation this does not affect the ROM portion of the optical disk. If the contents of the ROM is illegally copied onto a rewritable disk, however, then the erasing program comes into effect and prevents the copy disk from being used.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an optical disk capable of 
optically recording and reproducing data, and an optical disk 
device adapted to record and reproduce data using the optical 
disk as the recording medium. Programs for performing desired data processing, 
including basic programs, such as, above all, operating 
systems (OS), various programming languages, simplified 
program languages or word processeors, or the basic data 
indispensable for these programs, such as dictionary data, 
pattern data for Chinese characters or parameter data for 
pattern recognition, are occasionally not in need of being 
rewritten in a manner distinct from a variety of general data 
that are to be processed, but rather some form of write 
inhibit processing is desired, in order to prevent 
inadvertent rewriting of the contents by mistaken operation. 
To this end, in a magnetic disk, such as so-called floppy 
disk, the basic program or the basic data are protected by 
specifying the possible presence of write inhibition for each 
file by a software technique. However, the write protection 
implemented by the software technique may be cancelled rather 
easily by the software such that writing on a file specified  
 
for write inhibition may be occasionally performed during, 
for example, the program runaway or on occurrence of software 
errors. Therefore, for more reliable protection, a disk 
having the program and the basic data recorded thereon is 
provided as a so-called program disk separately from the data 
disk and the write inhibit measures by mechanical or hardware 
technique employing so-called protect seal or protect notch 
are frequently applied to the program disk in its entirety. It is noted that, as disclosed for example in the 
Japanese Patent Publication KOKAI No. 100249/1983, there has 
been proposed an optical information recording carrier which 
is provided with signal tracks composed of pits dedicated to 
reproduction for facilitating adjustment of the recording/reproducing 
optical system. Recently, a recording medium having an extremely high 
recording density, such as an opto-magnetic disk, has made 
its debut. With the optical disk having the ultra-high 
recording density, it is not desirable from effective 
utilization of the recording capacity to prepare a disk 
dedicated to a program file to inhibit the writing therein. 
Thus the basic program such as the aforementioned OS is 
formed by tens to hundreds of kilobytes, whereas the basic 
data are usually formed of hundreds of kilobytes, so that,

that said disk is an optical disk, said program is an erasure 
program for executing an erasure of said prescribed region of 

the disk (1) and said signals comprise said erasure program 
along with a software program adapted for handling data 

recorded on the disk (1) and/or along with basic data required for 
executing a software program. 
The optical disk according to claim 1 characterized 
in that said basic data and said erasure program are previously 

recorded on the recording surface as physical shape changes. 
The optical disk according to claim 1 characterized 
in that said basic data and the erasure program are recorded on 

the inner periphery (5) of the disk (1). 
The optical disk according to claim 3 further 
characterized in that an index information (4) associated with 

the disk record contents is recorded inwardly of the inner 
periphery of the disk (1).

reproducing data on and from a disk (1) according to any one of claims 

1 to 4  
 

comprising means for automatically accessing and reading said erasure 
program and 

means for automatically executing an erasure operation of the 
prescribed regions. 
A method of inhibiting duplication of a disk (1) 
suitable for data recording and reproduction, comprising 

recording a program on said disk for attempting to alter 
signals previously recorded at a predetermined non-rewritable 

region of the disk, the method being characterized by said disk 
being an optical disk, said program being an erasure program 

for executing an erasure of said prescribed region of the disk 
and said signals comprising said erasure program along with a 

software program adapted for handling data recorded on the disk 
(1) and/or along with basic data required for executing a software 

program.
