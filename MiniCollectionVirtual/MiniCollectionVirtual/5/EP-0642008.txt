<ABSTRACT>
A driving device for the measuring shaft 9 of a balancing machine having a friction wheel 2 which is driven by an electric motor 1 and can be brought into and out of drive connection with the measuring shaft 9, the electric motor 1 and the friction wheel 2 being designed as one movement unit 8 which is supported so as to be movable about a bearing device provided on the machine frame 3, the bearing device being arranged offset with respect to the rotor axis 23 of the electric motor 1, in such a way that a torque generated about the bearing device if the rotor of the electric motor 1 is accelerated moves the movement unit 8 to produce the drive connection between friction wheel 2 and measuring shaft 9.

Apparatus for driving a measuring spindle (9) of a balancing
machine comprising a friction wheel (2) which is driven by an electric

motor (1) having a rotor and which together with the electric motor (1)
forms a unit fixed to a machine frame (3), wherein the friction wheel (2)

can be brought into and out of driving connection with the measuring
spindle (9) by a torque generated when the rotor of the electric motor

(1) is accelerated, characterised in that the unit comprising the
electric motor (1) and the friction wheel (2) is in the form of a motion

unit (8) which is supported movably about a pivot axis (24) of a mounting
means (4, 5; 6, 7) arranged on the machine frame (3) and which is

arranged in displaced relationship relative to the rotor axis (23) of the
electric motor (1), so that the motion unit (8) is moved towards the

measuring spindle (9) by the torque generated when the rotor of the
electric motor (1) is accelerated to make the driving connection between

the friction wheel (2) and the measuring spindle (9).
Apparatus according to claim 1 characterised in that the motion
unit (8) is mounted on the machine frame (3) in such a way that the

driving connection between the friction wheel (2) and the measuring

spindle (9) is automatically released by termination of the acceleration
of the rotor of the electric motor (1).
Apparatus according to claim 1 or claim 2 characterised in that
the frictional connection is maintained by virtue of a counteracting

moment produced upon the transmission of force at the frictional
connection between the friction wheel (2) and the measuring spindle (9)

or a drive wheel (10) which is non-rotatably connected to the measuring
spindle (9).
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 3 characterised in
that the motion unit (8) bears against an abutment (32) in the

acceleration phase. 
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 4 characterised in
that the motion unit (8) is held in equilibrium in the rest position by a

weight-compensating means.
Apparatus according to claim 5 characterised in that the weight-compensating
means is in the form of a spring (11) supported on the

machine frame (3).
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 6 characterised in
that the motion unit (8) is mounted resiliently relative to the machine

frame (3) in the mounting means (4, 5; 6, 7).
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 7 characterised in
that the mounting means (4, 5; 6, 7) has two mounting locations.
Apparatus according to claim 8 characterised in that the motion
unit (8) is mounted resiliently in at least one mounting location.
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 9 characterised in
that the motion unit (8) is mounted pivotably in the mounting means (4,

5; 6, 7).
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 10 characterised in
that the pivot axis (24) which is formed in the mounting means (4, 5; 6,

7) is disposed parallel to the rotor axis (23).
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 11 characterised in
that the motion unit (8) is guided about a mounting pivot point (21) in

one mounting location (7) and linearly in another mounting location (6).
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 11 characterised in
that the motion unit (8) is guided linearly in both mounting locations

(4, 5). 
Apparatus according to claim 12 or claim 13 characterised in
that the linear guidance of the motion unit (8) is effected substantially

in a plane in which the axis of rotation (25) of the measuring spindle
(9) and the axis of the friction wheel (2) when in the driving position

are disposed.
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 14 characterised in
that the axis of the friction wheel (2) and the rotor axis (23) of the

electric motor (1) coincide.
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 15 characterised in
that the friction wheel (2) is non-rotatably connected to the rotor of

the electric motor (1).
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 16 characterised in
that the motion unit (8) is mounted in the mounting means (4, 5; 6, 7)

with a spring biasing operative in the direction of the driving
connection between the friction wheel (2) and the measuring spindle (9).
