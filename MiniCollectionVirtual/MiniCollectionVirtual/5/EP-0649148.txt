<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to radiation shielding material primarily intended for
shielding sources of high energy shortwave electromagnetic radiation, in particular
shortwave X-rays and gamma rays such as are found in association with nuclear-powered
steam raising installations and the like.In such installations, ancillary equipment and apparatus such as valves, pumps and
pipes of the steam generating circuit, located in areas to which human access may be
required, e.g. for routine maintenance, overhaul and repairs, can become contaminated
with high energy radiation such as gamma radiation (including beta-gamma radiation) and
it is therefore desirable to provide shielding to protect the operatives who have to enter
and work in it.One method of achieving such temporary shielding is by the use of sheets or tiles
of radiation-shielding material which are hung over or wrapped round the equipment from
which operatives are to be protected or which are formed into temporary housings round
the equipment e.g. by hanging sheets from overhead fixings.In many instances, the equipment is in a confined space and/or in a location which
can only be approached with difficulty through tortuous routes and it is therefore
necessary for the tiles or sheets to be flexible so that for example, they can be
manoeuvred round sharp corners or down narrow passages and/or wrapped round
equipment such as pipes.While lead is well known to be an excellent shield against such radiation, it is
unsuitable for such purposes because it is too heavy and insufficiently flexible; moreover
if the sheets become contaminated, they have to be disposed of, which is expensive. 
Thus, attention has focused on elastomeric or rubbery plastics materials filled with
radiation-shielding particles, e.g. of lead. However, it has been found that if sufficient
particles are incorporated to achieve the required shielding, the product is frequently not
strong enough to support its own weight and also tends to tear or split when it is flexed.
On the other hand, if the amount of particles is adjusted so as to obtain a product which is
self supporting and/or has adequate flexibility, its shielding capability is inadequate or is
only adequate if the material is used in a thickness which creates problems due to its bulk
and also restricts the ability of the material to flex. Moreover, where as is generally the
case, the radiation-shielding particles are metallic, placing these materials in contact
against metallic components of the equipment to be shielded is not
