<ABSTRACT>
A wrist brace (2) has a glove (4) which is adapted to extend from a hand region of a wearer to a forearm region. A support member (6) extends longitudinally in a pocket of the glove and provides support for the wrist. Fastening means in the form of a zip (10) allow the brace to be secured to and removed from the wrist of a wearer. The fastening means (10) are arranged to extend along the inside of the arm of a wearer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates primarily to wrist
braces and, in particular, but not exclusively to wrist
braces for rheumatoid arthritics.Wrist braces are worn by rheumatoid arthritics to
restrict movement of the wrist joint and are designed to
support the wrist whilst still allowing the fingers and
thumb the freedom to move. Although the brace
substantially immobilizes the wrist, it is important
that the fingers and thumb are still able to move freely
so that the finger and thumb joints do not stiffen and
the muscles weaken.Wrist braces are not only worn by rheumatoid
arthritics but may also be worn to support the wrist
after injuries such as sprains and strains. Braces are
also worn as orthopaedic supports, for example, after a
wrist which has been broken is removed from a plaster
cast. It has also been found that wrist braces are of
benefit as a remedial aid to those suffering from
repetitive strain injury which may occur, for example,
from over use of a computer terminal. Finally wrist
braces have been found to be of use by sportsmen and
workmen in order to prevent injuries to the wrist
occurring as a result of lifting heavy objects or
weights.One type of wrist brace which is currently widely
available has a glove made of a material stretchable
only in the longitudinal direct of the brace i.e. in the
direction of the length of the arm. A metal support
member is arranged to extend internally of the glove,
from the palm, down the inside of the arm. The glove is
adjusted to the individual wearer's requirements by
adjustable fasteners arranged on the outside of the arm,
i.e. on the side opposite to the support member. The
fasteners usually take the form of a number of parallel
releasable straps of e.g. Velcro (Registered Trade Mark) 
releasable straps of e.g. Velcro (Registered Trade Mark)
which extend between opposed sides of glove material.
In order to put the brace on, the straps are unfastened
so that the hand can be inserted into the glove. The
straps are then adjusted and fastened to accommodate the
individual wearer's requirements.However, the use of such straps has several
disadvantages. The straps require a relatively large
amount of force to be applied by the patient to undo the
straps which is a problem for those patients with
weakened joints and in particular those patients with
rheumatoid arthritis in both hands. This problem is
further exacerbated by the tendency of the straps to
slip so that the straps must be undone and tightened
several times during the day. This repeated exertion
has

<CLAIMS>
A wrist brace (2) comprising a sleeve (4) adapted
to extend from a hand region of a wearer to a forearm

region, the sleeve being made from a material which is
elastic in the circumferential direction, and a pre-formed

support (6) removably positioned in the sleeve,
the support extending longitudinally of the sleeve for

supporting the wrist of a wearer, 
characterised in that

the sleeve (4) is also elastic in the longitudinal
direction and in that the sleeve (4) is provided with a

longitudinally extending fastening means (10) permitting
the brace to be fastened about the wrist of a wearer by

pulling together portions of the sleeve material against
its circumferential elasticity, or permitting the brace

to be removed.
A wrist brace as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised
in that
 the fastening means (10) is a zip fastener.
A wrist brace as claimed in claim 2 
characterised
in that
 the zip fastener (10) has a large, easy to grip,
pull.
A wrist brace as claimed in claim 1, 2 or 3

characterised in that
 the sleeve (4) is in the form of a
glove having a wrist opening (14) at one end, an opening

(12) for the fingers and an opening (15) for the thumb
at the other end, and a longitudinal opening extending

from the wrist opening (14) part way towards the fingers
opening (12), the longitudinal opening being provided

with the fastening means (10).
A wrist brace as claimed in any preceding claim,

characterised in that
 the support (6) is positioned
between the fastening means (10) and the wearer. 
A wrist brace as claimed in claim 5, 
characterised
in that
 the support (6) and fastening means (10) extend
along the inside of the arm of the wearer.
A wrist brace as claimed in claim 6, 
characterised
in that
 the support (6) comprises an elongate portion
(16) and a cupped portion (18) which provides a convex

surface arranged to conform to the shape of a wearer's
palm.
A wrist brace as claimed in claim 7 
characterised
in that
 the elongate portion (16) of the support has a
concave cross section which is arranged to conform to

the insde arm of a wearer.
A wrist brace as claimed in claim 6, 7 or 8,

characterised in that
 the cupped-portion (18) is angled
relative to the elongate portion (16) at an angle in the

range of 30 to 45 degrees.
A wrist brace as claimed in any preceding claim,

characterised in that
 the support (6) is perforated.
A wrist brace as claimed in any preceding claim,

characterised in that
 the support (6) is mounted within
a pocket (8) of the sleeve (4).
A wrist brace as claimed in any preceding claim

characterised in that
 the support (6) is of plastics
material and is sufficiently rigid to support the wrist

whilst having a degree of resiliency.
A wrist brace as claimed in any preceding claim,

characterised in that
 the sleeve (4) has a layer of
additional material to provide additional support of the

wrist.
