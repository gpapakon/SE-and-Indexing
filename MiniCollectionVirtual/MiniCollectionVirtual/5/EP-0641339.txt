<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to novel 7-azaspiro substituted
quinolone carboxylic acids, pharmaceutical compositions
containing such compounds and methods of treatment with such
compounds.Since the introduction of the antibacterial agent
nalidixic acid, 1,4-dihydro-1-ethyl-4-oxo-7-methyl-1,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic
acid, in 1963, a large number of
patents and scientific papers have been published on
antibacterial compounds having a related naphthyridine or
quinoline structure.Representative of the most recent patent publications
on the subject are European Patent Publication 357047, and
Japanese Patent Publication 1056673. European Patent
Publication 357047 refers to quinolines which are 7-substituted
by an azaspiroalkyl group which in turn is
amino-substituted in the azacycloalkyl group. Japanese
Patent Publication 1056673 refers to quinolines which are 7-substituted
by a pyrrolidinyl group which may have a spiro
group attached thereto. The compounds of the invention
instead are amino-substituted in a spiro group attached to
a six-membered nitrogen-containing ring.The invention provides antibacterial compounds having
the formula

wherein R1 is hydrogen, C1-C3 alkyl, benzyl, a
pharmaceutically acceptable cation, or a prodrug group, A is
CH, CF, CCl, COCH3, C-CH=CH2, C-(C1-C3) alkyl, C-CF3, C-CN or
N; Y is C1-C3 alkyl, C1-C2 haloalkyl, cyclopropyl, 
halocyclopropyl, vinyl, 4-halophenyl, 2,4-difluorophenyl,
methoxy or NHCH3; or A and Y together form a group of the
formula

wherein X is O, S, or CH2, n is O or 1, and B is
CH-(C1-C3)alkyl, C=CH2 or CH-CH2F; R2 is hydrogen, C1-C4 alkyl,
C1-C4 alkoxy, amino, halogen or aminomethyl; and R3 is a group
of the formula

wherein R5 is hydrogen, or C1-C3 alkyl, R6 and R7 are each
independently hydrogen, C1-C3 alkyl or halogen, m is 2 or 3,
p is 1 or 2, q is 2 or 3 and p + q is 4, and R6 is located
next to the group -NHR5.Preferred compounds of the invention are those of
formula I wherein R1 is hydrogen or a pharmaceutically
acceptable cation such as sodium, and hydrates thereof.Other preferred compounds are those wherein A is CH or
N, those wherein Y is cyclopropyl or 2,4-difluorophenyl, and
those wherein R2 is hydrogen.Preferred compounds are those wherein R3 is 1-amino-6-azaspiro[2.5]oct-6-yl,
1-amino-5-azaspiro[2.5]oct-5-yl, or
2-amino-7-azaspiro[3.5]non-7-yl.Specific preferred compounds of the invention are:
   7-(1-amino-6-azaspiro[2.5]oct-6-yl)-1-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-quinoline-3-carboxylic
acid, and
