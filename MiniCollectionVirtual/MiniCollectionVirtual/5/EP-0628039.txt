<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel 2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepines and 
pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof, to methods for their 
preparation, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them, and to their 
use in the treatment of certain disorders in the central nervous system, e.g., 
psychosis, pain, depression, sleep disturbances, dyskinesias, Parkinson's 
disease, stroke. In the last decade intensive pharmacological research concerning benzazepines 
has taken place. The pharmacological properties of benzazepines 
depend to a large extent on the substituents. Various substituted benzazepines 
exhibiting neuroleptic, anti-aggressive, anti-Parkinson and vascular 
effects are known. In European Patent No. 0 200 455 (Novo Industri A/S) 2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepines 
having a heterocyclic or an ortho-fused heterocyclic 
ringsystem in the 5-position are described. These compounds are claimed 
to have antipsychotic and antidepressive effects. In European Patent No. 0347672 2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepines 
having phenyl or a fused phenyl group in the 5-position and a nitro group 
in position 8 are described. The benzazepines are stated to be useful as 
neuroleptics in the treatment of various mental disorders, e.g. manic-depressive 
disorders. It has now been found that a group of 5'- or 6'-substituted or 5',6'-disubstituted 
(2,3-dihydrobenzofuran-7-yl) -2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine 
compounds exhibit strong antidopaminergic effect which makes them 
useful in psychopharmaceutical applications. Surprisingly, the compounds of the invention exhibit unexpectedly high oral 
antidopaminergic activity compared to known compounds.  
 According to the present invention there are provided 2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepines 
of the general formula I 
 
wherein R1 is Cl or Br; 
R3 and R4 independently are hydrogen, halogen, CF3, CN, NO2 or NH2 and 
pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof, provided that R3 
and R4 cannot be hydrogen at the same time. Specific compounds of formula (I) are: 
(+) 8-chloro-5-(5-bromo-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran-7-yl)-7-hydroxy-3-methyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine, (+) 8-chloro-5-(2,3-dihydro-5-iodo-benzofuran-7-yl)-7-hydroxy-3-methyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine, (+) 8-chloro-5-(5,6-dichloro-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran-7-yl)-7-hydroxy-3-methyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine, (+) 8-chloro-5-(5-chloro-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran-7-yl)-7-hydroxy-3-methyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine,
