protuberance 21 in a transversely middle zone of the diaper 1

between urethral meatus and anus of a diaper wearer, and the

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a disposable diaper for
absorption and containment of excretion.Most of conventional disposable diapers intends to
rapidly absorb excretion and to contain its reliably by curving
its substantially inner surface so that the inner surface may
be placed against the wearer's crotch region around the urethral
meatus and the anus. However, loose passage, if it is
discharged on the diaper, may flow toward the belly side of the
wearer before absorbed and consequently cling to the wearer's
crotch region particularly around the urethral meatus. Such
situation is often experienced by babies normally discharging
loose passage.Japanese Utility Model Application Disclosure No.
1995-7620 describes a disposable diaper of which the inner
surface is formed with an annular projection adapted to be
placed against the wearer's skin around the anus and a sink for
loose passage is defined inside this annular projection serving
to prevent loose passage from flowing in the undesirable manner
as has been described above. In this way, this known diaper
alleviates a possibility that loose passage might cling to the
wearer's skin on the belly side before loose passage is absorbed 
by the diaper.Loose passage clinging to the wearer's skin around the
urethral meatus as often occurring in the conventional diaper
prior to the Japanese Utility Model Application Disclosure No.
1995-7620 was unsanitary and took much time to wipe off and to
put away it. Such operation of wiping off and putting away was
troublesome particularly when urine and feces were discharged
at once.While the diaper disclosed in the aforesaid Application
can overcome such problem, a restriction is imposed that the
annular projection must be held in close contact with the
wearer's body around the anus during use of the diaper. In
addition, the annular projection is uncomfortably pressed
against the wearer's skin when the wearer lies on his or her
back and, as a result, a feeling of discomfort due to the diaper
put on may be further emphasized.To solve the aforesaid problem, an object of this
invention is to provide a disposable diaper being capable to
be easily put on the wearer and to prevent loose passage from
flowing toward the front side of the wearer by an arrangement
giving the wearer no feeling discomfort. United States Patent US 5,554,142 discloses a diaper
having a barrier wall extending between leg opening cuff,
which barrier wall in use is stretched taught and raised into
a vertical position, but this requires the barrier cuffs to

a liquid-impervious backsheet (2); and
a liquid-absorbent core (4) disposed between said
topsheet and said backsheet,

   said diaper (1) being 
characterised in that
 it has
locally formed on an inner surface (22) thereof a

trapezoidal, semi-spherical or semi-cylindrical protuberance
(21) lying transversely in a middle zone of said diaper

between urethral meatus and anus of the wearer.
A disposable diaper according to Claim 1, wherein said
protuberance (4) is elastically deformable as it comes in

contact with the wearer's skin.

protuberance (21) present a trapezoidal cross-section at

least one of said transverse direction (X-X) and longitudinal
direction (Y-Y).

protuberance (21) presenting said trapezoidal cross-section

has base sides extending in said transverse direction and
longitudinal direction dimensioned to be 10-100 mm and 10-80

mm, respectively, and top sides are dimensioned to be 5-80
% of the dimensions of the corresponding base sides.
