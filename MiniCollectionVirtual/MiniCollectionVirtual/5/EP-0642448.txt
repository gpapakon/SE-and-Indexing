<ABSTRACT>
The object of the invention is to provide an advantageous insert to be put in a container for a drink under pressure in order that, when the container is opened, matter is released from the insert into the drink to modify the nature of that drink. The insert comprises a vessel having a hollow part (3), closed at one end and open at the other, slidably and sealingly engaged within the open end, a plunger part (8) and valve means permitting only under certain relative pressure conditions inside and outside the vessel egress of matter from the vessel or ingress of matter into the vessel.

 DescriptionINSERTS FOR DRINKS CONTAINERSTechnical FieldThe invention concerns inserts to be put in containers for drinks under pressure in order that, when the container is opened, matter is released from the insert into the drink in the container to modify the nature of that drink.Background ArtInserts of a variety of types have been proposed for inclusion in cans of beer under pressure with the object of releasing gas into the beer when the can is opened and thereby to cause the formation of an enhanced 'creamy' head on the beer. The known inserts have not been entirely satisfactory and are of limited applicability.Disclosure of InventionAccording to the invention an insert to be put in a container for a drink under pressure in order that, when the container is opened, matter is released from the insert into the drink in the container to modify the nature of that drink comprises a vessel comprising a hollow part, closed at one end and open at the other and, slidably and sealingly engaged within the open end, a plunger part and valve means permitting only under certain relative pressure conditions inside and outside the vessel egress of matter from the vessel or ingress of matter into the vessel. 

Before the insert is put into a drink container e.g. a can or a bottle, the vessel is filled with suitable matter for the desired effect and the matter should be substantially compressible e.g. a gas or a liquid together with a substantial volume of gas. The gas may be any gas tolerable in the context of the drink, the container and the insert and may, for example, be air, nitrogen or carbon dioxide. Vhen the insert is in its initial condition ready for putting into the container, the gas, whether or not a liquid is also present, may be at zero gauge pressure or at a higher pressure.If the purpose of the insert is only to modify the head of the drink e.g. in the case of beer, the matter in the vessel may be only a gas or a gas together with a liquid not substantially affecting the flavour of the drink. However, if it is desired to modify the flavour of the drink initially in the container, the vessel of the insert may contain a gas and a suitably flavoured liquid: for example, if the drink in the container is tonic water, the vessel of the insert may contain a gas and gin. An example of another alternative is that the vessel of the insert may contain a fruit juice.Inserts according to the invention may be used in relation not only to a variety of alcoholic final drinks but also in relation to a variety of

Claims
430 1. An insert to be put in a container for a drink under pressure in order that, when the container is opened, matter is released from the insert into the drink in the container to modify the nature of that drink, comprising a vessel comprising a hollow part, closed at one end and
435 open at the other and, slidably and sealingly engaged within the open end, a plunger part and valve means permitting only under certain relative pressure conditions inside and outside the vessel egress of matter from the vessel or ingress of matter into the
440 vessel.
2. An insert according to claim 1 in which the valve means comprises an aperture and a distinct closure member displaceable under certain relative pressure
445 conditions inside and outside the vessel of the insert so that it then ceases to close the aperture.
3. An insert according to claim 1 in which the valve means is provided by the vessel having a part which
450 under certain relative pressure conditions inside and outside the vessel of the insert is broken thereby permitting egress of matter in the vessel out of the vessel.
455 4. An insert according to claim 1 in which the valve means comprises an element which under certain relative pressure conditions inside and outside the vessel punctures a wall of the vessel thereby permitting egress of matter in the vessel out of the vessel.
460
5. An insert according to any proceeding claim having external means to retain the insert in a particular position in the container. 


465 6. An insert according to claim 5 in which the external means are flexible wings, fins or spokes.
7. An insert according to claim 5 in which the external means are provided by the insert having a foldable
470 frame, attached to the vessel at or adjacent the closed end of the hollow part and at or adjacent the outer end of the plunger part.
8. An insert according to claim 7 in which the foldable 475 frame is so dimensioned that, when the insert is ready for insertion into the container, the components of the frame fit closely against the exterior of the vessel but, when the plunger part travels further into the hollow part of the vessel, thereby reducing the overall 480 length of the vessel, the frame is caused to fold outwardly and thereby able to bear against the inner side wall of the container to retain the insert in position.
485 9. An insert according to any preceding claim in which at the place or places where matter in the vessel is to be released to the exterior of the vessel there is a narrow channel or channels such that matter passing from the vessel to its exterior emerges as a fine jet or jets.
490
10. An insert according to claim 9 in which at the place or places where matter in the vessel is to be released to the exterior of the vessel there is a socket in which is located a plug, the plug and/or the socket
495 walls having a fine groove or grooves through which matter in the vessel can pass to emerge at the exterior of the vessel as a fine jet or jets. 


 11. An insert according to any preceding claim in which 500 the matter in the insert is a gas.
12. A container containing a drink under pressure and an insert according to any preceding claim.
505 13. A container according to claim 12 in which the drink is beer.
14. A container according to claim 12 in which the matter in the vessel is a flavoured liquid.
510
15. A container according to claiml2 in which the drink is a fruit juice-based or milk-based drink.
