<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for pouring a fluid hardening mass, such as 
concrete, in layers under water is disclosed. The apparatus 

comprises a hopper with a downwardly directed pouring tube (1) 
and a widened pouring tube foot (4). The widened pouring tube 

foot (4) comprises, from the edge of the flowout opening (2) 
of the pouring tube (1), a substantially radially outwardly 

extending bottom plate (3). The bottom plate comprises an 
upright collar (10) on its outer circumference.

 
The bottom plate (3) of the pouring tube foot (4) has a 

stepped configuration, the lowermost part of which forms a 
supporting portion (9) adapted to rest on the bottom (12) and 

the higher part of which constitutes the lift portion (5, 6, 
7) of the pouring tube foot (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus for pouring a fluid
hardening mass, such as concrete, in layers underwater, this
apparatus comprising a hopper with a downwardly directed
pouring tube and a widened pouring tube foot which comprises,
from the edge of the mouth of the pouring tube, a
substantially radially outwardly extending bottom plate which
comprises an upright collar on the outer circumference
thereof.Such an apparatus is disclosed in NL-C-181,939.
The pouring tube foot is of rotation-symmetrical design and is
pressed in upward direction by the concrete already poured
when the height of the concrete column in the pouring tube
exceeds the height corresponding with the hydrostatic
equilibrium of the concrete column in the pouring tube and the
water column between the top of the floor which has been
poured underwater and the water level on the side of the
pouring tube. The lower portion of the telescopic pouring tube
and the pouring tube foot "float" on the concrete. By
measuring the vertical displacement of the pouring tube foot,
the position of the top surface of the poured concrete layer
and/or the thickness thereof can be determined.This known apparatus enables underwater pouring of a floor
whose top surface is located at a particular distance under
the water level, regardless of the configuration of the
bottom. When the top surface of the poured concrete layer has
attained the desired level, the pouring tube is displaced
laterally over a short distance by means of a displacement
device, whereby the pouring tube foot will initially move in
downward direction to be subsequently brought to the desired
level again through the pouring of concrete.The object of the present invention is to provide an
apparatus with which a relatively thin concrete floor of a
constant thickness can be poured while following the
configuration of the bottom underwater. This object is 
achieved according to the invention by providing an apparatus
of the above-described type, wherein the bottom plate of the
pouring tube foot has a stepped configuration, the lowermost
part of which forms a horizontally extending supporting
portion adapted to rest on the bottom and the higher part of
which consitutes the lift portion of the pouring tube foot,
the edge of the supporting portion proximal to the mouth of
the pouring tube being connected to the edge of the lift
portion through a vertical wall.The stepped design of the bottom plate of the pouring
tube foot makes it possible for the apparatus to move itself
over the underwater
