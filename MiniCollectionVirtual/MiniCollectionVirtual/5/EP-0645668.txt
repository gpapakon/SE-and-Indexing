<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a silver halide photographic 
emulsion and a silver halide photographic light-sensitive 
material applied therewith, and more particularly to a silver 
halide photographic emulsion applicable to a silver halide 
photographic light-sensitive material excellent in sensitivity 
and graininess, and to a silver halide photographic light-sensitive 
material applied therewith. With the recent widespread of such a photographic 
apparatus as a camera, photo-taking opportunities have also 
increased with the use of a silver halide photographic light-sensitive 
material. According thereto, there have been increasing demands for 
making sensitivity and image-quality higher.  One of the dominant factors to the high sensitivity and 
high image-quality of a silver halide photographic light-sensitive 
material is a silver halide grain. The research and 
development of a silver halide grain have also been progressed 
so far in the field of the art, with the purpose of making the 
sensitivity and image-quality thereof to be higher. However, there has been a limit to satisfy both of a high 
sensitivity and high image-quality, because the sensitivity 
thereof is liable to be lowered when a silver halide grain is 
made smaller in grain-diameter so as to improve the image-quality, 
as has usually been tried. For trying to make a sensitivity and an image-quality 
more higher, there have studied the techniques for improving 
the ratio of a sensitivity / a grain-diameter per silver 
halide grain. Japanese Patent Publication Open to Public 
Inspection (hereinafter referred to as JP OPI Publication) 
Nos. 58-111935/1983, 58-111936/1983, 58-111937/1983, 58-113927/1983 
and 59-99433/1984 disclose each such a technique 
as mentioned above in which the so-called tabular-shaped 
silver halide grains are used. As the tabular-shaped silver halide grain is compared 
with the so-called normally crystallized silver halide grains 
such as those of an octahedron, an decahedron or a hexahedron, 
the former has such an advantage that the sensitivity thereof 
can be made more higher, because, when the volume of the 
silver halide grain of the former is the same as in the  
 
latter, the surface area of the former can be larger, so that 
many sensitizing dyes can be absorbed on the surface of the 
silver halide grain. Also, JP OPI Publication No. 63-92942/1988 describes a 
technique in which a core having a high silver iodide content 
is arranged to the inside of a tabular-shaped silver halide 
grain; JP OPI Publication
