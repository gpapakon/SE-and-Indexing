<ABSTRACT>
A switchboard (1) of a low-voltage or medium-voltage switching installation has a first equipment unit (5), which is intended for main circuits, and a further equipment unit (7), which is arranged above the first equipment unit (5) and is intended for auxiliary circuits. Any excessive heating of the further equipment unit (7) is avoided by means of an angled air channel (15) through which air is conveyed, by means of a fan (22), from the top (17) of the switchboard (1) to its front (21). The air channel (15), which is formed by additional walls (13, 14), can be designed as a prefabricated assembly (30, 31, 32).

Switchpanel (1) of a switchgear, having at least 
one first device unit (5) provided for main circuits, 

and having at least one further device unit (7) 
provided for auxiliary circuits, with the further 

device unit (7) being separated with respect to the 
first device unit (5) by walls (11, 12), characterised 

in that arranged at a distance from the separating 
walls (11, 12) is a respective additional wall (13, 14) 

for forming an air duct (15). 
Switchpanel according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that the additional walls (13, 14) 

have approximately the area of the separating walls 
(11, 12), and in that the air duct (15) has 

approximately the width of the switchpanel (1). 
Switchpanel according to claim 1 or 2,
 
characterised in that in the case of an arrangement of 

the first device unit (5) beneath the second device 
unit (7), the air duct (15) is constructed so as to be 

substantially angular, screening the underside and the 
rear side of the second device unit (7). 
Switchpanel according to claim 3,
 
characterised in that the air duct (15) has a first 

opening (16), which is placed on the upper side (17) of 
the switchpanel (1), and a further opening (20), which 

is placed on the front side (21) of the switchpanel 
(1). 
Switchpanel according to claim 4,
 
characterised in that arranged in the region of the 

first opening (16) is a fan (22), which conveys the 
cooling air in the direction (23) of the second opening 

(20). 
Switchpanel according to claim 5,
 
characterised in that provided on the upper side (17) 

of the switchpanel (1) is a recess (26) for 
accommodating the fan (22), and in that the first  

 
opening (1
6) of the air duct (15) is arranged joining 
onto the recess (26) and also set back with respect to 

the upper side (17) of the switchpanel (1). 
Switchpanel according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that at least one wall (13) of 

the air duct (15) is provided with cooling ribs (34). 
Switchpanel according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that by connection of the 

walls (11, 12, 13, 14) which delimit it, the air duct 
(15) is constructed as a prefabricated module (30, 31, 

32) which can be mounted in the switchpanel (1). 
Switchpanel according to claim 8,
 
characterised in that a recess (26) which is used to 

accommodate a fan (22) is included in the module (31). 
Switchpanel according to claim 5,
 
characterised in that the opening (37) placed on the 

upper side (36) of the switchpanel (35) corresponds to 
a supply channel (41) which, if appropriate, is common 

to several switchpanels (35) which are installed next 
to each other, and in that a fan (43) is arranged on at 

least one end of the supply channel (41). 
Switchpanel according to claim 10,
 
characterised in that there is arranged at both ends 

(42) of the supply channel (41) a fan (43), and in that 
optionally either one or other of the two fans (43) is 

to be made active by means of a shutter (44) allocated 
to each of the fans (43).
