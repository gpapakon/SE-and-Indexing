<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a dihalopropene compound, and an insecticide/acaricide
containing the dihalopropene compound as an active ingredient. It also
relates to an intermediate compound for use in the production of the dihalopropene
compound.In the Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication Nos. 48-86835/1973 and
49-1526/74, it is disclosed that certain propene compounds can be used as an active
ingredient of insecticides.However, these compounds are not necessarily sufficient as the active
ingredient of insecticides/acaricides in view of insecticidal activity.Under these circumstances, the objection of the present invention is to provide a
compound having an excellent insecticidal/acaricidal activity. As a solution, it has been
found that particular dihalopropene compounds have an excellent insecticidal/acaricidal
activity.That is, the present invention provides a dihalopropene compound of the
formula I:

wherein l is an integer of 1 to 5; m is an integer of 1 to 4; R1 is halogen, cyano, acetamido,
trifluoroacetamido, nitro, C1-C8 alkyl, C1-C3 haloalkyl, C1-C7 alkoxy, C1-C3 
haloalkoxy, C1-C3 alkylthio, C1-C3 haloalkylthio, C3-C6 alkenyloxy, C3-C6 haloalkenyloxy,
C1-C3 hydroxyalkyl, C2-C4 alkenyl, C2-C4 haloalkenyl, C2-C4 alkynyl, C2-C4 haloalkynyl,
C3-C6 alkynyloxy, C3-C6 haloalkynyloxy, C2-C4 alkoxyalkyl, C2-C4 alkylthioalkyl,
C3-C6 cycloalkyl, C5-C6 cycloalkenyl, C3-C6 cycloalkyloxy, C5-C6 cycloalkenyloxy,
phenyl, pyridyloxy, phenoxy or benzyl, the last four of which may be optionally
substituted with halogen, C1-C5 alkyl, C1-C3 alkoxy, C1-C3 haloalkyl or C1-C3 haloalkoxy,
with the proviso that when l is an integer of 2 to 5, R1s are the same or different,
or two adjacent R1s may be combined together at their terminal ends to form trimethylene,
tetramethylene, methylenedioxy, ethylenedioxy or CH=CH-CH=CH; R2 is halogen,
C1-C5 alkyl, C1-C3 haloalkyl, C1-C3 alkoxy, C1-C3 haloalkoxy, C2-C4 alkenyl, C2-C4
haloalkenyl, C2-C4 alkynyl, C2-C4 haloalkynyl, C2-C4 alkoxyalkyl, C2-C4 alkoxyimino,
allyloxyimino, nitro or phenyl which may be optionally substituted with halogen, C1-C5
alkyl or C1-C5 alkoxy, with the proviso that when m is an integer of 2 to 4, R2s are the
same or different, or two adjacent R2s may be combined together at their terminal ends to
form trimethylene or tetramethylene; D is oxygen, NH or sulfur; Xs are the same or
different and are independently chlorine or bromine; Y is oxygen, NR3, S(O)q, C(R4)2,
