<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to biaxially stretched
heat shrinkable multilayer films with an EVOH-based
oxygen barrier core layer, as for example used in food
packaging.Thermoplastic films have been used for many
years in connection with packaging of various articles
including food products such as fresh red meat. The
latter is often in the form of large pieces (primal cuts)
which are placed in bags formed of thermoplastic films
which are evacuated and sealed as for example by heating
the opposite surfaces of the bag at the open mouth end
and pressing the inner surfaces together to form a heat
seal.The resulting food-containing packages are
often shipped from the packing house to supermarkets or
retail butchers where the packages are opened and the
primal cuts divided into smaller pieces for retail
packaging. These food-containing packages must provide
an oxygen-free environment for substantial periods such
as 4-8 weeks, so the film packaging art has provided
multilayer films with a core layer which is an oxygen
barrier material. The most commonly used oxygen barrier
materials are vinylidene chloride copolymers with various 
comonomers such as vinyl chloride (VC-VDC copolymer) or
methyl acrylate (MA-VDC copolymer). Other known oxygen
barrier materials include polyamides and ethylene vinyl
alcohol copolymer (EVOH).In addition to the oxygen barrier function, the
thermoplastic film has several other requirements as for
example resistance to abuse and stress during packaging
and handling, an attractive uniform appearance with no
streaks, and good optical properties so that the valuable
food product such as a fresh red meat primal cut may be
periodically visually inspected to insure that the
package integrity has not been lost. Accordingly, good
optical properties include low haze and high gloss.From a functional standpoint, the thermoplastic
film must provide high abuse resistance because the food-containing
packages are often moved several times in the
shipping-distribution chain and subjected to external
abuse and impact. Also, the inside surface usually must
be heat sealable to itself, and since different heat
sealing apparatus often operate at different
temperatures, the inside surface must be heat sealable
over a wide temperature range.Another physical requirement of suitable
thermoplastic films for packaging oxygen sensitive
products such as fresh red meat, is that the film must be
heat shrinkable in both the machine direction (MD) and
the transverse direction (TD). This is necessary so that
