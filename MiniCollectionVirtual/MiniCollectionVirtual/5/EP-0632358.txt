<ABSTRACT>
A master clock signal, used to.operate the clock devices 
(e.g., flip flops) formed on an integrated circuit chip, 

includes first and second clock paths. The first clock path 
is a linear trunk having laterally extending tributaries. The 

clock trunk is driven, through buffer circuits, at both ends 
with the master clock, and the internal devices coupled to the 

tributaries to receive the clock signal. The second path 
comprises a closed loop formed proximate the periphery of the 

integrated circuit chip. Clock buffer circuitry receives the 
master clock signal and apply that master clock signal to two 

points on the closed loop path. The closed loop path is used 
to communicate the master clock to only the input/output 

devices, i.e., those that receive data and/or informational 
signals from an external source, or those communicate such 

signals to a destination external to the integrated circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed generally to digital 
apparatus, and more particularly to a technique for 
distributing a master clock signal on an integrated circuit 
chip to minimize clock skew. Today's microelectronic industry has seen amazing 
advances in the art of fabricating semiconductor integrated 
circuits, achieving extremely high device counts for 
individual integrated circuit chips. However, notwithstanding 
the very large scale integration capable today, both 
integrated circuit chips are fabricated with the knowledge 
that they will be incorporated into yet a larger design. 
Thus, for example, computing systems are often formed by 
utilizing even very large scale integrated (VLSI) circuit 
chips mounted to circuit boards, and interconnected to one 
another. More often than not such systems are synchronous in the 
sense that they include clocked devices (e.g., flip flops or 
other bi-stable elements) whose state changes will occur, in 
response to an edge of a clock signal. In such synchronous 
systems it is often desirable that the individual (integrated 
circuit) devices or modules provide informational signals 
(e.g., data, control signals, etc.) or receive such 
informational control signals synchronously; that is, that the  
 
signals be present, or presented, in a steady state condition 
relative to an edge of the clock signal. This is sometimes not an altogether easy task, 
particularly for high frequency operation (e.g., in the megahertz 
range) due to the skew (i.e., difference) between a 
transition of a clock signal applied to a device or chip and 
for instance, a state change of an output signal as a result 
of the clock transition. For example, a large number of 
internal (to the device) clock loads (flip-flops) can cause a 
corresponding large on-chip skew and a chip-to-chip skew due 
to delay differences at individual clock loads. (Chip-to-chip 
skew is mainly due to semiconductor process variations and the 
number of clock loads on different chips, assuming the 
temperature and supply voltage variations at the system level 
are negligible.) In order to ensure a proper exchange of data 
signals between individual devices, on-chip as well as chip-to-chip 
skew must be controlled. One solution is to form a phase lock loop (PLL) on each 
integrated circuit chip. The PLL can be structured to operate 
to receive the clock signal to produce therefrom a number of 
synchronous (phase related) clock signals, maintaining a 
strict phase relationship between the clock signals it 
pro
