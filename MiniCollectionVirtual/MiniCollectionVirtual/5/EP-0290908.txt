<CLAIMS>
1. Iron oxide red pigments, characterized in that they 
consist of cluster-like pigment particles. 
2. Iron oxide red pigments as claimed in claim 1, charac­
terized in that the cluster-like pigment particles consist 

of at least five intergrown spherical particles. 
3. Pure-coloured iron oxide red pigments as claimed in 
claim 1 or 2, characterized in that their content of 

foreign metals in the form of As, Pb, Ba is 
<
 5 ppm of 
each. 
4. Pure-coloured iron oxide red pigments as claimed in 

one or more of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that they 
contain a total of 
<
200 ppm Cu, BaSO₄, Zn, Sb, Cr. 
5. A process for the production of the iron oxide red 
pigments claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 4, charac­

terized in that the seed formation of iron oxide yellow (α­
FeOOH) is carried out in the presence of compounds of the 

elements B, Al, Ga, Si, Ge and/or Sn in quantities of 0.05 
to 10% by weight, expressed as 3- or 4-valent oxides and 

based on the theoretically precipitated α-FeOOH seed, the 
pigment-forming step is carried out in the usual way, the 

brine is separated from the yellow sludge formed and the 
iron oxide yellow paste isolated is calcined to the iron 

oxide red pigment and ground. 
6. A process as claimed in claim 5, characterized in that 
the brine is separated by sedimentation. 
7. A process as claimed in claim 5 or 6, characterized in 
that the iron oxide yellow pastes dried or calcined have a 

solids content of at least 50% by weight on introduction 
into the drying or calcining units. 
8. The use of the iron oxide pigments according to one or 
more of claims 1 to 7 for colouring foods. 
9. The use of the iron oxide red pigments according to 
one or more of claims 1 to 7 for pigmenting paint systems, 

dispersions, plastics and building materials.
