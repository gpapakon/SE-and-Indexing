<ABSTRACT>
A novel MgAPSO molecular sieve, containing a critical range of magnesium 
in the sieve framework, which is particularly active for hydrocarbon conversion is 

disclosed. The sieve advantageously is incorporated, along with a platinum-group 
metal, into a catalyst formulation which is useful in conversion of 

hydrocarbons and particularly for isomerization. When utilized in a process for 
isomerizing a non-equilibrium mixture of xylenes containing ethylbenzene, a 

greater yield of para-xylene is obtained compared to prior-art processes.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved molecular sieve and its use for the
conversion of hydrocarbons. More specifically, the invention concerns a
magnesium-containing non-zeolitic molecular sieve which has a narrowly defined
composition and is particularly useful for isomerization.A large variety of molecular sieves have been disclosed in the art as
useful in catalysts for hydrocarbon conversion. The most well known are the
crystalline aluminosilicate zeolites formed from corner-sharing AlO2 and SiO2
tetrahedra. The zeolites generally feature pore openings of uniform dimensions,
significant ion-exchange capacity and the capability of reversibly desorbing an
adsorbed phase which is dispersed throughout the internal voids of the crystal
without displacing any atoms which make up the permanent crystal structure.
Zeolites often are characterized by a critical, usually minimum, silica/alumina
ratio.More recently, a class of useful non-zeolitic molecular sieves
containing framework tetrahedral units (TO2) of aluminum (AlO2), phosphorus
(PO2) and at least one additional element EL (ELO2) has been disclosed. "Non-zeolitic
molecular sieves" include the "ELAPSO" molecular sieves as disclosed in
US-A-4,793,984, "SAPO" molecular sieves of US-A-4,440,871 and crystalline metal
aluminophosphates - MeAPOs where "Me" is at least one of Mg, Mn, Co and Zn -
as disclosed in US-A-4,567,029. Framework As, Be, B, Cr, Fe, Ga, Ge, Li, Ti or V
and binary metal aluminophosphates are disclosed in various species patents.
Particularly relevant to the present invention is US-A-4,758,419
(corresponding to EP-A-0158348),
which discloses
MgAPSO non-zeolitic molecular sieves. Generally the above patents teach a wide
range of framework metal concentrations, e.g., the mole fraction of (magnesium
+ silicon) in '419 may be between 0.02 and 0.98 with a preferable upper limit of
0.35 mole fraction and magnesium concentration of at least 0.01.The use of catalysts containing a zeolitic molecular sieve and
magnesium for isomerization is disclosed in US-A-4,482,773 and US-A-4,861,740. 
The use of a catalyst containing a MgAPSO non-zeolitic molecular sieve in
hydrocarbon conversion including isomerization is disclosed in the
aforementioned US-A-4,758,419. US-A-4,740, 650 teaches xylene isomerization
using a catalyst containing at least one non-zeolitic molecular sieve which may be
MgAPSO. None of these references, however, disclose or suggest the narrow
criticality of the magnesium content of a non-zeolitic molecular sieve which is a
feature of
