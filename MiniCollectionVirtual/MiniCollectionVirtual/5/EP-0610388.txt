<DESCRIPTION>
 STRUCTURAL MODULEBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the Invention: The present invention relates, in general, to structural modules or panels and, more particularly, to structural modules or panels formed of interconnected cells of predetermined shapes.Description of the Art: Various cellular or honeycomb structures have been developed for use in aircraft, housing, shipping containers, trailers and vehicles. Such structures provide a strong, lightweight module or panel which can be formed in many different configurations and shapes for such various applications. These cellular elements have been constructed in various geometric shapes and in planar or stacked arrangements depending upon impact and shear strength requirements as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,906,508 issued in the names of the present Applicants. As described in that patent, the geometric cell designs lend themselves to contour shapes to conform to the requirements of the final product, such as vehicle doors, decks, hoods and other vehicle body parts. Typically, a solid, thin, outer skin panel is joined to one or both sides of the cellular structure. Further, one or both outer skin panels and one or both sides of the inner cellular structure may be contoured depending upon the particular application.It has been found that certain cellular arrangements provide high impact strength in one direction or axis along the structure, but have far less strength in an opposite direction or along an opposite axis. Thus, unless the cellular structure is increased in thickness along the weaker direction or axis, such cellular structures are limited to only certain low impact force applications or applications involving unidirectional forces. 

 Thus, it would be desirable to provide a structural module which overcomes the deficiencies noted in previously devised structural modules or panels. It would also be desirable to provide a structural module which can be easily and uniformly constructed with high impact strength along all axes. It would also be desirable to provide a structural module which can be constructed with a variety of different geometric, cellular configurations for use in various applications. It would also be desirable to provide a structural module whose configuration can be easily modified to provide additional strength and impact force resistance along any axis.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention is a structural module which includes a plurality of integrally joined cells formed as hollow enclosures. Each cell has a

<CLAIMS>
What is Claimed is: l. A structural module comprising: a plurality of integrally joined cells formed as hollow enclosures, each cell formed with a flat top end, an opposed open end and side walls extending between the top and open ends; the flat top ends of the cells being co-planarly arranged in a first plane of predetermined shape; a plurality of flat portions integrally joined to the side walls of the cells adjacent to the open ends of the cells, the flat portions being arranged in a second plane of predetermined shape spaced from the first plane; the top ends of the cells being arranged in parallel rows, with one cell in one of the rows being co-linearly aligned with one cell in an adjacent row at an acute angle with respect to the axis of each row of cells; and an edge of each of the cells being integrally joined to an edge of a cell in an adjacent row.
2. The structural module of Claim 1 further comprising: integrally joined webs extending between the joined edge portions of certain of the side walls of certain cells and extending upward from the joined edge portions toward the flat top ends of the cells.
3. The structural module of Claim 1 wherein: the flat tops are arranged in a first series of rows; and the flat portions are arranged in a second series of rows adjacent and parallel to the first series of rows.
4. The structural module of Claim 1 wherein: the flat tops of the cells are arranged in a first series of rows; and the flat portions are arranged in the first series of rows between adjacent flat tops of the cells. 


 5. The structural module of Claim 1 wherein: certain portions of at least one of the side walls, the flat top ends of the cells, and the flat portions between the cells include cut off portions devoid of material.
6. The structural module of Claim 1 wherein the flat top ends are closed.
7. The structural module of Claim 1 wherein: the cells in one row are linearly offset from the cells in adjacent rows such that the side walls of the cells in adjacent rows are integrally connected together at the edge portions and extend co-linearly in a common plane disposed at an acute angle with respect to the longitudinal axis of the rows of cells.
8. The structural module of Claim 1 wherein the structural module is formed of molded plastic.
9. The structural module of Claim 1 wherein the structural module is formed of a formed metallic material.
10. The structural module of Claim 1 wherein: a second planar arrangement of integrally joined cells is joined adjacent to the plurality of integrally joined cells.
11. The structural module of Claim 10 further comprising: a planar sheet arranged between and joined to the planar, adjacent arrangement of cells.
