<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a semiconductor 
laser capable of emitting, for example, blue to green 
light. In recent years, there is a demand for 
semiconductor lasers capable of emitting light with 
short wavelengths for improving recording densities of 
optical disks or resolutions of laser printers, and 
vigorous studies have been made for realization of such 
lasers. II-VI compound semiconductors are hopeful as 
materials to be used for fabricating such semiconductor 
lasers capable of emitting light with short 
wavelengths. In particular, ZnMgSSe compound 
semiconductors, which are quaternary II-VI compound 
semiconductors, are recognized to be suitable as 
materials of cladding layers and optical waveguide 
layers required to make on a GaAs substrate a 
semiconductor laser for emitting blue to green light in 
the band of wavelengths of 400nm ∼ 500nm (see, for 
example, Electron. Lett. 28 (1992) 1798). As to semiconductor lasers using II-VI 
compound semiconductors, active studies have been made 
to realize oscillation at the room temperature. As a 
result, the present Applicant has succeeded in pulse 
oscillation at the room temperature by a semiconductor 
laser using ZnMgSSe compound semiconductors referred to  
 
above. As to continuous oscillation at the room 
temperature, however, there has been no report either 
with a semiconductor laser using ZnMgSSe compound 
semiconductors mentioned above or with a semiconductor 
laser using II-VI compound semiconductors other than 
ZnMgSSe compound semiconductors. It is therefore an object of the invention to 
provide a semiconductor laser-using a II-VI compound 
semiconductor as the material of cladding layers and 
having the capability of continuous oscillation at high 
temperatures including the room temperature. According to an aspect of the invention, 
there is provided a semiconductor laser comprising: a 
first cladding layer of a first conduction type; an 
active layer stacked on the first cladding layer; and a 
second cladding layer of a second conduction type 
stacked on the active layer, wherein:
 
   the first cladding layer, the active layer 
and the second cladding layer are made of II-VI 
compound semiconductors, and
 
   pulse oscillation occurs with characteristics 
of a threshold current Ith(A), a threshold voltage 
Vth(V) of the diode composed of the first cladding 
layer, the active layer and the second cladding layer,  
 
a differential resistance Rs(Ω) of the diode after the 
rising, a thermal resistance Rt(K/W) and a 
characteristic
