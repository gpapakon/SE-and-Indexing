<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to coatings for substrates and particularly
relates to substantially transparent coatings for transparent substrates such as glass.High visible transmittance, low emissivity coatings upon transparent substrates
such as glass are characterized by their ability to transmit visible light while minimizing
the transmittance of other wavelengths of light, such as light in the infrared spectrum.
This characteristic is particularly useful in applications where it is desirable to minimize
radiative heat transfer without impairing visibility, such as in architectural glass or
automobile windows. For aesthetic reasons, in many such applications it is important to
maintain reflectance relatively consistent throughout the visible spectrum so that the
coating has a "neutral" color, i.e., is essentially colorless.Generally speaking, such high transmittance, low emissivity coatings comprise a
"film stack" having a thin metallic layer or film with high infrared reflectance and low
transmissivity disposed between metal oxide layers. The metallic layer may be virtually
any reflective metal, such as silver, copper or gold, with silver being frequently used.
Metal oxides useful in high transmittance, low emissivity films include oxides of
titanium, hafnium, zirconium, niobium, zinc, bismuth, indium and tin. Prior art systems
have also employed oxides of metal alloys, such as zinc stannate or oxides of indium/tin
alloys.The metal oxide layers of such coatings serve two important functions. First, they
serve to reduce the visible reflection of the film stack to enhance transmittance. The
metal oxides used in these layers should therefore have a relatively high index of
refraction, e.g., on the order of 2.0 or more, in order to achieve this end. Second, they
should serve to protect the reflective metal layer from the environment. The film stack
is frequently isolated from contact with the environment, as by disposing the film stack 
between two spaced panes of glass in a composite window structure. However, when
these products are being assembled, the film stack is frequently subjected to relatively
harsh conditions, such as by handling, shipping or washing of the panes prior to
assembly.A variety of attempts have been made to enhance the ability of the metal oxide
layers to protect the reflective metal layer. For instance, Gillery et al. teach the use of
titanium oxide as a protective overcoat in U.S. patent 4,786,563.
Gillery et al. explain that titanium oxides achieve
the best
