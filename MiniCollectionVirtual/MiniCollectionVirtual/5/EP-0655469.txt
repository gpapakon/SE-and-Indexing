<ABSTRACT>
Vinylamide oligomers having molecular weights between about 280 and 
7,500 are prepared by the cationic polymerization of vinylamides in the 

presence of a Lewis acid at a temperature between -100° and 100°C. The 
resultant vinylamide oligomers are characterized in that they have a proton 

initiating group at one end and an aldehyde equivalent at the other end. 
These vinylamide oligomers can optionally be hydrolyzed under acidic or 

basic conditions to form the corresponding vinylamine oligomers.

<DESCRIPTION>
This is a continuation-in-part of copending U.S. Patent Application 
Serial Number 07/913,563, filed July 14, 1992, the subject matter of which 
is hereby incorporated by reference. The present invention relates to the polymerization of 
vinylformamides to form oligomers which can be hydrolyzed to form the 
corresponding oligomeric vinylamines. Oligomeric materials containing primary amine groups are desirable in 
numerous applications, particularly coatings, adhesives and curatives for 
epoxy, isocyanate, aminoplast and other reactive systems. Preparation of 
low molecular weight or oligomeric primary amine containing polymers has 
previously been impossible even using the desired precursor monomer 
N-vinylformamide. Even with use of large amounts of chain transfer agents 
suitably low molecular weights could not be achieved. Polymerization of N-vinylformamide (NVF) has been widely reported 
under free radical conditions to give high molecular weight homo and 
copolymers. Polymers containing mixtures of primary, secondary and 
tertiary amine groups (e.g., polyethyleneimine) or oxidatively unstable 
ethyleneamines (mainly secondary, with terminal primary amines) have been 
prepared by other routes and used previously. Vinylamine polymers with molecular weights (Mw) from 3,000 to 6.7 
million have been reported. U.S. Patent 4,018,826 and corresponding 
Reissue Re.30,362 disclose the preparation of poly(vinylamine) salts of 
mineral acids by polymerizing vinylacetamide with a free radical 
polymerization catalyst and hydrolyzing the polymer to the desired amine 
salts by contacting the p-vinylacetamide with an aqueous solution of the 
corresponding mineral acid. Poly(vinylamine) product of about 3,000 to 
about 700,000 molecular weight (4000 to about 1,000,000 for the salt 
product) is suggested. U. S. Patent 4,808,683 discloses making high  
 
molecular weight N-vinylformamide copolymer by free radical polymerization. Zurakowska-Orszagh, et al., J. Polym. Sci, Polym Chem Ed., 19, 1981, 
363-369, describes the synthesis of stable complexes of Lewis acids with 
acrylamide monomers. These complexes have monomer/Lewis acid molar ratios 
of 2 to 4, and therefore are basically stoichiometric complexes. These 
complexes are not polymerized, nor do they polymerize spontaneously. 
Zurakowska-Orszagh, Mirowski and Chajewski, J. Polym. Sci, Polym Chem Ed., 
20, 1982, 1775-84 describes the polymerization of acrylamide monomers in 
the presence of zinc halide Lewis acids. These polymerizations are not 
ionic, but
