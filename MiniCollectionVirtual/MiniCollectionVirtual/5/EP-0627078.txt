<ABSTRACT>
Proposed is a sensor for the determination of gases or gas concentrations in gas mixtures, in particular in the emissions from internal-combustion engines. The sensor has an oxygen pump cell and a measurement probe with a sensitive zone. Located between the pump cell and the gas mixture is a diffusion channel in which an oxygen-concentration gradient X02 is established as well as a gradient XCO for the gas whose concentration is to be determined, the two gradients running in opposite directions. The measurement probe is designed in such a way with respect to the pump cell and the diffusion channel that there is an excess of oxygen at the sensitive zone.
