<ABSTRACT>
Heating metal articles by direct surface impingement of an oxy-fuel 
flame without causing damage, or surface melting of the articles being 

heated. Flame contact is cycled to achieve maximum allowable rate of heat 
introduction thereby substantially reducing the time and energy required to 

achieve the final desired piece temperature.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to heating of shaped metals, e.g. 
billets, for subsequent fabrication operations, e.g. forging or rolling. In many metal fabrication operations, e.g. rolling, forging, bending 
and the like, the metals must be heated prior to being subjected to the 
operation. It is well known that metals are deformed more easily at relatively 
high temperatures, permitting significant size reduction during 
fabrication. Conventional heating methods typically employ fossil fuel 
combustion to produce heat which is introduced into a furnace or other 
heating device. Heating of the metal generally takes place by radiation 
from the refractory contained inside the furnace so that the heat is 
transferred to the product. As the metal is being heated to a temperature 
dictated by the subsequent operation, the rate of heat transfer slows 
significantly since the temperature difference between the metal and the 
refractory is generally very small. Long heating times subject the product 
to oxidizing conditions for longer periods resulting in increased scale 
formation. Increased scale formation can lead to surface defects, additional 
unwanted loss in yield, and increased costs for finishing 
operations when the metal is cooled to room temperature. Additionally, in 
conventional heating operations the refractory represents a large thermal 
mass which requires substantial energy input to reach and maintain a 
desired temperature. Thus, conventional heating methods constrain 
operating flexibility, lead to yield losses due to product oxidation, and 
often are the limiting factor in productivity of a particular operation. 
Lastly, conventional heating methods are ill-suited for future heating 
needs of the metals industry as it adopts continuous processes such as 
direct rolling which are aimed at reducing total manufacturing costs for 
basic metal products. In the ever-increasing competitiveness in the global metal markets, 
the U.S. metals producers must improve all facets of their manufacturing  
 
processes and reduce operating costs while improving product quality and 
consistency. Thus producers are seeking ways to lower their current 
operating costs while pursuing new technologies such as increased use of 
continuous metal processing processes. Induction heating possesses the 
technical capabilities for use in a continuous metal producing process. 
However, high capital and operating costs associated with induction heating 
and poor maintenance records have significantly restricted its

A process for rapid heating of a metal shape to a desired temperature 
comprising the steps of: 

   exposing said metal shape to direct impingement by an oxy-fuel 
flame; 

   maintaining said oxy-fuel flame in contact with said metal 
shape until the surface of said shape reaches the maximum temperature 

which is equal to or greater than that to which the metal shape is to 
be heated but below that at which surface damage begins to occur; 

   removing said oxy-fuel flame from contact with said metal shape 
until said surface temperature has decreased by at least 100°F; 

   alternately impinging and removing said oxy-fuel flame onto 
said metal shape in accord with the previous step until said metal is 

heated to the desired temperature where the surface to core temperature 
gradient is within permissible limits for subsequent processing 

of the metal shape. 
A process according to Claim 1 wherein said metal shape is 
positioned to within a maximum of eight inches from a flame end of an 

elongated oxy-fuel burner. 
A process according to Claim 1 wherein said metal shape is 
continuously passed into and out of contact with separate spaced-apart 

oxy-fuel flames. 
A process according to Claim 1 wherein said oxy-fuel flame 
creates a heat flux to the surface of said metal articles varying between 

0.5 million Btu/hr· ft² and 3.0 million Btu/hr· ft². 
A process according to Claim 4 wherein said heat flux is 
between 1.0 million Btu/hr· ft² and 2.0 million Btu/hr· ft². 
A process according to Claim 1 wherein said oxy-fuel flame is 
removed from contact with said metal shape until said surface temperature 

of said metal shape has decreased between 100°F and 500°F. 
A process according to Claim 1 wherein said oxy-fuel flame is 
produced by a burner that is adapted for rapid turn on-turn off. 
A process according to Claim 1 wherein said oxy-fuel flame is 
created by a burner fired at stoichiometric ratio. 
A process according to Claim 8 wherein said oxy-fuel flame is 
created by firing oxygen and natural gas at a ratio of two oxygen to one 

natural gas. 
A method according to Claim 1 wherein said metal shape is 
positioned within between four and eight inches from a flame end of an 

elongated oxy-fuel burner. 
A method according to Claim 1 wherein the oxy-fuel flame is 
created by using a burner of the type shown in U.S. Patent 4,756,685. 
A method according to Claim 11 wherein the burner is fired to 
create a total heat flux to the 
surface of between 0.5 million Btu/hr· ft² 
and 3.0 million Btu/hr· ft².
