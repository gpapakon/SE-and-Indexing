<ABSTRACT>
The invention is directed to superconducting microwave resonator, to holding devices for those resonators, and to their methods of manufacture. The superconducting microwave resonators employ a superconducting film on substrates positioned on a dielectric. The holding devices include a variety of configurations, such as, a spring loaded device. The superconducting microwave resonators have Q values of as high as microwave resonators formed of Nb, but operate at much higher temperature.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to microwave resonators
formed of high temperature superconductor and dielectric
materials as well as to electronic circuits that employ
those microwave resonators.Microwave resonators are known for use in time and
frequency standards, frequency stable elements, as well
as building blocks for passive devices such as filters
and the like. The performance of the microwave
resonator is gauged by its Q-value, expressed as
Q=2π f0 *(Storage energy/Loss power),
where f0 is the resonant frequency of the microwave
resonator. (See Hayt, J. R., "Engineering
Electromagnetics", 1981, p. 472). As shown in Equation
(1), the Q-value of the microwave resonator can be
increased by reducing the loss power associated with
factors such as conductor loss, dielectric loss, and
radiation loss.Low temperature (Tc), such as 4 K, superconducting
microwave resonators which employ a superconducting
cavity made of Nb are known to have Q-values from about
106 to 109. (See V. B. Braginskii, et al: "The
Properties of Superconducting Resonators on Sapphire",
IEEE Trans. on Magn. Vol. 17, No. 1, P955, 1981, as a
reference.) Although low Tc Nb microwave resonators
have high Q-values, they must operate at very low
temperatures (below 9 K). These microwave resonators
require use of curved cavity walls. Curved cavity walls 
of materials which have a high Tc, of for example 77 K,
however, are difficult to produce. On the other hand,
high Q-value microwave resonators formed merely from a
dielectric without an associated conducting medium also
have high Q-values (see D. G. Blair, et al: "High Q
Microwave Properties or a Sapphire Ring Resonator",
J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys., 15, P1651, 1982.) However, the
problems associated with the far reaching evanescent
fields make them very bulky and vulnerable to
microphonic effect, which limits the applications.Curtis, J. A. et al., 1991 IEEE MTT-5 International
Microwave Symposium Digest, Vol. 2, pp. 447-450,
June 10-14, 1991, Boston, MA, U.S. discloses hybrid
dielectric/high temperature superconductor resonators
and filter configurations using these resonators. For
the TE011 mode resonators disclosed the Q-value is about
200,000 at 20 K. Pao, C. et al., 1988 IEEE MTT-S
International Microwave Symposium Digest, Vol. 1,
pp. 457-458, May 25-27, 1988, New York, NY, U.S.
disclose a superconductor-dielectric resonator based on
a sapphire tube loaded with two plates of Y-Ba-Cu oxides
wherein a Q-factor of 105 to 106 may be achieved using a
H01δ or H015 mode. Kogami, Y. et al., 1991 IEEE
