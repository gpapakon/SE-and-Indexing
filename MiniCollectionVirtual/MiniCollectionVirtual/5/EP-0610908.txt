<ABSTRACT>
Assembly for control of the operation of domestic electrical appliances, comprising at least one central control unit (1) called master unit and at least one peripheral control unit (2) called slave unit capable of governing, according to various modes, the operation of the domestic appliances which are linked thereto. According to the invention, the processing device of the slave unit contains the necessary instructions, relative to the operating mode, while the master unit (1) is configured solely to communicate an operating command to the slave unit (2) according to a particular mode of the said slave unit, and possibly parameters related to this mode.

Operating method for a control unit for domestic electrical
appliances comprising at least one central control unit (1)

referred to as the master unit and at least one peripheral
control unit (2) referred to as a slave unit able to govern,

according to different modes, the functioning of the domestic
appliance which are connected thereto, the said control unit

each comprising a processing device (3) including a
microcontroller (4) and a memory (5), a sending and receiving

interface (6) and means (7) of connection to a communication
network (8) such as for example a radio network or the

electrical distribution network, characterised in that, at the
time of installing a slave unit (2), the latter transmits to

the master unit (1) a list of at least one mode for which it is
able to fulfil a function, a literal and a code associated with

each mode, and optionally information relating to the existence
of at least one set value associated respectively with the

functioning of each mode, whilst the master central unit, after
displaying each literal, goes into wait mode for the

programming by the user of an event following which it will
have to communicate to the slave unit an instruction to operate

according to the mode corresponding to the literal, and
optionally parameters associated with this mode, and then, when

the event occurs, the central unit communicates to the slave
unit (2) an instruction comprising the code corresponding to

the said operating mode, and optionally associated parameters;
the said slave unit, on receiving this instruction, controlling

the appliance which is allocated to it in accordance with the
operating instructions contained in its own processing device

and corresponding to the said mode.
