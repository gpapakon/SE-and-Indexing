<ABSTRACT>
In a scroll type compressor, the cylindrical surface 
of the auxiliary shaft 5c is eccentric from the cylindrical 

surface of the main shaft 5b and the cylindrical surface of 
the rotor shaft 5d, in such a manner that the amount of 

eccentricity thereof satisfies the following condition: 
1/10000 
<
 (amount of eccentricity)/(bearing span)
<
 20/10000, 
and the direction of eccentricity ther
eof is in a range of 
from 0° to 40° in the direction of the centrifugal force of 

the upper balance weight 8 with respect to the direction in 
which the crank section 5a receives a gas compression load, 

and the main shaft 5b has an initial angle of relative 
inclination opposite to the angle of inclination which is 

formed by the gas pressure load and the centrifugal load of 
the balance weight. During the operation of the compressor, 

the load deflection angle and the initial deflection angle 
are canceled out by each other, so that the main bearing 3a 

and the main shaft 5b are held in parallel with each other. 
As a result, the input is decreased, and the shaft is 

scarcely worn, and is prevented from seizure.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a scroll compressor for a 
refrigerating operation and an air-conditioning operation. FIG. 14 is a vertical sectional view of a scroll 
compressor disclosed by Unexamined Japanese Utility Model 
Publication Hei-4-84784(U) on which the first part of claims 1 and 2 is based. In FIG. 14, reference numeral 1 
designates a stationary scroll having a spiral section la 
formed in the lower end face, the stationary scroll 1 being 
connected to a frame 3 with bolts; and 2, an orbiting scroll 
having a spiral section 2a formed in the upper end face which 
is equal configuration to the spiral section la of the 
stationary scroll 1, and a hollow boss section 2b extended 
from the lower end surface. An orbiting bearing 2c is formed 
on the inner surface of the hollow boss section 2b. Further in FIG. 14, reference numeral 5 designates a 
crank shaft the upper end portion of which is formed into a 
cylindrical crank section 5a which is eccentric from the 
axis. The cylindrical crank section 5a is rotatably engaged 
with the orbiting bearing 2c. The crank shaft 5 is made up 
of a main shaft 5b and an auxiliary shaft 5c. The 
cylindrical surfaces of the main shaft 5b and the auxiliary 
shaft 5c are rotatably supported by a main bearing 3a formed 
on the frame 3 and an auxiliary bearing 4a formed on a subframe 
4, respectively.  
 The crank shaft 5 further includes a rotor shaft 5d, 
on which a rotor 6 is mounted by shrinkage fitting. The 
rotor 6 and a stator 7 form a motor section. In order to balance the centrifugal force of the 
orbiting scroll 2, an upper balance weight 8 and a lower 
balance weight 9 are mounted on the crank shaft 5. When current is applied to the stator 7, the torque 
is transmitted to the crank shaft 5; that is, the torque is 
transmitted through the crank section 5a to the orbiting 
scroll 2, to cause the latter 2 to perform an orbiting motion 
to vary the volume of the compressing chamber defined by the 
orbiting scroll 2 and the stationary scroll 1. That is, the 
compressor performs a compressing action. The crank shaft 5 is supported by the main bearing 3a 
and the auxiliary bearing 4a which are provided on both sides 
of the rotor 6. The crank shaft 5, in turn, supports a gas 
load applied to the crank section 5a by the compressing 
action, and the centrifugal forces of the upper and lower 
balance weights 8 and 9. (Hereinafter, the centrifugal force 
of the lower balance weight 9 will be disregarded, being 
extremely small). Now, the crank shaft 5 will be described
