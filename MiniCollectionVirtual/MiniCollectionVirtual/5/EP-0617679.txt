<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a means for 
obtaining improved braking distribution in vehicle 
braking systems, whether electronically controlled or 
mechanical. The curve governing the relationship between axle 
braking for a two-axle vehicle is well known but does 
not take into account other sources of braking which 
would cause vehicles to come virtually to rest without 
friction brakes being employed. Such other sources of 
braking are primarily frictional losses in rotating 
parts and, more importantly, engine braking. Many 
heavy vehicles have means of increasing engine braking 
or have some form of retarder, in the form of an 
additional type of endurance brake which acts on the 
driving wheels. In such vehicles in particular, the 
use of combined braking seriously unbalances the 
braking distribution away from the ideal in which 
utilization of adhesion between axles is equal. In 
conventional vehicles, efforts are made to obtain good 
distribution of foundation (friction) braking but the 
additional braking sources generally represent an 
option or an afterthought and are in no way integrated 
into an overall braking system for the vehicle. In a Brake-by-Wire or Electronic Braking System, 
electronic controls are provided in the combined 
braking scheme which, of course, uses electrical 
signalling, in order to make braking distribution near 
to the ideal so as to improve safety in braking. Such 
a system has therefore to include some level of 
integration of the sources of braking. This may be 
the full integration of a blended braking system or  
 
the lesser integration of an interlinked system in 
which the foundation brake controls make suitable 
allowance for other sources of vehicle braking - 
referred to hereinafter as background braking - in 
order to achieve a more ideal braking distribution in 
actuality. It is this latter type of braking system 
which is the subject of the present invention. It is recognised as impossible to measure all the 
sources of background braking because the sources are 
distributed and often quite small and, as such, 
sensors are not available to measure the effects of 
what is often losses and subject to relatively 
significant disturbances during vehicle movement. 
However, it is possible to measure some or the sources 
of background braking directly, such as driveline 
torque. It is also possible to measure the combined 
effect of all the sources of background braking in the 
deceleration which is produced on the vehicle and from 
a study of typical

<CLAIMS>
A method for achieving improvements in 
braking distribution in a multi-axle vehicle having a 

controlled, pedal responsive, foundation braking 
system, wherein allowance is made for one or more 

sources of background braking, such as frictional losses in rotating 
parts and engine braking, 

by establishing through measurement of the resulting deceleration 
effects on the vehicle a total background 

braking force that said background braking 
represents and assigning this 

force in a predetermined ratio, between the 
vehicle axles. 
A system for achieving improvements in 
braking distribution in a multi-axle vehicle having a 

controlled, pedal responsive, foundation braking 
system, comprising means enabling allowance to be made 

for one or more sources of background braking, such as frictional 
losses in rotating parts and engine braking, 

by establishing through measurement of the 
resulting deceleration effects on the vehicle a total background 

braking force that said background 
braking represents and assigning this 

force in a predetermined ratio, between 
the vehicle axles. 
A system as claimed in claim 2, comprising 
means for assessing the total background braking force 

by measurement of vehicle deceleration when the 
vehicle is not in traction and not yet being braked by 

the foundation brakes. 
A system as claimed in claim 3, wherein the 
background deceleration measurement is arranged to be  

 
made at the point where foundation braking is signalled 

but before the resulting brake pressures have caused 
any significant brake forces to be developed. 
A system claimed in claim 4, wherein the 
measurement of background vehicle deceleration is 

arranged to be made just after the first pedal 
movement whenever the foundation brakes are applied 

and stored for use throughout the stop. 
A system as claimed in claim 3 or 4, wherein 
the deceleration assessment is arranged to be made 

from the average of readings taken over a preset time 
period historical to the point at which the brakes are 

applied. 
A system as claimed in claim 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6, 
comprising means for reducing the background braking 

level in a pre-programmed manner as the vehicle speed 
falls. 
A system as claimed in claim 7, comprising 
means for normalising the measured figure for 

background vehicle deceleration to a given preset 
maximum speed for the vehicle and means for reducing 

this stored figure on each step as the vehicle speed 
falls on the basis of a speed fall-off ratio table. 
A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
total background braking force is measured in terms of 

falling background deceleration, which is allocated 
between axles in a pre-programmed ratio and converted 

into background braking pressures which are subtracted 
from each corresponding axle braking pressure 

calculated to meet the driver's braking demand. 
A system as claimed in claim 2, for use in a 
hydraulic braking system of a vehicle having a 

transversely mounted engine and front wheel drive, 
including hydraulic valve means (118) disposed in the  

 
hydraulic circuit (116) leading to the front brakes and 

adapted to respond to reaction of the engine on its 
mountings when the engine is in overrun (deceleration) 

operation so as to reduce the hydraulic pressure 
supplied to the front brakes in dependence upon the 

engine overrun torque.
