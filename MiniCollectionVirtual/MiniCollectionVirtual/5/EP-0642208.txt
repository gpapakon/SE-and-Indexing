<ABSTRACT>
This method is for manufacturing the cage rotor of an induction motor comprising a plurality of secondary 
conductors arranged in a plurality of through holes (16) of a laminated core (14), and a pair of end rings for connecting 

the secondary conductors to each other on both ends of the laminated core (14) in the axial direction. Each of a pair 
of reinforcing members (22) comprises a cylindrical wall (26), an annular multihole wall (28) having a plurality of 

holes (32) and extending radially inwardly from the edge of one end of the cylindrical wall (26), and an annular end 
wall (30) extending from the other edge of the cylindrical wall (26) radially inwardly and approximately in parallel 

with the multihole wall (28). Each of reinforcing members (22) is arranged on both end faces of the laminated core 
(14) in the axial direction, respectively in such a manner that each of them contacts each multihole wall (28) and 

the through holes (16) communicate with the holes (32). In this state, the laminated core (14) and the reinforcing 
members (22) are fixedly supported by a jig (34), and then, arranged in a mold (36). When casting, a molten metal 

is poured into a continuous cavity including the annular spaces in the reinforcing members (22), the holes (32) of the 
multihole wall (28), and the through holes (16) of the laminated core (14) through the central opening (31) of the end 

wall (30) of one reinforcing member (22a) arranged on the pouring gate (58) side. At the same time, the gas in the 
cavity is exhausted through the central opening of the end wall (30) of the other reinforcing member (22b).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
producing a squirrel-cage rotor for an induction motor, 
and more particularly to a method of producing a 
squirrel-cage rotor for a high-speed induction motor, 
which includes reinforcing members for preventing end 
rings made by a casting from being deformed during high-speed 
rotation. Some induction motors, used as, e.g., spindle motors 
for machine tools, have squirrel-cage rotors which 
include secondary conductors and end rings both 
integrally formed with a laminated core by a casting 
process. When the speed of an induction motor having 
such a squirrel-cage rotor must be increased, there is 
the concern that the end rings arranged at the axial ends 
of a laminated core may bend or break due to the 
centrifugal force caused by high-speed rotation. A known 
squirrel-cage rotor adaptable to high-speed rotation 
includes separate reinforcing members formed of high-rigidity 
materials, such as iron or stainless steel, the 
reinforcing members being fixedly disposed on the rotor 
while surrounding the end rings, so as to eliminate the 
deformation of the end rings. Conventional reinforcing members for the end rings 
of a high-speed squirrel-cage rotor are formed as annular 
elements, each of which has a generally L-shaped cross-section 
at a circumferential region and includes a 
cylindrical wall coming into contact with the cylindrical 
radial outer circumferential surface of the end ring and 
an end wall coming into contact with the axial end 
surface of the end ring. The reinforcing member covers 
the outer surface of the end ring, and the end wall  
 
thereof is usually fixed to the axial end surface of the 
end ring by fixing means such as bolts. Therefore, 
deformation of the end ring due to centrifugal force is 
prevented by the cylindrical wall of the reinforcing 
member. In such a construction, however, the cylindrical 
wall is supported through the end wall on the end ring in 
a cantilever manner, which causes the problem that the 
cylindrical wall tends in itself to be bent outward due 
to centrifugal force in response to the increase of the 
diameter of the rotor or the rotation speed thereof, and 
thus fails to support the end ring. The applicant of the present invention provided in 
the International Patent Application No. PCT/JP93/01335 
(co-pending application), as a related art for solving 
the above problems, a squirrel-cage rotor comprising 
reinforcing members, each of which includes a cylindrical 
wall for surrounding a cylindrical
