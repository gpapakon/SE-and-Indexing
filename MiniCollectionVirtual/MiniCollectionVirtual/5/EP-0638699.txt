<ABSTRACT>
The invention proposes a double connector, especially for fillet-connection of two panels consisting of stone, marble or the like, which comprises a sleeve-type connecting piece (1) with two mutually opposite pin parts (2, 3) which engage in bores (13) of the panels (14, 18) to be connected and can each be connected to an anchoring element (4, 5) which can be fixed in the panels. In order, in addition to simple assembly, also to permit a high capacity for absorbing tensile and compressive forces, at least one of the two anchorage elements (4, 5) is a conical bolt (6), of which the bolt part is provided with a collar (9) engaging into a corresponding undercut (15) of the slit pin part (2, 3). By means of the end side of the pin part (2, 3), upon pushing onto the conical bolt (6), an expansion element (7) is braced in the bore (13) of the panel (14, 18).

<CLAIMS>
Double connector, especially for the concealed 
connection of two slabs of stone, marble or the like, 

consisting of a sleeve-like connecting piece with two stud 
parts which lie opposite each other and engage in drilled 

holes in the slabs to be connected, and each of which can 
be connected to an anchoring element that can be fixed in 

the slabs, characterised in that at least one of the two 
anchoring elements (4, 5) is a cone/bolt member (6), the 

bolt part of which is provided with a collar (9) engaging 
in a corresponding undercut (15) of the slotted stud part 

(2, 3), and that, by means of the end face of the stud part 
(2, 3), on being pushed onto the cone/bolt member (6), an 

expansion element (7) is braced in the drilled hole (13) in 
the slab (14, 18). 
Double connector according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that the expansion element (7) is a wave-shaped 

ring which, on the cone (8) of the bolt (6) is pressed into 
an undercut (12) of the drilled hole (13) in the slab. 
Double connector according to Claim 1, characterised 

in that the collar (9) arranged on the cone/bolt 
member (6) has in the pushing direction a run-on chamfer 

(11). 
Double connector according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that one of the two stud parts (2a) has an internal 

thread (19) that can be screwed onto a corresponding 
external thread (20) of the cone/bolt member (6a). 
Double connector according to Claim 4, characterised 
in that the stop collar (17) between the two stud 

parts (2a, 3) is polygonal.
