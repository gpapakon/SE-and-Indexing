<ABSTRACT>
[CONSTITUTION] A battery charger (28) for an electric 

vehicle comprises a built-in heatsink (162) provided 
with an air passage (163), and a built-in battery 

charger cooling fan (71) for producing an air current 
through the air passage (163) of the heatsink (162) to 

cool the heatsink (162). 
[EFFECT] The heatsink need not be provided with fins 

and hence the battery charger can be formed in a 
comparatively small size.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to improvements 
in a cooling system for cooling a battery charger for an 
electric vehicle. The applicant of the present patent 
application proposed a battery charger for an electric 
vehicle previously in Japanese Patent Laid-open (Kokai) 
No. 5-83863, which will hereinafter be referred to as a 
cited reference. As shown in Fig. 5 of the cited 
reference, heat generated by a choke coil 48 and an FET 
49 is absorbed by a heatsink 43, and the heatsink 43 is 
cooled with air blown by an exhaust fan 45 to suppress 
the rise of the temperatures of the choke coil 48 and 
the FET 49. As shown in Fig. 5 of the cited reference, the 
heatsink 43 is provided with fins having a comparatively 
large height. Therefore, a battery charger 40 shown in 
Fig. 4 of the cited reference has a comparatively large 
height and a comparatively large size. When the electric vehicle is a motorcycle, 
only a limited space is available for mounting equipment 
and the battery charger 40 must be formed in a 
comparatively small size.  
 Accordingly, it is an object of the present 
invention to provide battery charger having a 
comparatively small size to be mounted on an electric 
vehicle. With the foregoing object in view, the present 
invention provides a cooling system included in a 
battery charger, comprising a heatsink provided with an 
air passage, and a battery charger cooling fan for 
producing an air current through the air passage of the 
heatsink to cool the heatsink. The heatsink is disposed with one end thereof 
contiguous with an air inlet formed in a battery charger 
case, and the battery charger cooling fan is disposed 
near the other end of the heatsink, 
   or the heatsink is disposed with its longer side 
extended along the direction of width of the body of the 
electric vehicle, and FETs (field-effect transistors) 
are arranged in contact with the outer surface of the 
heatsink. Air discharged by the battery charger cooling 
fan may be discharged outside through a discharge hose 
connected to the battery charger case. The discharge  
 
hose is extended longitudinally of the body of the 
electric vehicle and is concealed from view by a side 
cover. Since the heatsink has a hollow construction 
and need not be provided with fins, the battery charger 
including the cooling system can be formed in a compact 
construction. Air flows through the air inlet, the air 
passage of the heatsink and the battery charger cooling 
fan in that order. Heat generated by the FETs is 
absorbed and
