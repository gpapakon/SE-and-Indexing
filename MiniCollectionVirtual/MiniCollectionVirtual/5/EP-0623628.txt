<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a 14kb cDNA corresponding to the 
complete muscular dystrophy (MD) gene and the polypeptide, 

dystrophin, which corresponds to the MD gene product. The 
invention also relates to antibodies to the dystrophin 

polypeptide which are useful in a variety of methods of 
immunodiagnosis of MD.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of 
U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 890,694 which is 
incorporated herein by reference. The work reported herein was supported by 
grants from the United States government including 
N.I.H. grants HD 18658 and NS23740. The government has 
certain rights in this invention. This invention relates to the detection and 
treatment of hereditary disease, and in particular to 
the detection and diagnosis of Duchenne, Becker and 
Outlier muscular dystrophies (MD) by various methods. Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an 
X-linked recessive genetic disorder which affects about 
1 in 3,300 males. Traits associated with DMD (DMD 
phenotype) are well known and may include elevated 
creatine phosphokinase levels in serum (at least 10x the 
normal level), delayed development of motor function, 
and muscle weakness characterized by the replacement of 
muscle fiber with adipose and fibrose tissue accompanied 
by a marked variation in muscle size. Until recently, 
carrier identification in DMD families generally was 
accomplished by detecting elevated levels of creatine 
phosphokinase in serum. Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) is also an 
X-linked recessive genetic disorder, but occurs at only 
10% of the frequency of DMD. BMD is a more benign form 
of muscular dystrophy which follows a less rapid  
 
clinical course than DMD. Both DMD and BMD are caused 
by mutations in the DMD gene located in the Xp21 region 
of the short arm of the human X chromosome. Outlier muscular dystrophy (OMD) is a mild 
Duchenne/severe Becker disorder. It forms a subgroup 
that comprises approximately 10 percent of individuals 
inflicted with DMD. Restriction fragment length polymorphisms 
(RFLPs) occur when the genomic DNA sequence in a 
population of animals varies such that complete 
digestion with a restriction endonuclease will result in 
a set of restriction fragments of one or more different 
size arrays. The differences are due to the presence or 
absence in the DNA sequence of sites recognized by the 
endonuclease; a sequence in which the site is present 
will be cut by the endonuclease giving one array, and a 
sequence in which the site is not present will fail to 
be cut by the endonuclease, giving another array. It has been shown that RFLPs which are located 
near a gene associated with a hereditary disease can be 
used to determine the likelihood of a particular person 
having a defective gene and thus having the disease.
