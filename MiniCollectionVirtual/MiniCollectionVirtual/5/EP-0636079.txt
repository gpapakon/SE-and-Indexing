<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for collectively filling and emptying a plurality of tanks in a tank car train, particularly a railway train, comprising a common, continuous filling and discharge line (A) along the row of cars with branch pipes to each individual tank. Each branch pipe in the entire train or in a group of cars is connected to the adjacent tanks by a pipeline (D) at the top of the tank adapted for ventilating and topping off the tanks.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method and apparatus for collectively
filling and emptying fluid in a plurality of tanks,
particularly in a railway train. The apparatus enables
filling and emptying by means of a simple hook-up at the
filling terminal or discharge terminal.Railway transport by tank cars is hampered by long periods
at the terminal for filling or discharging. This is because,
until now, it was necessary for each tank to be connected
individually for filling and emptying. Today's systems also
involve considerable shifting of individual cars to and from
the filling and discharge area. To make emptying and filling
stations which are capable of servicing a plurality of cars,
larger installations must be built with safeguards against
leakage over a greater area.Hitherto there has been developed a large-scale American
system (TankTrain) which, by interconnection of a plurality
of tank cars, pumps the fluid from car to car through a
central overlying pipeline. This involves pressurization of
the cars, which requires the use of specially constructed
tanks. Also, the system is such that the train may be filled
and emptied from one end only.US patent no. 3722556 and French patents no. 1005385 and no.
2125657 describe various methods for filling and emptying the
cars. Danish patent no. 119114 and German laid-open patent
application no. 2245594 describe tank cars where the tanks
are connected to a common pipeline for filling and emptying.
The Danish patent has a common pipeline positioned under the
tanks, and each tank is equipped with a ventilation valve.
The ventilation is conducted out into the surrounding
atmosphere, such that any gases emitted from the fluid can
pollute the environment. With this apparatus, as well as the 
one described in the German laid-open publication, each tank
must be filled to the top ("topped off") individually,
resulting in a slower and riskier filling process.In contrast to the technique described in the Danish patent,
according to the present application all of the tanks in the
entire train or in a group of cars are connected to the
adjacent tanks by a pipeline running between the tops of the
tanks, intended for ventilating and topping off the tanks. A
very simple filling and emptying procedure is thereby
attained whereby, above all, large pressure differences
among the tanks are avoided, and the tanks are topped off in
parallel.By using a central underlying filling and discharge line as a
main line, together with an overlying return pipeline, the
main filling can be done

<CLAIMS>
A method for collectively filling a plurality of tanks in a group or row of railway
tanks, where fluid under pressure is supplied to a permanently mounted, common filling and

discharge line (A) having a filling and discharge connection (F) placed at one end of the line
(A) and that said line (A) is connected to each individual tank through a respective valve (C),

where all of a plurality of valves (C) communicating between the line and the tanks are open,
and overflow-valves (E)

on the tanks
are all also open, and where pumping continues until all the tanks are

filled to nearly full level, 
characterised
 in that thereafter all the valves (C) between
the filling and discharge line (A) and the tanks are closed with the exception of the valve (C)

to the tank situated furthest away in relation to the filling and discharge connection (F), and
that the pump pressure in the line (A) is reduced and liquid is pumped into the tank situated

furthest away in relation to the filling and discharge connection (F) until the remaining volume
thereof is filled up and fluid is conducted over a pipeline (D) to the tank situated adjacent

thereto, until the entire row of tanks is topped off, whereafter all the valves (C) are closed,
wherein all the tanks are connected to the adjacent tanks by such a pipeline (D) running

between the tops of the tanks.
A method for collectively filling a plurality of tanks in a group or row of railway
tanks, where fluid under pressure is supplied to a permanently mounted, common filling and

discharge line (A) having a filling and discharge connection (F) placed at one end of the line
(A) and that said line (A) is connected to each individual tank through a respective valve (C),

where all of a plurality of valves (C) communicating between the line and the tanks are open,
and overflow-valves (E) on the tanks are all also open, and where pumping continues until all the tanks are

filled to nearly full level, 
characterised
 in that a first tank closest to the filling and
discharge connection (F) is filled up first due to lowest pressure drop in the filling and

discharge line (A) between the filling and discharge connection (F) and the valve (C) of the first tank, after
which next tanks of the plurality of tanks are filled in sequence both via the valves (C) and via

overflow pipelines (D) until all the tanks are filled up and fluid enters the overflow pipeline
(D) in the one of the tanks situated furthest away from the filling and discharge connection (F),

whereafter all the valves (C) are closed, wherein all the tanks are connected to the adjacent
tanks by such a pipeline (D) running between the tops of the tanks.
A group or row of railway tanks including an apparatus for collectively filling and emptying a plurality of tanks,
comprising a common, continuous filling and discharge line (A) 

permanently mounted along the row of tanks, connected to each individual tank with a
respective one of a plurality of valves (C), 
characterised
 in that the valve (C) is the only valve
in each tank connected to the filling and discharge line (A), and each tank in the row of tanks

is connected to an adjacent one of the tanks by a separate pipeline (D) at the top of the tank, the pipeline
including means for ventilating and topping off the tanks, and in that overflow-valves

(E) placed on each tank for shutting off the pipeline (D)
prior to transport are provided.
A group or row of railway tanks according
to claim 3, 
characterised
 in that the permanently
mounted, common filing and discharge line (A) is placed inside the tanks for maximum

protection in the case of accidents, and the filling and discharge line (A) includes branch pipes
to the lowest level in any of the tanks and the branch pipes are each provided with the respective

shut-off valves (C).
