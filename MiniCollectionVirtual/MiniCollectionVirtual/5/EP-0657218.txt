<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for cutting frozen pieces of meat. According to the invention, provision is made for the said pieces of meat to be cut continuously in a set of rotating cutters into pieces of between 2 to 8 mm with as little heat absorption and emulsification as possible.

<CLAIMS>
Device for cutting lumpy consumable products, in
particular pieces of meat frozen to around -9°C having an

edge length of 250 x 250 x 250 mm, with minimal heat
absorption and a minimal degree of emulsification to a

grain size of 2 to 8 mm (meat granulation), having the
following features:


rotating in a cutter housing (4) are blades (3, 3a),
which are fastened at a clear axial distance from one

another in a non-rotatable but easily exchangeable manner
on the shaft butt (2) of a three-phase a.c. motor (1),

said shaft butt being horizontal or inclined relative to
the horizontal,
the radial distance (a) of the ends of the rotating
blades (3, 3a) from the inner wall of the cutter housing

(4) is around 2 to 4 mm,
each blade (3, 3a) has an axial feed component (13),
at least some blades (3, 3a) take the form of double
blades,
the two wings of the double blades (3, 3a) are provided
at their leading cutting edge (14) with an obliquely

ground section (15) at a grinding angle (α) of
approximately 25 to 30°, the obliquely ground section

(15) being adjoined by a crowned feed surface (16),
the blades (3, 3a) rotate at speeds of between 500 and
3000 rpm,
the cutter housing (4) has in its lowest region a
downwardly open discharge opening (6) for continuously

discharging meat grains under the effect of gravity, 
disposed - viewed in feed direction (12) - downstream of
the discharge opening (6) of the cutter housing (4) is a

blade (3a), which is at an axial distance (b)
corresponding to at least a fraction of the size of the

discharge opening (6) from the upstream blade (3) and has
a feed component (13) directed counter to the feed

direction (12),
installed upstream of the cutter housing (4), viewed in

an axial direction, is a continuously operating feed
device for the meat pieces, which imparts to the meat

pieces a feed component directed towards the plane of
rotation of the first blade (3).
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that the
feed device is a conveyor worm (8).
Device according to claim 2, characterized in that the
conveyor worm (8) rotates at 20 to 200 rpm.
Device according to claim 2 or 3, characterized in that
the direction of rotation of the conveyor worm (8) is

counter to that of the blades (3, 3a).
Device according to one of claims 2 to 4, characterized
in that the bottom edge of the housing (7) of the

conveyor worm (8) is aligned with the bottom edge of the
cutter housing (4).
Device according to one of claims 2 to 5, characterized
in that the diameter (d) of the worm conveyor housing (7)

corresponds approximately to half the cutter housing
diameter (D). (Figure 5)
Device according to one of claims 2 to 6, characterized
in that the housing (7) of the worm conveyor (8) at its

top end has a downward shaft, inlet hopper (10) or the 
like, of which the wall facing the cutter housing (4)

forms with the top wall of the conveyor worm housing (7)
a cutting edge (10a) for effecting coarse preliminary

disintegration of large meat pieces.
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that the
feed device is a conveyor belt.
Device according to one of claims 3 to 8, characterized
in that the drive of the feed device is a three-phase

a.c. motor (9) with an upstream converter for speed
variation.
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that the
feed device is a gravity conveyor which feeds the meat

pieces by means of their own weight via a chute, an inlet
hopper (11) or the like to the set of blades (3, 3a)

rotating in an inclined plane. (Figure 6)
Device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the three-phase a.c. motor forming

the drive for the set of blades (3, 3a) has an upstream
converter for speed variation.
Device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the first portion (4a) of the

cutter housing (4) viewed in feed direction (12) tapers
slightly in diameter (Figure 13).
