<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns composites with at least two layers which consist of different inorganic ceramic compounds and are produced by sintering together different finely particulate inorganic materials disposed in layers. The composites are characterized in that at least two adjacent layers consist of a dense compound largely free of macropores. The layers are bonded together permanently at the compound interface(s) by virtue of the fact that particles of the different materials are sintered together. The composites and the methods of producing them are suitable for use, for example, in the manufacture of gas sensors.

Process for producing composite systems having at
least two layers comprising different inorganic, ceramic

phases, by cosintering of different, finely divided
inorganic materials arranged in layers, characterized in

that on a first layer containing a powder of a first
ceramic material there is applied a second layer which

contains a powder of a second ceramic material, where the
first and the second ceramic material comprise particles

whose mean particle size for the first material is in the
nanometer range and the mean particle size of the second

ceramic material is in the micron range, where at least
the first and second layers are cosintered at a sintering

temperature which is the lowest possible sintering
temperature known per se for the ceramic material having

the particle size in the micron range and where the first
layer contains aluminium oxide and the second layer

contains zirconium dioxide.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the zirconium(IV) oxide is partially or fully

stabilized.
Composite system having at least two layers which
comprise different inorganic, ceramic phases, produced by

cosintering of different, finely divided inorganic
materials arranged in layers, characterized in that at

least two adjacent layers comprise a dense phase which is
largely free of macropores and is obtainable by the

process according to Claim 1 or 2.
