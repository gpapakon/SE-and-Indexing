<ABSTRACT>
A polycrystalline translucent alumina sintered body hav­
ing a high in-line transmission, which is suitable for use as an 

envelope of a high pressure vapour discharge lamp, is pro­
duced by adding to alumina powder having a purity of more 

than 99.8% MgO or a compound forming MgO in an amount 
of 0.01-0.1% by weight calculated as MgO, La₂O₃ or a com­

pound forming La₂O₃ in an amount of 0.001-0.05% by weight 
calculated as La₂O₃, and Y₂O₃ or a compound forming Y₂O₃ 

in an amount of 0.001-0.05% by weight calculated as Y₂O₃, 
thoroughly mixing the resulting mixture, shaping the mixture 

into a desired form and firing the shaped article under vacuum 
or either an atmosphere of hydrogen gas or dissociated 

ammonia gas under an oxygen concentration of 10⁻¹⁵-10⁻²⁵ 
atm.
