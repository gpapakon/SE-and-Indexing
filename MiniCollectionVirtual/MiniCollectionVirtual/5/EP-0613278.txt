<ABSTRACT>
A system that allows a calling party (101) to quickly select a call 
coverage system (106,107,108,110) to be utilized if a call is unanswered. The 

calling party can preselect the call coverage before the call is placed, and the called 
telephone terminal (109) automatically transfers the call to the selected call coverage 

service if the called party does not answer. Alternatively, the called telephone 
terminal transmits back the available call coverage options if the incoming call is not 

answered. In response, the calling telephone terminal displays the available call 
coverage options to the caller, and the caller selects the call coverage option desired. 

The calling telephone terminal then transmits the selected call coverage option to the 
called telephone terminal which transfers the call to the selected call coverage 

service. Also, when the caller wants only to leave a message on a particular call 
coverage system and not talk to the called party, the caller preselects the call 

coverage option and requests to only leave a message for the calling telephone 
terminal (call coverage only). Upon receiving a message defining call coverage 

only, the called telephone terminal immediately transfers the call to the selected call 
coverage system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to telecommunication switching systems
and, in particular, to the control of call coverage options.In present day business telecommunications systems, also referred to as
PBXs, a caller placing an unanswered call is notified that the call is going to call
coverage. However, the caller is given no immediate control over which call
coverage system the call will be transferred. In many systems, if a voice mail
system is attached to the business telecommunication system, the caller is transferred
to the voice mail system, and the voice mail system informs the caller that the caller
can leave a voice mail message or be transferred to a secretary. Certain PBXs also
display on an alphanumeric display when a call is going to coverage but give no
control over which coverage system will be used.An exemplary call coverage system is e.g. disclosed in US-A-4,682,354.The problem with the prior art call coverage methods is the amount of
time required to transfer a call to the voice mail message system, to receive an audio
message from the voice mail system describing the available call coverage options,
to select the desired call coverage option, and to wait for the voice mail system to
make the transfer to the selected call coverage option. More importantly, this
method will become more lengthly as other call coverage services are added in
addition to a secretary and voice mail system. On many occasions, the caller does
not want to talk to the called party but rather wants only to leave a message for the
called party either on the voice mail system or with a secretary. This situation often
occurs when the calling party is communicating a small amount of information and
does not wish to become engaged in a long drawn-out conversation with the called
party.The aforementioned problems are solved and a technical advance is
achieved in the art by an apparatus and method that allow a calling party to quickly
select the call coverage system to be utilized. The calling party can preselect the call
coverage before the call is placed, and the called telephone terminal automatically
transfers the call to the selected call coverage service if the called party does not
answer. Alternatively, the called telephone terminal transmits back the available call
coverage options if the incoming call is not answered. In response, the calling
telephone terminal displays the available call coverage options to the caller, and the
caller selects the call coverage option desired. The calling telephone terminal

<CLAIMS>
A method for designating a call coverage system for a call placed by a
calling telecommunication terminal (101) to a called telecommunication terminal

(109) that has call coverage provided by a plurality of call coverage systems
(106,107,108,110):

   CHARACTERIZED BY

communicating (200,201,209-220,202-207,222-227) an identity of a
selected one of the call coverage systems to the called telecommunication terminal

prior to the call being transferred to any one of the call coverage systems; and
transferring (302-321) the call to the selected one of the call coverage
systems by the called telecommunication terminal in response to the communicated

identity.
The method of claim 1 wherein the step of communicating comprises
the step of including (204,209,224) the identity in a call origination message

transmitted to the called telecommunication terminal to initiate the call.
The method of claim 2 wherein the step of transferring further
comprises the step of initiating (304,319,320,316) immediately the transfer upon

receipt of the call origination message.
The method of claim 1 wherein the step of communicating comprises
the step of including (209) a call coverage capability indication in a call origination

message transmitted to the called telecommunication terminal;

transmitting (312) the identities of the plurality of the call coverage
systems to the calling telecommunication terminal by the called telecommunication

terminal in response to the call coverage capability indication; and
determining (313) the selected identity from the transmitted indentities.
The method of claim 4 wherein the step of communicating further
comprises the step of transmitting (313) the selected identity via a user information

message to the called telecommunication terminal by the calling telecommunication
terminal.
The method of claim 2 or claim 5 wherein the step of transferring
comprises the step of waiting (314) a predefined amount of time to allow a user of 

the called telecommunication terminal an opportunity to answer the call before
transferring the call to the selected one of the call coverage systems.
The method of claim 3 or claim 6 wherein the step of transferring
further comprises the step of transmitting (317) a notification message to the calling

telecommunication terminal by the called telecommunication terminal to inform the
calling telecommunication terminal that the call is being transferred.
