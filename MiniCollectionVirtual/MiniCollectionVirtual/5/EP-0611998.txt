<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a resist material
sensitive to active beam irradiation, particularly a
positive-working radiation-sensitive mixture.The radiation-sensitive mixture is already known by
itself. In particular, a positive-working mixture is
commercially used as a resist material comprising,
besides o-quinonediazide, a binder soluble in an aqueous
alkaline solution, such as poly(4-hydroxystyrene) or
novolac. However, this system is unsatisfactory in the
sensitivity and resolution to radiation, particularly
radiation in a short wavelength region. Novolac is
unsuitable as a binder in a single layer resist material
for deep UV (220-300 nm) because it has a high natural
absorption in an UV-2 region (220-300 nm). On the other
hand, poly(hydroxystyrene) (PHS) has more advantageous
absorption properties in the UV region, a higher heat
stability and a better dry etching resistance.The positive-working radiation-sensitive mixture
for UV-2, wherein PHS is used as a binder having a side
group sensitive to an acid, is known from, for example,
U.S. Patent No. 4,491,628. It is also known that the
sensitivity to radiation of the radiation-sensitive
mixture can be enhanced by the addition of a compound
which releases, upon exposure to radiation, an acid which
has a catalytic action on the secondary reaction.
Examples of the compound capable of forming a strong acid
upon being exposed to radiation include a diazonium salt,
a phosphonium salt, a sulfonium salt, an iodonium salt, a
nitrobenzyl ester, a phenolic methanesulfonate, a diazo
compound, a halogen compound, a bis-sulfonylmethane
compound and a bis-sulfonyldiazomethane compound.A positive-working radiation-sensitive mixture
comprising a PHS copolymer, an acid generating compound
and a N,O-acetal oligomolecule dissolution inhibitor is 
described by H. Roeschert et al. in "Critical Process
Parameters of an acetal-based deep-UV photoresist",
[Advances in Resist Technology and Processing IX, edited
by Anthony E. Novembre, Proc. SPIE 1672, 33-45 (1992)].
The latent acid image of this photosensitive mixture is
unfavorably unstable. The problem of the unstability of
the acid latent image is a fundamental problem of new
resist materials that function on the principle of a
chemical amplification. This problem is fully discussed
in technical literatures, for example, "Airborn chemical
contamination of a chemically amplified resist", S.A.
MacDonald et al., "Advance in Resist Technology and
Processing VIII", edited by Hiroshi Itoh, Proc. SPIE
1466, 2-12 (1991).
