<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor device (JFET, 4, 5) is supported by a semiconductor 
body which comprises a substrate (1), an oxide layer 

(2) and a weakly negatively doped (n) monocrystalline wafer 
(3). Trenches for a dielectrically isolating layer (5) which 

surrounds a component region (4) are etched in the wafer (3). 
A field effect transistor (JFET) in the component region has 

two positively doped (p) wafer-like gate regions (G1), which 
have been diffused in the component region with the aid of a 

first mask. Two heavily negatively (n‚Å∫) doped regions (S2, D2) 
are diffused in the component region with the aid of a second 

mask, these regions forming the source region and the drain 
region of the transistor (JFET). The semiconductor body (1, 2, 

3) is easy to produce and is available commercially, which 
simplifies manufacture of the field effect transistor (JFET). 

Manufacture is also simplified because the configuration of 
both the component region (4) and the parts (G1, S2, D2) of 

the transistor (JFET) are determined by the simple choice of 
masks. The component region (4) is weakly doped (n) and is 

easy to deplete of charge carriers. The electrical field 
strength in the component region (4) is weak, according to the 

RESURF method, and the field effect transistor (JFET) with-stands 
high voltages (V
S
, V
D
, V
G
) without risk of current 
breakthrough. The component region (4) occupies only a 

relatively small area on the substrate (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a dielectrically isolated
semiconductor device which has charge carrier depleted
regions of reduced electrical field strength and which
comprises
a semiconductor body:a component region in the semiconductor body with an upper
surface;a dielectrically isolating layer which delimits the
component region from the semiconductor body;a sunken region in the component region, this sunken region
extending from the upper surface of the component region and
down thereinto;a PN-junction at the delimiting surface of the sunken
region which surface delimits said region from a remaining
part of the component region, said part having an opposite
type of doping to the type of doping of the sunken region; anda semiconductor component in the component region having at
least one electrical connection region in each of the sunken
region and the remaining part of the component region;wherein the regions of reduced electrical field strength
are depleted of charge carriers by electric voltages that are
applied via the electrical connection regions; anda method for manufacturing the semiconductor device.Semiconductor circuits are required to withstand a relatively
high voltage in many different kinds of applications. An
example of one such application is found in the subscriber
line circuits of telephone exchanges. In older Swedish
telephone exchanges, the line to a subscriber was required to 
have an applied voltage of 48 volts, and modern subscriber
line circuits in semiconductor techniques are adapted to these
voltages. Higher voltages are required in other countries, for
instance 68 volts in Germany, while other applications of
semiconductor circuits may use still higher voltages, for
instance voltages of 400 volts or more.One problem with these relatively high voltages is that the
electrical field strength may exceed the critical field
strength of the semiconductor material in certain regions of
a component. This can result in a current breakthrough which
destroys the semiconductor material if the current is not
limited. The same problem of high field strength also occurs
in very small and rapid semiconductor components intended for
calculating or computing circuits. Although these components
are connected to low voltages, in the order of 3 to 5 volts,
the small extensions of the components enable the electrical
field strength to reach high values.In certain applications, the problem of high electric field
strength is pronounced at the surface of a semiconductor
component, as described in
