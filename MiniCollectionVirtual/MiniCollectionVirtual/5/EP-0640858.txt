<ABSTRACT>
A two-source illumination system includes a reflective array of elements 
deflectable to first and second positions in response to a drive voltage, and two sources 

pointed at the array from different angles, so that upon cycling the elements rapidly 
back and forth between the two positions, and alternately cycling the sources between 

on and off conditions synchronously with the cycling of the reflective array, light from 
both sources is (alternately) reflected back along an axis normal to the array. This 

arrangement allows driving the sources at a higher power level, resulting in a higher 
total light output from the system than would be possible with a single source driven 

constantly at a lower power level.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to illumination systems, and more particularly
relates to a two-source illumination system having a high light output.Light emitted from illumination systems can be modulated by an array of
picture elements or pixels whose transmittance or reflectance can be changed in
response to an electrical signal, thus creating a display. The modulating array is
sometimes referred to as a light valve.In light valve projection systems, such as those employing LCD panels as
light valves, the typical acceptance angle needed to provide an adequate level of display
contrast is on the order of plus or minus 15 degrees. In projection systems which are
proposed to employ DMD (digital micromirrored device) panels as light valves, the
acceptance angle is even narrower, for example, on the order of plus or minus 10
degrees. Collecting a high percentage of light from a light source over such a restricted
collection angle has proven to be difficult in practice.Light sources which have the combination of small arcs (on the order of 1
to 2 mm in length), high values of luminous efficacy and/or the ability to be driven at
high power levels would seem to be the best suited for these demanding applications.
However, only two known types of lamps come close to meeting these requirements; a
500 watt xenon arc lamp and a 100 watt high pressure discharge lamp. Both lamps have
a small arc of about 1 mm. However, the xenon lamp has a relatively poor luminous
efficacy of around 25 lumens per watt, while the high pressure lamp, although it has a
somewhat higher luminous efficacy of about 60 lumens per watt, still cannot provide
sufficient output to achieve the required brightness levels in the current projection
systems employing DMD light valves.Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to provide an illumination
system which has a relatively high light output. It is another object of the invention to provide such an illumination system
which is suitable for use with light valve projection systems.It is another object of the invention to provide such a system which has a
relatively high light output within a relatively narrow acceptance angle.In accordance with the invention, a two-source illumination system
includes: a DMD (digital micromirrored device) having a planar array of reflective
deflection elements, the elements deflectable to first and second positions in response to
first and second drive voltages; means for causing the elements to cycle periodically
between the first and second positions; first and
