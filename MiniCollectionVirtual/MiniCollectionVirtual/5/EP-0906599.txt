<ABSTRACT>
A system is provided for optimizing a network plan. The system includes a memory which stores information specifying a network plan, a plurality of constraints, and a plurality of interaction coefficients. Each interaction coefficient corresponds to particular constraint. A processor is coupled to the memory. The processor is operable to determine whether the network plan violates any of the constraints, modify the network plan in order to resolve a violation of any constraint, and update a corresponding interaction coefficient in order to reflect an impact upon the network plan caused by the resolution of a violation.

<DESCRIPTION>
 SYSTEM FOR OPTIMIZING A NETWORK PLAN AND METHOD OF OPERATIONTECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates in general to the field of electronic systems, and more particularly to a system for optimizing a network plan and method of operation.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONPlanning is essential to almost any endeavor. In a network comprising a number of elements, proper planning can optimize the operation of the elements, both on an individual basis and a collective (i.e, network) basis.In the past, the process for deriving a suitable network plan could be painstakingly difficult. In most cases, certain restrictions, limitations, or other constraints on the operation or function of a network had to be taken into account . When a version of a network plan violated one or more of such constraints, that version was generally modified or changed in order to eliminate or resolve the violations. However, if the elements within a network interacted, any resolution taken to remedy the violation of one constraint could cause another constraint to be violated. Because it was difficult to determine how a specific change would impact or effect a version of a network plan, a network plan often had to be modified a great number of times before a suitable version was derived.Furthermore, when a network is operated, "bottlenecks" may arise such that optimized operation is not realized. 

More specifically, a bottleneck can be any part of a network that hinders or impedes other parts of the network. Although it is desirable to identify these bottlenecks, previous systems and techniques were not able to do so in a satisfactory manner.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONIn accordance with the present invention, a system for optimizing a network plan and method of operation are provided that substantially reduce or eliminate problems and disadvantages associated with prior techniques.According to one embodiment of the present invention, a system is provided for optimizing a network plan. The system includes a memory which stores information specifying a network plan, a plurality of constraints, and a plurality of interaction coefficients. Each interaction coefficient corresponds to particular constraint. A processor is coupled to the memory. The processor is operable to determine whether the network plan violates any of the constraints, modify the network plan in order to resolve a violation of any constraint, and update a corresponding interaction coefficient in order to reflect an impact upon the network plan caused by the
