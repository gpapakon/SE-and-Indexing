<ABSTRACT>
Method of producing consolidated or sealed bodies in the soil, in particular in the form of columns or laminations, in which a drill and injecting rod is sunk and is withdrawn again while placing binder suspension, the rod being sunk by the auger drilling method, and excess material being drawn off via the interior of the drill and injecting rod during the withdrawal of the rod and during the placing of the binder suspension.

A method of producing consolidated or sealing members 
in the soil, especially in the form of columns or 

diaphragms, wherein a drilling and injection rod (1) is 
lowered, and lifted while ejecting a binding agent 

suspension,
 
characterised in
 
that the drilling and injection rod (1) is lowered using 

the helical drilling method and that the excess material 
rising in the borehole while lifting the rod (1) and 

ejecting the binding agent suspension is discharged 
through the interior of the rod (1). 
A method according to claim 1,
 
characterised in
 
that while the binding agent suspension is being ejected, 

compressed air is introduced into the interior of the 
rod (1). 
A method according to claim 1 or 2,
 
characterised in
 
that the binding agent suspension is ejected in at least 

one substantially radial cutting jet from the drilling 
and injection rod (1), which cutting jet emerges from 

the drilling and injection rod,preferably surrounded by 
compressed air. 
A method according to claim 1 or 2,
 
characterised in
 
that water is ejected in at least one substantially 

radial cutting jet from the drilling and injection rod  
 

(1), which cutting jet emerges from the drilling and 
injection rod, preferably surrounded by compressed air. 
A method according to claims 2 and 3 or 2 and 4,
 
characterised in
 
that the pressure levels of the compressed air entering 

the interior of the rod (1) and of the compressed air 
emerging outwardly from the rod (1) differ. 
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 5,
 
characterised in
 
that the rod (1) is lifted while rotating, especially 

in the direction opposed to the direction of rotation 
during drilling. 
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 6,
 
characterised in
 
that the rod (1) is lifted in a non-rotating condition. 
A drilling and injection rod (1) for carrying out 
a method according to any one of claims 1 to 7, having 

a double-wall tubular member (2) which comprises a 
central inner chamber (4) and an annular chamber (3), 

which is provided for the purpose of guiding a binding 
agent suspension, and which comprises at least one 

nozzle exit (10 - 13) arranged at the lower end of the 
rod (1) and leading to the environment, to which 

tubular member, on the outside, there is attached at 
least one spiral turn and which tubular memher is 

provided with at least one mantle aperture (6) for 
discharging the excess material rising in the borehole 

when ejecting the binding agent suspension, which 
mantle aperture (6) connects the central inner chamber 

(4) to the environment 
by
 means of a through-channel 
which extends through the two walls of the tubular 

member and which is sealed relative to the annular 
chamber (3).  

 
A rod according to claim 8,
 
characterised in
 
that the annular chamber (3) is divided into at least 

two longitudinal channels (8, 9) for guiding binding 
agent suspension and compressed air and, optionally, a 

longitudinal channel (15) for guiding water and that said 
channels each comprise exit nozzles (10, 11, 16; 12, 13, 

18, 17) provided for binding agent suspension (10, 11, 
16), for compressed air (12, 13, 18) and for water (17) 

and leading outwardly to the environment. 
A rod according to claim 9,
 
characterised in
 
that the exit nozzles (12, 13, 16) for compressed air 

concentrically and annularly surround the exit nozzles 
(10, 11, 16) for a cutting jet consisting of binding 

agent suspension (10, 11) or water (16). 
A rod according to any one of claims 9 or 10,
 
characterised in
 
that at least one exit nozzle (14) for compressed air 

leading to the inner chamber (4) of the tubular member 
(2) is arranged in the rod (1), especially above the at 

least one mantle aperture (6). 
A rod according to claim 11,
 
characterised in
 
that a plurality of exit nozzles for compressed air 

leading to the inner chamber (4) of the tubular member 
(2) are arranged in the rod (1) at different levels 

relative to one another. 
A rod according to any one of claims 9 to 12,
 
characterised in
 
that the exit nozzles (10, 11, 16) for suspension are 

arranged below the at least one mantle aperture (6).  
 
A rod according to any one of claims 9 to 13,
 
characterised in
 
that at least one exit nozzle (17) for a cutting jet, 

especially consisting of water, is arranged above the 
at least one mantle aperture (6). 
A rod according to any one of claims 8 to 14,
 
characterised in
 
that the at least one mantle aperture (6) can be 

covered by a sealing cap which is opened or removed by 
pressurising the inner chamber (4) of the tubular member 

(2). 
A rod according to any one of claims 11 to 15,
 
characterised in
 
that there are provided means for loading the nozzle 

exits (12, 13; 14) for compressed air leading to the 
inner chamber and to the environment with different 

pressure levels, especially longitudinal channels 
separated from one another or one individual longitudinal 

channel with different pressure reducing valves.
