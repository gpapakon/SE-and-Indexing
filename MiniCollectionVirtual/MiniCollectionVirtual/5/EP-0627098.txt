<ABSTRACT>
A method of production of microparticles of a thermoplastic polymer suitable as a toner for electrostatographic processes comprising the steps of melting the material in a continuous non-solvent phase having a boiling point higher than the melting point of the thermoplastic polymer, mixing the thermoplastic polymer in the continuous phase to produce an emulsion, and cooling the emulsion to produce a dispersion of solid microparticles of the thermoplastic polymer in the continuous phase. The thermoplastic polymer may include pigments or dyes to provide coloured toner particles. A surface active agent may be used to control particle size.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the production of microparticles particularly for 
electrostatographic processes. Prior art electrostatographic processes are known, such as photocopying and 
the like in which microscopic particles are attracted to latent images in the 
form of discrete electrostatic charges on the surface of a suitable recording 
member. Such microscopic particles, usually known as toner particles, may 
be applied to the surface to be toned in dry powder form, or as a suspension 
in an insulating liquid, usually a relatively high boiling point aliphatic 
hydrocarbon liquid or the like. Many methods have been proposed for the production of such toners, both 
dry and liquid dispersed. Toner particles in the general sense normally 
contain at least a pigment or dye and a binder, such as a natural or synthetic 
resin or polymeric material. The so-called dry toners may also have admixed 
therewith flow improving agents such as colloidal silica or the like to enhance 
their functionality in the various toner applications in use, and in addition may 
be mixed with so-called carrier particles, usually magnetic, which act to 
transport the toner to the point of application. Such carrier particles are 
selected to bear the correct triboelectric relationship with the toner particles to 
allow correct toning functionality. Normal production methods are many and 
varied, the most common involving hot melt mixing followed by cooling, 
pulverising and grinding to obtain particles of the correct particle size, 
normally 1 to 10 microns mean diameter. Such processes are energy 
inefficient and in addition environmentally unattractive due to dust generation. 
A further problem exists that particles produced by such processes are not 
necessarily spheroidal and hence do not flow well in use. Microencapsulation techniques have also been proposed to produce more or 
less spherical particles, but such processes are also energy inefficient as they 
normally involve spray drying of water slurries of quite low solids content. Liquid dispersed toners can generally be produced using techniques which 
are more energy efficient and with no significant dusting problems. However,  
 
liquid dispersed toners of the prior art normally contain 
other materials in addition to the colouring matter and 
binder resin or polymer. Such materials include 
surfactants, stabilisers, charge modifiers and the like, 
and in many instances the binder resin or polymer is partly 
soluble in the dispersant or carrier liquid. It is the object
