<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method and a device in the 
drying of a paper web (W), wherein, after th
e press 
section (20) of the paper machine, the paper web (W) is 

dried in a number of successive groups (R
1
...R
N
;R
S
) 
with single-wire draw, in which groups the contact-drying 

cylinders (10) are placed in the upper row and the 
reversing suction cylinders (11) or the equivalent suction 

rolls in the lower row or in equivalent diagonal or vertical 
rows. From the side of its lower face, across the 

entire length of the dryer section, the paper web (W) is 
dried by means of contact-drying cylinders (10). The 

paper web (W) is passed as a closed draw from one 
group (R
1
...R
N
; R
S
) with single-wire draw to the next group, 
and the paper web (W) is guided, while it is placed 

on the drying wire (15) at the side of the outside curve, 
by means of the reversing suction cylinders (11) with a 

curve radius D
2
/2, which is chosen in the range of D
2
/2 
≈ 250...1000 mm. The paper web (W) is kept in constant 

contact with the drying wire (15), as it is placed at the 
side of the outside curve, against the effect of centrifugal 

forces by means of a difference in pressure, which difference 
in pressure is preferably extended over the entire 

inner circumference of said reversing suction cylinders 
(11). In addition to the above, or as an alternative, the 

paper web (W) is dried from the side of its upper face on 
a draw (W
1
) or draws of the paper web (W) that is/are 
free from the wire (15) and/or a flow of drying air is 

applied to the upper face of the paper web (W) through 
the drying wire (15) and/or on said draws (W
1
) of the 
paper web (W) that are free from the wire (15).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a method in the drying of a paper
web, in which method, after the press section of
the paper machine, the paper web is dried in a number
of successive groups with single-wire draw, in which
groups the contact-drying cylinders are placed in the
upper row and the reversing suction cylinders or
equivalent suction rolls in the lower row or in
equivalent diagonal or vertical rows, and in which
method the paper web is pressed by means of the drying
wire against the heated faces of the contact-drying
cylinders, and the paper web is passed, in each group
with single-wire draw, on support of the same drying
wire from one contact-drying cylinder onto the next
contact-drying cylinder over the reversing suction
cylinders or equivalent suction rolls, and, when the
paper web is placed at the side of the outside curve
on the drying wire, the web is held on the wire by
means of a difference in pressure against the effect
of centrifugal forces.Further, the invention concerns a dryer section in a
paper machine, which dryer section is composed of a 
number of successive so-called normal groups with single-wire
draw, in which groups the contact-drying cylinders
are placed in the upper row and/or the reversing
suction cylinders are placed in the lower row
and/or in equivalent diagonal and/or vertical rows,
and between which normal groups the paper web to be
dried has closed group-gap draws, and which reversing
suction cylinders have been arranged so that their
outer circumferences are subjected to negative pressure.In the way known from the prior art, in multi-cylinder
dryers of paper machines, twin-wire draw and/or single-wire
draw is/are employed. In twin-wire draw, the
groups of drying cylinders include two wires, which
press the web, one from above and the other one from
below, against the heated cylinder faces. Between the
rows of drying cylinders, which are usually horizontal
rows, the web has free and unsupported draws, which
are susceptible of fluttering, which may cause web
breaks, in particular since the web is still relatively
moist and, therefore, of low strength. This is
why, in recent years, increasing use has been made of
said single-wire draw, in which each group of drying
cylinders has one drying wire only, on whose support
the web runs through the whole group so that the drying
wire presses the web on the drying cylinders
against the heated cylinder faces, whereas, on the reversing
cylinders or rolls between the drying cylinders,
the web remains at the side of the outside
curve.
