<ABSTRACT>
A device for manually whisking liquids or semi-liquids consists of a rod (1), to the end of which are individually attached toroidal coils (2, 3, 4) of stainless steel fixed to the rod (1) by wire loops (5) twisted to tightness. Annular grooves (8) are formed in the rod (1) to provide longitudinal abutments for the coils (2, 3 and 4) and the end (7) of the rod (1) may protrude beyond the coils (2, 3, 4) and be domed to provide a bearing. The head of the device is immersed in the liquid to be treated and is spun by rolling the rod (1) between the palms of the user's hands to rotate the device at high speed to agitate and froth the liquid.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to devices for manually whisking liquids or semi-liquids 
such as, for example, milk, egg whites or salad dressings into a frothy or 
otherwise mixed condition. The use of such devices enables suitable liquids or 
semi-liquids to be completely aerated, such as whipped egg white, partially 
aerated, such as hot milk for cappuccino coffee, or simply well blended or 
homogenised, such as salad dressings. Such whisking devices have been known for many years. Commonly today, 
devices powered by electric motors are common, and manual whisking devices 
are not as much in favour as they were twenty or thirty years ago. One reason 
for this is that manual devices have not been particularly easy to use or to clean. 
Another reason is that devices for single-handed use have not been particularly 
effective, and have required concerted wrist action for a substantial length of 
time to attain a satisfactorily high degree of frothing. A device for double-handed use was proposed in GB706803. It consists of a 
plurality of metal coils fixed to the base of a rotatable shaft, rotation being 
achieved by means of a cog mounted on the upper end of the shaft and driven 
by a crown wheel worked by a handle. Devices of this general kind have been 
common, but they suffer from the following drawbacks. Firstly, they consist of a number of moving and fixed parts which have to be 
manufactured and then assembled. This makes them costly. Secondly, they are 
not particularly easy to operate and can be quite tiring to the hands. Thirdly, 
they have many surfaces which are virtually inaccessible for cleaning and drying 
purposes. Fourthly, their ungainly shape and size makes for inconvenience in 
storage. The invention in particular relates to such devices which comprise an elongate 
rod of wood, plastics, metal or similar material, said rod being of uniform 
circular cross-section over at least a substantial part of its length and the diameter 
of the cross-section being such that the rod can be comfortably spun at high 
rotational speed when held between the palms of a user by counterwise linear 
palm movement, there being fixed to one end of the rod agitating means 
adapted in use to aerate the liquid or semi-liquid by the forwards and backwards 
rotation of the said rod. Such a device is shown in FR934575. However, the agitating means shown in 
the disclosure are not particularly effective, and the integral structure of the 
whisk demands a complicated and therefore expensive manufacturing process. It is an

A device for manually whisking liquids or semi-liquids comprising an 
elongate rod of wood, plastics, metal or similar material, said rod being of 

uniform circular cross-section over at least a substantial part of its length and 
the diameter of the cross-section being such that the rod can be comfortably 

spun at high rotational speed when held between the palms of a user by 
counterwise linear palm movement, there being fixed to one end of the rod 

agitating means adapted in use to aerate a liquid or semi-liquid by the 
forwards and backwards rotation of the said rod CHARACTERISED IN 

THAT the agitating means comprising a plurality of toroidal coils (2, 3, 4) of 
metallic or non-metallic wire adjacent each other along the length of the rod 

and independently fixed to the rod by respective loops of wire (5) passed 
around the part of the coils which abut the rod (1) and twisted to tightness. 
A device according to claim 1. in which annular grooves (8) are provided in 
the rod to receive the said coils (2, 3, 4) to provide abutments against linear 

riding of the coils along the rod. 
A device according to claim 1. or 2. in which the rod (1) is of uniform 
circular cross-section throughout its length. 
A device according to claim 1., 2. or 3. in which the number of toroidal 
coils (2, 3, 4) is three. 
A device according to any of the preceding claims in which the lower end 
(7) of the rod protrudes from the coils so as to bear upon the base of a 

container holding the liquid or semi-liquid. 
A device according to claim 5. in which the said end (7) of the rod is 
domed.
