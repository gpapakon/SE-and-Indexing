<ABSTRACT>
Electrically conductive adhesive compositions and methods for the preparation and use thereof, in which a solder powder, a chemically protected cross-linking agent with fluxing properties and a reactive monomer or polymer are the principal components. Depending upon the intended end use, the compositions comprise three or more of the following: a relatively high melting metal powder; solder powder; the active cross-linking agent which also serves as a fluxing agent; a resin; and a reactive monomer or polymer. The compositions are useful as improved conductive adhesives, such as for attaching electrical components to electrical circuits; the compositions comprising metal powder are ideally suited for creating the conductive paths on printed circuits. The compositions for forming conductive paths may first be applied to a substrate in the desired pattern of an electrical circuit, and then heated to cure it. During heating, the action of the cross-linking agent and optional reactive monomer or polymer within the mixture fluxes the metals, enabling sintering to occur between the metal powder and the solder powder.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to electrically conductive adhesive compositions suitable for a variety of applications, as well as to methods for the preparation and use thereof.In recent years, electronic devices have increasingly employed printed circuits produced using electrically conductive adhesive compositions, commonly known as polymer thick film inks. This method is much more cost-effective and efficient than other known methods of wiring (such as, for example, chemical etching or plating of copper foil). The majority of the electrically conductive adhesive compositions currently in use are in the form of thermosetting or thermoplastic resin pastes with silver or copper powder as the conductor. Unfortunately, the heretofore known electrically conductive adhesive compositions are not comparable to copper foil wiring in terms of conductivity, adhesion and solderability. The metal-filled pastes also suffer from degradation of electrical conductivity with aging after curing, and they respond poorly to temperature and humidity fluctuations. It is speculated that these problems result in large part from the high silver or copper powder loadings required to achieve acceptable electrical conductivity.In order to overcome these shortcomings, it has been suggested to disperse within said metal powder-resin formulations a solder powder having a melting point at or below the vitrification temperature of the resin. The purpose of the solder is to sinter the copper or silver particles together before setting the resin, thus creating solid electrically conductive bridges between them. Such formulations have exhibited somewhat improved electrical conductivity and solderability. Nonetheless, the proposed compositions including solder powder also suffer from significant problems which have prevented their commercial use.One such problem relates to the use of fluxing agents. In general, soldering the metal particles together requires fluxing agents to remove metal oxides and promote wetting of the metal filler by the molten solder. The metal filler typically consists of many small, irregularly-shaped particles. These compositions have a substantial surface area which must be cleaned of naturally-occurring oxides; in particular, the small particles required for creating fine traces on printed circuits have proportionally large surface areas to be de-oxidized. The heretofore known compositions usually call for addition to the compositions of substantial quantities of fluxing or activating agents, such as organic and
