<ABSTRACT>
A vehicle soundproofing device (9) wherein two 
screens (12) of sound-absorbing material are connected 

integral with the frame (2) of the vehicle (1), on 
opposite lateral sides of the vehicle engine (5); the 

screens being fitted integral with respective end 
portions of respective lips (15), the opposite end 

portions of which cooperate in sliding manner with 
respective outer lateral surfaces of a casing (10) of 

sound-absorbing material fitted to the bottom portion of 
the engine (5).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vehicle soundproofing
device, particularly for motor vehicles.In the following description, specific reference is
made, purely by way of example, to a soundproofing
device for industrial vehicles with an internal combustion
engine.For reducing the noise produced by vehicle components
such as the engine and transmission, damping
devices are employed comprising two shells of soundproofing
material defining a chamber in which the components
are housed. One of the shells extends beneath
the vehicle cab and presents one edge connected to the
vehicle frame, while the other normally extends on the
opposite side of the frame to the other shell, and
presents an end edge connected either to the frame or
to the engine block.EP 0 476 286 discloses a soundproofing device
comprising one or more normally separate jackets, one
of which is made of soundproofing material, and so
shaped as to enclose all but specific portions of the
component and, in particular, a bottom end portion of
the engine. Though relatively compact, the noise damping
performance of devices of this type is less than satisfactory.It is an object of the present invention to provide a
vehicle soundproofing device designed to overcome the
aforementioned drawbacks, and which in particular provides
for troublefree, low-cost production, a high degree
of efficiency, and troublefree fitment to the vehicle.According to the present invention, there is provided
a vehicle soundproofing device, for motor vehicles
as defined in claim 1.A non-limiting embodiment of the present invention
will be described by way of example with reference to
the accompanying drawings, in which:
Figure 1 shows a side view, with parts removed for
clarity, of a preferred embodiment of the device
according to the present invention, fitted to an
industrial vehicle;Figure 2 shows a section, with parts removed for
clarity, along line II-II in Figure 1;Figure 3 shows a larger-scale section of a detail in
Figure 2.Number 1 in Figure 1 indicates a vehicle, in the
example shown an industrial vehicle, comprising a
frame 2 with two side members 3, and a cab 4 fitted in
known manner to frame 2 over side members 3. Vehicle
1 is powered by an internal combustion engine 5 supported
in known manner on frame 2, between side
members 3, and comprising a block 6 extending
between side members 3. Engine 5 also comprises an
oil sump 7, and is connected to a transmission (not
shown) housed inside a casing 8 also extending substantially
between side members 3.Vehicle 1 is
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A vehicle soundproofing device (9) for motor vehicles comprising an engine (5) and a
frame (3) supporting the engine (5), the device (9) including a first bottom casing (10)

enclosing a bottom end portion of the engine (5) and screen means (12, 15) connected to
the frame (3), extending on opposite latéral sides of the engine (5), and cooperating with

the outer surfaces of said first casing (10),
characterized in that
 said first bottom casing (10) is made of acoustically insulating
material, said screen means (12, 15) including at least a pair of screens (12) made of

acoustically insulating material, which project downwards from the frame (3) and hâve
respective substantially flat first portions (13) facing said engine (5) on opposite sides

thereof; said screen means (12, 15) further including two respective elastic lips (15) made of
acoustically insulating material and connected to respective said screens (12), said lips

(15) comprising respective first portions (16) which extend on opposite latéral sides of the
engine (5) and cooperate elastically in a sliding manner with said outer surfaces of said

first casing (10). 
A device as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterized in
that
, in use, each said lip (15) is curved with its concavity
facing outwards.
A device as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
in that
 said lips (15) and said screens (12) are made
of sound-absorbing material.
A device as claimed in any one of the foregoing
Claims, 
characterized in that
 it comprises a second
casing (11) of sound-absorbing material enclosing

the bottom end portion of a further casing (8) housing
the transmission of the vehicle (1); the screens

(12) also comprising respective second portions

(14) adjacent to the respective first portions (13)
and extending, in use, on opposite lateral sides of

said further casing (8); and said lips (15) comprising
respective second portions (17) connected integral

with the second portions (14) of the respective
screens (12) and cooperating elastically with the

outer surface of said second casing (11).
