<DESCRIPTION>
The subject of the invention is an aqueous dispersion of 
phospholipid vesicles, a process for its manufacture and its 
use in pharmaceutical or cosmetic preparations. Liposomes are vesicles and can possess structures of very 
different types. Depending on the method of preparation it 
is possible to distinguish unilamellar, oligolamellar, 
multilamellar or fused bodies with a membrane structure and 
a diameter of about 15 to 3500 nm. In generally accepted speech liposomes are prepared from 
natural, semisynthetic or synthetic phospholipids, whereby 
the principal component is usually phosphatidylcholine. 
Other components are typically phosphatidylethanolamine, 
phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidic acid. A distinction is 
made between unsaturated (natural), partially hydrogenated 
and hydrogenated phospholipids according to their fatty acid 
composition. The subject is reviewed in H.P. Fiedler, Lexikon 
der Hilfsstoffe fur Pharmazie, Kosmetik und angrenzende 
Gebiete, Verlag Editio Cantor, Aulendorf 1989, pp 744-746. In their article Lautenschläger et al. have emphasized the 
importance of liposomes from soy phospholipids in cosmetics 
(Seifen-Öle-Fette-Wachse 114 (1988), 531-534), while Skoza 
and Papahadjopoulos have provided a detailed description of  
 
the preparation of specific phospholipid vesicles (Ann. Rev. 
Biophys. Bioeng. 1980, 9, 467-476). However, the present invention is not suggested even by a 
combination of the above mentioned publications. In a manner similar to biological cells liposomes can take 
up water-soluble substances in the internal vesicular 
volumes and amphiphilic and lipophilic substances in the 
membranes (loaded liposomes). Experience has shown that 
loading of the membranes is of more interest for the application 
of liposomes in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals than 
loading of the internal vesicular volume, since in the 
former case the loaded substance remains largely associated 
with the membranes when the liposomes are mixed with other 
components of the formulation. In the case or water-soluble 
substances which are located in the internal volumes of the 
liposomes it must be expected that even the addition of 
water will bring about losses - particularly in the case of 
low molecular weight substances. The liposomes available until now have significant disadvantages 
in spite of the properties mentioned above: 
1. On account of the high purity materials usually employed 
- primarily highly refined phosphatidylcholines - and the 
complicated method of preparation
