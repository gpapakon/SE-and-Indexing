<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to imidazole ethers 
and thioethers having A II antagonist activity, the 
processes for the preparation thereof, pharmaceutical 
compositions containing them and the use thereof as 
therapeutical agents. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is a 
proteolytic chain which plays a paramount role in the 
control of blood pressure and is apparently involved in 
the onset and the maintainement of some cardiovascular 
disorders, such as hypertension and cardiac 
decompensation. The octapeptide hormon angiotensin II (A II), the 
final product from RAS, mainly forms in the blood 
following to the degradation of angiotensin I, carried 
out by the ACE enzyme, which is located in endothelium 
of blood vessels, lungs, kidney and many other organs. 
Such an hormon exerts a strong vasoconstricting action 
on arteries, due to its interaction with specific 
receptors located on the cell membranes. One of the possible ways to control RAS is the A 
II antagonism at the receptor level. Some peptide 
analogues of A II (for example saralasin, sarmesin) are 
known to competitively block the interactions of said 
hormon, however the use thereof, both experimentally 
and clinically, is restricted by a partial agonist 
activity and by the lack of activity by the oral route. Recently, a number of derivatives having a not-peptide 
structure were described to have II antagonist 
activity.  
 Examples of these compounds are reported in EP 
253,310, EP 324,377, EP 424,317, EP 419,048, EP 
446,062, EP 403,159, EP 427,463, EP 434,249 and in 
papers by J.V.Duncia et al., J.Med.Chem. 33, 1312, 
(1990), 33, 1330 (1990), 34, 2525 (1991); J.Weinstock 
et al., J.Med.Chem. 34, 1514 (1991); A.P.Thomas et al., 
J.Med.Chem., 35, 877 (1992); D.Middlemiss et al., 
Bioorg.Med.Chem.Lett. 1, 711 (1991). The present invention relates to novel imidazole 
derivatives having an aryl(heteroaryl)oxy (thio) alkyl 
or aryl (heteroaryl) alkoxy (alkylthio) alkyl moiety at 
the 5-position. These novel compounds have A II antagonist 
properties and therefore they can be used in various 
cardiovascular disorders, such as hypertension, acute 
and chronic cardiac decompensations, intraocular 
hypertension, and in some renal diseases. The compounds of the invention have general 
formula (I): 
 
wherein: 
E is O or S; R is C1-C5 straight, branched or cyclic alkyl or C2-C5 
alkenyl; X can be H, F, Cl, Br, I, CF3; n is an integer 1 to 4;  
 m is an integer 0 to 4; A is selected from phenyl, thiophene, furan and pyridine ring and B is
