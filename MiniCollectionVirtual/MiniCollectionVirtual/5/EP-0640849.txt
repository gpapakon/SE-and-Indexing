<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an antireflection or
reflection optical film and a method for forming the
same, and to an optical device having such an optical
film.In recent years, optical telecommunication systems
using optical fibres have been made longer in distance,
greater in capacity, and faster in speed, and light has
been used for signal transmission between integrated
circuits. Thus, information transmission technologies
using lightwaves have developed remarkably.In order to make further progress in these
technologies, it is necessary to develop a precisely
made high-output and stable light source, a means for
precisely controlling light, a transmission path which
loses less light, an optical transducer which loses
less light, and so on. A means for precisely
controlling light includes the use of various optical
films in an optical transmission path, an optical
transducer, and the like, and the use of antireflection
film, a reflection film, and the like for composing the
resonator of a semiconductor laser (a laser diode).An antireflection film formed on the optical
output end face of a semiconductor laser must have a
reflectivity of 0.01% or less. In the ordinary
technical field of lens coating, a multi-layered
dielectric film comprising 15 layers is used to attain
this reflectivity.Such a multi-layered dielectric film cannot be
used in a semiconductor laser as it is, because the
material of which the film is made and the method for
forming the film are factors which are involved in
determining the life time of the semiconductor laser.
Since, in a semiconductor laser, there are restrictions
on the material of the antireflection film or on the
method for forming the film, a material or method must
be selected on the basis of experimental facts. Also, 
considering the difference in coefficient of thermal
expansion between the film and the semiconductor laser,
it is desirable to have an antireflection film with as
small a number of layers as possible.The smallest number of layers for obtaining
reflectivity useful for the purpose of an
antireflection film is "2". For example, an
antireflection film of two-layered structure comprising
respective optical films of high and low refractive
indexes is derived from computing an optical
propagation constant of a semiconductor laser of 1.55
µm wavelength, in which the optical film of high
refractive index has a refractive index of 2.44 and a
thickness of 145 µm (1450 Å), and the optical film of
low refractive index has a refractive index of 1.37 and
a thickness
