<ABSTRACT>
In a cassette (1) for holding a magnetic tape (2) into the cassette (1), 
which cassette comprises an elongate pressure-member support (58) for supporting a 

pressure member (56) and an elongate tape-guide-element support (69) for supporting 
two tape guide elements (67, 68), two abutment parts (63, 64) are arranged at the 

location of side portions (59, 60 and 70, 71) of the pressure-member support (58) and 
the tape-guide-element support (69) and take up the forces exerted by the side portions 

(59, 60 and 70, 71) when the magnetic head cooperates with the pressure member (56) 
and the tape-guide elements (67, 68). The pressure-member support (58) has at least one 

opening (85, 86) in each of the two areas (83, 84) of its side portions (59, 60) which 
face the abutment parts (63, 64), and the abutment parts (63, 64) and/or the tape-guide-element 

support (69) have projections (89, 90) at parts (87, 88) of the side portions 
(70, 71) which face the abutment parts (63, 64) projecting towards the facing part of 

said two parts (63, 64, 87, 88), which projections are arranged to correspond to the 
openings (85, 86) in the pressure-member support (58).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a cassette for holding a magnetic tape which can 
be guided inside the cassette along a side wall thereof which has a access opening 
through which at least one magnetic head can be brought into scanning contact with the 
magnetic tape by insertion of said magnetic head into the cassette, which cassette 
comprises a pad-like pressure member adapted to press a magnetic tape against the 
inserted magnetic head, which pressure member is movable transversely of the side wall 
and is secured to a central portion of a substantially elongate blade-spring-like pressure-member 
support which is arranged to extend substantially parallel to the side wall with 
the access opening and has side portions situated adjacent the central portion, and two 
tape-guide elements adapted to guide a magnetic tape past the inserted magnetic head, 
which tape-guide elements are movable substantially transversely of the side wall and 
are arranged substantially mirror-symmetrically relative to the pressure member on a 
substantially elongate blade-spring-like tape-guide-element support which is arranged to 
extend substantially parallel to the side wall and substantially between the pressure-member 
support and the side wall, and which has side portions which are also situated 
adjacent its central portion, and two abutment parts which are arranged in the area of 
the side portions of the pressure-member support and the tape-guide-element support at 
their sides which are remote from the side wall, and which, with a magnetic head 
inserted, take up the forces exerted by the side portions of the pressure-member support 
and the tape-guide-element support. The invention also relates to a pressure-member support for a cassette as 
defined in the first paragraph, which support is of a substantially elongate and blade-spring-like 
construction and comprises a central portion for securing a pressure member 
and, situated adjacent the central portion, two side portions adapted to cooperate with 
abutment parts of the cassette. The invention further relates to a tape-guide-member support for a cassette 
as defined in the first paragraph, which support is of a substantially elongate and blade 
spring-like construction and comprises a central portion and two side portions which are  
 
situated adjacent the central portion and which are adapted to cooperate with abutment 
parts of a cassette, which support carries two tape-guide elements adapted to guide a 
magnetic tape. A cassette of the type defined in the first
