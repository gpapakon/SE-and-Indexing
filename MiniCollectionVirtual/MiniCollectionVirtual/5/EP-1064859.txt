<ABSTRACT>
A cap (1) has a plurality of main elements
(5), the side of which are connected to one

another, each of the main elements (5) being in
the shape of an approximately isosceles triangle

having no top portion or an approximately
sector having no top portion. A top element (6)

in the shape of a dome or a flat and poygon or
the like is connected to said main elements

(5). The cap (1) has two recesses or concave
portions formed at lower portions of the main

elements (5). At least one adhesive tape (8) is
attached on the outer surface of a lower

portion of at least one of the main elements
(5), an adhesive surface being formed on the

outer surface of the adhesive tape (8).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cap and
more particularly to a cap having a good feeling
of use when it puts on one's head.A conventional hemispherical cap 1 is
formed by sewing or adhering to one another
side edges 3 of a plurality of main elements 2
in the shape of an isosceles triangle or a
sector, as shown in FIG. 1.However, as shown in FIG. 2, the side edges
3 of the main elements 2 sewed or adhered to one
another make tucks on the inner surface of the
cap 1 and ends of said tucks are concentrated
to an inner top portion 4 and risen therefrom.
Accordingly, the risen tucks at the inner top
portion 4 makes a disparate feeling of use when
the cap puts on one's head.Especially, in case that the cap is used as
an inner cap for a helmet or the like, the
feeling of use thereof gets worse, because the
risen portion of the tucks contacts strongly
the center of the one's head. It is, therefore, an object of the present
invention to overcome the above disadvantage.It is also an object of the present
invention to provide a new and improved cap
comprising a plurality of main elements, the
side of which are connected to one another, each
of said main elements being in the shape of
an approximately isosceles triangle having no
top portion or an approximately sector having
no top portion.Another object of the present invention
is to provide a cap comprising a plurality of
main elements, the sides of which are connected
to one another, each of said main elements being
in the shape of an approximately isosceles
triangle having no top portion, or an
approximately sector having no top portion, and
a top element connected to said main elements.Said top element is in the shape of a dome
or a flat and rectangular.The cap has two recesses or concave
portions formed at lower portions of said main
elements.At least one adhesive tape is attached on 
the outer surface of a lower portion of at
least one of said main elements, an adhesive
surface being formed on the outer surface of
said adhesive tape.In the present invention, at least a
portion of said top element and said main
elements is made from a mesh.The cap of the present invention, further
comprises a brim formed on the front of the
lower portion of said main elements.The cap of the present invention further
comprises an awning formed on the back side of
the lower portion of said main elements.The above and other objects as well as
advantageous features of the invention will
become apparent from a consideration of the
following description of the preferred
embodiment
