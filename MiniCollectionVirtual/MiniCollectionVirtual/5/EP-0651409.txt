<ABSTRACT>
The spring drive for an electrical switching device has a connection shaft to which a connection spring is eccentrically coupled and on which the large wheel (16) is seated in a rotationally fixed manner. A small wheel (20), which is driven in order to stress the connection spring, interacts with said large wheel (16). The tooth system (52) of the large wheel (16) has a gap (54) in order to decouple the pair of wheels (18) when the connection spring is stressed. In order to connect the switching device, the large wheel (16) is driven in the rotation direction (D), as a result of which the tooth system (52) engages with the small wheel (20) again. In order to prevent the wheels locking up when they engage in one another, the teeth (60) of the small wheel (20) are designed in such a manner that the edges (56,58) abut against one another, radially on the outside, at a common edge (62).

A spring drive for a switching apparatus, 
especially a power circuit breaker for medium voltage and 

high voltage, having a switch-on spring (28) which is 
coupled eccentrically to a rotatably mounted switch-on 

shaft (14) for driving the switch-on shaft (14) in a 
rotation direction (N) to switch-on the switching 

apparatus (12), having a large wheel (16) which is 
connected to the switch-on shaft (14), and a small wheel 

(20) which interacts with said large wheel and can be 
driven by means of a drive device (22), in order to 

stress the switch-on spring (28) by rotation of the 
switch-on shaft (14) in the rotation direction (N) from 

an initial position (50), in which the switch-on spring 
(28) is at least partially relieved of stress, via a 

deadpoint position (44) in which the switch-on spring 
(28) is stressed, having a latching device (34) which 

supports the switch-on shaft (14) in a supported position 
(48) which follows the deadpoint position (44) in the 

rotation direction (N) and releases the switch-on shaft 
(14) to switch-on the switching apparatus, having a gap 

(54) in a tooth system (52) on the large wheel (16) at a 
point which is arranged adjacent to the small wheel (20) 

when the switch-on shaft (14) is supported on the 
latching device (34), and having means for preventing 

mutual blocking of a wheel pair (18) after release of the 
switch-on shaft (14) by the latching device (34), wherein 

flanks (56, 58) of teeth (60) on the small wheel (20) 
abut against one another radially on an outer side at a 

common edge (62) and the teeth (60) have an involute 
shape on the flank (56) which is loaded in order to 

stress the switch-on spring (14), and the flank (58), 
which is unloaded during stressing the switch-on spring,  

 
has a flank plane (64) which abuts the common edge (62) 

and is inclined with respect to a radial straight line 
(66) through a center of the tooth, and wherein the 

flanks (76, 78) of the first tooth system (72) following 
the gap (54) in the direction of rotation (D) on the 

large wheel (16) abut against one another radially on an 
outer side at a common edge (80), and the tooth height of 

said tooth (72) is at the most as big as the tooth height 
of the rest of the teeth of the tooth system (52) on the 

large wheel (16). 
A spring drive as claimed in claim 1, wherein 
the flank plane (64) of the teeth (60) on the small wheel 

(20) is inclined at an angle of approximately 45° with 
respect to the radial straight line (66). 
A spring drive as claimed in any one of claims 1 
or 2, wherein the small wheel (20) and the large wheel 

(16) are spur gears having outer tooth systems. 
A spring drive as claimed in any one of claims 1 
to 3, wherein the first tooth (72) trailing behind the 

gap (54) has an involute shape on the flank (76) which is 
loaded during switch-on, and the flank (78) which is 

unloaded during switch-on has a flat flank part (74) 
which extends from the tooth edge (80) and is inclined 

preferably of approximately 60°, with respect to a radial 
straight line (72') through a center of the tooth. 
A spring drive as claimed in claim 3 or 4, 
wherein the first tooth (72) trailing behind the gap (54) 

is constructed such that it can be forced back in a 
sprung manner in a radial direction (82) and the second 

tooth (82) trailing behind the gap (54) has an involute 
shape on the flank (76) which is loaded during switch-on, 

and the flank (78) which is unloaded during switch-on has 
a flat flank part (74) which abuts the tooth edge (80) 

and is inclined preferably of approximately 60°, with  
 

respect to a radial straight line through the tooth 
center. 
A method for providing a small wheel and a large 
wheel for a spring drive as claimed in any one of claims 

1 to 5, wherein the teeth (60) are inclined on one side 
on a small wheel (20) having an involute tooth system, so 

that the tooth flanks (56, 58) abut against one another 
radially on the outside at a common edge (62) and a flank 

plane (64) extends from said edge (62) and is inclined 
with respect to a radial straight line (66) through a 

center of the tooth and wherein teeth are removed from 
the continuous tooth system (52) on a large wheel (16) 

having an involute tooth system, in order to form a gap 
(54), and the first teeth and optionally the second teeth 

(72, 84) which trail behind the gap (54) in the rotation 
direction (D) are inclined on one side. 
A method as claimed in claim 6, wherein 
inclining and removal of the teeth (60, 72, 84) is 

carried out by grinding. 
A method as claimed in claim 6 or 7, wherein the 
teeth (60) on the small wheel (20) and the first tooth 

and optionally the second tooth (72, 84), trailing behind 
the gap (54), on the large wheel (16) are hardened on the 

edge layer after inclining has been carried out.
