<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a fluorescent lamp comprising:- 
a bulb (1) of glass containing more than 15% of sodium 

(Na); a mercury (Hg) vapour sealed in the bulb (1); a 
fluorescent layer (12) formed inside an inner surface 

of the bulb (1), the fluorescent layer (12) comprising 
a fluorescent material including a rare earth 

fluorescent material; and a protection layer (11) 
formed between the inner surface of the bulb (1) and 

the fluorescent layer (12), the protection layer (11) 
having a thickness of from 0.2µm to 1.5µm and 

comprising fine grains of a metal oxide which absorbs 
ultraviolet rays and thus prevents or slows down any 

decrease in lighting efficiency of the lamp.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a fluorescent lamp with 
a fluorescent layer of a rare earth metal fluorescent 
substance, and a protection layer, both of which layers 
are coated on an inner surface of a bulb of the 
fluorescent lamp. A fluorescent lamp with a protection layer is 
disclosed in JP-A-55-161352, in which the protection 
layer is composed of crystalline titanium oxide, which 
is coated on an inner surface of a glass bulb. A 
fluorescent layer is then formed on an inner surface of 
the protection layer and is made of a conventional 
halophosphor activated by Mn²⁺ and Sb²⁺. The purpose 
of the protection layer is to prevent impurities 
contained in the glass bulb from diffusing into the 
fluorescent layer, as the impurities decrease the 
operating efficiency of the fluorescent layer. A fluorescent lamp using soda-lime glass for the 
glass bulb, is well-known and disclosed, for example, 
in JP-A-58-19850. Soda-lime glass contains little or 
no lead oxide (PbO) (which is an expensive material) 
and therefore the use of soda-lime glass reduces the 
manufacturing costs and also prevents environmental 
pollution caused by the scrapping of bulbs. However, 
soda-lime glass contains about 15-17% by weight of 
sodium (Na), which is three times the amount of sodium 
contained in lead glass, which is also used for making 
fluorescent lamps. The sodium (Na) contained in soda-lime 
glass diffuses into the fluorescent layer formed 
on the inner surface of the bulb when the bulb is 
heated during its manufacture and its operation. This 
diffused sodium reacts which elements of the 
fluorescent layer and reduces the luminous efficiency 
of the fluorescent layer. This sodium (Na) becomes an 
amalgam owing to the reaction with mercury (Hg) in the 
discharge space of the lamp, and the resulting amalgam  
 
constitutes coloured portions of the inner surface of 
the bulb. The coloured portions consequently increase 
the loss of transmission of light. The diffusion of 
sodium (Na) as described above is increased by 
ultraviolet irradiation from the bulb, in addition to 
heating. Furthermore, the thickness of the fluorescent 
layer using a rare earth metal fluorescent substance is 
thin in comparison with other fluorescent layers using 
a halophosphate phosphor activated by Mn²⁺ and Sb²⁺. 
As a result, mercury (Hg) diffuses through the 
fluorescent layer and reacts with sodium which has 
diffused to the inner surface of the bulb. The amalgam 
resulting from this reaction also creates coloured 
portions on the bulb which
