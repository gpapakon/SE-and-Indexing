<ABSTRACT>
An ink unit (22) for storing ink includes a porous member 
(30) impregnated with ink and a film (34) wrapped around the 

porous member. A container (20) has an opening (21) for allowing 
insertion and removal of the ink unit into and from the container 

and a lid (24) adapted to engage with the opening of the 
container. When the ink unit is inserted into the container, an 

O-ring (36) engages with a projecting portion, and the film is 
burst by the projecting portion (28) causing the porous member to 

abut against a filter (29). Then, the lid (24) is fitted to the 
opening of the foam storing case. Thus, the ink unit is quickly 

and neatly replaced, and the ink impregnated in the replaced ink 
unit can be supplied to a print head (16).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink supply
device for supplying ink to a print head.An ink supply device is disclosed in
United States Patent No. 4,771,295, for example. The ink
supply device is a head integrated-type ink cartridge
having an ink tank to which a print head for jetting ink
is integrally mounted. A porous member (which will be
hereinafter referred to as a "foam" member) impregnated
with the ink is provided inside the ink tank. The ink
tank is provided with an ink supply passage for
communication between the print head and the inside of the
ink tank. A filter is disposed at one end (an ink supply
opening) of the ink supply passage opening into the ink
tank. Further, the ink tank is provided with an
atmospheric air communication hole for communication
between the inside of the ink tank and atmospheric air.
The ink cartridge is mounted on a carriage. The carriage
is reciprocated, and simultaneously the print head is
driven to jet the ink, thereby printing desired data on
printing paper.Thus, the foam member impregnated with the ink is
enclosed in the ink tank. As compared with an ink
cartridge that has only the ink enclosed in the ink tank,
the above-mentioned ink cartridge with an open-type ink
supply mechanism effectively prevents the leakage of the
ink from the atmospheric air communication hole owing to
the ink retentivity of the foam member. Furthermore, the
ink cartridge buffers a pressure fluctuation in the ink
tank caused by movement of the ink due to acceleration
upon reciprocation of the carriage.However, the print head and the ink tank are
integral with each other in the head integrated-type ink
cartridge mentioned above. Accordingly, in replacing the
ink cartridge with another one after fully using the ink, 
the print head is unavoidably thrown away. As a result, a
user must bear the cost of a new print head, thus
increasing a running cost.In recent ink jet printers considering such a
problem, an ink cartridge having a replaceable ink tank
has been used so that only the ink tank can be replaced
with another one. Fig. 6 shows such an ink cartridge in
schematic section.As shown in Fig. 6, an ink cartridge 61 includes
an ink tank 56 as a resin case and a foam member 52
impregnated with ink. The foam member 52 is enclosed in
the ink tank 56. The ink tank 56 is provided with an ink
supply opening 60 for supplying the ink to a print head 50
for jetting the ink. A filter 54 is disposed at the ink
supply opening 60. The foam member 52 is in close contact
with the filter 54. An

An ink supply device for supplying ink to a print
head and including:-


a container (20) for ink having an ink supplying passage
(26) by which ink can be supplied from the container,
an ink unit (22) to be received in the container and
comprising a porous member (30) impregnated with ink;

characterised in that

said porous member (30) is wrapped with a film (34) and
said container has an interiorly projecting portion (28)
forming the ink supply passage (26),

   whereby when said ink unit is inserted into said
container, said film (34) of said porous member can be burst by

said projecting portion (28) to allow the ink contained in said
porous member to be supplied through said ink supply passage.
An ink supply device according to claim 1, wherein
the container (20) has an opening (21) for insertion and

removal of said ink unit (22) and

   a lid (24) removably engaging said opening (21).
The ink supply device according to claim 2, wherein
said lid has a puncturing portion (38) for puncturing said film

(34) of said ink unit and an air communication hole (39) for
providing communication between said porous member and

atmospheric air.
The ink supply device according to claim 2 or 3
including a spacer (32), which may be a grid member, defining a 

space between said porous member and said film member on a side
of said ink unit facing said lid.
An ink supply device according to any one of claims 1
to 4, wherein the ink supply passage communicates with a print

head on which the container is located.
An ink supply device according to any one of claims 1
to 5 wherein the porous member is compressed in an area

adjacent to the ink supply passage when inserted into the
container.
The ink supply device according to claim 6, wherein
when said ink unit is inserted into said container, said ink

unit is compressed by said projecting portion (28).
The ink supply device according to claim 7, further
comprising a filter (29) provided on said projecting portion

(28) that abuts against said ink unit.
The ink supply device according to claim 7 or 8,
wherein said projecting portion has an angled surface such that

said ink unit is non-uniformly depressed by said projecting
portion.
