<ABSTRACT>
A luminaire body (10) consists of translucent material, such as glass or the like. The luminaire body (10) has an annular fastening region (11), forming a luminous means insertion opening (12), for mounting on a lamp carrier having luminous means socket fitting. The luminaire body (10) is provided with a hollow luminaire body (13) which is connected in a bonded and integral manner with one side to the annular fastening region (11). The hollow luminaire body (13) forms along at least one generatrix, which surrounds it, a bearing and centring area region (21), on which in each case at least one plate-shaped body (22), formed from translucent material, such as glass or the like, bears in a light-guiding manner with at least one counterarea and to which it is bonded.
