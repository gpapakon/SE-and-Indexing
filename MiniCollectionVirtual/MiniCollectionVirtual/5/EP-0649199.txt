<ABSTRACT>
A monolithically integrated laser which is rapidly tunable over a wide 
optical frequency range comprises a frequency router (12) formed in a 

semiconductive wafer (10) defining a tuned cavity (20,24). A control circuit applies 
electrical energy to predetermined controllably transmissive waveguides (40
M
) 
connecting the frequency routing device (12) with reflective elements (20,24) defined in the 

wafer (10). This tunes the laser to a desired one of a plurality of optical frequencies (F
N
). 
Application of such electrical energy creates frequency selective pathways 

through the wafer (10) able to support selected lasing frequencies. Additional 
optical amplifiers (42
M
) are formed in the frequency router (12) to create lasing action in a 
preselected pathway. This laser is economical to construct and is useful in high 

capacity, high speed optical communications networks.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to optical communications systems. More 
particularly, this invention relates to lasers used in optical communications 
systems. The capacity and speed of communications systems may be increased by 
transmitting information in optical form over networks composed of optically 
transmissive nodes, fibers, waveguides, and the like. High capacity optical 
communications systems require that many optical signals be frequency 
division multiplexed in the components of an optical network. This requires 
that there be a way of conveniently producing electromagnetic energy at many 
different frequencies. An ideal device for producing optical energy useful in an 
optical communications system is a laser. Until now, there has been no  
 
convenient approach to creating a large number of high power optical 
frequencies with lasers. The performance of prior lasers have been limited in 
terms of tuning speed, frequency selectivity, or tuning range. All of these prior 
devices also have been expensive to implement. In accordance with this invention, a rapidly tunable laser has been 
developed which provides a well-defined set of frequencies at a high output 
power. This laser may be based upon photonic integrated circuitry which has a 
wide gain bandwidth. Such tunable lasers can be realized at a cost lower than 
that needed to implement prior lasers used in optical communications systems. In one example of the invention, a tunable laser is provided which 
employs integrated optical multiplexers and demultiplexers that incorporate 
optical amplifiers. Examples of such multiplexers and demultiplexers are 
disclosed in U.S. Patents 5,002,350 and 5,136,671. The devices disclosed therein, 
which do not incorporate the optical amplifiers employed by the invention, 
may be used to create a monolithic laser rapidly tunable over a wide frequency 
range. In specific terms, one example of the invention comprises an NxN 
frequency routing device formed on a semiconductive wafer between two 
reflective faces. Waveguides associated with the device each contain an 
integrated optical amplifier selectively acting as a gate which is either optically 
opaque to prevent the flow of optical energy through a respective waveguide or 
optically transparent with perhaps some gain depending on the level of the bias 
current. By selectively activating these optical amplifiers frequency selective 
pathways can be defined between the reflective faces. Each pathway is such 
that lasing action is supported at a particular
