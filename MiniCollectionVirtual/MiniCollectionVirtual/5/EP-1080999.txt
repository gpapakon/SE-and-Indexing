<ABSTRACT>
An air bag main body (10) is arranged along an inner side
of an occupant room extending from a pillar to a side roof

rail in its folded state and capable of being deployed
downward. An inflator (11) ejects gas for inflating the

air bag main body (10) so as to deploy the air bag main
body downward. An upper end portion (11a) of the inflator

(11) is preferably positioned somewhat lower than the head
position of a normal occupant. A gas communication pipe

(12) for introducing the gas from the inflator (11) to the
air bag main body (10) is capable of being deformed owing to

an excessive input from its external portion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to side air bag apparatus
of a vehicle, and more particularly to side air bag apparatus
for restraining a head portion or the like of an occupant at a
time of a side collision of a vehicle.As side air bag apparatus of a vehicle there is a
structure provided along a side roof rail, which is arranged in
a portion corresponding to a head portion of an occupant, in a
vehicle body.EP 841221 A
discloses side air bag apparatus of a vehicle
according to the preamble of claim 1.In accordance with a consideration of inventors of the
present invention, there is a case that the side air bag apparatus
is structured such that a bag-like air bag main body is provided
between a side roof rail and a garnish covering the side roof
rail in a folded state thereof. In the case mentioned above,
an end portion of the air bag main body is connected to an inflator
arranged between a pillar and a resin pillar garnish covering
the pillar at the side of an occupant room. Then, the structure
is made such that at the time of a side collision, gas is injected
into the air bag main body from the inflator so as to downward
inflate and deploy the air bag main body in a curtain shape,
thereby restraining so as to protect the head portion of the
occupant.In this case, since the inflator arranged at the pillar
side is structured so as to inject the gas due to a reaction of
a chemical agent therewithin or the like, rigidity of the
inflator itself is increased so as to resist against pressure
thereof.Accordingly, in order to more effectively absorb impact
energy applied to the head portion of the occupant, there can
be considered a structure that a plurality of ribs are formed 
on a back surface of a resin pillar garnish covering the inflator
and the ribs are deformed in the case that the head portion of
the occupant is brought into contact with a portion of the pillar
garnish corresponding to the inflator.However, in the structure mentioned above, since it is
necessary to form a plurality of ribs on the back surface of the
pillar garnish covering the pillar at the side of the occupant
room , a clearance between the inflator and the pillar garnish
is increased correspondingly. Accordingly, the pillar garnish
protrudes to the inner side of the occupant room, thereby
reducing the occupant room interior space.An object of the present invention is to provide a side
air bag apparatus of a vehicle which has no necessity of forming
a plurality of ribs on a back surface of a pillar garnish or the
like and can well

<CLAIMS>
Side air bag apparatus of a vehicle, comprising:

an air bag main body (10) arranged along an inner side
of an occupant room extending along a side roof rail (4) in

a folded state thereof and capable of being deployed
downward;
an inflator (11) for injecting gas capable of
inflating the air bag main body (10) so as to deploy the

air bag main body (10) downward, an upper end portion (11a)
of the inflator (11) being positioned lower than the normal

head position of an occupant; and
a gas communication member (12) for.introducing the
gas from the inflator (11) to the air bag main body (10),

the gas communication member (12) being deformable by an
excessive external force;

   
characterized in that
 the inflator (11) is arranged
along a rear pillar (3) in a state of being substantially

aligned in a longitudinal direction thereof, the rear
pillar (3) extending rearwardly downward from the side roof

rail (4), and the upper end portion (11a) of the inflator
(11) is set to a position substantially overlapping with a

seat back (17) in a side view of the vehicle.
Apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the air bag
main body (10) develops downward so as to form a curtain

shape.
Apparatus according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the
inflator (11) and the gas communication member (12) are

covered by a pillar garnish (15) from the inner side of the
occupant room. 
Apparatus according to any preceding claim, wherein
the gas communication member (12) is a metal pipe member.
Apparatus according to any preceding claim, wherein
the gas communication member (12) connects the inflator

(11) and the air bag main body (10) to each other in a
curved manner.
Apparatus according to any preceding claim, wherein
the inflator (11) generates combustion gas, and gas based

on the combustion gas is introduced to the air bag main
body (10) through the gas communication member (12).
Apparatus according to any preceding claim, wherein
the gas communication member (12) has a necked portion

controlling an injection property of the gas.
Apparatus according to claim 7, wherein the necked
portion is a contracted portion of the gas communication

member (12).
