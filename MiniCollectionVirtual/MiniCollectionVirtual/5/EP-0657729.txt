<ABSTRACT>
In a self-diagnose apparatus and method for 
detecting an occurrence of failure in any one of a 

plurality of inner pressure responsive sensors due to a 
variety mode of failures, an integral value IMEP
i
 within 
a predetermined integral interval of an inner cylinder 

pressure P for each engine cylinder is calculated, under 
an engine steady-state driving condition, a weight mean 

value BGIMEP
i
 for each engine cylinder of the integral 
value IMEP
i
 and a weight mean value TBGIMP for all 
cylinders are calculated, respectively, and a deviation 

JGIMEP between BGIMEP
i
 and TBGIMP is calculated. If 
JGIMEP ≧ SLSNS (threshold value), the self-diagnose 

apparatus and method determine that any one of the inner 
cylinder pressure responsive sensors which corresponds to 

one of the cylinders which indicates the result of JGIMEP 
≧ SLSNS has failed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a self-diagnosing
apparatus and method for determining
occurrence of any mode of failure in any one or
individual of inner cylinder pressure responsive sensors
applicable to an engine combustion state
detecting/controlling system.A Japanese Patent Application First Publication
No. Showa 62-26345 published on February 4, 1987
exemplifies a previously proposed engine combustion state
(misfire) detecting system in which a plurality of inner
cylinder pressure responsive sensors are disposed on
respective engine cylinders and the individual engine
cylinder combustion states are detected on the basis of
results of detections by the respective inner cylinder
pressure responsive sensors. Patent Abstracts of Japan, Volume 13, No. 358, page 916, 10.
August 1989, discloses a diagonising apparatus for determining
the cause of a failure of an inner-cylinder pressure sensor.
The apparatus detects the sensor signal, samples the signal at
crank angle positions before and behind the topdead center and
then determines the total sum of absolute values of differences
between the sample values at respective crank angle positions
adjacent to each other and difference values from the absolute
value of a difference between the first and the last sampled
value. Based on these values, the apparatus determines a faulty
sensor. It is an object of the present invention to
provide a self-diagnostic apparatus and method for
determining whether a failure in any one of inner
cylinder pressure responsive sensors in such mode of
failures as broken line (breakage) of any one of the
inner cylinder pressure responsive sensors, a short-circuiting
in any one of the inner cylinder pressure
responsive sensors, and a variation of any one of output
signal levels of the inner cylinder pressure responsive 
sensors occurs with a simpler self-diagnosing technique
and with a high accuracy of failure determination.The above-described object can be achieved by
providing a self-diagnosing apparatus for determining
whether a failure in any one of inner cylinder pressure
responsive sensors occurs, said inner cylinder pressure
responsive sensors being disposed on respective engine
cylinders so as to detect pressures within the respective
engine cylinders for the respective engine cylinders and
output inner cylinder pressure responsive signals
indicative thereof, said diagnostic apparatus comprising:
a) means for integrating one of said inner cylinder
pressure responsive signals which corresponds to one of
said engine
