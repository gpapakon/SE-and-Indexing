<CLAIMS>
Watertight claw for sheet piles (10) characterized by at least one groove
(20) situated inside the claw (14) and in which at least one seal (18) is

housed, so that a watertight connection is formed when said claw is
engaged with a claw of a neighbouring sheet pile.
Claw according to claim 1 characterized by at least one expandable seal
(18) situated in at least one housing (20) formed by said groove.
Claw according to any one of claims 1 or 2 characterized in that the seal
(18) is formed from a material which expands in contact with water.
Claw according to claim 1, characterized in that the seal (18) is a strip made
from an elastic material.
Claw according to claim 1, characterized in that the seal (18) is a pasty
material.
Claw according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterized by a thickening
tongue (22) situated on the side opposite the groove in the claw.
Claw according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterized by a tongue (36)
forming a projection which thus creates two housings (30, 32) along an

inner side of the claw (14).
