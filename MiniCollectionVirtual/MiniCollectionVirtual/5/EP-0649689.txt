<ABSTRACT>
In a method for the production of press fittings, especially those made of copper, a blank (11) is held in a die (2), supported on the inner wall in the pipe connection region by means of a supporting mandrel and is then upset axially, the material of the blank being made to flow into an annular groove (7, 8) provided in the die and surrounding the pipe connection region to form a bead running around the outside. After the supporting mandrel (19) has been removed, an all-round bead is formed in the blank from the inside in the region of the annular groove, whereupon the finished press fitting is removed from the die.

plastically deformable material, in particular copper,

in which a blank (11) with at least one pipe connection
region with circular cross-section (12, 13) is worked

from;

in which the blank (11) is received in a bottom die (2)
enclosing it on the outside at least in the pipe

connection region (12, 13);
in which a support spindle (19, 19') is then driven into
the pipe connection region (12, 13), against the inside

wall of which the support spindle (19, 19') abuts flush;
in which the blank (11) is then axially compressed at
least in the respective pipe connection region (12, 13),

whereby material of the blank (11) is caused to flow
into an annular groove (7, 8) provided in the bottom die

(2) and enclosing the pipe connection region (12, 13) by
forming a reinforcement running around the outer

circumference, whereby the wall thickness in the region
of the annular groove (7, 67) and the reinforcement

forming therein are increased, and

moved out, a bead is moulded out in a ring from the

inside in the region of the annular groove (7, 8) and
the compression fittings are subsequently removed from

the bottom die (2).

reinforcement is increased;

running around the outer circumference flows into an
annular groove (67, 623) defined by the bottom die (62)

and the section (617) of the bottom die and enclosing
