<ABSTRACT>
The gas exchange appts., such as oxygenising blood, has a hydrophiled membrane (22), wettened with water in operation. The gas path (30,26,32) is subjected to a gas containing oxygen, under positive membrane pressure, from the gas to the blood side. Pref. the membrane (22) is of a hydrophile material, esp. a mixt. of polysulphone and polyvinyl pyrrolidine.

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus (10, 100) for extracorporeal gas exchange, particularly for
oxygenating blood, with at least one gas exchanger (18, 118, 128) which is divided by a

semi-permeable membrane (22, 114, 130) into a blood chamber (24, 116, 132) and a gas
exchange chamber (26, 118, 134), an extracorporeal blood circuit (12, 102) being laid

through the blood chamber (26, 116, 132) while a gas path (28, 120, 142) passes through
the gas exchange chamber, and with a blood pump (20, 82, 110) incorporated into the

extracorporeal circuit (12, 102), characterised in that the membrane (22, 114, 130) is
hydrophilic or hydrophilised so that the pores are wettable with an aqueous fluid while the

gas path (26, 28, 32; 142, 134) is adapted to be exposed to oxygen-containing gas under
positive transmembranal pressure from the gas side to the blood side.
An apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in that the blood pump (20, 82)
is disposed upstream or downstream of the gas exchanger (18).
An apparatus according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that consecutively
disposed in the extracorporeal blood circuit (102) are a first gas exchanger (112) as a CO
2

exchanger and a second gas exchanger (128) as an oxygenator.
An apparatus according to claim 3, characterised in that incorporated into the
degassing chamber (116) of the first gas exchanger (112) is a degassing path (120) which

is provided on the feed side with a controllable air supply means (148) and on the air
discharge side with a variable gas throttling means (126) and in that the transmembranal

pressure at the membrane (114) of the first gas exchanger (112) can be adjusted with the
transmembranal pressure control unit (158).
An apparatus according to claim 3, characterised in that the second gas exchanger
(128) is connected to an oxygen source (144) via an oxygenating line (142) into which a

controllable oxygen supply means (146) is incorporated. 
An apparatus according to one of claims 3 to 5, characterised in that there is in the
extracorporeal blood circuit (102) at least one CO
2
 sensor (164, 166) from which the
signal is switched as an actual value to a main control unit (162) which compares the

actual value with a desired value and regulates the through flow of gas in the first gas
exchanger (112) on the basis of a result of such comparison.
An apparatus according to one of claims 3 to 6, characterised in that there is in the
extracorporeal blood circuit (102) at least one O
2
 sensor (174) the signal from which is
switched as an actual value to the main control unit (162) which compares the actual value

with the desired value and regulates the flow of oxygen which is adjustable at the oxygen
supply means (148) on a basis of the result of such comparison.
An apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 7, characterised in that the
membrane (22, 114, 130) consists of a hydrophilic material, in particular a mixture of

polysulphone and polyvinyl pyrrolidone.
An apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 8, characterised in that the

membrane (22, 114, 130) is asymmetrical and has a microporous skin layer and a coarse-pore
supporting layer, the mean pore size in the skin layer being between 2 and 20 nm

while the thickness of the skin layer is at most around several Âµm.
