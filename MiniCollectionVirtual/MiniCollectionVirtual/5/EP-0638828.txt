<ABSTRACT>
A connector (100) for terminating a cable comprising a buffered 
optical fiber (21, 31) surrounded by filamentary strength members and an outer jacket 

comprises a spring-loaded ferrule/barrel assembly (110/140), a unipartite cap (150) 
and a crimping sleeve (160). The unipartite cap comprises a one-piece structure having a 

connector end that mates with a twist-and-lock coupling apparatus, and is adapted to 
cooperate with the crimping sleeve to capture filamentary strength members contained 

within the cable at a cable-entrance end. The crimping sleeve has a first cylindrical 
portion (163) which surrounds the cable-entrance end of the cap, and a second cylindrical 

portion (164), whose diameter is smaller than the first cylindrical portion, and is adapted 
to engage the outer jacket of the cable when crimped. A rigid sheath tube (180) surrounds 

the buffered fiber within the cable so that it is not damaged during crimping, and is free to 
move back and forth within the cable.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to optical fiber connectors, and more 
particularly to a design having a reduced number of structural components. A frequently used optical fiber connector for terminating and connecting 
two optical fibers is one which is referred to as an ST® connector -- ST being a registered 
trademark of AT&T. The design of an ST connector is disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,934,785 
and includes an assembly comprising a ferrule and a barrel for holding same. The ferrule 
(sometimes also referred to as a plug) has a narrow passageway through its center for 
receiving an end portion of an optical fiber whose protective coating has been removed. 
The barrel (sometimes also referred to as a base member) also includes a passageway for 
receiving the coated optical fiber, and it terminates in a cylindrical cavity which holds the 
ferrule. Interconnection with another optical fiber generally involves butting ferrules 
together in such a way that there is maximum coupling of the light rays between their 
included fibers. This is no easy task, particularly in singlemode transmission where light 
rays are generally confined to a small region (mode field diameter) at the center of the 
fiber having a diameter which is less than ten microns. The ferrules, and hence the fibers 
themselves, are spring loaded so that they are urged together via a predetermined force. 
However, should the ferrules become slightly misaligned by the application of a non-axial 
force, there will be a considerable forward loss in the amount of light coupled between 
fibers. Moreover, even an axial force applied to the cable will cause considerable forward 
loss in coupled light when it exceeds the compression force of the spring which urges the 
ferrules together. With an air gap, a significant increase also occurs in return loss, or 
reflectance, which is caused by a difference in refractive index created by any separation 
between optical fiber ends. The challenge, then, is to design a connector that eliminates, 
or at least minimizes, the effect of such forces.  An improvement on the above patent is shown in U.S. Patent 4,812,009 
which discloses an optical fiber connector that includes an extender for transferring 
bending forces applied to its associated cable. Without the extender, these forces might 
cause the ferrule to move in such a way that optical disconnection occurs. During 
assembly of the connector, a ferrule/barrel assembly is captured between adjacent interior 
cavities of the cap using a C-shaped retainer

A connector (100) for terminating an optical fiber cable (30) and for 
making connection with a predetermined coupling apparatus, the connector including a 

ferrule/barrel assembly which comprises (i) a cylindrically shaped ferrule (110) having a 
passageway (101) through its longitudinal axis for receiving an optical fiber (21), (ii) a 

barrel member (140) also having a passageway through its longitudinal axis for receiving 
the optical fiber, comprising a ferrule-receiving end (141), a central portion (142), and an 

cap-engaging end (145) which is enlarged with respect to the central portion, and (iii) a 
spring member (61) disposed about the central portion of the barrel member 

   CHARACTERIZED BY: 
   a unipartite cap (150) having a cable entrance end adapted to receive an 

optical fiber cable, and a connector end adapted to make mechanical connection with the 
predetermined coupling apparatus, the unipartite cap including an internally disposed pair 

of cavities (151, 152) that are adjacent to each other but separated by an annular lip (153) 
which circumscribes an opening between said cavities whose cross-section area is slightly
