<ABSTRACT>
A dosing (metering, proportioning, controlled-volume) pump for liquids, in particular liquid metals, in particular lead or aluminium, consists of a housing (2) having a cylinder (3) in which a piston (4) can be guided in a longitudinally displaceable fashion, and of a valve (5). In order to achieve a high wear (abrasion) resistance, the cylinder (3) and the piston (4) consist of ceramic, in particular of silicon nitride.
