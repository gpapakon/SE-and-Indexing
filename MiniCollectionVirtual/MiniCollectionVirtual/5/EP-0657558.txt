<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an
inexpensive γ'-precipitation strengthening Fe-base
superalloy which is excellent in high-temperature
strength and structural stability and used for heat
resistant tools such as tools of hot extrusion presses
and hot forging dies, engine valves, gas turbine engine
parts, various kinds of coil or sheet springs, heat
resistant bolts and so forth.A γ'-precipitation strengthening Fe-base
superalloy known as A286 (JIS SUH660) (hereinafter
referred to as A286) is used in a wide field as an
inexpensive heat resistant alloy which can be used in a
high-temperature range up to about 600°C.The composition of A286 is specified in JIS
(Japanese Industrial Standard) as follows: up to 0.08 %
C (carbon), up to 1.0 % Si, up to 2.0 % Mn, up to 0.04 %
P, up to 0.03 % S, 24.0 to 27.0 % Ni, 13.5 to 16.0 % Cr,
1.0 to 1.5 % Mo, 0.10 to 0.50 % V, up to 0.35 % Al, 1.90
to 2.35 % Ti, 0.001 to 0.010 % B (boron), and the
balance of Fe.On the other hand, improved alloys of A286 are
proposed in JP-A-62-93353, JP-A-62-199752 and so forth.
Further, an alloy of a broader composition range
including A286 is proposed as an alloy for an exhaust 
engine valve in JP-A-56-20148.However, for effective use of energy in
consideration of the recent environmental problems,
temperatures at which various kinds of heat resistant
parts are used have been increased. For use in such a
high temperature range, high-temperature strength of
A286 is insufficient.A286 is also used as various kinds of high-strength
spring materials. For this use, however, when
A286 is subjected to aging treatment after cold working,
pseudo-stable γ'-phase which contributes to strengthening
is transformed into stable η-phase, which results in
a problem that a sufficient strength can not be
obtained.Moreover, any of the above-mentioned alloys
proposed in JP-A-62-93353, JP-A-62-199752 and so forth
as the improved alloys of A286 can not be said to have
been sufficiently increased in strength as compared with
A286. Furthermore, although JP-A-56-20148 discloses the
alloy including A286 for an exhaust engine valve which
has a broader composition range, it is difficult to say
that the alloy of JP '148 is considerably improved in
strength as compared with A286 if Ni and Cr contents of
the alloy are at about the same level as those of A286.An objective of the present invention resides 
in providing a γ'-precipitation strengthening Fe-base
superalloy having such a composition that the price is
not drastically higher than that of A286, and that the
