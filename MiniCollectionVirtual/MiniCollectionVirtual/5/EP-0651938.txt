and further side carriers (8,9,10,11) each with another rotary rake
(14,15,16,17) linked to the rotary rakes on both sides and articulated between

each other, the side carriers (8,9,10,11) hinging upward from their operation
position into a machine width reducing transport position, 
characterised in
that
 at least the swivel axles (20,22) of the side carriers (10,11) adjacent to
the centre carrier from an angle (α).
Haymaking machine according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the swivel
axles (20,21) of the side carriers (8,9) adjacent to the centre carrier in the first

machine half run in planes parallel to the travelling direction, and that the
swivel axles (20,21) of the second machine half are arranged at an angle in

relation to the swivel axles (20,21) of the first machine half such that at least
one of each of the outer side carriers (9,11) forms a sharp angle (α) with a

first plane (24) which is defined by the rotary axles of the rotary rakes (12,13)
supported on centre carrier (7).
Haymaking machine according to claim 2, 
characterised in that
 the swivel
axes (22,23) for the side carriers (10,11) of the first machine half form an

angle (σ1) of a first size opening towards the travelling direction (F) with a
second plane (34) which ex:ends vertically in relation to the first plane (24),

and that the swivel axles (20,21) for the side carriers (8,9) of the other 
machine half form an equiaxed angle (σ2) of a second size with the second

plane (34) or an angle (δ) opening against the travelling direction.
Haymaking machine according to claim 2, 
characterised in that
 the swivel
axles (20,21) for the side carriers (8,9) of the one machine half run in a plane

(34) and that at least the swivel axle (23) of the outer side carrier (11) of the
other machine half forms an angle (σ1) with plane (34).
Haymaking machine according to claim 4, 
characterised in that
 the swivel
axle (31) of an outer side carrier (11) forms a sharp angle (β1, β2) in relation

to swivel axle (30) of its side carrier (10) adjacent inside not only with plane
(34) but also with a plane (35) running cross to the travelling direction.
Haymaking machine according to claim 4, 
characterised in that
 the swivel
axle (31) of an outer side carrier (11) in relation to the swivel axle (30) of its

adjacent inner side carrier (10) is aligned such that, when in transport
position, the outer side carrier (11) grips behind the outer side carrier (9) of

the other machine half.
Haymaking machine according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that
 -when
in transport position - at least one outer side carrier (11) extends at an

angle of approx. 90° in relation to its inner side carrier (10) next to it.
Haymaking machine according to one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that

hydraulic positioning cylinders (32,33) intended to swivel the side carriers
(8,9,10,11) engage at the centre carrier (7) on the one hand and on the side

carriers (9,11) on the other hand.
