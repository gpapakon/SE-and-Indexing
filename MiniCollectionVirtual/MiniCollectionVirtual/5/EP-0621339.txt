<ABSTRACT>
An anti-human influenza virus antibody which recognizes 
the stem regions of haemagglutinin molecules of the H1N1 and 

H2N2 subtypes and has a neutralization activity but does not 
recognize the stem region of the H3N2 subtype and has no 

neutralization activity. An immunogenic artificial polypeptide 
having an antigenicity substantially same as the stem regions of 

haemagglutinin molecules. An immunogenic artificial polypeptide 
having an antigenicity substantially same as the stem regions of 

haemagglutinin molecule and lacking the globular head region of 
haemagglutinin molecules. 
This antibody is useful in the diagnosis and treatment of 
influenza A virus, while these polypeptides are useful as a 

vaccine.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a polypeptide
containing an antigen site which is recognized by an
antibody against the stem region in haemagglutinin
molecule of human influenza A virus and a gene coding
for this polypeptide.There are three types (A, B and C) of influenza viruses and
the worldwide prevalence of influenza costing a large number of
deaths is caused by human influenza A virus.Influenza A virus is further classified into various
subtypes depending on the antigenicities of haemagglutinin
(hereinafter referred to simply as HA) and neuraminidase
(hereinafter referred to simply as NA) which are viral surface
proteins. There have been known so far three subtypes of human
influenza A viruses, namely, the H1N1, H2N2 and H3N2 subtypes.The HA of influenza A virus comprises two structurally
distinct regions, namely, a globular head region and a stem
region. The globular head region contains a receptor binding
site which is responsible for virus attachment to a target cell
and participates in the haemagglutination activity of HA. On the
other hand, the stem region contains a fusion peptide which is
necessary for membrane fusion between the viral envelope and an
endosomal membrane of the cell and thus relates to fusion
activity [Wiley et al., Ann. Rev. Biochem., 56, 365 - 394
(1987)].All of anti-HA antibodies, which have been obtained
hitherto as an antibody capable of recognizing the H1N1 and H2N2 
subtypes, recognize the globular head region of HA. However,
this region most frequently undergoes antigen mutation.
Therefore, these antibodies are not common to the subtypes of
human influenza A virus and, further, lose the recognizing
ability with antigenic changes in the HA of the virus.On the other hand, Green et al. have synthesized a
polypeptide based on an amino acid sequence in the stem region
of HA of the H3N2 subtype and obtained antibodies against this
polypeptide. However, these antibodies have a low neutralization
activity (Published Japanese Translation of PCT Patent
Applications from Other Countries, No. 501714/1984).
Furthermore, the polypeptide per se employed as an antigen does
not react with rabbit antiviral serum obtained by immunizing
with the H3N2 subtype, which suggests that there is a problem
from the viewpoint of antigenicity too [Cell, 28, 477 - 487
(1982)]The infectivity of the HA of influenza A virus is
activated when the HA is cleaved at one site with a
protease. The larger polypeptide thus obtained is
called HA1 while the smaller one HA2. It is believed
that between these
