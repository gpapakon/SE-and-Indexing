<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to herbicides, and more 
particularly to N-aryloxyacyl-N-phenyltetrahydrophthalamic 
acid derivatives which are novel compounds, to methods of 
producing the same and to herbicides containing the same 
as the effective components. N-aryloxyacyl-N-phenyltetrahydrophthalamic 
acid derivatives of the present 
invention exhibit excellent herbicidal activity. The 
derivatives are useful as a herbicide which can be widely 
applied to upland, paddy field, orchard, pasture, turf, 
forest, non-crop land, etc. The derivatives are not 
harmful to crops. Hitherto, herbicidal activity of tetrahydrophthalamic 
acid derivatives has been well known. For example, N-(4'-chlorophenyl)-3, 
4, 5, 6-tetrahydrophthalamic acid methyl 
ester is known, as is disclosed in JP-A (Patent) 48-44425. However, the conventional tetrahydrophthalamic acid 
derivatives are not necessarily sufficient in herbicidal 
activity, or are substantially limited in herbicidal 
spectrum against weeds. Furthermore, these derivatives 
are insufficient in selectivity between crops and weeds, 
thereby inducing problems of safety for crops. Compounds 
disclosed in JP-A (Patent) 4-803407 are known as those 
solving these problems and exhibiting excellent herbicidal 
activity. However, there is no description about 
compounds having N-aryloxyacyl group in N-acyl group part 
nor about biological activity of these compounds. It is an object of the present invention to solve the 
aforementioned conventional problems, and to provide N-aryloxyacyl-N-phenyltetrahydrophthalamic  
 
acid derivatives 
as novel compounds exhibiting excellent herbicidal 
activity against various very harmful weeds and not being 
harmful to crops, methods of producing the same and 
herbicides containing the same as the effective 
components. The inventors have found that novel tetrahydrophthalamic 
acid derivatives each having a specific 
substituent aryloxyacyl group bonded to an amide nitrogen 
atom are very excellent in herbicidal activity, 
selectivity and herbicidal spectrum, and completed the 
present invention. The present invention provides N-aryloxyacyl-N-phenyltetrahydrophthalamic 
acid derivatives represented by 
the general formula [I], methods of producing the same, 
and herbicides containing the same as the effective 
components: 
wherein X and Y each individually represent hydrogen atoms 
or halogen atoms, Ar represents a substituted or 
unsubstituted phenyl group or naphthyl group, R¹ 
represents a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, a lower alkyl 
grou
