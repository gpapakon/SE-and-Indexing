<DESCRIPTION>
 SOL-GEL METHOD FOR PREPARING AN ALKALINE EARTH METAL BORATEThe present invention concerns a method for preparing alkaline earth metal borates and articles comprising such borates. Beta-barium borate (β-BBO) is one of the materials having non-linear optical properties, and more particularly having the capacity in a certain range of wavelengths, to produce a second harmonic generation (frequency 2x) when it is submitted to an incident radiation of frequency x. Unlike other materials with usual sources of incident radiation, this second harmonic generation (SHG) is of sufficient amplitude to be observed and manipulated.Another advantage of β-BBO is that its optical damage threshold is high, i.e. 3-4 times the threshold of potassium dihydrogenophosphate, which is used as a reference material in non-linear optics. This means that β- BBO can be used with short pulse, high power lasers as sources of incident radiations without being damaged. Also, β-BBO can be used for non-linear optics within a range of temperatures which is broader than for any other material. However, to be actually usable as a non-linear integrated optical device, a material has also to be obtainable in crystalline thin film form, on appropriate substrates. Substances such as BBO are usually prepared by solid state reaction and sintering of metal oxide and metal carbonate mixtures. However, the treatment of these physical mixtures requires prolonged grinding/heating cycles. These methods are complex, expansive, provide non- uniform films with uncontrolled stoichiometry and do not permit easily to introduce dopants in a quantitatively controlled manner. Some of these problems may be partially overcome by tedious and time consuming trial and error combinations of the chemical elements in question, in order to achieve materials and films with the desired composition ratios. Besides, certain alkoxides have an alkaline pH, and 

 hydrolysis at alkaline pH produces powders ; a stable solution is usually obtainable with the addition of acids. However, the undesirable consequence of the addition of acids is an inferior crystallinity and the increase of crystallization temperatures when the film is subjected to thermal treatments.Because of these difficulties, there has been a strong interest in the preparation of oxide ceramics by chemical methods in order to achieve the desired stoichiometric composition and atomic level homogeneity, and to reduce processing time and temperatures. One of such methods is sol-gel method, which consists in a

6 - The method of claim 1, wherein the earth alkaline metal is barium and the resulting borate is beta barium borate.
7 - The method of claim 6, wherein the boron alkoxide is selected from methoxide, ethoxide, propoxide, butoxide and trimethoxyboxine. 8 - The method of claim 6 or 7, wherein the barium alkoxide is selected from 2-methoxyethoxide and methoxide. 9 - The method of any of claims 1-8, wherein the heating step comprises at least one step for removal of water and solvents, a step for the completion of hydrolysis, a step for the removal of residual organics and a step 


 for the crystallization of the metal borate. 10 - The method of claim 9, wherein the water and solvent removal step is repeated after each deposition of the materials on the substrate.
