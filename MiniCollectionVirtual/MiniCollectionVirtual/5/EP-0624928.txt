<ABSTRACT>
A shielded electrical connector assembly (40) 
includes a conductive housing (42) having receptacle means 

(48) for receiving a complementary mating connector (24). 
A terminal module (44) includes a dielectric terminal block 

(60) mounted in the conductive housing at the receptacle. 
The terminal block mounts a plurality of spaced terminals 

(62) having contact portions (68) projecting into the receptacle 
and adapted for electrical interconnection with 

appropriate contacts of the complementary mating connector. 
The terminal block has openings (66) between the spaced 

terminals. The conductive housing includes integral shield 
portions (56) projecting into the openings in the terminal 

block between the spaced terminals. The housing also includes 
integral ground portions (50,52) in the receptacle 

and adapted for interconnection with appropriate ground 
contacts of the mating connector.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to the art of 
electrical connectors and, particularly, to a shielding and 
grounding electrical connector assembly, such as for use 
with coaxial cables. Shielded coaxial cables have a conductor core 
with a sheath of insulation therearound, an outer insulating 
jacket and a shield means, such as a braid or foil, 
between the sheath and the jacket. Coaxial cables of the 
character described are becoming increasingly miniaturized 
and commonly are termed "microcoaxial" cables and are used 
for high speed signal applications. In order to avoid having to prepare the cables, 
such as exposing the braided or foil shield means in conventional 
crimping or soldering termination techniques, 
axially terminating connector systems have been designed, 
particularly for microcoaxial cables. In particular, signal 
terminals have have been employed within improved connector 
assemblies such that the signal terminals have at least one 
deflectable wall portion for displacing the insulating 
sheath of the cable to terminate the core upon application 
of a force directed generally parallel to the longitudinal 
axis of the cable. U.S. Patent No. 5,116,230 to Dechelette 
et al, dated May 26, 1992 and assigned to the assignee of 
this invention, shows a further improved connector assembly 
for terminating a shielded coaxial cable, in which a conductive 
grounding terminal means includes piercing means 
for displacing the outer insulating jacket of the cable  
 
upon application of a force on the grounding terminal means 
generally parallel to the longitudinal axis of the cable. 
Therefore, the cable can be both grounded and terminated in 
response to application of axial forces by very simple 
application tooling. Coaxial cable connector assemblies of the character 
described immediately above often are mated with electrical 
connector assemblies mounted to printed circuit 
boards, particularly a header-type connector having mating 
signal terminal pins, along with grounding terminal pins 
engageable with the conductive grounding terminal means of 
the coaxial cable connector. This invention is directed to 
providing a connector assembly, such as a header connector 
assembly, for mating with a coaxial cable connector assembly, 
the header connector assembly including novel shielding 
means and grounding means. An object, therefore, of the invention is to 
provide a new and improved shielded electrical connector 
assembly and, particularly, such an assembly which is readily 
applicable for
