<ABSTRACT>
For a chart recorder having a tiltable and removable desk arrangement (10), a driver arrangement is proposed in which, in order to prevent tolerance limits from being exceeded within the drive arrangement, an electric motor (14) is permanently connected to a desk frame (15). The desk frame (15) has a tractor (12) for transporting a recording carrier (11) which is operatively connected to the electric motor (14) by a transmission (13).

<CLAIMS>
Drive arrangement for a plotter including at least one
electric motor for transporting a recording medium and also

including a modular support arrangement comprising storage
means and power transmission means for transporting the

recording medium, wherein the electric motor (14) for
transporting the recording medium (11) is a component of the

modular support arrangement (10), characterised in that the
support arrangement (10) comprises mutually insulated sliding

contacts for supplying energy to the electric motor (14), said
contacts being associated with corresponding mutually insulated

slideways on a wall within the plotter.
Drive arrangement in accordance with Claim 1, characterised
in that the electric motor (14) is in the form of a low voltage

dc motor.
Drive arrangement in accordance with Claim 1, characterised
in that a sensor for monitoring any departure of the support

arrangement (10) from its operational position is provided in
the housing (1) of the plotter, said sensor being connected to

a switching stage whose outputs are connected to the slideways
on a wall within the plotter.
