<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus is provided for encoding and decoding to facilitate coherent communication. In encoding, reference symbols are inserted into a stream of input data symbols (110) to form a reference coded stream of input data symbols (114). Subsequently, the reference coded stream of input data symbols are prepared for transmission over a communication channel by spreading the reference coded stream of input data symbols with a spreading code prior to transmission over the communication channel. In decoding, a received communication signal (120) is despread with a spreading code to derive a stream of reference samples (132) and a stream of data samples (138). The channel response is estimated by utilizing the stream of reference samples (132). Finally, an estimated data symbol is detected from the stream of data samples (138) by utilizing the estimated channel response.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to communication systems which
employ spread-spectrum signals and, more particularly, to a method
and apparatus for coherent communication in a spread-spectrum
communication system.Communication systems take many forms. In general, the
purpose of a communication system is to transmit information-bearing
signals from a source, located at one point, to a user destination, located
at another point some distance away. A communication system
generally consists of three basic components: transmitter, channel, and
receiver. The transmitter has the function of processing the message
signal into a form suitable for transmission over the channel. This
processing of the message signal is referred to as modulation. The
function of the channel is to provide a physical connection between the
transmitter output and the receiver input. The function of the receiver is
to process the received signal so as to produce an estimate of the 
original message signal. This processing of the received signal is
referred to as demodulation.One type of communication system is a multiple access spread-spectrum
system. In a spread-spectrum system, a modulation technique
is utilized in which a transmitted signal is spread over a wide frequency
band within the communication channel. The frequency band is much
wider than the minimum bandwidth required to transmit the information
being sent. A voice signal, for example, can be sent with amplitude
modulation (AM) in a bandwidth only twice that of the information itself.
Other forms of modulation, such as low deviation frequency modulation
(FM ) or single sideband AM , also permit information to be transmitted
in a bandwidth comparable to the bandwidth of the information itself.
However, in a spread-spectrum system, the modulation of a signal to be
transmitted often includes taking a baseband signal (e.g., a voice
channel) with a bandwidth of only a few kilohertz, and distributing the
signal to be transmitted over a frequency band that may be many
megahertz wide. This is accomplished by modulating the signal to be
transmitted with the information to be sent and with a wideband
encoding signal.Three general types of spread-spectrum communication
techniques exist, including direct sequence modulation, frequency
and/or time hopping modulation, and chirp modulation. In direct
sequence modulation, a carrier signal is modulated by a digital code
sequence whose bit rate is much higher than the information signal
bandwidth.Information (i.e. the message signal
