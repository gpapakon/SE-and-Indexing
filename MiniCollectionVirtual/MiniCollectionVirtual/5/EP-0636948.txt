<ABSTRACT>
An imaging system (10) incorporating the invention includes a movable 
photoconductive surface (14), and an electrostatic system (16) for repetitively 

charging the photoconductive surface (14) to a first charge potential. A laser 
system (18) selectively discharges the photoconductive surface (14) to a second 

charge potential in accordance with image signals. A color toner supply (38, 40, 
42, or 44) provides color toner (66) to the photoconductive surface (14), the 

color toner (66) exhibiting a charge state that is attracted by the second charge 
potential and is repelled by the first charge potential. An adhesive toner supply 

(46) provides adhesive toner (70) to the photoconductive surface (14), the 
adhesive toner (70) exhibiting an opposite sense charge state to the color toner 

(66). The adhesive toner (70) is attracted by the first charge potential and is 
repelled by the second charge potential. A controller (30, 32, 34, 36) causes 

the color toner (66) to be applied to the photoconductive surface (14) and the 
entire photoconductive surface (14) is recharged. Thereafter the laser system 

(18) discharges non-imaged areas of the photoconductive surface (14) to a 
charge potential that repels the adhesive toner (70). Then, the adhesive toner 

(70) is applied to imaged areas which remain at the first charge potential. 
During a subsequent image transfer the adhesive toner (70) aids in complete 

image transfer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to adhesive promotion between a
toner and a carrier sheet in an electrophotographic printer, more particularly, to
a method and system for selectively applying an adhesion promoter to a pre-toned
surface.As is known, a photoconductive surface in an electrophotographic
printer is first charged to a uniform potential and then is "exposed" to an image
to be reproduced by the scanning of a laser beam thereacross. The
photoconductor thereby obtains an electrostatic latent image which, in a
preferred embodiment, constitutes a matrix of discharged pixels on the
photoconductor's surface. In a black/white printer, the photoconductive surface
is developed using a black toner which adheres to the discharged pixel areas to
form the image. Thereafter, the toned photoconductive surface is then carried
to a transfer station where the image is transferred to a media sheet.In a multi-color printer, successive images are developed
employing different color toners supplied from corresponding toner modules.
Color printing is normally done with yellow, cyan and magenta toners that are
applied, in registration, during successive rotations of the photoconductive
surface. The printer also generally includes a toner module with black DDR
toner since it is required in virtually all commercial color printing applications
The developed color image is then transferred from the photoconductive surface
to a media sheet. Heat is usually applied to permanently fuse the image to the
media sheet in order to form a completed multi-color print.A number of factors may hinder transfer of a developed image to a
media sheet and cause impaired image quality. For instance, transfer efficiency
is uncertain if adhesion of the toner to the photoconductive surface is more 
favored energetically than adhesion of the toner to a paper surface (i.e. direct
transfer), or to an intermediate transfer surface (i.e. indirect transfer). Paper
sheets have a surface roughness which is dimensionally greater than toner
particle size and is sometimes greater than the dimensions of the image to be
imprinted. At high resolutions, very small image elements may not be
successfully transferred to a paper sheet, and in extreme circumstances, may
not even contact the paper. A second mode of incomplete image transfer may
occur when an imaged (toned) area lacks sufficient mechanical integrity to
transfer to a sheet without tearing. If parts of the image contact the sheet, but
other parts do not, the image may separate. Each of these
