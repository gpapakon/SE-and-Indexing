<DESCRIPTION>
The subject invention is generally directed to
thermal ink jet printers, and more particularly to tab circuit
fusible links that enable selective electrical isolation and
encoding of information on a tab circuit for a thermal ink jet
printhead cartridge.An ink jet printer forms a printed image by printing
a pattern of individual dots at particular locations of an
array defined for the printing medium. The locations are
conveniently visualized as being small dots in a rectilinear
array. The locations are sometimes "dot locations", "dot
positions", or "pixels". Thus, the printing operation can be
viewed as the filling of a pattern of dot locations with dots
of ink (see e.g. EP-A-0 412 459).Ink jet printers print dots by ejecting very small
drops of ink onto the print medium, and typically include a
movable carriage that supports one or more printheads each
having ink ejecting nozzles. The carriage traverses over the
surface of the print medium, and the nozzles are controlled
to eject drops of ink at appropriate times pursuant to command
of a microcomputer or other controller, wherein the timing of
the application of the ink drops is intended to correspond to
the pattern of pixels of the image being printed.The printheads of thermal ink jet printers are
commonly implemented as replaceable printhead cartridges which
typically include one or more ink reservoirs and an integrated
circuit printhead that includes a nozzle plate having an array
of ink ejecting nozzles, a plurality of ink firing chambers
adjacent respective nozzles, and a plurality of heater
resistors adjacent the firing chambers opposite the ink
ejecting nozzles and spaced therefrom by the firing chambers.
Each heater resistor causes an ink drop to be fired from its
associated nozzle in response to an electrical pulse of
sufficient energy.A thermal ink jet printhead requires a certain
minimum energy to fire ink drops of the proper volume (herein  
called the turn on energy). Turn on energy can be different
for different printhead designs, and in fact varies among
different samples of a given printhead design as a result of
manufacturing tolerances. As a result, thermal ink jet
printers are configured to provide a fixed ink firing energy
that is greater than the expected lowest turn on energy for
the printhead cartridges it can accommodate.A consideration with utilizing a fixed ink firing
energy is that firing energies excessively greater than the
actual turn on energy of a particular printhead cartridge
result in a shorter operating lifetime for
