<ABSTRACT>
A valve block assembly for controlling the flow 
of air at either of two pressures to the air operated 

mechanisms of a section of an I.S. machine comprising 
a plurality of valves each having a cylindrical 

sleeve and a valve element axially displaceable 
within the cylindrical sleeve between first and 

second control positions, a valve block body 
including a corresponding plurality of bores for 

receiving the plurality of valves, the valve sleeves 
being closed at one end and having an opening 

extending through the closed end through which air 
under pressure can be delivered to the valve, the 

opening being selectively configured so that the 
sleeves can have two selected orientations each 

defining an opening location spaced from the opening 
location at the other orientation, means for 

maintaining the valve sleeve at either of the two 
orientations, a first conduit communicating with the 

openings when the sleeve is at one of the 
orientations for delivering air at one pressure to 

the valves and a second conduit communicating with 
the openings when the sleeve is at the second 

orientation for delivering air at a second pressure 
to the valves.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
a valve block assembly for controlling the flow of air at
either of two pressures to air operated mechanisms of a section
of an
I. S. (individual
section) machine which makes glass containers from molten
gobs of glass.Each individual section of an I.S. machine has a blank
side which forms a parison from the gob in a blank side
mould and a blow side which forms the final glass container
from the parison in a blow side mould. A number of movable
mechanisms such as a blank side mould opening and closing
mechanism, a plunger mechanism to be moved into a gob
contained within the blank side mould, an invert mechanism
for taking the formed parison and carrying it to the blow
side, a blow side mould opening and closing mechanism, a
takeout for removing the formed glass container from the
blow side and depositing it on a dead plate and a pusher
which will displace a bottle from the dead plate onto a
conveyor are associated with each section and these
mechanisms require air having a variety of pressures.To control the application of this air, each section
has a valve block which supports a number of on/off valves
which are operated by electronically controlled solenoids.
A prior art valve block is shown in US Patents numbered
3,918,489 and 4,382,451.US 4,382,451 discloses a valve block assembly for
controlling the flow of air at either of two pressures to
air operated mechanisms of a section of an I.S. machine
comprising a valve block body including a plurality of
bores, and a plurality of plenum passages through which air
at different pressures can be provided. For each solenoid
operated valve, which is secured to the outside of the valve
block body, a connection with one of the plenum passages can
be established by the appropriate positioning of a manually
operated selector mechanism; when the selector mechanism is
in one position the inlet of the valve is connected to a 
plenum passage at one pressure - when the selector mechanism
is in another position the inlet of the valve is connected
to a plenum passage at another pressure. It is therefore
possible to set up the valve block assembly so that each
solenoid valve of the assembly is provided with air at a
desired pressure.
Said selector mechanism thus also represents a valve, however it
does not comprise a sleeve with a particular opening as claimed.It is an object of the present invention to provide an
improved valve block assembly for a section of an I.S. machine.The invention comprises a valve block assembly for
controlling
