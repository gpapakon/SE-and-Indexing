<CLAIMS>
A process for the preparation of inulin derivatives of the general
formula I



   wherein

R = CH
2
OH, - CHOH - (CH
2
)
m
-CH
3
,
m is an integer from 0 to 10,
n is on average a number from 10 to 50 and preferably 
>
 15,
a and b are a number from 0 to 3, wherein a + b = 3,
G is a glucose pyranose group, and
F is a fructofuranose group,
 
or mixtures thereof with different - O (CH
2
)-R groups, characterised
in that inulin of the following general formula II



wherein n, G and F are as indicated above,

in aqueous solution with an alkyl epoxide of the following formula
III



wherein m is an integer between 0 and 10,

is heated in the presence of an alkaline catalyst at a temperature
of 40 to 100°C and with an inulin concentration of 20 to 50 wt.%,

and the resulting alkoxyinulin of the formula I is isolated.
A process according to claim 1, characterised in that an OH-laden,
strongly basic anion exchange resin is used as an alkaline

catalyst.
