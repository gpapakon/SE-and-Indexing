<ABSTRACT>
An improved stirring apparatus having its mixing 
performance and power efficiency enhanced with a simple 

construction, is disclosed herein. On the opposite sides of 
a rotary stirring shaft (4) are mounted a vertical flat 

blade (5) and a first inclined flat blades (6) as opposed to 
each other, a first vertical flat blade (8) associated with 

a sweptback blade is mounted to the stirring shaft (4) at 
the position under the first inclined flat blades (6), and 

a second inclined flat blade or blades (7) and a second 
vertical flat blade (9) associated with a sweptback blade 

are mounted to the stirring shaft (4) at the position under 
the vertical flat blade (5). When the stirring shaft 

rotates, ascending flows of liquid to be processed along the 
inner wall within a vessel are generated by the vertical 

flat blade (5) and the first and second vertical flat blades 
(8, 9) each associated with a sweptback blade, descending 

flows of liquid to be processed are generated by the 
inclined flat blades (6, 7), and thereby a mixing 

performance can be enhanced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a stirring 
apparatus available for the purpose of various stirring 
operations including mixing and reaction operations, for 
instance, stirring of a liquid-liquid system of solutions 
having different viscosities, stirring of a solid-liquid 
system of slurry-like materials or the like. As stirring blades equipped in heretofore known 
stirring apparatuses, paddle blades, turbine blades, 
propeller blades, multi-stage paddle blades or the like were 
used for stirring a fluid having a low viscosity, and 
helical ribbon blades, screw blades or the like were used 
for stirring a fluid having a high viscosity. In the case where a liquid is fed into a stirring 
vessel filled with another liquid having a different 
viscosity, and an operation of uniformly mixing two or more 
kinds of liquids having different viscosities, that is, the 
so-called hetero-viscosity mixing is carried out by means of 
the above-described stirring blades in the prior art, 
however, the problems as described in the following are 
involved.  
 
(1) If the stirring blades for low-viscosity use 
(paddle blades, turbine blades, propeller blades, multi-stage 
paddle blades or the like) were used, then there were 
problems that a mixing performance was poor because 
circulation flows of the material to be stirred within a 
stirring vessel were formed only in the proximity of the 
stirring blades and circulation flows over the entire space 
within the vessel could not be formed, and also that a power 
efficiency was also poor because stirring power is consumed 
only in the proximity of the stirring blades. (2) If the stirring blades for high-viscosity use 
(helical ribbon blades, screw blades or the like) were used, 
then there were problems that although the blades revealed 
an excellent mixing performance for high-viscosity liquids 
(liquids having a viscosity of several hundreds - several 
thousands poises or higher), circulation flows over the 
entire space within the vessel could not be formed for 
relatively low-viscosity liquids (liquids having a viscosity 
of several thousands - several hundreds or lower), and so, 
a mixing performance was poor. In addition, such type of 
stirring blades had shortcomings that manufacture was 
difficult and high in cost and also cleaning at the time of 
stoppage of an operation was not easy because the 
configurations of the blades were complicated. A stirring apparatus for reactions of highly viscous 
materials is known from DE-38 17 380 A1 and comprises a 
vessel in

<CLAIMS>
A stirring apparatus comprising a vertical flat blade 
(5) mounted on one side of a rotary stirring shaft (4) 

disposed vertically within a vessel (1) and parallel to the 
axis of the stirring shaft (4); 


a plurality of first inclined flat blades (6) mounted on 
the other side of said stirring shaft (4) in the range of the 

mounting height of said vertical flat blade (5) at an angle 
with respect to the axis of the stirring shaft and spaced 

from one another so as to generate a descending flow; 
a first vertical flat blade (8) with a sweptback 
portion, this blade being positioned directly under said 

first inclined flat blades (6) and mounted on said stirring 
shaft (4) parallel to its axis; 
one or a plurality of second inclined flat blades (7) 
positioned directly under the vertical flat blade (5) at an 

angle with respect to the axis of said stirring shaft (4) and 
spaced from one another so as to generate a descending flow;

vertical flat blades (8, 9) are outer sections of the 

respective blade which are retreated in the opposite 
direction of rotation of the blades; and
  
 

   whereby said vertical flat blade (5), said first and 
second inclined flat blades (6, 7) and said first and second 

vertical flat blades (8, 9) with the sweptback portions are 
disposed so as not to come into contact with said vessel (1).
