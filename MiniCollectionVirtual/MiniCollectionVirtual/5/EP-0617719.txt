<DESCRIPTION>
 THERMOFORMABLE, CHEMICAL RESISTANT POLYMER BLENDSThe present invention relates to a thermoplastic resin composition having high resistance to attack by chemicals such as halogenated hydrocarbons and especially hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFC's) and good sheet thermoforming characteristics. More particularly, the present invention relates to such a composition and to thermoformed objects therefrom, such as refrigerator or freezer liners. In a further embodiment the present invention relates to structures comprising such thermoformed articles having adhered to one surface thereof a polyurethane foam, especially such a foam prepared by the use of hydrochlorofluorocarbon blowing agents.It is previously known in the art to prepare thermoformable sheets from thermoplastic resins such as impact modified polystyrene (HIPS) and impact modified styrene acrylonitrile (ABS) resins. Such thermoformable resins have found wide use in the preparation of numerous objects such as containers, toys, and appliance components. In particular, refrigerator or freezer liners are often thermoformed from such a sheet material. In the manufacture of a typical refrigerator or freezer such a liner is placed into an outer jacket formed of metal or similar material that forms the outer cabinet or door of the refrigerator or freezer, and the space between the outer jacket and the liner is filled with a thermosetting foam, usually polyurethane foam. Typically polyurethane foams are prepared by blending a polyurethane forming mixture comprising a polyhydroxyl compound and a polyisocyanate compound with a suitable blowing agent and allowing the viscous liquid mixture to expand due to the effects of the blowing agent while the reaction to form the polyurethane takes place. By injecting the polyurethane forming mixture in the free space between the refrigerator or freezer liner and the outer jacket, and allowing the mixture to foam in place, a unitary structure is formed that greatly aids in the rigidity of the resulting refrigerator or freezer. Varying degrees of adhesion between the polyurethane foam and the liner may be obtained during the foaming process.A number of chemicals are suitably employed as blowing agents, especially halogenated hydrocarbons, many of which are aggressive solvents for vinyl aromatic polymers. 

 Recently, hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC) and hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) blowing agents have been employed in a number of applications due to the reduced environmental degradation believed to result from releasing such
