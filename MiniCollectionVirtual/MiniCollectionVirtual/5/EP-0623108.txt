<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improvement in a process for the preparation 
of optically active carboxylic acids and the esters thereof. More particularly this 
invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of aliphatic carboxylic 
acids and the esters thereof by adding to a mixture of the diastereomeric salts of 
such materials an organic or inorganic salt. Resolution of racemic aryl-substituted aliphatic carboxylic acids has been 
described in the literature. Kaiser et al., J. Pharm. Sci., Vol. 65, No. 2, 269-273 
(February 1976) formed the S(-) α-methylbenzylamine salt of S(+)-ibuprofen, 
removed it from the reaction mixture by filtration, and recrystallized it from 
isopropanol and then from methanol. After acidifying the 3N aqueous sulfuric acid 
and extracting with ether, S(+)-ibuprofen was obtained, m.p. 50-52°, [α]D +57·, 
with 95% optical purity as determined by GLC analysis. Cox et al., J. Pharmacol. 
Exp. Ther., Vol. 232, No. 3, 636-643 (March 1985), using the Kaiser et al. method, 
were able to obtain an S(+)-ibuprofen preparation which was 99% S isomer and 
1% R isomer (w/w). Other methods of separating the enantiomers of racemates can be effected 
by preparing a salt of the acid with an alkaloid or similar resolving agent such as 
cinchonidine, then separating the products by fractional crystallization from a solvent 
in which the salt of the dextrorotatory isomer is less soluble. The (+)-salt can 
then be acid cleaved to yield pure enantiomer. See, for example, U. S. Patent No. 
4,209,638 issued June 24, 1980, and U. S. Patent No. 3,637,767 issued January 25, 
1972, which relate to resolution of naproxen and related compounds. US-3,904,683 relates to a process for the resolution of d- and 
1-2-(6-methoxy-2-naphthyl)propionic acid wherein a mixture of 
water soluble salts of the d- and 1-enantiomers are treated 
with dehydroabietylamine, the crystallized dehydroabietylamine 
salt is removed leaving a mother liquor enriched in the water 
soluble dehydroabietylamine salt of the d-enantiomer. For 
obtaining the d-enantiomer a salt is added resulting in 
crystallization thereof. U. S. Patent No. 5,015,764 discloses and claims a process for increasing the 
amount of the desired enantiomer obtained from a racemic mixture of C1 to C6 
linear or branched aliphatic carboxylic acid or ester thereof. The process comprises: 
(i) forming a salt solution comprising the racemic mixture of the C1 to C6 linear 
or branched aliphatic carboxylic acid or ester thereof and an organic or inorganic
