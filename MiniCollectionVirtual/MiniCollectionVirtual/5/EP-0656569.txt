<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electrostatic liquid 
developers comprising resin particles, a charge director 
compound and a nonpolar liquid having a narrow boiling 
point range. It is known that a latent electrostatic image can be 
developed with toner particles dispersed in an insulating 
nonpolar liquid. Such dispersed materials are known as 
liquid toners or liquid developers. Useful liquid 
developers comprise a thermoplastic resin and nonpolar 
liquid. Generally a suitable colorant is present such as a 
dye or pigment. The colored toner particles are dispersed 
in the nonpolar liquid which generally has a high-volume 
resistivity in excess of 10⁹ ohm centimeters, a low 
dielectric constant below 3.0, and a high vapor pressure. 
The toner particles are less than 30 µm average size as 
determined using the Malvern Particle Sizer described 
below. After the latent electrostatic image has been 
formed and developed by the liquid toners, the image may 
subsequently be transferred to a carrier sheet. The liquid developers of the prior art comprise resin 
particles dispersed in mixed hydrocarbon liquids, which 
have wide molecular weight ranges and hence wide boiling 
point ranges. These developers have the disadvantage of 
having high vapor emissions and high viscosities resulting 
in environmental contamination and low toner particle 
mobility which retards image quality.  It has been found that the above disadvantages can be 
overcome and improved developers prepared by using a 
nonpolar liquid having a narrow boiling point range. In accordance with this invention there is provided an 
electrostatic liquid developer consisting essentially of: 
(A) a nonpolar liquid having a Kauri-butanol value of 
less than 30, an average boiling point between 150°C and 
400°C, preferably between 225°C and 325°C, a boiling point 
range of less than 12°C, preferably less than 10°C, and a 
viscosity of less than 20 cps at 30°C; (B) thermoplastic resin particles having an average 
by area particle size of less than 10 µm, and (C) an ionic or zwitterionic charge director compound 
soluble in the nonpolar liquid (A). Throughout the specification the below-listed terms 
have the following meanings: In the claims appended hereto "consisting essentially 
of" means the composition of the electrostatic liquid 
developer does not exclude unspecified components which do 
not prevent the advantages of the developer from being 
realized. For example, in addition to the primary 
components, there can be present additional components,
