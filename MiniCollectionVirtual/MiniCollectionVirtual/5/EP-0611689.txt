<ABSTRACT>
The puschair is folded transversely, with the intermediate 
U-shaped portion (2) of the handlebar formed by two 

hinged portions and comprising a latch (48) locking it in 
the unfolded position thereof. The puschair is characterized 

in that the handlebar is formed by two rigid 
L-shaped members (2 and 3), the shorter arms of which are 

hingedly connected together (6), forming the intermediate 
portion of the handlebar, while the longer arms of said 

L-shaped members form the side limbs (4 and 5) of the 
handlebar, with the peculiarity that said side limbs are 

each formed by two mutually coaxially rotatable portions 
(4'), one of said portions, fixedly attached to the 

shorter arm, is provided with a spigot (105) on which the 
puschair unfolding locking latch (56) is hooked, said 

latch being mounted on each front leg (8 and 9) of the 
chair and on which the corresponding handlebar side limb 

(4 and 5) may slide.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for locking and 
releasing the folded position of children's pushchairs. This device is appropriate for children's pushchairs 
which fold transversally and when being folded the U-shaped 
handlebar slides over the front legs of the 
pushchair. Such pushchairs have the intermediate portion of the 
handlebar hinged in the middle, where there is a latch 
locking them in the unfolded state thereof. Between the 
side limbs of the handlebar and the front legs there are 
respective latches locking the pushchair in the unfolded 
state thereof. The present applicants are owners of ES-A-9200976 
relating to a folding chassis for children's pushchairs, 
which is folded as indicated above. When the pushchairs of this type have to be folded by the 
person out with the child, certain difficulties are 
encountered in that three latches have to be operated, 
namely the handlebar latch and the latches on each side 
of the chassis and generally only one hand is free, since 
the child has to be held with the other hand. The present device has been devised to simplify the 
operation of releasing the pushchair latches, whereby by 
performing a single operation on the handlebar latch, 
both this and the side latches are released. With a view to ensuring that the unfolded position of the 
pushchair does not become unsafe as a result of the  
 
elimination of the direct releasing controls for the side 
latches, according to the invention the handlebar joint 
has been provided with a safety device which may be 
manually released in the same operation as in which the 
latch is released. It is a feature that the handlebar is formed by two L-shaped 
members, the shorter arms of which are hingedly 
connected together, forming the intermediate portion of 
the handlebar, while the longer arms form the side limbs 
of the handlebar, with the peculiarity that said side 
limbs are formed by two mutually coaxially rotatable 
portions, one of which, fixedly attached to the shorter 
arm, is provided with a spigot on which the pushchair 
folding locking latch is hooked, the latch being mounted 
on the front legs of the chair. A further feature is that the handlebar joint, which is 
provided with a latch having a pushbutton which releases 
the handlebar on being depressed, in the position thereof 
corresponding to the unfolded state of the handlebar, is 
retained by a resilient safety device having a control 
for manual operation and allowing the said joint to be 
released. With this device, when the two

<CLAIMS>
1.- A device for locking and releasing the folded 
position of children's pushchairs, which folding is 

effected transversally and for which the intermediate U-shaped 
portion (1) of the handlebar is hinged and 

comprises a latch (118) locking it in the unfolded 
position thereof, characterized in that the handlebar is 

formed by two L-shaped members (2 and 3), the shorter 
arms of the L being hingedly connected together (6), 

forming the intermediate portion of the handlebar, while 
the longer arms of said L-shaped members form the side 

limbs (4 and 5) of the handlebar, with the peculiarity 
that said side limbs are formed by two mutually coaxially 

rotatable portions (4'), one of said side limbs (4 and 5) 
fixedly attached to the shorter arm, is provided with a 

spigot (105) on which the pushchair unfolding locking 
latch (56) is hooked, said latch being mounted on each 

front leg (8 and 9) of the pushchair and on which the 
corresponding handlebar side limb (4 and 5) may slide. 
2.- The device for locking and releasing the folded 
position of children's pushchairs of claim 1, in which 

the hinged handlebar latch (48) comprises a pushbutton 
(55) for the release thereof, characterized in that the 

joint (6) in the position thereof corresponding to the 
unfolded handlebar, is locked by a safety device (109) 

resiliently urged (111) and having a control (114) for 
manual operation thereof allowing the joint (6) to be 

released. 
3.- The device for locking and releasing the folded 
position of children's pushchairs of claim 1, in which 

with the mutual rotation of the shorter arms there is 
obtained the coaxial rotation of the portion of the side 

limbs (4 and 5) of the handlebar fixedly attached to said 
 

shorter arms and therewith the release of the spigots 
(105) of said side limbs from the retaining latches (56) 

mounted on the front legs (8 and 9), thereby allowing 
full folding of the pushchair. 
4.- The device for locking and releasing the folded 
position of children's pushchairs of claim 2, in which 

the latch (48') and the safety device (109) provided on 
the handlebar are slidingly operated in opposite 

directions urged by respective springs (111' and 111) and 
have respective bolts (110' and 110) inserted in 

respective bolt eyes (112' and 112) corresponding to the 
jointed ends (54 and 51) of the centre division of the 

handlebar.
