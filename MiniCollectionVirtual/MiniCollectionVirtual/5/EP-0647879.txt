<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a silver halide photographic material,
more particularly to a silver halide photographic material having improved
antistatic property and improved coating ability.Silver halide photographic materials are generally composed of an
electrically insulating support and photographic layers coated thereon. Such a
structure promotes the formation and accumulation of static charges when subjecting
the photographic materials to friction or separation, caused by contact
with the surface of the same or different materials during steps for
manufacturing of the photographic materials or when using them for
photographic purposes. These accumulated static charges cause several
drawbacks. The most serious drawback is discharge of accumulated charges
prior to development processing, by which the light-sensitive silver halide
emulsion layer is exposed to light to form dot spots or branched or feathery
linear specks when development of the photographic film is carried out. This is
the phenomenon of the so-called "static marks". Such static marks cause a
reduction of the commercial value of photographic films, which sometimes
become completely useless. For example, the formation of static marks in
medical or industrial X-ray films may result in a very dangerous judgment or
erroneous diagnosis. Static marks are a particular problem because it becomes
evident for the first time by carrying out development. Further, these static charges
are also the origin of secondary problems such as adhesion of dusts to the
surface of films, uneven coating, and the like.As mentioned above, such static charge are frequently accumulated when
manufacturing and/or using silver halide photographic materials. For example,
during production, they are generated by friction of the photographic film 
contacting a roller or by separation of the emulsion surface from the support
surface during a rolling or unrolling step. Further, they are generated on X-ray
films in an automatic apparatus by contact with or separating from mechanical
parts or fluorescent screens, or they are generated by contact with or separation
from rollers and bars made of rubber, metal, or plastics in a bonding machine or
an automatic developing machine or an automatic developing apparatus or in a
camera in the case of using color negative films or color reversal films. In
addition they can be generated by contacting with packing materials, and the
like.Silver halide photographic materials having high sensitivity and handling
speed are subject to
