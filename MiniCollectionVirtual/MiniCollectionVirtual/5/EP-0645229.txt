<CLAIMS>
A method of continuously manufacturing moulded articles from 
chemically hardenable and foamable phenol resol resin mixtures, 

characterised in that the resin formulation is mixed by means of a 
twin-screw extruder. 
A method according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
moulded articles are shaped in a twin-belt press.
