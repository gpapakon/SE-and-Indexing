<ABSTRACT>
A cooling system for an automotive vehicle is 
disclosed including a heat exchanger assembly (16), a 

rotatable axial flow fan (22) and a shroud member (24) at 
least partially surrounding the fan (22) and the heat 

exchanger assembly (16). The cooling system further 
includes a first ejector (36) disposed between the heat 

exchanger and the engine (12) for drawing ambient air from 
under the heat exchanger (16) and pumping the air toward the 

engine (12) and for preventing recirculation of the air 
exiting the shroud member (24) back to the fan (22) while 

the vehicle is at idle.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a cooling
system for cooling an engine of an automotive vehicle. More
particularly, the present invention relates to an ejector
system used in an automotive cooling system which
substantially reduces recirculation of air into the fan of
the cooling system.Most vehicles used today are propelled by internal
combustion engines and such engines, as is well known,
generate heat during their operation. For the most part,
the internal combustion engines employed commercially are of
the liquid-cooled type which employs the circulation of a
coolant through the engine for absorbing heat. The correct
operating temperature of the engine is maintained by
subsequently passing, under pressure, the heated coolant
received from the engine through a heat exchanger system and
returning the coolant to the engine for recirculation
therein. Generally, the heat exchange system employed
includes a heat exchanger or a radiator and condenser
assembly through which the heated coolant received from the
engine flows. Simultaneously, the fan disposed between the
radiator and the engine draws ambient air through the
radiator which absorbs the heat from the heated coolant and
carries it to the atmosphere. In most vehicle applications,
the air stream formed by the fan is discharged back over the
engine after passing through the radiator. This engine fan
exhaust impinges on the engine block of the vehicle engine
and is turned approximately 90° downward. This hot exhaust
air then impacts the ground and a portion of the fan exhaust
is redirected toward the front of the vehicle where the hot
air flow is subsequently reingested into the front-end air
stream. This recirculation results in increased engine
coolant air inlet temperatures and subsequently increased
air conditioning head pressure. This is particularly a
problem when the vehicle is at idle in hot regions. Various devices have been proposed to reduce or eliminate
the hot air recirculating back to the front end intake of
the vehicle. For example, U.S. Patent No. 4 173 995
discloses a recirculation barrier for a heat transfer system
for an automotive vehicle. The patent teaches eliminating
air flow recirculation in the fan shroud-hub region of the
vehicle by contouring the fan shroud and installing a
deflection plate which turns the flow of air from an axial
to a radial direction, thereby reducing the amount of air
flow recirculating in the fan shroud region. By reducing the
amount of recirculation in the fan shroud, the fan operates
more
