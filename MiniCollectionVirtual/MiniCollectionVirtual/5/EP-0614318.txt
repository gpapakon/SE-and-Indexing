efficiency even at a low bit rate is provided. The 

apparatus comprises a moving object analyzer 2 which 
extracts a moving part from an input picture signal, 

analyzes its motion and outputs a residual signal 
relative to a reconstruction image and motion parameters, 

a residue coding means 4 for coding the residual 
signal, a reconstruction means 3 for reconstructing 

a picture using the motion parameters and residual 
coded information and a variable length coding means 5 

which performs a variable length coding of the motion

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to video encoding and
decoding apparatus for use in video motion compensated
interframe predictive coding.The video encoding technology has been utilised in
the following picture communication, broadcasting and
storage applications;
(i) Transmission of still pictures, for
example in facsimile telegraphy, at the highest
possible speed through picture coding;(ii) Transmission of motion pictures in video
conferencing, videophone and other fields within the
narrowest possible band and/or the lowest possible bit
rate by the utilisation of picture coding;(iii) Recording of picture information in a
disk or memory for the most efficient storage of as
much image data as possible through picture coding.A block diagram of a conventional video encoder is
presented in Fig. 16.As shown, an input picture signal is divided into
a plurality of blocks and a motion vector indicating
the motion relative to the picture of the preceding
frame is estimated on a block-by-block basis. Using
this motion vector, the preceding frame picture is
subjected to motion compensation and the difference
from the input picture is extracted. This differential
signal is subjected to discrete cosine transform (DCT)
quantization and variable length coding and, then,
outputted.As suggested by the use of DCT, the conventional
transform encoder employs a single transform routine
(transform matrix) on the assumption that the video 
image is stationary. Moreover, even in the variable
matrix adaptive Karhunen-Loeve (KL) transform coding
apparatus employing a plurality of transform matrices
which are selectively accessed, technologies with poor
operational efficiencies such as the method involving a
total search for selecting one transform matrix for a
fixed quantisation procedure have been explored and
there has been no optimal coding apparatus for video
information. Furthermore, as the technology for
selecting the optimum transform from among a plurality
of available KL transforms, the technique using
distances in the auto-correlation matrix space of the
input signal and the technique assuming the perpetual
existence of directionality in images have been
available but since these techniques are not optimal
from the standpoint of minimizing the coding error a
degradation of coding performance has been inevitable.Meanwhile, even when the optimum transform could
be selected in the conventional video coding apparatus
illustrated in Fig. 16, motion compensations had to be
invariably carried out by parallel shifting with
