<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a coupling (1) of at least two conduits 
(3,4) provided with an insulating jacket (5), comprising a joint between 

the two conduits (3,4) with connecting, exposed conduit portions and a 
form-retaining, insulating cap (15) which encloses the joint, the 

exposed conduit portions (3,4) and adjacent conduit jacket portions (5).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a coupling of at least 
two conduits provided with an insulating wall and to a cap 
for such a coupling. During coupling of conduits provided with an insulating 
jacket a portion of the jacket is removed, whereafter, in the 
case of metal conduits portions, these conduit portions are 
welded to each other. A drawback to the use of for instance a 
copper-silver solder joint is that for a period of time 
(about one month) the formed joint has insufficient rigidity. 
Relative movements between the conduits can lead to 
deformation and even to leakage. When one or both conduit portions consist of plastic, 
it is recommended for obtaining a reliable joint that a 
relative movement between the conduits at the position of the 
joint is permanently eliminated. The invention has for its object to provide a coupling 
for such conduits provided with an insulating jacket, wherein 
after forming of the connection a relative displacement 
between the conduits at the position of the joint is excluded 
and in addition the insulating properties not only remain the 
same but are preferably improved. This is achieved according to the invention by a 
coupling according to the invention which is provided with at 
least two conduits provided with an insulating jacket, 
comprising a joint between the two conduits with connecting, 
exposed conduit portions and a form-retaining, insulating cap 
which encloses the joint, the exposed conduit portions and 
adjacent conduit jacket portions. Because the cap fixes the 
connected conduits therein substantially without movement and 
the cap itself is form-retaining, the relative movement 
between the conduits thereby becomes impossible. Although the cap can be formed around the conduits at 
the position of the joint, it is recommended that the cap is  
 
constructed from two cap parts, whereby the joint remains 
accessible at all times. The production cost of the cap, for 
example by injection moulding, is greatly reduced if more 
preferably the cap parts have substantially the same form. An 
optimal fixation of the conduits in the cap is realized when 
the cap is provided with a cap cavity receiving a conduit 
jacket, a cavity wall of which is provided with a clamping 
profile. An optimally insulated and water-sealing coupling is 
obtained when in further preference the cap parts are 
provided along the periphery of their contact surface with 
complementary coupling elements. A rapid and guaranteed fixing of the cap parts is 
obtained if more
