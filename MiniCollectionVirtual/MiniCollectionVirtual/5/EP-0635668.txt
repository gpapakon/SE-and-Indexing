<ABSTRACT>
A device for connecting a user to a source of medical 
gas or a vacuum source, comprises a connecting box (1) to be 

connected to the gas source (4) and having a closing valve (10), and a 
connecting element (5) to be connected with the user and having a 

connecting nipple (7) insertable in a connecting opening (9) of the 
connecting box (1). This connecting nipple (7) is slidable within the 

connecting opening (9) in axial direction between a parking 
position and a further inserted working position, wherein the 

closing valve (10) is opened in the working position only. The 
connecting nipple (7) includes a collar (8) and the connecting opening 

(9) includes first (13) and second (23) locking elements adapted to 
engage 

the collar (8) of the connecting nipple (9) to lock the connecting 
element (5) in the connecting box (1) in a parking position and a 

working position, respectively. The connecting box (1) is further 
provided with a manually operable actuating means (19) for 

releasing the locking (13) of the connecting element (5) in the 
connecting box (1). When releasing the locking (13) of the connecting 

element (5) in the working position, the actuating means (19) activates 
locking means (23) for blocking the connecting element (5) in the 

parking position, so that the connecting element (5) cannot shoot 
fully out of the connecting box (1) unintentionally.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device in accordance with 
the preamble of appended claim 1. A device of this kind is known from FR-A-2 074 163. 
In the known device of this type the connecting element is 
coupled with the connecting box by inserting the connecting 
nipple in axial direction into the connecting opening. In this 
case the connecting element first arrives in a parking position 
and is locked in this parking position in that the second 
locking elements engage the collar of the connecting nipple 
and hold the connecting element. The closing valve remains 
closed in this parking position so that no gas or vacuum is 
provided to the user. When the connecting element with the 
connecting nipple is pressed further into the connecting opening, 
the connecting element arrives in the working position 
in which the closing valve is opened so that the user is connected 
to the gas source or vacuum source. The connecting element 
is locked in the working position in that the first locking 
means now engage the collar of the connecting nipple. 
When one wishes to disengage the user from the gas source or 
vacuum source, the actuating means is operated to release the 
locking of the connecting element in the connecting box. Pushing 
the actuating means forwards from the locked working position 
releases both the first and the second locking elements, 
but actuates a separate set of locking elements to prevent 
the connecting element shooting out. Release of the actuating 
means then releases this extra set of locking elements 
but re-locks the second locking elements to hold the connector 
in the final parking position. The actuating means must be 
operated a second time to allow removal of the connecting element. The invention aims to provide a device of the above-mentioned 
type wherein it is realized in a more simple manner 
that at operating the actuating means for releasing the locking, 
the connecting element cannot be forced fully out of the  
 
connecting box unintentionally. To this end the device according to the invention is 
characterized in accordance with the characterizing portion of 
claim 1. In this manner it is obtained that at releasing the 
locking of the connecting element in the working position, the 
connecting element will be blocked in the non-working position 
with certainty.  
 The invention will be further explained hereinafter 
by reference to the drawings in which an embodiment of the 
device according to the invention is schematically shown. Fig. 1 shows schematically an
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Device for connecting a user to a source of 
medical gas or a vacuum source, comprising a connecting box 

(1) to be connected to the gas source and having a closing 
valve (10), and a connecting element (5) to be connected with 

the user and having a connecting nipple (7) insertable in a 
connecting opening (9) of the connecting box and slidable within 

the connecting opening in axial direction between a parking 
position and a further inserted working position, wherein 

the closing valve is opened in the working position only, wherein 
the connecting nipple includes a collar (8) and the connecting 

opening includes first and second locking elements 
(13; 23) adapted to engage the collar of the connecting nipple 

to lock the connecting element in the connecting box in a non-working 
position and a working position, respectively, and 

wherein the connecting box is provided with a manually operable 
actuating means (19) for releasing the locking of the connecting 

element in the connecting box, 
characterized
 in that 
the actuating means (19) when releasing the locking of the 

connecting element (5) in the working position, activates locking 
means for blocking the connecting element (5) in the non-working 

position in that the second locking elements (23) are 
maintained in engagement with the collar (8) of the connecting 

nipple (7) in the non-working position by a spring (25) and 
during pulling the locking nipple outwardly are movable 

radially outwardly against the spring action, wherein the 
actuating means (19) when releasing the locking of the connecting 

element (5) in the working position, blocks the radial 
movement of the second locking elements (23). 
Device according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that 
the second locking elements (23) also function as said locking 

means.  
 
Device according to claim 2, 
characterized
 in that 
the first and second locking elements (13; 23) are received in 

a blocking ring (14) located in a substantially cylindrical 
coupling body (15), wherein the blocking ring (14) and the 

cylindrical coupling body (15) are mutually slidable in axial 
direction by means of the actuating means (19), wherein the 

first locking elements (13) are movable in radial direction 
away from the collar (8) into a recess (18) in the cylindrical 

body (15) only at operating the actuating means (19) for releasing 
the locking. 
Device according to claim 3, 
characterized
 in that 
blocking ring (14) is pressed into a working position by a 

spring (16), in which working position the first locking elements 
(13) are not radially movable, wherein by cooperation 

between the collar (8) of the connecting nipple (7) and the 
second and first locking elements (13; 23), respectively, the 

ring (14) is axially movable against the action of the spring 
(16) for radially moving the second and first locking elements 

(13; 23), respectively, into the recess (18) in the cylindrical 
body (15). 
Device according to any one of the preceding 
claims, 
characterized
 in that the first and second locking 
elements (13; 23) each comprise a plurality of balls or the
