<DESCRIPTION>
 PEROXYACID BLEACH PRECURSOR COMPOSITIONSTechnical FieldThis invention relates to solid peroxy acid bleach precursor compositions and especially to particulate detergent compositions incorporating inorganic perhydrate bleaches together with N- or O- acyl group - containing peroxycarboxylic acid bleach precursors (so-called bleach activators) .Background of the InventionBleach precursor compositions have come into widespread use in recent years as heavy duty fabric cleaning products, particularly in automatic washing machines. The growth in usage of bleach activators has mirrored a decrease in fabric wash temperatures which itself has accompanied an increase in the proportion of fabrics that are coloured.One problem that has become more significant as a result of these trends is that of damage to fabric colours and materials caused by the development of localised high 

concentrations of bleaching species. High bleach concentrations can arise around any particulate bleaching species for several reasons. The bleaching species may itself have an intrinsically low solubility, its solubility may have been hindered by the presence of other materials such as viscous surfactant phases or the agitation regime in the immediate environment of the bleach species may not be high enough to disperse the dissolved bleach. Where a bleach activator forms a component of the composition the potential problem is increased. In addition to the potential for localised high concentrations of perhydroxyl ion arising from dissolution of the inorganic perhydrate normally contained in laundry detergent compositions, the perhydrolysis of the bleach activator to form peroxycarboxyl anions can give rise to significant localised peroxycarboxylate bleach concentrations.The development of so-called concentrated products and their delivery via dispensing devices placed in the machine drum together with the fabric load has merely served to exacerbate these problems. Accordingly a need exists to provide detergent compositions in which the bleach activator is incorporated in a form that minimises and preferably eliminates damage to fabric colours and materials during its dissolution and perhydrolysis in the wash liquor.The prior art contains numerous examples of bleach activators coated or agglomerated so as to increase their stability on storage in detergent compositions and/or to influence their solution behaviour.EP-A-0070474 discloses granulate bleach activators prepared by spray drying an aqueous pumpable dispersion containing an N-acyl
