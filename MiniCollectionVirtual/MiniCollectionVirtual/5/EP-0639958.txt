<ABSTRACT>
A radially self-expanding stent (90) particularly suited for treating esophageal strictures, includes a medial region (92) and proximal and distal cuffs (94, 96) having diameters greater than the medial region (92) diameter when the stent (90) is in the relaxed state. A silicone coating circumscribes the medial region (92), but the cuffs (94, 96) are not coated and retain their open weave construction. As a result, the cuffs (94, 96) remain particularly well suited to immediately contact esophageal wall tissue and resist stent migration, while the silicone coated medial region (92) provides a barrier to tumor ingrowth, and has an enhanced radial restoring force to maintain an open passageway in the esophagus. A deployment device (16) for the stent (90) includes an interior catheter (26) surrounded by the stent (90) and having an esophageal dilation feature (28), along with an exterior catheter (18) that radially compresses the stent (90). A low durometer sleeve (54), fixed to the interior tube (26) and in surface engagement with the compressed stent (90), tends to fix the axial position of the stent (90) relative to the interior catheter (26) whenever the exterior catheter (18) is moved axially relative to the inner catheter (26). Consequently, precision in stent placement and the ability to recapture a partially deployed stent are enhanced.

<DESCRIPTION>
 ESOPHAGEAL STENT AND DELIVERY TOOLBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to body implantable treatment devices, and more particularly to stents and other prostheses intended for fixation in body lumens especially including the esophagus-.Carcinomas in the esophagus lead to progressive dysphagia, i.e. difficulty in swallowing, and the inability to swallow liquids in the most severe cases. While surgical removal is sometimes effective, the majority of patients have tumors that can not be surgically removed. Repeated dilations of the esophagus provide onlyNtemporary relief.Difficult or refractory cases often are treated by intubation using rigid plastic prostheses, or laser therapy with an Nd:YAG laser. These techniques, while often effective, have disadvantages. Rigid plastic protheses are large, for example having a diameter of 10-12 mm and larger (25-29 mm) outer end flanges. Placement of rigid plastic stents is traumatic, and too frequently causes perforation of the esophageal wall. These protheses further are subject to migration, obstruction with food or tumor ingrowth, and late pressure necrosis.Laser therapy is expensive, typically requiring several treatment sessions. Tumor recurrence is frequent, in the range of 30-40 percent. Submucosal tumors, and certain pulmonary and breast tumors causing dysphagia by esophageal compression, can not be treated by laser therapy.The search for a more suitable prosthesis has lead to experiments with Gianturco stents, also known as Z-stents. U.S. Patent No. 4,800,882 (Gianturco) 

describes such a device employed as an endovascular stent. Such stents for the esophagus have been constructed of 0.018 inch stainless steel wire, and provided with a silicone cover to inhibit tumor ingrowth. It was found necessary, however, to provide a distal silicone bumper to prevent trauma to the esophageal mucosa.Self-expanding mesh stents also have been considered for use as esophageal prostheses. U.S. Patent No. 4,655,771 (Wallsten) discloses a mesh stent as a flexible tubular braided structure formed of helically wound thread elements. Mesh stents appear unlikely to lead to pressure necrosis of the esophageal wall. With its inherent pliability the mesh stent, as compared to a rigid plastic stent, is insertable with much less trauma to the patient. Further, the stent can mold itself to and firmly fix itself against the esophageal wall, to resist migration. However, the stent is subject to tumor ingrowth because of the spaces between adjacent ilaments.A

CLAIMS 1. An apparatus (16) for deploying a radially self-expanding stent (66) within a body lumen, including: a stent confining means (18) for elastically compressing a radially self-expanding stent (66) into a delivery configuration in which the self-expanding stent (66) has a reduced radius along its entire axial length; an elongate and flexible stent delivery device (26) having a proximal end, a distal end and a distal region near the distal end for use in delivering the radially self-expanding stent (66) into a body lumen and in positioning the stent (66) at a treatment site within the body lumen with the stent (66) surrounding the delivery device (26) along the distal region, while the proximal end of the flexible delivery device (26) remains outside of the body; an axial restraining means (54) disposed along the distal region of the delivery device (26) ; and a control means (24, 40) operably associated with the delivery device (26) and the confining means (18) , for moving the confining means (18) axially relative to the delivery device (26) toward and away from a confinement position in which the confining means (18) compresses the self- expanding stent (66) into the delivery configuration and urges the stent (66) into a surface engagement with the axial restraining means (54) ; wherein the axial restraining means (54) , due to said surface engagement, tends to maintain the self-expanding stent (66) axially aligned with the 


deployment device (16) as the confining means (18) is moved axially away from the confinement position to release the stent (66) for radial self-expansion.
2. The apparatus of Claim 1 wherein: the stent delivery device (26) comprises a first elongate and flexible length of tubing (26) .
3. The apparatus of Claim 2 further including: a central lumen (42) running the axial length of the first tubing (26) , for accommodating a guidewire (44) .
