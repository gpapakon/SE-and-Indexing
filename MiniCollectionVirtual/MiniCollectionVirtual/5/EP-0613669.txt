<ABSTRACT>
A process for making an adhesive dressing comprises continuously 
feeding a strip (24) having at least portions which are absorbent, 

through an adhesive application zone (40). An adhesive is applied to 
one side of the strip in such a fashion that the adhesive coated 

strip has at least one absorbent pad area (30). The adhesive coated 
strip is fed directly and continuously to a release paper 

application zone (60) in which release paper is applied over the 
adhesive adjacent the absorbent pad area, to form a continuous 

adhesive dressing.

<DESCRIPTION>
THIS INVENTION relates to a process for making an adhesive 
dressing. According to the invention, there is provided a process for 
making an adhesive dressing, which comprises
 
   continuously feeding a strip having at least portions which 
are absorbent, through an adhesive application zone;
 
   applying an adhesive to one side of the strip in such a 
fashion that the adhesive coated strip has at least one absorbent 
pad area; and
 
   feeding the adhesive coated strip directly and continuously 
to a release paper application zone in which release paper is 
applied over the adhesive adjacent the absorbent pad area, to 
form a continuous adhesive dressing. While in principle a strip having only portions which are 
absorbent can be used, it is envisaged that the entire strip will 
normally be absorbent.  The process of the invention is characterized thereby that it is 
continuous, ie the strip passes continuously and directly from 
one zone to the next, without intermediate taking up thereof into 
a roll. The process is also characterized thereby that separate absorbent 
pads are not applied to the strip; the adhesive is applied in 
such a fashion that the adhesive coated strip has said at least 
one absorbent pad area which becomes the absorbent pad of 
individual dressings once the continuous dressing has been cut 
into individual dressings, as hereinafter described. Thus, the adhesive may be applied intermittently so that the 
absorbent pad area is defined by non-adhesive coated areas or 
portion of the strip. Instead, the adhesive may be coated 
continuously over the whole strip, so that the absorbent pad area 
is also coated with adhesive; however, the adhesive is then such 
that this zone will not adhere to a moist wound in use and will 
allow fluid absorbency, while the adhesive adjacent the absorbent 
pad area will adhere to dry skin adjacent such a moist wound, to 
secure the dressing in position. Examples of such adhesives are 
emulsion and hot melt acrylic adhesives which do not adhere to 
moist surfaces. The adhesive may be a pressure sensitive adhesive. It may be a 
curable adhesive such as a solvent based adhesive or an emulsion  
 
adhesive requiring only drying. Instead, however, it may be a 
hot melt adhesive. Thus, a single absorbent pad area, eg an absorbent pad area 
extending along the strip, may be provided. Instead, a plurality 
of the absorbent pad areas spaced longitudinally or laterally on 
the strip, may be provided. The absorbent strip may comprise a backing layer having an

A process for making an adhesive dressing, 
characterized in that it comprises 

   continuously feeding a strip having at least portions which 
are absorbent, through an adhesive application zone; 

   applying an adhesive to one side of the strip in such a 
fashion that the adhesive coated strip has at least one absorbent 

pad area; and 
   feeding the adhesive coated strip directly and continuously 

to a release paper application zone in which release paper is 
applied over the adhesive adjacent the absorbent pad area, to 

form a continuous adhesive dressing. 
A process according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the entire strip is absorbent, with the adhesive being applied 

intermittently so that the absorbent pad area is defined by non-adhesive 
coated areas of the strip. 
A process according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the entire strip is absorbent, with the adhesive being coated 

continuously over the whole strip, so that the absorbent pad area 
is also coated with adhesive, and with the adhesive being such 

that this zone will not adhere to a moist wound in use and will 
allow fluid absorbency, while the adhesive adjacent the absorbent 

pad area will adhere to dry skin adjacent such a moist wound, to 
secure the dressing in position. 
A process according to any one of Claims 1 to 3 
inclusive, characterized in that the absorbent strip comprises 

a backing layer having an absorbent layer thereon, with the 
process including passing the backing layer continuously through 

an absorbent strip forming zone ahead of the adhesive application 
zone, and applying the absorbent layer continuously to the 

backing layer in the strip forming zone. 
A process according to Claim 4, characterized in that 
the absorbent layer is an absorbent fabric. 
A process according to Claim 4, characterized in that 
the absorbent layer is of curable foam material, with the process 

including passing the strip from the strip forming zone through 
a curing zone ahead of the adhesive application zone, for curing 

of the foam material. 
A process according to any one of Claims 1 to 3 
inclusive, characterized in that the absorbent strip is of 

absorbent foamed material without a backing layer. 
A process according to Claim 7, characterized in that 
it includes forming the absorbent foamed strip continuously in 

a strip forming zone ahead of the adhesive application zone. 
A process according to Claim 8, characterized in that 
it includes passing the foamed strip from the strip forming zone 

 
through a curing zone where the foam is cured and stabilized, 

before passing it to the adhesive application zone. 
A process according to Claim 8, characterized in that 
the adhesive is a curable adhesive, with the process including 

passing the adhesive coated strip through a curing zone located 
after the adhesive application zone and in which the foam and 

adhesive are cured. 
A process according to any one of Claims 1 to 10 
inclusive, characterized in that it includes passing the 

continuous adhesive dressing from the release paper application 
zone to a cutting zone, and cutting it into individual dressings 

of a desired shape and size in the cutting zone. 
A process according to Claim 11, characterized in that 
the cutting is effected by means of a die cutting arrangement.
