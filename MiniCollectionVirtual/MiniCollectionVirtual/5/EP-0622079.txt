<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a βAP decomposing 
agent or a medicine for preventing and curing Alzheimer's 

disease, which contains, as the active ingredient, 
gelatinase A, a limited decomposate of gelatinase A, 

progelatinase A, a complex to which any of them has 
bonded or a material containing any of them. βAP is a 

substance which is considered to cause Alzheimer's 
disease.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an 
amyloid β-protein or A4 protein (βAP) 
decomposing agent. After formation of βAP, its aggregation causes the 
formation of senile plaques to be seen on the outside of 
neurocytes in the brain of a patient suffering from 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, the βAP decomposing 
agent of the present invention is expected to be useful 
also as a medicine for preventing and curing Alzheimer's 
disease. In general, Alzheimer's disease is a typical 
dementia, with which middle-aged or old-aged persons are 
often attacked, and this causes noticeable dysmnesia and 
retardation of mental capacity due to denaturation of 
neurons. Senile plaques appear on the outside of 
neurons in the brain of a patient suffering from 
Alzheimer's disease. Senile plaques consist essentially 
of βAP, in which it is seen that βAP aggregates by itself 
to form the cores of the plaques and denatured neuraxones 
surround the cores.  
 It has not been clarified as yet why βAP is 
produced to form senile plaques only in patients suffering 
from Alzheimer's disease. In fact, the formation of 
senile plaques is not seen in the aged with healthy mental 
capacity. It is known that βAP is derived from APP (amyloid 
protein precursor) which is a cell membrane protein having 
a molecular weight of about 100,000. APP is produced by an APP gene, which produces 
three major forms of related proteins (APP770, APP751, and 
APP695) due to the difference in the splicing. As one 
example, APP770 will be illustrated in the drawings 
attached hereto. Fig. 2 shows the outline structure of APP770, and 
its amino acid sequence (SEQ ID No. 1) is shown in Fig. 
1. In Fig. 2, 1 indicates the signal sequence from 
1 M (Met), and APP is comprised of 770 amino acids that are 
sequenced in order. 6 is a glycosylation domain where 
carbohydrate chains bond to the sequence at two sites, as 
shown by two CHO's in Fig. 2. In Fig. 2, the domain 8 
corresponds to the transmembrane region that has penetrated 
the plasma membrane.  
 When APP is cut at the site of D in Fig. 2(A) or, 
that is, at the arrowed site in the sequence of Fig. 2(D), 
it causes no disorder; but, in APP, if the part of D is 
closed to complete the domain 7 as one part (dark area) 
and the both sides of the domain 7 are cut, then APP 
liberates βAP (the whole domain 7). βAP is a mixture of 
peptides having the sequence comprising 1st to 39-43th amino 
acids. Fig. 3 shows the structure of βAP1-40. In healthy persons, APP is cut at its center part 
without
