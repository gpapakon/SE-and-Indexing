<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an optical satellite exchange for connecting up, to a telecommunication network, subscriber terminals emitting and receiving data in the form of cells, of fixed length, via asynchronous time-division multiplexing, including:     - a connection network (5) linked to a parent exchange;   -a control unit (8) linked to the connection network (5); - a plurality of concentrators (2, 7) linked to the connection network (5); - subscriber access circuits (1, 6) linked to the subscriber terminals and to the concentrators (2, 7) respectively.   The structure of the satellite exchange according to the invention is optimised for better utilisation of the optical components. Each concentrator (2, 7) includes means of spectral multiplexing of the cells received from subscriber terminals; and includes, downstream of the latter, means of phasing the multiplexed cells with respect to a local clock. The connection network (5) includes:   - means of interpreting a virtual circuit label or virtual beam label included in each cell emitted or received by the satellite exchange, and appending to it a routing label for routing this cell within this satellite exchange;   - means of producing a police function.   Application to asynchronous time-division multiplexed telecommunication networks.
