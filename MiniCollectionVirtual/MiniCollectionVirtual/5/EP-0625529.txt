<ABSTRACT>
A binder mixture for the production of paint (lacquer, enamel, varnish coatings it forms) which dry rapidly by physical means essentially comprising a) a polyisocyanate component having an NCO content of from 10 to 30 % by weight, and b) a hydroxy-functional polyacrylate component in amounts corresponding to an NCO/OH equivalent ratio of from 0.5:1 to 2:1, where component b) comprises at least one hydroxy-functional polyacrylate resin which has a molecular weight Mn of greater than 10,000 and whose 40 % strength by weight solution in n-butyl acetate has, at 23@C, a viscosity of at least 2,000 mPa.s, and the use of the binder mixture for solvent-containing two-component polyurethane coating compositions for the coating of wood or wood materials.

<CLAIMS>
Binder mixture for the production of rapidly
physically drying lacquer coatings from


a) a polyisocyanate component with an NCO content of
10 to 30 wt.%,

and
b) a hydroxy-functional polyacrylate component

in quantities corresponding to an NCO/OH equivalent
ratio of 0.5:1 to 2:1, 
characterised in that
 component
b) consists of at least one hydroxy-functional

polyacrylate resin with a molecular weight M
n
 of at
least 10,000, a 40 wt.% solution of which in n-butyl

acetate has a viscosity, measured to DIN 53019 part 1,
of at least 2,000 mPa.s at 23°C, wherein the

polyisocyanate component a) consists of at least one
polyisocyanate comprising biuret, urethane or

isocyanurate groups and derived from hexamethylene
diisocyanate and/or IPDI and having an average NCO

functionality of between 2.5 and 6, and component b)
