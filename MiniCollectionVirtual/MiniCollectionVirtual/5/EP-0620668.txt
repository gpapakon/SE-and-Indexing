<ABSTRACT>
A receiver for trellis coded QAM signals includes processing 
apparatus for removing +/- 90째 and 180째 phase errors. The Viterbi decoder 

(36) provides synchronisation control signals (S1), which are used to 
control the deinterleaving to remove 180째 errors, and, if necessary, to 

replace the I/Q axes with Q/-I axes, to remove +/- 90째 errors.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system for
restoring multi level/phase modulation data for use in a
digital transmission system, and more particularly, to a
method for restoring multi level/phase modulation data to
further improve reliability of data restoration by
correcting a phase error which is produced in demodulation
data, and apparatus therefor.A general digital transmission system should perform
data transmission having predetermined transmission
velocity and reliability even if a transmission channel is
in an inferior condition. To do so, the data transmission
system adopts an error correcting coding/decoding method,
and recently a Trellis coded modulation (hereinafter,
abbreviated as TCM) method. The TCM method combines a
data modulation with an error correction codification, and
improves a coding gain as bandwidth of the transmission
data is increased. Since the TCM technology is already
known in the digital communication field, the detailed
description thereof will be omitted. To improve a data
transmission capability, an interleaving and
deinterleaving method is also used in the digital
transmission system.Figure 1 shows an example of a conventional prior art
apparatus for restoring multi level/phase modulation data.
The Figure 1 apparatus shows a circuit for receiving the
data intended to be transmitted which is interleaved, Reed
Solomon (RS) coded and Trellis coded in the transmitting
end to then be modulated and transmitted, demodulating the
received data and restoring the demodulated data into the
original data. In Figure 1, an I-axis data being in-phase
demodulated in a demodulator (not shown) and a Q-axis data
being quadrature-phase are input through two input ports
11 and 12, respectively. Since the respective I-axis and
Q-axis data has been interleaved, a deinterleaver 13
deinterleaves the respective I-axis and Q-axis data based
on a predetermined sync position and outputs the
deinterleaved data. The I-axis and Q-axis data output
from deinterleaver 13 is Trellis-decoded in a Trellis
decoder 14. Here, Trellis decoder 14 discriminates
whether the Trellis-decoded data is synchronised. For
such a sync discrimination, a Viterbi algorithm is used.
Trellis decoder 14 repetitively performs a process of
selecting a path where a Hamming distance is shortest
among paths which the data input to the respective state
at a Trellis diagram, to find a path having the minimum
Hamming distance. Then, if a cumulative distance of the
found path is larger than a predetermined reference value,
