<ABSTRACT>
A cross connect system for telecommunication wires reduces the required time to install and effect cross connections if the wire connections are made by hand and changes are made between circuits by unplugging a modular plug and plugging it in at a different position. The connector of the present invention has a terminal block accepting a plurality of plugs connected each to a pair of wires and the plugs fit onto the terminal block or can be stacked on each other for half tapping, testing or transferring. Protected plugs may be provided having overvoltage protection circuits, and jumper plugs may be stacked onto such protected plugs.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electrical connectors 
and more specifically to a device for connecting a first pair of wires to a second pair of wires for use 
in telecommunications systems for connecting wire pairs, 
the tip and the ring, from a central office to wire pairs 
from a distribution cable. The cross connect terminal of 
the present invention includes a plurality of overvoltage 
protection circuits for protecting the connected pairs 
from, e.g., lightning strikes. Cross connect blocks have been known and used 
in the telecommunications industry for the purpose of 
terminating central office cables and matching pairs 
therefrom with pairs in distribution lines to 
subscribers. At the point where a cross connect block is 
used, a large cable from the central office is generally 
terminated. At this station smaller distribution cables 
are also connected to cross connect blocks mounted in 
juxtaposition to the other cross connect blocks 
permitting the matching of wire pairs of the central 
office cable with the correct pair to a subscriber. 
The cross connect blocks permit changes in the phone 
circuits to be made, they permit tests of the circuits to 
be made, and transfers can be made. In some 
installations, the cross connect block permits additional 
phones to be connected to a given line pair. Examples of the existing cross connect blocks  
 
include U.S.-A-4,210,378 which uses a screw type 
binding post to make the connection between one pair of 
wires and another. One connection is generally a 
permanent connection to the block. Improvements on this 
product to make quicker and faster connections are 
described in U.S.-A-4,431,247 and US-A-4,815,988. 
Other examples of a different style of cross connect 
blocks are illustrated in U.S.-A-4,279,460 and US-A-4,789,354. 
In each of these examples, wire pairs from 
one line can readily be joined to wire pairs in an 
adjacent cross connect block by running wires between the 
contact elements of the two blocks. In addition to these prior teachings of cross 
connect blocks and systems of cross connection, the art 
is replete with documents related to insulation 
displacement connectors such as U.S.-A-4,341,430, 
4,533,196 and U.K.-A-2,129,630. These references 
show varying types of telecommunication or electrical 
connectors wherein the wire is directed into a U-slot in 
a metal contact element and the contact element displaces 
the insulation to make resilient pressure contact against 
the conductor and make electrical connection therewith.

<CLAIMS>
A device for connecting a first pair of wires to a second 
pair of wires, comprising: 


a terminal block (16) including a base (21) having 
means (25,26) for supporting the first pair of wires 

(23), and a cover (18) adapted to fit on said base 
(21), said cover (18) having a pair of terminal contacts 

(30) for making connection to the first pair of 
wires (23) and a pair of apertures (35) affording 

access to said terminal contacts (30); and 
a plug (20,80) comprising: 

an electrically insulative body (40;82) having 
first and second ends, said body (40;82) having 

therein a pair of contacts (45) electrically 
protected against an overvoltage, each contact (45) 

having a first end portion (50;84) located at said 
first end of said body (40;82), being adapted to 

make electrical connection with one of said terminal 
contacts (30), and a second end portion (51, 

52;86) located at said second end of said body (40; 
82), being adapted to make electrical connection 

with one of the second pair of wires, 
an insulative cap (41;81) hingedly attached to said 
second end of said body (40;82) and 
means (85,87,88,89) for providing electrical overvoltage 
protection to said contacts (45). 
The device of claim 1 wherein said means (85,87,88,89) 
for providing electrical overvoltage protection includes: 


an electrically conductive grounding bar (89) attached 
to said terminal block (16);  

 
means for limiting the voltage (87) passing through 
said contacts (45); and 
means (85,88) for connecting said voltage limiting 
means (87) to said grounding bar (89). 
The device of claim 1 or 2, wherein: 

said cover (18) further has location means (37,38) 
about said aperture (35) for polarizing said apertures 

(35); and 
said first end of said body (40;82) further has means 
(55) for mating with said location means (37,38) and 

for positioning said first end portions of said contacts 
(45) in said apertures (35) to make electrical 

contact with said terminal contacts (30). 
The device of any one of claims 1 to 3 wherein said cap 
(41;81) has means (53) for facilitating connection between 

each of the second pair of wires and each of said 
second end portions (51,52;86) of said contacts (45), 

respectively, as said cap (41;81) is moved from an open 
position to a closed position.
