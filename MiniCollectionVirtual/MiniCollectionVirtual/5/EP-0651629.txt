<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to absorbent articles such as
diapers, sanitary napkins, panty liners, and incontinence pads.
More particularly, the present invention relates to absorbent
articles, such as sanitary napkins, that are extensible which are
provided with less extensible lips that serve as barriers to the
flow of liquids.Absorbent articles such as sanitary napkins, pantiliners, and
incontinence pads are devices that are typically worn in the
crotch region of an undergarment. These devices are designed to
absorb and retain liquid and other discharges from the human body
and to prevent body and clothing soiling. Improving the
performance of such absorbent articles, particularly the leakage
performance of the same, continues to be a formidable undertaking,
although a number of improvements have been made in both their
materials and structures.For instance, disposable absorbent articles have previously
been provided with elastic members to improve the side leakage
performance of such products. For example, U.S. Patent 3,860,003,
issued to Buell on January 14, 1975, discloses elasticized
disposable absorbent articles wherein an elastic member is
positioned in the side flap of the product between the topsheet 
and the backsheet. The side flap is gathered by the elastic
member such that a boat-like configuration for the pad is
presented and the side flaps form a barrier along the edges of the
product.U.S. Patent 4,738,677 issued to Foreman entitled "Absorbent
Article Having A Containment Pocket", discloses another type of
barrier to the flow of liquids which comprises a first set of
barrier cuffs along the longitudinal edges of the absorbent
article and a second set of barrier cuffs along the end edges of
the absorbent article. The barrier cuffs overlap at corner points
to form a containment pocket. The first set of barrier cuffs are
provided with a spacing means, such as an elastic member, which
spaces both sets of barrier cuffs away from the liquid-receiving
surface of the absorbent article.Typically, most of the disposable absorbent articles of the
types mentioned above (that is, sanitary napkins, panty liners,
and incontinence pads) are made of materials that will not
stretch. That is, the materials (and the article itself) will not
stretch under the forces that the absorbent article is normally
subjected to when worn. Recently, however, efforts have been
directed toward providing extensible absorbent articles for
improved comfort and conformity with the wearer's body and
undergarments (if the

<CLAIMS>
An absorbent article (20) having a longitudinal centerline L
extending in a longitudinal direction, a transverse

centerline T extending in a transverse direction, a pair of
longitudinal side edges (22) and a pair of end edges (24) which form

the periphery (26) of the absorbent article (20), said absorbent
article (20) comprising:


a liquid pervious topsheet (38);
a liquid impervious backsheet (40) joined to said topsheet (38);
an absorbent core (42) positioned between said topsheet (38) and said
backsheet (40); and
a barrier (44) adjacent at least one of the longitudinal side
edges (22) of the absorbent article (20), said barrier (44) having an inner

edge (44C'), an outer edge (44C''), and a pair of ends (44D), wherein said outer
edge (44C'') and ends (44D) of said barrier (44) is joined to said topsheet (38) and

at least a portion of said inner edges (44C') of said barrier (44) being
unattached to said topsheet (38) between said ends (44D);

characterized in that:
at least said topsheet (38) is extensible and said barrier (44) is less
extensible than said topsheet (38) so that upon extension of said

topsheet (38), said barrier (44) moves from a relatively flat disposition
to a more upright disposition to

form a lip that serves as a barrier to the flow of liquids.
said barrier (44 ) further overlaying said topsheet (38).
The absorbent article (20) of Claim 1 wherein said topsheet (38) is
extensible in the longitudinal direction.
The absorbent article (20) of Claim 1 having two barriers (44), one
adjacent each longitudinal side edge (22). 
The absorbent article (20) of Claim 1 wherein said backsheet (40) and
said absorbent core (42) are also extensible.
The absorbent article (20) of Claim 3 further comprising a barrier (44)
adjacent each of the end edges (24).
The absorbent article (20) of Claim 1 wherein said barrier (44)
comprises a liquid impervious film (144).
The absorbent article (20) of Claim 6 further comprising a soft
material (146) covering said liquid impervious film (144).
The absorbent article (20) of Claim 1 having a first end region (28), a
second end region (30) and a central region (32) disposed between said

first and second end regions (28), (30), wherein the central region (32) of
the absorbent article (20) is narrower than the end regions (28), (30).
The absorbent article (20) of Claim 8 having an hour glass shape.
The absorbent article (20) of Claim 8 having a dog bone shape.
The absorbent article (20) of Claims 1 or 8 having a main body
portion comprised of at least portions of said topsheet (38),

backsheet (40), and absorbent core (42), said main body portion having
said pair of longitudinal side edges (22) and said pair of end

edges (24) further comprising a pair of flaps extending outward
edges (24) further comprising a pair of flaps extending outward

from the longitudinal edges (22) of said main body portion of said
absorbent article (20).
