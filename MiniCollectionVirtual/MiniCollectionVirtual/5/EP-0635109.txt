<ABSTRACT>
A quick-connect fitting for transferring gaseous and/or liquid media, in particular for filling gas cylinders, has a housing (11) with an inlet (12), and outlet (13) for the medium to be transferred and a quick-connect device arranged in the area of the outlet (13) with clamping tongs (15, 15') that can be interlocked with an external complementary gripping profile, a hollow sealing piston (16, 16') that can glide in the housing (11) and an actuating device (17) for applying the clamping tongs (15, 15') which is linked to the sealing piston (16, 16') in a relatively movable manner by means of a sliding sleeve (18, 18'). At least one bolt (20) is provided for linking the sliding sleeve (18, 18') to the sealing piston (16, 16') and the actuating device has an elongated member (17) mounted on the housing (11) with a disk cam (36) that engages the sliding sleeve (18, 18') to make it move.

<CLAIMS>
Quick-connect fitting for transferring gaseous and/or 
liquid media, in particular for filling gas bottles, 

consisting of: 

a housing (11) with an inlet (12) and an outlet (13) for 
the medium to be transferred, and 
a quick-connect device arranged in the area of the outlet 
(13) with clamping tongs (15, 15') that can be interlocked 

with an external complementary gripping profile (40, 40'), 
a hollow sealing piston (16, 16') that can glide in the 
housing (11), and an actuating device (17) for applying the 

clamping tongs (15, 15'), which is linked to the sealing 
piston (16, 16') by means of a sliding sleeve (18, 18'), 
wherein the actuating device has a pivoting member (17) 
mounted on the housing (11) and having a disk cam (36), 
 
characterized in that
 
the disk cam (36) directly engages the sliding sleeve 

(18, 18') to make it move. 
Quick-connect fitting according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the sliding sleeve (18, 18') is linked to the 

sealing piston (16, 16') in a relatively movable manner. 
Quick-connect fitting according to claim 1 or 2,
 
characterized in that at least one bolt (20) is provided 

for linking the sliding sleeve (18, 18') to the sealing 
piston (16, 16'). 
Quick-connect fitting according to claim 3, characterized 
in that each bolt (20) at the sealing piston (16, 16') 

passes through a groove (23), which is aligned in the 
direction of the piston movement. 
Quick-connect fitting according to claim 3 or 4,
 
characterized in that the sliding sleeve (18, 18') 

surrounds the housing (11), whereby for the connection with 
the sealing piston (16, 16'), each bolt (20) passes through  

 
the housing (11) in a slotted hole (21) which is aligned in 

the direction of the piston movement. 
Quick-connect fitting according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the pivoting member (17) is constructed as a 

pivoting lever. 
Quick-connect fitting according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the pivoting member (17) has the shape of a lever 

which can be swivelled over the area of the outlet (13). 
Quick-connect fitting according to claim 7, characterized 
in that the pivoting lever (17) at the housing (11) is 

supported (B-B) in the area of the longitudinal axis of the 
housing (A-A) and that from an opened position, which is 

aligned approximately vertical to the longitudinal axis of 
the housing (A-A), the lever can be swivelled into a 

connected position beyond a plane in which lie the 
longitudinal axis of the housing (A-A) and the swivel axis 

(B-B). 
Quick-connect fitting according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the disk cam (36) engages the sliding sleeve 

(18, 18') in a recess (38) of the sliding sleeve (18, 18'). 
Quick-connect fitting according to claim 1 or 9, 
characterized in that the disk cam (36) has an eccentric 

swivel axis and an external profile with at least one cam 
top (37) for contact with the sliding sleeve (18, 18') 

prestressed in the direction of the outlet (13). 
Quick-connect fitting according to one of the previous 
claims, characterized in that for a connection to a nipple 

(40) with an external support profile (41), the 
prestressed, expandable clamping tongs (15) are supported 

at the housing (11) in a radial direction and in that they 
can be interlocked with the external profile (41) from the 

outside by means of a control surface (34) of the sliding 
sleeve (18).  

 
Quick-connect fitting according to one of the claims 1 
through 10, characterized in that for the connection to a 

nipple (40') with an internal support profile (41'), the 
prestressed, expandable clamping tongs (15') are supported 

at the housing (11) in a radial direction and in that they 
interlock with the internal support profile (41') by means 

of an external control surface profile (34') which is 
constructed at an extension (43) of the sealing piston 

(16'); the sliding sleeve (18') has a sealing sleeve (46) 
that can be telescoped and prestressed in the direction of 

the outlet (46).
