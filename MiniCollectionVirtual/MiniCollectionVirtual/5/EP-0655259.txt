<ABSTRACT>
A blood containment, visualization and tactile confirmation 
device (10) is provided for use with a vascular entry needle (40). The 

device (10) includes a visualization channel (34) 
and/or a complaint outer 

wall portion (14) which indicates whether a needle (40) connected to the 
device (10) has entered a selected blood vessel. The visualization 

channel (34) is vented to the outside to allow displaced air to escape, 
but has a gas permeable member (36) to prevent blood from escaping. The 

visualization channel (34) may have one, two, or more stages, with a 
first stage chamber (70a,104a) which indicates initial penetration of a 

selected blood vessel, and a second stage 
chamber (70b,104b) which fills more 

slowly and indicates that the needle (40) remains positioned within the 
blood vessel. A third stage chamber (104c) with entrapped air which 

compresses slightly due to the heartbeat may also be used. 
Preferably, a compliant outer wall portion pulses with changes in 

blood pressure, thereby providing a tactile indication that the 
needle tip is properly positioned. The device has a guideway (28) with 

a barrier (30) of elastomeric material which prevents blood from passing 
therethrough, but which allows passage of an elongated medical 

instrument such as catheterization apparatus.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to vascular entry 
devices and, more particularly, to a blood containment device for 
use with a vascular entry needle which provides visual and/or 
tactile confirmation that the needle tip has entered into a blood 
vessel, particularly an artery, and allows for introduction of an 
elongated medical instrument, such as catheterization guide wire, 
or comparable apparatus, through the device. It is a common medical procedure to insert a hollow needle 
into a patient's blood vessel for the purpose of either withdrawing 
blood or introducing a drug, guide wire, guide catheter, or the 
like into the blood vessel. One difficulty with such procedures, 
however, is determining when the tip of the needle is properly 
placed within the selected blood vessel. Another concern is that 
unless the blood is contained, vascular pressure, arterial pressure 
in particular, will force a leakage or spray of blood through the 
needle and escape through the other end of the needle. This can 
create a risk for the medical personnel of exposure to blood-borne 
viruses, such as hepatitis and HIV, which may be present in the 
patient's blood. The problems with blood containment and confirming needle 
placement are particularly applicable during the procedure for 
introducing a guide wire, catheter, or the like, into a patient's 
artery for carrying out procedures in or around the patient's 
heart. Such catheterization involves first creating access to the  
 
selected artery using a vascular entry needle of sufficient bore, 
and then inserting a guide wire, guide catheter, or other catheter 
apparatus through the needle and into the selected artery. Often, 
the guide wire is first inserted and located in the proper 
position, and the catheter is then inserted over the guide wire. 
Self-guiding catheters may also be inserted without first using a 
guide wire. After the catheter apparatus is in position, the 
vascular entry needle can be removed by sliding it backwards over 
and off the proximal end of the guide wire apparatus. In performing a catheterization procedure, as noted above, it 
is crucial that the vascular entry needle be properly positioned 
within the selected blood vessel. When an ordinary entry needle is 
used, entry of the needle tip into the blood vessel is indicated by 
the escape of blood at the proximal end of the needle. However, 
this has the attendant contamination problems mentioned above. Another problem is that, during positioning, the needle can be 
accidentally

<CLAIMS>
A blood containment and visualization device for use 
with a vascular entry needle, comprising: 

   a main body portion including a distal opening and a 
proximal opening and a guideway extending therebetween, said 

distal opening being adapted to communicatively connect to a 
vascular entry needle, and said proximal opening being adapted 

to receive an elongated medical instrument for passage through 
said guideway and said vascular entry needle; and 

   a visualization channel communicating with said distal 
opening and with the outside environment. 
The blood containment and visualization device of 
claim 1, further comprising a barrier disposed in said 

guideway between said proximal and distal openings which 
prevents passage of blood through said guideway but allows 

passage therethrough of the elongated medical instrument. 
The blood containment and visualization device of 
claim 1, wherein said main body portion comprises an outer 

longitudinally extending tubular member having an exterior and 
an interior surface and an inner tubular member having an 

exterior and an interior surface, said inner tubular member 
adapted to fit within said outer tubular member and to define 

said visualization channel therebetween. 
The blood containment and visualization device of 
claim 1, wherein said visualization channel includes two 

stages, a first stage which quickly fills with blood when a 
vascular entry needle connected to said distal opening enters 

a blood vessel, and a second stage which subsequently fills 
with blood at a slower rate than said flash chamber, 

indicating that the vascular entry needle remains positioned 
within the blood vessel. 
The blood containment and visualization device of 
claim 1, wherein said main body portion comprises a first 

member with the guideway formed therethrough and the 
visualization channel defined as a channel along the exterior 

surface of said first member, and a second member attached to 
said first member and forming a cover to confine blood within 

said channel. 
The blood containment and visualization device of 
claim 1, wherein said main body portion extends longitudinally 

in the direction of the guideway and has an exterior surface 
generally hourglass-like shaped to facilitate gripping. 
The device of claim 1, further comprising a gas 
permeabl
e member interposed between said visualization channel 
and the outside environment which allows passage of air but 

prevents the passage of blood. 
The device of claim 1, wherein said visualization 
channel includes a portion which is arranged in a spiral 

configuration about an axis generally perpendicular to the 
direction of the guideway. 
The blood containment and visualization device of 
claim 1, wherein said visualization channel further includes 

a chamber within which air is entrapped and compressed by 
blood pressure so as to allow visually detectable pulsations 

of blood due to changes in blood pressure from a heartbeat. 
The device of Claim 1, wherein said main body 
includes a touch accessible compliant member in fluid 

communication with said distal opening of the device such that 
blood pressure at said distal opening is transmitted to said 

compliant or flexible member, thereby causing said compliant 
member to move responsively to changes in blood pressure at 

said distal opening.
