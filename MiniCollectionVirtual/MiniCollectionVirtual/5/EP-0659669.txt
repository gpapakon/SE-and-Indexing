<ABSTRACT>
The subject matter of the invention is a device for introducing successively stacked envelopes into an open box (28) which has a stacking table (2) which is arranged downstream of a vertical stacker (1) and to which there is assigned a rod forming and moving device which has operating elements (9, 10) which are movable in the longitudinal direction table and transversely to it, and a filling station (29) which is arranged downstream of the stacking table (2). Known similar devices are not suitable for introducing densely packed stacked and filled envelopes into postboxes. The object of designing such a device in such a way that it is suitable for the quick and easy filling of postboxes is achieved in that the filling station (29) is arranged so as to form a longitudinal extension of the stacking table (2), is arranged downstream of a stop device (6, 45) which releases in the stack advance direction when under load, and has an inlet chute (30) into which there can be inserted a stamp (34) which is movable in a vertical direction approximately transversely to the stack advance direction and which is bounded on the side facing away from the stamp by a floor flap device (33) which opens when loaded in the stamp advance direction and is gripped from below by a box (28) reception table (35) which is arranged in a second plane.

run into a stack (4) reaching up to the region of the stop equipment (6, 
45), to make a gap (11) in it, and which my be run beyond the stop equip 

ment (6, 45), taking with it the column (8) of stack thus separated, the 
second working member being made as a support (10) for the rest of the 

stack, which may be run in the rear region of the separator and ejector 
slider (9) into the gap (11) formed by the latter and shifted at the 

speed of stack formation at most up to the stop equipment (6, 45). 
A device as in Claim 2,

characterized in that
 
   the stacker table (2) is flanked by lateral brushes (5) next the 

entry. 
A device as in one of the preceding Claims,

   the stacker table (2) is arranged with a slope up (a) in the  

 
direction of feed. 
A device as in one of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in that
 
   the stop equipment (6, 45) is made as a hinged stop equipment (6) and 

exhibits two flaps (6a) each able to swivel about a vertical axis at the 
side, preferably against the force of a return spring (6b), and the entry 

shaft (30) is bounded by a fixed stop (31) at the front in the direction 
of the stack feed. 
A device as in one of the Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that
 
   the stop equipment (6, 45) is made as a stack stop (45) able to 

travel linearly in the direction of the stack feed beyond the region of 
the plunger (34) up to an end position (47). 
A device as in one of the Claims 2 to 7, 
characterized in that
 
   the separator and ejector slider (9) is made in the shape of a wedge 

tapering in to its tip (15) and at this tip (15) is provided with a 
roller (16) which may be driven in rotation about an axis parallel with 

the plane of the stacker-table (2) and perpendicular to the direction of 
the stack feed. 
A device as in Claim 8,
