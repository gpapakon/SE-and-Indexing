<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an absorbent paper and an
absorbent article provided with the same. More particularly,
it relates to an absorbent paper which is excellent in liquid
absorption/permeation characteristics and liquid diffusion
characteristics and a thin absorbent article wherein the
absorbent paper is employed as an absorbent.There have been proposed a number of techniques
aiming at elevating the capacity of absorbing bodily fluid of
paper diapers, sanitary napkins and incontinence pads and
thus these products have been improved thereby. Most of
these improvements include increase in absorption rate,
prevention of the back-flow of the bodily fluid from the
surface of an absorbent, prevention of leakage and relief of
stickiness to the skin.Regarding a material for an absorbent article, for
example, it has been proposed to elevate the absorption
capacity and to prevent the post-absorption back-flow by
using a high-absorbent polymer, whereby a liquid is absorbed
and retained by taking advantage of a physicochemical action,
i.e., ion osmotic pressure, as a substitute for hydrophilic
absorbent papers or pulps whereby a liquid is absorbed
through a physical microspace. In fact, this proposal 
contributes to the improvement in the absorption capacity.
Thus absorbents comprising a combination of a pulp and a
high-absorbent polymer are employed in almost all absorbent
articles at present.However, these absorbent articles are still
insufficient in the prevention of leakage. It is suggested
by the fact that the major dissatisfaction at absorbent
articles resides in leakage. Also, it is pointed out that
the conventional absorbent articles have only limited rate of
absorbing bodily fluids and that it is therefore unavoidable
to use a high-absorbent polymer together with, for example,
pulp having a high absorption rate, which also proves the
above-mentioned disadvantage.As one of the reasons for the unsatisfactory effect
of preventing leakage of the conventional absorbent articles,
it may be mentioned that when pulp forms a flexible fluff
absorbent layer as an absorbent, it absorbs blood on the spot
and thus exhibits only a poor liquid diffusion
characteristics for utilizing the whole absorbent
efficiently. Although the fluff pulp shows a recovery from
compression and bending at a certain level in a dry state, it
suffers from a serious decrease in strength in a wet state
and thus scarcely shows any recovery. When a stress is
applied to wet pulp, therefore, the pulp undergoes
compressive deformation
