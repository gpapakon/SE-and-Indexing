<DESCRIPTION>
Contraceptive methods involving the 
administration of chemical substances are widely practiced 
among women who desire to limit pregnancies. Such methods 
control fertility through various biological mechanisms. 
Among the presently used chemical methods of fertility 
control, the most important are those which act by means of 
the following: (a) suppression of ovulation through 
inhibition of gonadotropin release; (b) alteration of the 
female reproductive tract to prevent migration of sperm to 
the site of fertilization or, if fertilization occurs, to 
block implantation of the zygote (nidation); (c) 
spermicidal action or (d) an abortifacient. The oral contraceptives are the most prominent 
chemical contraceptive agents. Two types of agents are (a) 
estrogen combined with a progestin, and (b) a progestin 
alone. The contraceptives of the combined type act 
primarily by suppressing ovulation by negative feedback to 
prevent gonadotropin (LH and FSH) release by the 
hypothalamus, but alterations in the reproductive tract may 
also contribute to the antifertility effect. Such 
alterations include changes in the cervical mucus (which 
increase the difficulty of sperm migration) and in the 
endometrium (which decrease the likelihood of nidation). 
The action of a progestin alone in a very low oral dose 
("mini-pill") appears to involve primarily alterations in 
the female reproductive tract, but ovulation suppression 
may also occur. Although the oral contraceptives are 
highly effective, their use is associated with unpleasant 
side effects (such as nausea, depression, weight-gain, and 
headache) and an increased long-time risk of severe disease 
(such as thromboembolism, stroke, myocardial infarction, 
hepatic adenoma, gall bladder disease, and hypertension). 
Bleeding irregularities (such as break-through bleeding, 
spotting, and amenorrhea) are also frequent. A progestin,  
 
when administered alone, causes an increased incidence of 
changes in menstrual patterns, especially a marked increase 
in the amount and duration of menstrual bleeding. Other chemical methods of contraception include 
the post coital administration of estrogens (e.g. 
diethylstilbestrol, antiprogestins, or ethynylestradiol) to 
prevent nidation or of prostaglandins which act as 
abortifacients. Both of these methods, at present, are 
limited to emergency situations. Still in the very early 
stages of development are immunological methods 
(vaccination) and methods involving the direct control of 
LHRH secretion from the
