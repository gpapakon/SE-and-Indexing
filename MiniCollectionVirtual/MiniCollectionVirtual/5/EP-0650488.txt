<ABSTRACT>
The 3-carboxaldehyde quinolines and naphthyridines have antibacterial activity of formula (1), wherein A, Y, R1 and R2 are as defined herein. These compounds are particularly suitable for administration by injection. A specific example of such compound is 1-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-7-((1S, 4S)-5-methyl-2,5-diazabicyclo(2.2.1)hept-2-yl)-4-oxo-1,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxaldehyde.

<DESCRIPTION>
 QUINOLINE AND NAPHTHYRIDINE PRODRUGSThis invention relates to quinoline and naphthyridine prodrugs having a 3- carboxaldehyde group, to antibacterial compositions containing said prodrugs and to a method of treating bacterial infections by administering said prodrugs.Antibacterial compounds derived from quinolines and naphthyridines are described in the prior art. U.S. Patent No. 4,861,779, which is incorporated herein by reference, discloses such compounds having a 3-carboxylic acid group.European patent publication 364 943 refers to antibacterial quinoline prodrugs which have a carboxaldehyde group at the three position. Kondo et al., J. of Medicinal Chem., 31 ,221 (1988) refers to oral administration of 3-carboxaldehyde quinolines which are rapidly metabolized into the corresponding 3-carboxyl quinolines and result in higher serum levels than those of the corresponding 3-carboxy quinoline. Chu et a}., Drugs Exptl. Clin. Res., XVI(9), 435 (1990) refers to the 3-carboxaldehyde prodrug of tosufloxacin having improved water solubility when compared to tosufloxacin itself allowing for the development of intravenous formulations of the prodrug. These publications do not refer to tissue damage encountered with intramuscular injection of 3-carboxy quinolines.In accordance with the invention, compounds are provided having the formula
 wherein A is CH, CF, or N; Y is ethyl, cyclopropyl, 4-flurophenyl, or 2,4-difluorophenyl; or A and Y when taken together are O-CH2-CH-C, CH2-CH2-CH-C or O-CH-N-C;I I ICH3 CH3 CH3R, is hydrogen or methyl, and R2 is hydrogen, 5-methyl-2,5-diazabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-yl, 8-methyl-3,8-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-3-yl, 1,4-diazabicyclo[3.2.2]non-4-yl, with the proviso that when R2 is hydrogen, then A and Y are taken together to form CH2CH2CH-C;ICH3
and the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof when R2 is other than hydrogen.Specific compounds of the invention are the 3-carboxaldehyde derivatives of danofloxacin, binfloxacin, and flumequine.The invention includes antibacterial compositions comprising a compound of the formula I as defined above in an amount sufficient for the treatment of bacterial infections, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.The invention further includes a method of treating a host affected by a bacterial infection by administering to said host an antibacterially effective amount of a compound of the formula I as defined above. The invention is particularly of use for treatment by injection. It has been found according to the invention that the
