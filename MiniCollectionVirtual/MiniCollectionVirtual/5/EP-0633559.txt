<ABSTRACT>
Speech recognition of stress-afflicted speech with a high recognition rate. Use of a neural network (NN), utilising the non-linear imaging properties. In a training phase, systematic parameter changes of stress-afflicted speech are used to train a neural network. In a speech recognition phase, by means of the parameter change trained, an imaging of stress-afflicted speech patterns onto stress-free patterns is carried out.

Process for speech recognition of speech with
variations of pronunciation due to stress or with

variations of pronunciation due to stress in a noisy
environment, in which, during a training phase, a neural

network (NN) trains systematic parameter changes of
pronunciation variations due to stress - the Lombard effect

- and pronunciation variations due to stress and noise,
from representative data material, and in a speech

recognition phase, by means of the trained parameter
changes and using non-linear imaging characteristics,

reproduces speech patterns modified by stress in stress-free
speech patterns, or reproduces speech patterns

modified by stress in a noisy environment in noise-reduced,
stress-free speech patterns.
Process according to Claim 1, in which, during the
training phase of the neural network, by means of non-linear

dynamic time warping (DTW), a section-by-section
search is made for corresponding stress-free speech

patterns and those affected by stress, or for corresponding
noise-less, stress-free and noisy speech patterns affected

by stress.
Process according to one of Claims 1 or 2, in which
the neural network (NN) is trained to variations in

pronunciation related to accent and dialect.
Device for speech recognition of speech with
variations of pronunciation due to stress or with

variations of pronunciation due to stress in a noisy
environment, comprising


a device for inputting speech (E

),
first means (A) for carrying out training for a neural
network (NN), 
the neural network (NN),
second means (B) for implementing speech recognition
having facilities for access to the neural network

(NN), and
third means (C), which reproduce speech patterns
affected by stress or speech patterns affected by

stress in a noisy environment in stress-free speech
patterns or stress-free, noise-reduced speech

patterns, using the non-linear imaging characteristics
of the neural network (NN).
Device according to Claim 4, in which a second neural
network for reducing additive background noise is added.
Device according to Claim 4, in which additional means
for reducing additive background noise are added.
