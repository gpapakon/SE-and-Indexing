<ABSTRACT>
A plurality of JFETs (junction field-effect transistors) can 
be formed on the same substrate while being electrically separated 

from each other, and can be also combined with a CMOS (complementary 

metal-oxide semiconductor). A P⁻type Si layer 14 is 
fabricated on a semiconductor substrate 11 as an island. On 

this island of P⁻type Si layer, an N⁺ source region 19 
and N⁺ drain region, and a channel region having a length of "Lg" 

and a channel depth of "Tg" are fabricated. The shape of the 
gate region with the gate length of "Lg" is not a V-shaped structure. 

Another P type layer 21 of the gate region is fabricated 
on the same plane as the source region 19 and the drain region 

15.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a junction field-effect 
transistor and a semiconductor integrated circuit device containing 
such a junction field-effect transistor. In Fig. 16, there is schematically shown a sectional view of 
a basic idea of an N-channel type junction field-effect transistor 
(simply abbreviated as an "N-channel JFET") known in the art. 
As illustrated in Fig. 16 A , an N⁻type semiconductor substrate 
(N⁻type layer) 100 has an N⁺type impurity layer 101 located 
opposite to the semiconductor substrate 100, one of which is a 
drain region and the other of which is a source region. This 
semiconductor substrate 100 further has an opposite conductivity 
type impurity region, i.e., P⁺type layer 103 functioning as a 
gate region. As shown in this drawing, the semiconductor device 
is so constructed that the channel current flowing through the 
drain-to-source path is controlled by varying the voltage applied 
between the gate electrode 104 and the source electrode 102 
to change the depletion layer 108. In general, the semiconductor 
device represents the pentode tube characteristic with the 
saturation region in case that the gate length "Lg" becomes 
longer than, or equal to approximately 2 micrometers, and the 
triode tube characteristic in case that the gate length becomes  
 
shorter than the approximately 2 micrometers. In any way, for 
instance, the drain current "Id"-to-gate voltage "Vg" characteristic 
indicates the normally ON type(state) semiconductor characteristic 
(also referred to a "depletion mode"), while the drain 
voltage "Vd" is constant, as shown in Fig. 16 B . Fig. 16 C 
represents a symbolic diagram of a general JFET. Fig. 17 schematically 
shows a sectional view of one example of the practical 
JFET having the V-shaped groove. In this practical JFET, an N⁻ 
type layer 100 is fabricated by way of the epitaxial growth, the 
thickness of which is on the order of 1 micrometer. The V-shaped 
groove 109 is formed by way of the anisotropic etching by 
KOH and the like, and both the gate length Lg and the gate thickness 
Tg are controlled within the required dimension of 1 micrometer. Fig. 18 schematically shows a sectional view for explaining 
the reason why a multiple element cannot be readily manufactured 
on the same semiconductor substrate in the conventional JFET. 
In the previously explained V-shaped groove type JFET, a V-shaped 
groove 1807 deeper than the V-shaped groove used to form the gate 
region is formed in such a manner that this groove 1807 reaches a 
gate
