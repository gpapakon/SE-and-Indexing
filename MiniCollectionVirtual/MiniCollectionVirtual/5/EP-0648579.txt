<ABSTRACT>
A resinous belt (1) is provided for holding a train of 
screws (8) each having a shank (8a) and a head (8b). The belt 

(1) comprises a series of screw retaining bores (3) formed in 
the belt (1) at a predetermined pitch longitudinally of the 

belt (1). Each screw retaining bore (3) has a diametrically 
smaller shank retaining portion (3a) for engagement with the 

screw shank (8a), and a diametrically larger root portion (3b) 
which has a first edge (3c) adjoining the shank retaining 

portion (3a) and a second edge (3d) remote from the shank 
retaining portion (3a). The screw retaining bore (3) is 

surrounded by a plurality of removal facilitating holes (5) 
formed in the belt (1). The root portion (3b) of the screw 

retaining bore (3) is located radially outside an imaginary 
cone (C) which contains the first and second edges (3c, 3d) of 

the root portion (3b).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a resinous belt for holding a 
train of screws. More specifically, the present invention 
relates to a screw train holding belt which is used in an 
automatic screw driver for successively feeding screws. As often experienced by many people, manual screw driving 
is a laborious and time-taking job. In particular, the screw 
driving job can be a serious trouble when it must be done 
extensively for a long time. For this reason, it has become a 
common practice to use an automatic screw driver when the screw 
driving job must be done extensively. For the convenience of description, a typical example of 
automatic screw driver is illustrated in Figs. 21 through 23 of 
the accompanying drawings. A similar screw driver is also 
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,059,034 to Hornung. As shown in Figs. 21-23, the prior art automatic screw 
driver mainly comprises a screw driver main 11 and a screw 
feeding attachment 12 removably connected to the driver main 
11. The driver main 11 carries a driver bit 13 which is rotated 
by a built-in motor (not shown). The screw feeding attachment 12 has an elongate case 14 and 
a slider 15 slidably fitted in the case 14. The slider 15 is 
always urged forward by a coil spring 16 and carries a pair of 
indexing sprockets 17 (only one shown) for indexing a screw 
train holding belt 18 which is made of a soft synthetic resin. 
The screw train holding belt 18 carries a train or series of  
 
screws 19 and has pairs of notches 18a for engagement with the 
pair of indexing sprockets 17 of the screw feeding attachment 
12, as shown in Fig. 24. In use, the slider 15 is held in abutment with a suitable 
portion of an object B (see Fig. 22), and the driver main 11 is 
pressed forward. As a result, the case 14 together with the 
driver bit 13 in rotation advances to drive a screw 19 (in front 
of the driver bit 13) of the screw train holding belt 18 into 
the object B while allowing the slider 15 to retreat into the 
case 14 against the coil spring 16. Upon finishing a screw driving operation, the driver main 
11 is brough away from the object B, thereby allowing the 
slider 15 to return to its initial position by the storing 
force of the coil spring 16. Such a returning movement of the 
slider 14 causes the sprockets 17 to index the screw train 
holding belt 18 for bringing another screw 19 to a position in 
front of the driver bit 13. As shown in Figs. 24 and 25 (and as disclosed in Japanese 
Utility Model Publication No. 4(1992)-49367 for example), the 
screw

<CLAIMS>
A resinous belt for holding a train of screws (8) each having 
a shank (8a) and a head (8b), the belt (1) comprising: a series 

of screw retaining bores (3) formed in the belt (1) at a 
predetermined pitch longitudinally of the belt (1), each of the 

screw retaining bores (3) being defined by a tube (2), said each 
screw retaining bore (3) having a diametrically smaller shank 

retaining portion (3a) for engagement with the shank (8a) of 
the screw (8), said each screw retaining bore (3) having a 

diametrically larger root portion (3b) which has a first edge 
(3c) adjoining the shank retaining portion (3a) and a second 

edge (3d) remote from the shank retaining portion (3a); and a 
plurality of removal facilitating holes (5) formed in the belt 

(1) around said each screw retaining bore (3) in communication 
therewith;
 
   characterized in that the root portion (3b) of said each 

screw retaining bore (3) is located radially outside an 
imaginary cone (C) which contains the first and second edges 

(3c, 3d) of the root portion (3b). 
The belt according to claim 1, wherein the root portion (3b) 
of said each screw retaining bore (3) is diametrically constant 

from the second edge (3d) to a position between the first and 
second edges (3c, 3d).  

 
The belt according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the root portion 
(3b) of said each screw retaining bore (3) is diametrically 

constant from the second edge (3d) to a position short of the 
first edge (3c) but beyond a surface of the belt (1) from which 

the tube (2) projects. 
The belt according to claim 1, wherein the root portion (3b) 
of said each screw retaining bore (3) is convexly curved outward 

in cross section vertical to the belt (1). 
The belt according to any one of claims 1 to 4, further 
comprising a depressed shoulder (6) formed around said each 

screw retaining bore (3) in a surface of the belt (1) which is 
opposite to the tube (2).
