<ABSTRACT>
A device for sampling a liquid in a tank or chemical reaction vessel, comprising a tube (1) fitted to a tank (2) containing a liquid (3). A cup (4) comprises a cavity (7), filling openings (6, 6') and an outflow channel (5). In its lowered position, the cup (4) is immersed in the liquid so that said liquid flows into the cavity (7) through the filling openings (6, 6'). Said cup (4) is connected to a drive device via a rod (8). A piston (9) causes the cup (4) to move upwards into a raised position until the outflow channel (5) is located above a collector (12) so that the liquid in the cup flows out into a channel defined by the collector, through an inlet (18) and towards a sampling valve (13).

Device for taking samples from a liquid in a tank or chemical reaction vessel
and comprising a cup (4) which is moved by a transfer mechanism in a tube (1),

the cup being movable to two positions, one being a position in which it is
immersed in a liquid (3) contained in a chemical reaction vessel (2), and another

being a position in which the cup is at the level of a collector (12), and
characterized by the fact that the cup (4) contains a cavity (7), filling openings

(6,6') and an outlet pipe (5), and by the fact that the cup (4), the filling openings
and outlet pipe of which cannot be sealed, is intended in one position to be

immersed in the liquid (3) in such a way that the liquid (3) can enter the cavity
(7) through the filling openings (6,6') and is intended in another position to be

located above the collector (12) in such a way that the liquid contained in the
cavity (7) can flow through the outlet pipe (5) into an opening (18) and flow off

into an inlet valve (16) and into a sampling valve (13).
Sampling device according to claim 1 and characterized by the fact that the
outlet pipe (5) is arranged at an angle in the lower part of the cup (4) in such a

way that the liquid contained in the cup can flow away completely as a
continuous trickle.
Sampling device according to claim 1 and characterized by the fact the upper
part of the collector (12) has a conical shape in such a way as to be a recovery

channel for the liquid.
Sampling device according to claim 1 and characterized by the fact that the
tube (1) contains an opening (18) for the admission of the liquid and a drainage

opening (19) for the return of the liquid and by the fact that an inlet valve (16), a
sampling valve (13) and a drainage valve (17) are located between the two

openings (18 and 19).
Sampling device according to claim 1 and characterized by the fact that the
cup (4) is connected by a rod (8) to a transfer mechanism consisting of a piston

(9) and a cylinder (10).
Sampling device according to claim 1 and characterized by the fact that the
lower part of the tube (1) is extended in the form of a protective sheath.
