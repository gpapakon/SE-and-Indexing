<ABSTRACT>
A method of treating with a photocatalyst the air in a bacteria-contaminated patient's room and a malodorous substance-floating 
room. A film of an optical catalyst consisting of a semiconductor, such as titanium dioxide is set on the inner surface of a 

wall of a patient's room or a dwelling room. The photocatalyst film is irradiated with the light from a general illuminating light 
source, such as a fluorescent lamp, and optically excited with a small quantity of ultraviolet rays contained in the light from the 

fluorescent lamp. The wattage of the fluorescent lamp and the distance between the photocatalyst film and fluorescent lamp are 
selectively determined so that the intensity of the ultraviolet rays the energy of which is not less than the band gap energy of the 

photocatalyst becomes 0.001-1 mW/cm², preferably 0.01-0.1 mW/cm². The bacteria and chemical compounds deposited on 
the optically excited film are photodecomposed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a photocatalytic process
for the treatment of an indoor environment contaminated by
bacteria and airborne substances.Living spaces of residences and offices may carry airborne
malodorous substances including sulfur compounds such as hydrogen
sulfide and methyl mercaptan, nitrogen compounds such as ammonia,
and other compounds such as fatty acid. To provide a comfort of
living environment, it is desirable to treat the contaminated air
for removal of the malodorous substances. In medical
environment, on the other place, antibiotic medication has
induced inadvertent evolution of those bacteria having resistance
against antibiotics. Among them, methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), for example, has caused serious
problem of nosocomial (i.e., in-hospital) infection.Accordingly, attention has been drawn toward the use of
semiconductive photocatalyst for the purposes of processing the
environment contaminated by bacteria and malodorous substances.Since one of the inventors of the present invention and his
coworker have reported their investigation on photoelectrolytic
process of water (known as the "Honda and Fujishima effect") in a
photoelectrochemical cell having a single-crystal semiconductor
electrode of titanium dioxide (TiO2) in the form of rutile and a
counter electrode of platinum (Nature, vol. 238(1972), 37-38),
many researches have been carried out on the treatment of various
media with semiconductive photocatalyst.To briefly set out the principle of the photocatalytic
process in a photoelectrochemical cell with reference to FIG. 1
of the accompanying drawings, when a semiconductor photocatalyst
is illuminated and is caused to absorb the light energy (hν) 
higher than the band gap energy (Eg) of the semiconductor, the
electrons in the valance band is photoexcited onto the conduction
band to produce electron-hole pairs (e--h+) at the surface layer
of the semiconductor.
hν → e- + h+In order for the thus generated electrons and holes to
contribute in the photoelectrolysis of water, they must be moved,
respectively, to separate oxidation and reduction sites that are
spaced from each other (charge separation). Otherwise, the
electrons and holes would encounter recombination to result
conversion into thermal energy without contributing in the redox
process.In a photoelectrochemical cell wherein a semiconductor-electrolyte
junction is present, charge separation is carried out
in the following manner. Thus, as the semiconductor is brought
into contact with the
