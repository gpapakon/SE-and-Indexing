<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an electric pump (40, 44) for delivering water, comprising a pump chamber (9) having a diaphragm (6), and a piezoelectric oscillating member (7) which is attached to the diaphragm (6). The pump chamber (9) is connected to a reservoir (25, 34, 42), which can be filled with water, via an inlet (4, 17) at which a check (non-return) valve (4, 18) is constructed which closes in the direction of the reservoir (25, 34, 42), and is connected to a consumer via an outlet (10, 21). When overpressure prevails in the pump chamber (9), the check valve (4, 18) on the one hand blocks the connection from the reservoir (25, 34, 42) to the pump chamber (9), with the result that liquid is fed via the outlet (10, 21) to an exit opening (37, 46). On the other hand, the check valve (4, 18) opens in the case of underpressure in the pump chamber (9), with the result that liquid can flow via the reservoir (25, 34, 42) into the pump chamber (9) (suction phase). An ascending pipe (11, 38, 45) leads from the outlet (10) of the pump chamber (9) to the exit opening (37, 46), which is situated above the level of the maximum filling of the reservoir (25, 34, 42). During the suction phase, the abrupt rapid movements of the diaphragm (6) produce in the region of the check valve (4, 18) independently of the filling in the reservoir (25, 34, 42) an underpressure with respect to the water pressure prevailing at the inlet (4, 17), with the result that water flows into the pump chamber (9) from the reservoir (25, 34, 42).

An electrically powered pump (40, 44) for the 
delivery of water in domestic appliances, including a 

pump chamber (9) having a diaphragm (6) and a piezoelectric 
oscillatory member (7) attached to the diaphragm 

(6), in which the pump chamber (9) is connected to a 
reservoir (25, 34, 42) adapted to be filled with water 

through an inlet (4, 17) on which a check valve (4, 18) 
impeding flow in the direction of the reservoir (25, 34, 

42) is provided, and further to a load through an outlet 
(10, 21), in which the reservoir (25, 34, 42) is arranged 

at a higher level than the pump chamber (9), and in which 
the check valve (4, 18) closes the connection from the 

reservoir (25, 34, 42) to the pump chamber (9) in the 
presence of a pressure above atmospheric in the pump 

chamber (9), so that fluid is supplied through the outlet 
(10, 21) to a discharge orifice (37, 46) (delivery 

cycle), while on the other hand the check valve (4, 18) 
is opened in the presence of a pressure below atmospheric, 

enabling fluid to flow through the reservoir 
(25, 34, 42) into the pump chamber (9) (suction cycle),
characterized in that
 a riser 
(11, 38, 45) extends from the outlet (10) of the pump 

chamber (9) to the discharge orifice (37, 46), that said 
discharge orifice is arranged above the maximum fill 

level of the reservoir (25, 34, 42), and that movement of 
the diaphragm (6) during the suction cycle produces in 

the area of the check valve (4, 18) independently of the 
fill level in the reservoir (25, 34, 42) a pressure below 

atmospheric relative to the water pressure prevailing on 
the inlet (4, 17) so rapidly that water flows from the 

reservoir (25, 34, 42) into the pump chamber (9). 
The pump as claimed in claim 1,
characterized in that
 a vented 
overflow (28) from which a downspout (30, 39) branches 

off adjoins the discharge orifice (37, 46). 
The pump as claimed in claim 2,
characterized in that
 a valve 
(57) adapted to control the passage of water is provided 

in the conduit (11, 30; 33, 38, 36; 45) between the outlet 
(10, 21) and the load. 
The pump as claimed in claim 3,
characterized in that
 the valve 
(57) is provided in the overflow (28) to the downspout 

(30, 39).  
 
The pump as claimed in claim 2,
characterized in that
 an opening 
(58) adapted to control the fill level in the overflow 

(28) is provided in the overflow (28), said opening being 
in fluid communication with the reservoir (25). 
The pump as claimed in claim 1,

is covered with an insulating film (48) formed of a nonconductive 
material. 
The pump as claimed in claim 1,

valve (5) is comprised of a thin-walled disk (12) formed

that said disk (12) is provided with an incision (13) 
shaped in the manner of the arc of a circle, and that the 

area enclosed by the incision (13) defines a valve flap

The pump as claimed in claim 1,
