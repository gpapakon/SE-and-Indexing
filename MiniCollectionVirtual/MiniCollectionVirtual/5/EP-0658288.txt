<ABSTRACT>
A connection system for so-called "cordless" electrical appliances is designed to permit a substantial degree of freedom in the placement of the appliance proper onto the base from which it takes its electrical supply. In a first embodiment (Fig. 1), a plug and socket connector is employed, the plug being coupled to the appliance proper and the socket to the base, and the socket incorporates a pair of pivoting shutter elements which are arranged to be pivoted apart as the plug is inserted into the socket, the plug at the same time unlocking a shutter locking arrangement; this arrangement permits insertion of the plug into the socket throughout almost a full 360  of relative rotation of the plug relative to the socket. A second embodiment (Fig. 7) employs but a single shutter element in the socket part and the shutter is arranged to jam and prevent access to the socket if it is not uniformly depressed; this arrangement permits a full 360  of rotation of the plug relative to the socket.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally concerns improvements relating to electrical appliances
and connectors therefor and more particularly relates to an improved connection system
for so-called "cordless" electrical water heating appliances such as electric kettles and hot
water jugs in which power is supplied to a liquid heating vessel via a base unit coupled to
the electrical supply, there being co-operating electrical connectors on the base unit and
the vessel for powering a heating element of the vessel via the base.Cordless appliances generally have a socket outlet provided in or on the base unit
and a mating connecting inlet in or on the appliance proper, and generally require fairly
precise alignment between these two parts in order to connect the appliance proper to the
base. The connecting inlet of the appliance proper commonly comprises a set of male
terminal pins which are adapted to mate with a complementary set of female terminals
provided in a shrouded portion of the base unit, and the base unit terminals are commonly
provided in an upstand formed on the base unit and adapted to locate in a generally
complementary recess formed in the body of the appliance proper for providing the
degree of alignment between the respective parts that is necessary to ensure correct
mating of the two parts of the connection system. An exemplary cordless connection
system of this kind is disclosed in our British Patent Application No. 9102099.0 (GB-A-2
241 390). An alternative system in which the terminal pins are provided in the base unit
and complementary spring terminals are provided in the appliance proper is disclosed in
our British Patent Application No. 9018502.6 (GB-A-2 236 220).The requirement that the appliance proper and the base unit should mate with
each other only in a predetermined single orientation is a restriction upon the freedom of
the appliance designer to achieve the desired product form and also presents some
inconvenience to users of the appliance. It has previously been recognized that an
excessive requirement for alignment of the appliance proper with the base unit is 
undesirable and in British Patent No. GB-B-2 221 104 (Strix Ltd.) there is
disclosed a cordless connection system which is generally conventional but is
adapted to accommodate a degree of initial misalignment of the appliance
proper with the base.It has also been known since 1968 (US 3,398,260 A) to provide a
cordless electric smoothing iron in which the iron and its stand have current-conducting
members which permit the iron to
