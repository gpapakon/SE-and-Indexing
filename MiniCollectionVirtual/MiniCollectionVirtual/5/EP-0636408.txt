<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with high density, high surface area
adsorbents.Fluidized bed adsorption has been recognized in the pharmaceutical industry
as an attractive alternative to whole broth solvent extraction for isolating
extracellular products from fermentation broths. Whole broth solvent extraction
includes direct extraction with an immiscible solvent, followed by subsequent phase
separation using centrifugal separators. There are several disadvantages associated
with whole broth solvent extraction, i.e. the method requires costly centrifugal
equipment and uses large volumes of solvent with associated requirements for
large volume tanks and solvent recovery processing.In a fluidized bed adsorption process a product or by-product is extracted
directly from the fermentation broth onto an adsorbent in an upflow fluidized bed
and can be subsequently eluted from the adsorbent particles. Fluidized bed
adsorption avoids the problems of high equipment costs and high solvent use that
are associated with the full broth extraction methods.An adsorbent for use in fluidized bed adsorption of products from
fermentation broths must have a higher terminal settling velocity than the broth
solids, wherein terminal settling velocity means the upflow velocity at which
particles will not remain in the column, so that the adsorbent particles remain in the
column. The adsorbent particles must also exhibit a sufficiently high specific
adsorptive capacity, i.e. grams of products adsorbed per gram adsorbent, for the
product to be separated under the dynamic conditions in the fluidized bed to allow
cost effective processing. Furthermore, since the products of the fermentation are to
be used in pharmaceutical applications, it is highly desirable that the particles do not
release any impurities during processing that might contaminate the product.A brominated vinylaromatic adsorbent made by bromination of, e.g., a
styrene-divinylbenzene copolymer, is disclosed in Japanese Patent No. 59089311.
The adsorbent provides a specific surface area of at least 200 square meters per gram
and has a bromine content of 3 to 20 weight percent. A brominated styrenedivinylbenzene
copolymer has been used to separate immunomycin from a
fermentation broth, see Gaillot, F.T., Gleason, C., Wilson, J. J. and Zwark, J.,
"Fluidized Bed Adsorption for Whole Broth Extraction", Biotechol. Prog.
6,370-375 (1990). FR-A-2,372,845 discloses a method of manufacturing high density ion and
