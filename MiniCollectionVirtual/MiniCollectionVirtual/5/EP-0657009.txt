<ABSTRACT>
An indicia-holding device (20) can be attached to a key (22) for permitting the indicia (300) to be associated with the key (22). The device (20) for holding the indicia (300) includes a frame (28) having a rim (208) which engages with the edge (202) of a plate (200) which covers or bears the indicia. In order to firmly attach the plate (200) to the frame (28), the frame (28) is stressed in such a manner that the rim (208) of the frame is moved inward, effectively reducing the circumference of the frame (28). Stress can be induced by way of a screw (68), for example, by using a screw (68) which is also used to clamp the indicia-holding device (20) to the key (22). A second hole (208) assists in removing the plate (200) from the frame (28) for example, for replacement of the indicia (300). The indicium-bearing device (20) can also include other key accessories such as a light (42).

 FRAME LOCK MECHANISM FOR A KEY LIGHTBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a portable device for attaching indicia to a key, and more specifically, to a portable device which may be attached to a key having a head of any width and which allows indicia to be changed easily.The attachment of indicia directly to keys has been provided in previous devices. Such indicia are attached to keys for purposes such as identification and decoration. However, previous devices had a number of disadvantages. In some devices, indicia could not be attached to keys securely. In many cases, indicia could not be changed easily. Typically, keys had to be specially formed to accommodate indicia, and indicia could not be removed from such keys without leaving a noticeable vacant area where the indicia had been attached. Indicia had to be specially formed to adapt to each particular shape and style of key, precluding the use of an indicia design for several key types and preventing interchangability of indicia among various key styles. There is a need for an inexpensive way to securely attach indicia to keys having heads of a variety of widths or other configurations, allowing indicia to be changed easily, allowing the use of a single style of indicia for many types of key, and allowing removal of such indicia without leaving a noticeable vacant area on the key.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a key holder for attaching indicia to a key. The holder can be used on keys with heads having a variety of widths. Preferably, the key holder also includes a light.The key head is clamped between a body portion and frame which are held together by a screw or similar securing device. The securing device extends through a hole in the body 

portion, a hole in the key head and engages with a threaded hole or similar device in the frame.The frame includes a rim portion defining a recessed region. A stress inducer is coupled to the frame. The stress inducer is preferably the securing device (e.g., the screw). Indicia are held in place, preferably beneath a transparent plate shaped to fit within the region defined by the rim. The plate and/or the indicia are secured in position by action of the stress inducer pulling the rim against the edges of the plate.In one embodiment of the present invention, a screwdriver is provided for tightening or loosening the securing device. Preferably, the screwdriver is carried in a recess provided in the body portion. The screwdriver, when provided, allows

<CLAIMS>
WHAT IS CLAIMED IS;
1. In a key holder, apparatus for use in displaying, comprising: a body portion of the key holder; a frame, coupled to said body portion, said frame including a web portion and a rim portion, coupled to said web portion; a plate, configured for engagement with said rim portion; and a stress-inducer coupled, to said frame wherein said rim portion is configured to move in response to stress induced by said stress-inducer so as to engage with said plate.
2. Apparatus, as claimed in claim 1, wherein said key holder includes a light source.
3. Apparatus, as claimed in claim 1, wherein said stress-inducer includes a screw extending between said body and said frame.
4. A key light comprising: a body portion, attachable to a key, said body portion including a light source and having at least a first hole therethrough; a frame including a surface having a threaded hole and a rim coupled to said surface, said rim defining a first space; a plate, having an edge, said plate configured to fit within said first space; a screw inserted through said first hole of said body portion and engaging said threaded hole of said surface so as to pull said surface toward said body portion and move said rim inwardly into said space to form an engagement with said edge of said plate.
5. A key light, as claimed in claim 4, wherein said engagement is a frictional engagement. 


 6. A key light, as claimed in claim 4, wherein said engagement includes configuration of said rim so as to define a perimeter equal to or smaller than the perimeter of said plate.
7. An ornament for a key comprising: a frame having a rim, said rim defining a first space; a plate, having an edge, positionable within said first space; means for moving said rim between a first configuration permitting removal of said plate from said first space, and a second configuration preventing removal of said plate from said first space; and means for attaching said frame to said key.
8. An ornament, as claimed in claim 7, wherein said means for attaching includes a base portion and wherein said means for moving includes a screw which attaches said base portion to said frame.
9. A key holder comprising: a body portion, attachable to a key, said body portion having at least a first hole therethrough; a frame including a surface having a threaded hole and having a rim coupled to said surface, said rim defining a first space; a plate, having an edge, said plate configured to fit within said first space; a screw inserted through said first hole of said body portion and engaging said threaded hole of said surface so as to attach said body portion to said frame; and opening means in said frame for receiving an instrument for pushing on said plate to remove said plate from said first space.
10. A key holder, as claimed in claim 9, wherein said opening means comprises said threaded hole. 


 11. A key holder, as claimed in claim 9, wherein said opening means comprises a hole in said frame different from said threaded hole.
12. A key holder, as claimed in claim 9, further comprising means for preventing scratching of said plate by said instrument.
13. A key holder, as claimed in claim 9, wherein said means for preventing scratching comprises a paper sheet.
