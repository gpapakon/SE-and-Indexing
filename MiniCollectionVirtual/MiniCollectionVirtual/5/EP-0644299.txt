<ABSTRACT>
A simplified vacuum sewer system comprises a limited 
number of toilet bowls (1), preferably at the most 60 toilet 

bowls, which through a sewer pipe (2) are connected to a 
common sewage collecting container (4), and means for 

generating and maintaining a considerable partial vacuum in 
the sewer pipe (2) and in the collecting container (4). The 

sewage collecting container is a relatively small reservoir 
(4) which has to be frequently emptied and the volume of which 

is preferably at the most 100 litres. A dry sliding-vane 
rotary vane pump (5) including a protective liquid separating 

means (6, 9) operates as a partial vacuum generating device 
which includes a rigidly installed tube and valve system (6a, 

8, 21, 22) by means of which the pressure side of the dry 
rotary vane pump (5) periodically can be connected to the 

collecting container (4) for emptying the container to another 
location by means of the pressure created by the sliding-vane 

pump (5).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a simplified vacuum sewer system
for toilets according to the preamble of claim 1 and to a
method of operating such a system according to the preamble
of claim 8, (see f.i. document US-A-4,521,925).Nowadays ships almost invariably use vacuum sewer
toilets. The bowls of such toilets are connected, through a
normally-closed sewer valve, to a sewer pipe that is kept
under a considerable partial vacuum. Modern marine vacuum
sewer systems are almost without exception devised according
to US-A-4034421. This kind of system is well suited for
systems including a large number of toilets, but is
unnecessarily expensive in ships where the number of toilets
is relatively small. For instance, freighters or cargo ships
usually have only between 5 and 40 toilets. An inexpensive,
easy to install and reliable toilet vacuum sewer system for
this kind of ship has not been commercially available
heretofore.This invention seeks to provide a simplified vacuum sewer
system with low manufacturing and installation costs that is
well suited for use in vacuum sewer systems in which the
number of toilet bowls is clearly less than 100 units and in
which it is unlikely that very many toilet bowls will be
flushed at the same time. The invention has particular, but
not exclusive, application to ships. What constitutes the
invention is defined in the following claims 1 and 8.It is known to use a liquid ring pump for generating a
partial vacuum in a sewer system, where moisture and dirt
abound. A liquid ring pump utilises an eccentrically rotating
ring of liquid which effects the volume increase and decrease
of a pumping space in the pump. Such a pump is reliable and
operates well, but its efficiency rate is low, which means
that its power demand is high. Additionally, a liquid ring 
pump needs an expensive automatic arrangement to ensure that
there is always enough liquid (frequently water) in the liquid
ring of the pump. The vacuum sewer system according to US-A-4034421,
does not use a liquid ring pump, instead a
circulation pump runs an ejector pump that produces the
required vacuum. This combination operates reliably but its
efficiency rate is only about 5%.The invention is based on the concept that, contrary to
the trend of the prior art, a dry rotary vane pump could be
used as a vacuum pump. Although this kind of pump is
relatively cheap and has good efficiency, dry vane pumps do
not, however, tolerate moisture. Thus to make it possible to
use a dry rotary vane pump in a vacuum sewer system according
to

<CLAIMS>
A vacuum sewer system comprising a plurality
of toilet bowls (1), preferably at the most 60 toilet

bowls, which through a sewer pipe (2) are connected to a
common sewage collecting container (4), and means for

generating and maintaining a considerable partial vacuum in
the sewer pipe (2) and in the collecting container (4),

the sewage collecting container
being an intermediate storage reservoir (4) which has to be periodically

emptied and the volume of which is preferably at the most 100
litres, characterised in that the partial vacuum generating means comprises a dry rotary vane pump (5) including a

protective liquid separating means (6, 9),
in that a

rigidly installed tube and valve system (6a, 8, 21, 22)
is connected to the pump so that the pressure side of the dry rotary vane pump

(5) periodically can be connected to the collecting container
(4) for emptying the container to another location by means

of the pressure created by the dry rotary vane pump (5), and 
in that

the sewer pipes (2) of the toilet bowls (1) are connected to
the collecting container (4) through a common end tube (3),

which communicates with the collecting container (4) via a
separating device (9), in which air accompanying the sewage

in the sewer pipe can be drawn off, thereby reducing the flow
speed of the sewage before the sewage arrives in the interior

of the collecting container (4) through the outlet opening
(9a) of the device (9).
A system according to claim 1, 
characterised in that

the collecting container (4) is cylindrical and the separating
device (9) of the sewer end tube is a curved tube (9)

contacting the circumferential surface (11) of the collecting
container (4), preferably at its outside, which tube (9), at

the side that is closer to its centre of curvature, has a

plurality of apertures (12) opening to the interior of the 
collecting container (4), through which apertures air

separated from the sewage can pass into the container.
A system according to claim 2, 
characterised in that

the longitudinal axis (13) of the cylindrical collecting
container is offset (A) from a vertical position and that the

tube (9) working as a separating device is mounted to follow
the circumferential surface of the collecting container with

a downward slope.
A system according to claim 3, 
characterised in that

in the collecting container (4) there is an outlet tube (8),
the inlet end (14) of which is in close vicinity to the lowest

part (15) of the obliquely mounted collecting container (4).
A system according to any of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that
 in the collecting container (4) there
is a level monitor (16) which is arranged to transmit a signal

activating an emptying sequence, when the collecting container
(4) contains sewage (17) to a pre-set depth below the outlet

opening (9a) of the device (9).
A system according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that
 in the end tube (3) of the sewer pipe
there is, close to the collecting container (4), a U-shaped

tube (19), which acts as a collecting trap for liquid
remaining in the sewer, sewage collected in the trap

subsequently being available to form a liquid plug.
A system according to any of the preceding claims, 

characterised in that
 the dry rotary vane pump (5) has a
single air duct (6a) connecting it to the collecting container

(4), through which duct (6a) the collecting container (4) is
put under partial vacuum during filling as well as under

pressure during emptying, and in that during the vacuum
generating phase, the air flow from the collecting container

(4) in the direction to the pump (5) is
through a moisture separating device (6), which preferably

also comprises a means protecting the system from overfilling
of the collecting container (4).
A method of operating up to 60 toilet bowls (1), in
a vacuum sewer system, which method involves evacuating sewage

material (17) from the bowls into a collecting container (4)
via sewer piping (2, 3, 9) by

creating sub-atmospheric pressure in the container and piping,
characterised in that a dry rotary

vane pump (5) connected via a moisture trap (6, 24) to said
collecting container (4) is used as vacuum pumping means, in that the dry rotary vane pump

(5) is also used for periodically generating supra-atmospheric
pressure in the container (4) for emptying the same, and in

that sewage flows from the sewer pipes (2) of the toilet
bowls (1) to the collecting container (4) through a

common end tube (3) which communicates with the collecting
container (4) via a separating device (9), in which air accompanying

the sewage is drawn off, thereby reducing the speed of
the sewage before the sewage arrives in the collecting

container (4) through the outlet opening (9a) of the device
(9).
A method according to claim 8, 
characterised in that

in the emptying phase of the collecting container (4), the
pressure created by the dry rotary vane pump (5) is arranged

to be led to the collecting container (4) in the form of a
relatively rapid air flow (via 18) that is directed against

a level monitor (16) for cleaning the monitor (16) from
matter sticking to it.
