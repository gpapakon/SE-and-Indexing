<ABSTRACT>
An electrical connector (2) for electrically 
connecting to conducting circuit traces on a card (4), 

includes contact wheels (20) rotatably mounted on 
resilient cantilever arms (22). The wheels (20) project 

into a card receiving slot (8) of the connector (2) such 
that when the card (4) is inserted therein, the wheel 

contacts (20) are resiliently biased out of the slot (8) 
to press against a surface of the card, whereby further 

insertion thereof causes the contact wheels to roll over 
the surface of the card thereby avoiding rubbing of the 

contact surfaces whilst nevertheless maintaining suitable 
contact pressure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an electrical connector
which can be mounted to a printed circuit board and which
can receive a memory card, and more particularly related
to a connector with reduced contact rubbing-wear.It is quite common for various security systems to
include memory cards, or so called "smart cards" for
interconnection to an associated connector. This memory
card has active devices mounted on the circuit card which
are interconnected to electrical traces on the printed
circuit card. The circuits generally carry an access code
on the circuit card. The cards are then inserted into the
system, which may be a car radio or telephone, or which
may be an access panel which will unlock the door to a
secured area within a building.JP 59-36387-A discloses an electrical connector for
electrical connection between electrical circuit traces
of a memory card and electrical circuit traces of a
printed circuit board. The electrical connector has a
slot profiled for receiving the memory card therein and
contact means for interconnection to the traces of the
printed circuit board, wherein the contact means are
electrically connected to contact roller means positioned
approximate to said slot whereby said contact roller
means can roll along said substrate card during insertion
thereof, into engagement with said traces on said memory
card. The contact roller means in this document are a
rotatable cylinder connector which is made of an elastic
member.Due to the frequent use of these memory cards, one
of the requirements is that the contacts and card circuit
traces can withstand a large number of contacting cycles.
To achieve this requirement, it is necessary to avoid or 
considerably reduce the rubbing action of the connector
contacts on the card circuit traces.With reference to the above mentioned requirements,
the object of this invention is to provide an electrical
connector for electrical connection with circuit traces
on a memory card whereby rubbing between the connector
contacts and the card circuit traces is avoided.Another object of this invention, is to provide the
above connector in such a way that it can be easily
manufactured and yet remain reliable.Yet another object of this invention is to provide a
card connector for reduced contact rubbing wear that is
compact and cost-effective.The invention provides an electrical connector as
defined in claim 1. Preferred embodiments are defined in
the dependent claims.The above mentioned objects have been achieved by
providing an electrical connector
