<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an aluminum alloy 
sheet for use in press forming and a method of manufacturing 
the same, more particularly, to an aluminum alloy 
sheet suitable for use in an automobile body, exhibiting 
excellent bake hardening property, even if baking is 
performed at a low temperature in the range of 120 to 
180°C for a short period of time of 5 to 40 minutes. The Patent Abstracts of Japan, Vol. 17, No. 236 (C-1057), 
May 13, 1993, relating to JP-A-04365834, discloses an 
aluminum alloy sheet for press forming. The composition 
comprises 1.5 to 3.8 percent by weight Mg, 0.25 to 3.0 
percent by weight Cu, 0.15 to 0.76 percent by weight Si, 
0.03 to 0.25 percent by weight Fe, 0.005 to 0.15 percent by 
weight Ti, 0.0002 to 0.05 percent by weight B and a balance 
of aluminum. The alloy sheet is prepared by subjecting an 
ingot of the aluminum alloy to homogenizing at 450°C to 
580°C, forming this ingot to a desired thickness by hot 
rolling and cold rolling and subjecting the resultant sheet 
to a heat treatment. The Patent Abstracts of Japan, Vol. 14, No. 134, (C-0701), 
March 14, 1990, relating to JP-A-02008353, discloses the 
manufacture of an aluminum alloy for use in press forming. 
The essential components of the alloy include 3.0 to 5.0 
percent by weight Mg, 0.06 to 0.6 percent by weight Zn and 
0.3 to 2.0 percent by weight Cu with a balance of aluminum. 
The composition further includes at least one of Mn, Cr, Ti 
and B. The Patent Abstracts of Japan, Vol. 17, No. 124 (C-1035), 
March 16, 1993, relating to JP-A-04304339, discloses an 
aluminum alloy sheet for use in press forming. The alloy 
composition includes 1.5 to 8.0 percent by weight Mg, 0.25 
to 3.0 percent by weight Cu, 0.02 to 0.15 percent by weight 
Si, 0.03 to 0.25 percent by weight Fe, 0.005 to 0.15 
percent by weight Ti, 0.0002 to 0.05 percent by weight B, 
0.10 percent by weight Zn and a balance of aluminum. The Mg 
and Cu are present in a prescribed ratio of their 
respective amounts and the formed crystal structure is such 
that the average aspect ratio of the crystalline grains is 
regulated to be less than 1.3. A conventional surface-treated cold-rolled steel 
sheet has frequently been used as a sheet material for 
automobile body panel. In recent years, however, for 
the purpose of reducing fuel consumption, a light-weight 
automobile body panel material has been demanded. To 
satisfy the demand, aluminum alloy sheets have begun 
to be used for the automobile body panel. Nowadays, manufacturers in press
