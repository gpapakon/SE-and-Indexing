<ABSTRACT>
A container (6) of plastics material in which a bottom 
(7) defining the floor of the container (6) itself has at 

least one pair of integral external projections (11), 
also formed of plastics material, which project from the 

bottom (7) to bear against a portion of the chassis (2) 
of an associated vehicle (1); the projections (11) 

having respective transverse holes (17) for engagement by 
the screws (16) of a system (13) adapted to enable the 

container (6) to be fixed to the chassis (2) of the 
vehicle (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a container of plastics 
material which can be attached to a commercial vehicle 
chassis. The present invention may be applied to advantage, but 
not exclusively, in the field of commercial vehicles 
adapted for the transport of goods such as meat, frozen 
foods and the like and therefore equipped with an 
insulated and refrigerated container or compartment, to 
which the following description will refer explicitly 
without thereby limiting its overall scope. Prior art containers for the transport of goods of the 
aforesaid type are normally made of glass-reinforced 
plastics and include a substantially flat floor or 
platform which supports the remaining portion of the 
container and is intended to be fixed to the longitudinal 
members of the chassis of an associated commercial 
vehicle. In order to space this floor from the vehicle wheels, an 
additional profiled section is interposed between the 
floor and each of the longitudinal members, this section 
normally being C-shaped and made of metal and generally 
fixed to the floor by means of a plurality of through-screws  
 
and to the longitudinal members preferably by 
welding or, alternatively by means of bolts. However, the use of the aforesaid C-sections to space the 
floor of the container from the wheels of the associated 
commercial vehicle involves some disadvantages. First of all, as these C-sections are made of metal they 
are relatively heavy, obviously adding to the weight on 
the vehicle chassis and to the overall empty weight of 
the vehicle itself. In addition, the prior mounting of the profiled sections 
on the vehicle chassis and the subsequent fixing of the 
container to the sections involves relatively high 
assembly costs, to which must be added the manufacturing 
and maintenance costs of the sections themselves. 
Finally, the fixing of the floor to the sections by means 
of through-screws compromises the thermal insulation of 
the container as apertures are made in the floor itself 
which put the load space defined by the container into 
communication with the outside. The object of the present invention is to provide a 
container of plastics material for commercial vehicles 
which overcomes the problems described above both simply 
and economically and also proves highly reliable in 
operation.  According to the present invention, there is provided a 
container of plastics material which can be attached to 
a commercial vehicle chassis, this container including a 
bottom defining the floor of the
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A container (6) of plastics material which can be 
attached to a chassis (2) of a commercial vehicle (1), 

the container (6) including a bottom (7) defining the 
floor of the container (6) itself and being characterised 

in that it also includes at least one pair of external 
projections (11; 25) carried by
 the bottom (7) and made 
of plastics material; these projections (11; 25) 

projecting from the bottom (7) and being adapted to bear 
against a portion of the chassis (2) of the vehicle (1), 

means (13; 18; 26) being provided for fixing each of the 
projections (11; 25) to the chassis (2). 
A container according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the projections (11; 25) are made in one piece with 

the bottom (7). 
A container according to either Claim 1 or Claim 2, 
characterised in that the projections (11; 25) extend in 

parallel, transversely spaced positions. 
A container according to any one of the preceding 
Claims, characterised in that the projections (11; 25) 

are straight projections arranged in parallel, 
transversely spaced positions so as each to cooperate in 

use with a respective longitudinal member (3) of the 
vehicle (1). 
A container according to any one of the preceding 
Claims, characterised in that each of the projections 

(11) is a right-angled trapezium in cross-section. 
A container according to any one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that each of the projections (25) is an 

isosceles trapezium in cross-section. 
A container according to any one of the preceding 
Claims, characterised in that the fixing means (13; 26) 

include a plurality of plate attachment elements (14) 
distributed along the respective projections (11; 25) and 

each including a first portion adapted to be securely 
fixed to the chassis (2) and a second portion arranged to 

bear against the respective projection (11; 25); the 
fixing means (13; 26) also including a plurality of 

screws (22) for fixing the second portions to their 
respective projections (11; 25), these screws (22) 

engaging respective holes (17) passing transversely 
through the projections (11; 25) themselves. 
A container according to any one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the fixing means (18) include a 

plurality of pairs of first and second L-shaped brackets 
(19 and 20); the brackets (19) (20) of each pair of 

brackets having respective first limbs securely fixed to 
each other, respective second limbs being securely fixed 

to the projections (11) by means of a plurality of screws 
 

(22) extending through respective holes (17) formed 
transversely in the projections (11) themselves. 
A container according to any one of the preceding 
Claims, characterised in that at least the bottom (7) and 

the projections (11; 25) are made of glass-reinforced 
plastics.
