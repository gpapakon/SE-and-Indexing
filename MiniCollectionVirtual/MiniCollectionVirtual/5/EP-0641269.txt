<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to plasma
arc cutting torches. More specifically it relates to
an improved electrode and insert cooling method for
use in low current, high definition torches.In plasma arc cutting of sheet metal and the
like using air or oxygen as the plasma gas, it is
common to use an insert of a high emissivity material
such as hafnium or zirconium press fit into the bottom
face of a copper electrode. A current is applied to
the electrode. In a transferred arc mode of
operation, a pilot arc is typically formed within the
torch between the electrode and an adjacent nozzle.
The arc then transfers to a workpiece in conjunction
with a ramping up of the arc current to a full
operating value.In all electrodes of this type heretofore in
commercial use, the insert is cylindrical and has a
diameter of about 0.070 inch (17.8 mm) for torches
carrying currents varying from 20 to 260 amperes.
This value was chosen by Hypertherm, Inc., the 
assignee of the present application, in the 1980's during the development
of a 260 ampere oxygen plasma cutting system. It has remained the
standard insert size ever since.While the high emissivity of the insert is very desirable, in practice
standard electrodes with these inserts exhibit an extremely short life when
used at low current levels, e.g. 15 to 70 amperes. This problem is
particularly severe for use in high definition torches where the current
density is typically three to four times than that of a conventional torch
and a strong vortex flow of the plasma gas is used to stabilize the location
of the arc. For example, in an early test of a high definition torch using
the standard insert size, when the operating current was 15 amperes the
hafnium insert exhibited a wear depth of more than 0.762mm (0.030) inch
after only 50 cycles of operation. This high wear rate is observed even
when using the electrode wear reduction techniques described in
U.S.Patent No.5,070,227.French Patent Application FR-A-2173875 is concerned with the
relationship between the nozzle opening and the cathodic element diameter
of a cooled electrode. This document, on which is based the preamble of claims 1 and 11, discloses a cathodic diameter of
8/10 of the nozzle opening as giving a more reliable torch whose essential
components have a longer lifetime.It is therefore a principal object of the present invention to provide
an electrode for plasma arc cutting torch that operates with a reactive
plasma gas at a low operating current level and nevertheless has a useful
life several
