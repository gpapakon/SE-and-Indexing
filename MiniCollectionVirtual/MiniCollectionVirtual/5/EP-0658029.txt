<DESCRIPTION>
The present specification refers to a patent of invention related 
to a hybrid circuit for electric operating and scanning interfaces, 
applicable to electronic recorders of electromechanical 
telephone stations, configuring a union interface between an 
electronic system carrying out the modernization of a station and 
the own station, controlling tension and current parameters on - 
different elements and situations of the station by means of an 
energetic transmission to same. This invention applies to the telecommunications field. The elements carrying out, at present, marking tasks in electromechanic 
stations include a complex variety of circuital situations 
or conditions on the interface with subscriber lines making 
practically impossible, in these systems, to perform modifications 
redounding to a better management of recourses or to a 
satisfactory service quality. Furthermore, these systems include a series of sizeable elements, 
being necessary to carry out bothersome tasks for their 
operation and maintenance. Likewise, these systems are not approachable by subscribers 
having a multifrequence signaling, or through other type of digital 
systems.  Solutions posed with semiconductor switches encounter problems 
in regard to the difficulty about their protection in front of - 
overloads and overvoltages, requiring at the same time a sustantially 
great space and, in turn, their efficiency is very limited 
owing to the fact that, generally, they must be oversized in order 
to act within the foreseen limits, all this with the resulting 
expenditure, both in consumption and physical space, having been 
checked the existence of a large amount of power to be dissipated 
in order to be capable of working in adequate ranges of 
temperature. In front of all these problems, it has been considered as a 
solution to fit the electromechanical systems in the interface 
with digital systems, with structures that, being composed of a 
universal circuit, easily programmable for all the circuital features 
in which it is to intervene, obtain a sustantial reduction 
of size and number of elements to be installed and working under 
adequate conditions as for the energetic consumption and power to 
dissipate, and relying, in turn, on the appropiateguarantees with 
regard to the protections for said circuit. Nevetheless, up to now, nothing is known by the applicant 
about the existence of an invention considering the characteristics 
pointed out as suitable. The hybrid circuit for an electric operating and
