<ABSTRACT>
A container yoke includes four main beams (5) which form the 
yoke frame, and two first extension beams (2) which are 

intended to move in two of said main beams in one direction, 
and two second extension beams (2) which are intended to move 

in the other two main beams in the opposite direction, and a 
first cross-beam (3) which is carried by the two first 

extension beams, and a second cross-beam (3) which is carried 
by the two second extension beams, these cross-beams being 

provided in a conventional manner with lifting hooks for 
gripping a container at its four corners. The invention is 

characterized in that respective cross-beams (3) are attached 
to their two associated extension beams (2) by means of a 

fastener in the form of an elastic coupling (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a container yoke according
to the preamble of claim 1.When handling containers or other types of rigid load-carrying
receptacles of different standard dimensions there is normally
used a yoke or lifting frame which includes a central frame
beam and cross-beams which are mounted on the ends of the
frame beam, on extension beams, and which are able to move in
relation to the frame beam. The free ends of the cross-beams
form the four corners of the container yoke or lifting frame
and have mounted thereon downwardly depending lifting hooks
which can be turned reciprocatingly through ninety degrees
with the aid of a hydraulic system for instance, thereby to
engage and disengage corresponding apertures provided at the
top of the four corners of the container. Because the cross-beams
are able to move, the distance between the cross-beams
can be altered to adjust the container yoke to containers of
different lengths.The weight of the yoke, or lifting frame, together with its
electric and hydraulic assembly, which functions to maneuver
the extension beams and lifting hooks among other things, is
quite considerable. The containers handled may be extremely
heavy. With this in mind and also bearing in mind that all
container yokes, or lifting frames, are handled more or less
roughly, it will be understood that great demands are placed
on the mechanical strength of all carrying parts, so that
these parts will be able to resist the formation of cracks and
other forms of fatigue. This demand is met by dimensioning
all bars, beams and connections so that, wherever possible,
the yoke will be sufficiently strong to withstand all uneven
loads to which the container may be subjected. In the case
of the earlier known technique, two extension beams together
with their respective cross-beams form a welded unit which is
moved into an out of the main beams between positions of 20,40 
and 45 feet in length (standard measurements) . As a result
of the intrinsic weight of the container yoke and the weight
of the load handled, a cross-beam or extension beam will often
be damaged in some way or another, requiring the beam to be
replaced, despite the robust dimensions of the container yoke.
Because two extension beams form a welded unit together with
the cross-beams, any repair work is a time consuming and
expensive operation. Furthermore, the welded unit is
difficult to manufacture, since it is imperative that the
longitudinally extending extension beams are parallel with one
another. This

A container yoke which includes four main beams (1) which
form the yoke frame, and two first extension beams (2) which

are intended to move in two of said main beams in one
direction, and two second extension beams (2) which are

intended to move in the other two main beams in the opposite
direction, and a first cross-beam (3) which is carried by the

two first extension beams, and a second cross-beam (3) which
is carried by the two second extension beams, these cross-beams

being provided in a conventional manner with lifting
hooks for gripping a container at its four corners, characterized

in that respective cross-beams (3) are attached to their
two associated extension beams (2) by means of a fastener in

the form of an elastic coupling (4).
A container yoke according to claim 1, characterized in

that the fastener means between one extension beam (2) and its
associated cross-beam (3) includes two elastic bushings (4);

and in that the extension beam is provided with two flanges
(5) between which a spring (8) mounted on the cross-beam (3)

extends, wherein the fastener means acts between the spring
and the flanges.
A container yoke according to claim 1, characterized in
that the fastener means between a extension beams (2) and its

associated cross-beam (3) includes two elastic bushings (4);
and in that the cross-beam has two flanges between which the

extension beam extends, wherein the fastener means acts
between the extension beam and the flanges.
A container yoke according to any one of claim 1-3,
characterized in that respective elastic couplings (4) include

two mutually concentrical sleeves (19) between which the
elastic material (10) is contained, wherein the outer sleeve

is fixed in the cross-beam (3) or the extension beam (2) and
the inner sleeve is connected to the extension beam (2) or the

cross-beam (3) through the medium of a bolt (11). 
A container yoke according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that for the purpose of moving the

cross-beams (3) each cross-beam is arranged to coact with two
push rods (12) which extend parallel with the main beams (1)

and which can be moved synchronously with one another and each
of which has a length corresponding generally to the length

of the extension beams (2), wherein the inner end of each push
rod distal from the cross-beam (2) carries a guide chain-wheel

(13); in that a push rod (12) from each cross-beam coacts by
virtue of the fact that a first chain (18) having an end which

is fixed (19) in relation to the frame, runs over a guide
chain-wheel (12) of one push rod (12) and back over a chain

wheel (16), whose axle (17) is also fixed in relation to the
frame at said end, whereafter the chain runs to the inner end

of the other push rod (12) and is there fixed (20); in that
