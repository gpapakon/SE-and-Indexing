<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a transparent 
functional film comprising a transparent plastic 

substrate film and a hard coat layer provided thereon, 
wherein functional ultrafine particles are present in a 

highly localized form, thereby enabling the functional 
ultrafine particles to effectively exhibit their function 

and, at the same time, the hard coat layer to have a good 
adhesion to the functional ultrafine particle layer; and 

also an antireflection film and processes for producing 
the transparent functional film and the antireflection 

film. 
A functional ultrafine particle layer 2 is formed on 
a release film 1. Separately, a resin composition for a 

hard coat layer is coated on a transparent plastic 
substrate film 3. The coated release film is laminated 

by press bonding to the coated transparent plastic 
substrate film so that the functional ultrafine particle 

layer 2 faces the resin composition coating, thereby 
causing part of the functional ultrafine particles 5 to 

be embedded in the resin composition coating for a hard 
coat layer. The resultant laminate is cured, and the 

release film 1 is then peeled off. In the resultant 
transparent functional film, the functional ultrafine 

particle layer 2 is partly embedded in and fixed to the 
hard coat layer 4, and the functional ultrafine particles 

5 are localized in the hard coat layer 4 on its surface 
side.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a transparent
functional membrane wherein functional ultrafine
particles having
an
antireflection effect, are localized in a coating (antireflection membrane), a transparent functional film
including the transparent functional membrane
(antireflection film) and a process for producing the
latter.It is known that a transparent functional film
having functions, such as a UV screening property, an
antistatic property, or an antireflection property, can
be produced by coating on a transparent plastic substrate
film a transparent resin composition with functional
ultrafine particles having particular properties, such as
a UV screening effect, an antistatic effect, and an
antireflection effect, being dispersed therein, thereby
forming a functional coating.Further, it is also known that, in order to impart
additional properties, such as scratch resistance and
chemical resistance, to the above transparent functional
film, a transparent functional film having a hard
property can be produced by forming as an intermediate
layer a hard coat layer of, for example, an ionizing
radiation curing resin on a transparent plastic substrate
film and coating thereon a transparent resin composition 
with functional ultrafine particles being dispersed
therein.In the transparent functional film containing the
above functional ultrafine particles, the functional
ultrafine particles are present in a dispersed form in a
transparent functional membrane due to the nature of the
process. The incorporation of a larger amount of
functional ultrafine particles in the membrane can
further enhance the function of the functional ultrafine
particles. In this case, however, the filling ratio of
the functional ultrafine particles dispersed in the resin
should be increased, making it difficult to form a film.
Further, the transparent functional film having a hard
coat layer of an ionizing radiation curing resin or the
like has a problem that the adhesion between the hard
coat layer and the transparent functional membrane is so
low that the transparent functional membrane is likely to
peel off.An object of the present invention
is to provide a transparent functional membrane,
wherein functional ultrafine particles having an antireflection effect are localized in a
high density as a functional ultrafine particle layer in
a hard coat layer, thereby enabling the function of the
functional ultrafine particles to be developed and, at
the same time, the hard coat layer and the functional
ultrafine particles to have
