<ABSTRACT>
A method and article for microwave bonding of thermoplastic pipe such as that used in the distribution of natural gas. The article is a composite bonding material (CBM) having a thermoplastic matrix (14) (preferably polyethylene) which is miscible with the thermoplastic material of the pipe (20) and a plurality of microwave susceptor particles (11) dispersed throughout the matrix (14). The preferred susceptors have improved heating properties whereby the total amount of metal oxide material in the CBM is about 1/10 of 1 % by weight. A strip or sleeve (24) is fashioned from the CBM and may be used, with or without a coupling, to join two pipes (20) or repair ruptures. The method includes positioning of the article at the pipe joint or rupture, and application of microwave energy in an amount sufficient to heat the susceptors and cause both the CBM matrix and the adjacent portion of the pipe to melt and flow together, thereby producing a fusion bond.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of
pending U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 07/588,591
filed September 26, 1990, which is a continuation-in-part
of U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 07/335,044 filed
April 7, 1989, now abandoned.The present invention generally relates to
methods and devices used to attach structural members,
and more particularly to a method and article for fusion
bonding conduits formed of polyolefin materials, such as
polyethylene pipes used for natural gas distribution.Conventional distribution systems for natural
gas use polyethylene pipes of varying diameters to
transport the gas from suppliers to end users. There is
a continual problem regarding leakage in such pipe
systems due to inadequate joining of pipe sections, or
due to ruptures which may occur in the pipes after
placement in the ground. Such joining, and repair of
ruptures, was at one time accomplished by the use of
various adhesives (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 3,826,521),
but this was generally unacceptable due to the difficult
adherence characteristics of polyethylene which would
result, after a long period of time, in cracks in the
cured adhesive or separation of the adhesive from the
pipe surface. Indeed, bonding nearly anything to
polyethylene is very difficult, as recognized in U.S.
Patent No. 3,143,364.Another technique for fitting pipes together
involves the use of electro-fusion couplers (see, e.g.,
U.S. Patent No. 4,486,650). These couplers overcome the
adherence properties of the polyolefin compositions by 
being formed of the same thermoplastic material as the
conduits to be joined. An electrical resistance heating
element is molded into the coupler, along the inner
surface thereof, and upon energization of the element by
direct current, it raises the temperature of the
thermoplastic material in both the coupler and the
adjacent pipes which have been fitted within the coupler.
The material of the coupler and the pipes then flows
together and fuses as it cools. As with other prior art
techniques, however, electrofusion couplers often do not
create a complete seal and the entire process must
sometimes be repeated. Electrofusion couplers are also
relatively expensive and consequently have not gained
widespread use.Fusing of the pipes may also be accomplished by
the use of special films which may be applied to the
joint or rupture and heated to flow with the pipe
material. For example, Patent Cooperation Treaty
