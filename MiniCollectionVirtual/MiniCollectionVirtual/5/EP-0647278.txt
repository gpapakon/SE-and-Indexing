<ABSTRACT>
In a method for molecular-biological analysis of genetic material, a genomic DNA or RNA preparation is tested for the presence of mutations. The processed DNA or RNA preparation is contacted with a first set(s) of interconnected solid phase members (5) supporting oligonucleotide primers to bind a defined DNA or RNA fragment that may contain a stable mutation to each solid phase member, and/or with a second set(s) of interconnected solid phase members (5) supporting oligonucleotide primers to bind a defined DNA or RNA fragment that may contain an unstable mutation or several stable mutations to each solid phase member. The solid phase members (5) of the first set(s) are introduced into a matching first set(s) of interconnected receptacles (7) with reaction mixtures for producing products which contain an incorporated marker when a supported DNA or RNA fragment has a mutation. The solid phase members (5) of the second set(s) are introduced into a matching second set(s) of interconnected receptacles (7) containing reaction mixtures for performing sequencing reactions. The contents of the presence of a marker indicating stable mutations is determined from the first set(s) of receptacles, and the sequence of the DNA or RNA fragments is determined from the second set(s) of receptacles. On the basis of these analyses, the genetic status of the genomic DNA or RNA material is determined. A system for performing such analyses is also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to molecular-biological
diagnostics, and more particularly to a novel method and
system for analysing mutations or well-defined genetic
events in coding DNA-sequences or corresponding RNA-sequences.The mammalian gene structure is based on coding DNA-sequences
(exons) and intervening sequences (introns).
Disturbances or changes (mutations) in the coding sequences
result in abnormal gene products and thus malfunction and
disease. Today, more than 4500 diseases are known which are
due to defects in single genes. Such defects may be stable
mutations, i.e. they always occur in specific, predictable
positions, but may also be unstable genetic events
occurring at one or more of a number of different
unpredictable locations in the gene. In many cases the
cause of a specific genetic disease may be stable or
unstable events in any one of a number of exons. Detailed
genetic information on an individual will tell about the
susceptibility for disease, confirm inherited disorders,
confirm disease status and serve as a guidance for more
efficient treatment.In the case of stable and thereby predictable
mutations, methods permitting the determination of a
specific polynucleotide sequence may be used, whereas the
detection of unstable genetic events will require a DNA (or
RNA) sequencing operation on the exon or exons in question.
It is readily understood that with current methods, the
determination of genetic diseases which may be due to one
of several possible stable and unstable mutations will be
laborious and time-consuming, requiring inter alia a great
number of pipetting operations. The reproducibility will
therefore be highly dependent on the skill of the operator.
Besides, only a few commercial tests are available today
for such genetic diseases, which tests, apart from being
relatively complicated to perform, have a rather low
accuracy. European patent application EP 326 989 describes a method
of bacterial identification including the steps of
preparing single-stranded DNA from bacterial strains;immobilising the single-stranded DNA in containers;adding labeled single-stranded DNA from a bacteria which is
to be identified;performing hybridysation and determining the degree of
hybridisation.The present invention provides a method
and kit, as defined in the appended claims 1 and 8, respectively, for molecular-biological
diagnostics, which are devoid of the disadvantages of the
prior art methods for molecular-biological diagnostics and
which permit exon-specific determination of stable
