<ABSTRACT>
Proteins are prepared in reactor A by the reaction of a hydrocarbon utilizing 
microbe on a low molecular weight hydrocarbon, such as methane, in an 

aqueous medium in the presence of oxygen and a fixable nitrogen compound. 
Protein is recovered in Unit B, and a gaseous dioxide is passed from the reactor 

A to the separator C where it is separated by pressure swing adsorption in one 
or two stages, so as to form a carbon dioxide stream and to recycle unreacted 

hydrocarbon and oxygen to the reactor A. Sufficient hydrocarbon is introduced 
into the system to prevent the formation of a flammable mixture therein. Part or 

all of the hydrocarbon can be introduced into the system downstream of the 
reactor A, where the propensity for forming a flammable gas mixture is greatest.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the production of proteins, and more particularly to a 
recycle process for the manufacture of proteins by the biochemical oxidation of 
gaseous hydrocarbons in the presence of a nitrogenous nutrient. Proteins can be produced by the microbial conversion of hydrocarbons under 
fermentation conditions. In conducting such conversions a hydrocarbon is 
contacted in an aqueous medium containing a nitrogen source and other desired 
nutrients with an oxygen-containing gas. The protein produced in the reaction 
remains in the aqueous medium and unused oxygen and byproduct carbon 
dioxide are removed from the reaction as a gas phase. More recently, it has 
been discovered that greater protein yields are realized when the conversion is 
carried out using an enriched oxygen-containing gas; accordingly, later 
hydrocarbon conversion processes are conducted using oxygen-enriched air or 
high purity oxygen as the oxygen-containing gas. Since the reaction occurs in the aqueous phase and the solubility of oxygen in 
water is relatively low, it is desirable to use excess oxygen-containing gas to 
effect reasonable conversion rates. When an oxygen-enriched gas or 
substantially pure oxygen is used as the oxygen source it is important for 
economic reasons to recover unused oxygen-enriched gas. US-A-3,833,477, 
discloses the separation of oxygen from water vapour and carbon dioxide 
contained in a gaseous effluent stream from an aerobic fermenter by cooling the 
gaseous effluent and condensing water vapour and carbon dioxide from the 
gaseous effluent. The separated oxygen can then be recycled to the fermenter. 
US-A-4,690,696 discloses the separation by pressure swing adsorption of 
oxygen from carbon dioxide in an organic substance fermenter effluent gas 
stream, and recycle of the recovered oxygen to the fermenter. Harrison, "Making Protein from Methane", Chemtech, September, 1976, pp 
570-574, and Klass et al., "Key Process Factors in the Microbial Conversion of 
Methane to Protein", Chemical Engineering Progress Symposium Series, No. 93, 
Vol. 65 (1969), pp 72-79 describe the metabolism of methane to protein 
concentrate by means of a methane utilizing microbe. There is no discussion of 
recovery of unused oxygen or methane in either of these articles. A continuous  
 
reaction process for converting methane to protein by the reaction of methane 
with oxygen and nutrients in the presence of methane-utilizing bacteria is 
disclosed in an article entitled "A Fairytale in Odense", appearing in
