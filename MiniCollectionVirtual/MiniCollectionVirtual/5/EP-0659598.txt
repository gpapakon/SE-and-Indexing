<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus and method for controlling damping 

force characteristics of respective vehicular shock 
absorbers (SAFL-RR) in which vehicular vertical behavior(s) at the 

position(s) of the vehicular body which are forward by a 
predetermined distance from a tread of rear left and 

right road wheels are determined, the positions including 
front left and right road wheel sides, and corresponding 

vertical behavior signals are derived. Control signals 
for front left and right and rear left and right road 

wheel side shock absorbers are formed on the basis of 
respective processed signals having frequency-dependent 

characteristics formed from the vehicular behavior 
signal(s). The damping force characteristics of front 

left and right road wheel side shock absorbers are 
controlled on the basis of the control signals formed on 

the basis of the processed signal based on the front left 
and right road wheel vehicular behavior signals. Those 

of rear left and right road wheel side shock absorbers 
are controlled on the basis of the control signals formed 

on the basis of the processed signals based on the front 
position vehicular vertical behavior signal at the 

position forward from the tread between the rear left and 
right road wheels. The phases of the control signals V 

are generally matched with vehicular behavior velocity 
signals which would actually be generated at rear road 

wheel arranged positions of the vehicle.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus 
and method for optimally controlling damping force 
characteristics of four tire wheel suspension units 
(shock absorbers) of an automotive vehicle. A Japanese Patent Application First Publication 
No. Heisei 4-191111 published on July 9, 1992 exemplifies 
a previously proposed damping force characteristic 
control apparatus for respective shock absorbers 
interposed between a corresponding vehicular body (sprung 
mass) and tire wheel assemblies (unsprung mass). In the above-identified Japanese Patent 
Application Publication, a plurality of actuators (shock 
absorbers) each interposed between the vehicle body and a 
rear tire (road) wheel so as to enable an increase or 
decrease in a suspension force (damping force 
characteristic) on the vehicle body with respect to the 
corresponding rear tire (road) wheel, a vertical 
acceleration sensor arranged so as to detect a vertical 
acceleration acted upon the vehicle body due to a 
vibration input from front tire wheels caused by a recess 
and convex formed on a road surface on which the vehicle 
is running, a vehicle speed sensor arranged so as to 
detect the vehicle speed, and control unit arranged so as 
to control operations of the actuators on the basis of 
input signals from the above-described sensors are 
provided in the vehicular suspension control apparatus. The control unit described above is so 
constructed as to actuate the actuators, when determining 
that the vehicular body vertical acceleration detected  
 
from each of the vertical acceleration sensors exceeds a 
predetermined value, calculates a delay duration in time 
for which the rear road wheels have reached to the 
corresponding recess and convex of the road surface which 
has given the sprung mass vertical acceleration which 
exceeds the predetermined value and actuates the 
actuators described above according to the magnitude of 
the control signal derived by inverting a signal based on 
the vertical sprung mass acceleration after the 
calculated delay duration in time has passed upon passage 
of the front tire (road) wheels on the recess and convex 
of the road surface. That is to say, in the above-identified 
Japanese Patent Application First Publication, even when 
a relatively large vibration occurs on the vehicle body 
at the time when the front road tire wheels have passed 
such a recess and convex of the road surface as described 
above, the control for the rear road wheel side shock 
absorbers is carried out so as to cancel the
