<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical
semiconductor device and a method of manufacturing the
same and more particularly to an optical semiconductor
device having a high output semiconductor laser used for
a light source of an information processing unit such as
an optical printer and an optical disk unit, a
semiconductor laser amplifier used for light
amplification, an optical active element such as a
semiconductor laser used in a transmitter of an optical
communication apparatus or a photodiode used in a
receiver thereof and an optical waveguide, and a method
of manufacturing the same.With the advance of semiconductor communication
techniques, production techniques of semiconductor lasers have also been
improved, and research into integration of
semiconductor laserswith other optical semiconductor
elements are being made extensively in recent years. For
example, an apparatus in which a DFB (distributed
feedback) laser and a light modulator are integrated and
an apparatus in which a DBR (distributed Bragg reflector)
laser and a mode transducer (a beam size converter) are
integrated, are available.A mode transducer is a mechanism for narrowing
an output beam of a semiconductor laser originally having
an output angle as wide as 30 to 40 degrees, and for
facilitating optical coupling in the case in which a semiconductor
laser and an optical fiber are formed into a module.In a semiconductor laser, the more intense the
optical confinement of an optical waveguide is, i.e., the
smaller a light spot diameter is, the smaller an oscillation 
threshold becomes, and a luminous efficiency is
improved. As the light spot diameter gets smaller,
however, coupling with the optical fiber becomes more
difficult.Further, a semiconductor laser requiring a high
output, such as a laser for exciting a fiber type optical
amplifier using an optical fiber doped with erbium or a
semiconductor laser for writing information in a optical
disk, suffers from the problem that an optical power density
rises at a laser end face and damage to the end face is
liable to be caused. Furthermore, a semiconductor
laser amplifier may have the drawback that the optical
output is saturated easily when beam confinement is
intense.Photodiodes that have a rapid speed of
response and a high quantum efficiency are required, and
furthermore, photodiodes that can be formed into a thin shape and that
can permit convenient electrical wiring are demanded.An end face incidence waveguide type photodiode
is available as a photodiode which meets these
