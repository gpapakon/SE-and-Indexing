<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for continuously separating desirable and undesirable substances in a fibrous suspension, for example for continuously cleaning a fibre suspension intended for the production of paper, board and the like on a paper machine, in which an inflow stream of the fibre suspension is led into a distribution region and is subdivided there into a number of at least approximately equal partial streams, these partial streams then passing through their own a cleaning process, a good stock stream, containing the desirable materials and a bad stock stream ("rejects") containing the undesirable materials being formed from the partial streams by means of a separating process based on the utilisation of centrifugal force and the good stock streams and the bad stock streams in each case being united in a collecting region. The invention is characterised in that the subdivision of the inflow stream of the fibrous suspension into partial streams is undertaken simultaneously for all the partial streams and is thereby effected in a vibrationally damping manner on the fibrous suspension.

Method for the continuous separation of
desirable substances from undesirable substances in a

substance suspension, in which an inflow stream of the
fibre suspension is led into a central distribution

region (4) and is simultaneously divided there into a
number of at least approximately equal part-streams,

these part-streams then each run separately through a
cleaning process, in which, by means of a separating

process based on the utilization of centrifugal force,
in each case a good-substance stream containing the

desirable substances and a bad-substance stream
containing the undesirable substances are formed from

the part-streams, and the good-substance streams and
the bad-substance streams are subsequently combined in

each case in a collecting region (16; 18),
characterized by vibration-damping action on the

substance suspension by means of an air cushion (5) in
the distribution region (4), the said air cushion being

kept under pressure.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the pressure of the inflow stream in the

distribution region (4) is kept at a uniform level by
regulating the pressure of the air cushion (5).
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that the good-substance streams are simultaneously

brought together in order to form a common outflow
stream. 
Method according to Claim 3, characterized in
that the light substances and air contained in the

good-substance streams are removed from the good
substance after the good-substance streams have been

brought together.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 4,

characterized in that the good-substance streams are
simultaneously brought together in order to form a

common outflow stream and are swirled into a vortex,
and light substances and air are removed at the centre

of the vortex.
Device for the continuous separation of
desirable substances from undesirable substances in a

substance suspension, comprising a central distributor
(1) with a container (4), the outflow of which has a

plurality of distributor connections (8) opening out at
a height above an inflow orifice (2) and transversely

to the vertical axis of the container (4), a plurality
of cleaning devices (11) arranged in the form of a star

around the distributor (1), for example tubular
centrifuges, fluidized separators and the like, which

are also designated as cleaners, and a plurality,
corresponding to the number of cleaning devices (11),

of at least approximately identical connecting conduits
(9), via which the cleaning devices (11) are connected

in each case to a distribution connection (8) of the
distributor (1), characterized in that the distributor

(1) has a damping device comprising a perforated plate,
arranged above the inflow orifice (2) and below the

distributor connections (8) in the container (4), and
means (5) for maintaining a predetermined pressure of

an air volume located in the container (4) above the
regulated liquid level, the outflow of the distributor

(1) being arranged below the liquid level (6).
Device according to Claim 6, characterized in
that the good-substance conduits (14) leading away from

the cleaning devices (9) and carrying cleaned fibre
suspension open into a common collecting container

(16). 
Device according to Claim 7, characterized in
that the good-substance conduits (14) open

approximately tangentially into the collecting
container (16) of approximately round cross section.
Device according to Claim 7 or 8, characterized
in that the distributor (1) and the collecting

container (16) form a structural unit.
Device according to one of Claims 7 to 11,
characterized in that the collecting container (16) is

arranged on the distributor and damping device (1).
Device according to one of Claims 7 to 10,
characterized in that a conduit for light-substance and

air exhaust air (20) opens into the collecting
container (16).
Device according to one of Claims 6 to 11,
characterized in that the connecting conduits (9)

leading from the distributor (1) to the cleaning
devices (11) can be shut off in each case via a valve

(23).
Device according to one of Claims 6 to 13,
characterized in that the pressure of the air cushion

(5) above the liquid level (6) in the distributor (1)
can be set via a control.
Device according to one of Claims 6 to 13,
characterized in that the bad-substance streams leading

away from the cleaning devices (9) open into a common
collecting chamber (18).
