<ABSTRACT>
A torque sensor, or relative angular movement 
sensor, capable of measuring the angular displacement 

of a component in a power-assisted steering system, 
comprises an input member (5) coupled to one end of a 

torsion bar (4), an output member (2) coupled to 
another end of the torsion bar, LED light sources (20), 

a pair of photodetector units (28a,28b) adapted to 
receive light from the LED light sources, and signal 

processing means adapted to receive output 
signals (A1,A2,B1,B2) from the photodetector units, the 

output signals of the photodetector units being 
dependent upon the light signals which they receive, 

and wherein the signal processing means is adapted to 
produce a modified output signal (Q
new
) which closely 
matches and is representative of the angular position 

of a chosen portion of the torsion bar. The signal 
processing comprises various stages in which the output 

signals from the photodetector units are processed to 
generate possible estimates of the instantaneous 

position of the chosen portion of the torsion bar and 
the best estimate (P and) is calculated and processed to 

provide a complete position estimate representing the 
angular position of the chosen portion relative to an 

arbitrarily chosen zero position.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to improvements in signal
processing in optical torque sensors which are
especially, but not exclusively, for incorporation in
power-assisted steering systems for vehicles.In our European patent application no. 93300792.4 (EP-A2,3-555 987 published 18,8,93),
a torque sensor is described which comprises an input
member, an output member, emitter means, first receiver
means adapted to receive a first signal, second
receiver means adapted to receive a second signal, and
signal processing means, in which said signal
processing means is adapted to receive output signals
from the first and second receiver means, the output
signals of the receiver means being dependent upon the
first and second signals which they receive, and the
signal processing means being adapted to process the
output signals from the first and second receiver means
so as to produce a modified output signal indicative of
the relative angular displacement between, or torque
applied between, the input and output member. In a
described embodiment of the invention input and output
masks are associated with the input and output members
respectively, interposed between the emitter means and
the first and second receiver means. In this
embodiment preferably the first or second receiver
means comprise first and second effective receivers
respectively and the masks each comprise an
equi-angularly spaced set of apertures, the masks
having equal aperture pitch and each aperture
subtending substantially half an aperture pitch at the
central axis of the respective mask, the aperture pitch
being defined as the total angle subtended by one
opaque and one transparent region of the mask. The torque sensor may be used in a power-assisted
steering system for a vehicle. In such a system the
output signals from the first and second receiver means
may be processed to determine the rate of rotation of
the vehicle steering shaft and a digital position
measurement of the angular displacement of the steering
shaft. This information can be used in a vehicle
control microprocessor to modify or control the
suspension and/or braking characteristics of the
vehicle.A disadvantage of the digital position measurement
scheme for measuring the angular displacement of the
steering shaft, described in our European Patent
Application No. 93300792.4, is that the position
indication provided is strictly valid only for a point
halfway along the torsion bar which connects the input
and output members of the described embodiments of the
invention, rather than
