<ABSTRACT>
A watch capable of displaying 
biorhythm and others in a mode visually 

appealing. A plurality of stepping motors 
move a plurality of hands to display biorhythm. 

Each has made one revolution when the 
corresponding stepping motor takes a given 

number of steps. The driving of the stepping 
motor is controlled so that one revolution is 

completed exactly in synchronism with the 
cycle of the biorhythm.

<DESCRIPTION>
Various types of watches which display biorhythms have been demonstrated. For
example, those which digitally display the respective values of PSI (such as Japanese
Patent Laid-Open No. Showa 64-10861), those which use curves and a cursor in order to
show where in the cycle of PSI the current day falls (such as Japanese Patent Laid-Open
No. Showa 62-32429), and those which display PSI on a graph.However, when displaying the respective PSI rhythms by numerical values, there
was the disadvantage that it was difficult to grasp the condition of the various rhythms,
that is, whether they were in a downswing, an upswing, or a caution day.On the other hand, those analog displaying the respective PSI with a long hand,
short hand, and second hand of a watch displayed in a liquid crystal display device have
been invented, but there was the problem of reduced visibility because the respective
rhythms were displayed on the same character panel. Furthermore, there was the
problem that if it was forgotten which hand corresponded to which rhythm, the condition
of the biorhythm was absolutely unable to be known.This invention, taking the above conditions into consideration, has as its objective
the introduction of an electronic watch which has the ability to clearly display make
easily comprehensible such information as a biorhythm. According to the present invention, there is provided an electronic watch with
means for displaying at least a biorhythm characterised by having
a timekeeping means for keeping track of the present time including the year,
month and date,a biorhythm calculation means for calculating a plurality of biorhythms for the
present time kept by said timekeeping means based on birthday information;a plurality of display means for analog displaying said plurality of biorhythms;a determination means for determining, on the basis of the values calculated by
said biorhythm calculation means, display order of the biorhythms in the display means
to be the order of the calculated values; anda display control means for analog displaying each biorhythm on a separate
display means so that a single rotation corresponds to a single period of each biorhythm,
based on the results of the determination made by said determination means.Figure 1 is a block diagram showing the composition of a biorhythm display
watch according to the first embodiment of this invention, Figure 2 is a diagonal view
showing the positional relationship of the small watches in the same embodiment,Figure 3 is an outside view of the
