<ABSTRACT>
A non-alcoholic, aqueous mouthwash composition is provided which contains a dispersion system containing a non-ionic surfactant selected from a hydrogenated castor oil and a polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene block copolymer having about 50 % to about 90 % ethylene oxide, a humectant and a cationic antimicrobial agent. The composition exhibits a homogeneous, uniform appearance and a high degree of bacterial efficacy.

 NON-ALCOHOLIC AQUEOUS MOUTHWASHBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the InventionThis invention relates to a non-alcoholic, aqueous mouthwash composition. More particularly, the present invention relates to a non-alcoholic mouthwash composition which exhibits a homo¬ geneous, uniform appearance and a high degree of bactericidal efficacy.Description of the ArtMouthwashes and oral rinse compositions have been used for many years and the art is replete with various compositions and formulations. Ordinarily, mouthwashes have been designed to clean the oral cavity, provide fresh breath and kill harmful bacteria. It is generally necessary to kill certain oral bacteria that contribute to malodor or secrete acidic residues which are harmful to teeth and aid in the development of gingi¬ vitis and periodontal disease.Conventional mouthwashes contain a fairly high percentage of ethyl alcohol ranging from 10% to 30% by weight of the total composition. This alcohol is used both as a disinfectant and as a solvent in which other additives such as flavoring oils, color additives, fluorides and astringents can be dissolved and then dispersed into the aqueous solution. In fact, more than 95% of commercial mouthwash compositions contain greater that 15% by 

weight alcohol. These high concentrations of ethyl alcohol are primarily used to kill oral bacteria since lower concentrations are generally adequate to disperse the additives into the aqueous solution.However, the use of alcohol in mouthwash compositions has detrimental or undesirable side effects for many user groups. For example, many people cannot tolerate alcohol and must, for medical and health reasons, avoid the use of mouthwash composi¬ tions containing alcohol. Further, young children and persons over the age of sixty are extremely susceptible to health risks when ingesting large quantities of alcohol. Generally, recover¬ ing alcoholics must avoid oral contact with alcohol as well as persons of certain religious beliefs. Last, those persons afflicted by dry-mouth syndrome or using certain medications, often prefer to avoid alcohol containing mouthwash compositions since the alcohol tends to remove moisture from the oral tissues and complicate the dry-mouth syndrome or feeling.Various attempts have been made at developing non-alcoholic mouthwashes. For example, U.S. Patents 4,919,918 to Cole et al and 4,971,785 to Wilson et al are directed to a non-alcoholic delivery system which can be used in mouthwashes. However, these patents are primarily directed to dry
