<ABSTRACT>
Polytetrafluoroethylene micropowders, which may contain up to 3 % by weight of comonomers, are obtained in a narrow molecular weight distribution, a narrow specific surface area range and a primary particle size of from 150 to 250 nm by polymerisation in aqueous medium with hydrogen, methane or ethane as chain-transfer agent, where the supply of free radicals remains essentially constant over the polymerisation time. These micropowders are particularly suitable for the preparation of polyacetals which form only slight deposits in the mould during melt processing and have increased colour stability.

<CLAIMS>
A polytetrafluoroethylene micropowder containing 
up to about 3% by weight of monomers 

copolymerizable with tetrafluoroethylene, which 
has a polydispersity M
w
/M
n
 of from 1.5 to 2.5 and a 
specific surface area (BET) of from 7 to 13 m
2
/g, 
produced from a dispersion having a primary 

particle size of from 150 to 250 nm. 
A micropowder as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
polydispersity is from 1.5 to 2. 
A micropowder as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein 
the copolymerizable monomer is a lower perfluoro-(alkyl 

vinyl) ether or hexafluoropropene. 
A process for preparing the micropowder as claimed 
in claim 1, 2 or 3, which comprises polymerizing 

tetrafluoroethylene, with or without a monomer 
copolymerizable therewith, in aqueous medium in 

the presence of hydrogen, methane or ethane as 
chain transfer agent and inorganic initiators at 

an availability of free radicals remaining 
essentially constant over the polymerization time. 
The process as claimed in claim 4, wherein the 
initiator used is a persulfate or permanganate. 
The process as claimed in claim 4 or 5, wherein 
the polymerization is carried out using alkali 

metal or ammonium persulfate at from 50 to 90°C. 
The process as claimed in claim 4 or 5, wherein 
the polymerization is carried out using an alkali 

metal permanganate at temperatures of from 20 to 
40°C.  

 
Use of the micropowder as claimed in any of claims 
1 to 3 or the micropowder obtained by the process 

claimed in any of claims 4 to 7 for the production 
of polyacetal preparations. 
A preparation comprising a polyacetal and a 
micropowder as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3 or 

a micropowder obtained by the process claimed in 
any of claims 4 to 7. 
Use of a preparation as claimed in claim 9 for the 
production of moldings by melt processing.
