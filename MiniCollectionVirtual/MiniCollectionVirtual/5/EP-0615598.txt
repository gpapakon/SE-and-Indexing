<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus, and method of operating the apparatus, wherein a feed material is converted into a glassified condition for subsequent use or disposal. The apparatus is particularly useful for disposal of hazardous or noxious waste materials which are otherwise either difficult or expensive to dispose of. The apparatus is preferably constructed by excavating a melt zone in a quantity of soil or rock, and lining the melt zone with a back fill material if refractory properties are needed. The feed material is fed into the melt zone and, preferably, combusted to an ash, whereupon the heat of combustion is used to melt the ash to a molten condition. Electrodes may be used to maintain the molten feed material in a molten condition, and to maintain homogeneity of the molten materials.

<DESCRIPTION>
The need for devices to effectively treat and
dispose of waste materials without creating undue environmental
contamination has been recognized for many
years. Incinerators have been used to reduce municipal
solid wastes to ash which must then be disposed of by
conventional means, such as burial in a land fill.
Incinerators have also been either used for, or proposed
for, the disposal of other forms of commonly occurring
waste products, such as medical wastes, low level nuclear
wastes, hazardous organic or inorganic chemical wastes,
etc.For example, U.S. Pat. No 4,299,611 discloses an
incinerator for converting hazardous materials to a
relatively harmless condition. Feed material, at least a
portion of which is combustible, is directed into a
conversion chamber and onto glass which is molten in the
lower portion of the chamber. The waste is broken down
into an ash component and a gaseous component. A portion
of the ash settles into the molten glass, which is
discharged to a cooling area to form a solid waste-glass
product. Metallic portions of the waste are oxidized to
metal oxides and then incorporated into the molten glass.A number of other incinerator-type devices have been
proposed to dispose of asbestos waste. In U.S. Pat. No.
4,820,328, asbestos is converted into a glass by mixing
the asbestos with cullet and a melt accelerator, and
introducing the mixture onto a quantity of molten glass
in a furnace, thereby decomposing the asbestos. The
molten glass/decomposed asbestos is withdrawn from the 
furnace at about 1000°C. Likewise, in U.S. Pat. No.
4,678,493, asbestos is converted into a vitreous glass by
introducing the asbestos into a two-chambered furnace.
Glass is made from feed materials and cullet in a two-chambered
furnace that is both electrically and gas fired
in U.S. Pat. No. 4,831,633. Finally, an advanceable tin
oxide electrode which can be advanced into additional
sections of the furnace as the electrode advances so that
the whole of the electrode material needed in a furnace
campaign does not have to be present at the outset of the
campaign, is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,897,853.Waste materials for input into incinerators or other
treatment means may take many varied forms. Such wastes
may be combustible or noncombustible, solid or liquid.
Regardless of the form of the waste upon entry into the
treatment means, it must be converted into a form that
can be used or disposed of without environmental insult.
Depending upon the chemical constituents in the wastes,
they must either be
