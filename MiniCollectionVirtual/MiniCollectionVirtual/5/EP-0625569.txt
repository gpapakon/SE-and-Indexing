<ABSTRACT>
The contrast chamber for spotlighting bacterial colonies with respect to their culture medium performs the automatic 
counting, through the use of an automatic processor connected to a reading head (7), of bacterial colonies which develop 

in the capsules wherein the culture takes place; additionally, it also provides for the automatic introduction of the capsules (5) inside 
the contrast chamber. The contrast chamber is provided with lateral lighting means, using the light reflected by a reflection 

tube (2) and emitted by a lighting source (1) positioned above the capsule (5) which has been closed by a lid provided with an 
opaque disc (3). The reading head (7) is positioned under the capsule (5) and is associated to a second light source (8) which 

moves together with the reading head and which is inclined with respect to the surface of the capsule (5), so that the light beams 
do not impinge on the reading head (7). In the proximity of the contrast chamber there ae provided means (12) for housing in ordered 

arrangement a plurality of capsules (5) in order to improve the handling and automatic introduction of said capsules (5) 
into the contrast chamber.

<DESCRIPTION>
As is expressed in the title of this specification,
the present invention consists of a contrast chamber to
spotlight bacterial colonies with regard to the culture
medium of the same; whose purpose is to furnish the
automatic count by means of an automatic processor, of
the bacterial colonies that are grown in the dishes where
the culture is made. Another purpose of the invention consists
of permitting the automatic introduction of a plurality
of dishes in the contrast chamber.The arrangement, number and form of the bacterial colonies
grown after the culture is easily appreciable, upon
making the contrast, it being possible to use an electronic
image pickup, such as a scanner or other device or optical
camera that can carry out the final operation of reading
and transcribing the image from the dish to the automatic
processor to determine the number of bacterial colonies
grown, and to show the image obtained on a screen where the
bacteria appear represented in a bright color, so that the
visual verification of the count of the same is provided.The practice of making bacterial cultures to determine
the number of type of bacteria present in food, pharmaceutical
products, etc. is conventionally known.Now then, the bacterial culture medium is made in some
dishes that are known as Petri dishes in which a base product
that consists of a gelled agar-agar solution that constitutes
food for the bacteria is placed, upon which an
extract of the product to be analyzed is placed.subsequently the dish is placed in an oven to favor
the reproduction of the bacteria, creating different colonies
from each microorganism present in the extract of the
product to be analyzed. The problem that arises afterwards consists of making
the count of colonies created, in order to establish the
amount of bacteria that was contained in the analyzed product.Conventionally (cf., for example, US-A-3,712,746) the count is made visually directly or
by means of a magnifying glass, which makes it a task that
requires a great visual effort and a great deal of concentration,
thus, the probability that errors are made in the
counts made is considerable, a probability that increases
when the operator has to make the count of countless bacterial
cultures, since this operation really tires out the
person who has to carry it out.Besides, automatic counting apparatus of bacterial
colonies that are based on illuminating the dish and on
detecting the image of the same, by means of a video camera
cf. US-A-3,811,036, exist. These devices have the problem

<CLAIMS>
Device with a contrast chamber to

in which the culture is made by means of an automatic
processor (11) connected to a reading head (7); whereby


said chamber comprises lighting means (1, 8)
to illuminate said dishes (5) from non-parallel planes to

the pickup plane of said reading head (7); and
said reading head (7) is positioned under
said dish (5), separated from the same by a perfectly

transparent means;

   
characterized in that
at least one dark shaded opaque disk (3) is
positioned above said dish (5), which may or may not be in

contact with the same, in a horizontal plane above and
opposite the horizontal plane in which said reading head

(7) is positioned and/or moved.
Device according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that
said lighting means are a light source (1) positioned vertically

above said disk element (3) and in that the inside surfaces
of the vertical walls (2) of said chamber are reflective, so

that said disk element (3) obstructs the top area of said
dish from the light rays (4) given off by said source (1),

which fall upon said inside surfaces of said walls (2) and
are reflected from said surfaces and illuminate sideways

said dish (5.)
Device according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that
said lighting means are of a light source (8) positioned in

said reading head (7) in a slanted position in terms of the
horizontal plane of the dish (5) in such a way that the rays

(10) reflected by the base of the dish do not fall upon the
reading head (7.)
Device according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that
said lighting means are a plurality of lamps placed horizon-tally 

and laterally with respect to said dish.
Device according to claims 1, 2 and 3, 
characterized
