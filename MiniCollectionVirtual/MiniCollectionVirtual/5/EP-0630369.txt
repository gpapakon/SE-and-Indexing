<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to certain 
benzimidazole anthelmintic agents which, quite 
unexpectedly, are topically and parenterally active and 
are thus suitable for transdermal and parenteral 
(especially intramuscular) administration. These benzimidazole derivatives are represented by 
the formula:- 
 
and their non-toxic salts, in which 
R is H, -CO2(C1-C10 alkyl), -CO2(cholester-3-yl) 
or a group of the formula -CO2(CH2)nCOOH or 
-CO2(CH2)nCO2(C1-C6alkyl) in which n is an integer of from 
1 to 10; R1 is either (i) benzoyl, phenyloxy, phenylthio, 
phenylsulfinyl, phenylsulfonyl, phenylsulfonyloxy, 
C1-C6 alkylthio, C1-C6 alkylsulfinyl, C1-C6 alkylsulfonyl 
or (C3-C7 cycloalkyl)carbonyl, said phenyl groups, and 
the phenyl portion of said benzoyl group, optionally 
having 1 to 3 substituents each independently selected 
from halo, C1-C4 alkyl, halo(C1-C4 alkyl), C1-C4 alkoxy, 
C1-C4 alkylthio, C1-C4 alkylsulfinyl, C1-C4 alkylsulfonyl, 
C2-C4 alkanoyl, nitro, isothiocyanato, and cyano; or 
(ii) a group of the formula:-  
 
 
where X is O,S,SO,SO2 or NR4 in which R4 is hydrogen; 
C1-C4 alkyl, phenyl or phenyl(C1-C4 alkyl), said phenyl 
groups being optionally substituted by 1 or 2 
substituents each independently selected from C1-C4 
alkyl, halo, hydroxy and C1-C4 alkoxy; and R5 is H, C1-C4 
alkyl, halo, hydroxy or C1-C4 alkoxy; 
 
where R6 is C1-C4 alkyl, 
allyl or phenyl, 
R1 being in the 5(6)-position when R is H, and in the 5- 
or 6-position when R is other than H; and R2 and R3 are each independently -CO2(C1-C4 alkyl). 
Preferred alkyl and alkoxy groups have 1 to 4 
carbon atoms. n is preferably an integer of from 3 to 6. R is preferably H, -CO2(C1-C8 alkyl), 
-CO2(cholester-3-yl), -CO2(CH2)nCOOH or -CO2(CH2)nCO2-(C1-C4alkyl) 
where n is an integer of from 3 to 6. R is most preferably H, -CO2(C1-C4 alkyl). R1 is preferably C1-C4 alkylthio, C1-C4 
alkylsulphinyl, phenylthio, phenylsulfinyl, benzoyl 
optionally substituted by halo, phenylsulfonyloxy 
optionally substituted by halo, or 1,2-benzisoxazol-3-yl. More preferably, R1 is benzoyl, 4-fluorobenzoyl, 4-fluorophenylsulfonyloxy, 
n-propylthio, 
n-propylsulfinyl, phenylthio, phenylsulfinyl, or 1,2-benzisoxazol-3-yl. Most preferably, R1 is n-propylthio; R2 and R3 are preferably the same and are both most 
preferably -CO2CH3. Alkyl, alkoxy, alkanoyl, alkenyl and alkynyl 
groups, when appropriate, can be straight or branched 
chain. "Halo" means F, Cl, Br or I. Suitable non-toxic acid addition salts, suitable 
for veterinary use, are for example
