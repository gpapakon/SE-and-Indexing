Compressed-air actuated disk brake comprising a caliper 

(2)
 which reaches around a brake disk 
(1)
 and on one 
side of which an application device 
(3)
 is arranged 
which has a pivotally mounted pivoting lever 
(4, 4a)
 
which, by means of an eccentric 
(6)
, rests against a 
traverse 
(7)
 which extends in parallel to the axis of 
rotation 
(25)
 and is guided to be displaceable with 
respect to said brake disk 
(1)
 and has at least one 
actuating spindle 
(72, 73)
 comprising an external 
thread 
(711)
 adjustably screwed into it, said actuating 
spindle 
(72, 73)
, by way of at least one pressure 
member 
(70, 71)
 mounted on the end thereof facing the 
brake disk, acting upon a brake pad 
(10)
 which, on the 
application side, is disposed in said caliper 
(2)
 to be 
displaceable with respect to said brake disk 
(1)
,
characterized in that
 
the end face of said actuating spindle 
(72, 73)
 which 
faces said pressure member 
(70, 71)
 is closed and 
comprises a journal 
(713)
 which can be engaged with a 
recess 
(720)
 formed in said pressure member 
(70, 71),
 
and that the end face of said actuating spindle 
(72, 
73)
 facing said pressure member 
(70, 71)
 comprises an 
outer conical annular surface 
(714)
 which can be 
engaged with a corresponding inner conical annular 

surface 
(722)
 of said pressure member 
(70, 71),
 said 
pressure member 
(70, 71)
 being guided to guide said 
brake pad 
(10)
 without tilting exclusively by way of 
said journal 
(713)
 and of said annular surface 
(714).
Compressed-air actuated disk brake according to claim 
1, 
characterized in that
 the angle of inclination of 
said outer conical annular surface 
(714)
 is selected 
such that its plane of projection 
(80)
 directed towards  
 

the outside encompasses essentially all of the outer 
circumference of that area of said pressure member 
(70, 
71)
 which can be made to contact said brake pad 
(10).
Compressed-air actuated disk brake according to claim 1 
or 2, 
characterized in that
 an annular surface 
(715, 
723)
 is provided in parallel to the base between said 
conical annular surfaces 
(715, 722)
 and said journal 

(713)
 or said recess 
(720)
 of said pressure member 
(70, 
71),
 respectively. 
Compressed-air actuated disk brake according to one of 
claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 said pressure 
member 
(70, 71)
 can be clamped to said actuating 
spindle 
(72,
 73) by means of clamping means arranged 
between said journal 
(713)
 and said recess 
(720).
Compressed-air actuated disk brake according to claim 
4, 
characterized in that
 said journal 
(713)
 comprises a 
flaring portion at its end. 
Compressed-air actuated disk brake according to claim 4 
or 5, 
characterized in that
 the clamping effect is 
adjusted such that free rotatability of said pressure 

member 
(70, 71)
 is ensured even in the presence of 
rust. 
Compressed-air actuated disk brake according to one of 
claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that
 said actuating 
spindle 
(72, 73)
 is manufactured by means of an 
extrusion process.
