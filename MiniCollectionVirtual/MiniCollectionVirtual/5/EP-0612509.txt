<ABSTRACT>
A prosthetic socket component (12) for articulating anatomical 
joints includes a shell member (16) for being affixed to a first 

bone of the joint and a liner (20) to be received in a cavity (18) of the 
shell member (16) through an opening (26) in the shell member (16) 

communicating with the cavity (18). The cavity (18) has a longitudinal 
axis that is angularly offset from a longitudinal axis of the 

shell member (16), and the liner (20) is rotatable relative to the shell 
member (16) about the cavity axis to change the size of an angle 

made by a socket opening (60) in the liner (20) with the cavity opening (26). 
A method of implanting a prosthetic socket component (12) includes 

the step of aligning a portion of the liner (20) with one of a 
plurality of portions of the shell member (16) to position the 

socket opening (60) a predetermined angular distance from the cavity 

opening (26). An introducer (72) for the prosthetic socket component (12) 
includes a handle (74) and a head (76) for being received in the cavity 

(18) with a longitudinal axis of the handle (74) aligned with the shell 
member longitudinal axis. A system for implanting a prosthetic 

socket component (12) includes the shell member (16), the introducer (72) and 
the liner (20) with the liner (20) being mounted for rotation relative 

to the shell member (16) to change the magnitude of the socket 
opening angle.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to joint surgery and, more
particularly, to prosthetic socket components having socket
openings that are adjustably positionable relative to ball
components of the joints, introducers for positioning shells
of prosthetic socket components on bones of the joints and
systems for use in joint surgery.Various articulating joints of the body, such as the
joints of the hips, have anatomical ball and socket connections
between bones of the joints providing a wide range of motion.
The hip joint, for instance, includes a socket or acetabulum
in the pelvis and a femoral head or ball at an upper end of the
femur or thigh bone received in the acetabulum. Where natural
articulating joints are congenitally defective or become
degraded due to disease or injury, prosthetic or artificial
ball and socket components are commonly implanted in the body
to replace the natural ball and socket structure of the joints.
In total joint replacement surgery, prosthetic ball and socket
components are both implanted as, for example, in total hip
arthroplasty wherein a femoral stem component having a head or
ball thereon to replace the natural femoral head is affixed to
the femur, and a socket or acetabular component having a shell
and a bearing insert or liner received in a cavity of the shell 
is affixed to the acetabulum with the head or ball of the
femoral component rotatably or movably received in a socket of
the liner to recreate the natural articulation of the hip
joint. In subtotal or partial joint replacement surgery,
natural bone structure of the joint is left intact to cooperate
with an implanted prosthetic component, one example of subtotal
joint replacement surgery being a cup arthroplasty wherein a
prosthetic acetabular or socket component is implanted on the
acetabulum to receive the natural femoral head. It is
extremely important in total or partial joint replacement
surgery and, in particular, total and subtotal hip replacement
surgery, that the ball and socket components be optimally
positioned in accordance with the physiological and anatomical
features of the patient to ensure implant stability, resist
dislocation and subluxation of the joint, enhance range of
motion and avoid loosening or failure of the components.
Accordingly, the liners of prosthetic acetabular components
employed in hip surgery have been designed to protrude beyond
openings to the cavities of the shells to angularly position
the sockets of the liners to provide optimal coverage of the
prosthetic femoral heads by
