<ABSTRACT>
A therapeutic agent for NIDDM comprising a 
cytotoxic cytokine as an effective ingredient and a 

therapeutic agent for NIDDM comprising an inducer of a 
cytotoxic cytokine as an effective ingredient. 
When the therapeucit agent of the present 
invention is used, significant effects are obtained in 

protection and therapy of NIDDM for a short time or a long 
time.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a therapeutic 
agent for Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (NIDDM). Diabetes is mainly classified to two types, i.e. 
Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (IDDM) and NIDDM (ref. 
Kosaka J., "The classification of disease based on the 
concept of Diabetes Mellitus", Nippon Rinsho 1990 extra 
number, Diabetes Mellitus, Nippon Rinsho Press, Osaka 
1990, p.161-168). IDDM is a severe disease which attacks 
mainly the infant with symptoms of polyuria or polyposia 
suddenly. Since a patient with IDDM suffers from an 
absolute deficiency of insulin, he dies due to ketosis 
unless he is added an adequate quantity of insulin. On the other hand, NIDDM is Diabetes showing 
relative slight symptoms, which attacks slowly the 
overweight adult. The number of patient with NIDDM is 
large and it is said that in Japan more than 90 % of 
patients who suffer from Diabetes show NIDDM and the 
number of them is two million. IDDM and NIDDM are different on its cause. It 
was shown by studies using IDDM model animals such as NOD 
mouse or BB rat that Î² -cells in the pancreas which 
produce insulin are selectively killed by autoimmune in 
IDDM (ref. Satoh J., " Diabetes and immunity", Diabetes 
Frontier 1, 9-22 (1990)). Furthermore, it was reported 
that in these animals various immunotherapies related to 
processes of immune responses, such as an introduction of 
a normal gene of class II histocompatibility antigen, an 
enucleation of thymus, a transplant of normal bone marrow, 
an administration of various antibodies against T-cell or 
an administration of non-specific immunosuppressive agent, 
suppress a development of Diabetis, and furthermore, 
applications of their therapies to human IDDM have been 
progressing (ref. Satoh J. et al, " Current status of 
prevention and treatment of diabetic complications", 
Elsevier Science Publishers BV, Amsterdam, 1990, p.  
 
658-661). The present inventors had found that a non-specific 
immune stimulation by an administration of 
immunopotentiator (ref. Toyota T. et al, Diabetes 35, 
496-499 (1988) and Satoh J. et al, Diabetes 37, 1188-1194 
(1988)) or by an administration of lymphotoxin (LT) (ref. 
Satoh J. et al., Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication 
No. 112835/1992 and Seino H. et al, Diabetes (in press)) 
or tumour necrosis factor (TNF) (ref. Satoh J. et al, J. 
Clin. Invest. 84, 1345-1348 (1989), Satoh J. et al, J. 
Immunol. 145, 1395-1399 (1990) and Seino H. et al, Clin. 
Exp. Immunol. 86, 413-418 (1991)) which are cytokines, 
suppressed
