Initial pressure governor for a variable displacement 
pump, in particular of a main pump operating at a high 

initial pressure level of a compression unit for a 
hydraulic driving unit, for example, the driving 

cylinder(s) of a thick matter pump with a pump capacity 
regulator (12), which is controlled by means of a hydraulic 

regulating motor, which is driven by alternative pressurization 
and depressurization of a driving pressure 

chamber (18) for carrying out the regulating movements for 
opposite changes of the displaced volume, whereby for the 

control of the respective pressurization and depressurization 
of the driving pressure chamber (18) a pressure regulated 

valve is designed, which, controlled by the initial 
pressure of the pump or a pressure proportional to it, from 

a minimum pressure determined by a minimum restoring force 
of a restoring element, for example, a spring, releases an 

initial pressure which increases with the control pressure 
coupled into its control chamber (27), with which the driving 

pressure chamber of the regulating motor can be regulated, 
characterized in that the restoring element (32, 71) is 

regulated by a restoring force which corresponds only to a 
small fraction of approximately 1/50 to 1/10 of the maximum 

control force of the pressure regulated valve (28, 61) on 
the valve piston (28, 67), in that the pressure regulated 

valve (21, 61) is provided with a restoring chamber (31, 
66) as a second control chamber by the pressurization of 

which an additional restoring force opposite to the control 
force can be generated, the maximum value of which 

corresponds at least approximately to that of the control 
force, and in that the pressure coupled into the restoring 

chamber (31, 66) is derived by means of a hydraulic 
retarder (36, 34) by the pressure coupled into the control 

chamber (27,64) of the pressure regulated valve (21).  
 
The pressure governor according to claim 1, 
characterized in that as a retarder a throttle (36) and a 

pressure reservoir (34) chargeable by it are designed, at 
the mid connection (38) of which the second control chamber 

(31; 66) of the pressure regulated valve (21, 61) is 
connected. 
The pressure governor according to claim 2, 
characterized in that the throttle (36) is formed as a 

regulating throttle. 
The pressure governor according to one of the 
claims 1 to 3, characterized in that a pressure reducer 

(37) is designed as a pressure limiter which limits the 
initial pressure of the high pressure pump (11) to an 

adjustable value. 
The pressure governor according to one of the 
claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the retarder (36, 34) 

can be switched off. 
The pressure governor according to claim 5 in 
combination with claim 2, characterized in that the 

pressure reservoir (34) can be blocked against the throttle 
(36). 
The pressure governor according to claim 6, 
characterized in that a retarding control valve (41) 

designed for blocking the pressure reservoir (34) is formed 
as a 3/2-way valve, in the original position of which the 

pressure reservoir (34) is connected with the pressure 
reservoir (34) against the throttle (36), but connected to 

the store tank (23) of the compression unit (10; 10'; 10'').  
 
The pressure governor according to one of the 
claims 5 to 7, characterized in that between the high 

pressure outlet (24) of the variable displacement pump (11) 
and the retarder (36, 34) a valve (74; 84; 84') is 

connected, which has an original position (0), in which the 
high pressure outlet (24) of the variable displacement pump 

(11) is connected to the retarder (36, 34) and a regulating 
position (I), in which the high pressure outlet of the 

variable displacement pump (11) is blocked against the 
retarder, but directly connected with the second control 

chamber (31; 66) of the pressure regulated valve (21, 61). 
The pressure governor according to claim 8, 
characterized in that the high pressure outlet (24) of the 

variable displacement pump (11) is connected between the 
control line (39) to the switching position (I) of the 

functional control valve (74; 84; 84'), and a check valve 
(81) is connected to the pressure reservoir (34) of the 

retarder (36, 34), which is regulated in blocking direction 
by a relatively higher pressure in the control line (39) 

than in the pressure reservoir (34). 
The pressure governor according to one of the 
claims 5 to 9, characterized in that between the second 

control chamber (31; 66) of the pressure regulated valve 
(21, 61) and the tapping position (38; 38; 81) of the 

retarder (36, 34) at which the pressure which can be 
coupled into the second control chamber (31) of the pressure 

regulating valve (21) can be tapped, a valve (82; 84; 
84') is connected which can be switched from an original 

position (0) in which the tapping position (38, 38; 81) is 
connected with the control chamber (31; 66) in which the 

second control chamber (31; 66) is blocked against the 
tapping position (38), but connected with the depressurized 

store tank (23) of the compression unit (10; 10').

of the valve spring (32, 71) of the pressure regulated 
valve (21, 61) is controllable.
