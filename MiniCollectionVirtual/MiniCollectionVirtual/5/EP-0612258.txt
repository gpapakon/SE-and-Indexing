<ABSTRACT>
A transdermal device for the controlled administration of a drug to the skin comprises a reservoir (12) for the drug and an electric circuit which includes an electrode system (13, 14) which is operable to actively transport the drug in a controlled manner from the reservoir (12) towards the skin for transport therethrough, the skin not being part of the electric circuit, and the drug passing through an electrode (13) of said electrode system (13, 14) during the active transport to the skin. The electrode (13) is disposed between the reservoir (12) for the drug and an optional transit chamber (15). The electrode (13) can be permeable to the drug or the electrode can function as a gate, being permeable to the drug in the open condition and less permeable to the drug in the closed condition. The operation of the gate can be determined by the composition or the structure of the electrode (13). The device achieves drug delivery rates comparable to those achieved with iontophoretic devices.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a transdermal device for the 
administration of drugs to the skin and, more particularly, to a device 
for the systemic delivery of drugs by the transdermal route involving 
uptake of a given drug by the skin. The administration of drugs percutaneously or transdermally has 
a number of advantages and is favoured in the case where drugs are not 
effectively administered by the oral route but where systemic 
administration is required. This is especially true for drugs which are 
subject to a first-pass hepatic metabolism or which are susceptible to 
deactivation by digestive enzymes. There are also a number of problems associated with the 
administration of drugs by the transdermal route, for example, a rate 
of uptake of drug which is therapeutically effective may not be 
achievable. The use of penetration enhancers, for example, 
dimethylsulphoxide, N,N-dimethylformamide and others is employed 
to promote uptake. However, such penetration enhancers are not always 
effective or sufficient to achieve adequate percutaneous absorption. Also the manufacture of stable transdermal devices can be a 
problem because it may not be possible to find a carrier medium which 
can maintain the drug in a stable condition until use and from which the 
drug can be successfully transported to and into the skin following 
application of the transdermal device at the site of administration. For some drugs such as glyceryl trinitrate fluctuations in blood 
level rather than a continuous constant level is required. Thus there is a  
 
need for devices or systems capable of periodic or pulsed drug 
delivery. For drugs that are not amenable to passive administration by the 
percutaneous route or for drugs that are effectively percutaneously 
absorbed as charged molecules, iontophoretic drug delivery is gaining 
increasing popularity. However, iontophoretic drug delivery also has a number of 
problems, not least of which is the trauma caused by bums and pain 
which may be associated with the use of this type of delivery which 
involves migration of drug molecules in the shin under the influence of 
an electric field. Hence conventional iontophoresis as a means of drug 
delivery may not achieve good patient compliance. One solution for dealing with the problems associated with 
iontophoresis is the electrode device of U.S. Patent No. 4,722,726, one 
of the stated objects of which is to provide an iontophoretic drug 
delivery device that inhibits the current carrying capacity of ions in the 
carrier
