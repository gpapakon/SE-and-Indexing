<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns sheeting or a moulding made of multi-phase plastic containing an elastomer-modified thermoplast, a modifier and other usually used additives, the elastomer-modified thermoplast being an acrylonitrile/styrene/acrylate (ASA) copolymer with an acrylate content of about 25 to 80 % by wt. and the required hardness or softness of the ASA being controlled by incorporation of a modifier, (1) in the case of a hard ASA, an external softening agent, in the form of (a) a monomeric or oligomeric softener as usually used to soften PVC and/or (b) an amorphous or partly crystalline polymeric softener with a maximum degree of crystallinity of about 25 %, being incorporated in the ASA to soften it, the ratio by weight of hard elastomer-modified ASA to external softener being about 9:1 to 1:1, and (2) in the case of a soft ASA, a polymer sufficiently compatible with ASA and with an E-modulus of  
>
/=  2000 N/mm
<
2
>
 is incorporated in the ASA to increase its hardness, the ratio of ASA to hardener being about 20:1 to 1:1. Sheeting of this kind is particularly suitable for use in the form of composite sheeting for interior coverings in vehicles.
