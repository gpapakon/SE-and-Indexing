<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to the field of disk 
drives, which are also called direct access storage 
devices (DASD). Specifically, this invention pertains 
to an apparatus for stabilizing the flying height and 
roll of a slider of the type described in 
EP-A-0 432 733. Computer systems employ a number of storage means to 
store data. One of these storage means is a disk 
drive, which is also called a direct access storage 
device (DASD). A disk drive includes several disks 
that look similar to 45 RPM records used on a record 
player or compact disks used in a CD player. The disks 
are stacked on a spindle, much like several 45 RPM 
records awaiting to be played. In a disk drive, 
however, the disks are mounted on the spindle and 
spaced apart so that the separate disks do not touch 
each other. The surface of each disk is uniform in appearance. 
Nevertheless, in actuality, each of the surfaces is 
divided into portions, called tracks, where data is 
stored. These tracks are arranged in concentric 
circles like rings in a tree. Compact disks have 
tracks as do the disks in a disk drive. The tracks in 
either the disk drive or the compact disk essentially 
replace the grooves in a 45 RPM record. Each track in  
 
a disk drive is further subdivided into sectors, which 
are just sections of one of the concentric tracks. Disks are made of a variety of materials, such as 
metal, plastic, or glass. In a plastic disk, such as 
those used as CD's, a laser stores and retrieves the 
data. In a metal disk, an electrical magnet, commonly 
known as a transducer, stores and retrieves the data. In order to store data on a magnetic disk, the disk 
surface is magnetized using a small ceramic block, 
commonly called a slider, that contains a magnetic 
transducer, called a write head. More specifically, 
the slider containing the write head is flown at a 
height of a few millionths of an inch from the disk 
surface, and the head is energized to various states 
causing the track below to be magnetized to represent 
the data. To retrieve data stored on a magnetic disk, the slider 
containing a read head is flown over the disk. This 
time the magnetized portions of the track induce a 
current in the read head. By analyzing the current 
output from the read head, the computer system can 
reconstruct and use the data stored on the magnetic 
disk. Although some disk drives use a separate read 
and write head, most current disk drives use a 
transducer that acts as both the read and write head. Like a record, both sides of
