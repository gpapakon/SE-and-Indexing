<ABSTRACT>
Phosphonate esters can be synthesized in high yields by condensations of alcohols with methyl phosphonates followed by selective demethylation. The reaction is general, relatively insensitive to steric constraints of hindered phosphonic acids, and can also be carried out on a solid support to synthesize large collections of compounds to screen for pharmacological activity.

<DESCRIPTION>
METHODS FOR THE SYNTHESIS OF PHOSFHONATE ESTERSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates generally to methods for the synthesis of phosphonate esters. More particularly, the invention provides methods for producing monoesters and diesters of phosphonic acids from condensations of alcohols with alkylphosphonates, such as methyl α-aminoalkyl- phosphonates. The methods can be carried out in solution phase, but in an important embodiment, the method is carried out on a solid support, such as beads or a glass slide, and used to create large arrays of diverse compounds, such as peptidylphosphonates and polyphosphonates, which can then be conveniently screened for the presence of compounds with desired pharmacological or other properties. The invention therefore relates to the fields of chemistry, enzymology, pharmacology, and medicinal chemistry.Aminophosphonic acids and aminophosphonates are derivatives of amino acids in which the amino acid carboxyl group has been replaced with a phosphonic acid or phosphonate moiety. In α- aminophosphonic acids and phosphonates, the α-carbon is often a chiral center, bearing a phosphonate moiety, an amine moiety, and one or more amino acid side chains. The structure can be represented as follows:
 (PO)(OR')(OR") 

wherein R represents any amino acid side chain and R' and R" represent hydrogen (in the case of a phosphonic acid) or a group such as alkyl or aryl (in the case of a phosphonate ester). α-Aminophosphonates are used in the synthesis of peptide analogues (peptidylphosphonates) possessing a phosphonate linkage in the place of at least one amide link in the peptide main chain. The phosphonate linkage can impart various useful properties to peptides. Because the phosphonate linkage in a peptidylphosphonate exists as a charged moiety in the peptide backbone, it increases the water solubility of the peptide. Further, the phosphonate linkage can impart protease resistance and thereby increase the serum half-life of many therapeutic peptide. Still further, substitution of the phosphonate linkage for the amide linkage allows additional functionalities to be introduced in otherwise inaccessible regions of naturally occurring peptides. This is because the phosphonate linkages are tetrahedral, while amide linkages are planar. The tetrahedral geometry allows substituents to be placed above and below the plane of the amide linkage of a peptide. Moreover, the tetrahedral configuration of the phosphonate linkage can be exploited to optimize ligand-receptor binding. See
