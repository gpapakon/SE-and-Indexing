<ABSTRACT>
Metal patterns (11, 11', 11'') can be provided on a glass substrate (1) in 
an electroless process by modifying the substrate with a silane monolayer (3), nucleating 

said momolayer with a polymer-stabilized Pd sol (5) and, subsequently, locally 
removing the Pd nuclei and silane layer (9, 9') with a pulsed laser. Neither a 

photoresist nor organic solvents are used. The method can very suitably be used for the 
manufacture of the black matrix on a faceplate of display devices, such as the passive 

plate for an LCD.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of providing a metal pattern on a 
electrically insulating substrate in an electroless process, in which method the substrate 
is pretreated and subsequently locally exposed to light, whereafter the substrate is 
brought into contact with a aqueous metal-salt solution, thereby forming the metal 
pattern on the unexposed areas. The invention relates, in particular, to a method of manufacturing a black 
matrix of metal on a glass faceplate of a display device, such as a colour display tube 
and a liquid-crystal display device. Electroless or chemical metallization is a simple and inexpensive method 
of metallizing dielectric substrates such as glass, ceramics and polymer synthetic resins. 
For this purpose, electroless metallization baths, such as copper and nickel baths, are 
used which comprise complexed metal ions and a reducing agent. On catalytic surfaces 
the metal ions are reduced to metal. In general, metallic Pd nuclei are provided on the 
surface to be metallized in order to render said surface catalytic. In a standard 
procedure the substrate to be metallized is nucleated (termed activation) beforehand by 
bringing the substrate into contact with either aqueous solutions of, in succession, SnCl2 
and PdCl2 or with a colloidal SnPd dispersion. In either case, the Pd nuclei are 
surrounded by adsorbed Sn4+ ions, thereby forming a charge-stabilized Pd sol. The 
activated surface is subsequently immersed in an electroless metallization bath, causing 
the surface to be metallized. Said activation methods are non-selective, i.e. the entire 
substrate surface, such as glass, is nucleated and hence metallized. These activation 
methods can suitably be used for electroless copper, the strongly reducing formaldehyde 
being used as the reducing agent. However, for most electroless nickel baths said 
activation methods are less suitable due to the reduced reactivity of the reducing agents 
used, for example hypophosphite, in these baths and due to the lower pH value. This is 
caused by the use of Sn2+ ions in the preparation of the Pd sol, which leads to the 
formation of Sn4+ ions. The Sn4+ ions adsorbed on the Pd particles, which ions are 
used as stabilizers in electroless nickel baths, inhibit the oxidation of the reducing agent.  
 
To bring about nickel deposition use must be made of very reactive nickel baths without 
stabilizers, such as a superalkaline electroless nickel bath on the basis of hypophosphite 
(pH > 14). However, the absence of stabilizers in an
