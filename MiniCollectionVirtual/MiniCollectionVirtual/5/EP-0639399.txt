<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is a process for the 
treatment of a by-product gaseous mixture resulting from the 

reaction of methyl chloride with silicon to form 
methylchlorosilanes. The process employs pressure swing 

adsorption to separate the by-product gases into a gaseous 
mixture enriched in methyl chloride and a gas reduced in 

methyl chloride content. The gaseous mixture enriched in 
methyl chloride content can be thermally oxidized. The gas 

reduced in methyl chloride content can be used as a fuel 
source or used as a feed to another process. By separating 

the methyl chloride from other combustible gases, it is 
possible to thermally oxidize greater quantities of methyl 

chloride, per unit time, for a given size thermal oxidizer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is a process for the
treatment of a by-product gaseous mixture resulting from the
reaction of methyl chloride with silicon to form
methylchlorosilanes. The process employs pressure swing
adsorption to separate the by-product gases into a gaseous
mixture enriched in methyl chloride content and a gas
reduced in methyl chloride content. The gaseous mixture
enriched in methyl chloride content is thermally
oxidized. The gaseous mixture reduced in methyl chloride
content can be used as a fuel source or used as a feed to
another process. An advantage of the present process is
that, by separating the methyl chloride from other
combustible gases, it is possible to thermally oxidize
greater quantities of methyl chloride, per unit time, for a
given size thermal oxidizer.The direct process for the production of methylchlorosilanes,
as first described by Rochow, US-A 2,380,995
involves the reaction of methyl chloride with silicon in the
presence of a suitable catalyst. A typical by-product of
this process is a gaseous mixture comprising methyl
chloride, methane, hydrogen, nitrogen and residual
chlorosilanes. Federal and State environmental regulations
require that by-product gases from chemical processes be
controlled using environmentally sound methods. Typically,
gases such as methane, hydrogen and nitrogen can be vented
into the atmosphere without further treatment. However,
chlorinated hydrocarbons, such as methyl chloride, are not 
considered environmentally safe and cannot be freely vented
to the atmosphere.Thermal oxidation of the by-product gaseous
mixture from the direct process is considered an
environmentallysound method for disposing of methyl chloride
and other gases. However, in practice, the methyl chloride
may only comprise a minor component of the total combustible
content of the by-product gaseous mixture. The capacity of
a thermal oxidizer to thermally oxidize by-product gases is
limited by the thermal load the thermal oxidizer is designed
to handle. Therefore, by separating the methyl chloride
from other combustible gases, it is possible to thermally
oxidize greater quantities of methyl chloride, per unit
time, for a given size thermal oxidizer.It is known that organic vapors can be recovered
by passing the gas stream through an adsorbent bed
containing a substance, such as activated carbon, to adsorb
the vapors. It is also known to desorb the organic vapor
from the bed by maintaining a steady temperature in the bed
and lowering pressure within the bed. Known systems are

with an adsorbent capable of reversibly

adsorbing the methyl chloride, to provide a gas reduced in
