<ABSTRACT>
A user interface technique operates in the environment of a processor-controlled 
machine for executing a program that operates on a set of underlying data and displays a 

visible representation (50,52) thereof. The system generates a visual depiction of a movable 
sheet (60) having a number of delineated regions (active areas), responds to a first set of 

signals for positioning the sheet relative to the visible representation, responds to a second set 
of signals characterized by position information (typically cursor (55) position) relative to the 

sheet and the visible representation, and generates a third set of signals to the program. The 
third set of signals depends on the relative position of the sheet and the visible representation 

and on the position information that characterizes the second set of input signals. The 
delineated regions may be thought of and referred to as clickthrough tools.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to processor controlled machines such as
computers and more specifically to user interfaces for allowing a user to interact with the
machine.A frequent use of a processor-controlled machine such as a computer is to
communicate information to a user of the machine and accept information from the user,
thereby allowing the user to perform a specified task. Depending on the task at hand, the user
will often make use of a task-specific application program such as a word processor (sometimes
referred to as a text editor), a spreadsheet, a database, or a drawing program (sometimes
referred to as a graphics editor). A reference to a specific type of program or editor is not
intended to imply a stand-alone application program having only the particular functionality,
since many programs have more than one type of functionality.A typical application program consists of a set of instructions (the "application")
that are executed in response to input signals to create and modify associated data (sometimes
referred to as the underlying data). In many instances, this associated data is stored on a disk as
a data file (sometimes referred to as "the file"), and portions are read into memory during
program execution. For at least some applications, the data represents a document that is to
be viewed (e.g., printed or displayed on a screen), and the application allows a user to modify
the document.In many instances, a user provides at least some of the input signals through one or
more input devices, often a keyboard and a pointing device such as a mouse. By way of
background, a mouse is a device that is moved over a work surface, typically next to the
keyboard, and provides position signals so as to cause a cursor on the screen to move in
accordance with the mouse's movements The cursor is a special symbol that is used by an
interactive program as a pointer or attention-focusing device. The mouse contains one or more
pushbutton switches ("buttons") to provide additional input signals, which may be interpreted
as part of a cursor event.A display device, typically a visual display device such as a cathode ray tube (CRT) or
a liquid crystal display (LCD), provides the user with information about the application and the
underlying data, and allows the user to generate appropriate input signals and thus control the
operation of the machine to produce the intended work product. The combination of input
devices, display devices, and the nature of the information that the application

<CLAIMS>
A method of providing interactivity between a computer system (10) and a
user, the method comprising:


displaying a representation (50, 52) of data on a display (22);
displaying, on said display (22), an object (60) that represents a tool
having an associated executable operation;
in response to a first user interaction, positioning said tool relative to the
displayed data (50, 52) so that said tool overlaps a desired particular

portion of the displayed data (50, 52);
in response to a second user interaction, generating a particular event in
a region within said tool, which region specifies the desired particular

portion of the displayed data (50, 52); and
in response to said particular event, causing execution of the operation
associated with said tool on the desired particular portion of the displayed

data (50, 52).
The method of claim 1 wherein said displayed data (50, 52) includes a
graphical object or a passage of text.
The method of claim 1 or 2 wherein said second user interaction occurs in
conjunction with displaying a cursor (55) at the location of the particular

event.
The method of one of claims 1 to 3 wherein the operation associated with
said tool augments the data, removes a portion of the data, modifies a

portion of the data or extracts a portion of the data. 
The method of one of claims 1 to 4 wherein the second user interaction
results from the user performing a gesture with a user-actuated device (27,

30), such that the gesture has a distinguished feature point and a sequence
of points.
The method of claim 5 wherein the gesture commences within said tool.
The method of one of claims 1 to 6 wherein said tool is one of a plurality of
tools, other tools of which have other associated executable operations.
The method of claim 7 wherein said tools are displayed as on a transparent
overlay (60) having a plurality of delineated regions.
A computer system (10) providing interactivity with a user, the computer
system comprising:


means (22) for displaying a representation of data;
means (22) for displaying an object (60) that represents a tool having an
associated executable operation;
means (30) for generating first signals in response to a first user
interaction;
means (27) for generating second signals in response to a second user
interaction;
means (12), responsive to said first signals, for positioning said tool
relative to the displayed data (50, 52) so that said tool overlaps a desired

particular portion of the displayed data (50, 52);
means (12), responsive to said second signals, for generating a particular
event in a region within said tool, which region specifies the desired

particular portion of the displayed data (50, 52); and
means (12), responsive to said particular event, for causing execution of
the operation associated with said tool on the desired particular portion of

the displayed data (50, 52).
