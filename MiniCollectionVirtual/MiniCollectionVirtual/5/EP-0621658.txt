<ABSTRACT>
A lock connector with high reliability comprises a short 
circuit electrode for normally biasing a flexible lock piece 

in the upward direction is disposed on the upper surface of a 
connector housing on the female side, while a pair of lock 

detecting electrodes and are held at the positions where they 
are held in a connector housing on the male side by the 

elastic restoring action of the flexible lock piece. Thus, a 
restoring operation of the flexible piece and short-circuiting 

between the opponent terminals can simultaneously 
be achieved without any deviation from the correct timing 

relationship established among the aforementioned components.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a lock connector which
can reliably detect that a pair of connector housings are
electrically connected to each other by way of short-circuiting
in the locked state.A known lock connector of the foregoing type, as disclosed in US-A-4 900 267, is shown in
disassembled state in Fig. 11 of the drawings attached hereto. Referring to the drawing,
a male connector housing 1 is fixedly mounted on a base plate
2 and includes a pair of lock detecting electrodes 4a and 4b
on the opposite side parts of a positioning piece 3 having an
inverted T-shaped cross-sectional contour as shown in Fig.
12. On the other hand, as shown in the drawing, a female
connector housing 5 includes a substantially U-shaped short
circuit electrode 6 of which one end is projected to come in
contact with the opposite side parts of the positioning piece
3 and of which other end is connected to a main body of the
female connector housing 5. Incidentally, to assure that the
short circuit electrode 6 is not brought in contact with the
lock detecting electrodes 4a and 4b by curvedly bending the
short circuit electrode 6 in the upward direction at the
beginning time when the short circuit electrode 6 is fitted
into the connector housing 1 on the male side, a pair of
guide projections 3b are formed on the opposite sides of an 
upright standing partition wall portion 3a of the positioning
piece 3.On the other hand, a flexible lock piece 7 is formed
integral with the female connector housing 5 on the upper
surface of the latter, and a protuberance 7a is formed on the
upper surface of the flexible lock piece 7. In addition, an
engagement hole 1a adapted to be engaged with the
protuberance 7a of the flexible lock piece 7 is formed on the
upper surface of the male connector housing 1.With such construction, as the flexible lock piece 7 on
the female connector housing 5 is inserted into the male
connector housing 1 while it is curvedly bent, the short
circuit electrode 6 is curvedly bent in the slantwise upward
direction by the guide projections 3b as shown in Fig. 13.
When the female connector housing 5 is completely inserted in
the male connector housing 1, the protuberance 7a of the
flexible lock piece 7 is engaged with the engagement hole 1a
of the male connector housing 1, and at the same time, the
short circuit electrode 6 is parted away from the guide
projections 3b and comes in contact with the lock detecting
electrodes 4a and 4b as shown in Fig. 14. The lock detecting
electrodes 4a and 4b are electrically

coupleable with said first connector housing and

having an engagment portion (32; 51) formed thereon
to be engaged with said flexible lock piece (13;

42); and
detecting means for detecting the locked state
between both connector housings, said detecting

means comprising:

      a pair of lock detecting electrodes (33a, 33b,
52, 52b) disposed on said second connector

detecting electrodes (33a, 33b; 52a, 52b),

characterized in that said pair of short circuit electrode
portions (14a) is disposed on a surface of said flexible

lock piece (13; 42) in such manner that restoring of the
flexible lock piece (13; 42) in the locked state

establishes electrical connection between said short
circuit electrode (14; 42) and said pair of lock detecting

electrodes (33a, 33b; 52a, 52b). 
A lock connector as claimed in claim 1, characterized
in that said first connector housing (10) includes a metal

leaf spring (14b) between said flexible lock piece (13) and
said first connector housing, and said pair of short

circuit electrode portions (14a) is urged by said leaf
spring. 
A lock connector as claimed in claim 2, characterized
in that said metal leaf spring (14b) is integer with said

short circuit electrode portions (14a).
A lock connector as claimed in claim 1, wherein said
second connector housing (30) includes a partition wall

(32) extending toward the flexible lock piece (13) of said
first connector housing so that said pair of lock detecting

electrodes (33a, 33b) is disposed with said partition wall
(32) interposed between said lock detecting electrodes, and

said first connector housing (10) includes an engagement
hole (13b) for receiving a part of said partition wall (32)

in engagement with said engagement hole at the position
located opposite to said partition wall while said flexible

lock piece (13) is correctly brought in contact with said
engagement portion.
A lock connector as claimed in claim 1, characterized
in that said flexible lock piece (42) is made of metal and

forms said short circuit electrode (figure 7 and 8).
