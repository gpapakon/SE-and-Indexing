<ABSTRACT>
A security enhancement for laptop computers comprises the use of 
a moving visible area and an obscured area for the laptop screen. 

The visible area may be defined by the user to comprise a single 
word, a single line, or a plurality of lines of data. The 

obscured area may comprise all remaining space on the laptop 
screen not defined as the visible area. A user may specify that 

the obscured area be completely hidden from view (i.e., such as 
by blackening or whiting out the area) or difficult to view by 

others. The present invention is particularly useful with a 
laptop computer in a crowded environment such as while travelling 

on an airplane. The present invention will reduce the likelihood 
of unauthorized viewing of possibly sensitive computer data by 

others.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to software, and in particular 
to a method and apparatus for preventing the unwanted viewing of 
computer data by persons other than the current user. With the proliferation of portable computer equipment, there has 
been a tremendous increase in the number of office workers who 
are able to take their computerized "office" with them on 
extended business trips. This capability has positive affects on 
the productivity of workers and thus their company/corporation. 
Workers have the ability to transform millions of hours that were 
formally wasted away during travelling into productive use. 
Additionally, in many cases, the office worker may be in continuous 
contact with the home office which can significantly 
enhance the quality of decision making. While travelling, the portable computer user often runs the 
risk of unintentional and/or intentional examination of any 
information that is actively being manipulated. The potential of 
exposing what may be valuable company/corporate information to 
others can be very risky. To avoid such observation, users must 
typically resort to awkward and impolite techniques, such as, for 
example, a shade or hood which partially covers the viewing 
screen. A hood can be cumbersome and awkward to use and, therefore, 
may be counter-productive. Since it may be critical to 
avoid the unwanted dissemination of company/corporate 
information, there is a need for a method and apparatus which 
will allow a user to work on a portable computer while minimizing  
 
unintentional encroachment even when in the presence of many 
others. The present invention provides a method and apparatus for 
reducing the likelihood of unauthorized viewing of computer data 
which substantially reduces or eliminates the problems associated 
with prior art devices. The present invention allows a user to 
work with a portable computer in a crowded environment with 
reduced fear of exposing valuable information to others. In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, a method 
of reducing a likelihood of unauthorized observation of on-screen 
computer data is provided. The computer screen work area is 
divided into a visible area and an obscured area. The visible 
area allows the user to clearly see and work with data. The 
obscured area comprises the remaining screen area and makes it 
difficult or impossible to view data. The obscured area may be completely blackened, completely whited 
out, greyed, over-written, blurred, etc. The visible area may

<CLAIMS>
A method of reducing a likelihood of unauthorized 
observation of on-screen computer data, comprising the steps 

of: 
forming a predefined moving visible area on a computer 

screen in which data is clearly visible to a user; and 
forming an obscured area comprising said computer screen 

other than said visible area. 
The method of Claim 1, wherein said step of forming a 
visible area comprises: 

forming a visible area comprising only a single currently 
used data string. 
The method of Claim 1, wherein said step of forming a 
visible area comprises: 

forming a visible area comprising at least a currently used 
line of data. 
The method of Claims 1, 2 or 3 wherein said step of forming 
an obscured area comprises: 

forming a greyed area or a blackened area. 
The method of Claims 1, 2 or 3 wherein said step of forming 
an obscured area comprises: 

forming a whited out area, or an overwritten area. 
A computer system for reducing a likelihood of unauthorized 
observation of on-screen data, comprising the steps of:

 
means for forming a predetermined moving visible area on a 

computer screen in which data is clearly visible; and 
means for forming an obscured area comprising said computer 

screen other than said visible area. 
The computer system of Claim 6, wherein said means for 
forming a visible area comprises: 

means for forming a visible area comprising only a single 
currently used data string. 
The computer system of Claim 6, wherein said means for 
forming a visible area comprises: 

means for forming a visible area comprising at least a 
currently used line of data. 
The computer system of Claims 6, 7 or 8, wherein said means 
for forming an obscured area comprises: 

means for forming a greyed area, or a blackened area. 
The computer system of Claims 6, 7 or 8, wherein said means 
for forming an obscured area comprises: 

means for forming a whited out area, or an overwritten area.
