<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polyamide having
markedly excellent moldability and having excellent hot
water resistance, surface appearance, heat resistance,
mechanical characteristics and chemical resistance, as well
as low water absorption. The present invention also relates
to polyamide compositions comprising the above polyamides
and a filler and being suitable for engineering plastics.Crystalline polyamides as represented by nylon 6 and
nylon 66 have been widely used for fibers for clothing and
industrial uses and as general-purpose engineering plastics.
However, they have the drawbacks of poor heat resistance
and poor dimensional stability as caused by water
absorption. In particular, it has become difficult to use
conventional polyamides in the fields of those electric and
electronic parts requiring good flow-solder resistance as
accompanied by development of surface mounting techniques in
recent years or of car engine room parts requiring better
heat resistance year by year. There has been therefore an
increasing demand for development of a polyamide having
better resistance, dimensional stability, mechanical
characteristics and physical and chemical characteristics. To meet the above requirements, aliphatic polyamides
comprising adipic acid and 1,4-butanediamine and aromatic
polyamides comprising terephthalic acid and 1,6-hexanediamine
as main components (hereinafter referred to as 6-T
polyamides) have been proposed and partly put into practical
uses. However, aliphatic polyamides comprising adipic acid
and 1,4-butanediamine, having low melt viscosity and hence
having good moldability, have the problem of high water
absorption which causes their properties such as dimensional
stability to fluctuate during use. Aromatic polyamides
comprising terephthalic acid and 1,6-hexanediamine have a
melting point near 370°C, which exceeds the decomposition
point of the polymer and hence cannot be melt molded. The
aromatic polyamides are therefore currently used after
modification to decrease their melting point to about 280-320°C
by copolymerizing 30-40 mole % of a dicarboxylic acid
component such as adipic acid or isophthalic acid or an aliphatic
polyamide such as nylon 6. However, copolymerization
of such a large amount of a third component (in some cases,
further a fourth component), which is surely effective in
decreasing the melting point, decreases the rate of
crystallization and the attainable degree of crystallization,
thereby deteriorating the properties such as rigidity
under high
