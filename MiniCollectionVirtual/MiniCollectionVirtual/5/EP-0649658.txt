<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides methods for increasing the 
cytotoxicity of a chemotherapy agent towards a solid tumor, such 

tumor susceptible to treatment with the chemotherapy agent, 
comprising administering to a mammal having such a tumor, from 

about one half hour to about twenty-four hours prior to 
administering the chemotherapy agent, or from about one hour to 

about two hours after administering the chemotherapy agent, a 

cytotoxicity-enhancing amount of a compound of Formula I. The 
invention also provides kits for treatment of such tumors which 

comprise a chemotherapy agent and a cytotoxicity-enhancing 
amount of a 1,2,4-benzotriazine oxide as defined in Formula I. 
The present invention also provides the use of a compound of 
Formula I capable of exerting a cytotoxic-enhancing effect on a 

cancer tumor for the manufacture of a medicament, for the 
therapeutic administration to a mammal having such a tumour from 

about one half hour to about twenty-four hours prior to treatment 
of said tumor with a chemotherapy agent.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of treatments for
cancer tumors. More particularly the present invention relates to
treatment of cancer tumors with combinations of chemotherapy
agents and 1,2,4-benzotriazine oxides.The most commonly used anticancer drugs are more cytotoxic
toward normally oxygenated tumor cells than toward hypoxic tumor
cells. Hypoxic cell resistance to irradiation is also widely known.
Consequently, tumor hypoxia and the resultant resistance to
treatment is of concern in cancer therapeutics.Solid cancer tumors contain both adequately oxygenated cells
as well as varying proportions of inadequately oxygenated or
hypoxic cells. Hypoxia usually occurs where the tumor cells are
furthest away from blood vessels. Such cells also tend to have
slower rates of proliferation. Although not completely understood,
resistance of hypoxic cells to anticancer drugs is generally thought
to be due to inadequate uptake of the drug by the hypoxic cells
either because they tend to be slowly growing or because of their
distance from the blood vessels bringing the drug. Thus, the
relative proportion of hypoxic cells in the tumor can be of great
importance to the outcome of the treatment. Resistant hypoxic cells
that survive irradiation or drug treatment may become reoxygenated,
thereby restoring tumor sensitivity to further
treatment. Nonetheless, instead of relying on uncertain events, it is
desirable to develop cancer treatments wherein cancer tumor cells,
including hypoxic tumor cells, are killed or rendered inactive more
reliably at the time the treatment is administered.U.S. Patent 5,175,287 discloses the use of 1,2,4-benzotriazine
oxides in conjunction with radiation for treatment of tumors. The
1,2,4-benzotriazine oxides sensitize the tumor cells to radiation and
make them more amenable to this treatment modality. Holden et al (1992) "Enhancement of Alkylating Agent
Activity by SR-4233 in the FSaIIC Murine Fibrosarcoma" JNCI 84:
187-193 discloses the use of SR-4233, also known as tirapazamine,
in combination with an antitumor alkylating agent. The four
antitumor alkylating agents, cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, carmustine
and melphalan, were each tested to examine the ability of
tirapazamine to overcome the resistance of hypoxic tumor cells to
antitumor alkylating agents. Tirapazamine was tested alone and in
combination with varying amounts of each of the antitumor
alkylating agents. When tirapazamine was administered just before
single-dose treatment with cyclophosphamide, carmustine or
melphal
