<ABSTRACT>
A printing apparatus (20) employs a rotatable cam having an 
enclosed cam slot for controlling the rocking motion of an 

inking roll (41) without the need for a cam follower 
spring. The apparatus also includes an articulated printing 

member support assembly which executes a complex curvilinear 
movement under the control of a fixed cam slot without 

the use of linear bearings. Complementary cam profiles are 
used on both cam surfaces in order to maintain tangency 

between the inking roll (41) and printing element (32) 
during inking. A yieldable connecting link is used to 

prevent excessive printing pressures from being applied, 
and a movable filler plate (60) closes off a slot (56) in a 

front cover (50) of the printing apparatus (20) through 
which a portion (59) of the movable printing member (32) 

protrudes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to printing or 
marking apparatus, and is particularly concerned with a 
printing apparatus in which a reciprocating member carries 
a printing element that is inked by means of a rockably 
mounted inking roll. Various types of printing or coding devices have been 
developed for printing variable information on products, 
product containers, or continuous webs of product wrapping 
material. Generally, these devices are designed for 
installation on existing product or web conveyor systems, 
container filling systems, and similar systems, and are 
used to print date codes, lot or batch numbers, or other 
types of information. The simplest type of product coding 
device is a rotary printer, in which a rotary die roll or 
type holder carries a printing element that is brought into 
rolling contact with the article or web surface to be 
printed. These devices require that the product or web be 
kept in motion, either continuously or during the time that 
the printing element is in contact with the surface to be 
printed. Inking of the printing element is usually carried 
out by mounting a rotatable inking roll in a fixed position 
next to the rotatable die roll or type holder. In situations where an intermittently moving conveyor 
is used to transport the articles or web to be printed, as 
in the case where a container filling or sealing operation 
requires periodic stopping of the conveyor, it may be more 
convenient to use a reciprocating or stamping printer 
rather than a rotary printer. The temporary stopping of 
the conveyor provides an interval during which printing can 
be carried out by a reciprocating printing member, and 
inking of the printing element can occur before, during or  
 
after the printing operation by means of an inking roll or 
other type of inking device. The inking of the printing element in a reciprocating 
printer is somewhat more difficult than in the case of a 
rotary printer, particularly when an inking roll is used as 
the inking device. In a rotary printer, the inking roll 
can be mounted with its axis in a fixed position with 
respect to the axis of the rotating printing member, and 
this will suffice to apply ink to the printing element by 
rolling contact once during each printing cycle. In a 
reciprocating printer, however, it is generally not 
possible to mount the inking roll in a fixed position 
relative to the path of the printing member, since this 
will cause ink to be applied to the printing elements twice 
during each
