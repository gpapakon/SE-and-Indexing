<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to flat cable and in particular flat cable 
comprising a plurality of conductors and a substrate comprising a 
polymeric material. Flat cables are well known and take several forms. In one 
form of flat cable a plurality of conductors are placed parallel to one 
another and laminated between a pair of films which surround each 
conductor thereby insulating each conductor from its neighbors as 
well as forming the flat cable construction. The insulation 
thickness of each individual conductor cannot always be controlled 
as precisely and reproducibly as desired. Another form of flat cable, in which pre-insulated conductors 
are bonded to a carrier film, addresses this problem. The film is 
generally of a polymeric material similar to that of the insulation 
and in order to achieve a bond between the insulated conductors 
and the film, the film must be heated to about its melting point. At 
these temperatures it is difficult to maintain the dimensions of the 
film and this can lead to improper alignment of the wires and even 
buckling and shrinking of the film. Further, it has been found that 
with certain polymeric materials it is difficult to separate an 
individual insulated conductor from the carrier film unless the 
bond strength is well controlled. If the bond is too strong, peeling 
will then destroy the carrier film or the conductor insulation. It is 
desirable to be able to peel the individual insulated conductors from 
the film as cleanly as possible. All such problems, we have 
discovered, are prevalent, and sometimes unavoidable using prior 
art methods, when polymer film is heated above its melting point 
to enhance adhesion, especially when polymer film has a high 
melting point, for example, over 200°C or when the film is thin, for 
example less than 2.0 mil. We have also discovered that, for 
optimum adhesion, the film should be heated to a higher 
temperature close to the ring and ball softening temperature of the 
polymer material. We have also found that when using prior art 
methods of thermal bonding at a sufficiently high temperature to 
ensure good adhesion, the bond strength between the cable 
insulation and the carrier film varies erratically and even under  
 
nominally identical process conditions, the average bond strength can vary widely from 
one production run to the next. U.S. Patents Nos. 4,625,074 and 4,678,864 to Cox, and 4,767,891 to Biegon et 
al. describe attempts to obtain a flat cable having dimensional stability at elevated 
temperatures
