<ABSTRACT>
A nonswitched power circuit energises volatile 
memories of electronic devices in an automobile. When the 

main vehicle battery (10) is present and providing power, 
the volatile memories (26) are energised by the main battery 

(10) through a diode (12). The main battery (10) also 
maintains a rechargeable battery (16) in a charged state. 

When the main battery voltage drops due to a discharged or 
disconnected main battery (10), the rechargeable battery 

(16) maintains power to the volatile memories. The 
rechargeable battery (16) may be included as part of a 

flashlight for providing a portable, rechargeable light 
source.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to providing 
electrical power for volatile memories in electrical 
equipment used in transportation vehicles, and more 
specifically to a backup rechargeable battery for providing 
power to volatile memories during failure of a primary power 
source. Many types of electrical equipment in automobiles, 
such as an engine control computer, an audio system, and a 
clock, take advantage of volatile electronic (semiconductor) 
memory for storing information used by the equipment. A 
volatile memory retains information only as long as 
energising power is applied, but has advantages of low cost, 
small size, and the ability to have the memory contents 
rewritten numerous times. Non-volatile, rewriteable memory 
that maintains its memory contents without continuous 
application of power is available and is often used for 
critical information storage, but suffers from the 
disadvantages of greater expense and larger size. Thus, to 
minimise cost, noncritical information is typically kept in 
volatile memory in many types of electrical equipment. For 
example, a automotive audio system typically employs 
volatile memory for storing radio station resets, last 
volume setting, last station tuned, and other radio and 
audio control information in volatile memories. Automotive 
clocks having digital displays typically use volatile memory 
exclusively whether the clock is contained as part of the 
audio system or is a separate unit contained on a vehicle 
dashboard. An electronic engine control (EEC) computer 
employs volatile memory for various adaptive engine 
parameters for optimising performance such as idle airflow. In prior art automotive electrical systems, the 
electrical equipment including the volatile memories 
receives electrical power from a main vehicle battery. A  
 
failure of the vehicle battery due to its discharge or 
removal results in the loss of information from volatile 
memories powered by the vehicle battery. Therefore, each 
occurrence of a dead battery or replacement of a battery 
necessitates reprogramming of volatile memories to restore 
the lost information. For example, an automobile user must 
manually reset a clock and manually re-enter the desired 
radio station presets after failure of the main battery. 
With regard to lost memory contents in the EEC, engine 
operation can be established using base values with 
subsequent redetermination of lost parameter values; 
however, engine performance and emissions may suffer during 
the interim time
