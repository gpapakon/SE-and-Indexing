<ABSTRACT>
A disc drive actuator load beam 25 is directly welded to a stainless steel 
arm 248. The direct welding eliminates the need for swage plates having swage 

bosses and permits reduced arm thickness. This, in turn, accommodates reduced 
disc spacing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a directly welded load beam flexure 
assembly in a magnetic disc drive and more particularly to, but not exclusively 
to, rotary actuator suspension systems therefor. Most small form factor disc drives (Figure 1) today employ rotary 
actuators 22 to support the drive's magnetic heads 30 as the heads fly over the 
rotating surfaces 5 of the disc drive magnetic discs 7. Such rotary actuators 
essentially comprise an electric motor 35, a fixed shaft 37, a hub 39 rotatably 
mounted on the fixed shaft through a bearing system 41, a plurality of arms 20 
extending from the hub, one or sometimes, two flexible load beams 25 mounted 
on the end of the arm extending in line from the respective arms and a gimbal 43 
attached to the end of each load beam. A magnetic head 30 is attached to the 
gimbal 43. In most cases - especially with voice coil rotary actuators - the motor 
comprises a coil 45 fixedly attached to the actuator hub which magnetically 
interacts with one or more magnets 47 fixedly mounted on the drive casing 17. The disc drive typically has a vertical stack of two or more discs 7. (See 
Figure 2.) The rotary actuator 22 is designed such that a portion of the arms 20, 
load beams 25 and the magnetic heads 30 extend into the spaces between the 
surfaces 5. Another, and currently preferred, structure for the prior art arm and load 
beam assembly is shown in Figure 3. This figure shows aluminium arm 20 to 
which a stainless steel load beam 25 is attached by means of a swage plate 45 
having an integral swage boss 50. Typically, the swage plate 45 is welded to the 
load beam 25 through a plurality of welds aligned in a pattern to support the load 
beam against virtual bending forces and side to side acceleration. Arm 20 is part  
 
of a unitary hub (not shown) formed by extrusion. Such structures are 
commonly known as E-blocks. In practice, all loads beams are simultaneously 
swayed to their respective arms. Also shown in this figure are wire attachment tabs 55 and head 30. Head 
30 has a transducer, not shown, which will be operative when facing a disc, as 
in Figures 1 and 2. When a pair of these preferred load beams are attached to a single arm 
(see Figure 2), one 28 will have its head's transducer facing upwards and the 
other 29 facing downwards. Because the end of the arm must fit between the 
discs 7, the stack height of two swage plates 45 and two swage bosses 50 
becomes a limiting factor to closer disc spacing. According to the present invention there is
