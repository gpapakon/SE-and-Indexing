<ABSTRACT>
Stable, autoreversible, water-miscible water-in-oil dispersions consisting of an oil phase, an aqueous phase and at least two emulsifying agents at least one of which is of water-in-oil type and at least one is of oil-in-water type, which contain from 20 to 50 % by weight of a mixture consisting of a water-soluble anionic polymer belonging to the group of carboxymethyl celluloses (C) and of a crosslinked synthetic anionic polymer which is insoluble in water but swellable with water (P), based on acrylic acid (AA) partially converted into salt with an alkali metal (M), optionally copolymerised with 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulphonate of alkali metal M (AMPSM), crosslinked with a diethylenic carboxylic acid, and in which the molar ratio of the acidic functional groups converted into salt to the total of the acidic function groups which are free or converted into salt is between approximately 0.6 and approximately 0.9, the weight ratio C/P+C being between 0.01 and 0.4, process for their preparation and use for obtaining a printing paste.

Self-reversible, stable, water-in-oil dispersions,
miscible with water, constituted by an oil phase, an aqueous

phase and at least two emulsifying agents of which at least
one is of water-in-oil type, and at least one is of oil-in-water

type, characterized in that, in relation to the total
weight of dispertions, the oil phase represents 15 to 35% by

weight and the water 25 to 60%, and in that they contain 20
to 50% by weight of a mixture constituted by a hydrosoluble

anionic polymer belonging to the group of
carboxymethylcelluloses, designated C, and by a cross-linked,

synthetic anionic polymer, insoluble in water but water-swellable,
designated P, based on acrylic acid, designated

AA, partially salified with an alkali metal, designated M,
optionally copolymerized with 2-acrylamido 2-methyl

propanesulphonate of the alkali metal M, designated AMPSM,
cross-linked with a diethylenic carboxylic acid and in which

the molar ratio of the salified acid functions to the total
number of free or salified acid functions is comprised

between about 0.6 and about 0.9, the ratio by weight C/P+C
being comprised between 0.01 and 0.5, M being chosen from

sodium and potassium.
Dispersions according to claim 1, characterized in
that they contain from 20 to 50% by weight of a mixture of

carboxymethylcellulose, C, and by 90 to 50% by weight of a

cross-linked polymer, P, AA-AAM-AMPSM containing in molar
proportions 0 to 30% of AMPSM and 100 to 70% of an AA and AAM

mixture containing in molar proportions 20 to 40% of AA and
80 to 60% of AAM, cross-linked with 0.01 to 0.06% in molar

polymerization reaction in a water-in-oil emulsion is carried
out, starting with an aqueous solution containing the

constitutive monomers of polymer P, and optionally a

presence of one or more emulsifying agents of water-in-oil

introduction into the starting emulsion of a product
generating free radicals or a Redox pair, then, when the

polymerization reaction is completed, one or more emulsifying
