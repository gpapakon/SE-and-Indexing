<ABSTRACT>
A high pressure fuel hose (58) for 
disposition between a check valve (30) on a fuel pump 

canister (22) in a fuel reservoir (20) and a fluid 
connector through the reservoir wall has a flexible 

tubular body formed with a plurality of annular 
sinusoidal convolutions (60) operative to accept 

volumetric and pressure increases in fuel trapped 
between the check valve (30) and the fuel delivery 

system caused by temperature loading of the fuel 
following engine shut-down. A region (64) of reduced 

wall thickness is formed in the tubular body to act as 
a pressure fuse having a predetermined burst pressure, 

thereby to allow the location of any system leakage 
due to over-pressurisation to be controlled.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fuel 
system for an internal combustion engine and to 
pressure fuse therefor, as specified in the preamble 
of claim 1. Such a fuel system is known, for example, 
from EP-A-0459556. Manufacturing economies are realised by 
grouping several related components into a modular 
assembly which may be handled, installed and serviced 
as a unit. For example, in automotive fuel systems 
modular fuel delivery systems have been proposed for 
direct installation in a fuel tank. Such systems are 
typically installed through an opening in the top of 
the fuel tank and may include an electric fuel pump, a 
cover for the tank opening, elements for supporting 
the pump relative to the cover and means for 
electrically and fluidly connecting the pump to the 
electrical and fuel delivery systems of the internal 
combustion engine. A flexible, high pressure hose 
constructed of rubber or flexible plastics material 
may be provided as a conduit between the pump outlet 
and the cover, with a check valve disposed downstream 
of the pump and operable to maintain fuel system 
pressure following engine and fuel system shut-down. The present invention seeks to provide an 
improved fuel system and pressure fuse therefor. To this end, a fuel system in accordance 
with the present invention is characterised by the 
features specified in the characterising part of claim 
1. The elastomeric hose includes structural 
features which can manage positive fuel pressure 
variation of fuel between the check valve and fuel 
injectors of a fuel delivery system.  
 The elastomeric hose is preferably 
constructed of a fuel resistant, blow-mouldable 
elastomer such as commonly available NYLON 11 and 
preferably includes a flexible tubular body including 
a plurality of annular sinusoidal convolutions. The 
ends of the tubular body fluidly connect the outlet of 
the fuel pump to a fluid connector disposed through 
the wall of the reservoir. The fuel conduit, external 
to the fuel tank, conducts fuel delivered to the fluid 
connector in the tank wall to the fuel delivery 
components of the engine. As an aid to engine start, 
the check valve is preferably disposed at the 
interface of the fuel pump and the elastomeric hose to 
maintain fuel within the fuel conduit following 
shut-down of the engine and fuel system. With the advent of non-return demand fuel 
systems for the reduction of running loss hydrocarbon 
emissions, fuel held between the check valve and the 
fuel injectors may, under certain circumstances

<CLAIMS>
A fuel system for an internal combustion 
engine including a fuel reservoir (20) including a 

pump assembly (22) disposed therein, fuel delivery 
means (14,16) in operable communication with the 

engine and a fuel conduit (18) extending between the 
fuel reservoir and the fuel delivery means; the fuel 

reservoir including an electric fuel pump, check valve 
means (30) disposed in operable communication with an 

outlet of the fuel pump, and an elastomeric hose (58) 
extending between the check valve means and the fuel 

conduit; the hose including a flexible body, 
characterised in that the hose further comprises a 

region (64) of reduced wall thickness operable to 
accommodate pressure variation in the fuel system 

through expansion of the flexible body and to rupture 
at the region of reduced wall thickness when pressure 

within the hose exceeds a threshold pressure level.  
 
A fuel system according to claim 1, 
including a fluid connector disposed in a wall of the 

fuel reservoir operable to connect the elastomeric 
hose to the fuel conduit, the elastomeric hose being 

disposed within the fuel reservoir, wherein rupture of 
the region of reduced wall thickness is confined to 

the fuel reservoir. 
A fuel system according to claim 1 or 2, 
wherein the flexible body of the hose is formed with a 

plurality of convolutions (60) enabling expansion of 
the tube. 
A fuel system according to claim 3, 
wherein the convolutions are sinusoidal.
