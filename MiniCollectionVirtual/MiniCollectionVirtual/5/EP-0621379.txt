<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for suspending ceilings, composed of an elongate sheet-metal-profile basic body, of a device for connecting to a ceiling-side screw at one end of the basic body, of a corresponding second sheet-metal-profile portion which is fitted at the free lower end, engages around the basic-body profile and, for its part, is provided at its free lower ends with a fastening device for carrying rails or the like, and of an arresting device for fixing in an end position set between basic-body profile and the second sheet-metal profile. In the case of said device for suspending ceilings, in order to achieve simple handling during mounting, while maintaining cost-effective producibility and a high end retaining force, it is provided that the second sheet-metal profile (10) can be positioned onto the basic-body profile (1) such that at least two legs (12) of the second sheet-metal profile (10) engage around the basic-body profile (1) such that stable-end-position frictional locking results, the position which has been set in this manner being infinitely fixable by means of the arresting device.
