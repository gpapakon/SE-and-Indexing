<ABSTRACT>
An Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor has a gate in the form of a trench positioned in a p
region in a silicon body. The device operates in a thyristor mode having a virtual emitter

which is formed during operation by the generation of an inversion layer at the bottom
of the trench within the p region. The device is inherently safe and turns off rapidly as

removal of a gate signal collapses the emitter. As the trench gate is situated within the
p region, it can withstand high voltages when turned off as the reverse electric field is

prevented from reaching the trench gate

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to semiconductor devices, and is particularly concerned with trench
devices, ie devices in which at least one electrode is set into the wall or bottom or forms
part of a trench or recess below a major, usually planar, surface of a semiconductor
device. The use of trenches is particularly advantageous for devices such as IGBT's
(insulated gate bipolar transistors) which are capable of operating at high power and
voltage levels. The limit on the upper value of voltage at which such devices can be used
is determined by the breakdown voltage of a device. For a device which is capable of
operating at high power and at high voltage levels, it is important that the device has a
low on-state resistance and turns-off (ie current flow through the device ceases) promptly
and reliably in response to a turn-off signal. It has proved difficult to produce such a
device which reliably meets the conflicting requirements of high current, high voltage
operation and a safe, reliable current control characteristic.The present invention seeks to provide an improved semiconductor device.According to a first aspect of this invention, a semiconductor trench device includes an
active region having one or more trenches extending from a first surface thereof with at
least one p-n junction across which current flow is controllable by a field effect gate
electrode disposed at a wall region of the trench and which electrode is operative to
produce an inversion layer in a first semiconductor region of a first conductivity type, at
least a bottom portion of said trench remote from said first surface being positioned in
said first semiconductor region, said first region being adjacent a second semiconductor 
region of a second conductivity type and which is located between said first region and
an anode region which is of said first conductivity type, said gate electrode being
operative in use to cause said inversion layer to initiate carrier injection into said first and
second regions thereby producing a thyristor action in which the inversion layer, whilst
it is present, acts as an emitter thereof.According to a second aspect of this invention, a semiconductor trench device includes
an active region having one or more trenches extending from a first surface thereof with
at least one p-n junction across which current flow is controllable by a field effect gate
electrode disposed at a wall region of the trench and which electrode is operative to
produce an inversion layer in an adjacent first p type region, at
