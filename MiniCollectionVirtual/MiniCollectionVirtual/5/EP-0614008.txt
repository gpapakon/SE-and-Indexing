<ABSTRACT>
An electromagnetically operated fixed displacement 
pump is sought, which can cope with diversification of 

electromagnetically operated fixed displacement pump 
products, and internationalization of their destination, 

readily permits cost reduction by mass production and permits 
efficient supply and control of products. 
A terminal portion 12 electrically connected to the 
electromagnetic coil 20 projects from the top of the pump 

body 10. A control unit 14 with a control section for 
controlling the stroke number is removably mounted on the 

terminal unit. The pump body 10 is supplied with current 
from lead pins of a power source connector 64 provided on 

the control unit 14 through the terminal portion 12. The 
control unit 14 is prepared according to the specifications 

of various pump products. Various control units 14 thus can

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electromagnetically 
operated fixed displacement pump, which comprises an 
electromagnetically reciprocating member such as a diaphragm 
plunger and an electromagnet including an electromagnetic 
coil driving the reciprocating member and an armature and 
executes a pumping operation according to a preset 
discharge rate. This type of pump is known and disclosed in, for 
instance, in United Sates Patent No. 4,537,565. The 
disclosed pump comprises a pump body, a pump head provided 
at an end thereof in the axial direction and having an 
inlet port and a discharge port, the pump body 
accommodating an electromagnetic coil, a movable armature 
movable in the axial direction of the pump body with 
energization of the coil and a reciprocating member movable 
in unison with the armature in the axial direction of the 
pump body, the pump head having a pump chamber defined 
therein and communicating with the inlet port and the 
discharge port via valve means, the volume of the pump 
chamber being varied with the reciprocation of the 
reciprocating member to obtain pumping operation, a stroke 
adjustment assembly disposed on the side of the pump body 
opposite the pump head in the axial direction of the pump body  
 
for adjusting the stroke of the armature, the stroke adjustment 
assembly including a stop member displaceable in the axial 
direction of the pump body, a rotary knob constituting an 
operating means for causing the displacement of the stop member 
by external manual rotating operation, and coupling 
means operatively coupling the rotary knob and the stop 
member, a stroke number control means for adjustably 
selecting the frequency of energization of the 
electromagnetic coil to thereby control the stroke member 
of the armature, the pump body being provided with power 
source connection means for energizing the electromagnetic 
coil. The pump disclosed in the above United States Patent No. 
4,537,565 is a commonly termed diaphragm pump employing a 
diaphragm as a reciprocating member. United States Patent No. 4,272,225 discloses a 
commonly termed plunger type pump using a plunger as a 
reciprocating member. In either of these electromagnetically operated fixed 
displacement pumps, it is necessary to adjust the stroke of 
the reciprocating member in dependence on the kind of the 
operating fluid supplied to the pump used in various fields 
and the preset discharge rate. In addition, for the 
adjustment of the stroke number of the reciprocating member 
it is necessary
