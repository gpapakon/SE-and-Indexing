<ABSTRACT>
A process for converting a heavy hydrocarbonaceous chargestock to lower boiling products which process comprises reacting the chargestock with a catalyst concentrate in the presence of hydrogen, at hydroconversion conditions, said catalyst concentrate having been prepared by the steps comprising: (a) forming a precursor catalyst concentrate by mixing together: (i) a hydrocarbonaceous oil comprising constituents boiling above about 570  DEG C; (ii) a metal compound, said metal being selected from the group consisting of Groups II, III, IV, V, VIB, VIIB and VIII of the Periodic Table of the Elements, in an amount to provide from about 0.2 to 2 wt. % metal, based on said hydrocarbonaceous oil; and (b) heating the precursor concentrate to an effective temperature to produce a catalyst concentrate, wherein elemental sulfur is used as the sulfiding agent in an amount such that the atomic ratio of sulfur to metal is from about 1/1 to 8/1.

<DESCRIPTION>
HYDROCONVERSION PROCESS USING A SULFIDED MOLYBDENUM CATALYST CONCENTRATEFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to a hydroconversion process for converting a heavy hydrocarbonaceous feedstock to lower boiling products, which process involves the use of a sulfided catalyst concentrate which is prepared by use of elemental sulfur as the sulfϊding source.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThere is substantial interest in the petroleum industry for converting heavy hydrocarbonaceous feedstocks to lower boiling liquids. One type of process suitable for hydroconversion of heavy feedstocks is a slurry process using a catalyst prepared in a hydrocarbon oil from a thermally-decomposable, metal compound catalyst precursor. The catalyst is formed in situ in the hydroconversion zone.Further, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,740,295 and 4,740,489, both of which are incorporated herein by reference, teach a method wherein the catalyst is prepared from a phosphomolybdic acid precursor concentrate. The precursor concentrate is sulfided prior to the final catalyst formation. This presulfiding step is taught to produce a catalyst having greater control over coke formation. The sulfϊding agent in these two patents requires a hydrogen-sulfide containing gas or a hydrogen-sulfide precursor and the resulting catalyst concentrate is used for hydroconversion of heavy hydrocarbonaceous materials to lower boiling products.The term "hydroconversion" with reference to a hydrocarbo¬ naceous oil, is used herein to designate a catalytic process conducted in the 

 presence of hydrogen in which at least a portion of the heavy constituents of the oil is converted to lower boiling products. The simultaneous reduction of the concentration of nitrogenous compounds, sulfur compounds and metallic constituents of the oil may also result.All boiling points referenced herein are atmospheric pressure equivalent boiling points unless otherwise specified.It has been found that introducing a catalyst precursor as a concentrate in a hydrocarbonaceous oil into a hydroconversion zone containing a heavy hydrocarbonaceous chargestock has certain advantages when compared with a process wherein the catalyst precursor is introduced into the hydrocon¬ version zone without first forming a concentrate; that is, by introducing the catalyst precursor directly into the feed in the reactor. The advantages include: (i) ease of mixing the precursor with a small stream instead of the whole feed; (ii) the ability to store the precursor concentrate for future use and/or activity

 CLAIMS
1. A process for converting a heavy hydrocarbonaceous chargestock to lower boiling products which process comprises reacting said hydrocarbonaceous chargestock in the presence of hydrogen, at hydroconversion conditions which include a hydrogen partial-pressure from 50 to 5000 psig and a temperature from about 650 to 900°F, in the presence of a catalyst concentrate having been prepared by the steps comprising:
(a) forming a precursor concentrate by mixing: (i) a hydrocarbonaceous oil comprising constituents boiling above about 570°C; (ii) a metal compound, said metal being selected from the group consisting of Groups IVB, VB, VIB, VIIB and VII of the Periodic Table of the Elements, in an amount to provide from about 0.2 to 2 wt% metal based on said hydrocarbonaceous oil; and
(b) heating the concentrate, in the substantial absence of added hydrogen, at a temperature from about 275°C to about 425°C and a total pressure of from about 0 psig to about 500 psig, for a time sufficient to convert said catalyst precursor to a solid molybdenum-containing catalyst.
wherein elemental sulfur is used as a sulfiding agent at any stage of the catalyst preparation in an amount so that the atomic ratio of elemental sulfur to metal is about 1/1 to 8/1.
2. The process of claim 1 wherein the elemental sulfur is added to the hydrocarbonaceous chargestock prior to addition of the metal compound.
3. The process of claim 1 wherein the hydrocarbonaceous oil of step (a) comprises a blend of gas oil and a vacuum residuum. 


 4. The process of claim 2 wherein the hydrocarbonaceous oil of step (a) is an atmospheric distillation residuum.

6. The process of claim 5 wherein the amount of sulfur is such that the atomic ratio of sulphur to molybdenum is from about 2/1 to 7/1.
7. The process of claim 6 wherein the amount of phosphomolybdic acid is such that it provides about 0.2 to 1 wt% Mo, based on said hydrocarbonaceous chargestock, and wherein the elemental sulfur
