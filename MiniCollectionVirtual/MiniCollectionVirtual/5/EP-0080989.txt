<ABSTRACT>
A device in freight handling gear comprising two lifting 
arms which are mounted on a vehicle chassis. The lifting 

arms (6) are arranged to perform parallel movements to load 
and unload container-type load carriers in the lengthwise 

direction. 
The lifting arms (6) are mounted on a carriage (4) which 
is arranged for movement in the lengthwise direction of the 

vehicle. The carriage serves as a guide in which the lifting 
arms (6) are movable towards and away from one another in 

the transverse direction of the vehicle chassis.

A Device in Vehicle-Mounted Lifting Arms
Inventor: Per Josef   BÃ¶rje    Fransson, Engineer
 The subject invention concerns a device in freight handling gear comprising two lifting arms which are mounted on a vehicle chassis and which are arranged to perform parallel movements for the purpose of loading and unloading load carriers in the lengthwise direction.


 Goods vehicles designed to transport containerized loads are often equipped with hoisting gear by means of which the containers can be lifted onto and off the vehicle. It is desirable that the equipment is designed to allow loading and transport of containers of maximum width, that is, the maximum width allowed on public roads. Hitherto, only vehicles equipped with hoisting gear of side-loading type could be used for handling and transport of containers of that size.


 One disadvantage inherent in vehicles equipped with side-loaders is that this type of hoisting gear requires comparatively large space for loading and unloading operations. Vehicles equipped with hoisting gear able to handle containers in the lengthwise direction of the vehicle are more useful and versatile but are not capable of handling maximum-width containers.


 The subject invention has for its purpose to provide a freight handling gear allowing maximum-width containers to be loaded and handled in the lengthwise direction of the goods vehicle.


 The freight handling gear in accordance with the invention is characterised in that the two lifting arms  are mounted   on    a carriage, said carriage arranged for movement in the lengthwise direction of the vehicle chassis and serving as a guide and in that the lifting arms are arranged for movement in said guide towards or away from one another in the transverse direction of the vehicle chassis.


 The invention will be described in closer detail in the following with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein
 Fig. 1 is a lateral view of a goods vehicle equipped with freight handling gear in accordance with the invention, the freight handling gear being shown in four different positions,
 Fig. 2 is a broken view of the chassis of the goods vehicle including the carriage arranged for movement in the lengthwise direction of the chassis,
 Fig. 3 is an end view of the truck, and
 Fig. 4 illustrates the carriage in a sectional view from above.


 In the drawings, Fig. 1 illustrates a lorry, designated by numeral 1, which is provided with a load-receiving surface 2 to support containers. Two lengthwise rails 3 are arranged on

Claims



 1. A device in freight handling gear comprising two lifting arms, which arms are mounted on a vehicle chassis and which are arranged to perform parallel movements to load and   unldad    load carriers in the lengthwise direction, c h a r a c t e r i s e d i n that
 the lifting arms (6) are mounted on a carriage (4), said carriage arranged for movement in the lengthwise direction of the vehicle chassis and serving as a guide, said lifting arms (6) being arranged for movement in said guide towards and away from one another in the transverse direction of the vehicle chassis.




 2. A device in freight handling gear as claimed in claim 1, c h a r a c t e r i s e d i n t h a t the carriage is provided with a cross piece   (11)    consisting of square tubing, said two lifting arms (6) non-rotatably supported at opposite ends of said cross piece (11) by means of two members (12), each such member being fast with and projecting angularly from its respective one of said lifting arms.

 


 3. A device in freight handling gear as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, c h a r a c t e r i s e d i n t h a t said angularly projecting members (12) are interconnected by a rack and pinion mechanism comprising two racks   (15,    17), each one of which is   se-    cured to its respective one of said angular members (12), and a pinion (16), which pinion engages in said twp racks (15, 17) in such a manner that upon displacement  of one of the angularly projecting members (12) in one lateral direction, for instance with the aid of a piston-and-cylinder unit (13), the opposite angular member (12) will be displaced correspondingly in the opposite lateral direction.
