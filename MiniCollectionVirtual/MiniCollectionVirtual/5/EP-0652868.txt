<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to substituted phenyl compounds, their
preparation, pharmaceutical compositions containing these compounds, and
their use for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of disease states associated with
proteins that mediate cellular activity.Disease states associated with abnormally high physiological levels of
cytokines such as TNF are treatable according to the invention. TNF is an
important pro-inflammatory cytokine which causes hemorrhagic necrosis of
tumors and possesses other important biological activities. TNF is released by
activated macrophages, activated T-lymphocytes, natural killer cells, mast cells
and basophils, fibroblasts, endothelial cells and brain astrocytes among other
cells.The principal in vivo actions of TNF can be broadly classified as
inflammatory and catabolic. It has been implicated as a mediator of endotoxic
shock, inflammation of joints and of the airways, immune deficiency states.
allograft rejection, and in the cachexia associated with malignant disease and
some parasitic infections. In view of the association of high serum levels of
TNF with poor prognosis in sepsis, graft versus host disease and acute
respiratory distress syndrome, and its role in many other immunologic
processes, this factor is regarded as an important mediator of general
inflammation.TNF primes or activates neutrophils, eosinophils, fibroblasts and
endothelial cells to release tissue damaging mediators. TNF also activates
monocytes, macrophages and T-lymphocytes to cause the production of colony 
colony stimulating factors and other pro-inflammatory cytokines such IL1, IL6,
IL8 and GM-CSF, which in some case mediate the end effects of TNF. The
ability of TNF to activate T-lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages and related
cells has been implicated in the progression of Human Immunodeficiency
Virus (HIV) infection. In order for these cells to become infected with HIV and
for HIV replication to take place the cells must be maintained in an activated
state. Cytokines such as TNF have been shown to activate HIV replication in
monocytes and macrophages. Features of endotoxic shock such as fever,
metabolic acidosis, hypotension and intravascular coagulation are thought to
be mediated through the actions of TNF on the hypothalamus and in reducing
the anti-coagulant activity of vascular endothelial cells. The cachexia
associated with certain disease states is mediated through indirect effects on
protein catabolism. TNF also promotes bone resorption and acute phase
protein
