<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the direct dyeing of keratinous fibres, which consists in bringing keratinous fibres, to which a composition containing at least one direct dye bearing at least one sulphonic function has been applied, into contact with a gas containing water vapour, the temperature of the aforementioned gas being above 75 DEG C and the contact time between the aforementioned gas and the aforementioned fibres to be dyed being less than two minutes. This process enables excellent dyeing results to be obtained in extremely limited times and without risk of staining the skin or scalp.

<CLAIMS>
Process for directly dyeing keratinous fibres 
without risk of staining the skin or the scalp, 

characterized in that it consists in bringing keratinous 
fibres, to which a composition containing at least one 

direct dye containing a sulphonic functional group has 
been applied, into contact with a gas containing water 

vapour, the temperature of the said gas being greater 
than 75°C and the contact time between the said gas and 

the said fibres to be dyed being less than two minutes. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the gas has a temperature greater than or equal to 

85°C. 
Process according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the gas has a temperature between 85 and 150°C. 
Process according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the gas is brought into 

contact with the fibre to be dyed for a period of time 
ranging from 0.01 second to 2 minutes. 
Process according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that the gas is brought into contact with the fibre to be 

dyed for a period of time ranging from 0.01 second to 30 
seconds. 
Process according to Claim 5, characterized in 
that the gas is brought into contact with the fibre to be 

dyed for a period of time ranging from 0.5 second to 10 
seconds. 
Process according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that application of the gas is 

repeated a number of times on the same fibre. 
Process according to any one of the preceding  
 

claims, characterized in that the gas contains solely 
water vapour. 
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 7, 
charact
erized in that the gas contains water vapour and 
at least one other compound in the form of gas or vapour. 
Process according to Claim 9, characterized in 
that the gas contains water vapour and air. 
Process according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the direct dyes containing 

sulphonic functional groups are chosen from the compounds 
denoted under the code C.I. 60730, C.I. 15510, 

C.I. 47005, C.I. 15985, C.I. 17200, C.I. 20470, 
C.I. 42090 and C.I. 61570 in the Colour Index. 
Process according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the direct dyes containing 

sulphonic functional groups are present in concentrations 
ranging from 0.01 to 10 % by weight with respect to the 

total weight of the composition. 
Process according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the composition containing 

at least one direct dye containing a sulphonic functional 
group has a pH of between 2 and 11.
