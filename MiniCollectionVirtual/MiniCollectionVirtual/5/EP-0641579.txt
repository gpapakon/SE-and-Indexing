<ABSTRACT>
The invention is based on a toy figure for a table ball game, in particular for a table football game, which toy figure (1) comprises a disc-like base (3) which is rotationally symmetrical about a base axis and has a base diameter (D1) and a base height (H1), and further comprises a figure (2), the base (3) being delimited on its underside by a planar base undersurface (10) with a diameter (D2) and, on its upper side by a base top surface (7) which is bordered by a base upper edge (8) and on which the figure (2) extending in the direction of the base axis is fitted. In the case of such a toy figure (1), play is improved in that the diameter (D2) of the base under surface (10) is more than 55% and up to virtually 100% of the base diameter (D1).

Playing figure (1) for a table football game playable with a ball,
said playing figure comprising a disk-like base (3) rotationally symmetrical

about a base axis for playing the ball with a base diameter (D1) and
a base height (H1), as well as a figure (2), the base (3) being defined on

its underside by a planar base bottom surface (10) with a diameter (D2) and
on its top side by a base top surface (7) bounded by a base upper edge (8)

and to said base top surface (7) is fitted in the direction of the base
axis the figure (2), and in which the weight of the base (3) is formed by

the base material, the base (3) is made from a solid material and the base
(3) is constructed in one piece, characterized in that the diameter (D2)

of the base bottom surface (10) is between 57 and 76%, preferably approximately
66% of the base diameter (D1).
Playing figure according to claim 1, characterized in that the base
upper edge (8) is inclined in the manner of a bevel and has a width (B3),

which is between 15 and 40%, preferably approximately 27% of the base
height (H1).
Playing figure according to claim 1, characterized in that the base (3)
between the base upper edge (8) and the base bottom surface (10) is outwardly

bounded by a circumferential base curvature (11), whose radius of
curvature (r) is preferably approximately 38% of the base diameter (D1).
Playing figure according to claim 3, characterized in that between the
base upper edge (8) and the base curvature (11) is provided a vertically

standing, circumferential base border (9), which has a height (H3) between
3 and 30%, preferably approximately 3.6% of the base height (H1).
Playing figure according to one of the claims 2 to 4, characterized in
that the base upper edge (8) forms with the horizontal an angle (w) between

40 and 80°, preferably 61.5°.
Playing figure according to one of the claims 1 to 5, characterized in
that the base height (H1) is between 20 and 27%, preferably approximately 

27.2% of the base diameter (D1).
Playing figure according to one of the claims 1 to 6, characterized in
that the figure (2) has a height (H2), which is between 125 and 180%,

preferably approximately 147% of the base diameter (D1).
Playing figure according to claim 7, characterized in that the figure
(2) is plate-like and its marginal contour is symmetrical to a median plane

and is centred on the base (3).
Playing figure according to claim 8, characterized in that the figure
(2) has a head (6), shoulders (5) with a shoulder width (B1) and legs (4),

said legs (4) terminating with a foot width (B2) on the base top surface
(7), that the foot width (B2) is smaller than the shoulder width (B1), and

that the marginal contour between the legs (4) and the shoulders (5) is
concave.
Playing figure according to one of the claims 1 to 9, characterized in
that the weight of the figure (2) is no more than 12.5%, particularly

between 8 and 9% of the weight of the base (3).
Playing figure according to claim 10, characterized in that the base
(3) is made from polystyrene PS with a density of 1.05 g/cm
3
 and the
figure (2) from Styropor with a density of 60 to 150 g/dm
3
.
Table football game with a ball and a plurality of playing figures,
which are in each case equipped with a base for playing the ball, characterized

in that the playing figures are in each case constructed according
to one of the claims 1 to 11.
