<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a process and devices 
for continuously measuring the concentration of an analyte 

in tissue, which comprises providing said tissue with a 
hollow fiber having a pore size between the size of the 

analyte and the size of macromolecules, perfunding said 
hollow fiber with a solution compatible with the tissue, 

leading that solution from the hollow fiber through a 
reactor for the analyte, which reactor comprises a second 

hollow fiber having a pore size between the size of the 
analyte and the size of macromolecules, said hollow fiber 

being located in a container which comprises macromolecular 
reactants for detecting the analyte and a signal producing 

system coupled therewith, after which the perfusion fluid is 
lead from the reactor to an eliminator for the analyte, 

whereby at least 95% of the remaining analyte is removed 

from the perfusion fluid and reintroducing said perfusion 
fluid in said first hollow fiber. 
This is a closed circuit and therefore this method can 
be continued over a longer period of time than the methods 

of the prior art, without the need to replace reservoirs.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to processes for continuously
measuring the concentration of an analyte in tissue.It also relates to devices for said measurements and to
devices which make such measurements and respond by
administering an active substance.In medical science, both human and veterinary, a very
important criterion for diagnosis and or treatment is the
level of certain substances in blood and/or tissue.The substances of interest (hereinafter referred to as
analytes) can be of a wide variety. They can be intermediates
or endproducts in metabolism, hormones or hormoneprecursors,
antibodies or antigens, pathogens, drugs, etc.In a number of cases it will be important to keep a
continuous check on levels of an analyte in blood and/or
tissue.The analyte which up until now has been the foremost
subject in continuous measurements is glucose in patients
suffering from diabetes mellitus.Though the invention is explained more in detail using
glucose as a model system, it is by no means restricted in its
use to that kind of measurement only.Processes and devices for continuously measuring glucose
concentrations in (subcutaneous) tissue are known.It has also been proposed to couple such a measuring
device to a wearable insulin pump which then reacts to changes
in the blood and/or tissue glucose level. Generally speaking, these methods and devices are used
for patients for whom the classical methods of injecting
insulin once or twice a day cannot provide a satisfactory
regulation of the glucose (blood) level in the patient.However, if a patient friendly device for measuring
analytes such as glucose and dosing a substance such as
insulin in reaction to changes in the analyte concentration
could be designed, the use of such devices could be far more
widespread then this particular group of patients.Several research groups are involved in designing
glucose sensors. One of those research groups is the group of
Shichiri of the "First Department of Medicine" at the
university of Osaka, Japan. This group succeeded [see
Diabetologia 24 (1983) 179-184; Biomed. Biochim. Acta 43
(1984), 561-568; Diabetes Care 9 (1986) 298-301] in developing
a glucose sensor capable of measuring the glucose
concentration in subcutaneous tissue for three days. The small
needle-type glucose sensor consists of a platinum electrode
covered with immobilized enzyme glucose oxidase. In the
reaction of glucose with oxygen in the presence of the enzyme
H2O2 is released which can be measured by this electrode and
correlates with the amount of glucose
