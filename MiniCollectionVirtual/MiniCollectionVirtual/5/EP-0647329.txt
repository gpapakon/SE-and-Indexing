<ABSTRACT>
A self-supporting adhesive sheeting material useful in making blanks for laminated windows comprises a continuous web (10) which has a uniform thickness profile (A, B) across at least 20 % of its area extending from each edge of the web and a wedge-shaped thickness profile (C, D) which decreases in thickness from the area of uniform thickness to the center of the web, and a process comprising extruding an adhesive composition through an adjustable extrusion die to provide a continuous self-supporting web having a uniform thickness profile across at least 20 % of the area of the web extending inwardly from each edge of the web and a wedge-shaped thickness profile decreasing in thickness from the area of uniform thickness to the center of the web, quenching the web, slitting the web along its mid-point, and winding the slit web onto separate rolls.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to shaped interlayers useful in preparing 
head-up displays for windshields. Head-up instrument displays (HUD) for vehicles have been 
used to provide virtual images that appear to be located ahead of the vehicle 
windshield toward the front of the vehicle. These displays provide the 
advantage of increased safety since the operator does not have to divert 
attention significantly from viewing the outside to check the instrument 
status. Most conventional windshields are made by placing a layer of 
adhesive, e.g. polyvinyl butyral (PVB) or polyurethane, which has a 
substantially uniform thickness between two sheets of glass and laminating 
the sandwiched assembly in an autoclave. In a conventional HUD where the 
image source is located away from the windshield, the light from the image 
source reflects off the windshield toward the viewer who sees the image 
floating in space beyond the windshield. If a conventional windshield is 
used, the viewer sees two separated images, one from the front surface of the 
windshield and one from the back surface. These ghost images interfere 
with acceptable viewing. Approaches to reduce the ghost image problem include use of 
an adhesive interlayer disposed within the windshield with the interlayer 
having a predetermined wedge angle. The wedge angle is selected pursuant 
to the anticipated installation angle of the windshield, thickness of the glass 
sheets, and angle of incidence of the projected image so as to substantially 
superimpose the reflected images generated from a dashboard display 
device and reflected from the inboard surface and outboard surface of the 
windshield into a substantially singular image in the eyes of the vehicle 
operator. Among the approaches are those disclosed in US Patent 5,013,134 
and Published PCT Application WO 91/06031.  
 The wedge angle for such devices is established by using an 
adhesive sheet having a wedge-shaped thickness profile extending 
continuously across the width from edge to edge of the sheet. Such a sheet 
and a process for preparing the sheet is disclosed in US Patent 5,087,502. Web handling problems are encountered in manufacturing 
and transporting webs having a wedge-shaped thickness profile extending 
continuously across the width of the sheet. Web walking and telescoping of 
the wound up web occur damaging the web and rendering it unusable in 
preparing windshields. These problems also limits "off-line" tinting of the 
web. While special web handling equipment and procedures can be

<CLAIMS>
A continuous web of self-supporting adhesive sheet material 
for making a transparent adhesive interlayer (16) for laminated windows 

comprising a continuous web (10) of said sheet characterized by further 
having a uniform thickness profile across at least 20% of the area of the web 

extending inwardly from each edge of the web (A, B) and a wedge-shaped 
thickness profile decreasing in thickness from the area of uniform thickness 

to the center of the web. 
The continuous web of self-supporting adhesive sheet 
material of claim 1 wherein said material is polyvinyl butyral. 
The continuous web of self-supporting adhesive sheet 
material of claim 2 wherein said wedge-shaped thickness profile (C, D) has a 

wedge angle from 0.1 to 1.0 milliradians. 
The continuous web of self-supporting adhesive sheet 
material of claim 2 wherein said uniform thickness (A, B) is from 380 to 

2286 micrometers, said sheeting having a gradated shade band in the area of 
uniform thickness.

comprising outboard (12) and inboard (14) sheets of glass having a 

transparent adhesive interlayer (16) sandwiched therebetween,
 
   characterized in that said interlayer (16) has a uniform thickness profile 

(18, 20) across at least 20% of the area beginning at a top edge of said 
interlayer and extending to an image area for said display, and has a 

predetermined wedge-shaped thickness profile (20, 22) extending through 
the image area to the bottom edge of said interlayer. 
The windshield of claim 5 wherein said interlayer (16) is 
polyvinyl butyral. 
The windshield of claim 6 wherein said wedge-shaped 
thickness profile (22, 22) has a wedge angle from 0.1 to 1.0 milliradians. 
A process for preparing transparent adhesive interlayers 
(16), the process comprising the steps of:

adjustable extrusion die to provide a web of adhesive sheeting 

material (10);  
 
(b) quenching the web (10); 
 
   characterized by further comprising the steps of: 


(c) slitting said web (10) along its mid-point: and 
(d) winding said slit web onto separate rolls, and wherein said die 
provides a continuous web of self-supporting-material having a uniform 

thickness profile across at least 20% of the area of the web extending 
inwardly from each edge of the web and a wedge-shaped thickness profile 

decreasing in thickness from the area of uniform thickness to the center of 
said web.
