<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an air-mattress (10), comprising a flexible envelope in which a multiplicity of compressed-air cells (11) lying one beside the other are provided. The compressed-air cells (11) are interconnected by a channel system (12) provided in the envelope between the compressed-air cells (11), and the envelope is penetrated perpendicularly to the channel system (12) by a multiplicity of apertures (17) which do not influence the compressed-air cells (11).

Air-mattress core comprising a resilient envelope, in
which a plurality of adjacent compressed-air cells

(11) interconnected by a channel system (12) are
provided, the mattress core (1) being dividable into a

plurality of regions (13, 14) and the individual
region
s (13, 14) of the mattress core (1) being
adjustable by being filled to a differing degree,

characterized in that each region (13, 14) is divided
in a self-contained manner, the compressed-air cells

(11) being formed as adjacent individual elements by
means of concertina walls for vertical individual

height variation, and that the envelope is penetrated
at right angles to the channel system (12) by a

plurality of through-openings (17) which do not
influence the compressed-air cells (11).
Air-mattress core according to claim 1, characterized
in that the individual regions (13, 14) of the

mattress core are connected by external bypass lines
(15) provided with valves (16).
Air-mattress core according to claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that the compressed-air cells (11)

comprise a plurality of heightwise subdivided
chambers, and that the chambers of identical plane are

interconnected by separate channel systems within the
regions.
Air-mattress core according to one of claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the compressed-air cells are

designed so as to differ in height, in particular so
as to differ in regions.
Air-mattress core according to one of claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the resilient envelope is made

of a rubber material. 
Air-mattress core according to one of claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the resilient envelope is made

of a plastic material.
