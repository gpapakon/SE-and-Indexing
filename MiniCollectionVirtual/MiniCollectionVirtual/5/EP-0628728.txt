<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a multiflow diffuser/splitter for a turbojet, the latter comprising, in succession, along its longitudinal axis of symmetry, a compressor formed of impellers (moving) and fixed guide vanes, and an annular double head combustion chamber between which are interposed a diffuser (2), and an annular flow splitter (3) placed between the inner and outer shrouds (2i, 2e) of the diffuser and fixed to these by radial structural arms (4, 40). The last guide vane (54) leaving the compressor is incorporated into the structural arms (4, 40) of the diffuser/splitter (2, 3) shaped like guide vanes.

<CLAIMS>
A turbojet engine comprising in succession along its
longitudin
al axis of symmetry a compressor (1) consisting of
rotor stages (1a) and fixed straightening vane stages, an

annular twin-headed combustion chamber (6) and, in between, a
diffuser (52) and an annular flow separator (3) disposed

between the inner casing (2i) and the outer casing (2e) of the
diffuser, the separator (3) being secured to the casings by

radial structural arms (4, 40) and having two radially spaced-apart
walls (3b, 3c) at its downstream end, characterised in

that the final straightening stage (54) at the outlet of the
compressor (1) is integral with the diffuser-separator (52, 3,

4, 40), the vanes (54) of the final straightening stage being
in direct mechanical continuity with the separator arms, (4,

40).
A turbojet engine according to claim 1,

characterised in that the vanes of the final straightening
stage start upstream of the separator (3; 3b, 3c) and are

prolonged downstream to form the structural arms (4, 40).
A turbojet engine according to claim 2,

characterised in that additional structural arms (4a, 40a) are
provided between the straightening vanes formed by the

structural arms (4, 40) and are also shaped like straightening
vanes but start and end with the separator axially of the

engine.
A turbojet engine according to any of claims 1 to 3,

characterised in that the separator (3) is designed to divide
the incident flow into two flows, namely an external flow and

an internal flow (Fe, Fi).
A turbojet engine according to any of claims 1 to 3,

characterised in that the separator (3b, 3c) is designed to 
divide the incident flow into three flows, namely an external

flow, an intermediate flow and an internal flow (Fe, Fc, Fi).
A turbojet engine according to any of claims 1 to
5, characterised in that the diffuser-separator has means for

bleeding air to outside the jet engine.
A turbojet engine according to any of claims 1 to
6, characterised in that the diffuser-separator is embodied as

a unitary moulding.
A turbojet engine according to any of claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that the diffuser-separator is made by

machine welding or machine brazing.
