<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a method of isolating portions of integrated 
circuits which permits closely packed structures. A 

semiconductor wafer is provided with a substrate (11) of 
one conductivity type, a first layer (12) of opposite conductivity 

type and high impurity concentration formed 
thereon, and a second layer (13) of either conductivity 

type but lower concentration formed over the first layer. 
The major surfaces of the semiconductor layers are parallel 

to the (110) plane. Narrow grooves (15) with sidewalls in 
the (111) plane are etched into the first layer. A shallow 

diffusion (16) of impurities of the same conductivity type 
as the first layer is performed in the sidewalls and bottom of 

the grooves which permits the first layer to be contacted 

from the surface of the second layer. The groove is then 
etched further until it extends into the underlying substrate. 

Impurities of the same conductivity type as the substrate 
are diffused into the bottom and sidewalls of the grooves 

(17). The concentration of these impurities is chosen so 
that a chanstop region is formed in the substrate without 

appreciably affecting electrical conductivity between the 
first layer and the regions formed by the previous diffusion.
