<ABSTRACT>
Known locks for a secondary leaf of fire doors comprise 
a pair of rods which slide vertically, in opposite 

directions, between an extracted closing position and a 
retracted opening position, and which at their ends engage 

corresponding seats provided respectively in a door frame 
and in a floor, a first upper (8) and a second lower slide (9) which 

can be connected to the rods and guided in a sliding manner 
vertically in a casing (1) of the lock against respective return 

spring means (10) between a position of reciprocal withdrawal and 
a position of approach, corresponding respectively to the 

closing and the opening positions of the rods, a rocker 
return device (12) pivoted centrally on
 a first pivot (13) in the 
casing (1) and having at opposite ends pin articulation grooves (14) 

into which project pins (15) from the slides (8,9), for transmission of 
movement from the first slide (8) to the second slide (9), a second 

pivot (5) on the casing (1) on which an activating lever (4) pivots to 
act on the first slide (8) against second return spring means (7), 

such as to give rise to movement of the slides (8,9) into the 
position of reciprocal approach. In the present invention 

the first slide (8) is provided with an opening through which a 
projection (15) on the casing (1) extends, thus providing a further 

point of connection between the sides of the casing (1) and a 
guide for the slide (8) at an intermediate point along the 

length of the slide (8).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concems a lock for the secondary leaf of fire doors.So-called fire doors of the two-leaf type are currently known, which are used for reasons of safety in public premises and the like. The secondary leaf of these fire doors is generally provided with a locking device which normally attaches it to the frame. In particular, this locking device usually consists of a lock which is provided with a pair of rods which slide vertically, in opposite directions, in the leaf, such that they can engage in ferrules in corresponding seats provided respectively in the door frame and in the floor. In use, when they are in a position retracted inside the leaf, the said rods enable the door to be opened fully, whereas in the extended position they lock the secondary leaf.The rods in question are generally slid into the extended leaf-locking position by means of a mechanism which is actuated manually by a lever or handle. The said mechanism is fitted in a seat provided in the profile of the secondary leaf. In the event of activation by means of a lever, the latter is accessible after the main leaf has been opened; in this case the activating lever is disposed in a housing which is delimited by the mechanism casing.With particular reference to locks which are activated by means of a lever, and which specifically are used in fire doors, the said activating lever usually has a pair of transverse pins by means of which it engages the locking rods, such as to enable them to be moved into the said extended locking position and the retracted release position. Essentially, the leaf is both released and locked manually, by rotating the activating lever angularly, for example by an angle of 180Â°.Locks of this type nevertheless have some disadvantages of both a structural and functional nature, which restrict optimum use thereof. In fact these locks generally have relatively high production costs, as well as dimensions which are often large. In addition, manual closing of the leaf constitutes an obvious limitation in the use of fire doors.In addition, complaints have been made that the leaves of fire doors are not sufficiently secure as far as potential attempted break-ins are concerned.German Utility Model No G 87 01 630.3 in the name of BKS GmbH describes and claims a lock for a secondary leaf of fire doors which comprises a pair of rods which slide vertically, in opposite directions, between an extended locking position and a retracted release position, and which at their ends engage corresponding seats

<CLAIMS>
A lock for mounting within a recess in the narrow closing face of a secondary leaf of fire doors, which lock defines an aperture in that face capable of receiving and permitting access to an activating lever (4) and serving as a strike and comprises a pair of rods which slide vertically, in opposite directions, between an extended locking position and a retracted release position, and which at their ends engage corresponding seats provided respectively in a door frame and in a floor, a first upper and a second lower slide (8, 9) connected to the rods and guided in a sliding manner vertically in a casing (1) of the lock against respective return spring means (10) between a position of reciprocal withdrawal and a position of approach, corresponding respectively to the locking and the release positions of the rods, a rocker return device (12) pivoted centrally on a first pivot (13) in the casing and having at opposite ends pin coupling grooves (14) into which project pins (15) from the slides, for transmission of movement from the first slide (8) to the second slide (9), a second pivot (5) on the casing on which the activating lever (4) pivots to act on the first slide (8) against second return spring means (7), such as to give rise to movement of the slides into the position of reciprocal approach, 
characterised in that
 the first slide (8) is provided with an opening (23) through which a projection (22) on the casing extends; and wherein the activating lever (4) has a first major shank and a minor shank to form a substantially L-shape, and wherein a gripper portion (6) is formed on an end of the minor shank remote from the major shank, and wherein the major shank, the minor shank and the gripper portion (6) together form a concave region of the activating lever (4), which concave region serves as an extraction means for enabling the activating lever (4) to be extracted from its seat within the aperture (3).
A lock according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 on its top the activating lever (4) has a tooth (18) with a suitably rounded profile, which during the opening stage can abut a roller pin (19) which projects transversely from the first slide (8).
A lock according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 in the position of the coupling groove (14) on the second lower side the rocker return device (12) has
 a flattened portion which enables the second lower slide (9) to slide upwards independently of the first upper slide (8).
A lock according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the slides (8, 9) are advantageously made of flattened metal elements which are disposed such as to be coplanar on the vertical sliding plane.
A lock according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the transmission pins (15) of the rocker return device (12) move along slots (16) provided vertically in the casing (1).
