<ABSTRACT>
Process for the treatment of a waste liquor produced in the agri-foodstuffs industry, containing both inorganic salts consisting predominantly of potassium sulphate, and organic matter, so as to obtain, on the one hand, a solid fraction consisting chiefly of inorganic salts and, on the other hand, a concentrate of organic matter with a low potassium content, the waste liquor to be treated feeding a plant comprising at least two concentration stages (21, 22) in series and at least two separators, the first separator (41) being fed by the last concentration stage (22) and producing the concentrate of organic matter, and the second separator (29) being fed by any concentration stage (21) other than the last stage and producing the inorganic salts, into which sulphuric acid and an aqueous solution of ammonium sulphate are introduced into the treated liquid stream so as to make the pH in the concentration stage (21) feeding the second separator (29) between 3.5 and 5.5.

Process for treating a waste liquid produced in
the agrifood industry, containing both inorganic salts,

consisting mostly of potassium sulphate, and organic
matter, so as to obtain, on the one hand, a solid

fraction consisting mainly of inorganic salts, and, on
the other hand, an organic matter concentrate with a

low potassium content, the waste liquid to be treated
being fed into an installation including at least two

concentration stages (1, 2; 21, 22; 52, 62, 85) in
series and at least two separators, the first separator

(9; 41; 102, 103) being fed by the last concentration
stage (2, 22, 85) and supplying the organic matter

concentrate, and the second separator (5, 29, 70) being
fed by any concentration stage (1, 21, 62) other than

the last stage and supplying the inorganic salts,
characterized in that sulphuric acid and an aqueous

ammonium sulphate solution are introduced into the
liquid flow treated, such that the pH in the

concentration stage (1, 21, 62) fed into the second
separator (5, 29, 70) is between 3.5 and 5.5.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the first separator (9; 41; 102, 103) supplies a

feedback flow which is returned at a point upstream of
the circulation of the treated flow and the second

separator (5, 29, 70) supplies a mother liquor which is
returned into the treated flow upstream or downstream

of the concentration stage (1, 21, 62) fed into the
second separator (5, 29, 70). 
Process according to either of Claims 1 and 2,
characterized in that the sulphuric acid and the

ammonium sulphate are introduced at the same point or
at different points in the installation, in a

continuous or batchwise manner, simultaneously or one
after the other.
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the sulphuric acid and/or the

ammonium sulphate solution are introduced into the feed
(3, 23, 50) of waste liquid, in the concentration stage

(1, 21, 62) fed into the second separator (5, 29, 70)
and/or into a concentration stage (52) located upstream

of the concentration stage (62) fed into the second
separator (70).
Process according to either of Claims 1 and 2,
characterized in that the sulphuric acid and/or the

ammonium sulphate solution are introduced into a liquid
recycled into the concentration stage (1, 21, 62) fed

into the second separator (5, 29, 70) and/or into a
concentration stage (52) located upstream.
Process according to Claim 5, characterized in
that the recycled liquid is the mother liquor obtained

(at 31, 74) after separation of the inorganic salts in
the second separator (29, 70) or the liquid obtained

(at 11) after separation of the organic matter
concentrate in the first separator (9).
Process according to Claim 5, in which at least
the last concentration stage is monitored by a selector

member, characterized in that the recycled liquid is
the liquid enriched with inorganic salts taken from the

selector member (89) located between the last
concentration stage (85) and the first separator (103)

supplying the organic matter concentrate.
Process according to Claim 5, characterized in
that the concentration stage receiving the recycled

liquid, into which the sulphuric acid and/or the
ammonium sulphate solution are introduced, consists of

an evaporator (21, 52, 62) combined with an external
recycling loop (21
b
, 54, 60), the sulphuric acid and/or 
the ammonium sulphate an
d/or the liquid containing at
least one of these compounds being introduced into the

recycling loop (21
b
, 54, 60).
Process according to Claim 5, in which a
concentration stage located downstream of the stage

(21), which feeds the second separator (29), is an
evaporator (22) including an elutriation stem (22c),

characterized in that the recycled liquid is taken from
the elutriation stem (22
c
).
Process according to Claim 2, in which the
recycled liquids are introduced into a recovery tank

(24, 75), characterized in that the sulphuric acid
and/or the ammonium sulphate solution is (are)

introduced into the said recovery tank (24, 75).
