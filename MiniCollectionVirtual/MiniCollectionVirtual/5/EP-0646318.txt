<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a process for producing an edible 
proteinaceous film which comprises kneading and melting a raw 

material containing water and protein with heating by an 
extruder (1), extruding the melted material through a die (4) 

having a circular opening (16) of the extruder, while 
providing gas of a higher pressure than the atmospheric 

pressure into the inside of a tubular extrudate (20) and 
exhausting the gas, and then taking off the tubular extrudate 

(20) by holding with a take-off means (6). An apparatus to

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for producing
an edible proteinaceous film and an apparatus
therefor. More specifically, it relates to novel improvement
in the production of tubular edible casings by using
a raw material containing water and protein.Usually, casings for food are classified into natural
and artificial casings. Natural casings are produced
from the intestines from domestic animal such as
sheep, swine, cattle and the like. On the other hand,
artificial casings include edible casings (collagen proteins)
and non-edible casings (cellulose, plastics).Since the present invention is directed to edible natural
casings, conventional processes for producing
them are described below.Natural casings are produced by removing the
intestines from an animal, removing feculence and
mucosa therefrom by washing with water and salting.As for edible casings (collagen proteins), it was said
that Karl Freudenberg Co. in Germany firstly succeeded
in the production of a thick artificial casing material by
using collagen fibers of a cattle skin in the middle of
1920's and Becker Co. marketed this material under the
trade name of "Naturin Casing". Since then such natural
casings have been produced and sold by several companies
in different countries. Among them, a typical
process is described below.According to this process, the dermis of an adult
cattle is soaked in lime, followed by deliming, pulverizing
mechanically and disentangling after being swollen well
with an acid to prepare a collagen fiber paste. On the
other hand, the purified cattle dermis is subjected to the
enzymatic decomposition with a proteolytic enzyme,
"Procuase" (Meiji Seika Co., Ltd.), to prepare an enzymatically
digested collagen. Eighty parts of the collagen
fiber paste previously prepared is mixed with 20 parts of
the enzymatically digested collagen, and the mixture is
extruded into a saturated saline solution to form a
molded material by coagulation. After coagulation, the
molded material is tanned, washed with water, soaked
in glycerin bath, and dried. After drying, the material is
folded in bellows, heated for several hours (below
100°C) and allowed to stand in a constant humidity to
obtain a casing.As described above, in the production of a conventional
tubular edible casing, a coagulant has been
always used and no proteinaceous film which is an edible
tubular casing produced from soybean protein has
been produced heretofore in the prior art.Conventional natural casings and edible casings
have following problems.As for

A process for producing an edible proteinaceous
film which comprises kneading and melting a raw

material containing water and protein with heating by
an extruder (1), extruding the melted material through

a die (4) having a circular opening (16) from the
extruder, 
characterised by
