<ABSTRACT>
Fan propeller for a circulating (recirculation) centrifugal (radial) fan of a cooking space or the like, having a number of radially arranged blades (vanes) (10) which project in a manner essentially parallel to the axis (12) of the rotation of the fan propeller, from a support disc (14) facing a housing wall of the cooking space, characterised in that at least between some of the blades (10) there are arranged near the support disc (14) but at a spacing therefrom splitters (18) whose radially outer outside edge is essentially aligned with the outer circumference of the fan propeller and whose radially inner inside edge is spaced from the axis of rotation of the fan propeller, and which respectively form together with the support disc (14) and the two respectively adjacent blades (10) a nozzle device for generating near the support disc a gas flow directed radially outwards.

A fan rotor for a circulating fan in a cooking 
compartment or the like, comprising blades (10) which 

project substantially parallel to the rotational axis 
(12) of the fan rotor from a support disc (14) facing a 

wall of the cooking compartment housing, comprising 
guide plates (18) disposed at least between some of the 

blades (10) at a distance from the support disc (14), 
the radially outer outside edge of the guide blades 

being substantially in alignment with the outer 
periphery of the fan rotor, their radially inner inside 

edge being spaced from the rotational axis (12) of the 
fan rotor, characterised in that the guide blades (18) 

together with the support disc (14) and the respective 
neighbouring radially disposed blades (10) which extend 

straight, respectively form a nozzle device to produce 
a radially outwardly directed gas flow near the support 

disc (14). 
A fan rotor according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the guide plates (18) are provided between all the 

blade pairs (10). 
A fan rotor according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the radial side edges of the 

guide plates (18) are fixed on the respective 
neighbouring two blades (10). 
A fan rotor according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the guide plates (18) are 

constructed so as to be inclined in the direction of 
the support disc (14) from their inside edge to their 

outside edge.
