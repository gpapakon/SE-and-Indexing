<ABSTRACT>
A reversible check valve cartridge wherein a sealing disc 
(5) is urged to the shutoff position by means of a cage 

mounted umbrella spoke-like spring (14, 15) which is 
secured to the cage (10) and is fully recessable therein so 

as to permit full travel of the sealing disc within the 
cage, thereby permitting increased flow for a given 

thickness of the valve cartridge.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to check valves and more 
particularly to a spring check valve cartridge for use with 
diaphragm pumps and the like and more particularly where a 
compact reversible flat check valve requiring minimal depth 
is desired. Pumps using check valves to control flow through the pump 
generally rely on gravity for the checks to function 
particularly when there is no fluid in the pump. The type of checks used are either a ball or a flat/disc 
type. They allow flow in one direction and prevent flow in 
the opposite direction. In a typical pump there are two 
checks, one on the pump inlet and one at the outlet. The 
inlet check allows fluid to enter the pump when a vacuum is 
pulled in the pumping chamber. At the same time the outlet 
check is closed preventing fluid or gases to enter the 
pumping chamber during the suction cycle. When the pump 
expels the fluid, the inlet check closes due to gravity and 
frictional drag between the check and the fluid being 
pumped. The outlet check is forced open due to pressure 
acting on the check which was generated in the pumping 
chamber. The cycle begins again at the end of the pumping 
stroke. For this type of pump to self prime, the pump must 
be orientated such that gravity will cause the checks to 
seat properly. One known method used to overcome this limitation is to use 
a mechanical spring physically to force the check against 
the seat. The arrangement works well in most cases; 
however, the spring is subject to fatigue failure if the 
pump operates at high cycle rates. Full flow rate is also 
reduced because the spring limits the check lift. The  
 
volume occupied by the spring loaded check is larger. Free 
springs may cause problems during assembly and the added 
volume of the check reduces the pumps' volumetric 
efficiency and increase the net positive suction head 
required for the pump to begin to operate. The check valve feels only the difference between suction 
pressure and the pressure in the fluid chamber. When the 
pressure differential is sufficient to lift the check from 
its seat, the valve will being to open. The rate of 
pressure drop when the pump piston or diaphragm creates a 
vacuum is a function of the volume ratio and the vapour 
pressure of the fluid pumped. Loading the check with a 
spring requires the pump to generate higher suction 
pressure in the pumping chamber to open the check. Metallic springs cannot be used in environments where 
chemical compatibility between the spring and the process 
fluid will
