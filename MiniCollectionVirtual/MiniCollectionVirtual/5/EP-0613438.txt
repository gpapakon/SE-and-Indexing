<ABSTRACT>
A method and a system for connecting a submerged loading/unloading buoy (2) to a submerged receiving space (3) in a floating vessel (1), for transfer of a medium, especially oil, to or from the vessel, wherein the buoy (2) is anchored to the sea bed (4) and is connected to a transfer line (6) for medium. According to one variant of the method, a sink line (16) is lowered from the vessel (1) through the receiving space (3), an auxiliairy buoy (18) being attached to the sink line end, possibly via an additional line (19), and the auxiliary buoy (18) being caused to come to the water surface. A suitably marked pick-up line (12), which is connected to the buoy (2), is taken up and connected to the sink line, whereafter the vessel (1) by a positioning means is moved into position above the submerged buoy (2) and said lines (16, 12) are pulled up through the receiving space (3), so that the buoy (2) is hoisted up and moved to a locking position therein, whereafter the buoy is locked in place in the receiving space. The vessel is provided with a hoisting means (11) to hoist up said lines and the buoy (2), and also with a service shaft (9) connecting the receiving space (3) to the deck (8) of the vessel.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for connecting a buoy to a 
floating vessel, for transfer of a flowable medium to or from the 
vessel, wherein the vessel is brought into position above a 
submerged loading/unloading buoy which is anchored to the sea bed 
and is connected to at least one transfer line for medium, and 
a hoisting means on the vessel is connected to the buoy whereafter 
it is hoisted up and inserted into a downwardly open 
submerged receiving space in the vessel. Further, the invention relates to a system for connecting 
a buoy to a floating vessel, for transfer of a flowable 
medium to or from the vessel, comprising a submerged loading/unloading 
buoy which is anchored to the sea bed via catenary 
mooring lines and is connected to at least one transfer line for 
medium, a downwardly open submerged receiving space arranged on 
the vessel for receipt of the buoy, and a hoisting means arranged 
on the vessel for connection with and hoisting of the buoy, so 
that it is inserted into the receiving space. A method and a system of the above-mentioned type are 
known from e.g. US patent specification No. 4 604 961 (corresponds 
to Norwegian patent specification No. 167 906). This known 
system is based on a vessel having a through-going deck opening 
in a central region of the vessel, the lower part of the through 
opening forming the submerged receiving space for a mooring 
element in the form of a submerged buoy. In the receiving space 
there is arranged a rotating body (turret) which is rotatably 
mounted in the hull of the vessel and is designed for receipt and 
attachment of the mooring element, the latter to this end being 
provided with a hydraulically actuated locking mechanism for 
attachment to the rotating body. Further, the vessel is provided 
with a derrick for the lowering of a retrieval string having a 
retrieval connector at its lower end for interconnection with the 
mooring element, so that this may be pulled up and into the 
receiving space. The interconnection is obtained in that the 
mooring element is provided with a conical centering receptacle 
having a socket arranged at the bottom wherein the retrieval 
connector may be received and secured, e.g. by means of a bayonet  
 
lock. The lower end of the retrieval string preferably is 
provided with sonar and TV equipment to ensure positioning of the 
retrieval connector in the centering receptacle. The known system is encumbered with some drawbacks 
which will be discussed below. As mentioned, the vessel of the known system
