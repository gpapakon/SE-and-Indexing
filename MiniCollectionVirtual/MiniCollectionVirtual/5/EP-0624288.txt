<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to temperature 
compensation circuits, and more specifically to a crystal reference 
temperature compensation circuit. Crystal oscillator circuits vary in output frequency due to 
variations in the resonant frequency of the circuit's crystal 
reference element. These variations to the crystal element are 
typically caused by changes in temperature which affect the 
crystal elements resonant frequency. A few techniques which are 
used in the art for compensating for these crystal variations 
include: using crystals having good temperature characteristics; 
using crystal ovens to maintain the crystal's temperature at a 
substantially constant temperature; and characterizing the crystal 
over temperature and compensating for these characterized 
variations by providing a compensation signal to the oscillator 
circuit which attempts to offset the variations in the crystal, such as 
discussed in U.S. Patent 4, 967, 165 by Lee et al. The major problem with using high quality (e.g, minimal 
temperature variation crystals) crystals as described above is that 
high quality crystals tend to be very expensive and still tend to 
vary a substantial amount over temperature. The use of crystal 
ovens are not only expensive since they require quite a bit of 
parts to implement, but they also tend to be impractical for battery 
powered applications due to their high current drain. Known 
compensation techniques that compensate for characterized 
crystal variations do not provide the frequency stability required 
for modern communication equipment having high specifications.  
 
Present day frequency synthesizers normally utilize varactors to vary the resonant 
frequency of the crystal oscillator in order to change the phase-locked-loop (PLL) 
output frequency. Voltage curves corresponding to different temperatures are also 
typically programmed over the operating temperature range of the synthesizer into 
the PLL. The programming, in turn, sets current sources which are enabled at 
certain temperatures and drive the oscillator varactor differently over temperature in 
order to compensate the circuit for changes in temperature. The problem with the 
above compensation scheme is that the synthesizer requires the use of a varactor to 
adjust the oscillator's frequency. The varactor not only adds additional cost to the 
circuit but also adds it's own tolerances to the final generated frequency. A need thus exists in the art for a way of eliminating the use of tight 
temperature

A method for temperature compensating a crystal oscillator circuit (146) which 
provides a reference signal to a digital synthesizer (148), the digital synthesizer 

providing an output signal (130) having a predetermined frequency that is 
substantially constant over changes in temperature, comprising the steps of: 


(a) determining the temperature (150) of the crystal oscillator circuit; 
(b) selecting a phase increment value corresponding to the temperature that has 
been determined; 
(c) periodically accumulating the phase increment value (152) with previous 
phase increment values to compute an instantaneous phase value; 
(d) in a look-up table (118), determining a sine wave bit stream in response to 
the instantaneous phase value; and 
(e) converting the sine wave bit stream to the output signal. 
The method for temperature compensating the crystal oscillator circuit of claim 
1, comprising the further steps of: 


characterizing the crystal oscillator circuit over temperature in order to determine 
the crystal oscillator circuit's change in reference signal frequency over a given 

temperature range; 
calculating phase increment values for generating the output signal at different 
temperatures in the temperature range given the crystal oscillator circuit's 

change in reference signal frequency over the given temperature range; and 
storing the phase increment values in a storage means (120). 
The method for temperature compensating a crystal oscillator circuit of claim 
2, wherein the step of selecting the phase increment value comprises comparing 

the determined temperature of the crystal oscillator to the phase increment  
 

values stored in the storage means and selecting the phase increment value 
corresponding to the determined temperature.
