<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a capacitive pressure transducer 
structure and a method for manufacturing the same. The 

transducer structure comprises a contiguous diaphragm 
structure (2), which at least in some parts is conducting to 

the end of forming a first electrode (4) of a transducing 
capacitor, a substrate (3) which is permanently bonded to a 

first surface of said diaphragm structure (2) and comprises 
a second electrode (5) of said transducing capacitor, 

spaced at a distance from and aligned essentially at said 
first electrode (4), and a silicon structure (1), which is 

permanently bonded to a second surface of said diaphragm 
structure (2), incorporating a space (21) suited to 

accommodate the deflection of said first electrode (4). 
According to the invention, the angle α formed between 

vertical walls (11) of said space (21) and said first 
electrode (4) is smaller than or equal to 90°, and the 

material surrounding said space (21) is silicon or doped 
silicon.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a capacitive pressure transducer structure according 
to the preamble of claim 1. The invention also concerns a method for manufacturing said capacitive pressure 
transducer structure. With regard to the prior art, reference is made to the following publications: 
   US patents 
[1] U.S. Pat. No. 4,386,453 (Gianchino et al.) [2] U.S. Pat. No. 4,257,274 (Shimada et al.) [3] U.S. Pat. No. 4,332,000 (Petersen) [4] U.S. Pat. No. 4,390,925 (Freud) [5] U.S. Pat. No. 3,397,278 (Pomeranz) [6] U.S. Pat. No. 4,589,054 (Kuisma) [7] U.S. Pat. No. 4,628,403 (Kuisma) [8] U.S. Pat. No. 4,594,639 (Kuisma) [9] U.S. Pat. No. 3,288,656 (Nakamura) Cited publications [1]-[5] are related to a capacitive pressure transducer structure in 
which a silicon diaphragm acting as a moving first electrode flexes toward a second, 
fixed metal electrode so as to permit the electrodes approach to each other with 
increasing pressure. The distance between the electrodes is a function of the imposed 
pressure. Cited publications [6], [7] and [8] disclose a capacitive pressure transducer 
structure in which the silicon diaphragm acting as the first electrode flexes away 
from the fixed metal electrode with increasing pressure. Cited publication [9] 
describes first time in the art a method for interbonding two silicon wafers using a 
technique called fusion bonding.  
 Prior-art capacitive pressure transducer structures based on arranging the electrodes to 
be closest to each other at the lowest pressure are disclosed in cited publications [6], 
[7] and [8]. Such a pressure transducer structure has a very wide operating pressure 
range. The capacitance rate-of-change with respect to pressure in the transducer 
structure is highest at low pressures when the electrodes are very close to each other, 
thus making the pressure measurement extremely accurate also at low pressures. 
Owing to the use of a vacuum chamber in the structure, no via holes for the 
conductors are required which helps attaining a stable vacuum. The vacuum chamber 
is sealed by a glass plate or silicon wafer coated with a glass layer. The first 
electrode of the transducer capacitor is thus formed by the smaller-area end of the 
conical vacuum chamber. Consequently, the conical vacuum chamber widens outward 
from the transducer diaphragm. Disadvantages of the prior-art technology structures are: 
1. Owing to the different coefficients of thermal expansion in silicon and glass, the 
flexible diaphragm is subjected to stresses which result
