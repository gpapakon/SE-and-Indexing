<ABSTRACT>
A space-efficient heating and air conditioning module for a motor vehicle includes radially inwardly directed air handling ducts (12, 14) and a coaxial rotary blower, evaporator, and heater core. A defrost supply duct (38) communicates heated or conditioned air above the evaporator (18) and heater core (24) in a direction 180 DEG  from the direction of air flow through the rotary blower (16), evaporator (18), and heater core (24). The air flow is automatically thermally stratified, to provide the warmest air to the floor vent. The module is compact, and is centrally mountable for use in left- or right-hand drive vehicles.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a space-efficient
air conditioning/heating module. More particularly, the
present invention contemplates an air conditioning/heating
module which is compact, and may be placed entirely within
the central portion of a left- or right-hand drive vehicle
dashboard.Vehicle air conditioning/heating systems are well-known
in the prior art, and typically comprise an assemblage of
heat exchangers, blowers, temperature sensors, air flow
diversion mechanisms, refrigerant flow conduits,
controllers, etc. These system elements are generally
installed at various locations throughout the vehicle engine
compartment and dashboard, and are interconnected via air
handling ducts.In EP-A- 0 458 705 there is disclosed a core case for
housing a heater core and a distribution case communicating
with the core case. The distribution case is formed with a
vent duct connecting port connectable to a vent duct
previously fixed to an instrument panel, a defroster duct
connecting port connectable to a defroster duct also
previously fixed to the instrument panel and a guide duct
connectable to a side vent duct extending to the driver seat
side and fixed to the vehicle body.The prior art systems for ducting heated and
conditioned air to the vehicle interior require large
amounts of space to accommodate the above-mentioned system
elements. The packaging requirements for climate control
systems for vehicles are becoming more important due to the
downsizing and weight-reducing programs for modern vehicles.
Furthermore, efforts are being directed toward conserving
space and weight in all areas of the climate control system.
Moreover, manufacturing costs are always an important issue,
and the utilisation of modular, space-efficient system
components will result in an overall reduction in the cost
of manufacturing a motor vehicle. It would be desirable to produce a space-efficient air
conditioning/heating module which could be installed
entirely within the dashboard of a vehicle and which could
be centre-mounted and therefore useful for both left-hand
and right-hand drive vehicles.According to the present invention, there is provided a
heating and air conditioning module as hereinafter set forth
in the appended Claim 1.The air conditioning/heating module embodying the
present invention is centre-mountable within the dashboard
of a vehicle. This air conditioning/heating module can
support future styling trend modifications, and can satisfy
more demanding customer comfort requirements. The air

<CLAIMS>
A heating and air conditioning module, comprising:

A) a plurality of radially inwardly directed air handling ducts (12,14) for
selectively receiving a singular or combined flow of air into the module;
B) a rotary air blower (16) adapted to receive the radially inward flow of air from
said air handling ducts and discharge the air in a direction coaxial with the axis of rotation of

said rotary air blower;
C) an evaporator (18) for receiving the flow therethrough of air from the rotary
air blower (16) in a direction substantially normal to a face of said evaporator (18), said

evaporator (18) adapted to circulate therethrough a quantity of refrigerant for cooling the air
flowing therethrough;
D) a heating element (24) spaced-apart from, and tilted slightly from a position
parallel to, the evaporator (18), for receiving the flow therethrough of air from said

evaporator in a direction substantially normal to a face of said heating element, said heating
element (24) adapted to thermally stratify the air flowing therethrough, the face of said

heating element (24) being substantially equal in area to the face of said evaporator (18);
E) means (28,30,32,34,36) for selectively distributing the flow of air from the
heating element (24) to any one or a combination of ducts (38,40,42), said distributing means

adapted to provide the thermally stratified warmer air from said heating element to the floor
duct; and
F) a defrost supply duct (38) for receiving a flow therethrough of air from said
distributing means, for communicating the flow of air above the evaporator and heating

element in a direction substantially 180Â° from the direction of flow of air through said rotary
blower, evaporator, and heating element.
A heating and air conditioning module according to Claim 1, wherein the
radially inwardly directed air handling ducts (12,14) comprise an outside air duct (12) and a

recirculating air duct (14). 
A heating and air conditioning module according to Claim 1, wherein the
space between the evaporator (18) and the heating element (24) is sufficient to substantially

prevent rehumidification of the air entering said heater core.
A heating and air conditioning module as claimed in any preceding claim,
wherein said heater element (24) is a heater core adapted to circulate therethrough a quantity

of engine coolant for heating the air flowing therethrough, and adapted to receive the engine
coolant at the bottom of said heater core and to discharge the engine coolant at the top of said

heater core to thermally stratify the air flowing therethrough.
A motor vehicle having a heating and air conditioning module as claimed in
any preceding claim fitted centrally within the dashboard of the vehicle.
