<ABSTRACT>
Alkylsilyl nitrile is prepared by anhydrously 
reacting stoichiometric amounts of alkylsilyl 

halide, alkyldisilazane or alkylsilyl amine, and 
hydrogen cyanide, in the absence or presence of a 

solvent or inert gas atmosphere. No catalyst is 
necessary, and the reaction preferably is performed at 

a temperature of from 5°C to 25°C.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the preparation of trialkylsilyl
nitrile (also known as trialkylsilyl cyanide and
cyanotrialkylsilane). Trialkylsilyl nitriles, especially
trimethylsilyl nitrile, are used to form silylated cyanohydrins
from ketones or aldehydes, to conjugatively add cyanide to
enones, to form acylnitriles from acylchlorides, to protect
ketones, to add to imines to form '-amino nitriles, and to add to
oximes to give '-cyano oximes. Trialkylsilyl nitrile will lead
to cycloadducts upon reaction with carbodiimides, diimines,
isocyanates and isothiocyanates and nitriles. Further,
trialkylsilyl nitrile adds to acetylenes, allenes and nitrones
and opens oxiranes and oxetanes. It also serves as a source of
cyanide ion in various nucleophilic substitutions, both organic
and inorganic. Trimethylsilyl nitrile has been described as one
of the most versatile silicon reagents for the purposes of
organic synthesis. J.K. Rasmussen, S.M. Heilmann, L.R. Krepski,
"The Chemistry of Cyanotrimethylsilane", in Advances in Silicon
Chemistry (Ed. G.L. Larson), Vol. 1, 66 (1991).Trialkylsilyl nitrile has been prepared for several years by
reaction of the iodosilane (R)3SiI with silver cyanide according
to the reaction
 
Trimethylsilyl nitrile has also been obtained from the
corresponding sulfide, bromide and chloride. W.C. Groutas,
D. Felker, "Synthetic Application of Cyanotrimethylsilane, Iodo
trimethylsilane, Azidotrimethylsilane, and Methylthiotrimethylsilane",
Synthesis, Nov., 861 (1980), report obtaining
an 80% yield through reaction of silver cyanide with
chlorotrimethylsilane. Despite the obvious expense of silver
cyanide, it was the reagent of choice for the preparation of
trialkylsilyl nitriles for several years. Rasmussen et al. at
68.Trialkylsilyl nitrile has also been obtained in moderate
yields through reaction of chlorotrimethylsilane with potassium
mercuricyanide in DMF, reaction of hexamethyldisilazane with
hydrogen cyanide, reaction of methoxytriethysilane with
pivaloylcyanide in the presence of aluminum chloride, and from
cyanide exchange between chlorotriphenysilane and
cyanotriethylsilane. Rasmussen et al. at 68-69. The reaction of
hexamethyldisilazane with hydrogen cyanide was published by
DuPont workers in 1958 in J.Amer.Chem.Soc., 80, 4151-4153 (1958).
The DuPont workers disclose a yield of 36.7% trimethylsilyl
nitrile and 45% ammonium cyanide. The ammonium cyanide is a
nitrile salt and is as such very difficult to handle.Trimethylsilyl nitrile has been prepared by reacting a
diethyl ether
