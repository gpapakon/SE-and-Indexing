<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a digital phase comparator supplying digital values (E) corresponding to the phase differences between a first signal (F) having a duty cycle close to 0.5 and a second signal (Fref). According to the invention, the comparator comprises a one-way counter (30) initialised at the frequency of the first signal and clocked by a clock signal (CK), the frequency of which is high with respect to that of the first and second signals. A logic gate (32) enables the counter when the first and second signals are in predetermined respective states. A phase difference is considered to be zero when it corresponds approximately to half of the capacity of the counter.

A digital phase comparator supplying digital
values (E) corresponding to the phase shifts between a

first signal (F) and a second signal (Fref), including a
one-way counter (30) initialized at the frequency of the

first signal and clocked by a clock signal (CK) having a
high frequency with respect to the frequency of the first

and second signals, and a logic gate (32) for enabling
the counter; characterized in that the first signal has a

duty cycle of substantially 0.5 and in that the logic
gate (32) is connected to enable the counter when the

first and second signals are in respective predetermined
states, a phase shift being considered as zero when it

corresponds to one half of the counter's capacity.
The phase comparator of claim 1, including a flip-flop
(34) cooperating with said logic gate (32) to enable

the counter (30) only when a predetermined edge of the
second signal (Fref) occurs when the first signal (F) is

at its respective predetermined state.
The phase comparator of claim 2, including a processing
circuit (22) for decreasing the duration of the

respective predetermined state of the first signal (F) by
the duration corresponding to the counter (30) counting

up to half its capacity.
The phase comparator of claim 1 or 2, including a
clock generator providing a plurality of clock signals

(CK, CK2, CK3) having the same frequency but phase
shifted by a constant value, said clock signals being

successively provided to the counter at the frequency of
the first signal.
