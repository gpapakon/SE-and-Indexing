<ABSTRACT>
In a mobile system of the RTI type, that is to 
say a system of short-range communication, between a 

vehicle and the roadside, beacons or radio beacons are 
utilized. Information on traffic, for example vehicle 

traffic, is exchanged between the said beacons and the 
mobile units when the latter pass respective beacons. At 

least some of the beacons of the mobile system (1) are of 
the virtual type (VB). This means that positions (P) 

which represent the said virtual beacons (VB) are 
specified in the system, preferably in centrally placed 

elements (VB'). An alternative medium (2) cooperates in 
order to access data between a respective mobile unit 

(M2) and a respective virtual beacon (VB).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for
a mobile system, for example the RTI system which is
a system for short-range communication between a vehicle
and the roadside. The mobile system comprises mobile
units and beacons (radio beacons), by means of which
information on traffic, for example vehicle traffic, can
be executed in dependence on information transferred from
the mobile units to the said beacons, and vice versa,
when the mobile units are passing the latter.The RTI system, for example, is based on data
communication between a vehicle and the roadside. The
data communication requires a new infrastructure built
around beacons with short range.In the publication "Integrated Communication
Architecture for Road Transport Informatics, second
international conference on beacon navigation and
information systems, N Wall et al. 1991, volume 2, pages
923 - 928, ISBN: 07800304888", different ways of introducing
an RTI system by integrating existing systems, for
example RDS-TNC, GSM-based SOKRATES, beacon systems and
so forth are discussed. A virtual RTI system based on an
infrastructure with a multiplicity of communication
systems including GSM, beacons and satellites is also
briefly disclosed. However, the virtual network is only
discussed superficially.In European Patent Specification EP 172 320 913
a method for locating a mobile telephone is specified.
The fixed base stations transmit identity signals and
precise timing pulses from their fixed locations. The
signal transfer occurs either as a response to an
interrogation signal from the mobile or automatically at
predetermined time intervals. The mobile unit can utilize 
internally stored tables of positions of the fixed base
stations when calculating its own positions. The method
is intended to be used for monitoring and controlling
vehicle traffic. The method entails that high costs for
setting up a new fixed infrastructure for traffic monitoring
can be avoided.European Patent Specification 242,099 describes
a method for locating a vehicle, for example in the case
of the theft of a car. A unit in the vehicle calculates
the position of the vehicle with the aid of a GPS system.
This position is transmitted to a central monitoring
station via a mobile telephone system if a break-in is
detected or if a change in position is detected.American Patent Specification US 5,043,736
discloses a cellular locating system. The system consists
of a portable locating unit which can be used both as
mobile telephone and for global positioning. The unit has

</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method for communicating within the coverage area (1) of an RTI system,
between a mobile unit (M1, M2) comprised in a vehicle, and a stationary element

(RB) placed at a position on the roadside, the mobile unit exchanging road and
traffic information with the stationary element when passing said position, the

method comprising the step of defining an arbitrary additional position (VB) within
said coverage area as having the desired property that, when any mobile unit (M1,

M2) passes said additional position (VB), road and traffic information transfer
between said mobile unit and the fixed part of the RTI system is initiated, this

desired property being obtained by the steps of:

storing a plurality of predetermined additional positions (VB), and information on
road and traffic for each of said additional positions (VB), in a central storing unit

(VB') in the RTI system;
communicating by using a mobile telephony system between the central storing
unit and a mobile unit when the mobile unit passes any one of the said

predetermined additional positions.
The method as recited in claim 1, comprising the steps of:

communicating information between mobile units (M1, M2) and the central
storing unit (VB') via the mobile telephony system at less traffic- or use-intensive

areas of a total coverage area of the RTI system and, when traffic or use of the
system increases,
placing out a new stationary element (RB) at the stored additional position (VB) of
the area with increased traffic or use;
downloading, from the central storing unit (VB'), the stored information for said
additional position (VB) into said new stationary element (RB);
communicating information between mobiles and the new stationary element at
the position of said new stationary element.
The method as recited in any of the preceding claims, comprising the step of
selecting such additional positions as covered by the RTI system in areas where the

capacity utilisation of the mobile telephony system is low.
The method as recited in any of the previous claims, comprising the step of
using beacons as stationary elements (RB) in the RTI system.
The method as recited in any of the previous claims, comprising the step of
using a GSM mobile telephony system for transmitting information between mobile

units and the central storing unit in the RTI system.
