<ABSTRACT>
A composition for the inhibition of the abnormal postnatal 
axial growth of the eye of a maturing animal which comprise a 

pharmaceutically effective amount of a cholinergic agonist 
relatively selective for blocking the cholinergic receptors in 

cells of the brain, neural tissue and/or neural ganglia but less 
selective for blocking the cholinergic receptors of the cells of 

smooth muscles at the front of the eye, said agonist being 
present in a carrier or diluent suitable for ocular 

administration. A suitable agonist is pilocarpine, carbamyl 
choline chloride or an MÂ¹ muscarinic agonist McNeil-A.343.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to control of ocular development and,
more particularly, to the treatment of the eye to control the
development of myopia (commonly known as nearsightedness). This
application has been divided from European Patent Application No.
90911118.9 which describes and claims the use in the manufacture
of a composition of ocular administration for controlling the
abnormal postnatal growth of the eye of a maturing animal which
composition comprises an effective amount of a muscarinic
pharmacological agent known to be effective in brain, neural
tissue and/or neural ganglia, which agent is relatively less
selective toward the smooth muscles at the front of the eye,
characterized in that the agent is selected from pirenzepine,
telenzepine or o-methoxy-sila-hexocyclium.It has been estimated that about one of every four persons
on earth suffers from myopia. About one-half or more of these
cases are axial myopia, i.e., an elongation of the eye along the
visual axis.At birth, the human eye is about two-thirds adult size and
is even at that size relatively short in the axial direction.
As a consequence, young children tend to be farsighted. During
childhood, as the eye grows, there is a compensatory fine tuning
of the optical properties of the cornea and lens to the
increasing ocular length. Often the entire process is virtually
perfect and no correction is needed for sharp vision at distance;
the eye is emmetropic. When regulatory failure in this finely
tuned process 
occurs, it usually goes toward a lengthened eye. As a
result, distant images focus in front of the plane of the
retina and axial myopia results. If, on the other hand,
the regulatory failure leads to an eye whose ocular length
is too short, near images focus behind the plane of the
retina and the result is hyperopia (commonly known as
farsightedness).Over the years, many theories have been put forth
to explain the development of myopia, e.g., inheritance,
excessive near work, and environmental influences such as
hours of sunshine, diet, etc. From these theories many
preventative measures have been proposed including
spectacles, eye exercise, eye rest, cycloplegia, and other
drug therapies. The clinical literature on the subject is
massive.Based on a theory that substantial use of the eye
by children for reading leads to the development of
permanent nearsightedness or myopia, many remedies directed
at the focussing mechanism at the front of the eye have
been proposed. Largely these have been attempts either to
block near focus through
