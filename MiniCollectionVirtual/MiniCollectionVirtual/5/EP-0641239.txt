<ABSTRACT>
It is known to filter a suspension or emulsion in a filter bed of particulate filter medium (1) by allowing the suspension to flow upwards through the filter bed simultaneously as the medium (1) flows downwards through a filtering tank (2) wherein filtration takes place. Filtration thus takes place during counterflow between suspension and filter medium. The supply of suspension takes place in the lower part (4) of the filter bed and the filtered liquid phase is taken away from a zone (8) above the filter bed. The polluted filter medium close to the bottom of the filter tank is taken out for conveyance to a washing apparatus (13) above the filter bed and after washing is returned to the upper side of the filter bed. For providing a filter which has a considerably lower construction height than previously for a given and unchanged volume of the filter medium, the washing apparatus (13) is now lowered so that its lower part is at a level below the upper surface of the filter bed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a filtering apparatus for 
filtering a suspension or emulsion 
in accordance with the 
preamble of claim 1. It may be read from US-A-4.197.201 
that filtering a suspension or emulsion in a filter bed 
comprising particulate filter material may be carried out by 
allowing the suspension to flow upwards through the filter bed, 
simultaneously as the filter medium flows downwards through a 
filtering tank in which the filtration takes place. Filtering 
thus takes place during counter flow between suspension and 
filter medium. The suspension is supplied at a lower part of 
the filter bed and the filtered liquid phase is taken away from 
a zone above the filter bed. The polluted filter medium close 
to the bottom of the filter tank is taken out and conveyed to a 
washing apparatus above the filter bed or partly immersed into and 
separately arranged relative to the filter bed, and after washing it is 
returned to the upper side of the filter bed. By continuous 
supply of suspension to the filter bed, continuous extraction 
of filtered liquid phase as well as continuous conveyance of 
polluted filter medium to the washing apparatus and washed 
filter medium back to the filter bed results in that the 
filtering apparatus operates completely continuously, and does 
not normally need to be taken out of operation. Such filtering apparatus may reach considerable dimensions in 
order to receive large suspension flows. In large installations 
there may be a plurality of filtering units, which are placed 
side by side and work in parallel, this being more practical or 
more suited to the available space. A method of arranging a 
large installation of this kind is illustrated in figure 3 of 
the previously mentioned US-A-4.197.201. A normal 
circular shape of the filtering units has been departed from 
here, and a hexagonal shape has been adopted to achieve  
 
compaction of the units. Since conveyance of the filter medium 
to the washing apparatus takes place through the filter bed, 
and the washing apparatus is also within the outer shell of the 
unit, there is nothing to prevent such compaction of such 
filtering units. A number of factors affect the selection of the filter 
apparatus size, such as type of suspension or emulsion, desired 
purification degree, type of filter medium and, as previously 
mentioned, the magnitude of the suspension flow that is to be 
filtered. These factors determine the area and height of the 
filter bed body or bodies. The filtering apparatus is then

<CLAIMS>
Filtering apparatus including: a zone of a particulate 
filter medium forming a filter bed (1) extending vertically in 

the filtering apparatus; an inlet (6) for the suspension or 
emulsion which is to be filtered, said inlet being situated in 

the lower part of the filter bed zone, so that the suspension 
is flowing in a direction upwards through the filter bed during 

filtration; a bottom space of the apparatus situated under said 
inlet (6) and in free communication with the filter bed zone, 

the filter medium continuously being supplied to this bottom 
space by the medium flowing in a direction downwards through 

the filter bed zone; a conveying means (11,12) opening out into 
the bottom space for elevating filtration-polluted filter 

medium which has been supplied to the bottom space, and which 
the means (11,12) conveys to a washing apparatus (13) separate 

from the filter bed in the filtering apparatus; said washing 
apparatus being arranged and formed for washing with counterflow 

between the filter medium and a washing liquid, the washed 
filter medium being taken from it and returned to the upper 

side of the filter bed zone; and an outlet (18) for washing 
liquid polluted by washing arranged at the upper part of the 

washing apparatus, whereat the washing apparatus includes a 
vertical cylinder (14) inside the filtering apparatus, the 

washing liquid having its inlet to the cylinder (14) at the 
lower end thereof, its outlet (18) from the washing apparatus 

above the upper end of the cylinder,the lower end of the 
cylinder (14) being situated at a level lower than the upper 

surface of the filter bed, but at a given distance above the 
intake of the conveying means (11, 12) for the polluted filter 

medium, 
characterized in
 that the washing 
apparatus is situated inside the filter bed and is surrounded 

by a chamber (17) with an opening upwards towards the zone (8) 
of filtered liquid phase, the lower end of the cylinder (14) 

being in communication with a reception space (19) for washed 
filter medium in the bottom portion of the chamber (17), where 

a second conveying means (20) has its intake for said washed  
 

filter medium, the outlet of said conveying means (20) being 
above the upper surface of the filter bed. 
Filtering apparatus as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized
 
in that the outlet (18) of the washing liquid is 

lower than the level of the filtered phase (8) above the filter 
bed (1). 
Filtering apparatus as claimed in claim 2, 
characterized
 
in that the height difference between said outlet (8) 

and said level is regulatable. 
Filtering apparatus as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized
 
in that above the cylinder (14) there is a 

collection chamber (8a) for the polluted washing liquid.
