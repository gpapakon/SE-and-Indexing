<ABSTRACT>
The disclosure relates to a peristaltic pump 
constructed of a relatively small number of components 

so that performance and reliability criteria can be 
satisfied in a relatively economical and compact pump. 

The pump (10) has an occlusion bed (16) which pivots 
about a pair of hinge pins (22) integrally molded with 

the occlusion bed which are received in lugs integrally 
molded with the base (18) of the pump. The occlusion 

bed (16) also preferably includes an integral 
resiliently-biased latch member (28) which cooperates 

with a latch plate (36) integrally molded in the base 
(18) of the pump. The pump preferably includes a rotor 

(14) in which each of the roller support pins (88) is 
molded integrally on the pump, a pair of cantilevered 

leaf springs (72,74) urge tubing into slots (64,66) on 
tubing retainer plates (62,63) disposed adjacent the 

rotor. The roller pins (85) and rollers (86) may be 
made of a low friction composite material which 

eliminates the need for bearings therebetween.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to pumps, and
more particularly to a peristaltic pump wherein a
plurality of rollers disposed on a rotor successively
engage one or more lengths of tubing to effect pumping
of fluid therethrough.In recent years, peristaltic pumps have proven to
be well suited for many applications involving pumping
of various fluids in laboratory, medical, and other
applications. A particular advantage of peristaltic
pumps is their ability to pump fluids through a
continuous, unbroken length of tubing, without the
fluid in the tubing contacting any components of the
pump other than the tubing itself.In many contexts, it is desirable to change
tubing frequently in a particular pump. Various
efforts have been made to enable removal and insertion
of tubing with relatively little time and effort. For
example, US Patent No. 5,082,429 and US patent No.
4,231,725 discloses peristaltic pumps having movable
occlusion beds which can be shifted between a closed,
or operating position, and an open, or
loading/unloading position, to facilitate changing of
tubing. Other peristaltic pumps are illustrated in US
Patent No. 4,256,442; No. 5,133,650; No. 3,963,023;
No. 5,110,270; No. 4,886,431; and No. 5,147,312.US 5,230,614 discloses a peristaltic pump having
a base, a rotor and a pump arm. The pump arm is
pivotally mounted on the base about an axis parallel
to the rotor axis so as to be movable towards and away
from the rotor to enable loading and unloading of 
tubing.FR 2,458,694, which forms the basis of the
preamble of claim 1, also discloses a peristaltic pump
having a base, a rotor and a pump arm. The pump arm
is pivotally mounted on the base about an axis
perpendicular to the rotor axis and the pump arm
substantially encloses the rotor in the closed
position so that it must be rotated through a large
angle to allow access to the rotor to replace tubing.
The pump arm includes a latch lever with a protrusion
for releasably engaging a latch plate to maintain the
pump arm in a closed position.The provision of a mechanism for quickly and
easily opening the pump to permit loading and
unloading of tubing, and closing the pump to permit
peristaltic pumping, requires that several
considerations be addressed. Among these are the fact
that in the closed position, the occlusion bed must be
stably supported in a desired spatial relationship to
the rotor, notwithstanding relatively high dynamic
pumping forces directed radially outward against the
occlusion bed during pumping. The locking mechanism
must be capable

<CLAIMS>
A peristaltic pump (10) comprising a base
(18), a rotor (14) supported on said base (18), said

rotor (14) comprising a support structure and a
plurality of rollers (86) mounted thereon, and an

occlusion bed (16) supported on said base (18) so as
to be movable between an open position in which said

occlusion bed (16) is spaced from said rotor (14) by a
relatively larger distance to enable loading and

unloading of tubing (12), and a closed position in
which said occlusion bed (16) is spaced from said

rotor (14) by a relatively smaller distance to enable
peristaltic pumping upon rotation of said rotor (14),

said occlusion bed (16) being pivotable about a fixed
axis perpendicular to the axis of said rotor (14) and

adjacent said base (18) and said occlusion bed (16)
being a one-piece structure comprising an integral

latch lever (28) with an integral protrusion (34),
said base (18) including a latch plate (36), the

protrusion (34) being releasably engageable with the
latch plate (36) to provide a snap-action lock

mechanism for selectively maintaining said occlusion
bed in the said closed position, characterised in that

the latch lever (28) has a generally L-shaped
configuration, comprising a first wall (30) extending at

the rear of the occlusion bed (16) in a direction away
from the rotor (14) and a second wall (32) extending

forward from the bottom of the first wall (30), that
the protrusion (34) is wedge-shaped and arranged on

that surface of the second wall (32) facing the
occlusion bed (16), and that the fixed axis of the

occlusion bed (16) and the latch plate (36) are
arranged on the base (18) such that the protrusion

(34) engages the latch plate (36) also in the open 
position of the occlusion bed (16) in order to limit

the extent of pivotal movement of said occlusion bed

sides thereof, and wherein said base (18) comprises a

pair of slots (24) for receiving said hinge pins (22),
whereby said axially aligned hinge pins (22) provide a

pivot axis for movement of said occlusion bed (16)
