<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a composition utilizing
a universal detection system based on polynucleotide
interactions which can be used in assays, both immunoassays
and nucleic acid assays of analytes.The analysis and detection of minute quantities of
substances in biological and non-biological samples has
become a routine practice in clinical and analytical
laboratories around the world. Broadly, the analytical
techniques can be divided into those based on ligand-receptor
interactions (e.g., immunoassay-based
techniques), and those based on nucleic acid
hybridization (polynucleotide sequence-based
techniques)For example, immunoassay techniques involve, at
some stage or step in the process, the non-covalent
association between an antibody binding site and an
antigen complementary therefor. See, for example, "An 
Introduction to Radioimmunoassay and Related
Techniques" by T. Chard, North Holland Publishing
Company, Amsterdam, New York, Oxford, 1978. In
polynucleotide sequence-based techniques, the process,
at some step or another, involves the non-covalent
binding of a polynucleotide sequence to a complementary
sequence under hybridization conditions. (See for
example, Falkow et al, U.S. Patent 4,358,535, Wahl et
al, U.S. Patent 4,302,204, and Heimer, U.S. Patent
3,755,086.)In a generalized sense, both the aforementioned
techniques involve a primary recognition event, brought
about by precise molecular alignment and interaction,
and energetically favored by the release of non-covalent
bonding free energy (e.g., hydrogen bonding,
dispersion bonding, ionic bonding, dipolar bonding, and
the like). In addition to the primary recognition
event, both techniques also involve, at one step or
another, a signalling event. This step or event
relates to the necessity of detecting, in some
demonstrable manner to a human or instrument detection
system, the primary recognition event.Signalling has been centered mainly in two broad
areas: radioactive and non-radioactive techniques.
Radioactive signalling has relied on radiolabeling of
one or more components involved in the system, with 
such atoms as 32P, 131I, 14C, 3H, and the like.
Detection is usually by means of a radioactivity
detector. Non-radioactive techniques have been
increasingly used in the last few years, since they
involve no radioactivity, thus making such techniques
safer, cleaner and more stable towards storage. They
have been developed to sensitivities as high if not
higher than radiolabeling techniques. Among the most
common non-radioactive
