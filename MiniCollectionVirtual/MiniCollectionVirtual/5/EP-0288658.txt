<ABSTRACT>
A method of controlling a motor vehicle air conditioning system is described. The motor vehicle air conditioning system comprises a refrigeration circuit with a coolant compressor (43), a condenser (16, 51), an evaporator (21, 22) and a restriction device (23, 24) located upstream of the evaporator (21, 22). A fan is assigned to the condenser (16, 51) and a blower (58) to the evaporator (21, 22). The compressor output, the condenser output and the evaporator output are detected directly or indirectly by sensors (52, 53) and fed as electrical variables to an electronic control circuit (1) which combines these input signals and generates output signals as a function of at least two of these output values and incorporating other parameters. The control circuit (1) acts on electrically controllable control elements (10, 11, 65, 66, 23, 24) to influence the compressor output, the condensor output and/or the evaporator output.
