<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of an adjustable hinge pin for window or door shutters, having a bracket (1) and a rod (6) which has a peg (20) which can be pushed in a guide (9) in the bracket (1). Provided on the push-in part of the rod (6) is at least one longitudinal cutout (10, 10'), which at one end forms a stop (11, 11') for a retaining element (13, 23) which limits the drawing-out movement of the rod (6).

Adjustable hinge pin for window shutters or door shutters 
comprising a bracket (1) which can be fixed to 

the wall (3) or to the frame and a pin bar (6) having 
a hinge pin (20) and which can be inserted into a 

guide (9) in the bracket (1), with the inserted pin 
bar (6) being securable relative to the bracket (1) in 

predeterminable positions by means of at least one 
fixing e
lement, in particular a grub screw (17), characterised 
in that at least one longitudinal recess 

(10, 10') is provided at the insertable part of the 
pin bar (6), with the end of the recess disposed at 

the wall or frame side forming an abutment (11, 11') 
for a holding element (13, 23) which restricts the 

pull-out movement of the pin bar (6), with the holding 
element being held in the bracket (1) and being adjustable 

between a position disposed outside of the 
longitudinal recess (10, 10') and a position in which 

it engages into the longitudinal recess (10, 10'). 
Adjustable hinge pin in accordance with claim 1, characterised 
in that the holding element is formed as a 

leaf spring (13) lying longitudinally to the pin bar 
(6), with its one end being held in the bracket (1) 

and its other free end having an abutment (14) which 
is in particular formed as a bent portion which contacts 

the abutment (11) when the pin bar (6) is fully 
drawn out, with the leaf spring (13) being delatchable 

under pre-stress out of the longitudinal recess (10) 
in the pin bar (6) via a cut-out (15).  

 
Adjustable hinge pin in accordance with claim 2, characterised 
in that the cut-out (15) is present as a 

bore in the bracket projection (5) and extends transversely 
to the longitudinal recess (10, 10'); and in 

that the abutment (14) and/or the wall or frame end of 
the pin bar (6) preferably have a respective run-up 

ramp (21, 21', 22), with a broadened portion (12) 
preferably being provided in the bracket (1) into 

which the leaf spring (13) is insertable and deformable 
against the bias. 
Adjustable hinge pin in accordance with claim 1, 
characterised in that the holding element is formed as 

a pin which can be inserted into and fixed into an 
opening (24) in the bracket (1) and extends substantially 

transverse to the longitudinal recess (10, 
10'), with the pin (23) being in particular moulded 

onto and separable from the bracket (1) and in particular 
being formed as a pin moulded on in the region 

of the opening (24). 
Adjustable hinge pin in accordance with one or more 
of the preceding claims, characterised in that the 

longitudinal recess (10, 10') is arranged fully within 
the bracket (1) when the pin bar (6) is pulled out 

fully. 
Adjustable hinge pin in accordance with one or more 
of the preceding claims, characterised in that the 

guide (9) is formed so that it is form-fitted to the 
pin bar (6) at least in its region serving as the outlet 

opening (19) for the pin bar (6).  
 
Adjustable hinge pin in accordance with one or more 
of the preceding claims, characterised in that the 

fixing element (17) engages at the side (7') of the 
pin bar (6) opposite to the holding element (13, 23). 
Adjustable hinge pin in accordance with one or more 
of the preceding claims, characterised in that the pin 

bar (6) has two diametrically oppositely disposed longitudinal 
recesses (10, 10'), and preferably in that 

the front end (18) of the grub screw (17) engages into 
the one longitudinal recess (10') and the holding element 

(13, 23) into the other longitudinal recess (10). 
Adjustable hinge pin in accordance with one or more 
of the preceding claims, characterised in that the 

fixing element (17) and the holding element (13, 23) 
are arranged displaced relative to one another in the 

axial direction of the guide (9).
