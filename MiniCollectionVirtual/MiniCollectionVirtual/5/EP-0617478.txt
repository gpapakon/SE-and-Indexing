<ABSTRACT>
In a laminated dielectric resonator, twomo strip line is 
formed and resonant frequency is lowered. Accordingly, the 

length of the resonator is reduced, and the length of the strip 
line (2) becomes shorter than one fourth of the wavelength with the 

lowered resonant frequency, which leads to further reduction of 
the length of the resonator. By lowering the resonant frequency, 

dielectric material with less relative permittivity can be 
used, with a result of resonator with high unloaded Q and 

excellent temperature characteristic. Further, at least one 
coupling electrode (7b) is formed as external or internal electrode 

to compose a capacitor together with a second strip line (4), and 
a laminated dielectric resonator is connected to an external 

circuit via the coupling electrode (8). A dielectric filter such as 
band pass filter, band elimination filter is so composed that 

the dielectric resonators are cascade-connected to one another. 
In the thus constructed dielectric filter, external coupling 

capacitors are unnecessary, reducing the number of parts and 
facilitating the manufacturing process. Thus, a small-sized, 

low-cost dielectric filter is attained.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a laminated dielectric resonator
and a dielectric filter which are chiefly used in high-frequency
radio tools such as a portable phone. The laminated dielectric
resonator is solely used as a resonant element such as
a high-frequency oscillation circuit, or used, as combination
of a plurality of laminated dielectric resonators, for composing
a dielectric filter working as a band-pass filter or a band
elimination filter.Accompanied by development of vehicular communication,
small-sized portable phones have been desired. Size reduction
of parts to be used therein is the key for reducing the size of
high-frequency radio tool such as a portable phone. Since a
dielectric filter widely used as a high-frequency filter is one
of high-frequency parts which largely occupies the radio
circuit of the portable phone, the size reduction thereof is
desired.The dielectric filter is composed of a plurality of
dielectric resonators which are cascade-connected to one
another via joint elements. Conventionally, a coaxial dielectric
resonator in which an electrode is formed on a surface of
coaxial ceramic element is used for the dielectric resonator,
and the conventional dielectric filter is composed of the
coaxial dielectric resonators. However, since micro-fabrication
of the ceramic in manufacturing the coaxial dielectric resonator 
is too limited to be thinned, a laminated dielectric
resonator which is composed of a plane-type strip line resonator
is contemplated.One example of the conventional laminated dielectric
resonators is explained, with reference to drawings. FIG.15(a)
is a perspective exploded view of the conventional laminated
dielectric resonator. FIG.15(b) is a section, taken along a
line X-X' in FIG.15(a).In FIGS.15(a), (b), a strip line 36 is formed on a first
dielectric sheet 35, and shield electrodes 7 are respectively
provided on and under the strip line 36 via dielectric sheets
35, 37 laminated thereon and thereunder. One end of the strip
line 36 is grounded via a ground electrode 9 so as to compose
an end-short strip line resonator. Impedance at an open end is
infinite with a frequency corresponding to a wavelength of
electromagnetic wave which is four times the length of
the strip line 36, so as to perform parallel resonance. Such a
laminated dielectric resonator is disclosed, for example, in
FIG.1 of JP.2-
290303 A1.Under the above construction, however, the resonator can be
thinned but has conventional length. The dielectric ceramic
material to be laminated is so limited
