<ABSTRACT>
A power supply unit for converting AC voltage or a pulsating DC voltage (Up) into a lower DC voltage (Uout) has a DC circuit (16, 25) which contains an energy storage capacitor (14), furthermore a controllable switching element (46) which is used to charge the energy storage capacitor (14) from the pulsating DC voltage (Up), can be controlled by the charge voltage of the energy storage capacitor (14) and/or by a load (70), and is switched off in those regions of the pulsating DC voltage (Up) in which the instantaneous value of this voltage is more than a predetermined limit value (Ulim). A preferred application is the power supply of a DC motor (70) for a low operating voltage since, in this case, the motor rotation speed can also be controlled or regulated in a simple manner.

Power supply unit, in particular for a low-voltage
direct-current motor (70; 80), for transforming a

pulsating direct-current voltage (U
p
) into a lower
direct-current voltage (U
out
), with a direct-current
circuit (16, 25) containing a storage capacitor (14), and

with an electronic switch (46) which serves to charge the
storage capacitor (14) from the pulsating direct-current

voltage (U
p
) and which is only switched on at the
beginning and end of a half wave of the pulsating direct-current

voltage (U
p
) in order to feed current pulses (i)
to the storage capacitor (14) to charge it, and which is

switched off in the ranges (T
n
) of the pulsating direct-current
voltage (U
p
) in which the instantaneous value of
this pulsating direct-current voltage (U

predetermined limit value, 
characterised in that
 an
electronic control member (18; 30) is provided which is

controlled by the voltage (U

Power supply unit according to claim 1 or 2, in

switch-off signal for the electronic switch (46) via the
electronic control member (18) when the speed of this

motor exceeds a predetermined value. 
Power supply unit according to one or more of claims

produces a switch-off signal for the electronic switch

prevents the production of a high-amplitude switch-on
