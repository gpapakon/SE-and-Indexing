<DESCRIPTION>
This patent application concerns a procedure for the 
preparation of ginger-root infusion for desensitizing teeth 
and gums to temperature changes, and the infusion obtained 
according to said procedure. The infusion in question is developed and produced as a 
natural medication to eliminate or at least substantially 
reduce the pain experienced by many people to teeth and 
gums when drinking very hot or cold drinks or when they eat 
food that sensitizes teeth or tooth necks. These painful areas moreover can not be brushed with a 
normal toothbrush. To date, the only solution to this problem was to resort to 
the care of a dental surgeon, often without success (no 
truly efficient remedy is available) or to use strong 
chemically based analgesics with harmful side effects. The infusion according to the invention - which is produced 
from ginger-root - may be considered as an alternative 
remedy to the analgesics used to treat the above problems; 
in view of the fact that it is a natural product, there are  
 
no side effects and it may therefore be used without 
limitation or restrictions. The action of this preparation causes a total narrowing of 
the dental tubes, through which teeth and gums are 
desensitized; the preparation also acts as an antiseptic 
and astringent for gums. In particular attention is drawn to the fact that by using 
this preparation, it will be possible to brush teeth and 
gums with a normal toothbrush. In order to develop a ginger-root infusion with the above 
properties, a procedure consisting of an established 
sequence of operating phases was perfected after extensive 
research and experiments. This procedure involves cutting fine slices of ginger-root, 
which should preferably be fresh, and then boiling them 
until half the water placed initially in the container has 
evaporated; the water in which said slices of ginger-root 
are boiled is then filtered in order to separate the solid 
and exploited slices of ginger-root from the infusion. For major clarity a practical example is given of the 
preparation according to the invention using 20 gr. of 
ginger-root. After cutting the ginger-root in thin slices, this quantity 
of ginger-root is boiled in half a litre of water for 
approximately 30/35 minutes: namely the time normally 
required to boil away 50% of the water used for the 
infusion; the infusion may be filtered only once half of 
the water has boiled away.  Using larger quantities of ginger-root will give a more 
concentrated infusion which is consequently stronger
