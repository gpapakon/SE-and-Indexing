<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus for 
coreless winding and more particularly including the 
stabilization of the interior portion of a coreless wound log of 
paper or the like. A "log" has the same diameter as the 
commercial sized roll (toilet tissue, toweling, etc.) but is 
much longer. Current practice is to transversely cut the log 
into rolls, viz., in the U.S. 4-1/2" long for toilet tissue and 
11" long for kitchen toweling. A few coreless wound products have been in existence 
for the last 10 or 15 years. These can be separated into three 
categories. First, there is the large diameter tissue and towel 
rolls made to dispense from the center and exemplified by U.K. 
Patent 1,554,619. Second, there are tissue rolls with very 
small "core" diameters made to dispense either from special,  
 
barbed shafts or without the use of any dispensing shaft but 
rather using a cradle. The use of these two categories has been 
generally confined to Europe. Third, there is a category which 
is frequently discussed but has never caught on. Exemplary of 
this is a bathroom tissue roll for a standard home dispenser but 
without the core. One of the obstacles in developing such a 
product is the instability of the interior of the coreless log. 
Without a core the center of the log is subject to collapse or 
unwinding from the interior. This causes problems first at the 
log saw -- wherein the elongated "log" is transversely cut into 
retail size lengths or rolls, and also during packaging and 
shipping and finally when the user attempts to install it on the 
dispenser shaft. According to the invention, the problems associated 
with the third category is solved through stabilizing the log 
interior by applying a fixing agent to the inside plies. In a 
sense, this could be considered analogous to tail sealing (see 
U.S. Patent 3,044,532 to Ghisoni) except that it works on the 
inside tail. More particularly, the invention contemplates winding a 
web in convolute fashion on a "bare" mandrel and applying the 
stabilizing agent prior to complete removal of the wound log 
from the mandrel. In one embodiment, the stabilizing or fixing 
agent can be applied during the course of the log winding -- as 
by delivering the agent through axially or spirally spaced ports 
in the mandrel. Alternatively, the stabilizing agent can be 
applied prior to or during the "stripping" of the log from the 
mandrel. This is achieved through the use of a discharge  
 
orifice means adjacent the end of the mandrel from which the

<CLAIMS>
A method of making a coreless convolutely wound web 
roll comprising the steps of transferring the leading edge 

portion of a web to a mandrel (18, 118) and maintaining the web 
in contact with said mandrel to provide a hollow axially 

extending interior, winding said web on said mandrel to a 
predetermined diameter log, removing said predetermined diameter 

log from said mandrel, characterized in prior to completely 
removing said log applying a stabilizing agent to said 

interior. 
The method of claim 1 in which the step of applying 
a stabilizing agent is performed during the step of winding said 

web on said mandrel. 
The method of claim 1 in which the step of applying 
a stabilizing agent occurs during the removal of the log from 

the mandrel. 
The method of claim 1 in which said stabilizing 
agent is a fluid including a pressurized gas and liquid droplets 

disposed therein. 
The method of claim 1 in which said stabilizing 
agent includes a liquid applied by pressure through said 

mandrel. 
The method of claim 1 in which said step of 
maintaining the web in contact with said mandrel includes 

providing passage means (21) extending generally longitudinally 
of said mandrel and terminating in port means (22) disposed 

generally along the mandrel length, said applying step 
introducing a pressure fluid into said passage means and 

distributing said pressure fluid through said port means. 
The method of claim 6 in which said maintaining 
step includes coupling said passage means to vacuum means (25, 

25a, 26) incident to maintaining said web on said mandrel. 
The method of claim 1 in which said steps include 
providing passage means (121) extending generally longitudinally 

of said mandrel and terminating in port means (122) being 
radially aligned adjacent the end of said mandrel, said applying 

step including introducing a pressure fluid into said passage 
means and discharging the same through said port means incident 

to stripping said log from said mandrel. 
The method of claim 1 in which said maintaining 
step includes the step of enveloping the leading edge portion of 

said web within a convolutely wound layer. 
Apparatus for practicing the method of claim 1 for 
making a coreless convolutely wound web roll comprising a frame, 

a mandrel (18, 118) rotatably mounted on said frame and equipped 

with interior passage means (21, 121) for delivering stabilizing 
fluid to the interior of a web roll on said mandrel, and means 

(25, 136) operably associated with said mandrel for maintaining 
a web in contact with said mandrel at least during the beginning 

of winding said web to develop said roll.
