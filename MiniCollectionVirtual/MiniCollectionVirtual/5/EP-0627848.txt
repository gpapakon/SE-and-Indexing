<ABSTRACT>
Incident light is refracted by a planar plate (30) 
which is fixedly slanted with respect to the optical axis, 

before being imaged on an image receiving surface of an image 
sensor (10). The planar plate (30) rotates about the optical 

axis or an axis parallel to the optical axis. In accordance 
with the rotational movement of the planar plate, the 

incident light imaged position moves on the image receiving 
surface of the image sensor (10). Light portions originally 

imaged on gap areas between neighboring light pick up 
elements of the image sensor (10) move into the light pick up 

elements. The image sensor can therefore pick up those image 
portions which are originally imaged on the gap areas and 

therefore which may not be picked up by the image sensor. 
Picking up an image every time when its image position moves 

and composing thus obtained images by the composing device (70) 
can obtain a high quality image which has little area of 

image portions which are imaged on the gap areas between the 
light pick up elements and therefore which are not picked up.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a solid-state image-pick-up 
device for obtaining a high quality image with the 
use of a solid-state image sensor comprised of a plurality of 
light pick-up elements. A solid-state image sensor employed in a solid-state 
image pick up device has a plurality of solid-state light 
pick up elements arranged both in the horizontal and vertical 
directions. Each of the plurality of solid-state light pick 
up elements stores an electric charge corresponding to its 
received picture element light ray, and transfers the stored 
electric charge to a nearby light pick up element, to thereby 
pick up an image. The image resolution obtainable by the 
solid-state image pick-up device therefore depends on a 
density at which the plurality of light pick up elements are 
arranged. There is known a solid-state image pick up device for 
obtaining a high quality image with the use of the solid-state 
image sensor as described in Japanese Unexamined Patent 
Application Publication KOKAI No.3-276981. As shown in Fig. 
1, the solid-state image pick up device 200 includes a lens 
201 for converging light from an object to be imaged, a 
solid-state image sensor 202, and a pair of transparent 
refraction plates 203 and 204 located between the lens 201 
and the solid-state image sensor 202. The transparent  
 
refractive plates 203 and 204 are mounted on stepper motors 
205 and 206, respectively. The stepper motors 205 and 206 
are driven by a driving circuit 208 to stepwisely rotate the 
transparent refractive plates 203 and 204. Due to the 
rotations, the refraction plates 203 and 204 slant relative 
to the optical axis of the lens 201 so as to refract light 
from the lens 201 in two directions to thereby shift a 
position, on the image sensor 202, at which the light ray 
focused or imaged by the lens 201 reaches. Generally, the 
image sensor 202 may not pick up portions of a light image 
that reach boundaries or gap areas between neighboring light 
pick up elements. However, thus shifting the positions at 
which light is focused on the image sensor 202 enables the 
image sensor 202 to pick up those image portions which will 
be focused on the gap areas if the plates 203 and 204 are not 
provided. The image sensor 202 is driven to repeatedly pick 
up the received images in synchronism with the stepwise 
rotation of the refraction plates 204 and 205. A plurality 
of images thus picked up by the image sensor are composed or 
synthesized into a final image in an image signal processing 
device
