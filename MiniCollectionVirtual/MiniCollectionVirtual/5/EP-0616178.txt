<ABSTRACT>
In the case of an outlet with a vortex flow, having a blowing-out plate (2) and outlet openings (3) for warm and/or cold air which are provided in the latter, and having at least one air jet-guiding lamella (4) which is assigned to each outlet opening (3), is to be individually regulated and extends between two bearing discs (6a, 6b), the bearing discs (6a, 6b) or a part (15) thereof are to have a different colour from the air jet-guiding lamella (4) and/or the blowing-out plate (2).

Vortex flow outlet, having an extractor panel 
(2) and outlet apertures (3) provided therein for hot 

and/or cold air, and having at least one airflow guide 
strip (4), which is associated with each outlet 

aperture (3) and is to be individually controlled, 
said airflow guide strip extending between two bearing 

discs (6a, 6b), each bearing disc (6a, 6b) being 
inserted into the outlet aperture (3) and having a 

plate (10), in each side of which a groove (11, 12) is 
provided for the accommodation of an edge (13, 14) of 

the outlet aperture (3), characterised in that an 
edging strip (15) is angled from the plate (10) 

beneath the grooves (11, 12). 
Method of producing a vortex flow outlet, 
having an extractor panel (2) and outlet apertures (3) 

provided therein for hot and/or cold air, and having 
at least one airflow guide strip (4), which is 

associated with each outlet aperture (3) and is to be 
individually controlled, said airflow guide strip 

extending between two bearing discs (6a, 6b), a groove 
(11, 12) being provided for the provision of the 

bearing discs (6a, 6b) in each side of a plate (10) to  
 

accommodate an edge (13, 14) of the outlet aperture 
(3), an edging strip (15) being angled from the plate 

(10) beneath the grooves (11, 12), and then the 
bearing disc (6a, 6b) being provided with a colour 

coating, which differs from the extractor panel and/or 
the airflow guide strips (4), and being inserted into 

the outlet aperture (3).
