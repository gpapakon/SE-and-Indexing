<ABSTRACT>
The cooking vessel comprises a container (1) and a lid consisting of an inner cover (3) and an upper cover (5). The container has a downwardly angled peripheral edge (2) on which twelve individual hook-like closures (21) act to close the cooking vessel. These closures (21) are pivoted peripherally on the inner edge (4) of the lid so that they can be pivoted by pressing the upper cover (5) against the closures (21). The closures (21) are C-shaped with a hook section (32) in such a way that, in the pivoted position corresponding to the closed state, the ends of this hook section (32) engaged beneath the container edge (2) from outside. In the pivoted position corresponding to the open state, the ends of this hook section (32) are at a distance from the container edge (2), making it possible easily to lift the inner cover (3) off the c ontainer (1).

<CLAIMS>
Cooking vessel having a container (1) and a lid comprising an
inner lid part (3) and an upper lid part (5), wherein the

container (1) comprises a bent peripheral container rim (2) and
the lid comprises at least three single lock elements (9)

peripherally arranged around the rim (4) of the inner lid part
(3), which are swivellingly disposed, which serve for locking the

cooking vessel and whereby each comprises a hook-shaped part (9'')
serving as locking part, whereby the rim area of the upper lid

part (5) is shaped to produce a swivel movement of the lock
elements (9) by pushing the upper lid part (5) against them,

whereby the lock elements (9) are arranged at the outer rim (4) of
the inner lid part (3) in such a way that said lock elements in

the swivel position corresponding to the closed state, press with
the end of the hook-shaped locking part (9'') from the outside

against the container rim (2), and that in the swivel position
corresponding to the opened state, the ends of the hook-shaped

locking parts are at a distance (d) from the container rim (2)
such that an unhindered lifting of the inner lid part (3) from the

container (1) is possible, characterized in that at least one
spring (10) is provided which presses the lock elements (9) from

below upwards against the upper lid part (5).
Lid for the container (1) of a cooking vessel comprising an
inner lid part (3) and an upper lid part (5), wherein the

container (1) comprises a bent peripheral container rim (2) and
the lid comprises at least three single lock elements (9)

peripherally arranged around the rim (4) of the inner lid part
(3), which are swivellingly disposed, which serve for locking the

cooking vessel and whereby each comprises a hook-shaped part (9'')
serving as locking part, whereby the rim area of the upper lid

part (5) is shaped to produce a swivel movement of the lock
elements (9) by pushing the upper lid part (5) against them,

whereby the lock elements (9) are arranged at the outer rim (4) of
the inner lid part (3) in such a way that said lock elements in 

the swivel position corresponding to the closed state, press with
the end of the hook-shaped locking part (9'') from the outside

against the container rim (2), and that in the swivel position
corresponding to the opened state, the ends of the hook-shaped

locking parts are at a distance (d) from the container rim (2)
such that an unhindered lifting of the inner lid part (3) from the

container (1) is possible, characterized in that at least one
spring (10) is provided which presses the lock elements (9) from

below upwards against the upper lid part (5).
Lid according to claim 2, characterized in that the outer rim
(4) of the inner lid part (3) comprises upward bent tongues (8')

forming the upper part of a bearing for the individual lock
elements (9).
Lid according to claim 2 or 3, characterized in that the
outer lid part (5) at the inside at its rim is provided with a

peripheral stop (16) for the lock elements (9) and/or with a
central locking system (14) which connects releasably the said

outer lid part with the inner lid part (3).
Lid according to one of claims 2 to 4, characterized in that
each lock element (9) is provided with a bearing head (9') and an

at least approximately C-shaped hook-part (9''), whereby the
bearing head (9') of the lock elements comprises burl-like

extensions (25, 25') to improve the swivelling movement and
whereby the different lock elements comprise a lower part (28)

connected with a lobe (30) bent to one side and comprising a round
gap to radially support one of the said extensions (25, 25').
Lid according to one of claims 3 to 5, characterized in that
the lock element (9) comprises a depression (15) near its axe

having a width which is a little larger than the width of the
tongues (8') so that the lock element (9) is clamped by one such

tongue (8'). 
Lid according to one of claims 3 to 6, characterized in that
a couple of lock elements (9) are distributed around the rim of

the inner lid part (4) and in that the spring (10) extending
though the C-shaped openings of the hook-shaped parts (9'') presses

the lock elements from below upwards against a end of the tongues
(8') serving as stop.
Locking element for a lid according to one of claims 2 to 7,
with a bearing head (9') and a hook-shaped lock element (9'')

characterized in that said locking element comprises at the
outside a flat part (33) extending to the bearing head (9') and in

that said locking element further comprises a projecting shoulder
(22) in the area between the flat part (33) and the end of the

hook-shaped locking part (9'').
Locking element according to claim 8, characterized in that
the said locking element is formed in one piece in the area

between the flat part (33) and the end (34) of the hook-shaped
locking part (9'').
