<ABSTRACT>
A forced intra-frame coding method in which video data is coded in the 
vertical direction of a frame and the coding is performed for forcibly intra-frame 

coded macro block (MB) lines set to have a predetermined vertical 
interval. Whenever the coding for respective frames is finished, the macro 

block lines are shifted downward by one macro block so that the original 
image is restored relatively rapidly. Furthermore, the coding direction of 

macro blocks is set to be vertical so that the amount of data for respective 
macro blocks stays uniform and the transmission buffer of a coder is easily 

controlled.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system for coding a digital video
signal, and particularly although not exclusively, to a forced intra-frame
coding method for coding to rapidly and precisely reproduce forced intra-frame
coded video data.Generally speaking, apparatus for digital processing of video and audio
signals such as a high-definition television set, high-definition video cassette
recorder, digital video cassette recorder, and digital camcorder, contain a
system for coding, transmitting and storing the video and audio signals in
digital data, and thereafter decoding and reproducing the coded data. For
industrial use of such coding/decoding systems international standardization,
is in progress so as to determine standard formats appropriate for individual
application fields.Referring to the accompanying drawings, Figures 1a and 1b are block
diagrams of conventional coding and decoding systems;
Figures 2a and 2b are conceptional diagrams of the format of coded
video data; Figures 3a, 3b and 3c are conceptional diagrams to explain the
conventional forced intra-frame coding;Figure 1a is a block diagram of a general coding system, whose
operation is well-known to ordinary skilled persons in the art. Intra-frame
and inter-frame coding will be briefly discussed with reference to Figure 1a.For intra-frame coding, switches 22 and 23 are both turned off so that
a subtractor 11 sends externally input video data to an orthogonal transformer
12. The external video data is fed to a variable-length encoder 14 via the
orthogonal transformer 12 and a quantizer 13. The video data is then
transmitted by a buffer 15 to a receiver.Thus, in the intra-frame coding the external video data, is input to the
subtractor 11 and then pulse-code modulated, and transmitted by the buffer 15
to a receiver.For inter-frame coding, switches 22 and 23 both are turned on so that
subtractor 11 subtracts video data supplied from a motion compensator 21
from the externally input video data. As a result, a difference signal of the
input video data and video data previous to the input video data by one frame
is applied to orthogonal transformer 12. An adder 18 adds data applied via
an inverse quantizer 16 and an inverse orthogonal transformer 17 to the output
data of the motion compensator 21, and outputs the added result to a frame
memory 19. In the inter-frame coding, the difference data obtained from
subtractor 11 is coded, stored in the buffer 15, and then output to the
receiver. Such a PCM or differential PCM technique is well-known

<CLAIMS>
A method of coding video data divided into predetermined size video
data blocks, the method characterised by comprising the steps of:


coding a video frame by : (a) receiving blocks of the video frame in a
vertical direction of said video frame from top to bottom thereof; and (b)

selectively intra-frame coding or inter-frame coding vertically said received blocks to
thereby reduce the amount of information and forcibly intra-frame coding a

number of vertically spaced apart horizontal block lines in said frame; and
subsequently coding a next video frame by repeating said steps (a) and
(b) for said next frame but shifting the location of said forcibly intra-frame

coded block lines vertically by at least one block.
A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein, when one macro block column
forming said video frame is completely input, said reception step (a) begins

receiving a macro block column located to the right of said completely input
macro block column.
A method as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein said coding step (b)
performs coding so that said forcibly intra-frame coded block lines are plural

for every frame.
A method as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein in said
subsequent coding step of said next video frame, said forcibly intra-frame

coded block lines are shifted downward by one block line for every frame. 
A method as claimed in any one of claim 1 to 4, wherein said forcibly
intra-frame coded block lines are made up of a plurality of macro blocks

forming one line of a video frame.
A method as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5, in which in said
subsequent coding step of said next video frame, successive said intra frame

coded block lines are set to have a predetermined vertical interval
therebetween.
A method of selectively intra/inter-frame coding video data divided
into a predetermined size of blocks comprising a forced intra-frame coding method

according to any one of claims 1 to 6.
