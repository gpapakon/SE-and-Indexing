<ABSTRACT>
The positive conveyors (14 to 26 and 114 to 126) that 
feed the products to the two packing machines (28,128), 

are driven in phase with these machines, which are 
powered by respective brushless motors (36,136), and are 

positioned with their initial portion to the side of the 
end part of the positive conveyor (5) that carries the 

products (2) from the exit of the manufacturing machine 
(1) and that is driven in phase by this machine, which is 

also powered by a brushless motor (35). A translation 
means (29) driven in a reciprocating manner by a brushless 

motor (34) operates at the point where the three 
said positive conveyors meet. All the aforesaid motors 

are controlled by an electronic microprocessor unit (37) 
which causes the packing machines to operate out of phase 

in such a way that the products coming from the manufacturing 
machine can be conveyed to the two packing 

machines in alternation. In the event of stoppage of one 
packing machine, said unit causes said translator (29) to 

transfer all the products to the active packing machine, 
which will preferably increase speed, while the manufacturing 

machine will slow down and adapt itself to the new 
situation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an apparatus for feeding 
products coming from a single manufacturing machine to 
two processing machines in alternation and flexibly. In 
particular the apparatus concerned has been designed to 
connect a high-output machine for folding and stacking 
paper towels or napkins to two packing machines, so that 
the resulting installation has a satisfactory operating 
capacity, even in the event of stoppage of one of the two 
packing machines. The features of the apparatus in question, and 
the advantages procured thereby, will be clear in the 
following description of a preferred embodiment, illustrated 
purely by way of a non-restricting example in the 
figures of the single accompanying sheet of drawings, in 
which: 
Fig. 1 is a schematic plan view of the apparatus 
from above; and Fig. 2 shows details of the apparatus of 
Fig. 1, viewed along the line of section II-II. In Fig. 1, 1 indicates the manufacturing machine 
that forms products 2, for example stacks of paper towels 
or napkins, which are conveyed in single file in the 
direction indicated by the arrow 2 by the push members 4 
of an endless conveyor 5, of known kind, which takes its 
motion from the same machine 1. As the conveyor 5 carries 
them along, the products 2 are controlled laterally by 
appropriate guide means 6, which can be adjusted to the 
dimensions of the products. In the present example, the 
conveyor 5 is of the kind in which the push members 4 
remain vertical when they reach the end part of the  
 
conveyor and pass from its top half to its bottom half 
around the spindle 7 (Fig. 2), so as not to harm the 
product 2. From the conveyor 5, the product 2 is positioned 
in the initial part of a belt conveyor 8 which 
takes its motion from the spindle 7 so that its top half 
is rotating in the same direction as the arrow 3 and at 
the same speed as said conveyor 5. Between conveyor 5 and 
conveyor 8 is a bridge 9 to enable the product to pass 
from one conveyor to the other without jamming. As it 
reaches the conveyor 8, the product stops against a 
vertical retainer 10 integral with an arm 110 fixed to 
the rotating mechanism of vertical axis of an actuator 11 
mounted on the support 12 and adjustable in the directions 
indicated by the arrow 13, so that the position of 
the retainer 10 can be adjusted to the dimensions of the 
products 2. To the side of the initial part of the 
conveyor 8, on which a product cyclically stops, on 
either side of this conveyor are identical curved channels

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for feeding products (2) coming from a 
single manufacturing machine (1) to two processing machines 

(28, 128) in alternation, 
characterized by the fact of comprising: 


a first positive conveyor (5) carrying the products (2) 
from the manufacturing machine (1) to a second conveyor (8) 

at which there is arranged a retainer (10) for stopping the 
products; 
a pair of diverging positive conveyors (14, 114) arranged 
each at a side of the second conveyor (8), said diverging 

conveyors leading each to a processing machine (28,128); 
a translator device (29) driven in a reciprocating manner 
so as to move alternately sidewise the products from the 

second conveyor (8) to each one of the said diverging 
conveyors (14, 114). 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the said first positive conveyor (5) is driven by a speed-and 

phase-controlled electric motor (35), the translator 
device (29) is driven by a speed- and phase-controlled 

electric motor (34), the diverging positive conveyors 
(14,114) are driven by respective speed- and 

phase-controlled electric motors (36, 136) and all the 

aforesaid motors (34, 35, 36, 136) are controlled by a 
programmable processor unit (37) which causes the packing 

machines (28, 128) to operate out of phase in such a way 
that the products coming from the manufacturing machine can 

be discharged in alternation to the conveyors that feed the 
said packing machines, in such a manner that the 

 
manufacturing machine (1) can present a greater operating 

capacity than each of the packing machines (28, 128), while 
in the event of stoppage of one packing machine, said 

processor unit causes the translator device to tranfer all 
the products to the operating packing machine the speed of 

which will be increased, while the speed of the 
manufacturing machine will be slowed down. 
Apparatus according to claim 2, in which the processor 
unit (37) can operate in such a way that the products coming 

from the manufacturing machine (1) are sorted at different 
frequencies to the diverging conveyors that feed the packing 

machines (28, 128) so that the said packing machines can 
operate at different speeds. 
Apparatus according to claim 2 in which the retainer 
(10) is mounted on an actuator (11) controlled by the 

processor unit (37) whereby, in case of emergency such as 
the unintended stoppage of both packing machines (28, 128), 

the said retainer is moved out of the way so that the 
products can be freely evacuated from the second conveyor 

(8) to any suitable discharge or collecting centre.
