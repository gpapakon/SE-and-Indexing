<ABSTRACT>
The system has a switchable coupling arrangement that EPcouples a passive coupling element from a transducer output when the driving electronics is inactive so that the mechanical output impedance of the transducer has essentially no effect on the natural resonance of the bone chain in the middle ear and hence the natural residual hearing capacity for sound in air is substantially maintained. The system has at least one sound detection sensor for picking up sound signals and converting them to electrical form, an electronic signal processing unit, a power stage and at least one active electromechanical element (12,13) of an electromechanical transducer (10) for stimulating a small middle ear bone via a passive coupling element (21). A switchable coupling arrangement (22) decouples the passive element from the transducer output when the driving electronics is inactive so that the mechanical output impedance of the transducer has essentially no effect on the natural resonance of the bone chain in the middle ear and hence the natural residual hearing capacity of for sound in air is substantially maintained. Independent claims are also included for the following: an arrangement for implementing the method.
