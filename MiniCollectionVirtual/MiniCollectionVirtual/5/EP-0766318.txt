<ABSTRACT>
An object of the present invention is to 
provide an IBGT which satisfied with a reliable high 

breakdown-voltage proof characteristic and occupies 
smaller device formation region with lower power 

consumption. An n-- type semiconductor layer 38 is 
formed on a part where has tendency to cause break down, 

and an n - type semiconductor substrate 36 is formed 
underneath the n-- type semiconductor layer 38. As a 

result, the value of theoretical breakdown-voltage of the 
n-- type semiconductor layer 38 become greater than that 

of the n - type semiconductor substrate 36. Also, the n - type 
semiconductor substrate 36 having lower electric 

resistance is located underneath the n-- type 
semiconductor layer 38. Therefore, lower power 

consumption is expected because electric resistance of 
the part where determines a power consumption of the IGBT 

is decreased.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a 
semiconductor device having a planar type vertical 
element with high breakdown-voltage proof structure and a 
method thereof, more specifically, a structure of a 
semiconductor substrate which is enable to realize a 
semiconductor device having high breakdown-voltage proof 
characteristic and lower power consumption. In the past, an insulated gate bipolar 
transistor having high breakdown-voltage proof structure 
shown in Fig. 1 (hereinafter referred to as IGBT 80) is 
known as a semiconductor device having a planar type 
vertical element with high breakdown-voltage proof 
structure. The IGBT 80 is a semiconductor device which 
comprises both the characteristic of high-input impedance 
observed on a metal oxide silicon field effect 
transistors (herein after referred to as a MOSFET) and 
that of the low-saturation voltage generated by the 
bipolar transistor. A semiconductor substrate 82 of the IGBT 80  
 
comprises a p+ type conductive layer 82a, an n+ type 
layer 82b and an n- type layer 82c. A p type region 10 
is formed in the n- type layer 82c, and an n+ type region 
11 is formed in the p type region 10. A surface of the 
n- type layer 82c is covered with a gate oxidation layer 
17. The IGBT 80 is turned into on-state with supply 
of a base current of a PNP transistor generated by on-state 
of the MOSFET when a positive bias voltage is 
applied between a gate and an emitter of the IGBT 80. In the IGBT 80, occurrence of break down is 
observed adjacent to the surface of the semiconductor 
substrate even when the value of the applied voltage is 
not greater than that of a theoretical breakdown-voltage. 
This is because thickness of a depletion region on the 
surface of semiconductor substrate is thinner than that 
of a bulk due to existence of impurities in the boundary 
between the surface and an insulating layer such as an 
oxidation layer or the like. In order to prevent occurrence of break down, 
it is considered to decrease density of the impurities of 
the n- type layer 82c for increasing the value of 
theoretical breakdown-voltage for the number of decrease. 
To do that, more power consumption is expected because of 
increment of electric resistance R0 of the n- type layer 
82c. So that, in the conventional IGBT 80, either of a  
 
field limiting ring (hereinafter referred to as FLR, not 
shown) or a field plate (hereinafter referred to as FP, 
not shown) is utilized to satisfy with both a reliable 
high breakdown-voltage proof characteristic and lower 
powe
