<ABSTRACT>
In a method to determinate flows or flow rates of for example liquids to be used in medical infusion systems, use is made of optical imaging means for volume measuring. Thus the volume growth of drops during building up at an outlet, the volume of falling drops and the volume of liquid gathered in a container can be measured on line. Signals obtained from these measurements can be used to control or adjust volume flow for medical treatment or medical diagnosis for example. An apparatus to carry out such a method can be composed of devices well known per se.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention pertains to a method of measuring the flow rate of a
liquid passing through an outlet using optical imaging and photoelectric detection means and to an apparatus to
carry out this method.Such a method and apparatus are known from US 4,936,828. Therein
a camera is used to measure the volume of falling drops and the number of falling
drops per unit of time is counted in order to calculate the flow of the liquid. The
smallest measuring volume unit is thus the volume of a complete falling drop. Major
drawbacks of this known method and equipment are: its inaccuracy, its noise
sensitivity and the influence of evaporation, vibration and viscosity of the liquid on the
measuring. The method as disclosed is thus less useful for measurement of especially
small flow rates such as for e.g. medical infusion systems where often very small
quantities are involved.It is an object of the invention to provide a method and apparatus
working accurate, real time and being particularly useful for especially relatively small
flow rates.A method as introduced in the first paragraph above is according to the invention
characterized in that said means continuously measure
volume growth of a droplet of liquid during building up at the liquid outlet, said
volume growth defining directly the flow rate of said liquid. The apparatus of
the invention is defined in claim 4.Measuring he growth of droplets during growth with the use of
optical imaging and image processing means enables the determination of volume flow
rate in real time with a high accuracy and results in a flexible measuring set-up to take
into account other relevant parameters like environmental back-pressure.For optical registration use is made preferably of a detector matrix
like a CCD chip, a conventional video camera, an open RAM memory or other light
sensitive devices. Such a detector is arranged along the location of the growing drop.Although it may be supposed that the shape of the drop hanging at a
cylindrical, vertical, outlet has due to gravity a cylindrical symmetry, in a preferred
embodiment use is made of image acquisition in more directions through a growing 
drop. In this situation more acquisition devices can be applied in a known manner, but
also an image from different directions can be projected on the detector using optical
tools, like mirrors. In such an arrangement corrections can be made for asymmetry
and/or vibrations in the drop.
Hence the accuracy of the measuring method can be improved and the
consequences of the environmental
