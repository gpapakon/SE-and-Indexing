<ABSTRACT>
There is presented a cassette for storing medical, especially dental instruments, which can be inserted in a chamber (2), that can be closed in pressure-tight manner, of a device for the purpose of hygienic treatment of the instruments. The cassette contains at least one adapter (16) for mounting at least one instrument (13). At least one adapter (16) has conduction channels (33-36) for the supply of treatment media into the interior of the instruments. The adapter may comprise a control valve (32) which shuts off the conduction channels (34, 36) when the adapter (16) is not occupied by an instrument (13).

<CLAIMS>
Cassette for receiving medical, in particular
dental instruments, which for the purpose of obtaining

hygienic treatment can be placed in a chamber of a
device that cab be sealed in a pressure-tight manner

and are there subjected to a treatment process, with
the cassette (12) having at least one adaptor (16) for

holding at least one instrument (13), characterized in
that at least one adaptor (16) has line channels (33 to

36) for the purpose of feeding the treatment agents
into the interior of the instruments (13) and contains

a control valve (32) which seals the line channels (34,
36) when the adaptor (16) is not occupied by an

instrument (13).
Cassette according to claim 1, characterised
in that a plurality of adaptors (16) are provided for

different instruments (13), wherein the adaptors have
the same connection dimensions with respect to their

holding support on a housing wall (15) of the cassette.
Cassette according to claim 2, characterised
in that the adaptors (16) are held on the rear wall

(15) of the cassette (12) in such a way that they can
easily be exchanged.
Cassette according to one of the claims 1 to
3, characterised in that the cassette (12) consists of

two housing halves (12a, 12b) which are formed by
transverse division and which can be connected

together, wherein the housing half (12a) on the base
side bears the adaptor/adaptors (16) and the housing

half (12b) on the top side has guide elements (4) for
guiding the cassette (12) in the chamber (2) of the

device.
Cassette according to claim 3, characterised
in that the rear wall (15) is provided with openings

(17) through which, upon insertion of the cassette into
the chamber (2), nozzle arms (3) which are secured 

there can be engaged, wherein the openings in the
cassette for the through-passage of the nozzle arms are

sealed by a cover means (20), and a control means (20a)
for freeing the openings is associated with the cover

means.
Cassette according to claim 5, characterised
in that the cover means is a plate (20) which is held

on the rear wall (15) of the cassette (12) in a
pivotable manner and has a projection (20a) which, upon

introduction of the cassette into the chamber (2),
comes to rest against a housing edge (22) and thereby

displaces the plate for the purpose of freeing the
openings (17).
Cassette according to one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that it is made of a plastics

material which can be sterilized.
Cassette according to one of the claims 1 to
4, characterised in that one or a plurality of nozzle

arms (3) is/are secured thereon, the connecting
branches of which arms, when inserted into the chamber,

are engaged with the feed lines (47) pertaining to the
treatment agents.
