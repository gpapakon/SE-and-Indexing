<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process and
apparatus, for soldering, for example, electronic
components to a printed circuit board. More
particularly, but not exclusively, the present
invention relates to reflow soldering technology for
soldering electronic components to a printed circuit
board by applying a solder paste onto the printed
circuit board, mounting the electronic components on
the printed circuit board, and heating the printed
circuit board and the electronic components.It is known to electrically connect and
mechanically fix surface mounted devices (SMDs) to a
printed circuit board by way of reflow soldering in the
process of assembling the SMDs and printed circuit
board.In this reflow soldering process, the printed
circuit board has pads on which a solder paste (also
referred to as creamed solder) is preliminarily
printed. The SMDs are mounted on the printed circuit
board with the lead terminals thereof aligned with the
pads, and the printed circuit board is then introduced
into a reflow apparatus (or heating apparatus).The printed circuit board with attached SMDs is
transported within the reflow apparatus by means of a
conveyor and is discharged therefrom after a
predetermined period of time. In the reflow apparatus,
the printed circuit board is first preheated to
mitigate thermal shock, and is then subjected to reflow
heating (or main heating) to melt the solder. After
self-cooling (or forced cooling), the SMDs are bonded
to the printed circuit board.In this process, the lead terminals and bonding
pads are made of metals having high infrared
reflectances. Hence it is difficult directly to heat
the solder paste up to a temperature sufficient to 
achieve soldering. Therefore, heat conduction from the
printed circuit board and SMDs is used to heat the
solder paste up to the soldering temperature. Since
the melting point of the solder is typically 183°C, the
soldering temperature is generally set to between about
210°C and about 230°C, i.e. about 30°C to 50°C higher
than the melting point of the solder.Such a conventional reflow soldering apparatus
incorporates infrared radiation heaters in a preheating
zone and in a reflow zone (main heating zone) thereof,
and is designed so that the temperature profiles during
the transportation of the printed circuit board are
adjusted by controlling the outputs of the infrared
radiation heaters. See, for example, Japanese
Unexamined Patent Publications No. 62-203669 (1987) and
No. 1-254383 (1989), this latter document disclosing an apparatus
