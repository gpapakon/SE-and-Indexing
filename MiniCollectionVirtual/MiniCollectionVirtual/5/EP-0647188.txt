<ABSTRACT>
A writing unit for a cartridge fountain pen with a nib (1), a grip (2), an ink feed (4) with a spigot (3) and possibly a sleeve (5) accepting the ink feed (4), in which the ink feed (4) has lamellar collection chambers (6) and a longitudinal capillary channel (7) runs over the entire length of the ink feed (4) on the side turned towards the nib (1), is constructed to prevent ink from dripping out of the slot of the nib (1), especially when temperatures fluctuate considerably and with an ink feed (4) designed for broad script, in such a way that the longitudinal capillary channel (7) is, at least in sections, divided into two partial channels (11, 12) by a wall (10) extending longitudinally in it.

Writing unit for a cartridge pen with a 
nib (1), a handle (2) and an ink supply device (4) 

comprising a pin (3), wherein the ink supply 
device (4) comprises connecting chambers formed in 

a lamella-like manner and is penetrated by a 
capillary longitudinal slot (7) over the entire 

length thereof on the side thereof which faces the 
nib (1), and wherein the capillary longitudinal 

slot is, at least in part, subdivided into two 
part slots (11, 12) by means of a web (10) 

extending inside the longitudinal slot (7) in the 
longitudinal direction thereof,
 
characterised in that a distance approximately 

corresponding to the width of each of the part 
slots (11, 12) exists in the area below the nib 

(1) between the nib (1) and the web (10), such 
that a capillary field or a capillary space (13) 

is formed between the web (10) and the nib (1). 
Writing unit according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the web (10) is formed 

approximately centrally in the longitudinal slot 
(7) and divides the longitudinal slot (7) into 

part slots (11, 12) of approximately equal size; 
and in that the web (10) extends in the 

longitudinal slot (7) over the entire area of the  
 

collecting chamber (6), or completely through the 
entire longitudinal slot (7), ie. over the entire 

length thereof. 
Writing unit according to Claim 1 or 
Claim 2, characterised in that the web (10) 

extends from the bottom of the slot to, at most, 
the side walls which delimit the upper edges of 

the longitudinal slot (7) and are formed by the 
ink supply device (4). 
Writing device according to any one of 
Claims 1 to 3, characterised in that a sleeve (5) 

which accommodates the ink supply device (4) is 
provided; and in that, optionally, there is, 

between the web (10) and the sleeve (5) or the 
handle (2), a gap which corresponds at least to 

the width of each part slot (11, 12), such that a 
capillary field or a capillary space (14) is 

formed between the web (10) and the sleeve (5) or 
the handle (2). 
Writing device according to any one of 
Claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the web (10) 

comprises a level surface (15) at the end thereof 
which faces away from the bottom of the slot.  

 
Writing unit according to any one of 
Claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the web (10) 

comprises a surface (16), which is at least 
slightly curved, on the free end thereof which 

faces away from the bottom of the slot. 
Writing unit according to any one of 
Claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the web (10) 

and the part slots (11, 12) each comprise, in 
themselves, a substantially rect
angular cross-section. 
Writing unit according to any one of 
Claims 1 to 7, wherein the collecting chambers (6) 

end, on the side thereof which faces towards the 
nib (1), with a chamber (17) which acts as a 

regulating distance and which opens into the 
capillary longitudinal slot (7) on both sides, 

characterised in that the web (10) comprises, at 
least in the vicinity of the chamber (17) acting 

as the regulating distance and on the free end 
thereof, a groove (18) or a lower height; and in 

that the groove (18) corresponds at least to the 
width of one part slot (11, 12). 
Writing unit according to Claim 8, 
characterised in that the web (10) comprises, 

extending from the chamber (17) acting as the  
 

regulating distance in the direction of the end of 
the ink supply device (4) which faces away from 

the nib (1), at its free end, an edge recess (19) 
which extends along the web (10); in that the edge 

recess (19) of the web (10) preferably stretches 
over at least three collecting chambers (6), 

wherein the edge recess (19) extends, at the free 
end, from the side, into the strut (10) to a 

maximum of half way, and may comprise a 
substantially rectangular cross-section. 
Writing unit according to any one of 
Claims 1 to 9, wherein the ink supply device (4) 

comprises, on the end which faces away from the 
nib (1) - in front of the pin - an abutment 

surface (20) for abutment on the sleeve (5) or the 
handle (2), characterised in that the abutment 

surface (20) is distanced, by distance retainers 
(21), from the sleeve (5) or the handle (2) in 

such a manner that a capillary space or a 
capillary field (22) is formed between the 

abutment surface (20) and the sleeve (5) or the 
handle (2), into which space or field the 

longitudinal slot (7) opens; and in that the 
distance retainers (21) are formed as projections 

formed on the sleeve (5) or the handle (2).  
 
Writing unit according to any one of 
Claims 1 to 10, characterised in that three, and 

preferably six, centering parts (23) are 
associated with the inner wall of the sleeve (5) 

or the handle (2) along the periphery thereof, and 
the centring parts (23) are formed in the vicinity 

of the end of the ink supply device (4) facing 
away from the nib (1), preferably in the vicinity 

of the abutment surface (20) of the ink supply 
device (4), wherein the centring parts (23) are 

preferably formed as integral projections of the 
sleeve (5) and the longitudinal slots (7) deepen, 

preferably in a linear manner, towards the 
abutment surface up to the pin (26) which connects 

to the abutment surface (20). 
Writing unit according to any one of 
Claims 1 to 11, characterised in that the pin (26) 

has an approximately semi-circular cross-section 
with a flat surface (24) at the top; and in that 

the flat surface (24) is provided with two 
capillary slots extending parallel to one another 

over the entire pin (26).
