<ABSTRACT>
Novel molecular chimaeras produced by recombinant DNA techniques are 
described. They comprise a target tissue specific transcriptional 

regulatory sequence (TRS) linked and controlling the expression of a 
heterologous enzyme for example Varicella Zoster Virus Thymidine 

Kinase (VZV TK) gene. A molecular chimaera is packaged into a 
synthetic retroviral particle which is capable of infecting mammalian 

tissue. This in turn may be administered to a patient, and the 
TRS will be selectively transcriptionally activated in the target 

tissue (for example cancerous tissue). Administration of compounds 
which are selectively metabolised by the enzyme produce cytotoxic or 

cytostatic metabolites 
in
 
situ
 thereby selectively killing or 
arresting the growth of the target cell.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to molecular chimaeras, infective 
virions, to methods of their construction, to pharmaceutical 
formulations containing them, to their use in therapy, particularly 
virus-directed enzyme prodrug therapy, particularly in the treatment 
of cancers, more particularly in the treatment of hepatocellular 
carcinoma, and to the use of agents which can be catalysed by a 
heterologous enzyme to cytotoxic or cytostatic metabolites, such as 
purine arabinosides and substituted pyrimidines in virus-directed 
enzyme prodrug therapy. Cancer of all forms is one of the major causes of morbidity throughout 
the world. Research in the area of cancer chemotherapy has produced a 
variety of antitumour agents which have differing degrees of efficacy. 
Standard clinically used agents include adriamycin, actinomycin D, 
methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil, cis platinium, vincristine and 
vinblastine. However, these presently available antitumour agents are 
known to have various disadvantages such as toxicity to healthy cells 
and resistance of certain tumour types. Other forms of therapy such 
as surgery, are known. However it is appreciated by those skilled in 
the art that novel approaches and entities for cancer therapies are 
required. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the major malignant diseases 
in the world today; the greatest incidence being in Japan, China, 
other parts of the Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Recent evidence 
suggests that the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in Europe and 
North America is increasing. The disease is estimated to be 
responsible for or involved in up to approximately 1,250,000 deaths a 
year and as such is numerically, one of the world's major malignant 
diseases. The prognosis of HCC is always poor with the world-wide frequency rate 
almost equalling the mortality rate. After diagnosis, the median  
 
survival time is less than four months. Long-term survival, defined 
as survival longer than one year after diagnosis, is seen only 
occasionally. Most HCC patients succumb to either the complications 
of liver failure with or without massive bleeding, or to the general 
effects of a large tumour burden, with cachexia, malnutrition, 
infection and sepsis. Though distant metastases occur (up to 90% of 
patients have metastatic tumour at time of death), regional disease 
most often limits survival. Consequently, therapies directed towards 
control of hepatic tumour are appropriate although it will be 
appreciated that treatment of the metastatic disease
