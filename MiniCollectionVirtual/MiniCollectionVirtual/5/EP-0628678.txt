Floor element (1) made of PE or PP for cavity floors, 
comprising a plate (2) and a series of supporting columns 

(3) formed as a whole therewith, said supporting columns 
(3) being self-leveling. The angular plate is provided 

with stiffening means (13, 14, 15, 16) and is furthermore 
formed on the edges with trapezoidal channels (4, 5, 6, 

7). The channels (4, 5) of the two connecting sides are 
somewhat wider and deeper than the channels (6, 7) of the 

other two connecting sides, in order to provide a labyrinth 
sealing against mortar leakage.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a synthetic floor element for 
cavity floors to be poured with a hardening material which 
flows out of its own accord, such as plastified and/or 
fine-grained concrete mortar or anhydrite or the like, 
comprising a plate-shaped member supporting the mortar and 
a number of supporting columns projecting downwards therefrom 
for supporting the plate-shaped member, and thereby 
the mortar for the cavity floor to be formed, on an existing 
foundation. Such floor elements are often used for forming a double 
floor structure, for instance when this is desired for 
concealing wiring, such as wires for computers. After 
completion of the floor, these wires can simply be conveyed 
through the columns to the desired location and will 
thereafter be out of sight. It will be understood that 
forming an additional floor will not only entail an additional 
load for the existing floor, but also for the 
structure of the building concerned. It is essential, 
therefore, to keep the weight of the cavity floor to a 
minimum, but to ensure at the same time that the requirements 
of strength are met. Floor elements for cavity floors can be considered first 
of all as stay-in-place formwork plates. Although floor 
elements can be designed for load-bearing, this is not 
preferred because it will often lead to a relatively large 
weight. It would be better to form the cavity floor to be 
poured by means of the floor elements in such a way, that 
it can be self-supporting. A demand made of the floor 
elements will then be that they can hold the poured mortar 
and mould it in such a way that, after hardening, the 
layer of mortar will be able to transfer the loads excercized  
 
on it, onto the foundation. There are many embodiments of floor elements on the market, 
and many have been described in patent documents. 
Without aiming at giving a full listing, reference is made 
herein to European patent application 0,197,957, European 
patent application 0,075,372, European patent application 
0,127,037, European patent application 0,156,247, European 
patent application 0,385,876, European patent application 
0,030,415 and European patent application 0,339,537. It frequently happens that the existing floor or foundation 
is uneven, having irregularities in the range of 
0,5 - 1 cm in depth or height. In that case, it could 
happen that the floor element can either find no support 
in that spot or that it will be forced upwards. In the 
first case, there is a danger that a hardened floor will 
fracture
