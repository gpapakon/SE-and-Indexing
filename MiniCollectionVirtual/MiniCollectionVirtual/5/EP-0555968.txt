<ABSTRACT>
A block of monocrystalline silicon (1) oriented so 
as to have a body surface (2) aligned in a {110} 

crystallographic plane is selectively etched so as to 
define a groove (4) for receiving an optical waveguide 

(8, 24) and a reflecting surface (7) facing the groove 
(4). The groove (4) is aligned with a 
<
110
>
 
crystallographic axis. The reflecting surface (7) is in 

a {100} crystallographic plane. Thus the groove is 
parallel to the body surface (2) and the reflecting 

surface (7) is at 45° to the body surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical device and a 
method of manufacturing a device. Such a device provides 
accurately aligned optical paths and may be used in 
association with a micromachined structure, such as a 
silicon bridge to form a transducer, or with devices 
where optical alignment is required. Pages 186 to 189 of a philosophical dissertation by 
Rudolf A. Buser submitted to the University of Neuchatel, 
Switzerland, entitled "Theoretical and Experimental 
Investigations on Silicon Single Crystal Resonant 
Structures" disclose an arrangement for illuminating a 
resonant beam cantilever with optical radiation from an 
optical fibre. The fibre is located in a groove of V-shaped 
cross section formed by etching from a surface of 
monocrystalline silicon aligned in a {100} 
crystallographic plane. The end of the optical fibre 
faces a mirror surface formed by etching to reveal a 
transverse surface in one of the {111} crystallographic 
planes. The cantilever is formed above the mirror 
surface such that optical radiation, such as visible 
light or infrared radiation, emitted from the end of the 
fibre is reflected by the mirror surface onto the 
cantilever. This arrangement functions as a resonant 
beam transducer, for instance for measuring pressure. Because of the crystallographic alignment of the mirror 
surface with respect to the main surface of the device, 
the optical axis of the fibre intersects the mirror 
surface at an angle of 54.7°. The cantilever is arranged 
such that the reflected radiation from the mirror surface 
is incident on the cantilever. However, reflected 
radiation from the cantilever is substantially not 
reflected back along the optical axis of the fibre, so  
 
that separate means are required in order to monitor the resonant 
frequency of the cantilever, which resonant frequency is a function of the 
applied pressure or other parameter to be measured. US 5 071 213 discloses a similar arrangement for coupling an optical 
fibre to an opto-electronic device. The fibre is held in a groove of V-shaped 
cross section formed by etching a working surface of a silicon 
substrate aligned in a <100> direction. The end of the fibre is held 
adjacent a transverse surface. The transverse surface is at an angle of 
approximately 55° with respect to the working surface. Light from the 
fibre is directed towards the transverse surface, from where it is reflected 
to the opto-electronic device. According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided an 
optical
