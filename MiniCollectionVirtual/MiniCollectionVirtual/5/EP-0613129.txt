<ABSTRACT>
A writable compact disk has a plastic 
substrate (14), a recording layer (13), a reflecting layer (12), and a 

protective overcoat (11). The reflecting layer is comprised 
of gold alloyed with a metal selected from at least one 

of group of palladium, platinum, copper, nickel and 
silver. The non-gold constituent ranges from 

1 to 30 at.% of the alloy. The added metal constituent 
provides a reduced jitter parameter of retrieved 

information when the write power exceeds the optimum 
recording layer value. The reduced jitter parameter is a 

result of improved adhesion of the recording layer to the 
reflecting layer and in improved mechanical properties of 

the reflecting layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to compact 
disks and, more particularly, to the reflecting layer 
typically found on writable compact disks. Writable compact disks, i.e., compact disks 
upon which information can be written after the 
manufacture thereof, have been previously described in 
the related art. The information can be stored in the 
form of regions having optical properties determined by 
applied radiation. The information is retrieved by 
illuminating the regions and identifying differences in 
the radiation which has interacted with the disks. The 
Photo CD is an example of this type of storage medium. 
As illustrated in Fig. 1, a writable compact disk has a 
pre-grooved plastic substrate 14, a recording layer 13, 
a (metal) reflector layer 12, and a protective 
(lacquer) overcoat 11. The conventional writable 
storage medium uses a thin layer of gold as the 
reflecting layer. The gold reflecting layer exhibits 
both high stability and high reflectivity. However, 
gold is expensive and has several undesirable features 
when used as a reflecting material in a storage medium. 
By way of specific example, the gold reflecting layer 
is typically fabricated by a sputtering deposition 
process in order to achieve high product throughput. 
During higher power writing processes, such as when 
information is being stored at greater than the normal 
reading speed and the laser power must be  
 
correspondingly increased, the gold layer deforms and 
delaminates which results in cracks that are produced 
in the dye layer. (The higher power levels are used to 
expedite the writing period normally used to record 
information at the typical disk speed.) As a result of 
these phenomena, increased noise is produced in 
adjacent information tracks. In addition, the gold 
reflecting layer exhibits enhanced noise at power 
levels typically used to record at speeds which are 
greater than the normal reading speeds. This 
phenomenon is referred to as Noise at Optimum Recording 
Power (NORP) and is a serious problem in writable media 
using dyes. A need has therefore been felt for a 
reflecting layer in writable compact disk media which 
has high reflectivity and long term durability and in 
which the noise is reduced. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide an improved optical storage medium. It is a feature of the present invention to 
provide an improved reflecting layer in a writable 
optical storage medium. It is a more particular feature of the 
present invention to provide a reflecting layer
