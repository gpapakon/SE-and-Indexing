<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for pneumatically clamping and magnetically 
biasing magnetic media during anhysteretic transfer 

comprises a housing (64, 74, 76, 80, 82, 88, 90, 96, 98) 
which encloses a pair of pneumatic plenums (112) connected 

to a source of high pressure air (70, 72, 73) and a pair of 
arrays (106) of biasing magnets (108); so that, air from the 

plenums flows between the magnets and bands (57) at the 
edges of the media to provide intimate contact of the media 

during anhysteretic transfer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns pneumatic clamps and magnetic
bias arrays useful for bringing a master magnetic recording
medium into intimate contact with a slave magnetic recording
medium and for magnetically biasing the contacting media to
cause anhysteretic transfer of information from the master
to the slave. More particularly, the invention concerns a
combined pneumatic clamp and magnetic bias array useful for
anhysteretically recording onto bands along the edges of an
elongated web of photographic film including a magnetic
recording medium; so that, information may be transferred
from a master magnetic medium onto the film in areas outside
those intended for photographic images.Conventional magnetic recording requires a stationary
recording head which makes contact with a moving surface of
a magnetic medium, which may be in web, disk or drum form.
Because of the tendency of such heads to abrade the magnetic
medium, at least the surface layer of the magnetic medium
generally is made from a durable material selected to resist
abrasion. In recent years, photographic films have been
developed which include on one side of a base material,
various layers of photosensitive materials; and on the other
side, a thin, virtually transparent layer of magnetic
medium. The magnetic medium can be used, for example,
during manufacture of the film to record information related
to the film's characteristics; during use of the film in the
camera to enable the camera to read and adjust itself in
response to previously recorded information and/or to record
information about camera settings and scene characteristics;
and during processing or developing of the film to enable
the processing equipment to read previously recorded 
information and adjust the processing parameters
accordingly. However, because of the presence of the
magnetic medium in a photographic film, the properties of
the surface layer of the magnetic medium are chosen more for
their photographic suitabilities than for their resistance
to the sort of abrasion which can occur due to contact with
a stationary recording head in a conventional recording
process. Any abrasion on the film surface must be avoided
since it would degrade the optical properties of the film
and thereby prevent capture and reproduction of high quality
images. As a result, if conventional recording apparatus
were used to record to the magnetic recording medium on such
a film, there would be a danger that the portion of the film
containing the magnetic medium would be damaged due to
abrasion.

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus (14) for pneumatically clamping a portion of
at least one edge (58) of an elongated web (56) of

photographic film, the film including a slave magnetic
recording medium and having a centerline, into intimate

contact with a master magnetic recording medium (54); and
for magnetically biasing the contacting media to cause

anhysteretic transfer of information from the master medium
to a band (57) along an edge of the film as the band moves

past the apparatus while in intimate contact with the master
medium, the apparatus including a housing

(64,74,76,80,82,88,90,96,98) having a pneumatic engagement
surface;


means (12) for mounting the housing with the engagement
surface closely facing a zone of the intimate contact

between the film and the master recording medium;
a pneumatic plenum (110,112) within the housing, the
plenum being opened through the engagement surface to face

the film between the centerline and the band along the edge
of the film, the plenum further being elongated in a

direction parallel to the edge of the film and means (70-73)
for directing a flow of gas into the pneumatic plenum; and
an array (106) of alternatingly polarized permanent
magnets (108) situated in side by side relationship, each

magnet having a pole face with a width extending
substantially across the band along the edge of the film,

each pole face facing the band in the zone of intimate
contact, the array being supported by the housing and

further being elongated in a direction essentially parallel
to the edge of the film, whereby gas flowing from the plenum

will pass between the pole faces and the band along the edge
of the film in the zone of intimate contact to clamp the

band into intimate contact with the master medium, thereby 
enabling alternating magnetic fields from the array to cause

the anhysteretic transfer of information from the master
medium to the band along the edge of the film.
Apparatus according to Claim 1, further including
a side surface (88,90) on the housing; the array being

positioned between the plenum and the side surface; and the
side surface terminating at an edge (94) extending beyond

the engagement surface and facing the band along the edge of
the film.
Apparatus according to Claim 2, wherein the side surface
is comprised in a side plate including the edge facing the

band, further including means (92) for permitting
movement of the side plate relative to the housing toward or

away from the band along the edge of the film, thereby to
control the flow area for the gas.
Apparatus according to Claim 1, further including
front and back plates (96,98) mounted on the housing and

extended transverse to the edge of the film, the front and
back plates each having an edge (102) extending beyond the

engagement surface and facing the film; and means (102) for
permitting movement of the front and back plates toward or

away from the film, thereby to control the flow area for the
gas.
Apparatus according to Claim 1, further
including

   a further pneumatic plenum within the housing, the
further plenum being opened through the engagement surface

to face the film between the centerline and a further band
along an opposite edge of the film, the further plenum also

being elongated in a direction parallel to the opposite edge
of the film; means for directing a flow of gas into the

further pneumatic plenum; and a further array of
alternatingly polarized permanent magnets situated in side

by side relationship, each magnet having a pole face facing 
the further band along the opposite edge of the film in the

zone of intimate contact, the further array being supported
by the housing and also being elongated in a direction

parallel to the opposite edge of the film, whereby gas
flowing from the further plenum will pass between the

further array and the further band along the opposite edge
of the film in the zone of intimate contact to clamp the

further band into intimate contact with the master medium,
thereby enabling alternating magnetic fields from the

further array to cause the anhysteretic transfer of
information from the master medium to the further band along

the opposite edge of the film.
Apparatus according to Claim 1, further including
means (60-64), connected between the means for mounting and

the housing, for moving the housing toward or away from the
zone of intimate contact.
Apparatus according to Claim 6, wherein the means for
moving the housing is centered on the array.
