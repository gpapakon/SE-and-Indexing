<ABSTRACT>
Polymer compositions containing a polyphenylene ether-polyolefin 
copolymer are obtained by reactive melt mixing 

olefin-(alkyl)acrylic acid copolymer with a polyphenylene 
ether and a carboxylic anhydride. The compositions are used 

in many commercial applications requiring high temperature 
resistance including formation of films, fibers and molded 

articles with excellent surface appearance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to novel polyphenylene 
ether-polyethylene copolymer blends prepared by reactive melt 
blending of polyphenylene ether or an ester end-capped 
polyphenylene ether with an ethylene-acrylic acid copolymer. The polyphenylene ether resins (PPE) constitute a family 
of high performance engineering thermoplastics possessing 
outstanding properties, such as relatively high melt 
viscosities and softening points, which make them useful for 
many commercial applications. More precisely, PPE resins are 
suitable for many commercial applications requiring high 
temperature resistance and including formation of films and 
molded articles. Among the most important characteristics of PPE resins 
are excellent hydrolytic stability, dimensional stability, 
toughness, heat resistance and dielectric properties. On the other hand, PPE resins, although displaying the 
above-mentioned desirable properties, are also endowed with 
certain unsatisfactory properties which render them 
undesirable for many commercial uses. For example, films and  
 
fibers can be formed from polyphenylene ether resins on a 
commercial scale using solution techniques but melt processing 
is commercially limited because of the high temperatures 
required to soften the PPE resins which cause instability and 
changes in the polymer structure. Further, PPE polymers tend 
to degrade and to grow dark during melt processing. Moreover, PPE resins are brittle due to their poor impact 
strength and limited in tensile properties and they are 
endowed with poor solvent resistance as well, and therefore 
cannot be used in applications, such as automotive 
applications where the parts will be exposed to chemicals, 
such as gasoline, grease and detergents. Therefore, there is 
a continuing search for improving the deficient 
characteristics of PPE particularly workability and solvent 
resistance. In order to improve molding properties and impact 
strength, polyblends of polyphenylene ether resins with 
styrene resins have been employed. Thus U.S. 3,363,435 
discloses that PPE can be mixed with polystyrene (PS) in all 
proportions to give blends with a good combination of 
properties and enhanced molding properties. However, the 
range of application of PPE-PS blends is still limited due to 
poor solvent resistance, i.e., they are unsuitable in fields 
requiring resistance to oils and gasoline. In order to overcome the poor solvent resistance of PPE a 
number of blend compositions of polyolefins and PPE have been  
 
proposed.
