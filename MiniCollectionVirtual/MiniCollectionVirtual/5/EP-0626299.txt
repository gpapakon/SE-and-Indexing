<ABSTRACT>
A device for detecting the position of a vehicle (2) which can be moved along a rail (1) consists of a magnetic tape (7) which is arranged along the rail (1) and has magnetization areas running transversely with respect to the longitudinal direction of the rail (1) and an associated read head (7) which is mounted on the vehicle and has a downstream evaluation module (8). Here, a simple and reliably operating module is obtained if the magnetization areas of the magnetic tape are arranged in a binary absolute encoding according to a convolution code.

<CLAIMS>
A device for determining the position of a 
vehicle (2) which can move on a rail (1), consisting of a 

magnetic strip (7) disposed along the rail (1) and having 
magnetisation regions extending transversely to the 

longitudinal direction of the rail (1), and an associated 
reading head (11) attached to the vehicle (2) with an 

evaluation component (8) connected downstream, characterised 
in that the magnetisation regions of the magnetic strip (7) 

are arranged in a binary absolute coding according to a 
convolution code with error correction. 
A device according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the magnetic strip (7) consists of a magnetisable, 

flexible plastic section.
