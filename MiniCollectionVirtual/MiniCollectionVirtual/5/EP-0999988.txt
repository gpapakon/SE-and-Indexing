<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a box made of heat insulating material (1, 26), refrigerated or not, capable of being built-in or set on the ground, for prolonged storage between 4 and 6  DEG C of household refuse and all organic waste likely to deteriorate at ambient temperature, while awaiting to be collected by the refuse collecting services. The box is provided: with orifices (13, 35) vertical to the containers for depositing refuse; an access door for removing the containers. The collector enables to prevent all proliferation of odours, bacteria, rodents to preserve hygienic conditions, and also to prevent domestic animals from littering the ground with the refuse bin contents: so as to facilitate the working conditions of the refuse collecting personnel and all persons who in the course of their work come in contact with or handle such refuse; and to enhance environmental aesthetics of "collecting points". The isothermal collector capable of being built into the ground is further provided with a remote-control hydraulic lift system (16, 20, 21). In its buried position only 4 flexible ducts required for depositing refuse are above ground level, the built-in collector floor is designed to receive the surrounding ground covering thereby providing perfect integration with any urban site. Its design enabling a very discreet installation in all public locations, provides, in its non-refrigerated version, for selective collection of non-alterable refuse.
