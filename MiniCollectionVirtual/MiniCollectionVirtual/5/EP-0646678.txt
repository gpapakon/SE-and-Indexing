<ABSTRACT>
Prefabricated sanitary construction elements for attaching sanitary installations to the room wall are intended to form an aesthetically pleasing cladding and to be of a dimensionally and positionally stable design. Instead of a frame structure, use is made, according to the invention, of a three-dimensional structure which is produced from a foamed plastic, with inserted reinforcements and cavities made therein, and can be clamped on the room wall by means of anchor screws such that no buckling can take place; a specially designed spacer sleeve is provided for this purpose.

A prefabricated sanitary building block for structurally
connecting frontally provided sanitary appliances (W,T,B), such

as washbasins (W), toilet bowls (T), bidets (B) and the like,
to/in a room wall (R) and to pipes (L) which are preferably laid

adjacent to the room wall (R) and serve for the required supply

of fresh water and discharge of waste water, components of the
sanitary appliances (W,T,B), such as cisterns (K) for the toilet

bowls (T) and the like, which can be sunk in the sanitary
building block (S), able to be tiled and/or painted after its

installation, being provided in such a way that a cutout (3) in
the sanitary building block (S) required for their operation also

allows the monitoring and repair of the building components
accommodated in the sanitary building block (S), furthermore

holding elements (7) for the attachment of the sanitary
appliances (W,T,B) to the sanitary building block (S) and

fastening elements (11) for connecting the sanitary building
block (S) to the room wall (R) and/or to another sanitary

building block (S) being provided in the sanitary building block
(S) in such a way that they do not protrude from the outer

contour of the sanitary building block (S), and furthermore all
the appliances (W,T,B) and holding elements (7) being embedded

in a filling body (10) made of foamed plastic, and to be precise
in such a way that the pipe connections required for the

appliances (W,T,B) are at most flush with the outer contour of
the sanitary building block (S),
characterized in that
(a) functionally unused spatial compartments of the filling body
(10) are formed as hollow spaces (15),
(b) the frontal connecting regions, adjoining the hollow spaces
(15), of the filling body (10) for the sanitary appliances 

(W,T,B) and/or the room wall (R) are at least partly provided
with reinforcements (9) and
(c) the fastening elements (11) are in each case attached, by an
adjustable distance sleeve (11d) or the like, to the room wall

(R) or to a further sanitary building block (S) in such a way
that irregularities of the mutually contacting surfaces of the

sanitary building blocks (S) and/or of the room wall (R) are
compensated for and the spatial orientation of the sanitary

building block (S) is ensured.
A sanitary building block according to Claim 1,

characterized in that
 it is designed as a building-block module
and optionally one or more of the sanitary appliances (W,T,B) are

provided.
A sanitary building block according to Claim 1 or 2,

characterized in that
 the required constructional and functional
elements are captively encased with foamed plastic.
A sanitary building block according to Claim 1 or 2,

characterized in that
 spaces for the required constructional and
functional elements are preformed in the filling body (10) or

formed by machining and the said elements are exchangeably
provided in the spaces.
A sanitary building block according to one of Claims 1 to
4, 
characterized in that
 it is surrounded at least partly by a
covering cladding (16) which has openings for the regions to

A sanitary building block according to Claim 5,

characterized in that
 a further cladding (16) of similar
configuration, which extends up to the room ceiling (D) and

serves as a casing for the required pipes (L), can be placed on
the sanitary building block (S). 
A sanitary building block according to Claim 5 or 6,

characterized in that
 the cladding (16) is provided at least
partly with a reinforcement (9).
A sanitary building block according to one of Claims 1 to
7, 
characterized in that
 the reinforcement (9) consists of wood
boards or particle boards.
A sanitary building block according to one of Claims 1 to
8, 
characterized in that
 the reinforcements (9) are surrounded
by the plastic on all sides.
A sanitary building block according to one of Claims 1 to
9, 
characterized in that
 it can be fastened to the room wall (R)
by anchor screw bolts (11g), each of which is surrounded

concentrically by the distance sleeve (11d).
A sanitary building block according to Claim 10,

characterized in that
 the distance sleeve (11d) is mounted in the
sanitary building block (S) and is axially movable by means of

a threaded connection (11c,11e).
