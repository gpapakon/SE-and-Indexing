<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the use of IRF-1 or nucleic acids containing the coding information 
for IRF-1 for the reversal of the phenotype of transformed cells. Nucleic acids coding for 

IRF-1 can be used as tumor suppressor genes in the gene therapy of cancer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of the transcription factor interferon regulatory
factor-1 (IRF-1) or nucleic acid molecules containing the coding information for IRF-1
for the manufacture of a pharmaceutical composition to reverse the phenotype of tumor cells or cells which show a transformed phenotype.Interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), a transcriptional activator, and IRF-2, its antagonistic
repressor, have been identified as regulators of type I interferon (IFN) and IFN-inducible
genes. It has been shown previously that IRF-1 manifests anti-oncogenic activity
in NIH 3T3 cells which are transformed by overexpression of IRF-2. In fact, when the IRF-2
gene was overexpressed in NIH 3T3 cells, the cells became transformed and displayed
enhanced tumorigenicity in nude mice. However, this transformed phenotype was reversed
by concomitant overexpression of the IRF-1 gene (Harada et al., Science259, 971-974,
1993). It has been shown that the human IRF-1 gene maps to chromosome 5q31.1, a region
frequently deleted in patients with leukemia or preleukemic myelodysplastic syndromes
(Willman et al., Science259, 968-971, 1993).In the present invention, it has surprisingly been found that the reversal of the transformed
phenotype by IRF-1 is not restricted to cells transformed by its natural antagonist,
IRF-2, but can also be achieved in cells expressing oncogenes. So, this invention makes it
possible to revert the transformed phenotype in tumor cells more generally. IRF-1 and
nucleic acids coding for IRF-1 can be applied in the therapy of cancer, especially in gene
therapy.Thus, the present invention is related to the use of a nucleic acid containing the coding
information for interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) or a biologically active variant or
fragment thereof for the manufacture of a pharmaceutical composition for the treatment of a disease treatable by reversal of the phenotype of transformed cells, which express the oncogene c.myc or fos B
. Transformed cells or tumor cells are cells characterized by
significant changes in their growth properties as compared to normal cells (Darnell et al.,
Molecular Cell Biology, Scientific American Books, Inc., New York, 1986, pp. 1039-1046).
It is further preferred that said cells are
characterized by lack or shortage of tumor suppressor gene expression. Advantageously,
said nucleic acid is incorporated into an expression vector. This can be, for example, a viral
vector, preferably a retroviral vector, e.g. pDG. A preferred embodiment of the present
