<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a copper-clad 
laminate characterized in that an electrolytic copper 

foil (1) on the glossy surface side (1a) of which a copper 
electrodeposit (2) is formed, is bonded at its glossy 

surface side (1a) to one side or each of both sides of a 
substrate (3), which has a fine-pitch wiring (circuit) 

pattern and exhibits a high etching factor. The 
present invention further provides a copper-clad 

laminate which can be suitably employed in the 
production of such a printed wiring board.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a copper-clad 
laminate and a printed wiring board. More 
particularly, the present invention is concerned with a 
printed wiring board having a fine-pitch wiring 
(circuit) pattern and exhibiting a high etching factor, 
and further concerned with a copper-clad laminate which 
can be suitably employed in the production of such a 
printed wiring board. The copper-clad laminate for use in the 
production of a printed wiring board is mainly obtained 
by bonding a copper foil as a conductive layer to one 
side or each of both sides of a substrate made from a 
glass-reinforced epoxy resin material or the like. 
This copper foil forms a wiring pattern by etching, 
etc. The copper foil and the substrate are bonded 
together under pressure while heating with or without 
an adhesive interposed therebetween. As such a copper foil, an electrolytically 
produced copper foil is generally employed. The 
electrolytic copper foil is obtained by separating a 
copper foil deposited on a drum. One side (glossy  
 
surface) of the copper foil which has been detached 
from the drum and on which electrodeposition has 
started is relatively smooth, while the other side 
(rough surface) of the copper foil on which 
electrodeposition has ended is generally rough. In the 
sectional texture of the electrolytic copper foil, the 
texture on the glossy surface side, i.e., the texture 
in the initial stage of electrodeposition exhibits 
random orientation of small crystal particles, and with 
the progress of electrodeposition the crystal texture 
comes to have greater orientation in the direction of 
the electrodeposition, with the crystal particle size 
becoming greater. In the conventional copper-clad 
laminates, the copper foil is bonded on its rough 
surface side to the substrate for the reasons of 
greater bonding strength and easier handling. In order 
to improve the strength of peeling from the substrate, 
copper particles of 0.2 to 3.5 µm are applied to the 
rough surface of the copper foil. Formation of a wiring pattern by etching the 
above-mentioned copper-clad laminate has inevitably 
been accompanied by the problem that the etching factor 
becomes small due to the effects of crystal orientation 
and crystal grain boundary. The etching factor being small means that sharp 
edges and desirable etching orientation cannot be  
 
obtained. An explanatory view of the etching factor is 
shown in Fig. 1. When the etching factor is small, the top is 
narrow and the bottom is broad. Thus, the
