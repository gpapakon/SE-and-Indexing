<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an anode furnace for receiving blister 
copper and refining the same to produce copper of higher 

quality, said anode furnace comprising:
 

a cylindrical furnace body (21) having a shell portion (21b) 
and a pair of end plates (21a) mounted on opposite ends 

thereof, said furnace body (21) having an axis and being 
arranged rotatably with said axis being extended horizontally;

 
heating means (26) attached to said furnace body (21) for 

maintaining an interior of the furnace at elevated temperature; 
and

 
a drive assembly (25) attached to said furnace body (21) for 

rotating said furnace body (21) between a blister copper-receiving 
position and a refining position,

 
said shell portion (21b) having an opening (30) for receiving 

blister copper, said opening (30) extending circumferentially 
of said shell portion (21b) and arranged such that said opening 

(30) is directed upwards both in said blister copper-receiving 
position and said refining position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an anode furnace
for receiving blister copper and refining the same
to produce copper of higher quality.As schematically depicted in Figs. 1 and 2, a
copper smelting apparatus comprised of a plurality of
furnaces is hitherto known. The smelting apparatus
comprises a smelting furnace 1 for melting and oxidizing
the copper concentrates supplied together with oxygen-enriched
air, to produce a mixture of matte M and slag
S, a separating furnace 2 for separating the matte M
from the slag S, a converter or converting furnace 3 for
oxidizing the separated matte M into blister copper C
and slag, and anode furnaces 4 and 4 for refining the
blister copper C thus obtained to produce copper of
higher purity. In each of the smelting furnace 1 and the
converting furnace 3, a lance 5 composed of a double-pipe
structure is inserted through the furnace roof and
attached thereto for vertical movement. Copper concentrates,
oxygen-enriched air, flux and so on are supplied
into each furnace through the lance 5. The separating
furnace 2 is an electric furnace, which is equipped with
electrodes 6.As shown in Fig. 1, the smelting furnace 1, the
separating furnace 2 and the converting furnace 3 are
arranged so as to have different elevations in the descending
order, and are connected in series through
launder 7A and 7B, so that the melt is tapped via gravitation
through these launders 7A and 7B.The blister copper C produced continuously in
the converting furnace 3 is stored temporarily in a holding
furnace 8, and then received in a ladle 9, which is
conveyed by means of a crane 10 to the anode furnaces
4, and the blister copper C is poured thereinto through
the inlet formed in the top wall.In the smelting apparatus as described above,
although the operations up to the converting furnace 3
are carried out continuously, the refining operations at
the anode furnaces 4 are conducted in batches. Therefore,
the blister copper C produced in the converting furnace
3 must be stored temporarily in the holding furnace
8. Accordingly, the installation of the holding furnace 8
is required. In addition, the ladle, the crane and so on
are required in order to transport the blister copper C
from the holding furnace 8 to the anode furnaces 4. Furthermore,
a large amount of energy has been required
to keep the temperature of the blister copper C high
enough during these operations. As a result, the expenses
for the installation of the facilities as well as the
running costs are high, and the opportunities for the
