<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns (+)-norcisapride, and its pharmaceutically acceptable
acid additions salts, a process for preparing said compound, and its use for the
manufacture of a medicament for treating gastro-intestinal disorders while avoiding
central nervous system effects.Cisapride is a widely used gastrokinetic commercially known as "Prepulsidâ„¢". It is
currently used primarily to treat gastro-esophagal reflux disease. This disease is
characterized as the backward flow of the stomach contents into the esophagus. Other
factors in the pathogenesis of the disease are delayed gastric emptying, insufficient
esophageal clearing due to impaired peristalsis and the corrosive nature of the reflux
material which can damage the esophageal mucosa.Because of its activity as a prokinetic agent, cisapride may also be useful to treat
dyspepsia, gastroparesis, constipation, postoperative ileus, and intestinal pseudo-obstruction.Cisapride is metabolized mainly via the enzyme cytochrome P 450 3A4. As a result of
extensive metabolization, unchanged cisapride accounts for less than 10% of urinary
and fecal recovery following oral administration. The principal metabolite, found in
plasma, feces and urine, described by Meuldermans W. et al. in Drug Metab. Dispos.
16(3) : 410-419, 1988, is named "norcisapride" and is a racemic mixture of two
enantiomers.Racemic norcisapride is also disclosed in EP-A-0,076,530, published on 13 April 1983,
as compound 211 having gastro-intestinal stimulating properties.(+)-Norcisapride is one of the optical stereoisomers. The full chemical name is
(+)-4-amino-5-chloro-N-(3-methoxy-4-piperidinyl)-2-methoxybenzamide, hereinafter
referred to as "(+)-norcisapride". The term "(+)-norcisapride" and particularly the term
"optically pure (+)-norcisapride" encompasses the (+)-stereoisomer which is
substantially free of its (-)-stereoisomer.WO 96/40133 teaches the use of (-)-norcisapride for treating digestive tract disorders,
in particular for treating gastro-oesophageal reflux disease while substantially reducing
adverse effects associated with the administration of racemic cisapride. The said 
document goes on to mention that optically pure (-)-norcisapride would be an effective
antiemetic agent, useful as an adjunctive therapy in cancer treatment to alleviate nausea
and vomiting induced by chemo- or radiotherapeutics.
WO-94/12494 discloses the use of known dimethylbenzofurans and dimethylbenzopyrans
as 5HT3-antagonists. FR-2,717,174 discloses piperidinoalkyl
