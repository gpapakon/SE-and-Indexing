<ABSTRACT>
A loudspeaker has a yoke base (11a), a center pole (10) formed 
on the yoke base (11a), an annular magnet mounted (13) on the 

yoke base (11a), and an annular plate (14) mounted on the 
magnet (13) so as to form a gap (G) between an inside wall 

thereof and an outer wall of the center pole (10). A cap (20) 
made of resin and having a cylindrical portion (20a) is 

securely mounted on the top of the center pole (10). The 
cylindrical portion (20a) is disposed in the gap (G). A 

plurality of projections (21) is formed on the cylindrical 
portion (20a), each of which extends axially. A voice coil 

bobbin (16) is disposed between the projections (21) and the 
inside wall of the annular plate (14).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a structure for supporting a 
vibrating system of a loudspeaker, and more particularly to a 
supporting structure for a voice coil bobbin having a voice 
coil wound thereon for vibrating a diaphragm by the magnetic 
reaction between the voice coil and a magnet. In a loudspeaker for a car stereo, the place for disposing the 
loudspeaker is limited to a small space so that it is desired 
to have a loudspeaker which has a small thickness. Japanese Patent Publication 55-42559 discloses a loudspeaker 
structure which is designed with a reduced thickness. Fig. 20 
shows the loudspeaker. The loudspeaker has a center pole 2 
formed on a yoke and an annular magnet 1, thereby forming a 
magnetic circuit. A voice coil bobbin 4 provided with a voice 
coil 3 thereon is disposed in a magnetic gap formed between 
the center pole 2 and the magnet 1. An inner edge of a 
diaphragm 5 is secured to the voice coil bobbin 4 at the outer 
periphery thereof. On the inner periphery of the voice coil 
bobbin 4, a bearing 6 is provided and slidably mounted along 
the outer periphery of the center pole 2. Thus, in such a 
loudspeaker, a damper is omitted which is conventionally 
provided for supporting the coil bobbin 4. When supplied with an audio current, the voice coil 3 
generates a magnetic force, which moves the voice coil 
bobbin 4 itself in the axial direction. The diaphragm 5 is 
thus caused to vibrate to produce sound waves. The voice coil 
bobbin 4 is guided along the center pole 2 through the  
 
bearing 6 so that the axial movement of the coil bobbin is 
stabilized. A loudspeaker having such a structure is advantageous in that 
the thickness of the loudspeaker is reduced because of the 
elimination of a damper. However, the contact area between the 
bearing 6 and the center pole 2 is considerably large. Hence, 
when reciprocating on the center pole 2, the bearing 6 makes 
rubbing noises, causing a deterioration of quality of sound. An object of the present invention is to provide a loudspeaker 
which has a structure with a small thickness and without 
deteriorating the sound quality of the loudspeaker. According to the present invention, there is provided a 
structure for supporting a vibrating system of a loudspeaker 
having a yoke base, a center pole formed on the yoke base, an 
annular magnet mounted on the yoke base, and an annular plate 
mounted on the magnet so as to form a gap between an inside 
wall thereof and an outer wall of the center pole. The structure comprises a cap

loudspeaker having a yoke base (11a), a center pole (10) 

formed on the yoke base (11a), an annular magnet (13) 
mounted on the yoke base (11a), and an annular plate (14) 

mounted on the magnet (13) so as to form a gap (G) between 
an inside wall thereof and an outer wall of the center 

pole (10), comprising: 

a cap (20, 22) made of resin, having a cylindrical 
portion (20a, 22a), and securely mounted on the top of 

the center pole (10) so that the cylindrical 
portion (20a, 22a) is disposed in the gap (G); 
guide means (21, 23) provided on the cylindrical 
portion (20a, 22a) of the cap (20, 22); and 
a coil bobbin (16) disposed between the guide 
means (21, 23) and the inside wall of the annular 

plate (14).

wherein the guide means (21) comprise a plurality of 

projections (21), each of which extends axially of the 
cap (20). 
The structure according to claim 2, 
wherein each of the projections (21) has a triangular 

shape in cross-section. 
The structure according to claim 1, 
wherein the guide means (23) comprise an outside 

cylindrical portion (23) formed by bending a cylindrical 
portion of the cap (22) upwardly at a lower portion 

thereof.
