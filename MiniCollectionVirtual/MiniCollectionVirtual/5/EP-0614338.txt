Process for the treatment of proteinaceous matter 
comprising a stage involving the reaction of such matter with 

hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) in an acid medium produced by a 
strong inorganic acid, the HMT being transformed in situ into 

formaldehyde in the aforesaid reaction. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
HMT is used in the form of powder or aqueous solution. 
Process according to one of claims 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the proteinaceous matter comprises any protein suitable 

to be used for animal feed, more particularly for ruminants, in 
particular vegetable or animal protein, for example oilcake from 

soya, rapeseed, groundnuts, field beans, peas, and other 
vegetable matter consumable by animals. 
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the pH of the treated product measured 

conventionally in an aqueous suspension at a concentration of 10% 
by weight is between 2 and 6, preferably between approximately 

4.5 and 5.5. 
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that an intimate contact is established between 

the proteinaceous substrate and the reagents, for example by 
grinding of the aforesaid substrates to a particle size of 0.1 

to 2 mm, in particular to approximately 0.2 to 0.5 mm.  
 
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the acid medium is produced by hydrochloric 

acid. 
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the quantity of HMT is determined by 

reference to the quantity of formaldehyde which must be supplied 
in situ to protect the proteins. 
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that, as a function of the dry matter weight of 

the proteinaceous substrate, the quantity of HMT, also expressed 
as dry weight, is between 0.2 and 2%, and preferably between 0.3 

and 1% by weight, that is between 0.5 and 4% of the concentration 
of crude proteins. 
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that 
the HMT is in the form of an aqueous 
solution simultaneously containing the strong inorganic acid 

intended for treatment of the proteinaceous substrate. 
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that the reaction is carried out at a 

temperature lower than the boiling point of the reaction medium, 
advantageously between 50 and 70Â°C. 
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 10, 
characterized in that the reaction product is subjected to 

maturation, for example for 1 to 4 weeks in a closed container 
allowing the in situ diffusion of formaldehyde.
