<ABSTRACT>
The folded box has side wall flaps (18,19) and cover wall side flaps (24,25), which are connected to each other via longitudinal full-length narrow strips of adhesive (37,38,39,40), preferably two parallel strips. The adhesive strips are applied by moving the box material relative to especially adhesive nozzles. The material is in contact with the nozzles, and the application period is adjusted by interrupting the adhesive supply to the nozzles.

Process for producing hinge-lid boxes for
cigarettes, comprising a box part (12) and lid (13),

which respectively have side tabs (18, 19) and lid side
tabs (24, 25) which are connected to one another by

gluing and are intended for forming side walls of the
box part (12) and of the lid (13), the glue being

applied in strip form to the side tabs (18, 19; 24, 25)
and the latter then being connected to one another,


characterized by
 the following features:

a) in each case a plurality of parallel,
longitudinally running, continuous, narrow strips

of glue (37, 38) and (39, 40) are respectively
applied to the outer side tabs (19) and lid side

tabs (25),
b) the strips of glue (37, 38; 39, 40) are
transferred from the glue nozzles (41, 42) to the

side tabs (19) and lid side tabs (25) as the
hinge-lid box is transported relative to said glue

nozzles,
c) the side tabs (19) and lid side tabs (25) butt
against the glue nozzles (41, 42) at least during

the transfer of the glue, such that the glue is
transferred by contact of the side tabs (19) and

lid side tabs (25) with mouths of the glue nozzles
(41, 42),
d) the side tabs (19) and the lid side tabs (25), in
the region of the glue nozzles (41, 42), are 

located above the glue nozzles (41, 42) such that
the side tabs (19) and lid side tabs (25) have

their downwardly directed inner side butting
against the glue nozzles (41, 42).
Process according to Claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 the duration of the glue transfer to the packaging
material butting against the glue nozzles (41, 42) is

controlled by the feed of glue to the glue nozzles (41,
42) being interrupted, in particular with the conveying

speed for the packaging material being taken into
account.
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
in that
, in order to influence the applications of glue
transferred to the packaging material by the glue

nozzles (41, 42), the pressure acting on the glue can
be adjusted, in particular such that a relatively low

pressure is exerted on the glue in the case of the
relatively low conveying speed of the packaging

material and a relatively high pressure is exerted on
the glue in the case of a relatively high conveying

speed of said material.
Process according to Claim 1 or one of the further
claims, 
characterized in that
, when a packaging machine
or the gluing operation is started up, glue is fed to

the glue-applying element or the glue nozzles (41, 42)
in a pulsed, intermittent manner until a minimum speed

of the packaging material is reached, this feeding
operation being carried out preferably by pulsed or

intermittent opening and closing of a valve (47) or of
a shut-off element in a glue line (45, 46) leading to

the glue nozzles (41, 42).
Process according to Claim 1 or one of the further
claims, 
characterized in that
 the hinge-lid boxes
and/or the blanks thereof and/or the side tabs (19)

and/or lid side tabs (25) butt against the glue nozzles 
(41, 42) under pressure, preferably under elastic

pressure, at least during the transfer of glue in order
to form the strips of glue (37. .40).
Apparatus for carrying out the process according
to one of Claims 1 to 5, namely for producing hinge-lid

boxes for cigarettes, having a glue assembly (36) for
applying glue in strip form to regions of the hinge-lid

box, it being possible for not yet finished hinge-lid
boxes (10) to be conveyed along a pack conveyor path

(30) through the glue assembly (36), 
characterized by

the following features:

a) the glue assembly (36) has glue dispensers, namely
a plurality of adjacent glue nozzles (41, 42) with

an upwardly directed mouth,
b) folding tabs, namely outer side tabs (19) directed
in a horizontal plane and lid side tabs (25) of

the hinge-lid box (10), butt against the mouths of
the glue nozzles 
(41, 42) as the hinge-lid box is
transported in the region of the glue assembly

(36).
Apparatus according to Claim 6, 
characterized in
that
 the glue assembly (36), on both sides of the pack
conveyor path (30), has in each case two glue nozzles

(41, 42) which are spaced apart one beside the other,
the underside of the side tabs (19) and lid side tabs

(25) butting against the mouths of the glue nozzles
(41, 42).
Apparatus according to Claim 7, 
characterized in
that
 each glue nozzle (41, 42) is connected to an
individual glue feed, namely to a glue line (45, 46),

and 
in that
 it is possible for each glue nozzle (41,
42) to be disengaged individually from the glue feed.
Apparatus according to Claim 6 or one of the
further claims, 
characterized in that
 the side tabs
(19) and/or lid side tabs (25) can be pressed against 

the mouths of the glue nozzles (41, 42) by
pressure-exerting elements, in particular by elongate,

elastic pressure-exerting plates (48, 49), which butt
with elastic pressure against that side of the blanks

which is located opposite the glue nozzles (41, 42).
Apparatus according to Claim 9 or one of the
further claims, 
characterized in that
 the elongate
pressure-exerting plates (48, 49) slope down at an

acute angle in the conveying direction of the hinge-lid
boxes (10), such that the side tabs (19) and/or lid

side tabs (25) can be conveyed into an acute angle
formed by the pressure-exerting plates (48, 49).
Apparatus according to Claim 9, 
characterized in
that
 the pressure-exerting elements, namely pressure-exerting
plates (48, 49), can be moved out of the

pressure-exerting position into a drawn-back, raised
position, preferably by a shaft (53), to which the

pressure-exerting plates (48, 49) are connected, being
rotated.
Apparatus according to Claim 6 or one of the
further claims, 
characterized in that
 the glue nozzles
(41, 42) can be closed from the outside by closure

elements, in particular by closure members (55) with a
sealing member (56).
Apparatus according to Claim 6 or one of the
further claims, 
characterized in that
 the glue assembly
(36) is adjoined in the conveying direction of the

hinge-lid boxes (10) by a testing unit (59) for
checking the applications of glue, in particular having

U-shaped testing elements (60, 61), between the legs
(62, 63) of which the packaging material runs through,

a for example inductive field which can be influenced
by the applications of glue being formed between the

legs (62, 63).
