<ABSTRACT>
The invention proposes a method and a circuit arrangement for carrying out the method in order to generate a pseudo random sequence of bit data, using a feedback-type shift register device, at least one switching state of the shift register device determining whether the bit data are output. Such a method and a circuit arrangement for carrying out the method are preferably used for encrypting data, particularly for detecting the authenticity of a data carrying arrangement, for example a chip card.

<CLAIMS>
Method for generating a pseudo-random sequence of 
bit data (A) from the output data (P) of a feedback 

shift register device (R, S) by controlled masking out 
of bits of the output data (P), the control of the 

masking out being influenced exclusively by the 
switching state of predetermined shift register cells 

(b, c, d, e) of the shift register device (R, S) by 
means of a non-linear logical function. 
Circuit arrangement for carrying out the method 
according to Claim 1, in which a feedback shift 

register device (S, R) having a switching device (T) on 
the output side contains a multiplicity of cascaded 

shift register cells (a...z), and in which predetermined 
shift register cells (b, c, d, e) are connected, on the 

output side, to a circuit (F) which realizes a 
non-linear logical function (h) and which, on the 

output side, is connected to the switching device (T) 
for the control thereof,
characterized
 

in that
 exclusively the predetermined shift register 
cells (b, c, d, e) of the shift register device are 

connected to the input of the non-linear function (h). 
Circuit arrangement according to Claim 2,
characterized in that
 the circuit which realizes a 
non-linear logical function (h) has logic AND and OR 

gates. 
Circuit arrangement according to Claim 2 or 3,
characterized in that
 the switching device (T) is a 
logic gate. 
Circuit arrangement according to one of Claims 2 
to 4,
characterized in that
 a buffer device for continuously  
 

outputting the pseudo-random sequence with data is 
provided at the switching device (T) on the output 

side. 
Use of the method according to Claim 1 or of the 
circuit arrangement according to one of Claims 2 to 5 

in a data carrier arrangement, in particular a smart 
card with an integrated circuit arrangement, for 

identifying authenticity. 
Use of the method according to Claim 1 or of the 
circuit arrangement according to one of Claims 2 to 5 

for the encryption of data.
