<ABSTRACT>
An electrical connector is equipped with a device for 
detecting the mating and unmating of the male (1) and 

female (2) parts of the connector. The male part (1) has 
an integral latchpiece (11) and a pair of terminal pins 

(14, 15) connected to an associated detector circuit (50) 
for detecting the mating of the male and female parts of 

the electric connector. The female part (2) has an 
integral counter latching projection (33) and an electrical 

conductor (34) mounted on the counter latching projection 
for electrically connecting the pair of pins (14, 15) upon 

the mating-and-locking of the male and female parts. 
The counter latching projection (33) functions as 
switching means responsive to the mating and unmating of 

the male and female parts of the electrical connector 
permitting the detector to detect the mating and unmating 

of the male and female parts.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrical
connector assembly equipped with means for detecting the
mating of its male and female housings.Japanese Utility Model Application, Public Disclosure
No. 5-8882 discloses an electrical connector assembly
capable of detecting the mating of its male and female
housings. The male housing includes a plurality of pin
terminals and the female housing includes a plurality of
receptacle terminals.In this prior art connector the male and female
housings are molded of a synthetic resin material, and each
housing is composed of a main body and an associated
separate cover. The main body of one of these housings has
an integrally molded lever. The lever has contacts on its
opposite arms, and when the male and female housings are
mated, the contacts of the lever of the male (or female)
housing engage the contacts provided on the surface of the
female (or male) housing facing the male (or female)
housing, thereby permitting an associated detector circuit
to detect the mating of the male and female parts.This type of detecting arrangement is useful in
detecting the mating of the male and female housings. It,
however, requires the lever on the male (or female) housing
and the associated contacts on the female (or male) housing
for cooperating with lever's contacts to close an
associated detector circuit, thereby detecting the mating 
of the male and female housings. A problem with such an
arrangement is that the mechanical male-and-female mating
action is effected separately from the electrical detection
and an indication of the completed connection of the male
and female housing is possible in spite of incomplete
mating of the connector housings.Furthermore, such a connector requires extra number of
parts such as a lever and associated elements, thereby
increasing the manufacturing cost.From US-A-5,131,865 there is prior known a connector
having a coupling detecting function. The connector includes
a resilient locking arm and a cooperable engaging element
provided on first and second housings, respectively. A pair
of coupling detecting contacts are disposed on the first
housing for the locking arm and each has a contact portion
which is displaced in response to displacement of the
locking arm. A short-circuit contact is secured to the
engaging element. When two housings are coupled completely,
the coupling detecting contacts contact with the short-circuit
contact to establish an electrical connection. When
the two housings are not coupled completely, the engaging
element
