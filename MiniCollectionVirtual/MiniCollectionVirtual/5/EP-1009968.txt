<DESCRIPTION>
Computerized automotive service and diagnostic equipment systems for measuring or testing various parameters and for providing maintenance or repair procedure instructions to an operator are generally known. Such systems utilize a central control processor and various data input and storage means including, for example, vehicle-mounted instrument sensors, manual data input consoles, and electronically-stored databases.Systems that utilize vehicle-mounted instruments enable sensors or measuring devices in the instruments to provide measurement signals to a central processor for comparison with data or computation of vehicle conditions. In addition to providing input or measured data, vehicle-mounted sensors enable live or real-time monitoring of various conditions.Measured data and operator-input data provided through, for example, a keyboard or similar means, can be compared to pre-stored data or parameters calculated from one or more of pre-stored data, measured data, or user-input data. Data and computed or measured results can be compared to known, pre-stored data for specific makes and models of vehicles or parts to identify conditions or to diagnose problems. Possible problems and conditions are pre-stored in the memory of the computer and are displayed or presented to the operator via a display screen or printer.In addition, such systems can include step-by-step adjustment or repair procedure instructions displayed in response to measured or input data in order to guide an operator or technician through an adjustment or repair procedure.
The presentation "Das Bosch-Werkstatt Netz" (presentation, January 1997) discloses a network manager, connected to test devices, reference data, buisiness software and the like, which are all linked together by the same interfaces.The present invention relates to a vehicle service system given with single independent claim 1. Such systems that communicate with or access remotely located computers via the Internet have pre-stored data or utilize prestored data and parameters. The same are utilized to access remotely located computers that are interfaced with other equipment or human operators for real-time or frequently updated information.The popularity of the Internet has promoted development of improved standards in communication technology. One such standard is "HTTP" or Hypertext Transmission Protocol. HTTP is the underlying protocol that allows information to flow through the World Wide Web of the Internet. Specifically, http allows the transfer of
