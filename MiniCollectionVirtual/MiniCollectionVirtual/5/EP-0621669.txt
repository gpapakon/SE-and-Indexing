<ABSTRACT>
A housing having an inserted front panel (5; 6) over which a front frame (2) engages and which is fixed between bearing regions and the front frame (2) has different bearing regions (3a; 3b; 3c; 3d; 3e), which are arranged in a stepped manner, at a differing distance from the front. In this case, the distances between mutually opposite ends, which belong to the same bearing region, reduce from the outside to the inside. This is done in such a manner that the front panel (6) having the greatest thickness in each case has the smallest base area, and the front panel having the smallest thickness has the largest base area in each case. At the same time, the front frame (2) in each case rests on the outer surface of in each case one front panel (5; 6).

<CLAIMS>
Housing with inserted front plate (5;6) which is 
engaged by a front frame (2) and is fixed between the 

contact bearing areas and front frame (2) wherein the 
front frame (2) rests on the outer face of each front 

plate (5;6),
 
characterised in that different contact bearing areas 

(3a;3b; 3c;3d; 3e) arranged in steps are provided at 
different distances from the front side wherein the 

distances between opposing end sides defining the contact 
areas and belonging to each same contact area decrease 

from outside towards the inside so that the front plate 
(6) with the greatest thickness has the smallest base face 

and the front plate with the smallest thickness has the 
relevant largest base face. 
Housing according to claim 1 characterised in that the 
stepped contact bearing areas (3a;3b;3c;3d;3e) are 

provided on a circumferential frame. 
Housing according to claims 1 and 2 characterised in 
that the frame is connected in keyed engagement with the 

lower part (1) of the housing.
