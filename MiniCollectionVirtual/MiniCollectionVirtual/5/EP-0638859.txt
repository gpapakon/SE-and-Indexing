<ABSTRACT>
Digital signal processing device having at least three data registers and a flag register, which exchange binary coded data with at least one peripheral unit via a data bus, having two shift registers, which are respectively loaded with the contents of one of the data registers, having two modification units, which are respectively connected downstream of the shift registers and, with corresponding control, invert an operand formed by the contents of the respectively associated shift register, or replace it by its absolute value, or replace it by zero, or retain it unchanged, having an arithmetic unit, which, with corresponding control, either adds together the two operands, provided by the modification units, and an overflow bit, stored in the flag register, stores the addition result in one of the data registers and sets the overflow bit in the flag register as a function of the presence of an overflow, or compares the operands with one another and stores the comparison result in the flag register, having a multiplication register, which [lacuna]
 by the arithmetic unit and, via the data bus, by at least one peripheral unit, having a logic block, which controls the shift operation of at least one of the two shift registers as a function of the contents of the multiplication register, and having a programmable sequence controller, for the program-dependent control of the data exchange between the data registers and at least one peripheral unit as well as between the flag register and at least one peripheral unit and for the program-dependent control of the operations of the shift registers, the modification unit and the arithmetic unit.

<CLAIMS>
Digital signal processing device having at
least three data registers (RA, RB, RC, RD) and one

flag register (FR) which interchange binary-coded data
with at least one peripheral unit (RAM, ROM, NORM,

MULT, EA) via a data bus (DB), having two shift
registers (SR1, SR2) which are each loaded with the

content of one of the data registers (RA, RB, RC, RD),
having two modification units (MOD1, MOD2) which are

each connected downstream of the shift registers (SR1,
SR2) and which, under appropriate control, invert an

operand formed by the content of the respectively
associated shift register (SR1, SR2) or replace it with

its absolute value or replace it with zero or keep it
unchanged, having an arithmetic logic unit (ALU) which,

under appropriate control, either adds together the two
operands provided by the modification units (MOD1,

MOD2) and an overflow bit (C) stored in the flag
register (FR), stores the result of the addition in one

of the data registers (RA, RB, RC, RD) and, depending
on the presence of an overflow, sets the overflow bit

in the flag register, or compares the operands with one
another and stores the result of the comparison (Q) in

the flag register (FR), having a multiplication
register (MR) to which the arithmetic logic unit (ALU)

and, via the data bus (DB), at least one peripheral
unit (RAM, ROM, NORM, MULT, EA) can write information,

having a logic unit (SL) which controls the shift
operation of at least one of the two shift registers 

(SR1, SR2), depending on the content of the
multiplication register (MR), and having a programmable

sequence controller (CU) for program-dependent control
of the data interchange between the data registers (RA,

RB, RC, RD) and at least one peripheral unit (RAM, ROM,
NORM, MULT, EA) or the arithmetic logic unit (ALU) and

between the flag register (FR) and at least one
peripheral unit (RAM, ROM, NORM, MULT, EA) or the

arithmetic logic unit (ALU) and for program-dependent
control of the operations of the shift registers (SR1,

SR2), the modification unit (MOD1, MOD2) and the
arithmetic logic unit (ALU).
Signal processing device according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the arithmetic logic unit (ALU)

has a saturation unit (SAT) connected downstream which,
under the appropriate control of the sequence

controller (CU), sets the data word at the output of
the arithmetic logic unit (ALU) to a specific value.
Signal processing device according to Claim 1
or 2, characterized in that one peripheral unit is a

normalization unit (NORM) which converts data
represented in fixed-point form into data represented

in floating-point form, and vice versa.
Signal processing device according to one of
Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that one peripheral

unit is a multiplication unit (MULT) which multiplies
two data words together.
Signal processing device according to one of
Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the peripheral

units provided are volatile and/or non-volatile storage
units (RAM, ROM).
