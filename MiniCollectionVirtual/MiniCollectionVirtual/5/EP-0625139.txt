<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel herbicidally active substituted benzyl carbamates, to 
their preparation, to compositions containing said benzyl carbamates as active ingredient, 
and to the use thereof for controlling weeds, especially in crops of useful plants such as 
cereals, rice, maize, soybeans and cotton. Substituted alkyl and phenyl carbamates with herbicidal properties are already known and 
disclosed, inter alia, in US-A-5 078 783 and US-A-5 099 059. There have now been found novel substituted benzyl carbamates with herbicidal 
properties and having good activity. The novel benzyl carbamates have the formula I 
 
wherein 
R is halogen, trifluoromethyl, cyano, nitro or C1-C3haloalkoxy; Z is hydrogen or halogen; or Z and R together in 2- and 3-position of the phenyl ring form the group -OCF2O-; R1 is C1-C5alkyl; R2 and R3 are each independently of the other hydrogen, methyl or ethyl; X is oxygen, sulfur, -SO- or -SO2-; Y is hydrogen, halogen, C1-C3alkyl, C1-C3haloalkyl, C1-C3alkoxy or cyano; and n is 0, 1 or 2;  
and the diastereoisomers thereof.  
 Halogen in the above definitions will be taken to mean iodo and, preferably, fluoro, chloro 
and bromo. Alkyl groups may suitably be straight-chain or branched alkyl groups, typically methyl, 
ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl, isobutyl, tert-butyl, n-pentyl and the isomers 
thereof. Methyl and ethyl are preferred. Haloalkyl may suitably be alkyl substituted by one or more than one halogen atom, 
preferably by one to three halogen atoms, the halogen being bromo or iodo and, 
preferably, fluoro or chloro. Illustrative examples are fluoromethyl, difluoromethyl, 
chloromethyl, dichloromethyl, trichloromethyl and, preferably, trifluoromethyl. Alkoxy may suitably be methoxy, ethoxy, n-propoxy and isopropoxy. Haloalkoxy may suitably be difluoromethoxy, trifluoromethoxy, 2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy and 
1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethoxy. Difluoromethoxy and trifluoromethoxy are preferred. When applied postemergence, but especially preemergence, the novel benzyl carbamates 
of formula I have good selectivity in crops of useful plants such as cereals, rice, maize, 
soybeans and cotton. Compounds of formula I, wherein R is chloro, bromo, trifluoromethyl or trifluoromethoxy, 
are preferred. Those compounds of formula I are also preferred wherein Z is hydrogen or fluoro. Preferred compounds of formula I also include those wherein R1 is methyl or ethyl. Compounds of formula I, wherein R2 and R3 are each independently of the other hydrogen 
or methyl, are
