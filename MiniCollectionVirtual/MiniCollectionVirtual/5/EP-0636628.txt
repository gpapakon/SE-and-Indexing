<ABSTRACT>
Transition metal complexes of Gable porphyrins having 
two porphyrin rings connected through a linking group, and 

having on the porphyrin rings electron-withdrawing groups, 
such as halogen, nitro or cyano. These complexes are useful 

as catalysts for the oxidation of organic compounds, e. g. 
alkanes.

<DESCRIPTION>
Prior work by the present inventors has established 
that highly halogenated metalloporphyrins are superior 
catalysts for the rapid and selective oxidation of 
hydrocarbons; (U. S. Patents 4,970,348; 4,900,871; 
4,895,682; and 4,895,680). The presence of fluoro, chloro 
and bromo substituents on the porphyrin ring is believed to 
cause enhancement of oxidative stability and increased 
catalytic activity. The mechanism of oxidation of 
hydrocarbon substrate, S, is believed to occur as follows, 
but the invention is not restricted to this mechanism: 
Since it is necessary for two metalloporphyrin 
molecules to reductively bind the dioxygen molecule, the 
placement of both metal centers in the same molecule, as in 
a Gable porphyrin, would permit dioxygen binding between the 
metals, thereby enhancing the oxidation rate. The present 
invention concerns such a porphyrin and a process for using 
it to oxidize alkanes.  An ortho-Gable-porphyrin has been synthesized, see 
Meier, Kobuke and Kugimiya, J. Chem. Soc., Chem. Commun., 
1989, 923, wherein the biszinc complex, with two 
mesotriphenylporphins joined at the fourth meso position of 
each ring to ortho positions of a phenylene radical, is 
prepared in 70% yield after chromatographic separation. According to the present invention, metal complexes of 
Gable porphyrins are prepared containing one or more 
electron-withdrawing substituents in the ligand portion of 
the molecule. A general formula for such compounds is: 
where M is a transition metal from Groups I, VI, VII or VIII 
of the Periodic Table, Y is hydrogen or alkyl, such as 
methyl, ethyl or homologs, or an electron-withdrawing 
substituent for hydrogen, Z is hydrocarbyl, halohydrocarbyl 
or halocarbyl, R is an aromatic group, and A is an anion or 
is absent. Preferred electron-withdrawing substituents are 
substituents such as chlorine, bromine, fluorine, nitro  
 
groups and cyano groups. Halogenation procedures such as 
those disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,900,871 issued February 
13, 1990, in application U.S. Serial No. 07/568,116 (EP-A-0471561) on 
halogenated metal porphyrins and metal phthalocyanines 
useful as oxidation catalysts and in application U.S. Serial 
No. 07/634,261 (EP-A-0494508) on improved process for preparing 
perhaloporphyrin complexes, nitration procedures such as 
disclosed in U.S. Patent 5,120,882 issued June 9, 1992 and 
in application U.S. Serial No. 07/892,106 (US-A-5 280 115) filed June 2, 
1992, and cyanation procedures such as those disclosed in 
U.S. Patent No.
