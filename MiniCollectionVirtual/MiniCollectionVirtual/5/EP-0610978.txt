<ABSTRACT>
Milling cutters are of the type formed by a plurality 
of modules or discs supporting the respective cutting 

elements (5) located in the ends of the radial arms (3) 
defined between the cuts (4) of the periphery. 
The different modules are juxtaposed upon having 
cotter ways (6) that are displaced anglewise, in a α 

angle whose value is defined by the ratio:

   α= ± 180/Z (1+2n) 
 
, wherein

 
   Z = number of cuts or arms of the module

 
   n = any whole number

 
being displaced in order to progressively cut the corresponding 

area of the section to be milled. This section 
may be straight, curvilinear or combined, indistinctly.

<DESCRIPTION>
As is expressed in the title of this specification, 
the present invention refers to some improvements introduced 
in the manufacture of milling cutters, therefore 
providing a series of relevant and advantageous features 
over milling cutters presently used to mechanize pieces. In accordance with the invention, the following advantages 
are achieved: 
It is possible to manufacture in series milling 
cutters with which a complex section in the mechanized 
piece is to be achieved, given that the section is obtained 
by means of juxtaposed modules and by profiling 
the blades according to the section to be milled, whatever 
its geometric shape is. Important reduction of manufacturing time and 
labor, which determines that the delivery time is considerably 
improved. The modules are manufactured from standardized 
metal sheets and therefore the present special thicknesses 
that are required as raw material disappear. The section of the milling cutter can be modified 
at any time, by varying the modules thereof. If a module is dented one need only replace it by 
another one. This system for forming the milling cutter 
to obtain a specific section can be applied both to 
milling cutters that are mounted on a shaft or core with 
a hole or on shafts with a handle. As the cutting is progressive or fractioned, the 
power needed to move the tool is less, thus the energy 
consumption drops. The cutting elements are very small and upon being 
easy to handle, the total cost thereof is low and better  
 
materials can be used. Presently milling cutters are normally built in a 
single piece therefore the same would become unusable 
if it is dented and it cannot be sharpened. This causes such tools to be so expensive. As to the form of the tools it depends on whether 
they are used for cutting wood, metal, as well as whether 
they are fed manually, semi-automatically or automatically. Helical cutters used to mechanize metals are also 
known. Such materials require progressive cutting that 
is not as direct as with wood. Such cutters are comprised 
of a plurality of discs that are placed in an adjustable 
arrangement with nonrotating coupling upon a core of a 
milling cutter support , the teeth remaining helically 
staggered. In broad outline, the improvements introduced in the 
manufacture of milling cutters, that the invention proposes, 
even being of the type of milling cutters that is constituted 
from tje juxtaposition of different discs or modules fastened 
by means of a cotter way to the center core, has enormous

<CLAIMS>
Improvements introduced in the manufacture of 
milling cutters, which are of the type that are formed 

by the juxtaposition of different discs or modules, 
fastened by means of a cotter way to a center core, 

characterized in that irrespective of whether the cut 
is straight or it determines the formation of a characteristic 

curvilinear or combined section, the α fastening 
angle between the different elements is defined by 

the ratio   α = ± 180/Z (1+2n)  
, wherein 

   α = displacement angle of the cotter ways 
   Z = number of cuts or arms of the module 

   n = any whole number 
   the modules being able to have different diameters 

depending on the needs of the section to be milled, descending 
even mill
imeter by millimeter in the outer diameter 
thereof, but maintaining the number of arms as 

well as the inside dimension thereof and each one of 
the discs carrying out the corresponding part of the 

section to be milled, whereby modules of a specific 
diameter can be mounted and blades can be profiled 

according to the desired section.
