<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus are disclosed for treating an organic waste containing hydrogen and carbon in molten metal to form enriched hydrogen and carbon oxide gas streams. In one embodiment, the organic waste is introduced into a molten metal contained in a carbonization reactor without the addition of a separate oxidizing agent and under conditions sufficient to decompose the organic waste to generate hydrogen gas and carbonize the molten metal. Carbonized molten metal is directed from the carbonization reactor to a decarbonization reactor and an oxidizing agent is introduced into the carbonized molten metal in the decarbonization reactor to oxidize carbon contained therein thereby decarbonizing said molten metal and generating an enriched stream of carbon oxide gas.

<DESCRIPTION>
Disposal of organic wastes in landfills and by 
incineration has become an increasingly difficult 
problem because of diminishing availability of disposal 
space, strengthened governmental regulations, and the 
growing public awareness of the impact of hazardous 
substance contamination upon the environment. Release 
of hazardous organic wastes to the environment can 
contaminate air and water supplies thereby diminishing 
the quality of life in the affected populations. To minimize the environmental effects of the 
disposal of organic wastes, methods must be developed 
to convert these wastes into benign, and preferably, 
useful substances. In response to this need, there has 
been a substantial investment in the development of 
alternate methods for suitably treating hazardous 
organic wastes. One of the most promising new methods 
is described in U.S. Patents 4,574,714 and 4,602,574, 
issued to Bach and Nagel. The Bach/Nagel method for 
destroying organic material, including toxic wastes, 
involves decomposition of the organic material to its 
atomic constituents in a molten metal and reformation 
of these atomic constituents into environmentally 
acceptable products, including hydrogen, carbon 
monoxide and/or carbon dioxide gases. The present invention is as claimed in the claims. The present invention relates to a method 
for treating an organic waste containing  
 
hydrogen and carbon in molten metal to form enriched 
hydrogen and carbon oxide gas streams. In one embodiment, organic waste containing 
hydrogen and carbon is introduced into molten metal 
contained in a carbonization reactor without the 
addition of a separate oxidizing agent and under 
conditions sufficient to decompose the organic waste 
and to generate hydrogen gas and carbonize the molten 
metal. Carbonized molten metal is transferred from the 
carbonization reactor to a decarbonization reactor. An 
oxidizing agent is introduced into the carbonized 
molten metal in the decarbonization reactor to oxidize 
carbon contained therein thereby decarbonizing the 
molten metal and generating an enriched stream of 
carbon oxide gas. The decarbonized molten metal is 
then directed from the decarbonization reactor to the 
carbonization reactor. In another embodiment of the invention employed to 
increase significantly the amount of carbon dioxide to 
carbon monoxide in the enriched carbon oxide gas 
stream, the organic waste is introduced into molten 
metal contained in a carbonization reactor without the 
addition of a separate oxidizing

<CLAIMS>
A method for treating an organic waste containing 
hydrogen and carbon in a molten metal to form a hydrogen-rich 

gas stream and a carbon oxide-rich gas stream, 
comprising the steps of: 


a) introducing the organic waste containing hydrogen 
and carbon into the molten metal contained in a 

carbonization reactor without the addition of a separate 
oxidizing agent and under conditions sufficient to 

decompose the organic waste and to generate a hydrogen-rich 
gas stream in a first gas zone and carbonize the molten 

metal and wherein the molten metal is selected to provide 
a significantly increased molar ratio of carbon dioxide to 

carbon monoxide compared to that produced in a molten bath 
consisting essentially of molten iron under the same 

conditions; 
b) directing the carbonized molten metal from the 
carbonization reactor to a decarbonization reactor; 
c) introducing an oxidizing agent containing oxygen 
in an amount into the carbonized molten metal in the 

decarbonization reactor to oxidize the carbon contained 
therein, thereby decarbonizing said molten metal and 

generating a carbon oxide-rich gas stream in a second gas 
zone having a significantly increased molar ratio of carbon  

 
dioxide to carbon monoxide compared to that produced in a 

molten bath consisting essentially of molten iron under the 
same conditions, said second gas zone being separate from 

the first gas zone; and 
d) directing the decarbonized molten metal from the 
decarbonization reactor to the carbonization reactor. 
The method of claim 1 wherein the molten metal 
consists essentially of manganese or molten iron and copper. 
A method for treating an organic waste as claimed 
in any preceding claim in which the hydrogen-rich gas 

stream and the carbon oxide-rich gas stream are formed 
simultaneously, the molten metal comprises a first molten 

metal and a second molten metal, and in which step c) is 
carried out while continuing step a). 
The method of claim 3 wherein the first molten 
metal comprises iron and the second molten metal 

comprises copper. 
A method for treating an organic waste as claimed 
in any preceding claim in which said molten metal having a

A method for treating an organic waste as claimed 
in any preceding claim wherein the molten metal is selected 

to provide a significantly increased molar ratio of carbon 
dioxide to carbon monoxide compared to that produced in a 

molten bath consisting essentially of molten iron under the 
same operating conditions, to simultaneously form a 

hydrogen-rich gas stream and carbon oxide-rich gas stream, 
the organic waste containing hydrogen and carbon is 

introduced in a substantially vertical direction into the 
molten metal, and wherein said vessel has a baffle disposed 

within said reactor which extends sufficiently into the 
molten metal to separate the internal space within said 

reactor into a carbonization zone and a decarbonization 
zone, said baffle allowing essentially all of the hydrogen 

gas to form in the carbonization zone while not allowing a 
substantial loss of hydrogen into the decarbonization zone, 

and allowing essentially all of the carbon oxide gas to

substantial loss of carbon oxide gas to the carbonization 
zone.

molten metal comprises two immiscible metals wherein, at 

the operating conditions, the first immiscible metal has a

than that for oxidation of carbon monoxide to form carbon 
dioxide.
