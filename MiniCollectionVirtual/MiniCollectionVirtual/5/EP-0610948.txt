<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for mechanically opening and closing windows with hidden fitting, which can also be used, in a simple manner, in the case of hidden fittings which have been conventionally used up until now, if said fittings are intended to be actuated manually or in a mechanised manner by means of a motor drive. With the connection of a displaceable intermediate piece and the connecting rod, which has been used anyway up until now, for releasing or locking the resting elements, it is possible in an extremely simple manner to trigger, and at the same time to release, the motor-operated window-actuating mechanism. In this arrangement, a very high degree of functional reliability of the device can be achieved by using simple securing elements in conjunction with overload-proof motors. Furthermore, an automatically operating device, of which further permits manual window actuation can be provided by virtue of the separate drive of the intermediate piece.
