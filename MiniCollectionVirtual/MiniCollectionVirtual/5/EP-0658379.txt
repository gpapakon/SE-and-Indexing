<ABSTRACT>
The roller mill has a grinding roller (1, 2) which revolves in a grinding ring (3, 4), the diameter of the grinding roller corresponding to at the least the inside radius of the grinding ring. The grinding roller (1, 2) is kept in motion by a tangential force from a drive (7). To this end, the drive (7) drives a drive table (20) to which two parallel stop beams (21) are fastened. Projecting between these beams is a stop body (23) which transmits the force to the grinding roller. The grinding roller (1, 2) and the grinding ring (3, 4) are each suspended on three universal shafts (6 and 5 resp.) and can be deflected laterally. This arrangement ensures that the centre of gravity of the grinding roller always revolves in the grinding ring at a constant revolving frequency. In addition, the suspension of the grinding roller by universal joints guarantees that its rotary impulse does not change during the revolving so that the torques acting on the mill housing remain small.

Roller mill with a milling roller (1, 2),
a substantially cylindrical milling ring surface (16) and

a drive (7, 8), wherein the milling roller (1, 2) has a
diameter, which is approximately as large as or lager

than the radius of the milling ring surface (16), and
wherein for milling the milling roller (1, 2) is rotating

about a milling roller axis and is rolling on the milling
ring surface (16), wherein the milling roller (1, 2) can

be freely rotated about the milling roller axis and a
force component tangential the milling ring surface (16)

can be exerted onto the milling roller (1, 2) by means of
the drive (7, 8), characterised in that the milling

roller (1, 2) and a milling ring (3, 4) forming the cylindrical
milling ring surface (16) are mounted in laterally

displaceable manner and that a distributing table
(62) for material to be milled is arranged on the milling

ring (3, 4) above the milling roller (1, 2).
Roller mill of claim 1, characterised in
that the milling roller is mounted in such a way that the

direction of the milling roller axis always remains the
same during milling.
Roller mill of one of the preceding claims
characterised in that the milling roller (1, 2) is held

by a milling roller table (52, 52'), wherein the milling
roller table (52) is rotatably arranged on a milling

roller table holder (58; 75, 76) and wherein the milling
roller table holder (58) is fixed in position in respect

to the milling ring surface (16).
Roller mill of claim 3, characterised in
that the milling roller table (52') can be driven to a

circular motion about the central axis of the milling
ring (3, 4).
Roller mill of one of the claims 3 or 4,
characterised in that the milling roller table (52) is 

connected to a drive (7, 19) by means of a cardan shaft
(70).
Roller mill of one of the preceding claims
characterised in that it comprises a resting frame (11)

and that the milling ring (3, 4) cannot be rotated in respect
to the frame (11).
Roller mill of one of the preceding claims
characterised in that the milling roller (1, 2) is connected

to a rotating drive shaft (19, 20) by means of a
coupling means (8), wherein the milling roller (1, 2) can

be rotated in respect to the coupling means (8).
Roller mill of claim 7, characterised in
that the coupling means (8) comprises at least two stopping

elements (21, 23), a first (21) of which is connected
to the driving shaft (19, 20) and a second of

which is connected to the milling roller (1, 2), wherein
the tangential force component can by transmitted by

means of the stopping elements (21, 23).
Roller mill of claim 7, characterised in
that the coupling means comprises a coupling member (40),

which is connected by a first joint assembly (24', 41)
with the milling roller (1, 2) and by a second joint assembly

(42, 43) with the driving shaft (19, 20).
Roller mill of claim 7, characterised in
that the coupling means (8) comprises a roller table

(52'), which is connected to the milling ring in non-rotational
but laterally displaceable manner and which

can be driven in a circular motion about the central axis
of the milling ring (3, 4).
Roller mill of one of the preceding
claims characterised in that in a resting position of the

roller mill the milling roller (1, 2) is moved out of the
centre of the milling ring surface.
Roller mill of one of the preceding
claims characterised in that a wall (46, 64) is arranged

on the milling ring (3, 4) in order to prevent that material 
to be milled falls over the outside of the milling

ring.
Roller mill of one of the preceding
claims characterised in that a damping element (17) for

damping of strong movements of the milling ring (3, 4) is
arranged outside the milling ring (3, 4).
