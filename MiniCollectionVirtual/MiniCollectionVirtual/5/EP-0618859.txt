<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a plastic blow
molding machine of the wheel type including a frame
rotatable about a horizontal rotational axis with a
plurality of mold stations mounted on the wheel frame
about the rotational axis and each mold station having
a pair of mold supports for mounting a pair of mold
portions of a mold for movement parallel to the
rotational axis between a mold open position where the
mold portions are spiced from each other and a mold
closed position where the mold portions define an
enclosed cavity in which blow molding is performed.Plastic blow molding machines of the wheel
type, such as disclosed by United States Patents
3,310,834 Simpson et al, 3,764,250 Waterloo, which represent
constructions in accordance with the preamble of claim 1, and
3,986,807 Takegami et al, have previously included a
wheel having a frame supported on a base for rotation
about a horizontal axis with a plurality of mold
stations mounted on the wheel frame about the rotational
axis such that a pair of mold supports for respectively
mounting a pair of mold portions move parallel to the
rotational axis between open and closed positions of the
mold. Such blow molding machines conventionally include
a closing station where the mold supports move the mold
portions to a closed position to enclose an extruded hot
plastic parison within a mold cavity for blowing to the
shape of the mold and for subsequent cooling prior to
opening at in opening station after approximately 3/4 of
a revolution of the wheel. Toggle and lock mechanisms
which are normally spring biased have previously been
cam operated to move the mold supports between the open 
and closed position in a manner that asymmetrically
loads the wheel frame and eventually results in wear
that requires maintenance.Plastic blow molding machines of the wheel
type wherein the mold supports move horizontally toward
and away from each other between the open and closed
positions are preferable in comparison to book-type
molds that pivot between open and closed positions on a
mold wheel such as disclosed by United States Patent
3,608,015 Martelli. Such book-type molds on a wheel
have more limited room in the open position to permit
positioning of the parison between the open mold
portions which can result in manufacturing problems.An object of the present invention is to
provide an improved plastic blow molding machine of the
wheel type.The invention provides a plastic blow molding machine
constructed in accordance with claim 1. The manner in which the mold supports
