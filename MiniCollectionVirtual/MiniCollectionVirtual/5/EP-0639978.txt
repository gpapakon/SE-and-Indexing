<ABSTRACT>
A pharmaceutical combination having antineoplastic activity based on platinum complexes and procainamide is described. Said combination shows a prolonged and remarkable activity, also in terms of survival and allows to obtain a remarkable protection against the typical platinum complex toxicity. Said combination can be both in the form suitable for the contemporaneous administration of the two components through parenteral or intracavitary route, and in the form of a kit containing two distinct pharmaceutical compositions, to be separately administered optionally through two different administration routes.

<DESCRIPTION>
PHARMACEUTICAL COMBINATION HAVING ANTINEOPLASTIC ACTIVITYThe present invention relates to a pharmaceutical combination having antineoplastic activity based on platinum complexes and procainamide.Cisplatin (DDP) is one of the most effective and most used drugs in the antineoplastic therapy, and is the precursor of a new class of drugs having a potent antitumor activity, such as carboplatin, tetraplatin, liproplatin, TNO-6-, DACH and the like (Chemistry in Britain, Nov. 86, pp 1001-1004). The use of such drugs is however limited by the severe toxic and side effects (nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, nausea, emesis and hemopoietic toxicity) . The therapeutic strategies adopted to limit DDP and other platinum complex toxicity to date brought no real therapeutic advantages. It has been evidenced how the protection from toxic effects is often associated to a reduction of oncolytic activity, which is not balanced by the possibility to administer higher doses of the drug.In the attempt to limit DDP toxicity, without however limiting antitumor efficacy, the combination between DDP and procaine (P.HC1), a well-known local anesthetic, was proposed; nevertheless, the obtained results were not particularly encouraging, since the therapeutic index of said combination showed an insufficient improvement (Esposito M. et al., J Natl Cancer Inst 8 : 677, 1990).It has now surprisingly been found that the combination between DDP or other antitumor platinum 

 complexes and procainamide hydrochloride (Pd.HCl), a well-known antiarithmic agent, not only shows a longer and significantly higher activity in comparison with the procaine combination, even in terms of survival, but also allows to obtain a remarkable protection from the typical toxicity of platinum complexes.By itself, procainamide has no antitumor activity, but, when combined with DDP, it protects particularly from acute nephrotoxicity, hemopoietic toxicity, mitocondral damage, oxidative phosphorylation and other unwanted metabolic effects, which are induced by the antiblastic agent, further improving the therapeutic activity thereof.According to the invention, the combination exerts its effects both by simultaneous use of the two components, and by separate use of the same.Therefore, the present invention relates both to a combination of DDP or other platinum complexes with Pd.HCl, the two components to be contemporaneously administered by parenteral or intracavitary administration, and to a kit containing the two drugs, in the form of two distinct pharmaceutical
