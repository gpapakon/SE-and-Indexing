<DESCRIPTION>
 Homo- or copolymers of vinylchloride containing α - olefins.The intenvion relates to a homo- or copolymer of vinyl chloride containing α- olefins.Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is pricewise an economical thermoplastic suitable for a large number of applications. In order to make PVC suitable for processing, various additives, such as stabilizers, lubricants, pigments and/or modifiers, are added to the resin obtained in the polymerization. The additives are generally admixed into the PVC polymer afterwards before use.Methods are also known, wherein, in connection with the PVC polymerization, monomers or polymers improving the properties of the end product or adjusting the polymerization of vinyl chloride are added to the polymerization reactor. Thus, according e.g. to the US patent 3560462, to the vinyl chloride polymerization reactor is added, for preventing the self-acceleration of the polymerization reaction, at least one C10-C22 α-olefin, which is preferably hexadecene or octadecene. The amount of α-olefin is 0.1-5 weight-%.In the patent application JP 61155401 is described a suspension polymerization method, wherein 0.1-5 weight-% of C6-C20 --olefin is copolymerized with vinyl chloride. The polymer has a residual monomer content, which is lower than the usual content, and which polymer contains less fish eyes.In the patent publication US 4031299 is described a vinyl chloride suspension polymerization method, wherein a prehomogenized polyallyl compound and an oligomer of propane, preferably a tetramer, are added to the polymerization reactor. The Theological properties can be improved by means of the propylene oligomer. 

 In the patent application JP 51059987, the vinyl chloride has been polymerized for reducing the amount of fish eyes occurring in the polymer in the presense of a low-molecular-weight polyethylene and an alkane and/or a fatty-acid ester.It has been observed according to the invention that improved homo- or copolymers of vinyl chloride are obtained, if the polymer contains α -olefins with a longer carbon chain as oligomers. Thus, the homo- or copolymer of vinyl chloride according to the invention is characterized in that it contains 0.01-50% by weight of an oligomer of a C4-C20 α-olefin or of an internal olefin or of their mixtures.In the inventive vinyl-chloride polymer, the ohgomer of the α-olefin apparently acts as an internal lubricant, which decreases or removes the need for using other lubricants or lubricating aids usually applied.The oligomer may be added into the polymerization
