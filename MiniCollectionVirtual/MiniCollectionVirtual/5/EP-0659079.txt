Pharmaceutic product comprising portions of pentetrazol 
(6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-5H-tetrazol(1,5a)azepine) as active 

substance, characterized in that said pharmaceutic product 
is present in a form suitable for transdermal application, 

i.e. as a plaster comprising an impermeable backing layer, 
an active-substance reservoir of a polymer matrix connected 

thereto, and, where no other control mechanisms are 
present, a membrane controlling the release of active substance, 

a pressure-sensitive adhesive device for securing 
the plaster to the skin and, if required, a protective 

layer which is removable prior to application of the 
plaster. 
The pharmaceutic product according to claim 1, characterized 
in that it contains at least one skin-compatible 

auxiliary agent. 
The pharmaceutic product according to claim 1 or 2 for 
use in the prophylaxis of pathologic vasodilations. 
The pharmaceutic product according to claim 1 or 2 for 
use in the treatment of pathologic vasodilations. 
Pharmaceutic product according to one or more of claims 
1 to 4, characterized in that it contains 0.1 to 50%-wt., 

preferably 3 to 25%-wt. and particularly preferred 5 to 
15%-wt. of active substance. 
Process for the production of the pharmaceutic product 
for a transdermal application for the prophylaxis and 

treatment of vasodilations according to claims 1 to 5, 
characterized by the following steps:  

 

a) active substance, plasticizer(s) or softener(s), and, 
optionally, auxiliary agents are homogeneously mixed, 

in solution, with the components of a solution of pressure-sensitive 
adhesive, 
b) the solution is applied to an active substance-insoluble 
backing layer to form an evenly thin layer, 
c) then the solvent is driven off by application of heat, 
d) the resultant pressure-sensitive adhesive layer is 
covered with a protective layer which has been rendered 

dehesive, whereupon 
e) individual plasters are manufactured by punching said 
plasters out of the laminte. 
The process according to claim 6, characterized in that 
the concentration of the active substance pentetrazole is 

between 0.1 and 50%-wt of the polymer matrix. 
The process according to claims 6 and 7, characterized 
in that as base polymer of the matrix the following substances 

are used: rubber; rubber-similar synthetic homopolymers, 
copolymers or blockpolymers; poly(meth)acrylic 

acids and poly(meth)acrylic acid esters and the copolymers 
thereof; polyurethanes and silicones. 
The process according to claim 7, characterized in that 
as base polymer the following substances are preferably 

used: blockcopolymers based on styrene and 1,3-dienes; 
polyisobutylenes; polymers based on acrylate and/or methacrylate.  

 
The process according to any one of claims 6 to 9, 
characterized in that as polymers which are added to the 

base polymer polymethacrylates, esters of hydrogenated 
colophony and polyvinyls are used. 
The process according to one or more of claims 6 to 10, 
characterized in that as plasticizers or softeners higher 

alcohols such as dodecanol, 2-octyldodecanol, undecanol, 
octanol; esters of carboxylic acid - the alcohol component 

thereof may also be a polyethoxylated alcohol; diesters of 
dicarboxylic acid, e.g. di-n-butyl-adipate; as well as triglycerides, 

in particular medium-chain triglycerides of 
caprylic/capric acids of coconut oil. 
The process according to claim 11, characterized in 
that as plasticizers or softeners the following substances 

are preferably used: polyvalent alcohols such as glycerin 
and propanediol-(1,2) etc., which may also be esterified by 

polyethylene glycols; as well as saturated or unsaturated, 
cyclic or linear hydrocarbons such as dioctylcyclohexane. 
The process according to one or more of claims 6 to 12, 
characterized in that the active substance reservoir is 

formed by spreading the solution such that a weight per 
unit area of 125 g/m
2
 is obtained.
