<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a technique for a color imaging system having a luminance component and two color difference (chrominance) components (10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 24), which allots more space in the compressed data stream to the signal component of greater information content or complexity; that is, which combines the encoding of the components of the data representing a common portion of an image in response to the actual needs of the component, prior to encoding the combined data. To this end, the calculation of the quantizing factors (32, 34) considers the combined information content of both the luminance and chrominance components for the same image location. Thus, low chrominance complexity allows the transmission (42, 44) of more of the luminance information, and vice versa. The system also provides for predetermining the relative complexity of the signal components to thus pre-allot the amount of space for each signal component in the compressed data stream in proportion to its measured complexity.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to real-time compression and
encoding of digital video signals to provide for the transmission of
compressed digital data through a communications channel, or for
recording and playback of compressed data on a magnetic tape recorder or
other recording medium. More particularly, the present invention relates
to a technique for combining the encoding of, for example, the luminance
and chrominance components of a common portion of an image, such
that in a portion with less chrominance information content more
luminance information is conveyed, and vice versa.In general, the goal of data compression is to send digital
information from one point to another through a transmission channel
using the least amount of information transfer as is possible. In other
words, the object is to eliminate the transmission of unnecessary
information. Video images, by their very nature, contain a great deal of
redundancy and thus are good candidates for data compression. A
straight-forward digital representation of an image necessarily contains
much of the same redundancy both in a spatial sense and a temporal
sense. By removing a portion of the redundancy from the image data at
the transmitter, the amount of data transmitted over a communications
channel or recorded on a storage medium may be substantially reduced.
The image then may be reconstructed by reintroducing the redundancy at
the receiver or, if recorded, in the recorder playback electronics. It is to be
understood that the expression "image data" as used herein refers to data
defining an image to be displayed in two dimensions, which further may
take the form of a time varying image composed of multiple video frames
which are equally spaced in time. Such a signal might be a moving scene
derived from a video camera. Image compression for use in conjunction with digital video
tape recorders has several unique requirements which impose additional
constraints on any compression method used. The additional constraints
arise from the typical modes of use of a video tape recorder, and from the
fact that the data must be stored for later use rather than immediately
transmitted. For example, a tape recorder must allow editing of the
recorded information. In a recording system where data is formatted in
fixed length sync blocks, this means that the stored data for one field
should occupy an integer number of tracks on the tape or occupy defined
blocks of video data, such as a television field, at predictable locations or
tracks on the tape. In a
