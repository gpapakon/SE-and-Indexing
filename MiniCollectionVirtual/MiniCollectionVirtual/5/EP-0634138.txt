<ABSTRACT>
An ultrasonic diagnosing method and 
an apparatus therefor, wherein improvements 

in real time properties, expansion of a visual 
field region and improvements in S/N ratio 

can be achieved without sacrificing any one of 
the real time properties, the visual field region 

and the S/N ratio. In a first aspect, according 
to the present invention, an ultrasonic diagnosing 

method is provided, which is characterized 
in that a visual field region is divided into 

two or more, a transmitting wave has a main 
lobe and a grating lobe generated to take 

charge of the above-described divided regions, 
respectively, for scanning, a receiving wave separately 

processes a direction of the main lobe 
and a direction of the grating lobe to generate 

images of the above-described divided regions 
separately from each other, and the images of the above-described divided regions are synthesized to be displayed as an image of 

the whole visual field region. In a second aspect, according to the present invention, an ultrasonic diagnosing apparatus is provided, 
comprising: an ultrasonic wave probe; a transmitting wave control means for having the probe generate a transmitting 

wave having main lobe and a grating lobe and causing the main lobe and the grating lobe to take charge of the above-described 
two or more divided regions, respectively, for scanning; a main lobe reception processing means having a directivity only in the 

direction of the main lobe, for generating an image of the region taken charge of by the main lobe; a grating lobe reception processing 
means having a directivity only in the direction of the grating lobe, for generating an image of the region taken charge of 

by the grating lobe; and an image display means for synthesizing the image of the region taken charge of by the main lobe and 
the image of the region taken charge of by the grating lobe to thereby display an image of the whole visual field region.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ultrasonic 
diagnostic method and an ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus 
and, more specifically, to an ultrasonic diagnostic 
method that employs grating lobes to enhance real-time 
performance, to enlarge visual field and to improve S/N 
ratio, and an ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus for 
carrying out the ultrasonic diagnostic method. In carrying out Doppler color flow mapping (CFM) by 
the conventional ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus, the 
pitch p of oscillatory elements and the wavelength λ of 
an ultrasonic sounding wave are determined so as to meet 
an inequality, p < λ/2 so that only a main lobe exists 
in the visual field, i.e., so that no grating lobe 
exists in the visual field, and the visual field is 
scanned by the main lobe. The grating lobe is prevented from existence in the 
visual field to prevent formation of a virtual image by 
the grating lobe.  Although not directly relating with the present 
invention, because the grating lobe is different from 
the side lobe, a technique of preventing a virtual image 
attributable to the side lobe is disclosed in Japanese 
Patent Laid-open (Kokai) No. 61-11030. In the Doppler CFM by the ultrasonic diagnostic 
apparatus, the real-time performance can be enhanced by 
increasing the frame rate F, the visual field can be 
enlarged by increasing the number N of sound rays, and 
the S/N ratio can be improved by increasing the pulse 
repetition frequency P. However, since the relation between the frame rate 
F, the number N of sound rays, the pulse repetition 
frequency (the number of successive pulses to cause the 
phase variation of one sound ray) P, the maximum 
detection depth Dmax and the sound velocity c is 
expressed by: 
F × N × P × 2Dmax / c < 1  
, the increase of 
the frame rate F, the increase of the number N of sound 
rays, and the increase of the pulse repetition frequency 
P contradict each other. Accordingly, the enhancement of the real-time 
performance, the expansion of the visual field or the 
improvement of the S/N ratio, entails inevitably the 
sacrifice of the visual field or the S/N ratio, the  
 
real-time performance or the S/N ratio, or the real time 
performance or the visual field. Accordingly, it is an object of the present 
invention to provide an ultrasonic diagnostic method 
capable enhancing real-time performance, enlarging 
visual field and improving S/N ratio without sacrificing 
any of real-time performance, visual field and S/N 
ratio, and to provide an ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus
