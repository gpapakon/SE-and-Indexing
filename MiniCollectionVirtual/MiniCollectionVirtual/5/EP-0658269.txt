<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a solid polymer
electrolyte having high ionic conductivity using a polymer
having an oxyalkyl side chain that contains urethane bonding;
an electrode comprising such a polymer and a process for
manufacturing the same; a battery comprising such a solid
polymer electrolyte or such an electrode and a process for
manufacturing the same; and an electric double layer
capacitor using such a solid polymer electrolyte and a
process for manufacturing the same.In the field of ionics, there is a trend of down-sizing
as well as making it to be of the solid-state type, and
efforts are being made extensively with view to application,
to solid-state primary or secondary batteries and electric
double layer capacitors, of solid electrolytes as a new ionic
conductor which replaces conventional electrolyte solutions.
Conventional batteries with electrolyte solutions have
problems in long-term reliability since there tends to occur
leakage of the electrolyte solution out of the parts or
elution of the electrode substance. On the contrary, 
products with solid electrolytes do not cause such problems
and it is easy to make their thickness smaller. Furthermore,
solid electrolytes are excellent in thermal resistance and
advantageous in the manufacturing process of products such as
battery.Among batteries using a solid electrolyte, those using
a polymer as a main component of the electrolyte have a merit
of increased flexibility as compared with those using an
inorganic substance, which endows the former with
processability into various forms. However, such products as
hitherto studied still suffer from the problem that only a
small amount of current can be taken out since the solid
polymer electrolyte has a low ionic conductivity.As an example of such a solid polymer electrolyte, it is
described in British Polymer Journal (Br. Polym. J.), vol.
319, page 137, 1975 that a compounded material consisting of
a polyethylene oxide and an inorganic alkali metal salt
exhibits ionic conductivity, which is, however, as low as
10-7 S/cm at room temperature.Recently, there have been many reports that a comb-shaped
polymer having an oligooxyethylene in its side
chains has an improved ionic conductivity due to increased
thermal motion of the oxyethylene chain which contributes to
ionic conductivity. An example in which polymethacrylic acid
with oligooxyethylene being added to its side chain is
compounded with an alkali metal salt is described in Journal
of Physical Chemistry (J. Phys. Chem.), vol. 89, page
