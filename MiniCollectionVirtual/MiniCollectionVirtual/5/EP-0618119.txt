<ABSTRACT>
So that a device for adjusting the braking force on rail vehicles which is in fact provided for rail vehicles with a vehicle bus can also be used for trains which are composed of rail vehicles of relatively new and relatively old designs, it is proposed according to the invention that instead of the brake signal transmission via the vehicle bus (15) the brake signal which can be switched pneumatically via a main air line (71) can be transmitted to the brake control (13) by means of a PU transducer (72) connected to the main air line (71).

A device for setting the braking force in rail vehicles, in which a main 
container air line (29), associated with each rail vehicle, is guided via a 

controlled or regulated valve system to a brake cylinder (10), which is provided 
with a linkage regulating unit (9) and the brake-rod linkage (5) of which, which 

is connected to a piston rod (8), cooperates by means of two oppositely directed 
brake shoes (4a, 4b) with a brake disc (3) which is secured on the axis (2) of the 

pair of wheels (1a, 1b), in which nominal value sigals are directed via a 
vehicle-BUS (15) and/or a pulse width control (22) to a brake control (13) for 

processing and the brake control signals are connected by means of lines (35, 36, 
37) to the valve system, in which a braking moment receiver (11) is arranged in 

the brake-rod linkage (5) for the measurement of expansion, traction or bending 
forces and for conversion into an electrical measurement signal, the 

measurement signals are passed on to the brake control (13) and are compared 
with nominal value signals of a nominal value potentiometer (18) which are 

obtained via the vehicle-BUS (15) and/or the pulse width control (22), and the 
differential value nominal signal is passed on via the valve system to the brake 

cylinder (10) to alter the braking moment on the pair of brake shoes (4a, 4b), in 
which instead of the brake signal transmission via the vehicle-BUS (15) and/or 

the pulse width control (22) the brake signal, which is able to be switched 

pneumatically via a main air line (71) is able to be transferred to the brake 
control (13) by means of a PU converter (72) connected to the main air line 

(71). 
A device according to Claim 1,
 
characterised in that in each individual rail vehicle a PU converter (72), 

connected by means of a pressed air line (73) or by means of electrical lines 
(74) is connected to the brake control (13).
