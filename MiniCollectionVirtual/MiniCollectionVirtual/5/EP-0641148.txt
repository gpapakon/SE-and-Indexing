<ABSTRACT>
In an electronic ballast (2) which contains an electronic harmonic filter (7), the brightness of a lamp (3) can be ensured (maintained) by using a dimmer (1) provided in the mains feed line by feeding the controller (8) with a desired-value signal (UM) for setting the frequency (f) of the switch (S), which signal is a function of the input or output voltage of a rectifier (4) connected downstream of the dimmer (1), in particular a function of the curve of these voltages.

Electronic ballast for supplying a load (3), for
example a lamp, in particular a gas-discharge lamp (3),

with an alternating voltage whose frequency is higher than
the mains frequency, comprising


a first rectifier (12) to be connected to the
alternating-current mains,
an inverter (6) which is connected downstream of the
latter and which generates the higher-frequency

alternating voltage for the load (3), and
an electronic harmonic filter (5) which is disposed
between the first rectifier (12) and the inverter (6)

and whose output voltage is controlled,

characterized in that the control point for controlling the
output voltage of the harmonic filter (5) is dependent on

the voltage variations of the input voltage or output
voltage (UD or UG, or alternatively UK) of a second

rectifier (4) likewise to be connected to the alternating-current
mains.
Electronic ballast according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the electronic harmonic filter (5) contains a

clocked switching controller (7).
Electronic ballast according to Claim 2, characterized
in that there are fed to the clocked switching controller

(7) a first control-point signal, which is dependent on the
rectified mains voltage, and a first measured-value signal,

which is dependent on its output shape, and in that the
amplitudes of the output-current pulses are controlled by

comparing these two signals in such a way that they form an
envelope curve matched to the sinusoidal half-waves of the

rectified mains voltage.
Electronic ballast according to Claim 2 or 3,
characterized in that there are fed to the clocked

switching controller (7) a second control-point signal
(UM), which is dependent on the input voltage or output 

voltage (UD, UG, UK) of the second rectifier (4) and also a
second measured-value signal, which is dependent on its

output voltage (UA), and in that the clock frequency (f)
for the switch (S) of the switching controller is varied as

a function of the error signal of these two signals.
Electronic ballast according to Claim 4, characterized
in that, to generate the control-point signal (UM), the

output voltage of the second rectifier (4) for a voltage
divider (R1, R2), if necessary, is fed to the one input of

a comparator (9), that a threshold-value voltage (US) is
fed to the other input of the comparator (3), in that the

output voltage (UK) of the comparator is fed to an averager
(11), and in that the output voltage (UM) of the averager

(11) is used as a second control-point signal.
Electronic ballast according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that, if a lamp (3) is used as

load, there is connected upstream of the second rectifier
(4) a dimmer (1) which varies the curve shape of the mains

voltage.
Electronic ballast according to Claim 6, characterized
in that the dimmer (1) contains an on-gating phase-control

circuit or an off-gating phase-control circuit.
