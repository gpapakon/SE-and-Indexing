<ABSTRACT>
Elements of the compressed video signal which are of 
greatest importance to signal decompression are set (12) a 

plurality of times in redundant transport cells. Media error codes 
are concatenated to the redundant data such that when and if 

such redundant data is applied (20,21) to the corresponding 
decompressor (22), the media error code will automatically force 

the decompressor to resynchronize.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to video signal compression apparatus and more
particularly to apparatus for generating and utilizing media error codesSiracusa et al. in US Patent 5,289,276 describe a video signal compression
system which includes circuitry for compressing video data to generate a
hierarchically layered encoded compressed signal, such as MPEG. MPEG is a
coding standard developed by Moving Picture Experts Group of the
International Standardization Organization. To insure high quality signal
recovery, for signals broadcast in a terrestrial medium, such as according to the
NTSC broadcast standard, the MPEG compressed signal is packetized in
transports cells, each of which includes signal identifiers and error detection
codes. Portions of the MPEG data which are particularly important to signal
reconstruction, at a corresponding receiver, are formed in redundant cells and
interleaved at predetermined locations in the cell sequence. The predetermined
locations are arranged such that if the original particularly important data is lost,
the probability of the redundant cell being concurrently lost is extremely small.
Thus, a receiver for reproducing the compressed data, will have the requisite
information available.The receiver in the Siracusa et al. system includes an inverse packet or cell
processor which performs a plurality of functions including reconstructing the
MPEG data stream from the cell payloads, storing the data in redundant cells
for use in case of lost data, recognizing loss of data, and generating media
error codes. The signal provided by the inverse cell processor is applied to an
MPEG decompression apparatus. The decompression apparatus expects data
to occur in a specific sequence defined by the MPEG protocol. If data is lost,
the data sequence is corrupted. If the decompressor is not alerted to the
corruption of the compressed data sequence it will incorrectly process
subsequent data. In view of these possibilities the decompressor is arranged to
recognize a particular codeword (designated herein as a media error code), in
the compressed data stream. Responsive to the media error code, the 
decompressor is conditioned to ignore data until the next occurrence of a start
code. On reception of the next start code the decompressor resynchronizes to
the current data.
Document EP-A-0 422 575 discloses a system in which a receiver is provided
by a transmitter with the type of loss compensation method to be utilized in
case data blocks are lost.Depending on when and what data is lost,
