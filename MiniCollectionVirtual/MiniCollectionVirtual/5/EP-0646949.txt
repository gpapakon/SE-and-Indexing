<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a method of forming a 
semiconductor device (10). A layer of photoresist (21) is 

applied to a semiconductor wafer (11). A first mask (30) is 
used to protect a first portion of the photoresist (21) while a 

second portion of the photoresist (21) is exposed. A second 
mask (31) is used to expose a third portion of the photoresist 

(21) wherein the third portion of the photoresist (21) includes 
part of the first portion of the photoresist (21). The 

photoresist (21) is developed to form a photoresist mask 
(22,23,24,26).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates, in general, to 
semiconductor devices, and more particularly, to a novel 
method of forming electrical connections between elements of 
a semiconductor device. In the past, the semiconductor industry has utilized a 
variety of methods to interconnect the various elements used 
in forming a semiconductor device. Radio frequency (R.F.) 
power devices is one family of semiconductor devices that 
generally are formed by such methods. Typically, R.F. power 
devices are formed by connecting a large number of small 
individual transistors together in parallel. The amount of 
current to be carried by the R. F. power device determines the 
number of small transistors that are used. One problem with large R. F. power devices is the area 
required to form the conductor or interconnect pattern. 
Generally, the reticle of a wafer stepping exposure system is 
used as a mask to expose photoresist on a semiconductor 
wafer. Often the pattern to be exposed is too large to fit onto 
one reticle of a wafer stepping exposure system. Consequently, 
the interconnect pattern is split into two overlapping sections 
that fit onto two separate stepper reticles. Using two reticles 
to form a conductor interconnect mask typically requires 
several critical alignments to ensure registration of the two 
images resulting from the two reticles. Such multiple 
exposures require precise alignment between the two images 
formed by the two stepper reticles. Also, the multiple 
exposures require twice as much time to expose the entire 
interconnect pattern thereby increasing manufacturing costs.  
 
Additionally, two sets of stepper reticles must be maintained 
thereby further increasing manufacturing costs. Accordingly, it is desirable to have a method of forming 
large semiconductor devices that does not require more than 
one stepper reticle, that does not require precise alignment, 
and that reduces manufacturing costs. Briefly stated, the present invention includes forming a 
semiconductor device by applying a layer of photoresist to a 
semiconductor wafer. A first mask is used to protect a first 
portion of the photoresist while a second portion of the 
photoresist is exposed. A second mask is used to expose a 
third portion of the photoresist wherein the third portion of 
the photoresist includes part of the first portion of the 
photoresist. The photoresist is developed to form a 
photoresist mask. FIG. 1 is an enlarged perspective cut-away view 
illustrating a stage in forming a semiconductor device
