adjusting means (1) for adjusting a paste-in position in 

pasting a secondary image in a primary image, an image data 
editing means (3) for editing the image of a third image 

resulted by the pasting of the secondary image in the primary 
image, an image data compressing means (5) for compressing 

the image data through a block encoding, an optimal value

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to an image data 
processing apparatus, and more particularly, to an image data 
processing apparatus for editing images on personal computers 
and the like. Recently image data processing apparatus has been 
developed to edit by correcting or modifying images of 
photographs or pictorial arts by inputting them into personal 
computers as image data by using an image scanner. Hovewer, it becomes necessary to compress the image data 
because of the increased capacity of a memory device 
which is needed for storing the image data and also in 
order to implement data communication or a data 
exchange to other apparatus , together with the increase 
of image data to be edited. Now, as a high efficiency compression system of a still 
picture a block encoding system such as the JPEG (Joint 
photographic Expert Group) system is commonly used. If these image data compressing systems are supported 
in hardware or software of the image data editing 
apparatus, the compression of image data for storing may be 
carried out after the image editing. While if these image 
data compressing systems are not supported in such hardware 
or software, the compression of the image data may be 
carried out after storing them with an appropriate image  
 
format. FIGURE 1 is a block diagram showing one embodiment of the 
conventional image data compressing apparatus. A user performs 
an editing operation on an image data by using a user 
interface 11. The image data is processed by a data 
processing means 12 in response to the input operation of the 
user. The processed image data is displayed on a monitor of 
an image display means 13. When storing the processed image 
data it is stored in a data storing means 15 such as a 
magnetic disc after compression by a data compressing means 
14. In the image editing operation a pasting operation for pasting 
different small images on a base image is frequently carried 
out. For example it is frequently derived to paste on 
image,which had been cut out from a secondary image 
and stored in a memory, on a primary image to be used as a 
base image. Here when storing the edited image data by compression 
based on the JPEG system, a compression rate or a picture 
quality varies considerably when the image paste-in 
position has been slightly shifted. This is because a result 
of a quantization or an adaptive DCT processing varies in 
accordance with where a contour of the image is located 
within a 8x8 pixel block associated with a DCT (an 
abbreviat
