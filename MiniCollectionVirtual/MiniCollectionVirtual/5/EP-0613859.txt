<ABSTRACT>
A novel aluminosilicate zeolite, denominated LZ-277 
is synthesized hydrothermally from aqueous gels in the 

Na₂O - Al₂O₃ - SiO₂ system and in the absence of an organic 
templating agent. The as-synthesized LZ-277 has a 

chemical composition on an anhydrous basis expressed in 
terms of molar oxide ratios of:



1.0 ± 0.1 Na₂O : Al₂O₃ : 3-15 SiO₂



 
and has a low adsorptive capacity for SF₆ compared with 

the prior known, and possibly topologically related, 
zeolite Phi.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to 
crystalline microporous zeolitic aluminosilicates and 
more particularly to a novel crystalline zeolite which 
possibly is topologically related to zeolite Phi. The 
zeolite is denominated LZ-277 and is prepared by 
hydrothermal crystallization from an aqueous gel in the 
Na₂O - Al₂O₃ - SiO₂ system without the presence of an 
organic templating agent. Zeolite Phi is defined and the method for its 
synthesis described in detail in US-A-4,124,686. As disclosed 
therein, zeolite Phi is prepared hydrothermally from 
aqueous gels in the [N(CH₃)₄]₂O - Na₂O - Al₂O₃ - 
SiO₂ system. As synthesized, the zeolite exhibits large 
pore adsorption characteristics, has a composition 
expressed in terms of molar oxide ratios as

1.0 ± 0.05 Na₂O : 0.02-0.05 R₂O : Al₂O₃ : 4-7 SiO₂ : 0-6 H₂O


 
wherein "R" represents the tetramethylammonium ion, and 
has a characteristic x-ray powder diffraction pattern 
containing at least the d-spacings shown in Table A 
below.  Interplanar Spacing d,A Relative Intensity 11.6 ± 0.2M 9.5 ± 0.2S 7.00 ± 0.15S 5.61 ± 0.10S 5.04 ± 0.08S 4.31 ± 0.08S 3.43 ± 0.06VS 2.92 ± 0.05VS 2.61 ± 0.05W 2.09 ± 0.05W In the expression of the relative intensity values, VS = 
very strong, S = strong, M = medium and W = weak. 
Evidence supporting the large-pore status of zeolite Phi 
includes adsorption data for (C₄F₉)₃N and neopentane, the 
latter being adsorbed on a calcined template-free form of 
zeolite Phi in an amount of 3.5 weight percent at a 
temperature of 25°C and a neopentane pressure of 750 torr. (100 kPa) 
These data can be interpreted to mean that zeolite Phi 
contains 12-membered oxygen rings, a proposition further 
supported by data reported by Martens and Jacobs 
(ZEOLITES, 1986, vol. 6, September) derived from the 
bifunctional conversion of n-decane using Pt-loaded 
hydrogen forms of zeolite Phi. It is observed that in 
the x-ray diffraction pattern of the zeolite a number of 
the diffraction lines are broadened, suggesting a high 
degree of disorder in certain crystallographic directions 
and making a detailed elucidation of the crystal 
structure impossible.  In addition to the original synthesis of zeolite Phi 
using tetramethylammonium ions as the structure-directing 
agent, another synthesis using tetraethylammonium 
hydroxide (TEAOH) as the organic base and tetraethylorthosilicate 
as the silica source has been reported. In 
this regard see M. J. Franco et al, ZEOLITES, 1991, Vol. 
11 April/May. In this synthesis the presence of 
potassium
