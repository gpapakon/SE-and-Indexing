<ABSTRACT>
A positioning table device is disclosed, 
which includes a position detecting system for 

detecting the position of a table, a multiphase motor 
having a plurality of coils, for moving the table, a 

designating system for designating magnitude of an 
energizing electric current for each coil, a selecting 

system for selecting one or more of the coils to be 
energized, in accordance with the position of the 

table, a servo circuit for controlling an electric 
current energizing the selected coil or coils so that 

it becomes equal to the level of the designated 
magnitude, and a controller for slowing a change in an 

energizing electric current magnitude signal to be 
applied to the servo circuit upon coil selection and 

change so as to substantially avoid a change in 
magnitude of combined electric current to each coil.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a multiphase motor arrangement
usable in a precise machining instrument or a
semiconductor device manufacturing exposure apparatus,
for example. More particularly, the invention is
concerned with a multiphase motor arrangement having a
position detector for detecting the position of a
table and a multiphase type motor for selectively
changing coils to be energized, in accordance with the
position of the table.Figure 6 is a schematic view of a
positioning table device. As illustrated, the device
comprises linear motor coil means 104 having four
coils (four phases) arrayed along a straight line.
The linear motor coil means 104 is supported by a coil
supporting member 103, and a pair of guides 102
extends in parallel to the array of the coils
constituting the linear motor coil means 104. Mounted
on the guides 102 are a pair of upper and lower table
top plates 101 which are disposed to sandwich the
linear motor coil means 104 therebetween, with the
intervention of guide means 112. These top plates 101
can be slidably moved in the direction of the coil
array while being guided by the guides 102. The guide
means 112 comprises any one of rolling, sliding and 
static pressure guiding means, for example, which can
be selected suitably in consideration of the
positioning precision or easiness of maintenance, for
example. Each of the upper and lower top plates 101
is provided with movable magnet means 105 which
comprises four permanent magnets disposed along the
coil array with their magnetic poles disposed
alternately. These movable magnets 105 are mounted to
the table top plate 101 through the linear motor coil
means 104 so that different magnetic poles are opposed
to each other.Provided at the side of the guide 102 is a
position detector 106 such as a linear scale, for
example, for detecting the position of the table top
plate 101. Connected to this position detector 106 is
a counter unit 107 for detecting a position signal of
the table. Connected to this counter unit 107 is a
phase changing controller 109 for changing the coil
phase. The controller 109 serves to actuate switches
110 in accordance with the table position signal from
the counter unit 107. The coil phase is connected to
corresponding switch 110 through a corresponding
current amplifier 111, such that in response to coil
selection signals outputted from the controller 109
the switches 110 are actuated to change the voltage
application to the coils. Connected to the counter
unit 107 is a servo controller 108 which serves
