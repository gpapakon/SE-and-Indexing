<ABSTRACT>
An ultrasonic handpiece wherein the entire assembled 
handpiece may be sterilized with an ingress of the sterilizing 

fluid into the interior of the handpiece. The handpiece 
is formed with an elongated housing sleeve and a 

coil unit for establishing an alternating magnetic field 
located therein. The housing sleeve and coil unit is 

assembled such that crevices are formed between the ends 
of the housing sleeve and coil unit, thus allowing steam, 

chemicals and heat to pass in and out of the interior of 
the handpiece for more rapid and thorough sterilizing of 

the handpiece. Further, the coil unit is not potted to 
the housing sleeve in order to allow for different thermal 

coefficients of expansion between materials without the 
buildup of undue stress.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to handpieces containing
an interior electrical winding, which handpieces are
for use in treating mammals. More particularly the
present invention relates in a preferred embodiment to
ultrasonic dental/medical hand tools and more especially
to an ultrasonic dental handpiece which can withstand the
rigors of hundreds of cycles of sterilization using anyone
of a number of currently widely used sterilization methods
and equipment including autoclaving, dry heat at 190°C and
Chemical, while fully assembled without unacceptable
detrimental effects to the handpiece. Specifically, the
electrical components of the handpiece can be subjected to
any of these sterilization techniques without material
damage with fluid and heat entering the interior of the
handpiece.Ultrasonic dental handpieces employed during dental
procedures for cutting or cleaning are well known. One such example is U.S. patent No. 4,492,574 to
Warrin et al., which
discloses the features of the preamble of claim 1 and
teaches an ultrasonic endodontic
dental handpiece having a coil for establishing an
alternating magnetic field, the housing having a cooling
fluid inlet at one end and being open at the other end for
receiving and supporting a removable insert.Today, cross contamination has become a major concern
in the medical and dental fields. Bacteria and viruses
from one patient's mouth can be transferred to another
patient if the handpiece is not adequately sterilized.
Therefore, sterilization of dental instruments has become
almost mandatory. However, due to the sensitive nature of
the electrical and mechanical components involved with
ultrasonic handpieces, sterilization of the entire handpiece
was previously limited.Prior to this invention the more usual method used to
cleanse and disinfect ultrasonic handpieces was to wipe
the exterior of the handpiece using a disinfecting
solution. Where autoclaving was alleged to be acceptable,
its use was limited to handpieces of simpler design having
only heavy gauge wire windings.In many prior art handpieces a coil of conductive
wire within the handpiece was connected permanently by a
cable to a power source. An oscillating current within
the coil in the handpiece produced a magnetic field to
induce motion within a magnetostrictive element separable 
and removably inserted within the magnetic field within
the handpiece. The magnetostrictive element was connected
by a metal body to a dental tool which was caused to
vibrate at ultrasonic speeds to clean and reduce teeth,

An ultrasonic handpiece (10) comprising:

an elongated housing sleeve (12) made from universal-sterilizable material and
comprising an inner wall (11);
a coil unit (22) made from universal-sterilizable material and comprising at least
one coil (72, 74, 76) and having an outer dimension proximate one end which is

configured to abut said inner wall (11) of said housing sleeve (12) when assembled
within said housing sleeve (12) such that at least one crevice (62, 64) exists

therebetween and opening to said coil;
an external cable assembly (90) for providing power and fluid inlet being
detachably connected to the housing sleeve (12),

characterised in that the external cable assembly (90) provides a fluid outlet
and is detachable from said coil

unit (22),
wherein the coil unit (22) is assembled within the housing sleeve (12) such that
the entire assembly can be repetitiously universally-sterilized with the passage of

universal-sterilizing fluids through said crevice (62, 64) into said elongated housing
sleeve (12) and to said coil (72, 74, 76) with the cable assembly (90) being

detached from the housing sleeve (12) and the coil unit (22).
The handpiece of claim 1 wherein the outer dimension of said coil unit (22)
proximate either said one end or said opposite end includes ribs (21) which

frictionally lock the coil unit (22) within said housing sleeve (12) while leaving at least two
crevices between said inner wall and said outer dimension.
The handpiece of claim 1 wherein the outer dimension surface of the coil unit (22)
which engages said inner wall (11) of said housing sleeve (12) is made from a material
