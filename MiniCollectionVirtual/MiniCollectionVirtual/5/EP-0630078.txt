<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides a charging apparatus for 
an electric vehicle which prevents a charging coupling 

from becoming overheated and melting upon charging. In 
the charging apparatus, when a lever 33 provided on a 

supply connector 2 is grasped, the supply connector 2 
is completely fitted to a vehicle inlet 1 by a pair of 

stays 36 connected to the lever 33. A slide switch 42, 
which serves to open and close a charging circuit in the 

supply connector 2, is inhibited from being operated by 
a stopper face on the lever 33 under a normal condition 

and allowed to be operated when the supply connector 2 
is completely fitted to the vehicle inlet 1. When a 

microswitch 44 associated with the slide switch 42 is 
turned to ON, a relay 90 in a charger 74 is energized 

to close the charging circuit, thereby enabling conduction 
from a power source to a battery.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a charging apparatus for
an electric vehicle, and more particularly to a charging
apparatus for an electric vehicle which can prevent
terminals in a charging coupling from becoming overheated
and melting.Electric vehicles will find increasing use in the
near future in view of environment and energy. As such,
the problem of battery charging must be overcome. In
particular, a coupling for charging raises an important
problem. A charging coupling includes a vehicle inlet or
a vehicle connector installed in an electric vehicle and
a supply connector or a power source connector connected
to a power source on the ground. The vehicle inlet and
supply connector have supply terminals which conduct a
charging current and signal terminals which control the
charging current. Charging work is carried out under
relatively high voltages of 200 to 500 V and relatively
high currents of 30 to 150 A. Accordingly, an arc is
prevented from occurring between the supply terminals
upon fitting the charging coupling.It is effective in charging coupling to extend the
supply terminals and to shorten the signal terminals so
that the signal terminals are contacted with each other
after the supply terminals have been contacted with each
other and the supply terminals are enabled to conduct a
charging current after contacting of the signal terminals
upon fitting the coupling and so that the supply terminals
are inhibited to conduct the current after separating of
the signal terminals upon detaching the coupling. That
is, a difference between lengths of the supply terminals
and signal terminals causes a difference between mechanical
contact times of respective terminals upon fitting and
detaching in coupling. In actual charging work, an operator holds the supply connector
and pushes it into or pulls it out from the vehicle inlet. In the case of
fitting and detaching the charging coupling there is no problem so long as
the supply connector is driven rapidly and straight during insertion and
extraction.However, if the supply connector is not aligned properly, the signal
terminals chatter, that is, they repeatedly contact with and separate from
each other, at the commencement of contact or when detachment is
terminated. Then, since the supply terminals contact each other under a
state of incomplete fitting, chattering of the signal terminals cause the
charging circuit to open and close so as to conduct and shut off the
charging current, thereby overheating and possibly melting the supply
terminals.In order to
