<ABSTRACT>
Dialkyl carbonates can be prepared by reaction of carbon monoxide with alkyl nitrites in a continuous gas-phase reaction in the presence of a catalyst, a solid bed reactor having a short catalyst bed in the flow direction being employed. In this process, the dialkyl carbonates are formed in nearly quantitative selectivity and thermal decomposition of the alkyl nitrite with formation of decomposition products resulting therefrom is not observed.

Process for the preparation of dialkyl carbonate by 

continuous reaction of carbon monoxide with alkyl 
nitrite in the gas phase on a heterogeneous 

catalyst, preferably on a heterogeneous catalyst 
containing one or more platinum metals and particularly 

preferably on a heterogeneous catalyst containing 
palladium, with continuous temperature 

control using a heat transfer medium, characterized 
in that the catalyst bed takes the form of one or 

more flat layers of regular shape with a thickness 
of 0.01 - 50 cm, the surface of the catalyst layers 

being sealed by a gas-permeable layer, and this 
surface, on the starting-material feed side and/or 

on the product discharge side, facing a wall of 
similar regular shape, at a distance of 0.1 - 10 cm, 

which separates the space for the substances to be 
reacted from the space for the heat transfer medium, 

and the substances to be reacted being introduced in 
such a way as to flow through the catalyst bed perpendicularly 

to the flat catalyst layers. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the catalyst bed has a thickness of 0.02 - 20 cm, 

preferably 0.05 - 10 cm and particularly preferably 
0.2 - 2.0 cm. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that  
 

the distance between the catalyst bed and the wall 
is 0.2 - 8.0 cm, preferably 0.3 - 6.0 cm and particularly 

preferably 0.4 - 4.0 cm. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the gas-permeable layer for sealing the catalyst 

layers takes the form of meshwork, a perforated 
screen or sintered material, preferably sintered 

material and particularly preferably sintered metal. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the flat catalyst bed, including its gas-permeable 

sealing layer, has a minimum flow resistance of 1 
mbar to 10 bar, preferably of 2 mbar to 1 bar and 

particularly preferably of 5 - 500 mbar. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the regularly shaped, flat layers of the catalyst 

bed take the form of hollow cylinders, sealed on one 
side, with diameters of 2 - 200 cm, preferably 7 - 

100 cm and particularly preferably 10 - 50 cm, 
several of them being arranged in the form of relatively 

large aggregates, particularly preferably as 
tube bundles, in a preferred embodiment. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
it is carried out at a pressure of 0.1 - 10 bar. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the catalyst temperature is 50 - 150Â°C. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
it is carried out with an alkyl nitrite:carbon 

monoxide volume ratio of 0.1 to 10:1, preferably 0.2 
to 4:1 and particularly preferably 0.3 to 3:1. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
a palladium salt applied to a support is used as the  

 
catalyst.
