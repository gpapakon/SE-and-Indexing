<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for fabricating 
a coloured construction from sections and accessories 

which, at least over part of their surface, are provided 
with a colourant, said sections and accessories being 

successively cleaned and degreased, and provided with a 
coating which is mainly composed of a liquid paint based 

on thermosetting resin, formed by crosslincking of a 
polymer, in which hydroxyl and/or carboxyl groups are 

present with a hardener, and based on thermoplastic 
resin, which is dispersed in the paint; said coating then 

being aftercured; and the sections and accessories then 
being joined to one another to form the coloured construction. 
The invention also relates to appliances for 
employing this method.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for fabricating
a construction composed of sections, having a colour
different from the colour of the base material. Such
a construction is hereinafter called a coloured construction.The invention more in particular relates to a
method for fabricating such a construction, which comprises
sections and accessories which, at least over
part of their surface, are provided with a colourant, said
sections and accessories according to the method of
the invention being provided with said colourant after
their production and prior to assembly of the construction.The field of application of the invention is more
particularly the fabrication of windows, doors, gates or
other constructional elements which are composed of a
plurality of sections and accessories made of plastic.
The plastic used can be either a thermosetting plastic or
a thermoplastic. The fabrication of constructional elements
in most cases makes use of PVC.Various methods are already known for arriving
at a coloured construction composed of plastic sections.A first known method consists in mass colouration
of the base material for the various sections. The
sections are thus produced directly in the desired colour.
The desired construction is then assembled from
sections which consist of plastic of the desired colour.A drawback of this method is that the colour of
the plastic sections, with the exception of the colour
white, is not very weather-resistant. Constructional elements
are obtainable, however, in various colours such
as: brown, grey, beige, green, ... Owing to their poor
weather resistance, constructional elements in these
colours are of lower quality, however.Another known method makes use of the coextrusion
technique. Together with the plastic section, a
thin layer of plastic - having the desired colour - is
extruded onto one or more surfaces of that section, in
such a way that the section has the desired coloured
surfaces.A drawback of this method is that, every time
one wishes to fabricate a different section, or the same
section in a different colour, the extrusion tools (which
provide the coextrusion) on the extrusion machines
have to be replaced or adjusted. Such assembly and
dismantling is very time-consuming and reduces the
production capacity. In order to reduce this waste of
time as far as possible, a large number of identical coloured
sections will therefore be fabricated successively
in each case. Moreover, the fabrication of a particular
construction simultaneously requires a plurality of

Method for fabricating a coloured construction from
sections and accessories which, at least over part of

their surface, are provided with a colourant after
their production and prior to assembly of the

construction, wherein the sections and accessories are
fabricated from plastic, and are

successively

a) cleaned and degreased,
b) provided with a coating of a liquid paint based on
thermosetting resin,
c) brought to a temperature appropriate for
aftercuring of the coating,
d) joinded to one another to form the coloured
construction,
characterized in that
 a paint comprising

a thermosetting polymer containing hydroxyl
and/or carboxyl groups, a hardener composed of

aromatic, aliphatic or cycloaliphatic
diisocyanate or triisocyanate for

crosslinking the polymer; and
a powder of thermoplastic polyamide dispersed in
said paint

is applied on the sections and accessories before joining
said sections and accessories by welding.
Method for the fabrication of a coloured construction
according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the
constructions are windows, doors or gates. 
Method for the fabrication of a coloured construction
according to any of the preceding claims,


characterized in that
 the sections and accessories are
fabricated from PVC, and are

cleaned and degreased by being

an oxidant or cleaning agent such as a solution of

sodium hypochlorite,
b) warm-rinsed,
c) dried,
d) subjected to UV irradiation,
e) treated with a non-chlorinated solvent which is
suitable for said plastic.
Method for the fabrication of a coloured construction
according to any of the preceding claims,


characterized in that
 the application of the coating
takes place in a plurality of successive steps, a

pigment-containing base layer being applied in the
first steps, followed by subsequent steps in which a

UV-resistant coulourless paint, in which preferably
polyamide particles are dispersed, is applied without

the pigment-containing layer having dried.

characterised
in that
 a web of flexible material is
extended by means of a reeling and unreeling appliance

in the vicinity of a section, so as to shield the
surfaces which are not to be coloured.
