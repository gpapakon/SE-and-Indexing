<ABSTRACT>
A multirow spherical roller bearing incorporates an inner 
race ring (11), an outer race ring (12), two rows of rollers 

(14, 15),a cage (16) for each row of rollers and a guiding 
ring (17) disposed between the rows of rollers. The guiding 

ring (17) is arranged to be guided by the outer race ring 
(12) and the cages (16) are arranged to be guided by the 

guiding ring (17).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a multirow, spherical roller 
bearing incorporating an inner race ring, an outer race ring 
with a substantially spherical race track, at least two rows 
of rollers, a cage for each row of rollers and a guiding 
ring provided between the rows of rollers, whereby each cage 
incorporates a first radially outwardly extending flange, a 
second radially inwardly extending flange and a number of 
webs extending between said flanges, which webs form 
boundaries for roller pockets, whereby said webs have an 
extension which is mainly parallel to the axes of the 
adjacent rollers and are situated between the bearing axis 
and the roller axis. A bearing of this type is shown in EP-B-0 225 975 and DE-A-4 240 770. The cages 
in this bearing are guided by the inner race ring or by the 
rollers and the guiding ring is guided by the cages. When 
compared to a bearing of the type known from DE-K-8 702 071 wherein the cage webs are arranged 
substantially in level with the axes of the rollers, a 
bearing of this type can accomodate a larger number of 
rollers and/or longer rollers with bigger diameter, whereby 
the carrying capacity of the bearing is increased. Such a 
bearing operates extremely well in most assemblies except 
e.g. in shaking sieves and other vibrating assemblies. At 
spherical bearings intended for such applications the 
guiding ring is centered either against the race track of 
the outer race ring or against the inner race ring, 
depending on the size of the bearing. At these known 
embodiments the webs of the cages are arranged substantially 
in level with the axes of the rollers. The present invention intends to provide a spherical roller 
bearing having the same advantages as the bearing shown in 
EP-B-0 225975 and DE-A-4 240 770 but which furthermore is suited for use at  
 
vibrating applications. This has been achieved in that the 
invention has been given the features defined in the 
following claim. Hereinafter the invention is described with reference to the 
accompanying drawings in which an embodiment is shown for 
exemplifying reasons. It is to be understood that embodiments of the 
invention can be modified within the scope of the claims. In the drawings Fig. 1 shows an axial section through a spherical roller 
bearing of known design. Fig. 2 is an axial section through a spherical roller 
bearing of another known design. Figs. 3 and 4 show an axial section through a spherical 
roller bearing according to the invention. Fig. 5 shows a section along line V-V

<CLAIMS>
A multirow spherical roller bearing (10) incorporating an 
inner race ring (11), an outer race ring (12) with a 

substantially spherical race track, at least two rows of 
rollers (14,15), a cage (16) for each row of rollers and a 

guiding ring (17) disposed between the rows of rollers, 
whereby each cage incorporates a first radially outwardly 

extending flange (18), a second radially inwardly extending 
flange (19) and a number of webs (20) extending between said 

flanges, which webs form boundaries for roller pockets, 
whereby said webs extend substantially parallel 

to the axes (22) of adjacent rollers and are situated 
between the bearing axis (21) and the roller axes (22),
characterized therein,
 
that the guiding ring (17) is arranged to be guided by the 

outer race ring (19), that the cages (16) are arranged to be 
guided by the guiding ring (17) via the outer periphery of said first flanges, and 

that a clearance (d) is arranged to be maintained between 
said second flanges (19) and the inner race ring (11), 

whereby said clearance (d) as well as a first distance (a) 
between the web (20) and a roller (15) in a direction 

parallel to a line (23) between the centre (24) of the 
roller and the centre (25) of the bearing is bigger than the 

sum of a second distance (c) between the guiding ring (17) 
and the outer race ring (12) and a third distance (b) 

between the guiding ring (17) and the first flange (18).
