<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a light-receiving
semiconductor device including light responsive elements
such as split photodiodes used in an optical pickup, and
more particularly, to a structure for reducing light
surface reflectance in the proximity of a dividing region.Split photodiodes are used for detecting a light
signal in, for example, an optical pickup.Fig. 9 shows a sectional view of conventional two-split
photodiodes. 4-split photodiodes are obtained by
providing two sets of such 2-split photodiodes in
parallel.According to a method of manufacturing the split
photodiodes shown in Fig. 9, first a silicon substrate
including a plurality of N-type silicon layers 1 and 2 are
provided. In general, an N- type epitaxial layer 2 is
grown on N+ type silicon layer 1. Alternatively, N+
diffusion layer 1 may be formed from the bottom of N- type
silicon layer 2. A pattern of a SiO2 film 7 is formed on
N- type silicon layer 2. Using this pattern of SiO2 film 7
as a mask, a plurality of P+ type anode layers 9 are formed 
at the surface of N- type silicon layer 2. Anode layer 9
is covered by an anti-light-reflecting film of a silicon
nitride film 8.Fig. 10 shows a plan view of 6-split photodiodes used
in a conventional optical pickup. Referring to Fig. 10,
the middle four photodiodes 10a, 10b, 10c and 10d are used
for detecting a focus signal. The two diodes 10e and 10f
at both sides are used for detecting a tracking signal.Fig. 11 shows a plan view of 5-split photodiodes used
in an optical pickup employing hologram. The left middle
two photodiodes 11a and 11b are used for detecting a focus
signal and a reproduced signal. The right middle
photodiode llc is used for detecting a reproduced signal.
The two outside photodiodes 11d and 11e are used for
detecting a tracking signal.Fig. 12 schematically shows the arrangement of the
main components in an optical pickup employing a hologram.
Referring to Fig. 12, light emitted from a laser diode 13
sequentially passes through a hologram 14, a collimator
lens 15, and an objective lens 16 to be focused on a
record surface of an optical disk 17. Light reflected
from optical disk 17 passes through objective lens 16,
collimator lens 15, and hologram 14 to be focused on split
photodiodes 18 such as those shown in Fig. 11.Referring to Figs. 13A, 13B and 13C, astigmatism is 
described as an example of a method of detecting focus
error using 4-split photodiodes. The 4-split photodiodes
include a pair of photodiodes 13a and 13d located adjacent
in one diagonal direction,
