<ABSTRACT>
Ski boot comprising an upper in the form of a collar (2) which is closed around the leg by means of two flaps (2a,2b) which overlap and enclose an inner comfort bootee (3). This collar (2) is closed by means of at least one strap (6), one end of which is permanently linked, directly or indirectly, to the collar (2) on the outside of the boot, for example by means of two rivets (21,22) on the inner face of the collar, this strap traversing the collar (2) via an opening (19) formed on the inside of the boot and returning via the outside of the collar to be attached to a tensioner (8) mounted on the outside of the boot. The absence of an anchoring point on the outer flap (2a) of the collar makes it possible to have a thin, flexible flap properly encasing the leg and thereby ensuring comfort and satisfactory holding.

Ski boot comprising a collar-shaped shaft (2) being 
closed on the leg by two overlapping flaps (2a,2b), an 

inner comfort boot (3) and closing and tightening means 
(6,7,8,9) of the collar comprising at least a strap 

(6,7), an end of which is permanently linked directly 
or indirectly to the collar and the other end is 

linkable to the outer side of the collar by hooking 
means (11,12) and a tension device (8), characterised 

in that the strap (6), from its end which is linkable 
to the outer side of the collar, traverses the collar 

by an opening (19) formed on the inner side of the 
collar and returns, from the inside of the collar, in 

the direction of the outer side of the collar, the 
other end of the strap being fixed on a point located 

in the region of the outer side of the boot. 
Ski boot as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that the strap (6) returns under both flaps (2a,2b) of 

the collar, and in that said other end is fixed on the 
outer side of the collar, inside said collar. 
Ski boot as claimed in claim 2, characterised in 
that the opening (19) through the collar is provided 

with a roller. 
Ski boot as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that the strap (6) returns between the flaps (2a,2b) of 

the collar and in that said other end is fixed to the  
 

tension device or to a part (12) interdependent with 
said tension device. 
Ski boot as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that the first part of the return of the strap (6) in 

direction of the outer side of the boot is situated 
under both flaps (2a,2b) of the collar, and in that the 

strap traverses then the inner flap through an opening 
(25) and in that said other end is fixed to the tension 

device or to a part (12) interdependent with said 
tension device. 
Ski boot as claimed in claim 3 or 5, characterised 
in that the inner side of the inner flap (2b) of the 

collar has a groove in which the tensed strap is 
seated, the depth of the groove being such that the 

strap is not cramped between the inner boot and the 
flap. 
Ski boot as claimed in claim 4, characterised in 
that the outer side of the inner flap (2b) and/or the 

inner side of the outer flap (2a) of the collar has a 
groove in which the tensed strap is seated, the depth 

of the groove being such that the strap is not cramped 
between the two flaps.
