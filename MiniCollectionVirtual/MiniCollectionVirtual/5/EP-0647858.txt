<DESCRIPTION>
The object of the present invention is a method for 
counting the number and measuring the intensity of light 
pulses produced by the chemiluminescence labels or 
radioisotopes used in biochemical applications in a 
scintillator, in plane-like samples. In many biochemical methods of determination and analysis, 
the position and number of various proteins or other 
molecules on a plane-like base is measured. Typical 
examples of such methods are electrophoresis, and thin-plate 
and paper chromatography. More recent methods are, 
for example, hybridisations carried out on nylon films and 
various kinds of cell separation methods carried out on 
filter material. The latter method differs from the former 
in that in this method the positions of the samples on the 
filter film are known in advance, and these positions are 
usually arranged in some kind of regular order. In 
electrophoresis and the chromatographic methods, on the 
other hand, the position of molecules with respect to other 
molecules differing in some respect is significant. As detecting a single molecule, or even a few larger 
molecules, as such on a given surface is difficult, in 
biochemistry the substances examined must be labelled with 
a label or tracer to facilitate identification or 
detection. Until the past decade, various radioactive 
labels have been practically the only label type used, 
particularly in chromatography. This is still the case with 
electrophoresis. Only in recent years have various non-radioactive 
labels such as fluorescence and 
chemiluminescence labels become more widely used. Of 
radioactive tracers, beta emitters such as tritium (H-3), 
radiocarbon (C-14) and phosphorus (P-32) have been most 
used. The increasingly common use of these substances is  
 
partly due to the the fact that for beta emitters there has 
existed a reliable quantitative method of measurement: 
liquid scintillation counting. The distance travelled by low-energy beta particles in the 
sample or scintillation liquid is typically a few dozen 
micrometers. Therefore, the radioactively labelled sample 
to be measured has to be placed in direct contact with the 
scintillator. The scintillator may be a liquid containing 
organic molecules or a solid substance, or even an 
inorganic crystalline substance. In the scintillation 
liquid, the beta particle loses its kinetic energy to the 
molecules of the solvent, from which the energy is 
transferred mechanically to the scintillator molecules, 
which become excited. The excitation of the

A method for counting the number and measuring the

labels or radioisotopes used in biochemical applications in 
a scintillator, in plane-like samples (13),characterized in that in addition to the

close to each other as possible. 
A method as claimed in claim 1,characterized in that the faceplate of the

or a fiberoptic glass plate (45), is brought into contact 
with the protective film (14) of the sample (13). 
A method as claimed in claim 1 or 2,characterized in that the whole sample plate 
(13) is measured in parts which are combined into a single 

image, for example, with a computer so that the plate-like 
samples are analysed piece by piece like a mosaic. 
A method as claimed in claim 1, 2 or 3,characterized in that the measuring 
information given by the image detector (20) on the number, 

intensity and input time of the pulses is controlled by 
means of a second detector (30) so that opposite the image 

detector, on the opposite side of the sample, a detector is 
used for coincidence detection or otherwise for ensuring 

the correct functioning of the image detector.

support plate (11) can be moved horizontally with respect 
to the detector (20), and another mechanism by means of 

which the detector can be moved vertically into contact

first position-sensitive detector (20), on the opposite 
side of the sample, the said second detector being a
