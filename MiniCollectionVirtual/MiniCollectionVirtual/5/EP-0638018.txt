<ABSTRACT>
A pressing or pelletizing device for compacting vegetable materials, in particular grass blades, is disclosed for use specially with a harvester. In order to reduce the pressing forces required for the pelletizing process, the pressing channels are heated up to a temperature above 100  DEG C, preferably above 150  DEG C. It has been demonstrated that by heating the pressing channels, local overheating of the device, which could otherwise lead to malfunctions, can be avoided. Appropriately, the pelletizing device has two co-axial hollow cylinders (33) in which the pressing channels (51) are delimited by radial lands (39) which alternatively engage the pressing channels (51) of the other hollow cylinder (33). The hollow cylinders (33) are heated by means of a liquid circuit guided through the lands (39) and linked to a heat exchanger that utilizes the lost heat from the internal combustion engine of the harvester.

Device for pelletising vegetable material, especially 
grass and straw material, to form discrete pressed shapes, 

with two hollow rollers (33) which are mounted parallel to 
one another, are driven forcibly and in opposite directions 

to one another and interengage like toothed wheels with 
teeth (39) constructed in strip form, pressing channels (51) 

which lead radially to the interior of the hollow rollers 
(33) and narrow radially inwards, at least in places, being 

provided between the teeth (39) of the said hollow rollers, 
wherein the material to be compressed is delivered by means 

of a screw conveyor (17) or the like into the circumferential 
nip of the hollow rollers (33) on the inlet side, is 

compacted by the radial pressing channels (51) and in the 
interior (41) of the hollow rollers (33) is broken off and 

discharged in the axial direction from the interior (41), 
characterised in that the teeth (39) consist of lands (39) 

which are elongated in the radial and axial directions and 
can be heated and which are also connected to two flange 

bodies (43, 49) disposed coaxially and spaced from one 
another, the said lands forming between them radially 

extending shafts (51) as pressing channels, and the hollow 
rollers (33) are surrounded by a housing (27). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
lands (39) are releasably connected to the flange bodies 

(43, 49). 
Device according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that the lands (39) have bores (57, 72) with parallel axes 

for connection to pipes for the heating medium. 
Device according to Claim 1 or one of the following 
claims, characterised in that the housing (27) surrounding 

the hollow rollers (33) is constructed so that it can be  
 

heated, and in particular is provided with bores (65) for 
connection to pipes for the heating medium. 
Device according to Claim 1 or one of the following 
claims, characterised in that the pelletising device is a 

component part of a vehicle, particularly a self-driving 
harvester, with the aid of which the vegetable material can 

be mown, picked up, comminuted, conveyed, pressed and 
binned. 
Device according to Claim 1 or the following claims, 
characterised in that the lands (39) and/or the housing (27) 

can be heated by the waste heat from an internal combustion 
engine (5) of the harvester, and are for example connected 

to the cooling circuit thereof. 
Device according to Claim 1 or the following claims, 
characterised in that the bars (39) and/or the housing (27) 

are heated to at least 100°C, preferably to more than 150°C. 
Device according to Claim 1 or the following claims, 
characterised in that the lands (39) and/or the housing (27) 

can be heated by the exhaust gases from an internal combustion 
engine (5). 
Device according to Claim 1 of one of the following 
claims, characterised in that the radial length (50) of the 

lands (39) is substantially greater than the depth of penetration 
(52) of the lands (39) into the associated shafts 

(51). 
Device, particularly according to Claim 1 or one of 
the following claims, characterised in that a clearance (40, 

42) which widens in the direction of movement of the lands 
is provided between the inner surface of the housing (27, 

30) and the outermost rotational path of the lands (39).  
 
Device, particularly according to Claim 1 or one of 
the following claims, characterised in that the outer end 

regions of the lands (39) are constructed as wear bars (54) 
and are releasably connected, especially screwed (56), to 

the lands (39). 
Device, particularly according to Claim 1 or one of 
the following claims, characterised in that the individual 

land (39) has different thicknesses over its radial length 
(50) in such a way that the land (39) widens (58, 60) radially 

from the outside inwards first of all more sharply and 
then less markedly in a wedge shape, whereupon it tapers 

(62) in a wedge shape. 
Device, particularly according to Claim 1 or one of 
the following claims, characterised in that radially extending 

longitudinal grooves (66) are provided in the outer 
surfaces of the lands. 
Device according to Claim 1 or one of the following 
claims, characterised in that a wedge-shaped component (36) 

of the housing (27, 28, 30) projects into the nip of the 
hollow rollers (33) on the outlet side, the outer surface 

(38) of the said component being in sliding frictional 
contact with the outer surfaces (70) of the lands (39). 
Device, particularly according to Claim 1 or one of 
the following claims, characterised in that the individual 

pressing channel (51) has passing through it at least one 
partition (83) which is disposed transversely with respect
