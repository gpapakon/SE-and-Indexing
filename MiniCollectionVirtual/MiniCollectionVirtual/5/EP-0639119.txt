<ABSTRACT>
A machine-tool has a spindle carrier (111) and at least one tool changer (120). The tool changer (120) conveys machining tools (116) between a storage position and a working position. At least one hydraulically controllable working cylinder (1) is associated thereto as a driving unit (123). The working cylinder (1) contains an axially movable piston provided with an end-position fluid damping device. An adjustment device associated to the working cylinder (1) allows the end-position damping device to be switched between at least two setting values.

<CLAIMS>
Machine tool (100) with a headstock (111) and one or more 
tool changers (120) for transferring machining tools between a 

magazine position and a working position, wherein the tool 
changer (120) is assigned as drive unit (123) one or more fluid-actuable 

operating cylinders (1) with a cylinder housing (2) in 
which an operating piston
 (6) is mounted with axial movement 
facility and with a damping device provided for its fluidic end-position 

damping, characterized in that the operating cylinder 
(1) is assigned a setting device, through which the end-position 

damping may be switched between at least two presettings. 
Machine tool according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
setting device (51) is mounted on the operating cylinder (1). 
Machine tool according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that 
the working principle of the damping device (16) is based on an 

increase in the fluid force acting on the piston against the 
momentary direction of stroke after a defined piston position, 

which generates a braking movement with reduced piston velocity 
relative to the preceding normal velocity. 
Machine tool according to any of claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the setting device (51) communicates with an outflow 

passage (34, 35) which is connected or connectable to an outflow-side 
working space (7, 8) of the operating cylinder (1), that 

pressure medium flowing out of this outflow-side working space 
(7, 8) flows out via the setting device (51), with the setting 

device (51) being switchable between at least two velocity 
presettings, in which the outflowing pressure medium is subject 

to differing flow resistances, which are effective for both the 
normal movement proceeding at normal velocity and also for the 

braking movement of the piston (6).  
 
Machine tool according to any of claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that the end-position damping is generated by a reduction in 

the outflow cross-section available for the pressure medium 
displaced by the piston from the outflow-side working space 

(7, 8). 
Machine tool according to any of claims 1 to 5, characterized 
in that the setting device (51) is switchable directly manually 

and/or by remote control through the agency of one or more 
actuating devices (68) working in conjunction with the setting 

device (51) and in particular mounted on the setting device (51). 
Machine tool according to any of claims 1 to 6, characterized 
in that the setting device (51) has an adjustable slide (63) 

which may be positioned in various slide positions to obtain the 
individual velocity presettings. 
Machine tool according to claim 7, characterized in that the 
setting device (51) has a setting passage (55, 55') connected to 

the outflow passage (34, 35), in which the slide is interposed, 
so that the outflowing pressure medium passes the slide (63), 

with the slide (63) having different control sections (64, 64'; 
65, 65') for the individual velocity presettings, which may be 

positioned consecutively in the area of the setting passage (55, 
55') and generate flow cross-sections of varying size in the 

setting passage (55, 55'). 
Machine tool according to claim 8, characterized in that the 
slide (63) is a piston slide, in which the control sections (64, 

64'; 65, 65') are formed by sections of varying slide cross-section 
in particular in the form of circumferential grooves of 

varying depth.  
 
Machine tool according to any of claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that a sound absorber (56), through which the 

pressure medium flowing out via the setting device (51) is 
directed, is mounted directly on the setting device (51). 
Machine tool according to claim 10 in conjunction with claim 
8 or 9, characterized in that the sound absorber is connected to 

the end section of the respective setting passage (55, 55') 
opposite the outflow passage (34, 35). 
Machine tool according to any of claims 1 to 11, 
characterized in that the setting device (51) communicates 

simultaneously with two outflow passages (34, 35), each connected 
or connectable to one of the two working spaces (7, 8) divided 

by the piston (6), while each velocity presetting simultaneously 
gives the flow resistances for both directions of stroke (22, 26) 

of the piston (6). 
Machine tool according to claim 12, characterized in that 
two setting passages (55, 55') are provided in the setting device 

(51), each communicating on the input side with one of the two 
outflow passages (34, 35).

the setting device (51), to which a sound absorber is expediently 
connected. 
Machine tool according to any of claims 4 to 14, 
characterized in that a fixed restrictor (58) is provided in the 

outflow passage (34, 35), with the amount of flow resistance 
which it generates lying between two flow resistances presettable
