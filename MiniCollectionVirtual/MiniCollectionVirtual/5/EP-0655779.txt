<ABSTRACT>
A method of forming solder bumps (56) for 
use as terminals of an integrated circuit flip chip 

encompasses the use of a photoresist (52) which can be 
selectively patterned (54) with known photoengraving 

techniques, through which a preformulated solder 
composition can be accurately and selectively 

deposited on the surface (50) of the flip chip. A dry 
film photoresist (52) is used as a mask to apply a 

solder paste (56), such that precise registration, 
fine pitch bump arrays, and precise bump size control 

are possible. Precise control of the composition of 
the solder bumps (58) is also enabled, which relies on 

processing techniques which minimise processing costs. 
The process does not generate chlorofluorocarbons.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
forming solder bumps on an integrated circuit flip 
chip for use, for example as terminals used to secure 
and electrically interconnect an integrated circuit 
chip to a circuit board, such as a ceramic substrate 
or printed wiring board. Integrated circuit chips are typically 
soldered to conductor patterns on a circuit board, 
which may be a ceramic substrate or printed wiring 
board, in a manner which both secures and electrically 
interconnects the integrated circuit chip to the 
circuit board. Due to the numerous functions 
performed by integrated circuits, a relatively large 
number of terminals are required. Furthermore, 
because the size of typical integrated circuit chips 
is generally on the order of a few millimetres per 
side, the size and spacing of the terminals must be 
closely controlled in order properly to align and 
mount an integrated circuit chip to the corresponding 
conductor pattern formed on the circuit board. A method which is widely practised for 
soldering integrated circuit chips to a substrate is 
the flip-chip bonding process. This process utilises 
an integrated circuit chip, or flip chip, which is 
generally a monolithic semiconductor device having 
bead-like terminals provided on one face of the chip. 
The terminals, or solder bumps, serve as connections 
between the integrated circuit chip and its 
corresponding conductor pattern. Flip chip conductor 
patterns are composed of numerous individual 
conductors, often as small as about 0.10 millimetres 
in width, and spaced as little as about 0.20 
millimetres centre-to-centre. As a result, soldering  
 
an integrated circuit flip chip to its conductor 
pattern requires a significant degree of precision. 
The size and composition of the solder bumps must also 
be closely controlled to achieve the required 
reliability, bond integrity and electrical 
characteristics, while concurrently eliminating the 
potential for electrical shorting between adjacent 
solder bumps. Various techniques have been employed to 
form solder bumps on flip chips, each of which having 
its own specific advantages. One such method is a 
plating process which involves the electrodeposition 
of a suitable solder composition on the flip chip. As 
illustrated in Figure 1, the steps typically involved 
to produce a solder bump 12 by this process include 
spinning a photoresist film 14 on a substrate 10 to a 
thickness of about 2 to about 25 micrometres. The 
photoresist film 14 is then photoengraved to form
