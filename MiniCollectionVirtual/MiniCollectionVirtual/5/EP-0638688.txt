<ABSTRACT>
The device includes a tube (5) designed to be placed in the foundations around the said upper part of the reinforcement and to be sealed into the foundation, means (8-14) for temporarily exerting compression on the reinforcement (1) inside the tube (5) and means (15, 17) for introducing into the tube, around the compressed reinforcement, a slurry for sealing the micro-pile into the tube. The invention applies particularly to the micro-pile used by way of an element for underpinning existing buildings and constructions.

Device for producing a prestressed micropile 
intended to support a foundation, which comprises: 


a borehole (6) in the foundation (F), 
a tube (5) to be inserted into the borehole, 
a settable grout (7) to be injected between the 
tube and the wall of the borehole in order to bed the 

tube in the foundation, 
a reinforcement (1) having a lower part (la) to 
be introduced into the ground underlying the foundation 

and an upper part (1c) to be introduced into the tube, 
a bedding grout (2) to be injected around the 
lower part (1a) of the reinforcement in order to bed it 

into the ground, 
means (8-13) for momentarily exerting 
compression on the reinforcement, 
a transfer means (11) for transferring the 
reaction to the compression of the reinforcement to the 

foundation via the tube, 
 
characterized in that it comprises a settable bedding 

material and means (15, 17) for injecting this material 
into the space (16) between the upper part of the reinforcement 

and the tube so that this material beds the 
reinforcement in the tube and constitutes the said 

transfer means. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the means for exerting compression on the reinforcement 

(1) of the micropile in the tube comprise a seal (8, 
9) placed around the reinforcement in the tube (5), means 

(10) for creating, in the tube, a sealed chamber (11) 
above this seal and above the reinforcement, and means  

 
(12) for injecting a pressurized fluid into this chamber 

(11). 
Device according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the means for creating the said sealed chamber 

comprise a cap (10) screwed onto the upper end of the 
tube (5) and equipped with a connector (14) for connecting 

it to a hydraulic power unit (13). 
Device according to Claim 2 or 3, characterized 
in that the means for injecting a bedding grout into the 

space (16) lying between the tube (5) and the reinforcement 
(1) comprise a pipe (15) which is connected to a 

source of grout and which terminates in the tube beneath 
the said seal (8, 9) and a pipe (17) for removing the air 

from the said space (16) beneath the said seal. 
Prestressed micropile for supporting a 
foundation, which comprises a tube (5) placed in a 

borehole (6) made in the foundation (F) and bedded in the 
wall of the borehole by a cured bedding grout (7), a 

reinforcement (1) having a lower part (la) bedded in the 
ground underlying the foundation and an upper part (1c) 

which passes into the tube (5) and which is compressed, 
a cured material in the space (16) between this upper 

part (1c) and the tube and a transfer means (11) for 
transferring the reaction to the compression of the 

reinforcement to the foundation via the tube, 
characterized in that this cured material ensures that 

the reinforcement is bedded in the tube so as to constitute 
the said transfer means. 
Prestressed micropile according to Claim 5, 
characterized in that the said reinforcement (1) of the 

micropile is tubular.
