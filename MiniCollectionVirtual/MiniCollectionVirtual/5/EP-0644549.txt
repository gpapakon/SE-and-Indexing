<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a semiconductor 
memory circuit which can restrict the increase of an 

operation current in a flash write mode to a minimum even 
when there are problems caused in the manufacturing 

process such as short-circuits in the wiring. A timing 
control circuit of the semiconductor memory circuit of 

the present invention comprises an FW latch signal generation 
circuit and a latch circuit both for detecting that 

a row address strobe signal, an 
RAS
 signal and a flash 
write enable signal inputted have become active, and an 

FW gate signal generation circuit for activating the FW 
gate signal for only a limited fixed time determined by a 

delay circuit when an FW gate activation signal is outputted 
from the latch circuit which has detected the 

activation of both signals. With the FW gate signal 
activated, the flash write gate switch turns active for 

performing the flash write activity. After the flash 
write activity is finished, the FW gate signal becomes 

inactive immediately even when the 
RAS
 signal is 
active.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor memory
circuit, particularly to a semiconductor memory circuit
in which data for one word can be written in a corresponding
amount of memory cells in one access activity.Hitherto, in semiconductor memory circuits of this type,
a flash write gate (hereinafter referred to as an FW
gate) has been activated or inactivated in synchronization
with a trailing edge or leading edge of a row
address strobe (hereinafter referred to as RAS, where
the sign <-> shows that signals or terminals are active
when they are at a low logic level), thereby performing
an FW function of the semiconductor memory circuit. (For
example, reference may be made to Japanese Patent Laid-open
No. 29987/90, EP 337 172 A2 discloses a static RAM in which the write gates are turned on only for a predetermined period of time to thereby limit power consumption.The structure and operation of an example of a semiconductor
memory circuit of the conventional type will be
described with reference to Fig. 1 to Fig. 4. Fig. 1 is
a block diagram showing the structure of an example of
the conventional type, and Fig. 2 is a circuit 
diagram showing a principal part of the diagram of Fig.
1. In Fig. 1, a row address decoder 308 is connected on
one side to a memory cell array 306 through word lines
309 (WL1, WL2, ...), and on the other side to a row
address buffer 307. Address data are supplied to the row
address buffer 307 through address pins A1 to An. Also,
to the bit lines on the column side of the memory cell
array 306, there are connected a sense amplifier 310
(SA1, SA2, ... in Fig. 2), a column switch 301 (Q1, Q1',
Q2, Q2', ... in Fig. 2), and an FW gate 304 (SW1,
SW2, ... in Fig. 2). A column address buffer 313 is connected
to a column address decoder 311, which is in turn
connected to the column switch 301. Address data are
inputted to the column address buffer 313 through the
address pins A1 to An.Further, the column switch 301 is connected through
input/output buses 302, 303 to a data latch circuit 314,
which is in turn connected to an input/output terminal
317 (hereinafter referred to as an I/O terminal 317).
The FW gate 304 is connected to the data latch circuit
314 through a flash write data bus 305 (hereinafter
referred to as an FW data bus 305). The FW gate 304, row
address buffer 307, row address decoder 308, sense amplifier
310, row address decoder 311, column address buffer
313 and data latch circuit 314 are controlled by various
signals to be inputted to a controller 315, for example,
