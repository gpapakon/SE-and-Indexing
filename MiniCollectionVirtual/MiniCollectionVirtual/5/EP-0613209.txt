<ABSTRACT>
In order to achieve two-way communications at two 
different frequencies, an impedance matching circuit (20) is 

coupled to an antenna (22). The circuit includes a first 
inductor which is directly coupled to the antenna. The 

first inductor induces antenna input impedance to be 
capacitive at a first resonant frequency and induces the 

antenna input impedance to be inductive at a second 
resonant frequency. The first resonant frequency is 

lower than the second resonant frequency. Further, a 
first capacitor is coupled to the first inductor. By 

providing the first capacitor, a reactance component at 
the first resonant frequency is render
ed substantially 
equal to a reactance component at the second resonant 

frequency/ Further, the circuit includes a second 
inductor and a second capacitor which are coupled between 

the second means and a feeder. The combination of the 
second inductor and the second capacitor is provided to 

adjust impedance, defined by the antenna and the first 
inductor and the first capacitor, to characteristic 

impedance of the feeder at the first and second resonant 
frequencies.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to an
electronic circuit coupled to an antenna for impedance
matching, and more specifically to such a circuit for
impedance matching between an antenna and a feeder at two
resonant freqencies via which two-way communications are
established. The present invention is well suited for an
antenna which is mounted on a portable radio telephone
unit and thus required to be small in size.In recent years, a large number of handheld portable
radio telephone units have been widely used and this
tendency is ever increasing. A portable radio telephone
unit communicates with a base station via two channels
and thus requires an antenna to resonate at two different
frequencies.Before turning to the present invention it is
preferable to briefly discuss, with reference to Fig. 1,
a known antenna which resonates at two different
frequencies. This prior art is disclosed in Japanese
Laid-open Patent Application No. 63-286008 on November
22, 1988.As shown in Fig. 1, an antenna depicted by numeral
10 is provided with two antenna elements 12 and 14 which
resonate respectively at different frequencies f1 and f2
(f1<f2). The element 12 has a rod-like configuration
while the other element 14 takes the form of a coil. One
end of the coil 14 is electrically coupled to the top of
the element 12. In order to electrically insulate the
two antenna elements 12 and 14, an insulator tube 16 is
provided between the two elements 12 and 14. The element 12 is λ1/2 long (where λ1 is a wavelength
of the resonant frequency f1). The coil 14 extends on the
top portion of the element 12 over a distance (λ1-λ2) and
has a stretched length of λ2/4 (where λ2 is a wavelength
of the resonant frequency f2).The antenna assembly 10 has one end coupled to an
impedance matching circuit 17 which is in turn coupled,
via a feeder 18, to a front end (not shown) of a handheld
portable unit (not shown).In order to achieve better portability, a handheld
mobile unit antenna can be accommodated in the unit case
when it is not used. However, it is difficult for the
antenna of Fig. 1 to be contained in a unit case when it
is not used in that the antenna 10 has a bulky top
portion.EP-0 531 125 A3 has been published after the priority date
of the present specification. It relates to the radio
transceiver having an improved impedance matching
characteristics between a rod-like antenna and transmitting
and receiving portions thereof. The impedance matching
circuit includes a first inductor inserted between the
antenna and a

for impedance matching at a first resonant frequency and at a second resonant

frequency, comprising:

the total impedance of said antenna and said inductor to be capacitive at said first
