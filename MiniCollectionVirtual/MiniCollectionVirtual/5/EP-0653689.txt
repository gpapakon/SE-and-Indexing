<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of simulating
running conditions of a vehicle according to the pre-characterizing
portion of claim 1 and to a vehicle load
simulator according to the pre-characterizing portion of
claim 4.The invention starts from a prior-art vehicle load
simulator and a method of simulating running conditions by
use of said known vehicle load simulator. Said method
comprises the steps of: actually running a vehicle (a motor-bicycle,
automatic four-wheeled vehicle or the like);
recording the vibration waveform applied to the vehicle as
actual vibration waveform data; and applying, on the basis of
the recorded actual vibration waveform data, the same
vibration as that applied to the actual running vehicle to
the vehicle mounted on a testing base (vehicle load
simulator) by means of an oscillator.A vehicle vibration test is performed as follows:
First, a vibration applied to a vehicle running along a road
surface is detected by an acceleration detecting device, and
the detected acceleration is recorded in a data recorder. In 
the load simulation by a vehicle simulator, on the basis of
the vibration data thus collected, a vibration is applied to
the vehicle mounted on a testing base by way of the axle
shaft or wheels of the vehicle by an oscillator. As for the
oscillation by the oscillator in this vehicle vibration test,
a transmission function of a system including the oscillator,
vehicle and acceleration detecting device is obtained by
repeating trial oscillation; an oscillation control signal is
obtained on the basis of the transmission function and the
collected actual vibration waveform; and the same vibration
as that applied to the actually running vehicle is applied to
the vehicle by the oscillator while controlling the
oscillation on the basis of the oscillation control signal.
In addition, at the time of both actual running and testing
oscillation, the same acceleration detecting device is used.In the above-described load simulation by the vehicle
load simulator, the reproduction of a vertical vibration
applied to an actually running vehicle is generally performed
by recording the acceleration of the actually running vehicle
by an acceleration detecting device attached near the axle
shaft of the vehicle, and applying, to the vehicle mounted on
a testing base, the same vibration as that with the vibration
waveform thus recorded. On the other hand, it may be considered that a
differential transformer or a velocity meter is used for
detecting the vibration of a vehicle.
