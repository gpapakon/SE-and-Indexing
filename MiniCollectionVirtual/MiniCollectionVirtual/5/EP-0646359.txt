<ABSTRACT>
A laser balloon catheter (10) for emitting in a balloon, laser 
lights which are transmitted through optical fibers and for 

irradiating the tissue with the laser lights transmitted through 
the balloon comprises laser light emitting means having a laser 

light emitting end of said optical fibers or a laser light 
transmittable member provided at the emitting end of the optical 

fibers which receives the laser lights to emit them, a first 
inflatable balloon (1) provided around said light emitting means for 

transmitting the laser lights from said emitting means toward the 
tissue, a first fluid passage for supplying fluid into said first 

balloon to inflate the same and for discharging the fluid 
therefrom to deflate the same, a second inflatable balloon (2) 

provided in front of said first balloon, a second fluid passage 
for supplying the fluid into said second balloon to inflate the 

same and for discharging the fluid therefrom to deflate the same.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a laser balloon catheter
which is inserted into the body cavities such as the gullet, the
stomach and the prostate for the laser treatment thereof.Laser balloon catheters are used for opening the clogged
portions of the blood vessels. Hyperthermia treatment using the
laser balloon catheters for irradiating the cancer tissues with
laser lights are conducted.The structure of such type of the laser balloon catheters
is disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 4,512,762. In this
U.S. Patent, a lumen tube surrounding optical fibers is provided
and a balloon is provided at the front end of the optical fibers
to surround the front end thereof.Another structure of the catheter in which a balloon is
provided with an acoustic sensor for controlling the vaporization
of the tissue is disclosed in U.S.P.No 4,799,479.A catheter in which a tube member is provided at the front
end of a balloon and liquid is caused to flow through a through-hole
formed on the tube member is disclosed in U.S.P No 
4,878,492.Another kind of laser balloon catheter for the opening of
clogged portions of vessels containing body fluid is described
in the EP-A- 0 448 004 A2. The catheter disclosed therein
contains two inflatable balloons which are disposed at both
sides of the clogged portion of the vessel. The inflated
balloons serve as means for sealing off the enclosed portion of
the vessel so that that portion can be filled with a laser
light absorbing fluid. However, the field of application of
this catheter is limited. On the other side, the laser balloon catheter having only one balloon
may be unwantedly removed from the urethra or shifted while the
catheter is manipulated. Even if the balloon is preliminarily
set in the prostate, shifting of the balloon toward the entrance
of the urethra may cause the sphincter muscle to be irradiated
with laser lights, resulting in thermal damage to the sphincter
muscle.It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to
provide a laser balloon catheter which can be set in position,
and thus is capable of irradiating only a desired portion of the
prostate with laser lights and of preventing the sphincter muscle
from being damaged due to removal of the catheter from the
urethra and shifting of the catheter toward the entrance of the
urethra.It is another object of the present invention to provide a
laser balloon catheter which can discharge urine externally
through the catheter when urination occurs during treatment.In order to overcome the above mentioned
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A laser balloon catheter for emitting in a balloon,
laser lights which are transmitted through optical fibers (38) and for

irradiating the tissue with the laser lights transmitted through
the balloon, comprising


laser light emitting means (38A) having a laser light emitting end
of said optical fibers or a laser light transmittable member

provided at the emitting end of the optical fibers which receives
the laser lights to emit them;
