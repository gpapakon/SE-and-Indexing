<ABSTRACT>
Quick-connection adaptor allowing the sealed coupling of a rigid tube (1) provided, some distance from its free end (1b) intended to be fitted into the entrance (2a) of the adaptor, with a bead (1a) projecting radially relative to the external surface of the tube and exhibiting a substantially radial flank (1c) opposite the said end. The adaptor has a first internal housing comprising an annular seal (6) capable of coming into contact with the external surface of the tube between its free end and its bead and a second internal housing (3a) to accommodate a locking ring (4) elastically deformable in the radial direction. The locking ring (4) is formed by a thin metal strip exhibiting an overall oblong profile, the central region of the said ring consisting of substantially cylindrical portions (4a-4b), the diameter of which in the free state is at most equal to the diameter of the tube (1). The zone situated at one end of the major diameter of the oblong profile consists of a bridge (4c) in the shape of inverted U, the base of which essentially forms a part projecting radially outside the body of the adaptor.

Connector of a quick connection allowing tight connection of a
rigid tube 
(1) provided, at some distance from its free end (1b) intended to
be fitted in the inlet (2a) of the connector, with a bead (la) projecting

radially with respect to the outer surface of the tube and presenting a
substantially radial side (1d) opposite said end, said connector presenting

a first inner housing comprising an O-ring (6) capable of coming into
contact with the outer surface of the tube between its free end and its

bead and a second inner housing (3a) to receive a locking ring (4)
elastically deformable in the radial direction, said ring comprising at least

one zone projecting radially on the outer surface of the connector through
an opening made therein, the central region of said ring being constituted

by substantially cylindrical portions (4a-4b) whose diameter in the free
state is at the most equal to the diameter of the tube (1), characterised in

that the locking ring (4) is formed by a thin metal band wound on itself so
as to present a closed profile, both ends of said band being fixed to each

other, said ring presenting a generally oblong profile and said zone
projecting radially outside the connector being located at an end of the

large diameter of the oblong profile and in that the zone of this ring
projecting radially outside the connector is constituted by a bridge in the

form of an upturned U (4c) whose base essentially forms the part radially
projecting outside the body of the connector.
The connector according to Claim 1, characterised in that the
locking ring comprises two zones (4c-4d) projecting radially outside the

connector and disposed respectively at each of the ends of the large
diameter of the ring.
The connector according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that
the front edges (4e-4f) of the locking ring are widened, at least in the

region of the cylindrical portions (4a-4b).
The connector according to any one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that it comprises a slidably mounted permanent locking

indicator (9) constituted by a rigid ring (9a) whose inner diameter is at
least equal to the outer diameter of the tube but less than the outer

diameter of its bearing side (1d) on the locking ring, said ring presenting,
on its outer periphery, at least one tab (9c) extending axially and engaged 

beneath the base of the bridge (4c) of the ring through an opening (3c) of
the connector, the axial length of said tab being such that its free end is

visible beyond the bridge when the tube is not locked in the connection
but disappears when the tube is locked.
The connector according to Claim 4, characterised in that the
ring (59a) of the permanent locking indicator presents two tabs (59c)

diametrally opposite each other, the free end of each tab comprising a
radial fold (59e).
The connector according to Claim 5, characterised in that it
comprises a complementary locking indicator, said indicator being

detachable and likewise constituted by a ring (60) whose C-section
presents a groove (60a) capable of receiving the radial fold (59e) of the

tabs (59c).
The connector according to any one of Claims 4 to 6,
characterised in that the ring forming the permanent locking indicator (9,

19, 29) is provided with elastic means (9c, 19c, 29f) abutting on the
connector to push the ring permanently towards the inlet of the connector.
The connector according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that it
comprises a bearing washer (40) disposed to the rear of the locking ring

(4) with respect to the inlet (32a) of the connector and slidably mounted in
the connector between an active position and an inactive position, said

washer presenting at least two diametrally opposite bearing zones (40a)
for the cylindrical portions (4a-4b) of the locking ring, the diameter

separating said zones being at least equal to the diameter of the bead of
the tube to be fitted in the connector, while the inner diameter of the

washer is less than the diameter of said bead.
The connector according to any one of Claims 1 to 8,
characterised in that the or each opening (43c) of the connector for the

passage of the or each bridge (44c) of the locking ring presents lateral
edges (43'c) projecting radially to prevent manual action on the base of

the bridge.
The connector according to any one of Claims 1 to 9,
characterised in that, on the locking ring (44), at least one of the arms of

the bridge (44c) presents, in its zone projecting outwardly of the
connector, a fold (44'c) or the like capable of abutting, in the position of

locking of the ring, on the outer face of the wall (43) of the connector.
