<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a robot for moving an object from a
movable body, and particularly to a robot suitable for ejecting a molded product
from dies of a molding machine.The ejectors for ejecting molded products from injection molding
machines are generally separated into the following two types.The ejector of the first type starts the ejection of a molded product when
dies of a molding machine are fully opened. On the contrary, the ejector of the
second type starts the ejection of a molded product according to the opening action
of dies of a molding machine by way of a mechanical cam. An example of such a
second type of ejector is disclose in US-A-4 368 018, with respect to which claim
1 is delimited.In the ejector of the first type, however, the ejection takes a long time
because it starts after dies of a molding machine are fully opened.The ejector of the second type is expected to eject a molded product more
rapidly than the ejector of the first type; however, it occasionally takes a time
longer compared with the ejector of the first type.The ejection time described above means a time elapsed between the full
opening and the full closing of dies of a molding machine.The reason why the ejector of the second type takes a longer time is that,
since being moved using a power for moving dies of a molding machine, the
ejector of this type is suppressed in its moving speed depending on the magnitude
of the power for moving the dies of the molding machine. Moreover, the ejector of
the second type has a disadvantage in that it is not stopped directly after dies are
stopped and also not stopped at a specified position because of a large inertia of the
ejector. Additionally, in the case of changing the cam curve for actuating the
mechanical cam, the cam must be replaced; accordingly, the cam curve cannot be
easily changed, which makes it difficult to achieve the optimization of the ejection.An object of the present invention is to provide a robot capable of
handling an object such as a molded product for a short time, and of easily
changing the cam curve according to the ejecting status.Another object of the present invention is to provide an ejecting robot
capable of simplifying the structure and reducing the weight, and of handling an
object such as a molded product for a short time; and to provide an ejecting
method using the ejecting robot.To achieve the above object, according to the first aspect of the present
invention, there is provided an industrial robot for effecting repetitive molding
ope
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An industrial robot for effecting repetitive molding operations,
comprising :


molding bodies composed of two members (12, 14) which are
driveable between closed and opened positions by a relative displacement thereof

along a predetermined axial direction (Z), respectively to contain an object (F) to
be molded and to release said object,
holding means (200) for holding said object (F),
first drive means (300) for effecting said relative displacement of said
two members,
guide means (207, 299) for guiding a displacement of said holding
means along a path having a linear component extending along said predetermined

axial direction (Z) and an arcuate component following a path passing between
