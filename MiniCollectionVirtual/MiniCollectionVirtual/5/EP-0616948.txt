<ABSTRACT>
A freezing mould bag (10) comprises two sheets (12, 14) which are 
joined together in substantially overlapping relationship along the periphery 

of the sheets, defining a plurality of mould compartments (24) 
within the interior of the freezing mould bag. An inlet channel defined 

by joints (28, 30, 32) extends from the mould compartments (24) to an 
inlet opening (26). Two closure valve flaps (16, 18) are connected to 

the sheets (12, 14) at the inlet opening (26) and extend from the inlet 
opening within the inlet channel. The inlet channel comprises a first 

and a second segment, which first segment is of a configuration tapering 
from the inlet opening (26) towards the mould compartments, and which 

second segment has dimensions so as to to no substantial extent hinder 
liquid or water from flowing through the second segment. At the transition 

between the first and the second segment of the inlet channel, a 
constriction is defined, serving the purpose of generating a venturi 

effect for generating a relative pressure drop within the constriction 
for closing the inlet channel at the constriction as liquid or water is 

flowing from the second segment of the inlet channel through the constriction 
towards the first segment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a freezing mould bag, especially
for freezing ice lumps or ice cubes, and more precisely a freezing mould
bag providing a self-closing effect, and comprising:
two sheets of a foil material, said sheets being of substantially
identical geometrical shape and defining an outer periphery,a peripheral joint extending along the majority of said outer periphery
of said sheets, except for a peripheral area constituting an inlet
opening of said bag, said peripheral joint joining said sheets together
in substantially overlapping relationship and defining an inner
space within the interior of said bag, said inner space constituting at
least one mould compartment, and preferably a plurality of mould compartments
being interconnected and being defined by separate joints of
said sheets,an inlet channel defined by separate joints of said sheets and extending
from said inner space of said bag to said inlet opening so as to
provide access from the environment to said inner space of said bag
through said inlet channel,two closure valve flaps connected to said sheets at said inlet
opening and extending from said inlet opening within the interior of
said bag towards said inner space of said bag along said inlet channel,
said closure valve flaps being joined together and being joined to said
sheets through said separate joints defining said inlet channel so as to
provide two closure pockets being open towards said inner space of said
bag,said inlet channel comprising a first segment and a second segment,
said first segment being provided adjacent to said inlet opening, and
said second segment interconnecting said first segment and said mould
compartment or mould compartments, said first segment tapering towards
said second segment, said first segment and said second segment defining
at their transition a constriction,said inlet channel defining a first direction constituting the longitudinal
direction of said inlet channel, and a second direction in a
plane parallel with said two sheets perpendicular to said first
direction, and said closure valve flaps extending from said inlet opening beyond
said constriction at said transition,Numerous freezing mould bags are known within the art, e.g. from US
Patent No. 3,207,420, Re-issued US Patent No. 31,890, US Patent No.
