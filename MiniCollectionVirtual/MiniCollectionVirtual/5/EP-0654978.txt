<ABSTRACT>
An artificial insemination and embryo transfer device comprises an elongate hollow tube (30), and a hollow straw (38) containing a reproductive organism therein and fitted in the elongate tube (30). A flexible tip (34) is secured to an end of the elongate tube (30) and engaged with the straw (38). The tip (34) has a passage (52) in communication with the straw (38) and a conical portion (48) adapted to smoothly pass it through a cervical canal of a female subject. A piston rod (40) is slidably mounted in the elongate tube (30) and constructed to enter into the straw (38) so as to discharge the reproductive organism contained in the straw (38) though the passage (52) of the tip (34) by its axial advancement. A locking element is disposed between the elongate tube (30) and the piston rod (40) for restraining a free axial mouvement of the piston rod within the elongate tube (30). A first enclosure (102) is inserted around the elongate tube (30) so as to protect the elongate tube (30) against contamination from infectious materials in the cervical canal during the passing of the device through the cervical canal. A second enclosure (44) surrounds the tip (34) and the first enclosure (102) for preventing them from being contaminated from infectious materials in a vaginal canal during the insertion of the device into the vaginal canal.

<DESCRIPTION>
 ARTIFICIAL INSEMINATION AND EMBRYO TRANSFER DEVICEField of the InventionThe present invention relates to an instrument for artificial insemination or embryo transfer; and, more particularly, to a device for transferring a reproductive organism of a mammal such as semen or embryo into a genital organ of a female to provide artificial insemination or embryo transplantation.Description of the Prior ArtVarious technigues have been proposed to provide artificial insemination or embryo implantation in the reproductive systems of humans and animals(e. g., a cow), which are schematically represented in Figs. 1 and 2, showing a vagina 8, a cervical canal 2 and a uterine cavity 4. Usually, in order to enhance the rate of pregnancy by artificial insemination, sperms should be introduced to a rear zone of the cervical canal 2 or at a front zone 4a of the uterine cavity 4. In case of the embryo implantation, the embryo of the human should be deposited at a rear zone of the uterine cavity 4 and the embryo of the animal at a rearmost zone 6a of a uterine horn 6 so as to attain a better rate of conception. Particularly, care should be taken to avoid the contamination of the sperm or embryo during the artificial insemination or embryo implantation thereof. Generally, the artificial insemination is performed by a non-surgical technigue and the embryo transfer is done by a surgical or non-surgical technigue depending on the structural characteristics of the reproductive system of the subject or the level of operator's transplanting skill. In the latter case, it is recognized that the rate 

of pregnancy obtained by the laparotomy technique is higher than that by the non-surgical operation due to the more accurate deposition of the embryo in an optimum zone of the uterine horn and the ability to better control the embryo contamination. However, there exist various deficiencies in the surgical embryo transfer: the complicated and highly time consuming procedure, relatively high cost, and likelihood of increasing damages to the object. Further, it is difficult to perform repeatedly the embryo implantation on the same subject by using the surgical technique. For these reasons, the operators are reluctant to employ the surgical embryo transplantation.Accordingly, although the success rate of the non- surgical embryo transfer technique is somewhat lower, it is widely used to practice the embryo transfer on animals . In general, an instrument for performing the non-surgical artificial insemination or embryo transfer includes a
