<ABSTRACT>
The device serves for leak detection and is particularly suitable for the detection of acids. The device consists essentially of two electrical conductors which extend essentially parallel to each other and at a distance from each other. Together with a sleeving which can be penetrated by a liquid to be detected, the conductors form a detection cable. The sleeving is formed from a material which is exclusively selectively penetrable by at least one liquid to be detected. An internal construction of the detection cable is non-selectively penetrable by a plurality of liquids.

A device for leakage detection in the region of 
arrangements containing acids, which is essentially 

constructed from two electrical conductors (1, 4), and in 
which the conductors are constructed as an inner conductor 

(1) and an outer conductor (4) and are arranged coaxial to 
one another and together with a casing (5) which can be 

penetrated by a fluid to be detected form a detection cable, 
and in which the casing (5) is constructed from a material 

which can be exclusively selectively penetrated by at least 
one acid which is to be detected and in which an internal 

structure of the detection cable can be non-selectively 
penetrated by a plurality of acids, characterised in that 

the casing (5) encloses both conductors (1, 4) coaxially and 
a spacing element (3) extends between the inner conductor 

(1) and the outer conductor (4) and is constructed as an 
electrically non-conductive spiral. 
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the casing (5) can be dissolved by the fluid which is to be 

detected. 
A device according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that the casing (5) can be softened by the fluid which is to 

be detected. 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the casing (5) has filtering 

properties allowing through the fluid which is to be 
detected and blocking further fluids. 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the inner conductor (1) is enclosed by 

an insulation (2). 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the casing (5) is constructed so as to 

be acid-selective and water-resistant.  
 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the outer conductor (4) is constructed 

as a metal mesh. 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the casing (5) is enclosed by a net-like 

outer sleeve (6).
