<ABSTRACT>
There exists a closing device in which two slotted plates 1, 4, 5 are arranged parallel to one another and in which, in the open position, the slots 2 of the plates 1, 4, 5 are in alignment and, in the closed position, in each case webs 3 of the one plate cover slots 2 of the other plate, and also the plates lie tightly one against the other. It is desired here to ensure continuously adequate pressure-tightness in the closed position and to avoid the rubbing of the plates against one another upon displacement of the plates relative to one another. This is achieved in that the two plates 1, 4, 5 are connected to one another by means of articulated arms 8 arranged at the edges, which articulated arms are arranged obliquely inclined in one direction in the closed position and, during the transition of the plates into the open position, lift the latter off from one another. If the second slotted plate is displaced relative to the first, it also performs, in accordance with the radius of the articulated arm, a movement at right angles to the first plate, with the result that it lifts off from the first plate.

A closing device for an air passage, with which two slotted plates (1, 4, 5) are arranged
parallel to one another, one thereof being provided with a driving member (9) and being

movable to and fro in the direction of the plate plane in relation to the other, with which
in the open position, the slots (2) of the plates (1, 4, 5) are aligned and with which in the

closing position, fillets (13) of the one plate cover in each case slots of the other plate and
the plates lie close together, a plate frame bearing the fillets being provided, and with

which the plates (1, 4, 5) are connected to one another by articulated arms (8) arranged at
the edge thereof, these articulated arms (8) lifting the plates from one another when the

latter pass into the open position, characterised in that in the case of the movable plate
(4), the fillets (13) are separate parts from the plate frame (16) and are arranged below

the plate frame while being supported thereagainst by compression springs (21).
A closing device in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that the articulated arms
(8) connecting two adjacent plates (1, 4, 5) are articulated on both plates and in the

closing position of the plates are arranged inclined in one direction.
A closing device in accordance with Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that three slotted
plates (1, 4, 5) are provided and each of the two outer plates (1, 5) is connected to the

middle plate (4) by articulated arms (8).
A closing device in accordance with Claim 3, characterised in that one (1) of the two
outer plates (1, 5) is arranged so as to be stationary, the other outer plate (5) is slidable on

a guide (7) located at right angles to the plate plane, and the driving member (9) acts
upon the middle plate (4).
A closing device in accordance with any one of the preceding Claims, characterised in
that in the open position, the plates (1, 4, 5) lie close together and the articulated arms (8)

are arranged inclined in the opposite direction.
A closing device in accordance with any one of the preceding Claims, characterised in
that the spring prestressing force of the compression springs (21) is adjustable (20). 
A closing device in accordance with any one of the preceding Claims, characterised in
that the fixed plate (1) is coated with a sound-adsorbing compound on the side facing the

movable plate (4).
A closing device in accordance with any one of the preceding Claims, the fixed plate
being supported on a supporting piece and being fastened by screws, characterised in that

a sound-absorbent intermediate layer is inserted between the fixed plate (1) and the
supporting piece (11).
