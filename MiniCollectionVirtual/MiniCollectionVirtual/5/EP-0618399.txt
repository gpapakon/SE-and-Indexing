<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a microporous thermal insulation body comprising pressed thermal insulation material containing 30-100% by weight of finely divided metal oxide, 0-50% by weight of opacifier, 0-50% by weight of fibre material and 0-15% by weight of inorganic binder, characterised in that at least one surface of the shaped body contains channel pores having a cross-sectional area of the pore of 0.01-8 mm
<
2
>
 and having a penetration depth of 5-100%, based on the thickness of the shaped body, with from 0.004 to 10 channel pores being present per 1 cm
<
2
>
 of the surface of the shaped body.
