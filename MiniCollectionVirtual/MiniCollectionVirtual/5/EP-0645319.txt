<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to gift boxes and wrapping and more 
specifically to the combination of a gift box, a decorative bow and a display 
packaging for the same, which can be offered for sale as such in the retail stores for 
those who want to nicely "wrap" a gift prior to offering it. There is a fairly extensive prior art pertaining to the subject of gift 
boxes. Such boxes are typically made from stiff paperboard or the like, which is 
foldable either into a flat, envelope-like form, or in the form of a parallelepiped 
container. Such construction may or may not be designed to be sold within a 
display packaging. In U.S, patent No. 2,037, 515 issued to W.H. LEES on April 14, 1936, 
there is disclosed gift wrapping package that includes a ribbon card to stiffen it. The 
package is sold in a substantially flat form. In U.S. patent No. 3,829,008 issued to MURRAY et al on august 13, 
1974, there is disclosed a receptacle in the form of a parallelepiped container having 
foldable wrapping flaps secured to its underside. The wrapping flaps have reverse 
decorative sides which appear to the sight when they are folded up to wrap the 
container. The invention disclosed in this patent is limited to the container itself and 
does not disclose or suggest any display packaging for it. In U.S. patent No. 4,566,592 issued to KLUKOS on January 28, 1986, 
there is disclosed a packaging for flat, planar objects such as cards and lithographs. 
This packaging has a ribbon which sandwiches and holds the cards together. It is 
clearly limited to such planar objects. In U.S. patent No. 4,726,509 issued to FONAS on February 23, 1988, 
there is disclosed a gift wrapping which is laminated to a box and a system of tabs  
 
and slots to attach a decorative bow or rosette thereto. In U.S. patent No. 5,226,532 issued to DAVIDSON et al on July 13, 
1993, there is disclosed a container which is formed of a cutout blank foldable into 
a rectangular shape. In this patent, the gift must be inserted at one step of the 
folding operation. The object of the present invention is to provide a kit comprising, in 
combination, gift box, a decorative bow, an optional greeting card and a protective 
yet attractive display packaging for all these elements, which kit can be offered for 
sale in retail stores to those who want to easily and rapidly wrap a gift they just 
bought before offering it. More particularly, the invention as broadly claimed hereinafter, is 
directed to the combination of a gift box, a decorative bow and a display
