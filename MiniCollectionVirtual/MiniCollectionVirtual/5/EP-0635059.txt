 POLYSACCHARTOE BINDING FUSION PROTEINS AND CONJUGATESINTRODUCTIONTechnical FieldThis invention relates to novel removable labels comprising chimeric polypeptides and polypeptide conjugate-chemical moiety conjugates which are capable of binding to a polysaccharide matrix, and methods for their preparation and use.10BackgroundProduction of foreign proteins by expression in microbial systems can become a significant source of high value, medically important proteins. Purification and recovery of recombinant proteins are major considerations in the design of a15 fermentation process. While traditional means of protein purification can be used to isolate a product, improved means include the use of fusion proteins. Fusion proteins can be purified by affinity chromatography, the desired component of the fusion protein being purified by virtue of its covalent attachment to a polypeptide which binds to an affinity matrix. As an example, fusion proteins comprising a polypeptide20 of interest fused to jS-galactosidase can be purified using a p-amino-phenyl-/3-D-thio- galactoside-Sepharose column. Such a method has been used for purification of immunogenic polypeptides such as viral antigens. Staphylococcal protein A can also be used for affinity purification of fusion proteins by virtue of its specific binding to the Fc portion of immunoglobulins.25 In addition to purification, recovery of the original components from the fusion is often desirable. Both chemical and biological methods have been devised to cleave fusion proteins into their component polypeptides or segments.-f Introduction of acid-labile aspartyl-proline linkage between the two segments of a. fusion protein facilitates their separation at low pH. The major requirement of this30 system is that the desired segment of interest is not acid-labile. Fusion proteins comprising hormones such as insulin and somatostatin have been cleaved with 

cyanogen bromide, which is specific for the carboxyl side of methionine residues, to release the desired hormone. This method is not suitable when the desired protein contains methionine residues.Cleavage of fusion proteins by site-specific proteolysis has also been investigated. Fusion proteins into which a chicken pro α-2 collagen linker was inserted could be specifically degraded by purified microbial collagenase to release the components of the fusion protein. Other methods for purification and recovery of a desired recombinant protein include construction of a poly-arginine tail at the carboxyterminus of the
