<ABSTRACT>
A ring network, the ring nodes of which are constructed as add-and-drop multiplexers, is formed with purely optical components. On the optical fibre lines connecting the ring nodes, optical signals are transmitted in wavelength division multiplex. In the ring nodes, the optical signals are supplied wavelength-individually to a waveguide. According to the invention, the ring nodes are constructed in such a manner that a signal of one wavelength can both be switched through a ring node and extracted from the ring node. A signal injected into any node of the ring network can therefore be extracted at several ring nodes of the ring network.
