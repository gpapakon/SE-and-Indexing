<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the field of iron-binding
glycoproteins. More specifically, the present invention relates to
the recombinant production of human lactoferrin.Human lactoferrin (LF) is a member of the transferrin family
of iron-binding monomeric glycoproteins. It was originally discovered in
milk where it can reach levels of 7 grams/liter in colostrum. LF has since
been detected in other external fluids such as tears, saliva and mucosal
secretions and also in the secondary granules of polymorphonuclear
leukocytes.LF is a 78 kDa glycoprotein having a bilobal structure with
a high degree of homology between the C and N terminal halves which is
evident at both the amino acid and three dimensional structural level.
Each of these lobes can reversibly bind one ferric iron with high affinity
and with the concomitant binding of bicarbonate. The biological functions
proposed for lactoferrin include protection against microbial infection, 
enhanced intestinal iron absorption in infants, promotion of cell growth,
regulation of myelopoiesis and modulation of inflammatory responses.Filamentous fungi have been successfully employed as hosts
in the industriel production of extracellular glycoproteins. Certain
industrial strains are capable of secreting gram quantities of these
proteins. In addition, filamentous fungi are able to correctly perform post-translational
modifications of eucaryotic proteins and many strains have
U.S Food and Drug Administration approval. Furthermore, large scale
fermentation technology and downstream processing experience is
available.Currently, there is no efficient and economical way to
produce human LF. Consequently, a long felt need and description in this
art would be met by the development of an efficient method for the
production of human lactoferrin for nutritional and therapeutic
applications and for further investigation into its mechanism of action.In one embodiment, the present invention provides for a
recombinant plasmid comprising the cDNA of human lactoferrin. The
plasmid of the present invention is adapted for expression in an Aspergillus fungal
cell and contains the regulatory elements necessary for the expression of
the human lactoferrin cDNA in this cell.In another embodiment, the present invention provides for
a transformed Aspergillus fungal cell which includes a recombinant plasmid.The plasmid contains a plasmid vector into which a
polydeoxyribonucleotide segment coding for human lactoferrin protein has
been inserted.In yet another embodiment
