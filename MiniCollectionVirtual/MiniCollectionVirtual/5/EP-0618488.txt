<ABSTRACT>
A support for photographic use comprised of at least two 
polyester layers is disclosed, which comprises a first layer 

containing a first polyester and a second layer containing a 
second polyester adjacent to the first layer, the first 

polyester comprising a first monomer unit from a polyalkylene 
glycol and a second monomer unit from an aromatic dicarboxylic 

acid having a metal sulfonate group, wherein the difference 
between the second monomer unit content of the first polyester 

and that of the second polyester, ΔSIP is not more than 5.5 
mol%, the second monomer unit content being expressed based on 

the total content of monomer units from dicarboxylic acids 
contained in the polymer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a support for 
photographic use, and more particularly, to a support for 
photographic use comprised of laminated polyester films 
wherein the curl-recovery property after being subjected to 
photographic processing is excellent, curling property after 
photographic light-sensitive emulsion layers have been formed 
has been improved and adhesive property between each of the 
polyester layers at a extremely low temperature is also 
excellent. Recently, the applications of photographic light-sensitive 
materials have been devirsified. For example, in 
compatibility with miniaturizing of photo taking units, it is 
known that light-sensitive materials with a thinner support 
for photographic use are effective. However, in the case of a 
thinner support for photographic use, so-called stiffness is  
 
weakened. Accordingly, there are problems that transportation 
property and operability in a photo taking unit and developing 
processes become deteriorated. In order to solve the above-mentioned 
problems, it is necessary to enhance mechanical 
strength of a support for photographic use. Especially, the 
value of elastic module is necessary to be enhanced than that 
of the conventional support. Typical plastic film supports currently used are 
triacetyl cellulose (sometimes abbreviated as TAC) and 
polyethylene terephthalate (sometimes abbreviated as PET). A TAC film used for a film in roll mainly has a property 
to have a high transparency without optical aeolotropicity and 
also has an excellent property that curling is recovered after 
being developed. However, since the TAC film has a drawback 
that the mechanical strength is weak in itself, it cannot 
reduce the thickness thereof. On the other hand, a PET film has an excellent mechanical 
strength and size stability. Therefore, it is used in a sheet 
form film such as a film for X-ray film use. However, when 
the PET film is used in a roll film form which is widely used 
as a photographic light-sensitive material, it is difficult to 
recover curling after being developed and it is poor in 
handling property. Accordingly, the range of application is 
limited. As a technology to improve curl recovering property of 
the PET film, a copolymer PET film provided with  
 
hydrophilicity by using an aromatic dicarboxyl acid having a 
metallic sulfonate group as a copolymerization component (see 
Japanese Patent Publication Open to Public Inspection 
(hereinafter referred to as Japanese Patent O.P.I. 
Publication) No. 244446/1989).
