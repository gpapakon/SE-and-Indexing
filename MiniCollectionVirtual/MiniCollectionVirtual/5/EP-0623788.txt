<ABSTRACT>
Illustrated and described is an air cooler for generating a cooling air stream, consisting of a housing 12 which has an air inlet and an air outlet and in which a cooling pipe arrangement 18 carrying a coolant is provided, at least one blower 40 which is driven by an electric motor 38 and is disposed, in the flow direction of the air, downstream of the cooling pipe arrangement 18, as well as an air-guiding grid arrangement 50 provided at the air outlet. The air cooler makes possible the generation of a far-reaching cooling air stream of selectable cross-section form and - in respect of flow rate and outlet direction - homogeneous flow profile in that the blower 40 is disposed in an opening 32 of an intermediate wall 30 which subdivides the housing 12 into an inflow-side heat exchanger chamber containing the cooling pipe arrangement 18 and into an outflow-side pressure chamber 46 with at least one air-guiding grid arrangement 50 disposed at a distance from the blower 40.

Air cooler for producing a cooling air flow, comprising a housing (12)
having an air inlet and an air outlet and in which a cooling pipe arrangement

(18) conducting a cooling medium is provided, at least
one fan (40) driven by an electric motor (38) and arranged in the

flow direction of the air behind the cooling pipe arrangement (18),
and also an air guiding grid arrangement (50, 50') provided at the

air outlet, wherein the fan (40) is arranged in an opening (32) of an
intermediate wall (30), which subdivides the housing (12) into an inflow-side

heat exchanger chamber, containing the cooling pipe arrangement
(18) and an outflow-side pressure chamber (46)

characterised in that

the air inlet includes a plurality of air inlet openings (14) formed in a
base side air inlet wall of the housing (12), in that the intermediate

wall (30) extends substantially parallel to the air inlet wall and has a
substantially constant spacing to the cooling pipe arrangement (18)

over its entire area, and in that the air guiding grid arrangement
(50, 50') has a web mesh structure with a plurality of individual

openings (52).
Air cooler in accordance with claim 1,

characterised in that

the air inlet openings (14) are arranged distributed substantially
over the entire air inlet wall. 
Air cooler in accordance with claim 1 or claim 2,

characterised in that

the air inlet openings (14) form the important part of the area of the
air inlet wall.
Air cooler in accordance with one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that

the height of the webs bounding these individual openings (52)
amounts to approximately 5 to 15 mm.
Air cooler in accordance with one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that

the intermediate wall (10) is arranged in the upper third of the flat
parallelepiped-shaped housing (12).
Air cooler in accordance with one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that

the fan or the fans (40) is or are centrally arranged in the intermediate
wall (30).
Air cooler in accordance with one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that

the housing part lying above the partition wall (30) and forming the
pressure chamber (46) is formed as a separate housing part and is

interchangeably arranged, and can also in particular be equipped
with different air guiding grid arrangements (50, 50').
Air cooler in accordance with one of the preceding claims,
 
characterised in that

the air guiding grid arrangement comprises a single air guiding grid
element (50) provided in the front wall (47) of the housing (12).
Air cooler in accordance with one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that

the air guiding grid element (50, 50') has a rectangular peripheral
shape.
Air cooler in accordance with one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that

an air guiding grid element (50, 50') extends substantially over the
entire width of the front and/or rear wall (47, 48) of the housing

(12).
Air cooler in accordance with one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that

the air guiding grid element (50, 50') only extends over an upper
part region of the height of the pressure chamber (46).
Air cooler in accordance with one of the preceding claims

characterised in that

the total air outlet area of the air guiding grid elements (50, 50') correspond
substantially to the air induction area of the fan (40).
Air cooler in accordance with one of the preceding claims 1 to 11,

characterised in that
 
the total air outlet area of the air guiding grid elements (50, 50') is

smaller than the air induction area of the fan (40) and, in particular,
corresponds 
to half the air induction area of the fan or of the fans
(40).
Air cooler in accordance with one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that

the individual openings (52) are of rectangular shape.
Air cooler in accordance with claim 14,

characterised in that

the individual openings are of square shape.
