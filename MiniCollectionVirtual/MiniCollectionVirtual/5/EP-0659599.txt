<ABSTRACT>
A motor-vehicle air conditioning control unit (1) can be installed in the front of a dashboard (2). In the control unit (1), a measuring air current (L) is to be produced in a simple way, which measuring air current (L) does not stress electronic components (11, 12) and only cools indirectly. For this purpose, an air directing shaft (13) is constructed in the housing (5, 6) of the control unit (1). A heat conducting plate (26) has a heat-conducting connection with at least one electronic component, to be cooled, of a first printed circuit board. The heat conducting plate (26) also bears a second printed circuit board (22).

Regulating unit for a motor vehicle air 
conditioning installation, which can be installed in 

the front of an instrument panel, having a housing 
(5, 6) containing at least two conductor plates 

(10, 22) carrying electronic components, and forming a 
chamber having a front air supply aperture (9) and 

containing a motor-driven impeller (14) which conveys a 
monitored air flow (L) via a sensor (24),
 
characterised in that
 
the above-mentioned chamber of the housing (5, 6) forms 

an air flow compartment (13) which is covered with 
respect to the electronic components (11, 12) of the 

conductor plates (10, 22), and in that for the heat-conductive 
connection of at least one electronic 

component (12) of the first conductor plate (10) to the 
monitored air flow (L), at least one thermal baffle 

plate (26) is provided, which at the same time carries 
the second conductor plate (22). 
Regulating unit according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that
 
the electric motor (15, 16) is secured in a resilient 

manner to the conductor plate (10). 
Regulating unit according to one of the preceding 
claims,
 
characterised in that
 
the electric motor (15, 16) is electronically 

commutated and in that the commutation circuit is 
arranged on the conductor plate (10). 
Regulating unit according to one of the preceding 
claims,
 
characterised in that
  
 

the air flow compartment (13) is partially covered by 
the conductor plate (10) itself with respect to the 

electronic components (11, 12). 
Regulating unit according to one of the preceding 
claims,
 
characterised in that
 
the air flow compartment (13) is completely or 

partially covered by the thermal baffle plate (26) with 
respect to the electronic components (11, 12). 
Regulating unit according to one of the preceding 
claims,
 
characterised in that
 
the impeller (14) is arranged in the air flow 

compartment (13), and its motor (15, 16), separated by 
a dividing wall (30), is arranged outside the air flow 

compartment (13). 
Regulating unit according to one of the preceding 
claims,
 
characterised in that
 
the thermal baffle plate (26) in the air flow 

compartment (13) at the same time forms an air baffle 
plate. 
Regulating unit according to one of the preceding 
claims,
 
characterised in that
 
the second conductor plate (22) is parallel to the 

front side (3) of the housing (5, 6) and has an 
aperture (23) in which the sensor (24) is arranged.
