<ABSTRACT>
A device for automatically milking animals, such as 
cows, comprises a milking parlour (1) and a computer controlled 

milking machine with a milking unit (29) being in a non-operative 
position outside the milking parlour (1). The 

milking unit (29) is provided with horizontally extending 
supporting arms (40, 41) carrying teat cups (52), the supporting 

arms (40, 41) being able to move in an operative position 
under an animal in the milking parlour. The teat cups (52) 

can be arranged in a configuration adaptable to the udder of 
the animal in the milking parlour (1), while the teat cups 

(52) remain connected to the supporting arms (40, 41) during 
the milking operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for automatically 
milking animals, such as cows, comprising a milking parlour 
and a computer-controlled milking machine with a milking unit 
being in a non-operative position outside the milking parlour, 
which milking unit is provided with substantially 
horizontally extending supporting arms carrying teat cups, 
the supporting arms being able to move in an operative 
position under an animal present in the milking parlour. Such a device is known from EP-A-0 091 892. For the 
purpose of discharging the teats of an animal to some extent 
during milking, the device is characterized in that the teat 
cups can be arranged in a configuration adaptable to the 
udder of the animal in the milking parlour and in that the 
teat cups remain connected to the supporting arms during the 
milking operation. Further, according to the invention, the teat cups 
may be hingeably connected to a supporting arm and the 
adjustment of the teat cups relative to the udder of an 
animal in the milking parlour may be performed by computer 
controlled electric motors. 
Further, according to the invention, the device may 
comprise animal identification means, while, based on data in 
the computer about an identified animal in the milking 
parlour, the computer may control the adjustment of the teat 
cups. 
In a specific embodiment the milking unit may be 
provided with a spindle for height adjustment of the teat 
cups.  According to another aspect of the invention, each 
of at least two teat cups may be provided with a carrying arm 
which is hingeably connected to the supporting arm. Thereby, 
the teat cups may be attached to their respective carrying 
arms; these carrying arms may be made of a strip-like material 
and provided with a hinge pin, which may be connected with 
a computer-controlled electric motor. The computer-controlled 
electric motor may be situated between a teat cup and a 
central part of the supporting arm. For a better understanding of the invention an 
embodiment of the device for milking animals will now be 
described with reference to the accompanying drawing. 
Figure 1 is a schematic cross-sectional view of a 
device for milking animals; Figure 2 is a schematical view along line II - II 
of Figure 1; Figure 3 is a schematic view of a cleaning and/or 
drying unit for the udder, which can be coupled automatically 
to the udder of the animal; Figure 4 is a schematic view of a milking unit 
which can be coupled automatically to the udder of the 
animal; Figure 5 shows
