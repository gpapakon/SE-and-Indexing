<ABSTRACT>
An electric power system particularly adapted for 
use in powering the electric motor or motors used in the 

drive train of an electric vehicle. The power system 
includes a power cell which is a continuous flow 

concentration cell which utilizes the electrochemical 
reaction between an acid electrolyte (11) and a base 

electrolyte (13) to produce electrical energy. Both the acid 
and base electrolyte utilized in the power cell are kept 

in external reservoirs (10,12). The use of external reservoirs 
for the electrolytes provides for increases in the 

energy of the system which is only limited by 
the size of the reservoirs. Recharging of the system is 

quickly and conveniently accomplished by recharging the 
reservoirs with fresh electrolyte, or by electrically 

recharging the system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to electric 
power generation, in particular for electric vehicles, 
and the rechargeable power systems used to power the 
electric motors present in such vehicles. More 
particularly, the present invention relates to an 
acid-base concentration cell for use in powering an 
external system, such as an electric vehicle, wherein 
the acid and base electrolytes for the cell are stored 
in external tanks and cycled to the cell on demand. The 
present invention also relates to any application in 
which a high energy density, high power density, 
rechargeable or refuelable electric power source is 
required. The foremost consideration in the design of 
electric vehicles is the battery or fuel cell. In order 
for electric vehicles to be of practical use, it is 
essential that batteries or fuel cells having sufficient 
energy density and power density be developed. The 
energy density of a battery determines the range or 
distance a vehicle can be driven between recharging. On 
the other hand, power density determines the power 
available for acceleration and high speed driving. It 
is important that the battery or fuel cell used to power 
the drive train motors in an electric vehicle have both 
high energy density and power density. Electric vehicles are now generally powered by 
lead-acid batteries. Such batteries are heavy and have 
a relatively limited cycle life when used at the high 
depth of discharge required for providing the most range 
for electric vehicles. Even at high depth of discharge,  
 
the low energy density of lead-acid batteries provides 
a range of only about 50 miles for a small van. In 
addition, recharging of lead-acid batteries is a 
relatively slow process requiring a battery charger 
which must be connected to a source of electricity. 
Other potential power sources have been suggested, such 
as sodium-sulfur batteries. However, the materials used 
in such batteries present problems of their own and 
sodium-sulfur batteries must be operated at high 
temperatures. It would be desirable to provide a battery or fuel 
cell which can be either conventionally recharged, or 
refueled quickly without relying on conventional battery 
recharging systems. Also, it would be desirable to 
refuel using inexpensive, commonplace, non-fossil, non-polluting, 
non-explosive, non-flammable, chemically 
stable liquids. Further, it would be desirable to 
provide a power system wherein both the energy density 
and power density are high enough to power the drive 
trai
