<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an air-conditioning
apparatus for the electric vehicle having a
compressor driven by the electric power supplied from a
battery.In an air-conditioning apparatus for the
electric vehicle, the device for driving an
electrically-operated compressor for air-conditioning
purposes supplies a large switched current to the electrically-operated
compressor. Therefore, the large electric
noise interferes with the car radio, and the large
current fluctuations adversely affects the durability of
the battery for supplying the current. As a result, it
is necessary, as shown in the current waveform diagrams
of Fig. 5(a) and (b), to smooth the current supplied to
the electrically-driven compressor thereby to suppress
the electric noise and current fluctuations. For this
purpose, a capacitor of large electrostatic capacity is
provided at a point where the electrically-operated
compressor driving means is supplied with electric power
through a switching device from the battery.The provision of a capacitor with a large
electrostatic capacity, however, causes a large charge 
current to flow to the capacitor on the instant the
battery is connected. The resulting problem is that the
fuse blows out or the pattern wiring of the printed
board is broken, or a surge current is generated by the
resonance with the inductance component of the wiring
from the battery as shown by the waveform diagram of
Fig. 5(c), thereby damaging the electrically-operated
compressor driving means.In order to suppress the charging surge
current to the capacitor on the instant the battery is
connected, the capacitor is charged through a conducting
device. Normally, a resistor is used as the conducting
device.The operation of a conventional air-conditioning
apparatus for the electric vehicle will be
explained with reference to the circuit diagram of Fig.
7 showing a conventional air-conditioning apparatus for
the electric vehicle and the circuit operation diagram
for the air-conditioning apparatus for the electric
vehicle shown in Fig. 8. With the battery 2 connected,
the voltage Vc of the capacitor 11, the current Ir of
the resistor 8 and the current Ic of the capacitor 11
are determined as shown in Fig. 8 from the time constant
based on the resistance value of the resistor 8 and the
electrostatic capacity of the capacitor 11. When the
capacitor 11 is charged and input voltage detector means
7 detects a voltage of more than a predetermined value,
a controller 6 closes the switching device 3, and power 
is supplied
