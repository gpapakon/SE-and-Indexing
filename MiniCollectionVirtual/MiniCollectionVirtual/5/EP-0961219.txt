<ABSTRACT>
It is provided an apparatus which can perform a data processing
for IC cards which are drawn one by one from a stack or

which are inserted from the exterior of the apparatus, comprising
at least connector means (22) for connecting an IC

card for performing a data processing for the IC card, contacting
means (6, 7) for bringing an IC card to be connected

to the connector means in contact with the same and, discharging
means (6, 7) for discharging an IC card for which

data processing has been performed through a connector means
to the outside of the apparatus.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus for processing IC cards which
embed a thin integrated circuit chip, i.e. an IC chip, according to
the preamble of claim 1.Especially this invention relates to an apparatus for processing IC
cards which are used for fee payment in game arcades, etc., for fare
payment of electric trains, or for automatic vending machines of
goods, and the like. In other words, this invention relates to an
apparatus for processing and issuing or re-issuing IC cards, which
is suitably installed in the machine for selling the IC cards automatically.Until now, various apparatuses for selling cards have been
developed. For example, the applicant's Japanese utility model application
63-60147 discloses a card-sending-out apparatus suitable
for a card vending machine. This application is published as Japanese
utility model publication 7-26276, and it is further registered
as the United States patent 4,993,587.The card-sending-out apparatus has an accommodation chamber 50 for
accommodating a multilayer stack 3 of cards, as shown in Fig. 17.
The sending-out apparatus is provided with a supporting plate 4.
This supports the multilayer body 3 of cards from below. The sending-out
apparatus is provided with a drawing roller 5 for cards below
the supporting plate 4. The card-sending-out rollers 7 and 9 are
provided between the drawing roller 5 and a card-sending-out opening
40.A card, which is drawn out from below the card multilayer stack 3 by
the drawing roller 5, is sent to the exit 40 with the sending-out
rollers 7 and 9. The apparatus further has a roller 8, which is provided
above the sending-out roller 7, and the roller 8 rotates in
the reverse direction against the card-sending-out direction and 
prevents that two cards are sent out. The gap between rollers 7
and 8 is defined for passing only one card which was drawn out
by the drawing roller 5. When a card is blocked between rollers
7 and 8, the card is detected by a sensor (not shown ) and a
reverse rotation of drawing roller 5 is performed. If the drawing
roller 5 is rotated in the reverse direction, the roller 8
for preventing the sending-out of two cards, which is interlocked
with the roller 5, is also rotated in the reverse direction.
However, since the mechanism of roller 8 is provided with
a clutch structure, the start of the reverse rotation of the
roller 8 is delayed for a while from the start of the reverse
rotation of drawing roller 5. Therefore, the card, which is
blocked between roller 7 and 8, is returned in the reverse
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for processing IC cards, comprising at least

opening means (23) for receiving or discharging an IC
card (32);
connector means (22) for connecting the IC card to
perform a data processing for the IC card; and
transfer means (6, 7) which is provided between the
opening means and connector means,

and which comprises

at least a roller (6) and an idler (7) which is pressed
against said roller for transferring said IC card (32)

from said opening means to said connector means and
from said connector means to said opening means,

characterized in that

the shaft of said idler (7) is rotatable around the rotation axis of
the roller for transferring said IC card to a

collecting position.
The apparatus according to claim 1, further comprising

drawing means (1, 4, 5) for drawing an IC card
positioned at a specific position of a stack (28) of IC

cards away from the stack.
The apparatus according to claim 2, characterized in that
the specific position of the stack (28) is the position

at the bottom or the exterior.
The apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 3,
characterized by 


shutter means (53, SH, SL2) for opening and closing
said opening means (23) to the outside of the

apparatus.
The apparatus according to claim 4, characterized in that
said shutter means (53, SH, SL2, CS, BZ) is adapted for

detecting an IC card (32) inserted from the outside of
the apparatus and for accepting the IC card for insertion

into the inside thereof.
The apparatus according to claim 4 or 5, characterized in
that

said shutter means (53, SH, SL2, CP, BZ) is adapted for
detecting an IC card (32) moved by the transfer means to

the opening means for discharge and for opening the
opening means (23) for a passage of the IC card.
The apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 6, wherein
the transfer means comprises


collecting means (6, 7, 20, 39) for collecting an IC
card (32D) which could not be processed at the

collecting position in the inside of the apparatus.
