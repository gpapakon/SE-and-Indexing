<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to phase shifting in an 
internal combustion engine between the camshaft and 
crankshaft. More particularly, this invention relates to 
precise modular control of the timing of engine valves for 
various engine throttle speeds through the use of a 
rotational hydraulic coupling between the camshaft driving 
sprocket and the camshaft. Traditionally, the timing between the camshaft and 
crankshaft are fixed for some predetermined optimum engine 
speed, but the timing will then be less than optimum at 
other engine speeds. Varying the timing between the 
camshaft and crankshaft by accurately modulating the phase 
shift, to ensure that it is optimised during engine 
operation, produces several benefits. It is common 
knowledge that adequate phase shifting will improve idle 
stability, the broadness of the torque curve and the RPM 
(revolutions per minutes) range of the engine. Additional 
benefits to be expected are (i) full control of emission 
gases and elimination of undesirable emissions [NOx], (ii) 
part load fuel efficiency improvements and (iii) elimination 
of external exhaust gas recirculation components and 
circuitry [EGR]. In developing a device to obtain these benefits, 
several important considerations are taken into account. 
The control system of the device should require low power 
consumption. Further, the response of the system must be 
fast and accurate to maximise these benefits. Also, a 
system must be capable of being modulated incrementally 
throughout an entire range, as opposed to two position 
phase shifting, i.e., full advance or full retard only, to 
improve the overall effectiveness of the device. Prior art, such as U.S. Patent Nos. 3,685,499 and 
3,721,220, have incorporated hydraulic means to accomplish 
phase shifts between the camshaft and crankshaft to 
achieve some of these benefits.  
 In U.S. Patent No. 3,685,499 to Meacham et al. the phase 
shifting device is a helical ball spline mechanism. A driven 
member is fixed to the camshaft and connected by a helical 
ball spline to a piston which is rotatably fixed relative to 
the crankshaft. The inner and outer races of the ball spline 
form an enclosed cavity for hydraulic fluid. This is not a 
closed system since the flow of fluid into or out of the 
cavity, to obtain the phase shift, comes from outside the 
system, i.e. the primary engine oil source, and is 
continuous throughout the phase shift. Further, it requires 
the engine oil pressure as the source of energy for 
effecting the phase shift.
