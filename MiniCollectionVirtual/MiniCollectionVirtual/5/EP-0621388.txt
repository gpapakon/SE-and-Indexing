Door comprising: 

a rectangular frontage (2) forming a frame, 
extending over the entire surface of the door and carrying 

pivoting means (62) intended for cooperating with 
corresponding pivoting means (64) carried by a casing 

(63), so as to ensure the pivoting of the door relative 
to the latter along a rear longitudinal edge (12) of the 

door; and 
a lock (10) arranged in the vicinity of a front 
longitudinal edge (11) of the frontage (2) and comprising 

at least one movable bolt (44), intended for cooperating 
with an orifice made in the casing (63), and operating 

means for displacing this bolt, 
the frontage carrying a front sill (18, 22) 
attached to the latter and extending over the entire 

thickness of the door, the said attached sill (18, 22) 
defining a longitudinal receptacle arranged so as to be 

set back relative to the said front edge (11) of the 
frontage and capable of receiving the said lock, 
 
characterized in that the said attached sill comprises 

four successive portions (17, 18, 23, 24) which are 
perpendicular to one another and of which a first (17) is 

fastened against an inner face of the frontage (2), a 
second (18) and a third (23) define the said longitudinal 

receptacle and a fourth is aligned with the said front 
prolongation (11) of the frontage. 
Door according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the said attached sill carries a prolongation (25) on a 

side furthest away from the frontage (2), the said 
prolongation extending parallel to the latter in a  

 
direction opposite to tne said pivoting means (62), so as 

to cover the said casing (63). 
Door according to one of Claims 1 and 2, characterized 
in that the said lock (10) is of the bar-lock 

type comprising a fore-end (40) extending over most of 
the length of the door and supporting a plurality of 

movable bolts (42 to 45) distributed over the length of 
the said fore-end and passing through it. 
Door according to any one of the preceding 
claims, in which the frontage (2) has a perpendicular 

rear longitudinal sill (12) extending over the entire 
thickness of the door and carrying a perpendicular 

prolongation (15) designed to cover the said casing (63), 
the said pivoting means (62) being arranged so as to face 

a free longitudinal edge of the said prolongation (15). 
Door according to Claim 3 or Claim 4, in which 
the said prolongation (25; 15) carries a turned-down 

piece (26; 16) extending along the latter until the said 
piece caps a panel (72) extending ower an entire inner 

face of the door. 
Door according to any one of the preceding 
claims, in which the frontage (2) carries a lower sill 

(30) attached to the latter and extending over the entire 
thickness of the door, the said lower sill comprising a 

first portion (31) perpendicular to the frontage (2) and 
three other portions (32 to 34) defining a longitudinal 

receptacle of U-shaped cross-section, arranged so as to 
be set back relative to a lower edge of the frontage and 

against an inner face of the door and being capable of 
receiving seal-forming means (74) for cooperating with 

the casing (63), the attached sill also comprising a 
fifth portion (35) forming a turned-down piece, extending 

along the fourth portion (34) until the said fifth 
portion covers a panel (72) extending over an entire 

inner face of the door.
