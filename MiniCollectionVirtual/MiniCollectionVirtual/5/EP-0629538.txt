<ABSTRACT>
The present invention proposes a trolley supporting trays 
to be used preferably for oven products to be processed. 

The present trolley is carried out with a new constructive 
assembling method according to which just a few modular elements 

are to be realized and developed, the construction and mounting 
of such modular elements being easy. 
In general, a trolley (1) according to the present invention 
consists of modular components which are horizontal longitudinal 

members (2), die-cast angular unions (3), spacers (4) and 
structurals (5) that support the trays. On the whole, 

such elements form a parallelepiped-shaped frame which is 
locked by locking vertical tubes (6) showing a square or 

round section, the dimensions of such tubes being smaller 
than those of the spacers (4). 
The vertical construction of the trolley is carried out by 
alternating spacers (4) and structurals (5), the structurals 

being inserted in the vertical tubes (6). 
The construction is locked by means of a locking joint (11) 
which is inserted in the ends of the tubes (6).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present patent for invention refers to a trolley for 
supporting trays for oven products or the like, such trolley 
being carried out with a sectional modular structure. As it is known, the production of oven goods or the like, for 
instance in the field of bread-making or in the field of 
the confectionery, provides that the product has to be mixed, 
shaped and positioned on collecting trays or plates. Then, 
such trays or plates are inserted in movable trolleys which 
carry the product to be processed for instance to the leavening 
and baking sector. At present, the trolleys that support and carry the above-described 
trays are carried out by forming a supporting 
structure or frame which consist of metallic structurals 
of different lengths. The structurals are usually assembled 
by soldering them so as to form an essentially prismatic 
four-side frame onto which hangers are in turn soldered to 
support the trays. As it can be seen, the realization of the known trolleys, 
as it is carried out at present, involves too much work,  
 
above all when considering the large number of components 
to be used. In fact, the assembling procedure is too long 
and as as consequence of this, the production and sale cost 
becomes high. The object of the present invention is the elimination or 
at least the reduction of the above-described inconveniences 
which are caused by the complexity in the production and 
construction of the trolleys that support the plates or the 
like for the oven products, and in particular the use of 
a new constructive method that provides just a few modular 
elements to be carried out and developed, such modular 
elements being simple as concerns their construction and 
assembling and permitting to obtain frames of any size depending 
on the number of the modular components used and there is 
no more the necessity of realizing more assemblies and elements 
with single function to be produced separately and assembled 
and soldered to each other in several subsequent phases. In the range of the aforesaid general object, the present 
invention proposes also that the trolleys in question may 
be assembled by connecting limited types of modular 
components and the phases for the realization of the components 
have been facilitated in order to make the work in the 
workshop of production easier.  Furthermore, the modular components according to the present 
invention may be produced in a large quantity and stored 
in a restricted space since there is a limited number of 
types of such

<CLAIMS>
Modular structure trolley supporting trays or the like 
for oven products or the like, characterized in particular 

by the fact that it consists of an assembly of horizontal 
longitudinal members (2), die-cast angular unions (3), spacers 

(4) and structurals (5) supporting the trays, a 
parallelepiped-shaped frame being formed by such components 

and being locked by locking vertical tubes (6); the supporting 
structurals (5) form more overlapped, symmetrical levels 

in respect of both opposite sides of the frame and are provided 
with holes (18) so that the structurals (5) may be inserted 

in the tubes (6) between the spacers (4). 
Modular structure trolley as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterized by the fact that the assembling of the trolley 

provides the formation of a base by connecting four angular 
unions (3) with four horizontal longitudinal members (2), 

the insertion of four locking tubes (6), equipped with locking 
joints (11), in the angulars (3) and the subsequent insertion 

of an alternate series of spacers (4) and supporting 
structurals (5) in the tubes (6). 
Modular structure trolley as claimed in the foregoing 
claims, characterized by the fact that the vertical locking 

tubes (6) are arranged between two angular unions (3), opposite 
vertically, of each edge of the frame and are locked by 

screws (10) or the like which are inserted in locking joints 
(11) with which the tubes are provided. 
Modular structure trolley as claimed in the foregoing 
claims, characterized by the fact that the horizontal 

longitudinal members (2) are inserted on appendixes (7) 
of the angular unions (3), such appendixes being arranged 

horizontally and orthogonally to each other. 
Modular structure trolley as claimed in the foregoing 
claims, characterized by the fact that each angular union 

(3) is also provided with a seat (8) in which a vertical 
locking tube (6) may be housed. 
Modular structure trolley as claimed in the foregoing 
claims, characterized by the fact that each structural (5) 

is provided with an outer horizontal plane (15) which is 
connected through a connecting vertical surface (16) with 

a second horizontal plane (17) which is lower than the former 
and is turned towards the inner part of the trolley so as 

to form the support for the tray. 
Modular structure trolley as claimed in the foregoing 
 

claims, characterized by the fact that the outer horizontal 
plane (15) of each supporting structural (5) is provided 

with two holes (18) in which the vertical locking tubes (6) 
may be inserted.
