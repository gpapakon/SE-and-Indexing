<ABSTRACT>
Described is a thermoplastic elastomer comprising 
(A) 10-90 wt.% of polypropylene having substantially a 

syndiotactic structure, and (B) 90-10 wt.% of an 
ethylene-propylene-nonconjugated diene copolymer rubber 

and/or ethylene-propylene copolymer rubber, said (B) 
having been partially crosslinked. The elastomer according 

to the present invention is useful for obtaining 
formed products, particularly automotive bumper 

fascias, automotive mud guards and automotive trim skin 
material, which are excellent not only in flexibility, 

rubber elasticity and mechanical strength but also in 
external appearance and touch, and are substantially 

free from bleeding and fogging.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a thermoplastic
elastomer useful for obtaining a molded or otherwise
formed product which is excellent in not only
flexibility, rubber elasticity and mechanical strength
but also in external appearance and touch and is substantially
free from bleeding and fogging; and a production
process of the thermoplastic elastomer; such a
molded or otherwise formed product; and a composition
for the thermoplastic elastomer (hereinafter called
thermoplastic elastomer composition).It is known for many years that a syndiotactic
polypropylene can be obtained by conducting polymerization
at a low temperature in the presence a catalyst
composed of a vanadium compound, an ether and an
organoaluminum. The polymer available by this process
however has low syndiotacticity so that it can hardly
be considered to literally have syndiotactic 
properties. J.A. Ewen et al. found for the first time
that polypropylene having such high tacticity as exceeding
0.7 in terms of syndiotactic pentad fraction
can be obtained using a catalyst composed of
aluminoxane and a transition metal compound having an
asymmetric ligand (J. Amer. Chem. Soc., 110, 6255-6,
1988).The polymer obtained according to the process of
J.A. Ewen et al. had high syndiotacticity and was
equipped with more elastic properties than isotactic
polypropylene. Its flexibility, rubber elasticity and
mechanical strength, however, were not sufficient when
one tried to apply it as a soft molding or forming
material to fields where soft PVC, vulcanized rubber or
the like was employed.It has been attempted to improve the flexibility
and impact resistance of isotactic polypropylene,
usually by blending an ethylene-propylene copolymer
rubber or the like. The resin compositions thus obtained
were excellent in flexibility and impact
resistance, but insufficient in rubber elasticity, mechanical
strength and external appearance.With a view toward overcoming the above problems,
some processes have been proposed, including a process
in which a thermoplastic resin composition is dynamically 
cally crosslinked with an organic peroxide [as disclosed
in Japanese Patent Publication No. 34210/1978
(corresponding to U.S. Patent No. 3806558)] and a process
in which a thermoplastic resin containing a polymer
having unsaturated carbon-carbon bonds such as rubber
is dynamically crosslinked with a sulfur-base
crosslinking agent [as disclosed in Japanese Patent
Publication No. 18448/1970 (corresponding to U.S.
Patent No. 4130535)].These processes are however accompanied by
