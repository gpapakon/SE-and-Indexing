Device for the purpose of monitoring the surfaces of test samples for measuring 
deformation according to the Speckle-Shearing-method in a compact construction, 

comprising a coherent illumination of the surface of the test sample, an image 
sensor (7) and a two-beam interferometer which is used for the purpose of imaging 

the surface of the test sample on to the image sensor, and comprises two mirrors 
(6, 8) and a beam splitter (3) and wherein adjusting devices (13, 14) are provided 

for the purpose of adjusting at least one of the mirrors (6, 8) in a longitudinal and 
transverse manner, characterised in that the two-beam interferometer is formed as 

a Michelson-interferometer and in the Michelson-interferometer arrangement 
concave mirrors (6, 8) of preferably the same focal length are formed as an end 

mirror and as imaging optics for the purpose of imaging the surface of the test 
sample on to the image sensor. 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the beam splitter (3) is a beam 
splitter cube which splits the light which is incident from the surface of the test 

sample (1) into a first interferometer arm (4) which extends in a transverse manner 
with respect to the direction of incidence and into a second interferometer arm (5) 

which extends in the direction of incidence. 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that a piezo-translator (12) is 
provided in conjunction with one of the two concave mirrors (6 or 8) in order to move 

said concave mirror in a controlled manner along the main axis of its interferometer 
arm. 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that adjusting screws (13) are 
provided as adjusting devices in order to adjust the concave mirrors (6 or 8) by 

displacing in a transverse manner or tilting with respect to the axis of the respective 
interferometer arm (4 or 5).  

 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that adjusting screws (14) are 
provided as adjusting devices in order to adjust the concave mirrors (6 or 8) along 

the respective interferometer arm (4 or 5). 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the focal length of the concave 
mirrors (6, 8) is selected in such a manner that they can be arranged directly behind 

the beam splitter (3). 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the optical imaging system of 
the concave mirrors (6, 8) is supplemented by an objective (2) which is disposed 

between the surface (1) and the beam splitter (3). 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that a combination of a plane or 
convex mirror comprising a convergent lens arrangement is provided instead of one 

or both concave mirrors (6, 8).
