<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel microorganism
capable of producing high molecular weight hyaluronic acid,
a process for preparing said hyaluronic acid by employing the
microorganism and a medium suitable for culturing the
microorganism so as to produce said hyaluronic acid.As well known in the art, hyaluronic acid is a colorless,
transparent and highly viscous linear polysaccharide having a
molecular weight ranging from 50 kda to 13,000 kda with an
unbranched chain of alternating β-(1,4)-glucuronic acid and β-(1,3)-N-acetyl
glucosamine linkages. Hyaluronic acid and its
salts have found numerous usages, e.g., as a vitreous
replacement in optical surgery and eye drop formula, and as a
moisturizer in cosmetic formulations. Generally, hyaluronic
acid is prepared by extracting it from animal tissues or
culturing certain microorganisms.For example, U. S. Patent No. 4,141,973 (Balaz) describes
processes for extracting hyaluronic acid from animal tissues,
by way of purifying or removing biopolymer impurities such as
chondroitin sulfate and glycosaminoglycan in tissues; and they
are not generally regarded as suitable for the mass production 
thereof due to high cost and low efficiency.Accordingly, there have been proposed various processes
for producing hyaluronic acid by using microorganisms,
especially those microorganisms belonging to the genus
Streptococcus. The exemplary microorganisms which have been
used in producing hyaluronic acid include S.pyogenes, S.
faecalis,S.dysgalactiae, S.zooepidemicus, S. equi, S.
equisimilis, etc.; and they are classified as Lansfield serum
group A or C in Bergey's Manual. They are also reported as
hemolytic chain-formed cocci having β hemolytic action. The
processes for producing hyaluronic acid by using a
microorganism belonging to the genus Streptococcus are
disclosed in, e.g., Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication Nos.
56692/1983 and 500997/1985, Korean Patent Publication No. 92-9494
and Korean Patent Laid-open Publication No. 87-11252.In addition, various processes for improving the
productivity of hyaluronic acid by employing the
microorganisms of Streptococcus have been developed: for
example, a process for increasing the productivity of
hyaluronic acid by regulating the concentration of phosphate
(Korean Patent Publication No. 90-5774); a process using
pyruvate, glucosamine, etc.(Japanese Patent Laid-open
Publication No. 257901/1987); a process using an aromatic
compound containing one or more hydroxy radicals(Japanese
Patent Laid-open Publication No.
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A mutant strain of Streptococcus zooepidemicus which
produces hyaluronic acid 
having an average molecular weight
of 3500 kda or higher
, 
obtainable
 by a process which
comprises:


mutagenizing Streptococcus zooepidemicus (ATCC 35246)
with N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine at least three times

to thereby produce mutant strains; and
selecting therefrom a strain that lacks hemolytic activity and
hyaluronidase activity.
The mutant strain 
of claim 1
, which is Streptococcus
zooepidemicus LBF707 (KCTC 0075BP).
A process for producing hyaluronic acid, which comprises
culturing the mutant strain 
of claim 1.
A process for producing hyaluronic acid having a high
molecular weight in a high yield which comprises culturing a

microorganism belonging to the genus 
Streptococcus
 in a
medium, wherein uridine is added to the medium.
The process of claim 4, wherein said microorganism is

Streptococcus
zooepidemicus
 LBF707(KCTC 00758P).
The process of claim 4 or 5, wherein the concentration
of uridine is 0.1 to 5.0 g/ℓ.
