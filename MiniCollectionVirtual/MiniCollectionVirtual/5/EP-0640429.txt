<ABSTRACT>
A pneumatic actuator system is used to move a welding electrode (E) to and from the working position relative to a surface (a). The electrode is mounted at the end of a piston assembly that has a stem (6') connecting with a pair of sealed pistons (6,7). Inlet compressed air is applied to move the assembly down using pressure on both pistons via a centre bore (8). Motion is controlled by venting through a small bore line (15). The motion is reversed by applying compressed air to the lower inlet (10) and a sealing sleeve (11) is axially displaced to provide rapid venting of the upper chamber.

<CLAIMS>
A pneumatic drive, in particular, for the operation of welding electrodes, comprising a 
cylinder (1) including valve-controlled connections for the supply and discharge of 

operating fluid, the interior of which cylinder divided by a partition (2) into two pressure 
chambers (3,4) accommodates two separately arranged pistons (6,7) seated on a 

common piston rod (6') provided on the free end thereof with a work accommodating 
unit (5), with the two pressure chambers (3,4) being interconnected for the advance 

movement through a passageway (8) in the piston rod (6'), and a valve-controlled 
conduit guide provided with a constrictor (9) and leading to the high-speed ventilating 

and return stroke connection (10) arranged on the partition (2) being provided in the 
area of the partition (2), characterized in that sealingly arranged on the side of the first 

pressure chamber (3), within the partition (2), is a limitedly displaceable valve sleeve (11) 
sealingly enclosing the piston rod (6') and provided with a sealing flange (14) movable 

between two stops (12,13) on the partition (2), and that arranged within the sleeve 
((11) is a constricting conduit (15) between the first pressure chamber (3) and an 

overflow chamber (16) confined by a cylindrical part (11') of the sleeve (11) and the 
partition (2), so as to terminate underneath the sealing flange (14) in which the high-speed 

ventilating and return stroke connection (10) terminates below the sealing flange 
(14). 
A drive according to claim 1, characterized in that the stop (12) on the side of the 
pressure chamber (3) is in the form of a snap ring (12') inserted in the partition (2). 
A drive according to claims 1 or 2,
 
characterized in that the valve sleeve (11) down to the sealing flange (14) is of a 

cylindrical configuration, and that a sealant (17) sealing against the piston rod (6') and a  
 

sealant (18) sealing against the partition (2) are arranged at the bottom end of the 
cylindrical part (11'). 
A drive according to any one of claims 1 to 3,
 
characterized in that an O-ring gasket (14') is arranged in the sealing flange (14) for 

sealing against the side of the stop (13). 
A drive according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that an annular recess 
(19) is provided in the valve sleeve (11) on the side of the pressure chamber (3), from 

where the constricting conduit (15) in the form of an angle bore is guided to the 
overflow chamber (16).
