<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magnetic recording
medium according to the preamble of claim 1. The magnetic recording medium comprises, as a magnetic recording layer, a ferromagnetic
metal thin film which is suitable for high density magnetic recording
and, in particular, suitable for use in a digital video tape recorder or
a high definition video tape recorder.In these years, as read/write equipment is miniaturized
and made high quality in the magnetic recording field, magnetic recording
media which enables high density recording have been vigorously
developed. Recently, a continuous thin film type magnetic recording
medium which is quite advantageous in short wavelength recording
has been practically used in place of a particulate magnetic recording
medium comprising a magnetic layer in which magnetic powder
is dispersed in a binder resin.With each of the above type magnetic recording media, in
the writing and reading processes, the magnetic recording medium
and a magnetic head are contacted and slid. That is, a video tape or a
floppy disc is continuously contacted to and slid over the magnetic
head, while a magnetic disc is discontinuously contacted to and slid
over the magnetic head. However, since the magnetic layer surface of
the continuous thin film type magnetic recording medium is very
smooth and has low hardness so that it is easily plastically deformed,
the coefficient of friction of the magnetic layer against the 
magnetic head tends to increase. As a result, the magnetic layer
tends to be abraded or damaged in the writing and reading processes.Further, in a high humidity atmosphere, the magnetic
layer surface is oxidized and corroded, so that the magnetic characteristics
of the magnetic recording medium are deteriorated.Therefore, the conventional thin film type magnetic recording
medium has a protective film and a lubricant layer on the surface
of magnetic layer to increase the running durability, namely to
prevent the damage of the medium due to contact sliding of the
medium over the magnetic head, and to improved corrosion resistance,
namely to suppress the corrosion of the magnetic thin layer in
the high humidity atmosphere.Currently, as a non-magnetic substrate, a polyester film
or a nickel-phosphorus plated aluminum disc is used. In some cases,
the non-magnetic substrate has an undercoating layer with a filler or
a texture consisting of a multiplicity of circumferential stripes to
control surface roughness of the medium, if desired.The magnetic layer consisting of the
