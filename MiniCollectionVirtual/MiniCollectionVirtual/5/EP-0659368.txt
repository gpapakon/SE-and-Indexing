<ABSTRACT>
A chair base (10) adapted to support a column (12) 
and a chair seat (14) includes a hub (20) having a central 

axis and a plurality of legs (22) attached to and radially 
extending from the hub. A bore (36) extends concentrically 

along the axis through the hub defining an interior wall 
(34) within the hub. The interior wall includes an upper 

conical wall portion (46) extending between a circular first 
upper edge (48) and a circular first lower edge (50). The 

first upper edge has a larger diameter than the first lower 
edge such that the conical wall portion tapers inwardly and 

downwardly. The interior wall also includes a lower wall 
portion (54) disposed below the upper conical wall portion 

which extends between a circular second upper edge (56) and 
a circular second lower edge (58). The second upper edge of 

the lower wall portion has a diameter which is smaller than 
the diameter of the first lower edge of the upper conical 

wall portion. A generally annular wall portion (62) extends 
between the second upper edge (56) of the lower wall portion 

and the first lower edge (50) of the conical wall portion. 
The annular wall forms an inwardly extending step for 

engaging the bottom end (16) of the column (12) when the 
column is inserted into the bore and thereby prevents the 

column from moving downwardly through the bore past a 
predetermined point during use.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a chair base adapted to support a column for 
supporting a chair seat and, in particular, to a chair base having a stepped hub to prevent 
creep of the column through the chair base. Prior chair bases, of the type illustrated in United States Design Patent Nos. Des. 
312,011 and Des. 321,299 or in EP-A-0 331 104, have included 
a central hub from which a plurality of legs 
radially extend. The hubs in these prior chair bases generally include a bore extending 
vertically therethrough which forms a single conical wall portion within the hub. The conical 
wall portion of the hub is made entirely of plastic or includes a conical metal insert positioned 
within the bore of the hub. The bottom end of the column which is inserted into the bore of 
the chair base generally also includes a tapered conical wall adapted to engage the conical 
wall of the hub. As the tapered wall of the column is inserted into the bore of the hub the 
tapered wall of the column becomes wedged into engagement with the conical wall portion 
of the hub. This wedging effect of the column into the hub attaches the column to the chair 
base such that the top end of the column does not wiggle or deflect laterally. Over time, as loads are repeatedly applied to the chair column, the bottom end of the 
column used with prior chair bases has been found to creep downwardly through the bore in 
the hub of the chair base from its originally installed position. As the column creeps 
downwardly, the conical wall of the column exerts increasingly greater forces on the hub and 
causes the formation of stress fractures in the hub wall thereby making the chair unsafe for 
further use as eventually a complete fracture of the hub will take place whereupon the column 
and attached chair may topple over. In those instances where the hub may not completely  
 
fracture, its internal diameter will continue to expand and the column will continue to creep 
downwardly until the bottom end of the column passes through the hub and hits the floor and 
thereafter drags therealong when the chair is moved horizontally. Even the use of steel 
sleeves as inserts within the bore of the hub has not been able to prevent the unwanted 
downward creep of the column through the hubs of prior chair bases. The downward creep of the column through the hub of a chair base not only causes 
potential safety hazards due to the resulting stress fracturing of the hub and the potential 
sudden total fracturing of the hub, but also severely

<CLAIMS>
A chair base adapted to support a column for a seat 
comprising a hub (20) having a central axis (38); a 

plurality of legs (22) radially extending from said hub 
(20); a bore (36) extending concentrically along said axis 

(38) through said hub (20) defining an interior wall (34), 
said interior wall including an upper tapered wall portion 

(46) extending between a first upper edge (48) and a first 
lower edge (50), said first upper edge (48) defining a 

larger cross-sectional area than said first lower edge (50) 
such that said tapered wall portion (48) tapers inwardly and 

downwardly; characterised in that said interior wall includes 
a lower wall portion (54) disposed below 

said upper wall portion (46) extending between a second 
upper edge (56) and a second lower edge (58), said second 

upper edge (56) of said lower wall portion (54) defining a 
smaller cross-sectional area than said first lower edge (50) 

of said upper wall portion (46); and a 
peripheral wall portion (62) extending between said second 

upper edge (56) of said lower wall portion (54) and said 
first lower edge (50) of said upper tapered wall portion 

(46) to form an inwardly extending step for engaging and 
supporting a lower end of the column (12) when the column is 

inserted into said bore (36) to limit the 
downward movement of the column (12) within the bore (36) 

and thereby prevent the column from moving past a 
predetermined location. 
The chair base of claim 1 characterised in that said 
first upper edge (48) of said upper wall portion (46) and 

said second upper edge (56) of said lower wall portion (54) 
are generally circular.  

 
The chair base of claim 2 characterised in that said 
upper tapered wall portion (46) is generally conical. 
The chair base of claim 1 characterised in that said 
second upper edge (56) of said lower wall portion (54) is 

generally circular. 
The chair base of claim 1 characterised in that said 
peripheral wall portion (62) comprises a generally planar 

surface. 
The chair base of claim 1 characterised in that said 
second upper edge (56) of said lower wall portion (54) is 

generally located in the same plane as said first lower edge 
(50) of said upper wall portion (46). 
The chair base of claim 1 characterised in that said 
lower wall portion (54) is generally cylindrical.
