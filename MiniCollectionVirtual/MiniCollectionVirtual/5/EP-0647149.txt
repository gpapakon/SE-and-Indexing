<ABSTRACT>
A stimulator for applying stimulus pulses to the AV nodal fat pad in response to sensed atrial rate exceeding a predetermined rate, in order to reduce the ventricular rate. The device also includes a cardiac pacemaker which serves to pace the ventricle in the event that the ventricular rate is lowered below a pacing rate, and provides for feedback control of the stimulus parameters applied to the AV nodal fat pad, as a function of the determined effect of the stimulus pulses on the ventricular rate.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to implantable stimulators 
generally and more particularly to implantable nerve 
stimulators and pacemakers. It is known that stimulation of the vagus nerve is 
effective to reduce the sinus rate, as well as to prolong 
the AV conduction time or, if stimulation energies are high 
enough, to induce A-V block. Use of vagal nerve stimulation 
to treat supraventricular arrhythmias and angina pectoris is 
disclosed in the article "Vagal Tuning" by Bilgutay et al., 
Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, Vol. 56, No. 
1, July, 1968, pp. 71-82. It is also known that stimulation 
of the carotid sinus nerve produces a similar result, as 
disclosed in the article "Carotid Sinus Nerve Stimulation in 
the Treatment of Angina Pectoris and Supraventricular 
Tachycardia" by Braunwald et al., published in California 
Medicine, Vol. 112, pp. 41-50, March, 1970. The nervous system regulating the rhythm of the heart 
also includes a number of highly ganglionated plexi or "fat 
pads" at various locations on the heart, including fat pads 
associated with the SA and AV nodes. The fat pad associated 
with the SA node is located overlying the right pulmonary 
vein entrance in dogs, and is located along the anterior AV 
groove in most humans. The fat pad associated with the AV 
node is located at the junction of the inferior vena cava 
and the inferior left atrium in dogs, and is located along 
the posterior AV groove in most humans. As set forth in "Functional Anatomy of the Cardiac 
Efferent Innervation", by Randall et al, in Neurocardiology, 
edited by Kulbertus et al, Futura Publishing Co., 1988, 
direct surgical excision of the fat pad associated with the 
SA node affects the functioning of the SA node without  
 
significantly affecting the AV node. Similarly, excision of 
the fat pad associated with the AV node affects functioning 
of the AV node without significantly affecting the SA node. As set forth in the article "Parasympathetic 
Postganglionic Pathways to the Sinoatrial Node", Bluemel et 
al, Am. J. Physiol. 259, (Heart Circ. Physiol. 28) H1504-H1510, 
1990, stimulation of the fat pad associated with the 
SA node results in slowing of the sinus rate without the 
accompanying prolongation of A-V conduction time which 
normally results from vagal nerve stimulation. The article 
also indicates that stimulation of the fat pad associated 
with the AV node is believed to produce corresponding 
effects limited to the AV node, i.e. extension of the A-V 
conduction time without concurrent
