<ABSTRACT>
The hydraulic drive control uses an electrically-controlled valve determining the quantity of hydraulic fluid supplied to the hydraulic drive in dependence on an electrical signal supplied by a processor. The processor has a high processing speed for continuous calculation of the required value for the drive movement, for supplying a corresp. electrical signal. Pref. the processor monitors the pressure between the valve and the working space of the drive, or the pressure different between the feed and return lines for the drive.
