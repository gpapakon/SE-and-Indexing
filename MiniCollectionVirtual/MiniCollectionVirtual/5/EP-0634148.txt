<ABSTRACT>
A dental handpiece contains a head part (1) for 
accommodating a dental treatment tool (25), a grip part (2) 

coupled and secured to the head part (1) for supporting the 
head part (1), an engagement holding member (11) rotatably 

mounted within the head part (1) and adapted for engaging with 
and detachably holding a portion (23) of the dental treatment 

tool (25) introduced into the head part (1), a releasing 
member (17) abuttable against the engagement holding member 

(11) for releasing engagement between the dental treatment 
tool (25) and the engagement holding member (11), and a 

mistaken operation prevention cover member (26) detachably 
sheathing the releasing member (17) for preventing mistaken 

operation of the releasing member (17).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a dental handpiece having
the function of preventing its mistaken releasing operation.Up to now, there has been extensively employed for
dental treatment a dental handpiece having a bur, the upper
part of which has a cut-out portion or a friction gripping
portion to be adapted for receiving the bur by a lower split
portion defining a groove. Such dental handpiece has driving
means, such as an impeller or a motor driven by pneumatic
pressure or electric power, water supplying means and air
supplying/discharging means.The above-mentioned driving means are designed to
run a bur having a grinding distal end in rotation. For
dental therapy, such a bur is selected so as to have a
grinding end having the shape or size suited to the position
or shape of the site being treated or to the purpose of the
treatment, and is exchangeably attached to a tool head.Such bur is attached to the tool head with the aid
of a wrench or by thrusting a bur releasing member in the form
of a pushbutton.In the latter type handpiece in which a pushbutton
is thrust for attaching the bur, the pushbutton is usually
thrust against the force of a spring normally urging the 
pushbotton in the returning direction, and an elastic ring member (spring) on a
rotary shaft, termed a bur tube for supporting the bur, is pushed for opening the
bur resiliently supported on the elastic ring member.With such conventional dental handpiece, if the pushbotton is thrust not so
strongly that the bur becomes detached from the elastic ring member, that is if
the pushbotton is mistakenly thrust with a medium force during treatment of the
molar tooth, above all, during grinding of narrow sites or formation of artificial
crowns, the pushbutton is brought into contact with rotating components, that is
the rotary shaft or the elastic ring member, thus producing friction and
generating the heat of friction in the mutually contacted components. With air
turbines rotated with high revolutions, an extremely high temperature is reached
instantaneously, thus presenting serious danger.Document EP-A-0 322 896 reveals a dental handpiece comprising a head
part for accommodating a dental treatment tool, a grip part coupled and secured
to said head part for supporting said head part, engagement holding means
rotatably mounted within said head part and adapted for engaging with and
detachably holding a portion of the dental treatment tool introduced into said
head part, releasing means abuttable against said engagement holding means for
releasing

<CLAIMS>
A dental handpiece comprising

a head part (1) for accommodating a dental treatment tool (25),
a grip part (2) coupled and secured to said head part (1) for supporting said
head part (1),
engagement holding means (11) rotatably mounted within said head part
(1) and adapted for engaging with and detachably holding a portion (23) of

the dental treatment tool (25) introduced into said head part (1),
releasing means (17) abuttable against said engagement holding means (11)
for releasing engagement between said dental treatment tool (25) and the

engagement holding means (11), characterized in that

a mistaken operation prevention cover member (26) is provided detachably
sheathing said releasing means (17) for preventing mistaken operation of

said releasing means (17).
The dental handpiece as claimed in claim 1 wherein
said mistaken operation prevention cover member (26) comprises

a first holding tab (26b) for resiliently holding said head
part (1) and a second holding tab (26c) for resiliently

holding said gripping part (2).
The dental handpiece as claimed in claim 1 wherein

said engagement holding means (11) comprises a retention
portion (11e) for engaging with said portion (23) of the

dental treatment tool (25) and a spring portion (11d) for 
resiliently causing said retention portion (11e) to detachably

hold said portion (23) of the dental treatment tool (25).
The dental handpiece as claimed in claim 3 wherein
said releasing means (17) comprises an abutment cam (21, 22)

abuttable against said retention portion (11e) of said
engagement holding means (11) for releasing engagement of said

retention portion (11e) with the portion (23) of said dental
treatment tool (25) against the force of said spring portion

(11d).
