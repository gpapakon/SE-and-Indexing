<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a high capacity data communication 
network and to a network node suitable for the same. 
The network is based on a parallel architecture, linking the 
nodes of the network itself, having a plurality of logic 

communication media, wherein for each communication medium a 
different node of the network is primarily either advantaged or 

at a disadvantage. 
In this way the fairness of the traffic handling is assured aside 
from the type of protocol used.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a high capacity data communication
network and to a network node suitable for the same.In both local (LAN) and metropolitan (MAN) data communication
networks, one of the factors to be taken into account in evaluating
the communication protocol, is the possibility of a fair
sharing of the communication medium capacity among the network
nodes.For metropolitan area network a protocol, known as DQDB
(Distributed Queueing Dual Bus), has been standardized by the
IEEE 802.6 working group; for a detailed description of such
protocol one may refer, e.g., to the book of Martin De Prycker
titled "Asynchronous Transfer Mode: solution for Broadband ISDN",
London, Ellis Horwood, Nov. 1990, para. 6.5 "DQDB", pages 246 to
255.Such a protocol is based upon a dual bus architecture, in which
there are two network nodes that act also as head-end stations
generating and erasing slots over and from the network, and in
which all the network nodes transmit by capturing the free slots.One of the well known problems of such protocol is the "unfairness",
i.e. the fact that some nodes of the network are favoured
with respect to the others, more precisely: the nearer a node has
a position on the bus close to the head-end station, the greater
the probability of capturing a free slot will be; such advantage 
is reduced by the fact that the DQDB protocol has a slot-reserving
mechanism.Several solutions to this problem are known from the literature;
for a short review see, e.g., P. Davids et al., "Performance enhancement
in DQDB networks", Proceedings EFOC/LAN '92, pages 223
to 228, Paris, 24-26/06/92; such solutions do not solve totally
the problem; moreover they are not always easily and economically
implementable.The data communication networks, in particular the metropolitan
area networks, are nowadays required a higher and higher capacity
in terms of traffic transportation.Several solutions have been proposed using optical fibers and WDM
(Wavelength Division Multiplex) technique, among which the
parallel architecture based on DQDB protocol set forth by S. Casale
et al. in "A PARALLEL ARCHITECTURE FOR A DQDB MAN", Proceedings
ICCC '92 pages 415 to 419, Genoa, 28/09 - 02/10/1992, is of
particular interest.Also this parallel architecture has the problem of "unfairness"
since it is composed of a plurality of dual buses all connected
to the various nodes and using the DQDB protocol.It is an object of the present invention to overcome the drawbacks
of the known art and, in particular, to provide a
