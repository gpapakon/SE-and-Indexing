<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a bread improver composition, comprising 30 to 94 % by
weight, based on the weight of the total composition of an oil and/or oil mimetic component;

1 to 10 % by weight, based on the weight of the total composition, of a triglyceride fat; and a
particulate component, comprising 5 to 40 % by weight, based on the weight of the total

composition, of a high melting point emulsifier; and 0 to 60 % by weight, based on the weight
of the total composition of further bread improver additives.

<DESCRIPTION>
Bread improver compositions include a variety of additives intended to improve the quality of bread and other bakers' goods, for example cake mixes, and for leavened and unleavened baked products generally. They include emulsifiers, enzymes, antioxidants, sugars, food acids and acidity regulators, milk solids and vitamins and may be accompanied by a proportion of flour to facilitate admixture with remaining bakery ingredients consisting largely of flour. Fats and/or liquid glyceride oils are also present.It has been known for some time that it is desirable to provide a bread improver composition in a liquid form. The reason is that handling of these type of materials in powder form can be problematic. For instance, workers could breath in the powders. The powder can cause allergic reactions. Also, powders are more difficult to dose in industrial applications than fluid compositions. A prerequisite for liquid bread improver compositions is that they should be fluid at temperatures of about 5 to 25 °C and that they should be stable on storage at these temperatures, i.e. do not separate into distinct phases, including a precipitate, and keep their functionality over time.WO 99/48377 relates to a composition comprising an oil and/or oil mimetic component; a triglyceride fatty acid and/or a high melting point emulsifier component and a particulate component. The particulate component is in a stable suspension within a crystal matrix formed by the triglyceride fatty acid. The drawback of a composition according to this document is that only a relative small amount of functional ingredients such as emulsifiers can be incorporated in the bread improver.EP-A 0 572 051 describes liquid, bread improving compositions with improved stability that comprise 75-95 wt.% vegetable oil, 1-5 wt.% hydrogenated vegetable oil, 1-5 wt.% partly hydrogenated vegetable oil, 2-20 wt.% emulsifiers including DATA-esters, 0.1-0.5 wt.% enzymes and 0.1-1.0 wt.% oxidants. These products are prepared byt melting and mixing the fat components at 50-75°C, kneading and working the mixture through a Votator while cooling to a temperature of 20-32°C, fluidising the liquid dispersion of fat crystals with mild stirring for at least 1 hour at 25-35°C, adding the enzymes and the oxidants and stirring the resulting mixture from 30 minutes to 4 hours at ambient temperature.Derwent publication XP002167496 (patent abstract of JP59051742) relates to a composition which can be prepared by (a) heat-melting oil and fat, (b) cooling to below 40°C, (c)

<CLAIMS>
Liquid bread improver composition, comprising

(a) 30 to 94 % by weight, based on the weight of the total composition of an oil and/or oil mimetic component;
(b) 1 to 10 % by weight, based on the weight of the total composition, of a triglyceride fat; and
(c) a particulate component, comprising:

5 to 40 % by weight, based on the weight of the total composition, of a high melting point emulsifier having an iodine value of less than 20; and
0 to 60 % by weight, based on the weight of the total composition of further bread improver additives

wherein the component (b) forms a crystal lattice that helps to keep the particulate component suspended during prolonged storage.
Composition according to claim 1, wherein the high melting point emulsifier has a iodine value smaller than 20, preferably smaller than 10.
Composition according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the high melting point emulsifier has a dropping point higher than 50 °C, preferably higher than 60 °C.
Composition according to claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein the high melting point emulsifier is a diacetyl tartaric ester of saturated mono- and/or diglycerides or a saturated monoglyceride.
Composition according to claim 4, wherein the high melting point emulsifier is a saturated monoglyceride.
Composition according to any of the preceding claims, wherein the triglyceride fat has a melting point higher than 50 °C.
Composition according to claim 6, wherein the triglyceride fat is a fully hardened fat.
Composition according to any of the preceding claims, wherein the high melting point emulsifier is present in an amount of at least 7 % by weight, preferably at least 10 % by weight.
Composition according to any of the preceding claims, wherein component (a) is a liquid vegetable oil.
Composition according to any of the preceding claims, wherein the particulate component (c) has an average particle size of at least 10 µm.
Process for the preparation of a composition according to any of the preceding claims, comprising combining at least components (a) and (b) and adjusting and maintaining the temperature to allow formation of a fat matrix and adding component (c) whilst the mixture is agitated.
Process according to claim 11, wherein the combined components (a) and (b) are equilibrated at a temperature between 10 and 25°C for a sufficiently long period of time to ensure that a stable crystalline fat matrix is obtained, after which component (c) is added under agitation.
