<ABSTRACT>
Timing of a DRAM used in static column mode is improved by 
extending the valid write time to be equal to the write 

time for that DRAM used in fast page mode. The global write 
enable signal (GWE) is extended and the address in the 

address latch (28) is maintained to increase the valid 
write time. Preferably a timing circuit is used. Also, the 

circuit improves noise margin in static column mode by 
decoupling the write enable (/WE) and column address strobe 

(/CAS) signals after they are initially received to ignore 
any noise in those signals.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a DRAM comprising a circuit for
extending the valid write time in said DRAM when used
in static column mode, of the kind defined
in the preamble of Claim 1.
A DRAM of this kind is disclosed in US-A-5 077 693.Dynamic random access memories (DRAMs) can be categorized
into one of two groups depending upon the operating mode of
the device. One group includes the static column mode
devices and the other includes the fast page mode devices.
While the fast page mode devices are more common, static
column mode devices are still used in large numbers. One
primary difference between the devices resides in the
latching of address information. The difference in
latching address information may lead to certain advantages
and disadvantages in the respective devices. For example,
a static column mode device may have a slightly faster
access time than a fast page mode device, but generally
will have a slower cycle time.Certain control signals are required to access (i.e. read
data from or write data to) a DRAM. In particular, the
primary control signals (shown in Figure 1) required to
access a DRAM are the row address strobe /RAS, column
address strobe /CAS (also commonly referred to as a column
enable signal /CE), and the write enable signal /WE. (It
will be understood that the forward slash placed before a
given signal will indicate an inverted state of the given
signal. Typically, the inverted state of a signal is
indicated when an input to a circuit requires an active low
signal, or the circuit generates an active low output.)An active low /RAS indicates that the proper row address
has been provided. Because static column mode and fast 
page mode devices are "page mode" devices, additional data
can be read from the memory or written to the memory
without certain address information having to be repeated.
For example, the row address may be maintained with a low
/RAS signal while the column address may be changed. An
active low /CAS indicates that the proper column address
has been provided. Finally, an active low /WE indicates
that a write function is to be performed and that data is
to be written to the memory. These signals are established
by practice in the industry and, therefore, the certain
pulse widths of the signals have become de facto standards.As defined by de facto standards established in the
industry, an active low /WE signal is shorter than an
active low /CAS signal. For example, while the duration of
the active low /CAS pulse (designated as tCAS in Figure 1)
in a particular
