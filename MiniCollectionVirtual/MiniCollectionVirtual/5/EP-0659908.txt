<CLAIMS>
A process for removing lead dioxide residues on 
conducting surfaces, which comprises cathodically 

reducing the lead dioxide, the electrolyte being 
used is dilute nitric acid. 
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
electrolyte used is nitric acid having a strength of 

from 2 to 10% by weight. 
The process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the 
support for the lead dioxide residues is a steel 

surface.
