digital signal the characterized portions thereof as information 

representative of the surge wave form, memory means (17) 
for storing predetermined reference information concerning 

the nature of surges, and discriminating means for comparing 
said information representative of the surge wave form with 

said reference information stored in said memory means to 
discriminate the kind of surge.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a surge discriminating
system for detecting the characteristics of
the waveform of a surge occurring on a power transmission
line to determine whether the surge is due to lightning
flashover, including back flashover and direct strike, to
inductive strike, or AC fault, including grounding and short
circuit, so as to locate not only the point where the fault
occurred but also the point where the inductive strike
occurred and to discriminate the characteristics thereof.There is known a power transmission line fault locating
system of the surge-receiving type (IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery, vol. 8, no. 3, 1993, P. 1295 - 1302) wherein a master
station and a slave station merely independently receive
surges and one or the other calculates the difference between
the surge receiving times based on a synchronization
signal via a communication network of a grounding system so
as to locate the point where the surge occurred. However
this system can only locate the point where the surge occurred
and can not discriminate what kind of surge occurred.In another conventional system, the kind of fault is
detected by a protective relay provided in a substation
separately from the fault locating system. Information based
on the detection by the protective relay is displayed by a
display unit near the protective relay in the substation or 
is transferred via the communication network to the sites
where the information is required.In many cases, however, the sites are provided with
the information, they require by a phone call from a person
at the substation or the like. As a result, the sites often
do not receive the information promptly, which is likely to
delay the start of the restoration work.Furthermore, the protective relay must be of large
capacity and is subject to extremely large loads. What is
more, it can not detect inductive strikes.While a detector for discriminating if an over-current
is caused by a lightning flashover or other
reasons is known from the JP-A-05 227 650, this
means is different from that the invention relates toIt is therefore an object of the present invention to
provide a surge discriminating system for discriminating the
kind of surge, including those due to the occurrence of a
fault and the occurrence of an inductive strike.It is another object of the present invention to
provide a surge discriminating and locating system capable
not only of discriminating the kind of surge, including
those due to the occurrence of a fault and the occurrence of
an
