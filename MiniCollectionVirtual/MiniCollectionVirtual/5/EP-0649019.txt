<ABSTRACT>
The instrument contains a device connected to a sealing body (10), in order to apply pressure to the packing in a chromatography column, and a force accumulator (11) which is functionally connected to the device, in order to sustain the pressure applied to the packing. The instrument is connected to a column (2) to form a chromatography device. The device is distinguished by its wide range of application and its ease of use.

Apparatus for the axial compression of a column for chromatography,
comprising an energy accumulator (11), wherein the column is

provided with a filling and can be closed off at the ends by means of
a first closure body and a second closure body, characterised by a

cylindrical housing (3) and a cover (6) with a through-aperture
which closes the housing (3) at one end, by a threaded spindle (7)

which passes through the cover (6) and is in operative connection
with the first closure body (10) in order to displace the first closure

body in the column and to apply pressure to the filling, by a nut (8)
and by a part (14) which is connected, on the one hand, to the nut

(8) and, on the other hand, is guided in a slot (15) such that the nut
(8) is rotationally fixedly arranged on the threaded spindle (7), with

the energy accumulator (11) being disposed between the nut (8) and
the cover (6) of the housing (3) and partly surrounding the threaded

spindle (7), with the nut being displaced by rotation of the threaded
spindle (7) against the energy accumulator (11) in order to transfer

the pressure applied to the filling to the energy accumulator (11),
and with the energy accumulator being further intended to maintain

this pressure.
Apparatus in accordance with claim 1, characterized in that the energy
accumulator (11) consists of plate springs.
Apparatus in accordance with claim 1, characterized in that the
threaded spindle (7) is connected to the first closure body (10). 
Apparatus in accordance with claim 1, characterized by a drive device
(16) which is connected to the threaded spindle (7).
Apparatus in accordance with claim 1, characterized in that a first
filter unit (18) is arranged in the first closure body (10) and in that

the filter unit is a sintered body.
Apparatus in accordance with claim 5, characterized in that the filter
unit (18) comprises at least two members which consist of a

material selected from the group glass, ceramic, metal or plastic.
Apparatus in accordance with claim 1, characterized in that the
threaded spindle (7) is a hollow spindle, and in that a feed line (17)

is provided which is led through the hollow spindle and opens into
the filter unit of the first closure body (10).
Apparatus for chromatography comprising a column (2) and an apparatus
in accordance with one of the claims 2 to 7, characterized in

that the column (2) contains a tube (21), a holding means (22) with
two flanges (25) which contact the ends of the tube, three tie-bars

(26) which hold the flanges on the tube, a second closure body (24)
and a closure flange (23) and is formed as a module, and in that the

apparatus (1) is installed on the holding means (22), with the column
(2) being closed off, on the one hand, by the apparatus and, on

the other hand, by the second closure body (24).
Apparatus in accordance with claim 8, characterized in that the
tube (21) consists of a material selected from the group glass, ceramic,

metal or plastic. 
Apparatus in accordance with claim 9, characterized in that a second
filter unit (18) is arranged in the second closure body (10) and

in that the filter unit is a sintered body.
Apparatus in accordance with claim 9, characterized in that the
second filter unit (18) comprises at least two members which consist

of a material selected from the group glass) ceramic, metal or plastic.
Method for the operation of the apparatus in accordance with one of
the claims 8 to 11, characterized in that the column is provided with

a filling; in that the apparatus is installed on the column; and in
that the filling is initially pressed (compressed) by means of the apparatus

and the maximum pressure is subsequently applied.
