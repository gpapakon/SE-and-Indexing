A vehicle door, in particular a motor vehicle door, of a 
frame-type structure, which includes a load-bearing door frame (1) 

forming a door support module (1a) and having at least a front and a rear 
and an upper and a lower frame portion (2, 3, 4, 5) respectively and 

which has further door elements characterised in that the lower frame 
portion (5) and the front and the rear frame portions (2, 3) are each 

respective extrusion portions (20) and are provided at least over a part 
of their length with a hollow and/or hex cross-section (21) serving as a 

support and with at least one limb (22) serving as an intermediate and 
connecting portion (13 to 15 and 16 to 18 respectively). 
A vehicle door according to claim 1 characterised in that the 
limbs (22) are cut to size to form intermediate portions (13-15). 
A vehicle door according to one or are of the preceding 
claims characterised in that the limbs (22) have respective narrow and 

elongate edge portions/angled portions (24), which serve for fixing 
internal door portions. 
A vehicle door according to one or are of the preceding 
claims characterised in that the at least partially angled limb (22) of 

the extrusion portion (20) extends as a prolongation of the profile 
portion (27) of the hollow and/or hex cross-section (21), which profile 

portion forms the outside contour (26) of the door frame (1). 
A vehicle door according to one or more of the preceding 
claims characterised in that a guide channel (29) for a window pane is at 

the same time integrated into the hollow and/or hex cross-section (21) of 
the extrusion portion (20) into the profile portion which forms the 

internal contour (28) of the door frame (1).  
 
A vehicle door according to one or are of the preceding 
claims characterised in that the limb (22) is angled. 
A frame portion for a vehicle door characterised by an 
extrusion with a hollow and/or hex cross-section (21) serving as a 

support and with at least one limb (22) serving as an intermediate and 
connecting portion (13 to 15 and 16 to 18 respectively). 
A blank for a frame portion for a vehicle door characterised 
by an extrusion with a respective hollow and/or hex cross-section (21) 

serving as a support and with at least one limb (22) serving as an
