<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a card edge connector with 
a housing (16) having a card edge receiving area, end supports 

located at opposite ends of the card edge receiving 
area. It supports outriggers (36), the end supports (38) 

each extending up from a top surface of the housing (16) and 
having a slot (42) for receiving a portion of a printed 

circuit board (12). The outriggers extend outward from lateral 
sides of the housing (16) at a bottom of the housing 

(16); and electrical contacts (18) are mounted to the

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to electrical connectors and, 
more particularly, to a card edge connector. The art is replete with different types and kinds of card 
edge connectors. U.S. Patent 4,846,734 and 4,934,961 show 
two different types of card edge connectors. U.S. Patent 
5,052,936 shows a card edge connector with contacts having 
surface mount solder tails and the housing having 
standoffs. U.S. Patent 4,487,468 shows a card edge 
connector with guide rails at opposite ends of the 
connector. U.S. Patent 3,665,375 discloses guides with 
slots to orientate a daughter board relative to a 
connection block. Burndy Corporation has manufactured card 
edge connectors with standoffs at both ends and extending 
outwardly from the housing to stably mount the connector on 
a mother board. In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, 
a card edge connector is provided comprising a housing and 
electrical contacts. The housing has a card edge receiving 
area, end supports located at opposite ends of the card 
receiving area, and outriggers. The end supports each have 
a slot for receiving a portion of a printed circuit board 
and extending up from a top surface of the housing. The 
outriggers extend outwardly from lateral sides of the 
housing at a bottom of the housing. The electrical 
contacts are mounted to the housing. In accordance with another embodiment of the present  
 
invention, a card edge connector is provided comprising a 
housing and electrical contacts. The housing is comprised 
of a one-piece molded dielectric material having a center 
section and end sections located on opposite ends of the 
center section. The center section has a card edge 
receiving area and outriggers extending laterally outward 
from longitudinal sides of the center section at a bottom 
of the housing. The end sections also have outriggers 
extending laterally outward from the end sections. The 
electrical contacts are mounted to the housing. In accordance with another embodiment of the present 
invention, a card edge connector and printed circuit board 
assembly is provided comprising a mother printed circuit 
board, a card edge connector, and a daughter printed 
circuit board. The card edge connector is connected to the 
mother board and has a housing with a plurality of spring 
contacts. The housing has a center section with a card 
edge receiving area and two end sections with upwardly 
extending card end supports. The center section is 
substantially shorter in height than the end sections and

A connector as in claim 1, further comprising metal 
through-hole latches (56) connected to the housing (16) 

and extending from the bottom of the housing. 
A connector as in claim 3, wherein each latch (56) has a 
pair of spring legs (58) with at least one latch (56) 

having its pair of spring legs (58) orientated differently 
than one of the other pairs of spring legs (58). 
A connector as in claim 1, wherein the end support slots 
(42) each have an open top end (44), an open inner side 

(46) that faces the other slot, and remaining bottom end 
and sides are enclosed. 
A connector as in claim 1, wherein the height of the 
housing (16) is about 0.22 inch except at the end supports 

(42) which has a height of about 0.61 inch. 
A connector as in claim 6, wherein the depth of the card 
edge receiving area is about 0.175 inch. 
A connector as in claim 1, wherein the electrical contacts 
(18) have surface mount solder tails (50) that 

extend from the bottom of the housing with an extended 
length to allow for increased deflection and stress absorption. 
A card edge connector comprising:
