<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polymeric substance
and a specific additive for the screening of solar radiation
with the aim of influencing plant growth and the morphogenesis.It is necessary for a controllable growth of plants
to set up special light conditions to affect plant growth and
morphogenesis. Special light conditions for plant growth, for
example, within a greenhouse or under a mulch film include
some which are of particular interest. The temperature within
the enclosed area and the light intensity and the spectral
distribution of the incoming light are important factors for
the plant growth.Plants, for example, in a greenhouse will grow not so
well if the variations in temperature between day and night,
because of too much sunlight at day and because of too large
a decline in temperature at night, are too large since they
build a resistance to the variations in temperature. From
this it follows that the plants stay back in growth. Thus,
for the photosynthesis in greenhouses the photosynthetically
active radiation (PAR) is only desired while other parts of
the solar light should be screened because they have mainly a
negative influence on the microclimate. Therefore the following
objectives have to be achieved. Firstly, the intensive
irradiation by sunlight in particular by NIR radiation needs
to be screened, in order to avoid too high temperatures within
the enclosed area. Secondly, the incoming light beams are
to be scattered in order to prevent burnings on plants.
Thirdly, heat within the area is to be stored at night.However, in case of mulch films the opposite effect
is desired. The PAR should be screened and all other parts of
the solar light should be transmitted. Mulch films are used
in agriculture to improve the growing conditions of the useful
plants and to minimize the use of chemical herbicides.For certain crop growers want to intervene in the
plant morphogenesis. Morphogenesis is the influence from environmental
factors on the shape and appearance of the plant.
One of them is the light quality. It means that the spectral
energy distribution has an effect on the growth of plants. Raviv and Allingham describe in "Plastic culture"
No. 59, 'September 1989, pp. 3 to 12, that diffuse light is
favourable for a steady growth of plants. Furthermore, it
turned out that diffuse light has the advantage that the
plants are not going to be damaged. Hancock describes in
"Plastic Culture", No. 79, 1988, pp. 4 to 14, that special
additives in LDPE have a favourable effect on the microclimate
