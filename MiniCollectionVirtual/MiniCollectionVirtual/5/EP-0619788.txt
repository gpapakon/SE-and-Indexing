<ABSTRACT>
The construction of a railway vehicle providing improved passenger comfort, especially during acceleration and braking, is facilitated by a chassis member (1) for at least an individual wheel (6) in which the chassis member (1) is secured at one end to the body (3) of the railway vehicle via a longitudinal stabiliser (2) to be vertically movable and horizontally fixed and is supported at both ends to the vehicle body (3) via compression springs (4, 5).

<CLAIMS>
Chassis side-piece (1) for at least one single 
wheel (6) of a rail vehicle, whereby the chassis side-piece 

(1) is connected at one end by way of a 
longitudinal stabilizer (2) to a car body (3) of the 

rail vehicle so as to be vertically moveable and 
horizontally fixed and it is supported at both ends on 

the car body (3) by way of load springs (4, 5). 
Chassis side-piece (1) according to claim 1, 
whereby the single wheel (6) is mounted in the chassis 

side-piece (1) so as to be horizontally pivoted and it 
can be controlled horizontally relative to the chassis 

side-piece (6) by means of at least one actuator (7). 
Chassis side-piece (1) according to claim 1 or 
2, whereby the load springs (4, 5) are formed as 

compressed-air springs which can be loaded with 
compressed air in a load-dependent manner. 
Chassis side-piece (1) according to one of 
claims 1 to 3, whereby in the region of the single 

wheel (6) at least one guide element (9,22) is provided 

to absorb transverse and torsional forces, which 
element is fastened at its lower end to the chassis 

side-piece (1) and at its upper end in the lateral 
wheel case (8) of the car body (3). 
Chassis side-piece (1) according to claim 4, 
whereby the guide element (9,22) is connected to the 

chassis side-piece (1) above the hub of the single 
wheel (6). 
Chassis side-piece (1) according to one of 
claims 1 to 5, whereby in the region of the single 

wheel (6) there is provided a vibration-absorber 
element (15) acting in the longitudinal and/or 

transverse direction, which element is connected to the 
chassis side-piece (1) and is arranged in the lateral 

wheel case (8) of the car body (3). 
Chassis side-piece (1) according to claim 6,  
 

whereby the vibration-absorber element (15) is formed 
with four arms, and two arms (151,152) point parallel 

to the longitudinal vehicle axis and two arms (153,154) 
point parallel to the transverse vehicle axis. 
Chassis side-piece (1) according to claim 7, 
whereby between the arms (151,152) of the vibration-absorber 

element (15) pointing in the longitudinal 
direction and the wheel case (8) spring elements 

(18,19) are arranged to absorb the high-frequency 
collision excitations. 
Chassis side-piece (1) according to claim 7, 
whereby at the arms (153,154) of the vibration-absorber 

element (15) pointing in the transverse direction and 
at the wheel case (8) spring elements (20,21) are 

arranged to absorb the transverse acceleration forces. 
Chassis side-piece (1) according to one of 
claims 1 to 9, whereby between the load springs (4,5) 

and the hub of the single wheel (6) there is arranged 
in each case an absorbing element (16,17) connected to 

the wheel case (8) of the car body (3) to absorb the 
longitudinal vibrations. 
Chassis side-piece (1) according to claim 7 
and 10, whereby the absorbing element (16,17) is 

connected to the arms (151,152) of the vibration-absorber 
element (15) which are arranged parallel to 

the longitudinal vehicle axis. 
Chassis side-piece (1) according to claim 5, 
whereby an absorbing element (23) is integrated into 

the guide element (22). 
Chassis side-piece (1) according to claim 10 
or 12, whereby the degree of absorption of the 

absorbing elements (16,17,23) can be controlled in a 
load-dependent manner. 
Chassis side-piece (1) according to one of 
claims 1 to 13, whereby at its side facing the rail a 

rail braking device (27) is arranged, which includes a  
 

height-adjustable brake body (28) which can be rotated 
horizontally. 
Chassis side-piece (1) according to claim 14, 
whereby the brake body (28) is fastened in a height-adjustable 

manner to the chassis side-piece (1) by way 
of a horizontally rotatable brake support (29). 
Chassis side-piece (1) according to claim 15, 
whereby the rail braking device (27) includes a carrier 

device (30) firmly connected to the chassis side-piece 
(1), in which device the brake support (29) is mounted 

in a horizontally rotatable manner. 
Chassis side-piece (1) according to claim 16, 
whereby the brake body (28) can be displaced relative 

to the brake support (29) in the longitudinal direction 
until limitation by way of the carrier device (30).
