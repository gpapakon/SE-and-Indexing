<ABSTRACT>
The piston of a piston/cylinder unit of a belt tensioner with pyrotechnic gas generator is characterised in that the piston is composed of a first metal piston part (12) which is fixedly connected to the pulling cable (16) and of at least one second piston part (14) made of a thermoplastic material, at least one section of which being arranged on that side of the first piston part (12) which faces the gas generator and being tightly sealed to the cylinder wall. This design creates the structural conditions under which advantageous further developments of the piston can be carried out in order to improve the safety of the belt tensioner. The piston may, in particular, be provided with a sealing lip, which is released from the inside wall of the cylinder of the piston/cylinder unit when the unit is heated, for example when the vehicle is on fire, and in this process provides a path through which gas can escape in order to avoid the danger of an explosion. Furthermore, damping devices may be provided on the piston in order to reduce the load peaks which occur at the start of the tensioning process.

<CLAIMS>
A belt pretensioner comprising a pyrotechnic gas 
generator and a piston and cylinder unit which is adapted to 

be activated by the gases generated by the gas generator and 
whose piston (12, 14) is connected with a cable (16), the 

piston comprising a first metal piston part (12) fixedly 
connected with the cable (16) and at least a second piston 

part (14) of plastic material, at least a section of the 
second piston part being arranged on the side of the first 

piston part (12) which faces the gas generator and being in 
tight engagement with the cylinder wall, characterized in 

that the plastic material of the second piston part (14) is 
a thermoplastic material which, when excessively heated, 

e.g. in case of a vehicle fire, is deformed in a manner as 
to cancel the tight engagement at least partially and to 

open a passage from the side of the piston (12, 14) facing 
the gas generator to the side of the piston facing away from 

the gas generator. 
The belt pretensioner as claimed in claim 1, characterized 
in that the second piston part (14) is spaced from 

the first piston part (12) and arranged displaceably on the 
cable (16). 
The belt pretensioner as claimed in claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that between the first and second piston 

parts (12, 14) damping means (18; 22; 24, 25; 26, 28, 30; 
32) are provided which are designed to yield elastically 

and/or plastically under the action of a force.  
 
The belt pretensioner as claimed in claim 3, characterized 
in that the damping means is constituted by an 

elastomer plate (32). 
The belt pretensioner as claimed in claim 3, characterized 
in that the means (18; 22; 24, 25; 26, 28, 30) are 

molded on the first and/or on the second piston part (12, 
14). 
The belt pretensioner as claimed in claim 3, characterized 
in that the damping means are constituted by raised 

portions (18; 22; 24, 25; 26) and/or recesses on the first 
and/or the second piston part (12, 14). 
The belt pretensioner as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the first piston 

part (12) has a smaller external diameter than the second 
piston part (14). 
The belt pretensioner as claimed in claim 7, characterized 
in that the second piston part (14) is shaped as a 

hollow cylinder and open towards the first piston part 
(12). 
The belt pretensioner as claimed in claim 8, characterized 
in that the first piston part (12) is arranged at 

least partly in the interior of the second piston part 
(14). 
The belt pretensioner as claimed in claim 9, characterized 
in that the lateral wall (34) of the second piston 

part (14) tapers on the side facing away from the gas 
generator. 
The belt pretensioner as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the second piston 

part (14) has a seal (20) providing a sealing action between  
 

the second piston part and the inner side of the cylinder 
(10). 
The belt pretensioner as claimed in claim 11, characterized 
in that a sealing lip (20) molded on the second 

piston part (14) constitutes said seal. 
The belt pretensioner as claimed in claim 12, characterized 
in that the sealing lip (20) is arranged on the side 

of the second piston part (14) facing the gas generator. 
The belt pretensioner as claimed in any of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the second piston part (14) is 

longitudinally divided into two sections (14a, 14b). 
The belt pretensioner as claimed in claim 14, characterized 
in that the two sections (14a, 14b) of the second 

piston part (14) are assembled around the first piston part 
(12). 
The belt pretensioner as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the second piston 

part (14) comprises polypropylene, polyamide or polyformaldehyde.
