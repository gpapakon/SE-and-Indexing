<ABSTRACT>
A computer-controlled printing system includes a host 
computer, an intelligent printer and an intelligent post 

printer processor. The print job is controlled by defining 
print data, printer control data and printer post processor 

control data in a print data stream from the host computer. 
The print data and printer control data are read at the 

intelligent printer. The intelligent printer executes the 
print control data to print the print data on a print medium. 

The printer also determines if there is post processor control 
data in the print data stream and, if so, sends the post 

processor control data from the printer to the intelligent post 
processor. The post processor reads the post processor control 

data, and executes the post processor control data to perform 
selected modification of the print medium. Selectable 

modifications of the print medium at the post processor include 
predetermined fixed printing of images, symbols or text, 

perforation of the print medium, cutting of the print medium, 
or user defined modifications of the print medium.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to a method and apparatus for 
selectable control of post-print processing functions in a 
printer system via user controlled application program. More 
particularly, the invention provides for selectable control of 
modifications to the print medium in a print job controlled 
from a print data stream where an intelligent post-printer 
processor is controlled via an intelligent printer data stream. In computer controlled high-volume printing operations, 
the computer typically controls a high speed printer, such as 
the IBM 3835. The printer may perform functions such as 
cutting sheets, collating sheets, stapling collated sheets, and 
binding documents. The print functions and sheet handling 
functions at the printer and sheet handling functions at the 
post processor have been handled as a single print job. More recently, data processors have been post-printer 
processors and, thus, creating intelligent post processors. 
These intelligent post processors have some conventional medium 
handling functions, such as cutting or perforating the medium, 
and have also added enhanced medium modification functions. 
These enhanced functions include printing predetermined fixed 
information such as images, symbols or text at predetermined 
locations on printed sheets or pages. Also this fixed 
information may be printed in selectable colors. An example of 
an application of this post-printer fixed printing is the 
printing of a company logo on the printed sheets. Exemplary of 
such a post-print processor is the Color Imprinter post 
processor, a product of BESTE Bunch.  To date, intelligent post processors have not been 
controlled by the print data stream controlling the printer. 
The printing system prints the documents, and the printed 
documents are moved to the post-printer processor for the 
additional printing of fixed messages, symbols, or logos, on 
the printed sheets. The prior art includes printers, as shown in U.S. Patents 
5,018,078 and 5,163,122, that disclose an image processing 
system in which images, as well as text, are interactively 
edited and processed as a block for printing. In addition, 
U.S. Patent 5,060,980 discloses a computer-based print form 
design tool. A user can create a form, or edit a form, by 
choosing from a variety of alphanumeric, graphic or image 
fields. U.S. Patent 5,075,875 discloses a control system that 
enables forms with logos to be downloaded to a raster image 
processor in a laser printer. JP 61-018674 discloses an 
image-forming

In a computer-controlled printing system having a host 
computer, an intelligent printer and an intelligent post 

printer processor with selectable operations for 
modification of printed sheets from the intelligent 

printer, a method for controlling a print job from the 
host computer through the printer for printing sheets and 

through the post processor for selectable modification of 
printed sheets, said method comprising the steps of: 

building for each print job a print data stream at the 
host computer, said print data stream including print 

data, printer control data and post processor control 
data; 

reading the data stream at the intelligent printer; 
separating the print data and printer control data from 

the post processor control data at the printer; 
printing at the intelligent printer the print data, using 

the print control data to control the printer on sheets in 
a print medium to produce printed sheets; 

sending the post processor control data from the printer 
to the intelligent post processor;
