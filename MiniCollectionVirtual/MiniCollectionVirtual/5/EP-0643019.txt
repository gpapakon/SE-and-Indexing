<ABSTRACT>
A glassmelting method employing reducing and 
oxidizing conditions generated by defined combustion 

arrangements enabling the processing of glassmaking 
materials while reducing NOx emissions which would 

otherwise result from, for example, niter 
decomposition. The NOx is reduced to nitrogen under 

the reducing conditions and kept from reforming in the 
oxidizing zone.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to glassmaking
and more particularly to the processing of glassmaking
materials such as in a glassmelting furnaceIn the making of glass a very large amount of heat
is needed to melt the glassmaking materials as they are
processed in a glassmelting furnace. Generally this
heat is provided by the combustion of fuel and oxidant
which has heretofore generally been air.Nitrogen oxides (NOx) are recognized pollutants
and it is desirable to reduce emissions of NOx from
industrial processes. NOx is produced in air-based
combustion mainly because at the high temperatures of
the combustion reaction, nitrogen from the air combines
with oxygen.Recently in response to the NOx problem many
industrial processes have begun using pure oxygen or
oxygen-enriched air to carry out the combustion as this
reduces or completely eliminates the nitrogen brought
into the area of the combustion reaction by the
oxidant.In the processing of glassmaking materials such as
in a glassmaking furnace, while the use of oxygen or
oxygen-enriched air has indeed served to reduce the NOx
emissions over what would have been expected if air
were the oxidant, the reduction in NOx generation has
not been as great as should be expected when the batch
materials contained niter. Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to
provide a method for processing glassmaking materials
with reduced emissions of nitrogen oxides.Applicants believe that the problem of higher than
expected NOx generation in the processing of
glassmaking materials results primarily from the use of
niter as an oxidizer in the glassmaking materials
wherein the niter decomposes to form NOx.Accordingly, it is a further object of the
invention to provide a method for processing niter-containing
glassmaking materials to achieve reduced
levels of nitrogen oxides emissions.The above and other objects which will become
apparent to one skilled in the art upon a reading of
this disclosure are attained by:A method for processing glassmaking materials with
reduced emissions of nitrogen oxides as defined in claim 1. As used herein the terms "nitrogen oxides" and
"NOx" mean one or more of nitrous oxide (N2O), nitric
oxide (NO), nitrogen trioxide (N2O3), dinitrogen
tetroxide (N2O4), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), trinitrogen
tetroxide (N3O4) and nitrogen trioxide (NO3).As used herein the term "niter" means one or more
nitrate compounds such as sodium nitrate (NaNO3) and
potassium nitrate (KNO3).As used herein the term "products of complete
combustion" means one or
