<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for continuous production of polyurethane slab-stock foam using carbon dioxide (40), dissolved physically under pressure, as the foaming agent. Before mixing the constituents polyhydric alcohol (36) and isocyanate (35), said carbon dioxide (40) is dissolved in the polyhydric alcohol constituent, and air or nitrogen (39) is dissolved in the isocyanate constituent. Both constituents are delivered to a mixing chamber (3) in which there is a pressure 70 to 150 % of the solution pressure of the CO2 in the polyhydric alcohol constituent. The isocyanate constituent is delivered at a pressure of at least 30 bar to the mixing chamber, and by dropping to the mixing chamber pressure is sprayed into said mixing chamber. Air or nitrogen amounting to 1 g per kg of CO2 is dissolved in the isocyanate constituent, and the mixture drops to atmospheric pressure on leaving the mixing chamber.

A process for the continuous production of polyurethane block foam using
carbon dioxide which is physically dissolved under pressure as a foaming agent,

wherein before the polyol and isocyanate components are mixed the carbon
dioxide is dissolved in the polyol component and air or nitrogen is dissolved in

the isocyanate component, both components are fed to a mixing chamber in
which a pressure prevails which is 70 to 150 % of the solution pressure of the

CO
2
 in the polyol component, the isocyanate component is fed to the mixing
chamber at a pressure which is at least 10 bar higher than the mixing chamber

pressure and is injected therein with depressurisation down to the mixing
chamber pressure, wherein air or nitrogen in an amount of at least 1 g per kg

CO
2
 is dissolved in the isocyanate component, and after emerging from the
mixing chamber the mixture is depressurised to atmospheric pressure.
A process according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 0.5 to 6 parts by weight of
carbon dioxide, with respect to 100 parts by weight of polyol, are dissolved in

the polyol component, and the mixing chamber pressure is 2 to 30 bar.
A process according to claims 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 air in an amount of 4
to 6 g per kg CO
2
 is dissolved in the isocyanate.
A process according to any one of claims I to 3, 
characterised in that
 a pressure
prevails in the mixing chamber which corresponds to 80 to 130 % of the

solution pressure of the CO
2
 in the polyol component.
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that
 2 to 6
parts by weight of carbon dioxide, with respect to 100 parts by weight of polyol,

are dissolved in the polyol component.
