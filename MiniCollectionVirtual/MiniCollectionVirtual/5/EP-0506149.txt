This invention relates to certain chemical intermediates
useful for preparing fungicidal, insecticidal and miticidal
derivatives of propenoic acid.European patent No. 0370629, of which the present
application is a divisional, claims in respect of the
Contracting State GR a compound having the formula (I):

respect of the Contracting States AT, BE, CH, DE, FR, GB, IT,
LI, LU, NL and SE the same compounds are claimed with the
proviso that when A is hydrogen, neither R1 nor R2 is
optionally substituted heteroarylalkyl or R1 and R2 do not join
to form a heterocyclic ring system. This proviso takes
account of compounds disclosed in EP-A-0403618.The compounds contain at least one carbon-nitrogen double
bond and at least one carbon-carbon double bond, and are
sometimes obtained in the form of mixtures of geometric
isomers which can be separated into individual isomers.The individual isomers which result from the
unsymmetrically substituted double bond of the propenoate
group and the oxime are identified by the commonly used terms
"E" and "Z". These terms are defined according to the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog
system which is fully described in the
literature (see, for example, J March, "Advanced Organic
Chemistry", 3rd edition, Wiley-Interscience, page 109 etseq).For the carbon-carbon double bond of the
