<ABSTRACT>
A control valve comprises a valve body having a fluid 
channel and a valve seat; a valve operating part (B); a valve 

stem supporting member (3) having its upper end fixed to the 
valve operating part (B) and its lower end fixed to the valve 

body (A); a valve stem (20) penetrating the valve stem supporting 
member and having its upper end part connected to the valve 

operating part and its lower end part entering the valve 
body, the valve stem being movable upward or downward by 

the valve operating part; and a valve element attached to 
the lower end of the valve stem. The valve element is 

moved upward or downward by moving the valve stem upward or 
downward, the valve element being brought into contact with 

and seated in the valve seat to close a fluid channel as it 
is moved downward, the valve element being detached from 

the valve seat to open the fluid channel as it is moved 
upward. The valve stem (3) supporting member has an upper 

tubular body (14C) and a lower tubular body (14A), the upper tubular 
body (14C) having its upper end fixed to the valve operating part (B) 

and its lower end detached from the valve body (A), the lower 
tubular body (14A) having its lower end fixed to the valve body (A) 

and its upper end detached from the valve operating part (B), 
the two tubular bodies being spaced apart each other, the 

lower end part of the upper tubular body and the upper end 
part of the lower tubular body being connected by a 

connecting member (17).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a control valve. The terms "upward" and "downward" and like terms as 
used herein and in the appended claims are merely intended 
to express the position relation between the components of 
the control valve as arranged in the drawings showing the 
embodiment to be described below. These terms should not 
be interpreted as expressing the absolute "up-down" 
relation in the state in which the control valve is used. The control valve comprises a valve body having a 
fluid channel and a valve seat; a valve operating part; a 
valve stem supporting member having its upper end fixed to 
the valve operating part and its lower end fixed to the 
valve body respectively; a valve stem penetrating the valve 
stem supporting member and having its upper end part 
connected to the valve operating part and its lower end 
part entering the valve body, the valve stem being movable 
upwardly or downwardly by means of the valve operating 
part; and a valve element attached to the lower end of the 
valve stem. The valve element is moved upward or downward 
by moving the valve stem upward or downward. The valve 
element is brought into contact with and seated in the 
valve seat to close the fluid channel as it is moved  
 
downward. The valve element is detached from the valve 
seat to open the fluid channel as it is moved upward. Conventionally, this type of control valve has the 
valve stem supporting member formed by a single tubular 
body made of metal. However, in the conventional control valve having the 
valve stem supporting member formed by a single tubular 
body made of metal, when a fluid in a low temperature or a 
high temperature flows through the fluid channel of the 
valve body, heat inflows or outflows through the valve stem 
supporting member between the valve operating part and the 
fluid, and consequently entailing a problem wherein a the 
fluid alters its temperature. The object of the present invention is to solve the 
above mentioned problem and to provide a control valve 
wherein amount of heat inflowing or outflowing through the 
valve stem supporting member is reduced between the valve 
operating part and the fluid. The control valve of the present invention comporises 
a valve body having a fluid channel and a valve seat; a 
valve operating part; a valve stem supporting member having 
its upper end fixed to the valve operating part and its 
lower end fixed to the valve body respectively; a valve  
 
stem penetrating the valve stem supporting member and 
having its
