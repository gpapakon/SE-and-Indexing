<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to collector devices,
and more particularly to a "sharps" collector for devices
such as syringes.The term "sharps" applies to any sharp device used in
medical applications, such as hypodermic needles, lances,
and the like. The dangers of disposing of these devices
after use have become more prevalent with expanding
diseases such as AIDS and hepatitis. Before disposal, the
used devices must be contained such that exposure to
others is minimized. These disposal problems are present
in hospitals and doctor's offices, and are also present in
home settings. Diabetics, for example, and others must
dispose of numerous used needles and syringes. There are
presently over two million diabetics in the United States,
each of whom use an average of one and one-half syringes
per day.In addition to the problem of providing a receptacle
for receiving used syringes, the container itself must be
disposable, hold a reasonable number of syringes, insure
that the syringes are stacked or packed in some suitable
way, be safe to use without a deposited syringe sticking
out or reemerging from the receptacle, be secure so that
a child or animal cannot reach in and injure themselves on
the discarded syringes contained therein, be closeable for
disposal, and be puncture resistant, leak resistant, break
resistant, as well as be tamper resistant after being
closed and tamper evident if opened. The use of non-toxic
materials and incineratable materials is important because
some receptacles are incinerated and/or disposed of at 
disposal sites. Also, for use in doctor's offices the
receptacles may need to be autoclavable.US Patent Specification No 5,014,874 discloses a
base having a disposable receptacle and a reusable cover
resembling a box with an open bottom. The resuable cover
has a shuttle which conceals access to the receptacle but
which allows an item to be disposed of, to be transferred
into the receptacle.The problem with this arrangement is that
removal of the cover provides open access to the contents
of the receptacle which is undesirable where used syringes
are concerned. Furthermore, there is only a single access
path to the receptacle from the cover.It is an object of the invention to provide an
improved apparatus for holding and disposing of syringes.According to the present invention there is
provided an apparatus for holding and disposing of
syringes, comprising a disposable receptacle, a reusable
cover generally resembling a box with an open bottom, said
cover being configured to fit
