<ABSTRACT>
An oscilloscope of the following type is 
disclosed. Even though a main unit (A) of the oscilloscope 

is horizontally placed, a display (B) can be adjusted at an 
optimal angle. Also, while the main unit remains in 

such a position, press buttons can be depressed stably. 
An operating section (20) is covered in the case of carrying 

the oscilloscope and knobs (9) of the operating section, and 
the like, can be kept out of the way, thereby not 

hampering portability. An oscilloscope casing is 
divided into a display section and an operating section. 

A part of the top surface of the main unit is lowered 
and the operating section is placed on the lowered 

surface. The display section doubles as a cover for the 
operating section and is pivotally fixed to the top 

surface of the main unit via a hinge (19) so as to freely 
open and close. The display section (B) has a display 

screen (4) inside and forms the top surface of the main unit 
and covers the operating section outside when the 

display section is closed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a portable 
oscilloscope casing structure and to a digital color 
oscilloscope which is improved in operational 
performance. Conventionally, in addition to a typically-shaped 
portable oscilloscope, a further downsized 
oscilloscope is available such that it is actuated by a 
battery and employs a plane-type display, such as a 
liquid crystal display. Figs. 15 and 16 show one example of a portable 
digital oscilloscope using such a plane-type display. 
Fig. 15 is a plan view of such an oscilloscope. Fig. 16 
is a side view of the oscilloscope in its standing 
position. As is seen from Figs. 15 and 16, the 
conventional digital oscilloscope is characterized in 
that an operating surface 17 and a display surface 15 
are integrally formed with each other on the same plane. 
A viewing angle adjustment mechanism for observing the 
display surface 15 is constructed in such a way that a 
stand 16 arranged at the rear of the main unit is used 
to raise and support a bottom 14 of the main unit. The  
 
adjustment range of the stand 16 is from one to two 
steps. Accordingly, the stand 16 is used to tilt the 
operating surface 15. In order to make the surface of 
the oscilloscope casing as even as possible for 
achieving easy carrying, press button switches and 
volumes are largely used for the operating system. However, the conventional oscilloscope 
described above presents the following first problem. 
It has a narrow adjustment range for obtaining an 
optimal angle to observe the display surface. The 
operator has to take the trouble to move his/her own 
viewpoint in order to obtain an optimal viewing angle. 
Besides, while the oscilloscope is tilted, the main unit 
is unstable so that it is likely to be moved by the 
depression of a button. The press buttons are largely 
used so that it is particularly difficult to make fine 
adjustments with fingers for adjusting the position of a 
waveform, or the like. The use of turning knobs might 
solve such a problem, but at the same time, it would 
produce protrusions on the operating surface, which 
might be inconvenient in the way of carrying the 
oscilloscope. In terms of operational performance, there has 
been suggested the following techniques of 
differentiating the channels in the conventional multichannel 
input digital color oscilloscope: colors of the 
display waveforms are determined corresponding to the  
 
channels; the probe tips and the connecting portions 
between the probes and the oscilloscope are marked in 
various
