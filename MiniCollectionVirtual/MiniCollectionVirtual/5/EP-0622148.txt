<ABSTRACT>
Method of regulating the current for the electric resistance seam welding (3, 4) of two metal sheets (5, 6) with overlap of their edges, of the type including a welding transformer (1) of which the primary circuit includes a primary-current control device (2), a secondary-current sensor (9), formed by a magnetoresistive probe, and an electronic device (15) for calculating the optimum welding current, the said optimum welding current being determined as a function of the thickness and of the electrical resistivity of each of the two metal sheets (5, 6), characterised in that the said secondary-current sensor (9) is arranged in the immediate proximity of the welding members (3, 4), the optimum welding current is expressed in the form of an optimum equivalent primary welding current, the current measured by the said secondary-current sensor (9) is converted into an effective equivalent primary welding current and the said effective primary welding current is compared with the said optimum primary welding current, the error signal acting on the said primary-current control device (2).
