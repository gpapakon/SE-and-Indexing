<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a cutting insert for a face milling tool. The tool
comprises a milling body intended to be rotated in a milling machine. The milling

body comprises a number of seats for receiving tetragonal, pentagonal or
hexagonal cutting inserts (11). The cutting insert comprises two, essentially

parallel, side faces as well as them uniting edge surfaces and comprises a number
of cutting edge pairs which are formed at the transition of a side face and a edge

surface of the cutting insert. The side face constitutes a chip surface and the edge
surface constitutes a clearance surface. Each cutting edge pair consists of a major

cutting edge (15) and a minor cutting edge (16), which meet in the area of a cutting
corner (17), which corner has a bisector (B). The minor cutting edge is provided to

generate a surface on a work piece (40). Associated major (15) and minor(16)
cutting edges are provided at one and the same side of the bisector (B). Two minor

cutting edges connect to each other at or in the vicinity of the bisector (B), said
minor cutting edges (16) being arranged substantially perpendicular to the axis of

rotation of the face milling tool. The minor cutting edge (16) is sharper than the
major cutting edge (15) by connecting the major cutting edge to a first concave chip

forming surface in the chip surface via a chip-upsetting surface while the minor
cutting edge directly connects to a second concave chip forming surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cutting insert for face milling as described in the
preamble of claim 1 (see for example GB 951 624).Through UK 951 624 is previously known a tool and a cutting insert substantially of
the above-captioned type, wherein the tool is provided such that all cutting edges in
the active corner portion of the cutting insert comes into engagement with the work
piece during the machining operation. This means that all cutting edges in the
corner portion are worn simultaneously and therefore for example a tetragonal
cutting insert at most can be indexed to 8 positions with new cutting edges. US-A-4,616,962
discloses a milling insert with four cutting edges.One object of the present invention is to provide a cutting insert for face milling,
wherein at least 16 new cutting edges can be utilized.Another object of the present invention is to provide a cutting insert for face milling,
with many cutting edges which makes utilization economically advantageous.Still another object of the present invention is to provide an easy working cutting
insert for chip removal.Still another object of the present invention is to provide a cutting insert according
to an alternative embodiment which is developed for bringing the chip to deflect in a
direction which entails little contact surface and subsequently a low coefficient of
friction between the chip and the cutting insert.These and other objects have been achieved by a cutting insert for face milling
according to the subsequent claims with reference to the enclosed drawings. Fig. 1 shows a tetragonal cutting insert according to the present invention in a
plane view. Fig. 2 shows the cutting insert in a side view. Fig. 3A shows the cutting
insert in a cross-section according to line III-III in Fig. 1 and Fig. 3B shows an
enlarged cross-section of a cutting corner in Fig. 3A. Fig. 4 shows the cutting insert
in a cross-section according to line IV-IV in Fig. 1. Fig. 5 shows an alternative
embodiment of a tetragonal cutting insert according to the present invention in a
plane view. Fig. 6 shows the alternative cutting insert in a side view. Fig. 7 shows
the alternative cutting insert in a cross-section according to line VII-VII in Fig. 5. Fig.
8 shows a tool in a side view. Figs. 9 and 10 show magnifications of the tool's
active corner for the two alternatives, as seen towards the plane of the active side
faces of the cutting insert. Fig. 11 shows an additional embodiment of a cutting
insert according to the present invention in a plane

<CLAIMS>
Cutting insert for face milling, wherein the cutting insert has a tetragonal,
pentagonal or hexagonal basic form, said cutting insert (11;11';11") comprising two,

essentially parallel, side faces (12,13;12',13') as well as them uniting edge surfaces
(14A-14D;14A'-14D') and comprising a number of cutting edge pairs which are

formed at the transition between a side face (12,13;12',13') and an edge surface
(14A-14D;14A'-14D') of the cutting insert, said side face constituting a chip surface

and said edge surface constituting a clearance surface, each said cutting edge
pairs comprising a major cutting edge (15;15') and a minor cutting edge (16;16'),

which meet in the area of a cutting corner (17;17'), which corner has a bisector
(B;B'), said minor cutting edge being provided to generate a surface on a work

piece (40), wherein

the associated major cutting edge (15;15') and minor
cutting edge (16;16') are provided at one and the same side of the bisector (B;B')

and that two minor cutting edges connect to each other at or in the vicinity of the
bisector (B;B') and that to each other connecting minor cutting edges (16;16') form

a blunt inner angle (ε;ε') 
characterized in that
 the minor cutting edge (16;16') is sharper than
the major cutting edge (15;15') by connecting the major cutting edge to a first

concave chip forming surface (20;20') in the chip surface via a chip-upsetting
surface (19;19') while the minor cutting edge directly connects to a second concave

chip forming surface (21;21').
Cutting insert according to claim 1,
characterized in that
 the cutting insert (11;11') comprises at least 16
cutting edge pairs and 
in that
 the associated major cutting edge (15;15') and minor
cutting edge (16;16') form a first acute external angle (α;α') with each other, said
