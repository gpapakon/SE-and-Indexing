 TITLEMULTI-PLATE LAMINATION FIXTUREBACKGROUND OF THE INVENΗONField of the Invention The present invention relates to a lamination fixture for use prior to firing multilayered ceramic materials.Description of the Prior Art Presently, multilayered ceramic materials are laminated between a pressing die formed from a pair of superimposed parallel die plates. The plates are received within a press and pressure is applied to bond the ceramic materials. The throughput of such a system is limited.It is therefore believed advantageous to provide a fixture arrangement whereby the lamination throughput of multilayered ceramic materials may be increased.SUMMARY OF THE INVENΗONThe present invention relates to a single lamination plate and to a fixture formed from a plurality of such lamination plates for use in laminating an unfired ceramic multilayered material.A lamination plate in accordance with one aspect of the present invention has a first surface and a second surface thereon, with at least a portion of the perimeter of the lamination plate being generally linear. A keyway is formed in the first surface of the plate along the linear portion of the perimeter thereof, with a key being mounted to the plate in the keyway. A portion of the key protrudes past the second 

 surface of the plate. The lamination plate has a recess extending a predetermined distance into the lamination plate from one surface thereof and a positioning pin projecting above the other surface of the lamination plate for a distance less than the predetermined distance.In accordance with another aspect of the invention a lamination fixture for use in laminating an unfired ceramic multilayered material includes a top lamination plate, at least one intermediate lamination plate, and a bottom lamination plate. Each lamination plate has a first and a second surface thereon, with at least a portion of the perimeter of each lamination plate being generally linear, each lamination plate having a keyway formed in the generally linear portion of the perimeter thereof. The top and the intermediate lamination plates each having a key mounted in the keyway thereof. Each key has a first edge and a second edge thereon, with each key being arranged in the keyway with respect to the surfaces of the lamination plate to which it is mounted such that the first edge of the key is offset below the first surface of the lamination plate and the second edge of the key protrudes past the second surface of the plate. The plates defining the fixture are stackable

<CLAIMS>
WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. A lamination plate for use in laminating an unfired ceramic multilayered material, the lamination plate having a first surface and a second surface, at least a portion of the perimeter of the lamination plate being generally linear, wherein the improvement comprises: a keyway formed in the first surface of the plate along the linear portion of the perimeter thereof; a key mounted to the plate in the keyway thereon, a portion of the key protruding past the second surface of the plate.
2. The lamination plate of claim 1 further comprising: a recess extending a predetermined distance into the lamination plate from one surface thereof; and, a positioning pin projecting above the other surface of the lamination plate for a distance less than the predetermined distance.
3. A lamination fixture for use in laminating an unfired ceramic multilayered material, the fixture comprising:
a top lamination plate, at least one intermediate lamination plate, and a bottom lamination plate, each lamination plate having a first and a second surface thereon, at least a portion of the perimeter of each lamination plate being generally linear, each lamination plate having a keyway formed in the generally linear portion of the perimeter thereof,
the top and the intermediate lamination plates each having a key mounted in the keyway thereof, each key having a first edge and a second edge thereon, each key being arranged in the keyway with respect to the surfaces of the lamination plate to which it is mounted such that the first edge 


of the key is offset below the first surface of the lamination plate and the second edge of the key protrudes past the second surface of the plate,
the plates being stackable such that the protruding second edge of the key on the top and intermediate lamination plates respectively extends into the keyway on the intermediate and bottom lamination plates.
4. The lamination fixture of claim 3 further comprising: a recess extending a predetermined distance into the second surface of the top and the intermediate lamination plates; and, a positioning pin projecting above the first surface of the intermediate and the bottom lamination plates each for a distance less than the predetermined distance, when stacked, the positioning pin projecting above the first surface of the intermediate and the bottom lamination plates respectively extending into the recess in the second surface of the top and the intermediate lamination plates.
