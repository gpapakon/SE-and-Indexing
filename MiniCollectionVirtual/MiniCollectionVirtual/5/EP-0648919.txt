<ABSTRACT>
In the process, the untreated gas flowing out of the pressurised combustion chamber is, if the temperature is above the ash fusion temperature, first of all cooled to below the ash fusion point but above the gas-turbine inlet temperature by means of recirculated exhaust gas and/or air and/or oxygen, is then cooled further with heat being released to the clean gas and by the addition of recirculated exhaust gas and/or air and/or oxygen to about 650-950 DEG C, purified of dust including alkali metal compounds, SO2 and NOx by known methods at this temperature, heated up again as clean gas to the permissible gas-turbine inlet temperature by absorption of heat from the untreated gas, and then flows through a gas turbine and subsequently a waste-heat steam generator in which water for the operation of a steam turbine comprising one or more pressure stages is preheated, evaporated and superheated. The process is distinguished by particularly high efficiencies for the power generators.

Method for generating gases to run a gas turbine (36) in a combined gas and
steam turbine power station, in which fine grained to pulverant coal is

combusted at a pressure of 
>
 1 bar and a temperature of
