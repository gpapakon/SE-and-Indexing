<ABSTRACT>
The method in which is 
capable of detecting the remainder of tape a tape cassette in 

multiple stages in a short time by a simple 
calculation involves only a simple multiplication and uses 

simple comparison equations derived without measuring the tape 
thickness and the total tape running time. The method 

includes the steps of deriving a take-up reel cycle (T
t
), a 
supply reel cycle (T
s
) and a constant (A) for each operation 
mode (A = 2πR₀/V), indicating an information that the 

remainder of the tape wound on a supply reel hub corresponds 
to the n-th one of n stages when the sum (T
s
 + A) is more than 
a predetermined value while indicating an information that the 

remainder of the tape wound on a take-up reel hub corresponds 
to the first stage when the sum (T
s
 + A) is not more than the 
predetermined value, but when the sum (T
t
 + A) is more than 
the predetermined value, setting a stage value of m (1 
<
 m 
<
 
n) when the sum (T
t
 + A) is not more than the predetermined 
value, substituting the stage value (m) by "m + 1", 

determining whether t

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for detecting 
the remainder of a tape, and more particularly to a method for 
detecting the remainder of tape of a tape cassette, capable of 
displaying the remainder of tape in the form of a multiple 
stage in a short time by a simple calculation using the ratio 
between the remainder time of tape wound on a take-up reel of 
the tape cassette and the remainder time of tape wound on a 
supply reel of the tape cassette. Generally, tape cassettes for VCR of VHS system have 
different hub radii depending on the kind thereof. However, 
tape cassettes for VCR of 8mm system have a constant hub 
radius irrespective of the kind thereof. Referring to FIG. 1, there is illustrated a cassette deck 
employed in a conventional recording and reproducing 
apparatus. As shown in FIG. 1, the cassette deck which is 
denoted by the reference numeral 1 includes a light emitting 
element (not shown). When a tape cassette is loaded in the 
deck 1, the light emitting element is positioned at the center  
 
of the top-end light emitting display (LED) hole T-EH of the 
tape cassette 4. A pair of light receiving elements 3 are 
disposed at upper ends of both side walls of the cassette deck 
1, respectively, to receive light emitted from the light 
emitting element via a tape T of the tape cassette 4. A drum 
2 is disposed at the rear portion of the cassette deck 1 so as 
to reproduce data recorded on the tape T and record data on 
the tape T. When the tape T runs for recording data thereon or 
reproducing data therefrom, the light emitting element 
positioned at the top-end LED hole T-EH emits light. The 
light is projected toward both the light receiving elements 3. Where a portion of the tape T not coated with an opaque 
magnetic film is positioned between the light emitting element 
and an optional one of the light receiving elements 3, the 
light projected toward the light receiving element 3 is 
allowed to be incident on the light receiving element 3. As 
the tape T further runs, a portion of the tape T coated with 
the opaque magnetic film is positioned between the light 
emitting element and the light receiving element 3. At this 
time, the light emitted from the light emitting element is 
shielded by the opaque portion of tape T, thereby disabling 
the light to be incident on the light receiving element 3. In 
such a manner, the leading point of the portion of tape T 
coated with the magnetic film is recognized.  When the portion of tape T not coated with the magnetic 
film is

A method for detecting the remainder of a tape of a 
tape cassette, comprising the steps of: 


(A) deriving a take-up reel cycle (Tt), a supply reel 
cycle (TS) and a constant (A) for each operation mode (A = 

2πR₀/V); 
(B) indicating an information that the remainder of the 
tape wound on a supply reel hub corresponds to the n-th one of 

n stages when the sum (TS + A) of the supply reel cycle (TS)

indicating an information that the remainder of the tape wound 
on a take-up reel hub corresponds to the first stage when the 

sum (TS + A) is not more than the predetermined value, but

constant (A) is more than the predetermined value; 
(C) setting a stage value of m higher than one and lower 
than n to be one when the sum (Tt + A) is not more than the 

predetermined value; 
(D) substituting the stage value (m) by a value of m + 1; 
(E) determining whether or not the product of a running 
time (tS) of the tape wound on the supply reel hub by a 

predetermined value ((n - m) + 1) is not less than the product 
of a running time (tt) of the tape wound on the take-up reel 

hub by a predetermined value (m - 1); and

determination of tS·{(n-m)+1} ≧ tt·(m-1) has been made at the
