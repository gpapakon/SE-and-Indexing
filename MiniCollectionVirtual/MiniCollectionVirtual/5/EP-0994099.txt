<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel
processes for preparing intermediates
(particularly 4-cyano-3-nitrobenzotrifluoride)
useful in the preparation of pesticides.Pesticidal 4-benzoylisoxazoles, particularly
5-cyclopropylisoxazole herbicides and
intermediate compounds in their synthesis, are
described in the literature, for example in
European Patent Publication Nos. 0418175,
0487353, 0527036, 0560482, 0609798 and 0682659
and US patent 4886936.Various methods for preparing these
compounds are known. The present invention seeks
to provide improved methods for the preparation
of pesticides and the intermediate compounds
useful in preparing them.It is therefore an object of the present
invention to provide novel and more economical
processes for the preparation of ortho-nitrobenzonitrile
compounds.It is a further object of the present
invention to provide processes for the
preparation of ortho-nitrobenzonitrile compounds
which proceed in high yield and/or with high
selectivity.It is a further object of the present
invention to provide a process for the
preparation of ortho-nitrobenzonitrile compounds
which requires a low amount of copper compound
as catalyst.It is a further object of the present
invention to provide a process for the
preparation of ortho-nitrobenzonitrile compounds
which proceeds using cuprous cyanide without the
need for a catalyst. It is a further object of the present
invention to provide a process for the
preparation of ortho-nitrobenzonitrile compounds
which proceeds at a lower temperature than known
methods and is therefore easier to perform.The present invention allows these objects
to be met in whole or in part.The present invention accordingly provides a
process for the preparation of an ortho-nitrobenzonitrile
compound of formula (I):

   wherein:
R1 represents trifluoromethyl;and R2 represents hydrogen; which process
comprises the reaction of the corresponding
ortho-nitrobromobenzene of formula (II):

   wherein R1 and R2 are as hereinbefore
defined, with: 
(b) an alkali metal cyanide in the presence
of a catalytic amount of cuprous cyanide and
a phase transfer catalyst.Certain compounds of formula (I) are known
and a number of processes for their preparation
and conversion into herbicidal
4-benzoylisoxazole derivatives have been
described in the European Patent Applications
cited above.Compounds of formula (II) are known or may
be prepared by known methods.In formulae (I) and (II) and in the formulae
depicted hereinafter, preferred values of the
symbols are as follows:-R1 represents
