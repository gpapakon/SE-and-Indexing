<ABSTRACT>
Oil-soluble additives with dispersant properties inert towards 
fluoroelastomers are described, prepared by reacting an alkyl or 

alkenyl disuccinimide with an anhydride of an unsaturated 
bicarboxylic aliphatic acid or the corresponding acid. The 

reaction is conducted at a temperature of between 130 and 170°C. 
The molar ratio of anhydride to disuccinimide is between 1.05 and 

1.95.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process able to render disuccinimides
of dispersant action contained in lubricating oils compatible with
the fluorinated elastomer gaskets used in internal combustion
engines and industrial machines.Fluorinated elastomers are commonly used as gaskets in internal
combustion engines, in particular to prevent lubricant leakage at
those points where moving parts, such as the crankshaft, are in
contact with the engine.In this respect, fluorinated elastomers possess a virtually unique
combination of excellent thermal stability and resistance to
various types of fluid. Such fluorinated gaskets can however be
attacked, under engine operating conditions, by nitrogenated
components contained in lubricating oils, in particular by amines
of basic character.In this respect it seems certain that said attack consists of the
base-catalyzed elimination of hydrofluoric acid, with the
consequent formation of unsaturations. With regard to its
mechanical properties, the thus deteriorated fluoroelastomer loses
elasticity and elongation, until it no longer possesses sealing 
capacity.Of the nitrogenated components normally used in lubricants,
disuccinimides with dispersant action have proved particularly
critical towards fluorinated elastomers, either when used alone or
in combination with viscosity index improvement polymers of
dispersant action containing nitrogenated monomers. In this
respect, both these classes of additive contain strongly basic
amino groups (primary and/or secondary and/or tertiary).The patent literature describes various processes which can be
used to overcome the aforesaid drawback.For example, US-A-3,422,017 describes products of the reaction
between primary, secondary or tertiary amines and fluorophosphoric
acid.US-A-4,379,064 teaches mild oxidation of nitrogenated dispersants
to make the dispersant unreactive towards fluoroelastomers.US-A-4,615,826 describes an oil-soluble adduct prepared by
reacting a succinimide having at least one basic nitrogen with
fluorophosphoric acid or its ammonium salt.US-A-5,080,815 describes dispersants compatible with
fluoroelastomers prepared by reacting alkyl anhydrides (or
relative bicarboxylic acids), the alkyl group having from 20 to
250 carbon atoms, with aminoguanidine (or relative salts).EP-A-0 136 185 describes a dispersant modified with boron.All these process, and the relative products, have various
drawbacks.In this respect, US-A-3,422,017 and US-A-4,615,826 use a reagent,
namely fluorophosphoric acid, which gives rise to ash and
