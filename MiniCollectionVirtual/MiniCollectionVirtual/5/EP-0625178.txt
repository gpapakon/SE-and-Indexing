<ABSTRACT>
There are provided improved processes for the manufacture of enriched pitches, carbon fiber precursors, carbon fibers, and graphite fibers. The improvement comprises employing an elevated wiped-film evaporator (105) in a wiped-film evaporator system comprising the wiped-film evaporator (105) and a means for recovering enriched pitch (119), such as a positive displacement pump (119), to form an enriched pitch from catalytic pitch and regulating the operating conditions of the wiped-film evaporator system to provide the desired enriched pitch. The wiped-film evaporator (105) is located a specific distance above the means for recovering enriched pitch (119). The vertical distance between the outlet of the wiped-film evaporator (105) and the inlet of the means for recovering enriched pitch (119) is within the range of about 3 to about 15 meters, preferably about 6 to about 15 meters. Preferably the wiped-film evaporator (105) is heated with Dow Chemical Syltherm heat transfer media or its derivatives or equivalents.

<DESCRIPTION>
Petroleum pitches are recognized as suitable 
sources of carbon and, if having the proper softening 
point, can be used satisfactorily as an impregnation 
material for electrodes, anodes, and carbon-carbon 
composites, e.g., carbon-carbon fiber composites, such as 
aircraft brakes and rocket engine nozzles. The pitches 
can be used in the nuclear industry for the preparation 
of fuel sticks for a graphite moderated reactor. 
Furthermore, such pitches can be used in the production 
of carbon fiber precursors, carbon fibers, and graphite 
fibers. Carbon and graphite fibers provide a high 
strength per weight ratio. Such property enables them 
and composites made from them to be used in sporting 
equipment, automobile parts, light-weight aircraft, and 
increasing aerospace applications. While various different carbonaceous materials 
(sometimes called fiber precursors) have been disclosed 
in the prior art for the manufacture of carbon or 
graphite fibers, two significant commercial processes 
employ polyacrylonitrile or mesophase pitch to produce 
high-strength graphite fibers. However, such processes 
have disadvantages. For example, the preparation or 
mesophase pitch requires that the initial feedstock be 
heated to an elevated temperature for a number of hours. 
as shown by Lewis, et al., in US-A-3,976,729, by 
singer, in US-A-4,00,183, and by Schulz, in  
 
US-A-4,014,725. Therefore, such a process is time consuming and costly. In 
addition, care must be taken in heating for a specific time, since mesophase pitch 
can increase in viscosity rapidly, making it unsuitable for spinning. On the other 
hand, polyacrylonitrile is a relatively expensive feedstock, equalizing the overall 
cost of producing fibers from polyacrylonitrile with the cost of producing carbon 
or graphite fibers from mesophase pitch. Recently, Sawran, et al., in US-A-4,497,789, have disclosed 
a process for producing substantially non-mesophasic pitch and a method for 
producing carbon fibers therefrom. Now an improved process for the manufacture of pitches having 
relatively high softening points has been developed. In addition, an improved 
process for making carbon fiber precursors, as well as carbon fibers, has been 
developed. In these improved processes, an elevated wiped-film evaporator is 
employed. According to the invention, there is provided a process for the 
production of an enriched pitch from a petroleum pitch, which process comprises 
treating said petroleum pitch in a system comprising a wiped-film evaporator and
