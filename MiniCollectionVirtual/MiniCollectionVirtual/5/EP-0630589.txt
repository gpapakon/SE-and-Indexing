<ABSTRACT>
Crash helmet for cyclists and for non-motor sports in 
general, comprising a first protection cap of expanded 

polystyrene and a second reinforcement cap of transparent 
rigid plastic material, such as polycarbonate, 

whose surface is provided with a metallized layer 
capable of lending different colours according to the 

depth of the layer and the type of metal used, giving 
in this way a special aesthetic quality to the helmet, 

while keeping unchanged the protection characteristics 
of said helmet.

<DESCRIPTION>
Object of this invention is a crash-helmet for cyclists 
and non-motor sports in general, comprising a first cap 
of expanded polystyrene and a second cap of rigid 
plastic material such as polycarbonate, fitted on said 
first polystirene cap and provided, on its surface, 
with a metallized layer suitable to lend special aesthetic 
qualities, while keeping unchanged the protection 
characteristics of said helmet. As known, the main function of crash-helmets for cyclists 
and for sportspeople who practice sports involving 
danger of damages due to falls, accidental hittings 
and the like, is to develop an effective protection 
activity of the user head, and in particular of 
the skull; such helmets, which usually are cap-shaped, 
are also provided with holes or slits to let the ventilation 
air enter and circulate, as well as with fasteninig 
means, such as thongs or chin-straps, opportunely 
fixed to the cap. A helmet of the above mentioned type is described in 
the Patent Application EP 93105996.8 in the name of the 
same Applicant, and is constituted by the association 
between a first protection cap of expanded polystyrene 
or the like, and a second reinforcement cap of rigid 
plastic material such as polycarbonate, whose shape and 
size allow it to fit on to the polystyrene cap and to 
offer a high mechanical resistance to shocks as well as  
 
a remarkable lightness, so granting to the helmet high 
mechanical resistance to shocks besides good characteristics 
of easy handiness and lightness. The polycarbonate utilized to manufacture the external 
helmet cap according to the necessary requirements of 
shock resistance, is transparent; the transparency of 
this material stresses any imperfections that might be 
present on the first cap of expanded polystyrene, and 
does not permit to mask the fastening elements of the 
chin-straps nor the grooves, slits and the like, that 
are indispensable for a correct ventilation of the 
helmet. All this leads to a poorly satisfactory global aesthetic 
effect, inasmuch said protection helmets, while 
having to satisfy in the first place the safety requirements 
of the user, are also used by a various and not 
necessarily specialistic public and should therefore 
satisfy the requirements of a pleasant presentation and 
be characterized by a good aesthetic quality. Object of this invention is therefore the realization 
of a crash-helmet for cyclists and sports-activity in 
general, constituted by a first protection cap of 
expanded polystyrene, and by a second
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Crash-helmet for cyclists and sportspeople in general, 
of the type constituted by a first protection cap 

of expanded polystyrene and a second reinforcement cap 
of polycarbonate, whose shape and size are such as to 

permit its fitting on said first protection cap, characterized 
in that said second polycarbonate cap is 

provided with a metallized layer suitable to lend 
particular aesthetic qualities, while keeping unchanged 

the characteristics of shock resistance ensured to said 
helmet by said second cap. 
Crash-helmet for cyclists and sports-activities in 
general according to claim 1, characterized in that 

said second metallized layer is realized on a surface 
of transparent polycarbonate and permits to obtain 

colors even changing, of different intensity and shade 
according to the type of metal utilized and the thickness 

of said layer. 
Crash-helmet for cyclists and sports-activity in 
general according to claim 1, characterized in that 

said metallized layer hides any possible imperfections 
that may be present on said first polystyrene protection 

cap, as well as the fastening elements of the 
chin-straps and other unaesthetic elements present on 

said first cap. 
Crash-helmet for cyclists and sports-activities in 
general according to claim 1, characterized in that 

said metallized layer is realized on both the external 
and internal surfaces of said second polycarbonate cap. 
Crash-helmet for cyclists and sports-activity in 
general according to claim 1, characterized in that 

said metallized layer is realized on the whole internal 
surface of said second polycarbonate cap. 
Crash-helmet for cyclists and sports-activities in 
general according to claim 1, characterized in that 

said metallized layer is realized on the whole external 
surface of said second polycarbonate cap. 
Crash-helmet for cyclists and sports-activities in 
general according to claim 1, characterized in that 

said metallized layer is realized in such a way as to 
keep the transparence in some zones of said cap, leaving 

in this way visible inscriptions, patterns and 
various decorations, applied either on the external 

surface of said first polystyrene cap or on the internal 
surface of said second polycarbonate cap. 
Crash-helmet for cyclists and sports-activities in 
general according to claim 1, characterized in that 

said metallized layer is realized by means of a first 
 

treatment of said policarbonate reinforcement cap with 
an "antiscratch" agent and a following metallization 

treatment, obtaning in this manner a metallized layer 
stable with time and resistant to wheathering.
