<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed are devices for analyzing a fluid cell containing sample. The devices comprise a solid substrate (14), microfabricated to define at least one sample inlet port (16A) and a mesoscale flow system (20). The mesoscale flow system (20) includes a sample flow channel (20), extending from the inlet port, and a cell handling region for treating cells disposed in fluid communication with the flow channel. The devices may further include means for inducing flow of cells in the sample through the flow system. In one embodiment, the cell-handling region (22) may comprise a cell lysis means (24) to enable the lysis of cells in the sample, prior to, e.g., the detection of an intracellular component in the cell sample. In another embodiment, the cell handling region may comprise a cell capture region, comprising binding sites which reversibly bind to a specific population of cells in the cell sample, to permit the isolation of the specific cell population from the sample. The devices can be utilized in a wide range of automated sensitive and rapid tests for the analysis of a fluid cell containing sample.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to apparatus for conducting analyses. More particularly, the invention relates to the design and construction of small, typically single-use, modules capable of analyzing a fluid sample.In recent decades the art has developed a very large number of protocols, test kits, and cartridges for conducting analyses on biological samples for various diagnostic and monitoring purposes. Immunoassays, agglutination assays, and analyses based on polymerase chain reaction, various ligand-receptor interactions, and differential migration of species in a complex sample all have been used to determine the presence or concentration of various biological compounds or contaminants, or the presence of particular cell types.Recently, small, disposable devices have been developed for handling biological samples and for conducting certain clinical tests. Shoji et al. reported the use of a miniature blood gas analyzer fabricated on a silicon wafer. Shoji et al., Sensors and Actuators, 15:101-107 (1988). Sato et al. reported a cell fusion technique using micromechanical silicon devices. Sato et al., Sensors and Actuators, A21-A23:948-953 (1990). Ciba Corning Diagnostics Corp. (USA) has manufactured a microprocessor-controlled laser photometer for detecting blood clotting.Micromachining technology originated in the microelectronics industry. Angell et al., Scientific American,248:44-55 (1983). Micromachining technology has enabled the manufacture of microengineered devices having structural elements with minimal dimensions ranging from tens of microns (the dimensions of biological cells) to nanometers (the dimensions of some biological macromolecules). This scale is referred to herein as "mesoscale". Most experiments involving mesoscale structures have involved studies of micromechanics, i.e., mechanical motion and flow properties. The potential capability of mesoscale structures has not been exploited fully in the life sciences.Brunette (Exper. Cell Res., 167:203-217 (1986) and 164:11-26 (1986)) studied the behavior of fibroblasts and epithelial cells in grooves in silicon, titanium-coated polymers and the like. McCartney et al. (CancerRes., 41:3046-3051 (1981)) examined the behavior of tumor cells in grooved plastic substrates. LaCelle (Blood Cells, 12:179-189 (1986)) studied leukocyte and erythrocyte flow in microcapillaries to gain insight into microcirculation. Hung and Weissman reported a study of fluid dynamics in micromachined channels, but did not produce data associated with an analytic
