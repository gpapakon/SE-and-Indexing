<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the skeletal isomerisation of n-olefins containing from 4 to 20 carbon atoms, which consists in bringing a feedstock containing olefins into contact with a catalyst prepared from a material based on alumina which is treated with a polyorganosiloxane and which is then subjected to a heat treatment. The amount of silica introduced is generally between 0.05 and 15% by weight.
