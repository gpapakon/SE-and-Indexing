<ABSTRACT>
A multiplier calculates a product S'(x) = 
S(x)·λ(x) mod X
d-1
 of a syndrome polynomial S(x) 
generated by a syndrome generator and an erasure 

position polynomial λ(x) generated by an erasure 
position polynomial generator, modulo X
d-1
. A constant 
multiplier sequentially multiplies coefficients of the 

polynomial S'(x) and the erasure position polynomial 
λ(x) with a power of a primitive root α of a code. The 

power exponents in this multiplication are determined 
in unit
s of coefficients. Every time this 
multiplication is executed, an adder sequentially adds 

predetermined combinations of products. A plurality of 
arithmetic and logic operations according to the 

numbers of correctable erasures and errors are 
sequentially executed using the sums. A divisor and 

dividend are selected in accordance with the number of 
erasures included in the code on the basis of the 

plurality of arithmetic and logic operation results. A 
division is executed using the selected divisor and 

dividend. A value at a position, discriminated to be 
an error position, of the code is corrected based on 

the division result, thus performing error correction 
including erasure correction with a simple circuit 

arrangement.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an error
correction method for detecting and correcting data
errors of data storage media such as optical disks,
magnetooptical disks, and the like, data communication
paths in satellite communications, and the like using
error correction codes and, more particularly, to an
error correction method using codes defined on a finite
field such as Reed Solomon codes (to be referred to as
RS codes hereinafter) and an apparatus therefor.In recent years, in order to improve reliability
of various digital systems such as a memory system
using a storage medium (e.g., an optical disk), an
error correction method using error correction codes is
popularly utilized. In particular, as such error
correction codes, RS codes are widely used in optical
disks, magnetooptical disks, satellite communications,
and the like since they have an important feature for
practical applications, i.e., they achieve the lowest
redundancy among codes having the same code length and
correction performance. However, in a conventional method for processing
encoding/decoding of RS codes at high speed, when
erasure correction is not considered, and correction
performance is as small as about 1 to 2, an apparatus
can be relatively easily realized. However, when
erasure is taken into consideration, processing is
considerably complicated as compared to processing
including no erasure correction even when the error
correction performance is small.US Patent 5,170,399 describes a method and apparatus
for correction of errors and erasures using a Reed-Solomon decoder.
The decoder uses a Euclid stack configured to function
as a Euclid divide or a Euclid multiply module. In that
way, the provision of separate Euclid divide and multiply
stacks can be avoided. Therefore, when the decoder
disclosed in the US patent is implemented by means of an
integrated circuit, it can be produced on a smaller area
than if it comprised separate Euclid divide and Euclid
multiply stacks. In that way, the implementation of the
decoder can be made using a die with reduced size, and
so manufacturing yield from a particular wafer of
semiconducting material can be increased. It is, therefore, an objective of the present
invention to provide a decoding method for performing
error correction including erasure correction using a
simple circuit arrangement, and an apparatus therefor.It is another objective of the present invention
to provide a decoding method for performing erasure
correction at high speed by simple processing, and an
apparatus
