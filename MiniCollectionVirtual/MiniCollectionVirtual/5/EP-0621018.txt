<ABSTRACT>
A prosthesis for the replacement of hard tissues of 
human bones and joints, comprises a porous lamination 

component of metal thin sheets, each having a plurality of 
through holes and a thickness of 150 µm or less, and being 

of a metal unharmful to the living body selected from 
titanium alloy, Co-Cr-Mo alloy or Fe-Ni-Cr alloy, the porous 

lamination component being formed such that the sheets are 
laid over one another and are then diffusion-bonded 

therebetween into one body by heating so that the through 
holes communicate with one another in the direction of the 

thickness thereof, especially wherein a single hole formed 
in at least one of a pair of said thin sheets being 

vertically adjacent to each other communicates with a 
plurality of holes formed in the other of the pair in the 

plan view direction of said thin sheets, and the prosthesis 
is entirely or partially composed of the porous lamination 

component. Such prostheses are not required to be replaced 
again, thereby imposing a lesser burden on patients.

<DESCRIPTION>
1. Field of the Invention
The present invention relates to a prosthesis for the
replacement of hard tissues such as human bones or
joints having significantly deteriorated or lost
functions thereof, and more particularly to a
prosthesis having a porous surface structure capable of
allowing bone tissues to penetrate so that the
support/fixture characteristics of the joining section
between the prosthesis and the living tissues can be
enhanced. The present invention also relates to a
method of making such a prosthesis.2. Prior Art
As conventional prostheses having porous surface
structures capable of allowing bone tissues to
penetrate, a plurality of prostheses have been proposed
as follows:
(1) A metallic prosthesis having sintered and adhered
metallic beads on the surface thereof, as disclosed by
USP No 3855638 and USP No 4644942.(2) A metallic prosthesis having compressed metallic
meshes diffusion-bonded onto the surface thereof by
heating at a high temperature, as disclosed by EP No
0178650 and USP No 4660755.(3) A prosthesis having porous metallic sheets secured
mechanically to the surface thereof, as disclosed by GB
No 2142830A.(4) A prosthesis having a porous surface structure
with small through holes made by laser processing, as
disclosed by USP No 4608052. (5) A prosthesis having a cast porous component
secured to the surface thereof, as disclosed by
Japanese Laid-open Patent Application No 3-123546.(6) A metallic prosthesis having a surface structure
with through holes, the shape of which is almost
similar to that of the cancellous bone tissue, as
disclosed by Japanese Laid-open Patent Application No
3-29649.(7) A prosthesis having a porous lamination component
comprising laminated thin sheets, each having through
holes provided by punching or etching and a thickness
of 150 to 500 µm, made by applying a compression load
and heating, or a prosthesis whose surface is partially
or entirely coated with the porous lamination
component, as disclosed by Japanese Laid-open Patent
Application No 3-49766.The above-mentioned prostheses, however, have the
following problems. The prosthesis (1) has a low volume
porosity (the ratio of the volume of the pores to the entire
volume of the porous component thereof); it is generally
said that the typical volume porosity of the above-mentioned
conventional prostheses is about 35%. When this volume
porosity is low, the relative volume of the bone tissue is
small even if the bone tissue completely fills up all pores.
Accordingly, the strength of the bonding between

<CLAIMS>
A prosthesis (S1) for the replacement of hard tissues of
human bones and joints comprising a porous lamination

component of metal thin sheets (1 - 20) each having a
plurality of through holes (1 - 20H11) and a thickness of

150 µm or less, and being unharmful to the living body,

communicate with one another in the direction of the

thickness thereof, wherein the metal being unharmful to
the living body is a titanium alloy, Co-Cr-Mo alloy or

Fe-Ni-Cr alloy, and wherein a single hole (H2) formed in
