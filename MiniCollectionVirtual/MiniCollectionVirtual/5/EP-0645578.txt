<ABSTRACT>
This headlamp comprises a light source, a reflector (20) having a base surface (23) chosen to form, in an axial and horizontal illumination direction ( DELTA ), images of the source in a defined distribution, and a cover lens (30). According to the invention, the cover lens has essentially no deflecting striations and the reflector comprises, over at least a part of its surface, a plurality of zones in which the said base surface (23) is replaced by substitution surfaces (24) whose contour is defined by the projection onto this base surface of a plane network (40) of polygonal zones (41) defined as a function of a predetermined distribution of the light flux. This network of zones is similar to that which would have been obtained if a network of striation zones had been formed on the cover lens, and the differential separation, in a horizontal plane, between the base surface and the substitution surface corresponds to the profile which the similar striation which would have been formed in this case on the cover lens would have.

A headlight, in particular for a motor vehicle, the headlight
comprising:


a light source (10):
a reflector (20) having a base surface (23) that is suitable
for forming a determined distribution of images of the source in a

lighting direction (Δ) that is axial and horizontal ; the reflector
including, over at least a portion of its base surface, an array of

zones of polygonal outline in projection onto a plane perpendicular
to the axial direction (Δ), in which zones the reflecting surface is

offset relative to the base surface so as to obtain a predetermined
distribution of light flux; and
a closure glass (30) that is essentially free of deflecting
stripes so that the configuration of the emitted beam results solely

from said predetermined distribution performed by the reflector;
said headlight being characterized in that in order to obtain a

distribution of light flux that is identical to that which would have
been obtained by stripes formed on the closure glass, said offset

reflecting surfaces are obtained by projecting a plane array (40) of
zones (41) of polygonal outline corresponding to the outline of said

stripes in said axial direction onto the base surface. the
differential offset (δ) in a horizontal plane between the base

surface and the offset surface corresponding to the horizontal
profile of a corresponding stripe in the same plane, in that in at

least some reflector zones, the offset surfaces are based on stripes
whose profile varies continuously going along their length, and in

that said offset surfaces over at least a major portion of the
reflector (42; 43) are contiguous surfaces that are connected to one

another continuously in the horizontal direction along their common
edge.
A headlight according to claim 1, characterized in that the base
surface of the reflector is a surface (23) that is analytically

defined in such a manner as to form images of the source in which all
of the points thereof lie below a predetermined cutoff. 
A method of manufacturing a reflector for a headlight, in
particular for a motor vehicle, the reflector (20) being suitable for

forming images of the source in a determined distribution. and the
projector including a closure glass that is essentially free of

deflecting stripes, the method being characterized in that it
comprises the following steps:


defining a base reflecting surface for the reflector so as to
form images of the source in a base distribution in a lighting

direction (Δ) that is axial and horizontal;
projecting a plane array (40) of volumes (41) of polygonal
outline in said axial direction onto at least a portion of the

reflecting surface so that the differential offset (δ) in a
horizontal plane between the base surface and the offset surface

corresponds to the horizontal profile of the volume in the same
plane, in that in at least some zones, the horizontal profile of the

volume varies continuously between two extreme profiles, and in that
two adjacent zones in the vertical direction present extreme profiles

that are identical in a horizontal plane of transition between said
zones;
making a mold for the reflector by machining as a function of
data defining the base surface and said volumes; and
molding the reflector using said mold.
A method according to claim 3, characterized in that the base
reflecting surface (23) of the reflector is analytically defined in

such a manner as to form images of the source in said axial and
horizontal lighting direction (Δ) in which all of the points lie

below a predetermined cutoff.
