<ABSTRACT>
A powder spray system (10) includes a powder pump with 
a body (16) having a passage (26) which receives pressurized air, 

mixes powder particles therein and conveys the mixture to 
a powder gun for spraying from the gun. The mixing of 

powder particles occurs via generation of a negative 
pressure region (30) within the passage. This negative 

pressure region (30) is created by a venturi (28), which is 
removably received in the body (16), and which has a bellmouth 

shape at both ends (50,52). By providing a bellmouth shape at 
each end (50,52) of the plastic venturi (28), the venturi (28) may be 

used 
during an initial period of powder coating, then removed, 

reversed and relocated in the body for a second period of 
coating. This minimizes the adverse affects of 

consumption or wearing away of the venturi (28) at the upstream 
end, a susceptibility of plastic venturis, and thereby 

doubles the useful life of the venturi.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a powder pump for 
supplying fluidized powder particles to a powder gun of a 
powder coating system. In a typical powder coating system, a powder pump 
supplies fluidized particles to a powder gun, and the gun 
sprays the powder toward an article to be coated. To do 
this, the powder pump includes an air pressure source 
which ejects air at high pressure along a first tube to an 
inlet of a body with a passage formed therethrough. The 
passage has an outlet which in turn connects to a second 
tube which connects to the gun. The passage of the body includes a removable 
venturi. The passage of the body communicates with an 
opening at the upstream end of the venturi, and the 
opening communicates through an inlet tube with a powder 
supply, such as a fluidized bed. As the high pressure air 
moves through the venturi, a negative pressure is created 
in the opening. This draws the powder up the inlet tube 
into the venturi and causes  
 
it to flow through the venturi with the high pressure air, 
through the second tube and to the powder gun. It is 
preferable to use a venturi with a gradually tapered edge, 
referred to as a bellmouth shape. This shape promotes 
smooth and efficient flow. Venturis are usually made of metal, however a 
metal venturi is not suitable for powder coating because, 
the venturi gets heated from the friction of the powder 
passing therethrough, the heat melts the powder, and it 
sticks to the inside surface of the venturi. This narrows 
the diameter of the venturi. To eliminate this problem, plastic materials with 
a lower coefficient of friction are used. Various tests 
have shown a fluoride resin to produce the best results. 
However, when coating requires a powder with white 
cosmetics whose main ingredient is titanium oxide, the 
titanium oxide accelerates consumption of the fluoride 
resin. At typical pressure and flow rates, 350 kg of 
powder passes through the venturi every 30-40 hours, and 
the venturi is rapidly consumed to the extent that it 
cannot be used again. A venturi for use in a powder pump in accordance 
with the invention, the venturi being releasably mounted 
within the body of the powder pump, is characterised in 
that the venturi is formed with a venturi passage 
terminating at each end in a bellmouth having gradually 
tapered edges.  Such a venturi, having a bellmouth shape at each 
end, is reversible. After a certain number of hours of 
use with a first end serving as the upstream end, the 
venturi can be reversed so that a second
