<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus of the present invention can achieve 
an improved image quality, irrespective of either a 

still image or a motion image to be obtained, when a 
scanning line number is converted. To this end, an 

interlaced scanning signal is input to a field delay 
circuit (13) and to a vertical highpass filter (21a), 

the output of the field delay circuit (13) is input to a 
field delay circuit (14) and to a vertical lowpass 

filter (22), and the output of the field delay circuit 
(14) is input to a vertical highpass filter (21b). The 

outputs of the vertical highpass filters (21a, 21b) are 
added together at an adder (24). The output of the 

adder (24) is added by an adder (23) to the output of 
the vertical lowpass filter (22) to create an interpolation 

signal. The interpolation signal and direct-type 
signal, being time-compressed, is coupled to a switch 

(18) where they are alternately selected. In this way, 
it is possible to create progressive scanning signals.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a processing
apparatus for converting a scanning line number of a
television signal.As the technique for converting a scanning line
number of a television signal, a motion adaptive type is
known which prepares two types of interpolation signals,
that is, a motion image-matching interpolation signal
and still image-matching interpolation signal obtained
through intra-field interpolation processing and
inter-field interpolation processing, respectively, and
switchingly selects a scanning line interpolation signal
in accordance with the movement of the image. As such a
document, for example, there is JPN PAT APPLN KOKAI
PUBLICATION 4-3151 available.A scanning line number converting circuit as
described in JPN PAT APPLN KOKAI PUBLICATION 4-3151 will
be explained below with reference with FIG. 1. This
circuit is comprised of a circuit for converting an
interlaced scanning signal to a progressive scanning
signal. The circuit combines an interpolation signal
formed with the use of an input signal and the input
signal per se into a progressive scanning signal having
double the scanning line number of the input signal.
Two interpolation signal forming routes are provided,
one for forming a motion image-matching interpolation
signal and the other for forming a still image-matching 
interpolation signal. In the former route, the motion
image-matching interpolation signal is formed from those
scanning line signals in the same field and, in the
latter route, the still image-matching interpolation
signal is formed from those scanning signals of a
preceding field and/or a following field. By a motion
detecting signal generated at a motion detection
circuit, one of the still image-matching interpolation
signal and motion image-matching interpolation signal is
properly selected in accordance with a still image mode
or motion image mode of the input signal.In FIG. 1, an interlaced scanning signal is
supplied to an input terminal 312. The input signal is
supplied to a field delay circuit 314 and to a
subtracter 319. The output of the field delay circuit
314 is input to a field delay circuit 315, a line delay
circuit 316 giving an amount of delay corresponding to
one horizontal period, adder 317 and time compression
circuit 324. The signal to the time compression circuit
324 is of a direct type.The output of the field delay circuit 315 is input
to the subtracter 319 and coefficient unit 322 and the
output of the coefficient unit 322 is input to an adder
323. The output of the line delay
