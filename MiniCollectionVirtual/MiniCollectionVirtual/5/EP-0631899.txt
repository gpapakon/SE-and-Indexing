<ABSTRACT>
Seat height adjustment mechanism for a car seat, of the type including a telescopic handle 5 able to drive in rotation, through suitable coupling means, a control spindle 8 connected to the raiser of the said seat so that a rotation of the control spindle 8 can, depending on the direction of this rotation, entrain raising or lowering of the said seat part 9. This mechanism is characterised in that the said means for coupling between the said handle 5 and the said control spindle 8 are such that the latter can be driven equally well in both directions only when the said telescopic handle 5 is pulled out, retraction of this handle allowing it, after the said raiser has been adjusted, to be returned to a horizontal position, without driving the said control spindle 8.

<CLAIMS>
Squab height adjustment mechanism for a motor vehicle 
seat, of the type having a telescopic handle (5) able to be 

driven in rotation, by suitable coupling means (17, 21), a 
control shaft (8) connected to the lifting member of the said 

seat so that a rotation of the control shaft (8) can give 
rise, according to the direction of this rotation, to a 

raising or lowering of the said squab (9), characterised in 
that the said coupling means between the said handle (5) and 

the said control shaft (8) are such that the latter can be 
driven equally well in both directions only with the said 

telescopic handle (5) in the extracted position, the 
retraction of this handle enabling it, after adjustment of the 

said lifting member, to be returned into the horizontal 
position, without driving the said control shaft (8). 
Mechanism according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
said coupling means comprise on the one hand a central means 

(17) of driving a head (7) of the said control shaft (8), by 
means of the said handle (5), in a given direction of 

rotation, and on the other hand an eccentric means (21) of 
driving the said head (7) of the said control shaft (8), by 

means of the said handle (5), in the direction of rotation 
opposite to the previous one, acting solely when the said 

telescopic handle (5) is in the extracted position. 
Mechanism according to claim 2, characterised in that the 
said central driving means comprises a housing in the shape of 

an arc of a circle (19) provided in the central part of a 
casing (1) in which the said telescopic handle (5) is able to 

slide, the head (7) of the said control shaft (8) carrying a 
stud (20) able to move in the said housing (19) and which is 

in abutment against one (19') of the said end walls of this 
housing (19) when the said handle (5) is in its initial 

horizontal position, so that the handle can drive the said  
 

control shaft (8), by means of the said stud (20), only in the 
said given direction of rotation. 
Mechanism according to Claim 9 or 3, characterised in that 
the said eccentric driving means comprises a rocker (21) 

pivotally mounted in a casing (1) in which the said telescopic 
handle (5) is able to slide, this rocker (21) being able to be 

released by extraction of the said telescopic handle (5), so 
that one end (23) of this rocker (21) comes into abutment 

against a heel (24) on the head (7) of the said control shaft 
(8) in order to be able to drive the latter in the said 

opposite direction of rotation. 
Mechanism according to Claim 4, characterised in that the 
said rocker (21) is forced by a leaf spring (25) towards the 

position in which its end (23) comes into abutment on the said 
heel (24) on the said head (7) of the control shaft (8). 
Mechanism according to Claim 4 or 5, characterised in that 
the said head (7) of the control shaft (8) has at least two 

angularly offset heels (24, 24'), suitable for cooperating 
with the said end (23) of the rocker (21). 
Mechanism according to Claim 6, characterised in that the 
angular offset of the said two heels (24, 24') is around 70Â°C.
