<ABSTRACT>
A rotating cutting tool with inserts, in particular for metalworking, has for each insert an insert seat (10) which is formed in a tool body (1) and in which the insert (6) resting on a bearing surface (13) is supported laterally in a dimensionally accurate manner in the radial and axial direction. The insert, designed as a perforated plate with a countersunk through-hole (22), is releasably clamped in the insert seat by means of an allocated clamping screw (25) having a clamping head (31) and screwed into a corresponding tapped hole (27) in the tool body or a part connected to the latter. This arrangement is made in such a way that the insert inserted in the insert seat is supported in a dimensionally accurate and positive-locking manner transversely to the hole axis (34) merely in one direction on a stop (17) fixed to the tool body and in the other direction solely by the clamping screw (25).

<CLAIMS>
Rotating cutting tool equipped with inserts (6, 6a), in
particular for metalworking, with a tool body (1) having at

least one seat (10) which is set up to receive an insert and
in which the insert resting on a bearing surface (13) is

laterally supported true to size in the radial and axial
directions, wherein the insert is constructed as a perforated

plate with a countersunk through bore and is releasably
gripped in the seat by means of an associated tightening

screw (25) which has a gripping head (31) and is screwed into
a corresponding threaded bore (27) in the body of the tool or

in a part connected to the latter, characterised in that the
insert (6, 6a) which is inserted into the seat (10) is

supported, in a form-locking manner and true to size,
transversely with respect to the axis of the hole (34) in the

insert in only one direction on a stop (17) fixed on the body
of the tool and in the other direction solely by the

tightening screw (25).
Cutting tool as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in
that the tightening screw is constructed as a fitting screw

(25) with a fitting part (28) which engages with a close
tolerance in a fitting bore (29) in the body of the tool (1)

or of the part connected to the latter, the fitting bore being
coaxial with the threaded bore (27).
Cutting tool as claimed in Claim 2, characterised in
that the axis (33) of the fitting bore (29) is offset relative

to the axis (34) of the hole in the insert (6, 6a) in the
direction of the stop (17) fixed on the body of the tool.
Cutting tool as claimed in one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that in the tightened state of the tightening

screw (25) only the gripping head (31) thereof rests at least
substantially all round on the rim (23) of the opening in the 

perforated plate (6, 6a).
Cutting tool as claimed in one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the insert (6, 6a) is supported only in

the radial direction on a stop (17) fixed on the body of the
tool.
Cutting tool as claimed in one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that, in the case where it is constructed as

a tool which cuts both on the circumference and on the front
face, only the inserts which cut on the front face are axially

supported by their respective tightening screws (25).
