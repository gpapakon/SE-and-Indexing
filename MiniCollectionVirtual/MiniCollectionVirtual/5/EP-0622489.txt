<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a preforming head for ropes and cable armouring, with three preforming discs (2, 3, 4) which are arranged on a shaft in a direction with increasing diameters and of which one preforming disc is arranged fixedly and the other preforming discs displaceably on the shaft. According to the invention, the smallest preforming disc (2) is connected fixedly to the shaft and the other two preforming discs (3, 4) are kinematically coupled to one another in such a way that, during any adjustment of the other two preforming discs (3, 4), the distance (A) between the smallest preforming disc (2) and the medium preforming disc (3) always remains equal to the distance (B) between the medium preforming disc (3) and the largest preforming disc (4).

Preforming head for ropes and cable armouring with three 
preforming discs (2, 3, 4) arranged on a spindle in one direction 

with increasing diameters, whereof the smallest preforming disc 
(2) is arranged in a stationary manner and the other preforming 

discs (3, 4) are arranged to be displaceable on the spindle, 
characterised in that the two displaceable preforming discs (3, 

4) are kinematically connected to each other so that at the time 
of each displacement, the distance (A) between the smallest 

preforming disc (2) and the central preforming disc (3) always 
remains equal to the distance (B) between the central preforming 

disc (3) and the largest preforming disc (4). 
Preforming head according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the displacement of the central preforming disc (3) with 

respect to the connected displacement of the smaller preforming 
disc (2) takes place in a ratio of 1:2. 
Preforming head according to Claim 2, characterised in 
that the spindle is constructed as a tube (1), to one end of 

which the smallest preforming disc (2) is fixed coaxially, that 
arranged parallel to each other in the wall of the tube (1) is 

a rack (8) in a stationary manner and a movable rack (6), the 
central preforming disc (3) being attached to the end of the 

movable rack (6) pointing towards the small preforming disc (2) 
and that engaging respectively in each rack (6, 8) is a gear (11 

or 15), which are mounted on the largest preforming disc (4) and 
which are connected to each other by transmission gearing (17, 

18) and that a drive is provided for one of the gears (11, 15). 
Preforming head according to Claim 3, characterised in 
that the fixed rack (8) is constructed to be sunk in the tube 

wall and the movable rack (6) is guided in a groove (7) in the 
tube (1). 
Preforming head according to Claim 4, characterised in  
 

that the two racks (6 and 8) and the rotary shafts (10 and 16) 
of the meshing gears (11 and 15) are arranged offset by 90Â° with 

respect to each other and the rotary shafts (10 and 16) of the 
gears (11 and 15) each support a bevel gear (17 or 18), which are 

in engagement with each other, the gear (15) meshing with the 
movable rack (6) comprising twice as many teeth as th
e gear (11) 
meshing with the fixed rack (8). 
Preforming body according to Claim 5, characterised in 
that the central preforming disc (3) is arranged to be 

displaceable on a central ring flange (5) rigidly connected to 
the movable rack (6).
