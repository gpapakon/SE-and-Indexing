<ABSTRACT>
Methods are disclosed for producing thrombin. The protein is produced from host cells transformed or transfected with DNA construct(s) containing information necessary to direct the expression of thrombin precursors. The DNA constructs generally include the following operably linked elements: a transcriptional promoter, DNA sequence encoding a gla-domainless prothrombin, and a transcriptional terminator. Thrombin precursors produced from transformed or transfected host cells are activated either in vivo or in vitro.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed generally toward
methods for producing recombinant proteins, and more
specifically, to methods for producing thrombin from host
cells through the use of recombinant DNA techniques.The penultimate step of the coagulation cascade is
the Factor Xa-complex-catalyzed conversion of prothrombin to
thrombin. Prothrombin is a single-chain, vitamin K-dependent
glycoprotein that is synthesized in the liver. Prothrombin
contains a pro peptide, a gla domain, two kringle regions, an
A chain and a serine protease domain. The A chain is
disulfide-linked to the serine protease domain. Conversion to
thrombin requires that prothrombin be cleaved in two places by
Factor Xa-complex. One factor Xa cleavage liberates a protein
fragment comprising the gla domain and two kringle regions.
The other factor Xa cleavage, which is responsible for
producing a catalytically active molecule, cleaves the A chain
from the serine protease domain to form a disulfide-linked two
chain protein. Cleavages at both factor Xa cleavage sites
result in the formation of active thrombin which is composed
of the 49 amino acid A chain disulfide-bonded to the serine
protease domain. Thrombin hydrolyses specific arginyl-glycine
bonds in fibrinogen to produce fibrin monomers, which
self-assemble into a fibrin clot, and in Factor XIII to
produce Factor XIIIa, which in turn cross-links the fibrin
monomers to strengthen and stabilize the fibrin clot. The
role of thrombin in the coagulation cascade has been reviewed,
for example by Jackson and Nemerson (Ann. Rev. Biochem. 49:
765-811 (1980)). Thrombin is used clinically to control bleeding
during surgery, for burns and in certain trauma situations
(Nakamura et al. The Amer. Surgeon 57: 226-230 (1991);
Thompson et al. Ophthalmology 93: 279-282 (1986); Harris et
al., J. Bone Joint surg. [Am] 60: 454-456 (1978); Craig and
Asher, Spine 2: 313-317 (1977); Prasad et al. Burns 17: 70-71
(1991)). Bovine thrombin is also a component of some
commercial tissue glues.Commercial thrombin therapeutics are purified from
pooled human and animal blood products and as such run the
risk of contamination with viruses such as the HIV and
hepatitis viruses. In comparing three commercial thrombin
preparations, Suzuki and Sakuragawa (Thromb. Res. 53:271-278,
1989) found that the preparations contained contaminating
proteins, and the human preparation contained immunoglobulin
G, hepatitis B surface antigen antibodies and human
immunodeficiency antibodies. Xenogeneic immunization with
