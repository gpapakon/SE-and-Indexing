A screwdriver of the type whose handle (1) has on its outside 
a first zone made of a smooth, in particular a hard 

material, and a second zone made of a material, in particular a 
flexible material, with a coefficient of friction distinctly 

higher than that of the first zone, this handle having successively 
a rear portion (3) with a relatively large cross-section, 

an intermediate portion (4) whose rear section (10) forms a connecting 
bulge to the rear portion, this bulge having a convex 

profile, the said intermediate portion being extended in a 
section converging towards the front, and a front portion (5) 

whence there emerges the blade (2) of the screwdriver, the said 
first zone of the handle (1) extending over substantially the 

whole rear portion (3) and over a length at least of the same 
order as the maximum diameter of the bulge (10), whilst the said 

second zone extends over substantially the whole front portion 
(5), with the possible exception of a front end portion (16) of 

the handle, each one of the two zones extending over the whole 
or virtually the whole contour of the handle in each one of the 

corresponding portions (3, 4, 5) of the handle, characterized in 
that the said second zone extends over substantially the whole of 

the intermediate portion (4). 
A screwdriver according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the said second zone extends continuously over its whole length. 
A screwdriver according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that the said first and second zones extend respectively over 

approximately one third and approximately two thirds of the 
length of the handle (1). 
A screwdriver according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that, with the possible exception of a front end portion 

(16) of the handle (1), the maximum areal cross-section of  
 

the handle is situated at the level of the said bulge (10) in the 
said second zone. 
A screwdriver according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that the rear portion (3) of the handle (1) has a 

spherical end (6) extending over more than a hemisphere, and a 
connecting section (7), flaring in particular towards the front, 

connected to this spherical end. 
A screwdriver according to claim 5, characterized in that 
the connecting section (7) has a substantially polygonal, in 

particular a square, cross-section with rounded corners. 
A screwdriver according to claim 5 or 6, characterized in 
that the spherical portion (6) is joined to the connecting section 

(7) by rounded portions with tangential rounded transitions 
(15). 
A screwdriver according to claim 7, characterized in that 
the whole of the handle (1) is devoid of any edge, with the possible 

exception of longitudinal fluted portions (14) provided on 
the front portion (5). 
A screwdriver according to any one of claims 1 to 8, characterized 
in that the front portion (5) of the handle (1) has, 

starting from its front end (12), a section with a cross-section 
increasing towards the rear, then a section with a cross-section 

decreasing towards the rear which connects it to the front end of 
the intermediate portion (4) of the handle.
