<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to thermal 
print media, and more particularly to minimizing the 
curl induced into transparent media during thermal 
printing. As is well known in the art, a thermal 
printhead utilizes a row of closely spaced 
electrically-resistive heater elements which are 
selectively energized to record data in hard copy 
form. To produce a high quality continuous-tone 
print using the thermal printing process, a dye donor 
media (sheet or web) and dye receiver media (sheet or 
web) are passed through the nip formed between a 
thermal printhead and a platen while heat is 
selectively applied to the dye donor sheet by image-wise 
energizing the heater elements that make up the 
thermal printhead. Dye is transferred from the dye 
donor media to the dye receiver media, which includes 
a dye receiver layer coated on an opaque or 
transparent support for reflective prints or for 
transparencies, respectively. A transparent support 
may be comprised of any suitable light transmissive 
material such as polyester film. Projection transparency dye receiver media 
exhibits an objectionable amount of curl (also 
referred to as warpage) as a result of heating the 
surface of the dye receiver media nearest to the 
thermal head during dye transfer. The curl problem 
becomes severe as attempts are made to print 
transparencies with high optical image densities  
 
(Dmax of about 1.8 or greater) which require the 
support surface nearest to the print head to 
experience temperatures significantly higher than the 
glass transition temperature (TG) of most common 
transparent support materials employed in 
transparencies. The curl of a projection 
transparency affects the quality of projected images, 
and it is preferred to have the finished projection 
transparency as flat as possible when placed upon a 
flat surface. Prior art approaches to controlling curl 
include the use of synthetic paper dye receiver media 
of at least three plies, each having different Cobb 
sizing degrees or internal bond strength to prevent 
curling when used for facsimile, thermal printing, 
etc. Another prior art approach involves the use of 
a paper support containing pigment and a rubbery 
polymer latex material providing a material that 
would yield reduced curl when imaged with a thermal 
head or heat pin. Still another curl prevention 
technique involves coating the surface of the 
substrate with a layer of resin that is neither heat 
expandable or contractible; preferably an acrylic 
resin. These approaches,
