<ABSTRACT>
Described is a process for the denitrification of sewage, the process using, in the high-concentration stage of a two-stage biological treatment plant, a system in which sedimentation of the activated sludge takes place in the same tank as the sludge is aerated (single-tank treatment), part of the sewage in which the nitrogen has been fixed in the low-concentration stage being pumped back to the high-concentration stage.

A process for the denitrification of waste water 
characterised in that used as a high-load stage of a two-stage 

biological purification installation is an apparatus in which 
sedimentation of the activated sludge is effected in the same tank as 

its intermittently operated aeration ('single-tank biology') and that 
the waste water which is nitrified in the low-load stage is partially 

pumped back into the high-load stage. 
A process as set forth in claim 1 characterised in that the 
single-tank biology operates with storage of the waste water of the 

feed flow during the aeration and settlement phase. 
A process as set forth in claim 1 characterised in that at 
least two single-tank biology systems are connected in parallel and 

operated in such a way as to avoid an accumulation during the aeration 
and settlement phase. 
A process as set forth in claim 1 characterised in that the 
high-load stage is hydraulically charged as constantly as possible by 

suitably adapted recycling of the post-purification tank discharge 
and/or by a feed of the excess water into the low-load stage. 
A process as set forth in one of claims 1 through 4 
characterised in that excess sludge is recycled from the low-load 

stage to the high-load stage in per se known manner.
