<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a gas turbine combustor which can reduce the
oscillations due to combustion, a gas turbine, and a jet engine which is provided with this
combustor.For gas turbines which output shaft power by compressing air as a working fluid
and heating it in a combustor, and expanding the thus produced high temperature and
high pressure gas in a turbine, and for also jet engines used to directly propel aircraft by
the kinetic energy produced by the output of a high speed jet in recent years, there has
been demand for a reduction in emissions such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) from the
environmental viewpoint.These gas turbines and jet engines have a compressor, a combustor, and a
turbine as their principle components, and the compressor and the turbine are directly
connected to each other by a main shaft. The combustor is connected to the outlet port
of the compressor, and the working fluid which is discharged by the compressor is heated
by the combustor to a predetermined turbine entrance temperature. The high
temperature and high pressure working fluid provided to the turbine, in the main casing,
passes between the static blades and the dynamic blades attached to the main shaft, and
expands, which rotates the main shaft and provides output power. In the case of a gas
turbine, the shaft power can be obtained by subtracting the power consumed by the
compressor from the total output power, and, the shaft power can be used as a driving 
source if an electric generator or the like is connected to one end of the main shaft.In order to reduce emissions, such as NOx and the like, from gas turbines and jet
engines, a variety of research and development projects concerning combustors are being
carried out. For premixing type combustors, it is known that NOx emissions can be
effectively reduced when mixture of the fuel gas and the air is homogeneous. In
contrast, when the mixture is not homogeneous, because local high temperature portions
occur in the high concentration regions of the flame, large quantities of NOx are
generated in the high temperature regions and the total emission of the combustor
increase. The invention of Japanese Unexamined Patent application, First publication
No. Hei 11-141878 is one prior art disclosing a solution to the problem of an
inhomogeneous mixture. This prior art discloses a gas turbine combustor provided with
a vane provided with a plurality of small holes at the air inflow side of the combustor to
distribute the inflowing air and provide a uniformly mixed
