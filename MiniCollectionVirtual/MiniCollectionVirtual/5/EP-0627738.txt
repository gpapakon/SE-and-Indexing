<ABSTRACT>
A magazine is provided for storing a plurality of cartridges for 
processing, the magazine providing an operator with a visual indication 

as to the processing status thereof. The magazine includes a base and a 
pair of elongated sidewalls which are mounted to the base in a 

spaced-apart relationship so as to receive the cartridges therebetween. 
A plurality of shelves are connected between the sidewalls of the 

magazine at spaced intervals therealong for slidably supporting the 
cartridges. The magazine sidewalls and shelves form a plurality of 

receptacles, each receptacle having oppositely located open ends so that 
each receptacle will accommodate the travel of a cartridge therethrough 

as the cartridge slides on the shelf. First and second stop devices are 
mounted within each receptacle for stopping travel of a cartridge through 

the receptacle at first and second positions therealong. The first 
position indicates that the cartridge has not been processed and the 

second position indicates that the cartridge has been processed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magazine for containing a 
plurality of cartridges, in particular electronic media cartridges, and 
more particularly to a magazine which will indicate the processing status 
of the cartridges contained therein. Further the invention relates to a 
cartridge processing device arranged to utilize a magazine according to 
the invention. When large volumes of data are to be processed in a computer 
system, it is convenient to employ magazines which accommodate numerous 
electronic media cartridges, such as magnetic tape cartridges. These 
magazines will typically contain ten or 12 cartridges in a vertically 
stacked array. The cartridges can be loaded in the magazine manually or 
by a remotely operated cartridge picker. Once the cartridges are loaded 
in the magazine, they are ready for processing, such as during a read 
operation by a tape drive. In order to perform this operation, a 
cartridge picker will remove the cartridge from the magazine, transport 
it to the tape drive and then return the cartridge to the magazine after 
processing. The advantage of a magazine is that it confines the cartridges to a 
compact area where they can be organized in some logical fashion. By 
having the cartridges vertically stacked they are efficiently positioned 
for transport operations by the cartridge picker. Because the magazine 
supports cartridges on individual shelves, the cartridges support only 
their own weight, and each cartridge can be easily slid along its shelf 
for the processing operation. Typically the cartridges are placed on 
shelves from an open side of the magazine and then processed from an 
opposite open side of the magazine. In the past, it has been very difficult to ascertain whether or not 
a particular cartridge in a magazine has been processed by the cartridge 
picker and cartridge drive. When the magazine is viewed by an operator 
there is no indication whether or not any processing has occurred. It 
can be envisioned that many different types of electronic indicators 
could be devised to provide a visible display. However, this requires a 
power source and adds undue complexity to the magazine. Therefore, it is 
desirable that a mechanical indicator be provided so that visual  
 
inspection of the magazine will indicate whether or not any one of the 
cartridges has been processed. An object of the present invention is to provide a cartridge 
magazine which will visually indicate whether or not any one of the 
cartridges in the magazine has been processed.

<CLAIMS>
A magazine for storing a plurality of cartridges for processing, 
the magazine comprising a base (46), a pair of elongated sidewalls (48, 

50) connected to the base in a spaced apart relationship so as to allow 
reception of cartridges therebetween, and a plurality of shelves (60) 

connected between the sidewalls of the magazine at spaced intervals 
therealong for slidably supporting the cartridges, the magazine sidewalls 

and shelves forming a plurality of receptacles (66), each receptacle 
having oppositely located open ends (68, 70) to accommodate the travel of 

a cartridge therethrough as the cartridge slides on a respective shelf, 
the magazine being characterized by: 

   first stop means (72) and second stop means (74) mounted within 
each receptacle (66) for stopping travel of a cartridge through the 

receptacle at first and second positions therealong, the first position 
for indicating that the cartridge has not been processed and the second 

position for indicating that the cartridge has been processed. 
A magazine as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that: 
   the first stop means (72) is arranged to stop a cartridge with an 

end (34) of the cartridge being substantially flush with an open end (70) 
of the receptacle for indicating that the cartridge has not been 

processed; and 
   the second stop means (74) is arranged to stop the cartridge with 

said end (34) of the cartridge protruding from said open end (70) of the 
receptacle for indicating that the cartridge has been processed. 
A magazine as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2, characterised in that: 
   at least one sidewall (48) of the magazine has a width which is 

less than the length of a cartridge so as to provide a side view of 
whether the cartridge is in the first position or the second position 

within the magazine. 
A magazine as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the first 
stop means (72) and second stop means (74) of each receptacle are 

connected to the respective shelf (60). 
A magazine as claimed in any preceding claims wherein the first and 
second stop means are provided by a pair of detents (72, 74) mounted to 

each shelf in a spaced apart relationship so as to accommodate the width 
of a cartridge; and 

   a first one (72) of tile detents of each pair of detents having a 
protrusion (86) for releasably engaging with a first notch (40) in a 

cartridge to stop the cartridge in a first position along the length of 
the shelf and the second one (74) of the detents of each pair of detents 

having a protrusion (94) for releasably engaging with a second notch (42) 
in a cartridge to stop the cartridge in a second position along the 

length of the shelf. 
A magazine as claimed in Claim 5, wherein the first detent (72) 
engages the cartridge within the first notch (40) and the second detent 

(74) substantially engages a rear end (34) of the cartridge when the 
cartridge is in the first position, and the second detent (74) engages 

the cartridge within the second notch (42) and the first detent slidably 
engages a side of the cartridge when the cartridge is in the second 

position. 
A magazine as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the 
cartridges to be stored by the magazine are electronic media cartridges. 
A cartridge processing device comprising a magazine for storing a 
plurality of cartridges for processing, a cartridge drive (25) for 

receiving and processing a cartridge by read and/or write operations, and 
a cartridge picker (26) for transporting a cartridge between the magazine 

(22) and the cartridge drive (25), the processing device being 
characterised in that: 

   the magazine is a magazine as claimed in any of Claims 1 to 7. 
A cartridge processing device for processing a plurality of 
electronic media cartridges, comprising a magazine for holding a 

plurality of cartridges, a cartridge drive for receiving and processing a 
cartridge by read and/or write operations, and a cartridge picker for 

transporting a cartridge between the magazine and the cartridge drive, 
the device being characterised in that:

 
   the magazine is arranged to hold a plurality of cartridges at 

visible first and second stop positions, the first stop position
