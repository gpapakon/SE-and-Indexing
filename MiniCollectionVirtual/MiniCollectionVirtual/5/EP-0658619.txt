<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to photoreceptor substrates. More particularly, this invention
relates to methods of lathing and cleaning photoreceptor substrates.Many electrophotographic copiers, digital copiers, laser printers, and the like contain
an electrophotographic photoreceptor wherein a photoconductive layer is provided on a
rotatable drum-like substrate. The substrate may be made by machining the surface of a pipe,
and a cutting fluid is normally used in this process. The cutting fluid is used to cool, lubricate,
and clean the substrate. Many current processes for machining photoreceptor substrates use a
petroleum-based cutting fluid.For inspection purposes and to prepare the substrates for final cleaning and coating
of photoconductor layers, the substrates are cleaned after machining to remove residual
cutting fluid. Typically, petroleum residues on a substrate are removed by methods using an
ultrasonic vapor degreaser with a chlorine solvent, such as, for example, 1,1,1-trichloroethane,
trichloroethylene, perchloroethylene, methylene chloride, and the like. However, the use of
such solvents can cause problems of environmental contamination and working safety from the
viewpoint of ozone layer destruction, carcinogenicity and the like.Alternatives to chlorine-containing solvents include aliphatic hydrocarbons such as
kerosene or strong acid-based detergents. However, these alternatives can present new
problems including fire risks and waste neutralization.A preferred alternative to chlorine solvents would be a neutral aqueous cleaner. A
number of commercial aqueous cutting fluids which are cleaned with neutral aqueous cleaners
have been found to be unsatisfactory. A major problem with these cutting fluids is that they
either attack metal on the substrate surface or alter the substrate surface chemistry, especially
with aluminum substrates, so that the substrate has the undesirable
characteristic of wetting after subsequent cleaning.This invention provides a method of cleaning photoreceptor substrates, wherein the
residues of the cutting fluid can be removed from the substrate by deionized water alone.
Because deionized water can be used to remove the cutting fluid residues, the removal of the
cutting fluid residues from the substrate does not pose a risk to the environment or to working
safety. Furthermore, the cutting fluid of this invention does not attack metal on the substrate
surface or alter the surface chemistry so that the substrate has the
undesirable characteristic of wetting after
