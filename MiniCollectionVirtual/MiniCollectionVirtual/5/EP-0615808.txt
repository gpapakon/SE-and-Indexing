<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the art of arc welding 
and more particularly to a method and system for controlling 
the welding process or cycle of an arc welder of the type 
having a power supply driven by a weld controller having an 
output signal indicative of, and controlled by, several 
welding parameters such as current, desired voltage, wire 
feed, shielding gas, peak current, background current, ramp 
rate, and instantaneous power. The present invention is particularly applicable to an 
arc welder of the type used for supplying a continuous wire 
or electrode to a welding operation at a preselected speed 
and with shielding gas; however, the invention is much 
broader and is particularly applicable for use with a welder 
that has a weld controller to cause the welding cycle or 
process of the welder to operate in accordance with one of a 
number of interrelated, and independently controlled, welding 
parameters. In the welding field, it is common practice to provide 
a power supply having output terminals for directing a welding 
current across the gap between an electrode and 
workpiece with a weld controller that controls the welding 
current, welding voltage, and wire speed in a manner to perform 
a desired welding operation, such as TIG welding, gas 
metal arc welding, etc. In carrying out the various welding 
processes or cycles, an operator selects certain parameters 
and adjusts the output current according to the welding process 
being performed. This requires a substantial amount of 
manipulation and skill of the welder to perform the various 
welding processes in an optimum manner. For every welding 
cycle the various parameters should be controlled in accordance 
with well known welding art; however, this art is generally 
known by only a few highly skilled people, such as  
 
welding engineers. Consequently, when welding processes are 
performed by various operators, the resulting welding process 
is somewhat inconsistent and is not controlled in accordance 
with highly specialized technical characteristics 
indicative of proper welding procedure for each welding cycle 
or process and the vicissitudes of the specific welding 
operation being performed. There is a substantial demand for a welding control 
system wherein each welding cycle can be controlled accurately 
and in accordance with proper welding technology irrespective 
of the operator performing the welding operation 
or the particular electrode size, the gas being used, and/or 
the feed rate being employed at any given
