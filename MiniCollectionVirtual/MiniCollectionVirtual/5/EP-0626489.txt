<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device and to a method for filling joints, making it possible, in a single operation and without leaving any soiling, to apply cement mortar of suitable consistency directly between bricks or other filling materials, in sufficient quantities depending on the depth of joint desired and, at the same time to smooth it off if need be. The joint-filling device includes an upper part (1) made of a flexible material, preferably having the form of a cone, and a rigid lower part termed "adapter" (3) in the form of a funnel allowing the cement mortar to be inserted directly inside the place to be filled, simply by pressing on the upper part (1), it being possible for the said adapter (3) to be equipped with an injection tube (6) or with any other complementary device such as a smoothing knife of appropriate shape, or the like. The filling device and filling method according to the invention are intended for making joints, various refilling operations, particularly in masonry, these being done in a single operation.
