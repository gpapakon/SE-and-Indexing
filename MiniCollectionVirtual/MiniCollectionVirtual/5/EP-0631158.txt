<ABSTRACT>
A method for forming a grating in a photosensitive medium (18) such 

as 
a photosensitive optical fiber. The method comprises impinging a pair 

of interfering, 
actinic beams (15,16) onto the medium, and during the impinging step, 

advancing 
the illuminated portion of the interference pattern relative to the 

medium. The 
advancement is carried out without changing the phase, or registration, 

of the 
interference pattern. A grating having a spatially dependent refractive 

index 
perturbation (amplitude chirp) is produced by varying the dose 

(intensity) of actinic radiation received by the 
medium during the advancement.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to the processing of photosensitive materials to 
form optical elements, and more specifically to the formation of passive optical 
components that are integrated with waveguiding articles such as optical fibers. Along with photoresists and the like, certain optical media, including at 
least some silica-based optical fibers, can be modified by exposure to 
electromagnetic radiation in an appropriate spectral range. (Such radiation, typically 
ultraviolet radiation, is referred to below as "actinic" radiation.) That is, exposure of 
a photosensitive optical fiber (or other optical medium) to actinic radiation may 
cause the refractive index to change in the exposed portion of the medium. A 
periodic pattern can be imposed on the impinging radiation by, e.g., superimposing a 
pair of beams of substantially monochromatic radiation from, e.g., a laser, to create 
an interference pattern. If two beams of wavelength λ intersect at an intersection 
angle , the resulting interference pattern will have a period Λ given by 
Λ = 0.5λcsc 2 
 When such a patterned radiation field impinges on an optical fiber 
or other optical waveguide having a core of the appropriate photosensitivity, a 
corresponding pattern is imposed on the core in the form of periodic (or 
quasiperiodic) fluctuations in the core refractive index. Such a pattern, which is often 
referred to as a "Bragg grating" or a "distributed Bragg reflector (DBR)" can behave 
as a spectrally selective reflector for electromagnetic radiation. Bragg gratings 
formed in this manner are particularly useful as end-reflectors in optical fiber lasers. 
These Bragg gratings are useful both because they are spectrally selective, and 
because they are readily incorporated in the same optical fiber that supports the 
active laser medium. A technique for creating these Bragg gratings is described in U.S. Patent 
No. 4,725,110, issued to W.H. Glenn, et al. on Feb. 16, 1988, and U.S. Patent 
No. 4,807,950, issued to W.H. Glenn, et al. on Feb. 28, 1989. An optical fiber laser 
having a DBR-terminated cavity is described in G.A. Ball and W.W. Morey, 
"Continuously tunable single-mode erbium fiber laser", OpticsLett.17 (1992) 420 - 
422.  Bragg gratings are useful as passive optical components for other 
applications besides end-reflectors in fiber lasers. For example, Bragg gratings are 
useful as spectral filters for wavelength-division multiplexing and other optical 
signal-processing applications. An optical filter which comprises a Bragg

A method for forming a refractive index perturbation, to be referred to 
as a "Bragg grating", in a photosensitive optical medium having an optical 

propagation axis which defines an axial direction, the method comprising the steps 
of: 


a) producing two collimated, non-collinear beams of electromagnetic 
radiation having an actinic wavelength λ; 
b) impinging the actinic beams on at least a portion of the medium such 
that the beams intersect at an angle , resulting in the creation of an interference 

pattern periodic in the axial direction and having an illuminated portion that falls on 
the impinged portion of the medium; and 
c) axially advancing the illuminated portion of the interference pattern 
relative to the medium such that at least local coherence of the interference pattern is 

preserved, and a refractive index perturbation is produced in the medium, wherein 
each point of the perturbation receives a dose of actinic radiation, and the 

perturbation has an average amplitude; 
 
   CHARACTERIZED IN THAT the method further includes: 

   during the advancing step, varying the dose of actinic radiation, such 
that the average amplitude of the resulting refractive index perturbation varies in the 

axial direction according to a predetermined pattern. 
The method of claim 1, wherein during (c) the illuminated portion of 
the interference pattern is advanced with a velocity ν, and the dose-varying step 

comprises varying ν. 
The method of claim 1, wherein each of the actinic beams has an 
average intensity, and the dose-varying step comprises varying the average 

intensities of the actinic beams. 
The method of claim 3, wherein the actinic beams are produced by a 
pulsed radiation source, and the dose-varying step comprises varying the pulse 

repetition rate of the radiation source.
