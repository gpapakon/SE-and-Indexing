<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a base part serving as heat sink in a plastic package (7), the upper face (11) of the base part being in thermal contact with a semiconductor chip (1), the lower face (15) coming flush at the level of a main face of the package (7). This base part is formed from a substantially square metal sheet, each of the corners of which is folded into a tab (15) so as to obtain a substantially square base part, the face comprising folds corresponding to the lower face of the base part.

<CLAIMS>
A base serving as a heat sink in a plastic casing,
the upper surface (11) of the heat sink being in thermal

contact with the semiconductor chip (1), the lower surface
(15) being flush with a main surface of the casing,

characterized in that it is formed by using a substantially
square metal sheet having each of its corners

folded as a tongue (15) to provide a substantially square
platform (11), the surface including the folded tongues

corresponding to the lower surface of the base, and in
that fins (12) are coupled to the platform (11) by

connecting arms (13).
The base of claim 1, characterized in that each
connecting arm (13) is curved so that, after folding, the

lower surface of the fins is positioned along the same
plane as the lower surface of the tongues.
The base of claim 1, characterized in that the
connecting arms of the fins substantially extend from the

central portions of the platform sides before the tongues
are folded.
The base of claim 1, characterized in that the
tongues are folded so that they do not contact each

other.
The base of claim 1, characterized in that the
folded tongues do not contact each other at least near

the corners of the platform after folding so that the
platform (11) at least partially protrudes with respect

to the lower surface.
The base of claim 1, characterized in that said
metal sheet, before being folded, includes apertures near

the folding lines, and at least externally with respect
to the folding lines. 
The base of claim 1, characterized in that it is
formed from an aluminum sheet.
