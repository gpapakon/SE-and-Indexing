<ABSTRACT>
A juice extractor for extracting juice from fruit or 
vegetable material includes a main body (14) which 

contains a motor (12) and housing (18) which contains two 
cooperating rotatable squeezing rollers (16,17), one of 

which is coupled to the output shaft of the motor (12). 
The main body (14) and the housing (18) are releasably 

connected together. Interposed between the housing and 
main body is a gearbox (20) including a first rotary 

shaft (30) which is rotationally coupled to the output 
shaft (26) and carries a first clutch gear (48) and a 

second shaft (40) which is rotationally coupled to the 
first shaft (30) by means of meshing gears (36,42) to 

rotate slower than the first shaft and in the opposite 
direction and carries a second clutch gear (50). A 

connection gear (68) is in mesh with the two clutch gears 
(48,50) and is connected to a member (70) have a screw 

threaded portion (72) which projects beyond the gearbox 
and is in screw threaded engagement with a screw threaded 

hole (73) in the housing (18). Clutching means (74) 
cooperates with the clutch gears (48,50) and is 

externally actuable to move between two positions in 
which a respective one of the clutch gears (48,50) is 

rotationally connected to the associated shaft (30,40) 
and a neutral position in which neither of the clutch 

gears is coupled to the associated shaft. By 
appropriately positioning the clutching means and 

subsequent actuation of the motor the screw threaded 
portion may be rotated in either direction to screw the 

screw threaded portion into and out of the corresponding 
screw threaded hole in the housing so as to connect and 

disconnect the main body and the housing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a juice extractor of the 
type referred to in the precharacterising portion of 
claim 1 and is concerned with the releasable connection 
between the main body and the housing. Juice extractors of the type referred to above generally 
include an electric motor as the power source and the 
housing containing the squeezing rollers, which is 
connected to the main body, generally has a surface which 
engages a corresponding surface on the main body. Juice 
containing material, such as vegetables or fruit, is 
supplied to the housing, typically into a hopper which 
communicates with the interior of the housing, and is 
compressed and squeezed by the squeezing rollers and 
discharged from the extractor after separating the juice 
from the dregs, i.e. the solid material. In practice, a 
proportion of the dregs always remains within the housing 
which necessitates careful washing with water prior to 
the next time the juice extractor is used. For this 
purpose the main body and the housing are separable and 
the housing is detached from the main body. Conventionally, the housing is detachably connected to 
the main body by means of a bolt-nut assembly or a clip 
assembly. U.S. Patent No.5,156,872 discloses a juice 
extractor of the type referred to above in which the two 
sections of the outer casing, i.e. the housing for the 
squeezing rollers and the main body, are detachably 
connected by means of a two-part clip. This clip is 
mechanically complex and not wholly reliable in the long 
term and its appearance is not aesthetically pleasing. It is therefore the object of the present invention to 
provide a juice extractor of the type referred to above 
in which the main body and the housing are connected  
 
together by means which are both simple and reliable and 
which have no visual impact on the external appearance of 
the extractor. According to the present invention, a juice extractor of 
the type referred to above is characterised by a gearbox 
including a first rotary shaft which is rotationally 
coupled to the output shaft and carries a first clutch 
gear which is selectively rotationally engageable with 
it, a second shaft which is rotationally coupled to the 
first shaft to rotate in the opposite direction and 
carries a second clutch gear which is selectively 
rotationally engageable with it, a connection gear which 
is in mesh with the two clutch gears and is connected to 
a member having a screw threaded portion which projects 
beyond the gearbox and is in screw

A juice extractor for extracting juice from fruit or 
vegetable material including a main body (14) which 

contains a motor (12) and a housing (18) which contains 
two cooperating rotatable squeezing rollers (16,17), one 

of which is coupled to the output shaft (26) of the motor 
(12), the main body (14) and the housing (18) being 

releasably connected together characterised by a gearbox 
(20) including a first rotary shaft (30) which is 

rotationally coupled to the output shaft (26) and carries 
a first clutch gear (48) which is selectively 

rotationally engageable with it, a second shaft (40) 
which is rotationally coupled to the first shaft (30) to 

rotate in the opposite direction and carries a second 
clutch gear (50) which is selectively rotationally 

engageable with it, a connection gear (68) which is in 
mesh with the two clutch gears (48,50) and is connected 

to a member (70) having a screw threaded hole (72) 
which projects beyond the gearbox (20) and is in screw 

threaded engagement with a screw threaded hole (73) on 
the housing (18) and clutching means (74) cooperating 

with the clutch gears (48,50) which is externally 
actuable between a first position, in which the first 

clutch gear (48) is rotationally coupled to the first 
shaft (30) and the second clutch gear (50) is not coupled 

to the second shaft (40), a second position, in which the 
second clutch gear (50) is rotationally coupled to the 

second shaft (40) and the first clutch gear (48) is not 
coupled to the first shaft (30), and a neutral position, 

in which neither clutch gear (48,50) is rotationally 
coupled to the associated shaft (30,40).  

 
A juice extractor as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised in that the first and second shafts (30,40) 

are rotationally coupled by means of meshing gears 
(3,6,4,2) that one of the shafts (40) rotates more slowly 

than the other shaft (30). 
A juice extractor as claimed in claim 2, 
characterised in that the end of the shaft (40) which 

rotates more slowly has a non-circular portion (41) which 
projects out of the gearbox (20) and is received in a 

correspondingly shaped hole in one end of one (16) of one 
of the s
queezing rollers.
