<ABSTRACT>
The drilling chuck has clamping jaws (2) which form a receptacle for the drilling tool and are adjustable by a clamping ring (5) guided on the chuck body (6). A retaining ring (13) serves to lock the clamping ring (5), for which purpose the axially displaceable retaining ring (13) is held by a retaining spring (28) in the advanced locking position against the clamping ring (5). A holding ring (16) is connected to the retaining ring (13) via an adjusting device, by means of which the retaining ring (13), during the turning of the holding ring (16) relative to the retaining ring (13), can be displaced between its locking position and an unlocking position releasing the clamping ring (5) for turning.

A drilling chuck comprising a chuck body (6) which can be 
connected to a drilling spindle, clamping jaws (2) which form between 

them a receiving means for the drilling tool and which for opening and 
closing of the drilling chuck are displaceable by a clamping ring (5) 

guided rotatably and axially immovably on the chuck body (6), further 
comprising a locking ring (13) for locking the clamping ring (5), for 

which purpose the locking ring (13) is axially displaceably guided on 
the chuck body (6) and is held by the force of a locking spring (28) in 

the locking position of being pushed forward towards the clamping ring 
(5), further comprising a holding ring (16) which is arranged coaxially 

on the drilling chuck (1) and which is axially immovable and rotatable 
in the peripheral direction, and a setting means which is operative 

between the holding ring (16) and the locking ring (13) and by which, 
upon rotation of the holding ring (16) relative to the locking ring 

(13), the latter is displaceable between its locking position and an 
unlocking position of releasing the clamping ring (5) for the rotary 

movement, for which purpose the setting means is formed by a setting cam 
(21) on the one member (13, 16), either the locking ring or the holding 

ring, and a setting member (22) on the other member, which setting 
member is movable along the setting cam (21) upon mutual rotary movement 

of the two members, characterised in that the holding ring (16) is 
mounted on the chuck body (6) and its rotary travel relative to the 

chuck body (6) is limited by abutments (52, 53), that the locking spring 
forms a retaining means which fixes the locking ring (13) at least in 

the locking position and which is operative between the locking ring 
(13) and the holding ring (16) and which in conjunction with the setting 

means is of such a configuration that the setting member (22) bears 
against the setting cam (21) under the force of the locking spring (28) 

and the setting cam (21) forms for the setting member (22) a first 
retaining seat (21.1) which permits the locking ring (13) to adopt the 

locking position, and has inclined setting cam ramps (21.2, 21.3) which 
adjoin said first retaining seat (21.1) in both directions of rotation 

and at which the setting member (22) is displaced by the axial stroke 
movement required for displacement of the locking ring (13) out of the 

locking position into the unlocking position.  
 
A drilling chuck according to claim 1 characterised in that 
the holding ring (16) is arranged on the chuck body (6) axially beside 

the locking ring (13) and is provided with a sleeve (26) which engages 
over and covers the locking ring (13) at its outer peripheral surface in 

such a way that the locking ring (13) is inaccessible for direct 
actuation by hand. 
A drilling chuck according to claim 2 characterised in that 
the holding ring (16) and the clamping ring (5) together cover over the 

chuck body (6) in an outward direction substantially over the entire 
axial length thereof. 
A drilling chuck according to one of claims 1 to 3 
characterised in that the retaining means also fixes the locking ring 

(13) in the unlocking position and for that purpose the setting cam ramp 
(21.3) which follows the first retaining seat (21.1) in the direction of 

rotation of the clamping ring (5) corresponding to closure of the 
drilling chuck terminates in a second retaining seat (21.4) for the 

setting member (22), in which the setting member (22) holds the locking 
rag (13) in the unlocking position. 
A drilling chuck according to one of claims 1 to 4 

characterised in that the setting means is in the form of positive 
guidance of the locking ring (13) and the holding ring (16) against each 

other and the retaining means is operative between the locking ring (13) 
and the chuck body (6). 
A drilling chuck according to claim 5 characterised in that in 
the positive guidance of the locking ring (13) and the holding ring (16) 

against each other, which is formed by the setting means, the direction 
of rotation of the holding ring (16) for setting the locking ring (13) 

in the locking position is opposite to the direction of rotation of the 
clamping ring (5) for closure of the drilling chuck (1).  

 
A drilling chuck according to claim 5 or claim 6 characterised 
in that the setting cam (21) of the setting means is formed by the side 

walls of a setting groove, between which the setting member (22) axially 
positively lockingly engages. 
A drilling chuck according to one of claims 1 to 7 
characterised in that disposed axially opposite the first retaining seat 

(21.1) is an abutment cam (21.5) for the setting member (22), which 
prevents direct axial displacement of the locking ring (13) out of the 

locking position into the unlocking position. 
A drilling chuck according to one of claims 1 to 8 
characterised in that the setting cam (21, 21.5) is formed by the edge 

of a pocket (100) which is provided in the outer peripheral surface of 
the locking ring (13) and into which the setting member (22) carried on 

the holding ring (16) engages, the holding ring (16) covering over the 
pocket (100) and closing it in an outward direction. 
A drilling chuck according to claim 9 characterised in that at 
least one of the abutments limiting the rotary travel of the holding 

ring (16) is also provided on the pocket edge (52). 
A drilling chuck according to one of claims 1 to 10 
characterised in that to provide the abutments for limiting the rotary 

travel of the holding ring (16) relative to the chuck body (6), one of 
the members, the chuck body or the holding ring, has at least one flat 

surface (18) which is parallel to the axis and opposite which are 
disposed on the other member two abutment surfaces (53) which are 

parallel to the axis and which are inclined relative to each other and 
which by virtue of their mutual inclined positioning determine the angle 

through which the holding ring (16) is rotatable at a maximum relative 
to the chuck body (6).  

 
A drilling chuck according to one of claims 1 to 11 
characterised in that the locking ring (13) is rotatably mounted on the 

chuck body (6) and is limited in its rotary travel between two further 
abutments (19), wherein the rotary travel of the locking ring (13) 

determines the maximum possible rotary travel of the clamping ring (5) 
for automatic take-up adjustment of the drilling chuck during the 

drilling operation and in comparison therewith the rotary travel of the 
holding ring (16) in both directions of rotation is even larger by a 

setting travel which is required upon further rotary movement of the 
holding ring (16) relative to the locking ring (13) for displacement 

thereof between the locking position and the unlocking position. 
A drilling chuck according to claim 12 characterised in that 
arranged between the locking ring (13) and the chuck body (6) is a takeup 

adjustment spring which urges the locking ring (13) relative to the 
chuck body (6) in the direction of rotation of the clamping ring (5), 

which corresponds to closure of the drilling chuck. 
A drilling chuck according to claim 12 or claim 13 
characterised in that at least one flat surface (18) which is parallel 

to the axis is provided to form the abutments on the chuck body (6), 
which limit the rotary travels of the locking ring (13) and the holding 

rag (16) relative to the chuck body (6), opposite which flat surface 
are disposed on each of the locking ring (13) and the holding ring (16) 

two abutment surfaces (19, 53) which are parallel to the axis and which 
are inclined relative to each other and which by virtue of their mutual 

inclined positioning determine the angle through which the locking ring 
(13) and the holding ring (16) are respectively rotatable at a maximum 

relative to the chuck body (6).
