<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to molding 
thermoplastic materials and more particularly to 
insulated molds formed by a process resulting in a void 
free insulating layer having improved thermal and 
physical properties. Molding of thermoplastic resins is a promising 
technique for producing relatively thin, large areas 
and strong plastic parts such as panels for use in 
automobiles or appliances. Depending on specific 
requirements, such plastic parts can be made by any of 
a number of molding processes such as blow molding, 
injection molding, compression molding and injection 
compression molding. Blow molding involves the 
extrusion of a molten tube of resin called a parison 
into a mold. The mold closes around the parison, 
pinching the bottom of the parison closed. A gas such 
as air is then introduced causing the tube to expand 
against the cool surfaces of the mold. When the 
parison comes into contact with the cool mold surface, 
the plastic at the surface quickly freezes. This 
results in surface imperfections such as die lines, 
fold lines, pores and voids. Injection molding involves injecting molten 
thermoplastic resin into a mold apparatus. Molds for 
injection molding of thermoplastic resin are usually 
made from metal material such as iron, steel, stainless 
steel, aluminum alloy or brass. Such materials are 
advantageous in that they have high thermal 
conductivity and thus allow the melt of thermoplastic 
resin to cool rapidly and shorten the molding cycle  
 
surface, resulting in a thin solid layer. Quick 
quenching of the melt at the mold surface creates 
several problems, particularly when molding resins 
which contain large amounts of fillers in the form of 
fibers and powders. The freezing of these materials at 
the mold surface creates a rough unfinished surface 
with exposed fillers, voids and porosity. Processing difficulties arise when producing thin, 
large parts by injection molding. The quick 
solidification of the melt combined with limited 
flowability of the materials makes it difficult to 
achieve melt flow over a large area. The use of 
multiple gates for large and/or complex mold cavities 
produces weld lines, which are unsightly and weak. 
Another important consideration in injection molding of 
high quality parts is the residual stresses in the 
molded part which can result in dimensional instability 
over the lifetime of the part. Non-uniform residual 
stresses also produce differential refractive indices. 
Dimensional stability and uniformity of
