<ABSTRACT>
The object of the present invention is to provide a 
trigger for regenerative substances which is capable of 

causing crystallization of regenerative substances with 
certainty when a regenerative body having a trigger is used, 

and to provide a regenerative body having a trigger for 
regenerative substances. 
 
The regenerative body 6 comprises:
 

   a trigger for regenerative substances 3 which is 
constructed by laminating a plurality of elastic flat elements 

1a and 1b, and by securing the flat elements 1a and 1b at at 
least two positions with vises 2a and 2b (a securing means); 

and
 

   regenerative substances 4 which are in a supercooled 
state and which receive a

 
physical stimulus from the trigger for regenerative substances

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a trigger for
regenerative substances in accordance with the generic clause of claim 1, and particularly relates to a trigger
for regenerative substances which causes liquid regenerative
substances in a supercooled state to begin crystallization.Such a trigger is already disclosed in
document EP 0 151 352. This document already
discloses a trigger for regenerative substances
which is bendable with snap displacement to
initiate crystallisation.From document US-A- 309 3 308
there is also known a trigger, which may be
a bi-metal formed of two dissimilar
metals. There is also shown a triggering
device that comprises two rubbing elements
that are moved relative to each otherAs a regenerative substance, a substance such as 3-hydrates
of sodium acetate has been conventionally used,
taking advantage of its character to absorb or radiate a
latent heat, due to phase changes between freezing and
melting. After such a regenerative substance melts by heat
and when it is cooled down to its freezing point, it begins
crystallizing and simultaneously radiating a latent heat, and
enters into a state of heat generation. However, the
regenerative substance sometimes does not crystallize and
reaches a supercooled state even if it is cooled down to its
freezing point or a lower temperature.As an example method for preventing such a supercooled
state of the above-described regenerative substance, it is
known that a crystalline nucleus forming material may be
previously added to the regenerative substance, as disclosed
in the official gazette of Japanese Patent Laid-Open (Kokai)
Publication No. SHO 58-99696.  According to this conventional example, the addition of a
crystalline nucleus forming material to a regenerative
substance may prevent the regenerative substance from reaching
a supercooled state. Thus, when the regenerative substance is
cooled down to its freezing point, it begins to crystallize
and radiate a latent heat.In this case, however, the fact that the regenerative
substance always has to be kept in a melting state at the
melting point or higher temperatures is problematic.At the same time, it is possible to intentionally
maintain the supercooled state of the regenerative substance
by not adding a crystalline nucleus forming material to the
regenerative substance (thus preventing the regenerative
substance from crystallizing even if the temperature lowers).
By using this technology, we may apply a physical stimulus to
the regenerative substance whenever necessary, and cause it
