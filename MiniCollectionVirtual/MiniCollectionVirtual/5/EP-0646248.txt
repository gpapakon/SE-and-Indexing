<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and a device for supervising the condition of an antenna (6) by measuring the ratio of the magnitude (Pf) of a transmitted signal to the magnitude (Pr) of a signal reflected from the antenna (6) and by using, in addition to fixed alarm limits (TH1), an adjustable alarm limit (TH2), by means of which the condition of the transmitter device (1) can be found out.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for supervising the
condition of a transmitter antenna, comprising steps of
providing a first fixed alarm limit, transmitting a signal to an
antenna line, measuring the magnitude of said signal, measuring
the magnitude of the portion of said signal reflected from the
antenna through the antenna line, providing a measuring signal
on the basis of the ratio of the measured magnitudes of said
reflected signal and said transmitted signal, the level of said
measuring signal representing a condition of the antenna, and
switching off the transmitter device when said level of
measuring signal exceeds said first fixed alarm limit.The invention also relates to a device for supervising the
condition of a transmitter antenna, said device comprising a
measuring unit for measuring the magnitude of a signal
transmitted to the antenna through an antenna line and the
magnitude of a signal reflected from the antenna through the
antenna line, a circuit for providing a measuring signal on the
basis of the ratio of the measured magnitudes of the reflected
signal and said transmitted signal, the level of said measuring
signal representing a condition of the antenna, and a first
alarm limit of a fixed level.An essential part of radio systems, such as mobile phone
systems and their base stations, is formed by receiver and
transmitter antennas, the condition of which has a direct
effect on the quality of transmissions in the radio systems.
The condition of antennas can be supervised, for instance, by
measuring their standing-wave ratio, i.e. the electric
matching of the antennas to the rest of the receiving and
transmitting system. Conventionally the measuring is carried
out by measuring the power supplied to the antenna line and
the power reflected from the antenna through the antenna
line. The meter has to be a wideband 
power meter, and thus the power supplied for the
measurement has to be high in order for the signals
received by the antenna not to interfere with the
measurement. However, the use of high power usually
causes distortion in electronic circuits, wherefore the
measurement result is not reliable. Distortion can be
reduced by various filters, but these reduce the
accuracy of the measurement result. There are also
solutions in which the problems described above have
been solved by using as a measuring signal a measuring
frequency outside the frequency band of the system and
by using narrowband power measurement specifically
matched to the measuring frequency.European Patent
