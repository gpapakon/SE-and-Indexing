<ABSTRACT>
When information signals are recorded on an information 
signal recording medium formed with circular information 

signal tracks, the information signals are recorded after 
scrambled with scrambling signals of cyclic codes. The 

period at which the scrambling signal makes a round is 
determined longer than a time length of an information 

signal quantity recorded on the maximum recording capacity 
(e.g., the outermost tracks), or a part of the scrambling 

signals are used repeatedly. The information signal 
recording method can remove the correlation between the 

adjacent tracks, and thereby to enable a stable tracking 
control.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of recording
information signals on an information signal recording
medium formed with a plurality of circular tracks, and more
specifically to a method of recording information signals
scrambled with scrambling signals.In general, in an optical disk such as a compact disk
(CD), digital signals are recorded by forming concave and
convex portions (referred to as pit and land portions) along
tracks formed on the disk, and the light reflected from the
pit and land portions is received by a quadrant optical
sensor housed in an optical head, and further converted
into electric signals to read information signals from the
optical disk.For focusing the detection light onto the optical disk,
an objective lens of the optical system housed in a pickup
is so controlled as to follow the surface deflection of the
disk in accordance with astigmatic method, for instance.
In addition, for tracking to eccentric tracks, the pickup
is so controlled as to follow the tracks in accordance with
three-beam method, push-pull method, heterodyne method,
etc.In the focusing and tracking control, the respective
output signals of the double- or quadrant-divided optical
sensor are calculated to obtain a focusing control signal
and a tracking control signal for servo-controlling.A laser beam emitted by the pickup produces a phase
difference between the beam reflected from the pit portion
and the beam reflected from the land portion, so that it 
is possible to obtain reproduced signals on the basis of
the difference in reflected light intensity caused by the
interference effect and then incident upon the optical
sensor. In the case of a compact disk, data are recorded
by forming pit and land pattern on the basis of EFM (eight
to fourteen modulation) signals. Therefore, the recorded
data can be reproduced by binarizing the reproduced signals
modulated on the basis of the light intensity change along
the pit and the land portions, and further demodulated into
digital signals.In the signal recording system, two systems, that is,
a CAV (constant angular velocity) system in which the disk
angular velocity is kept constant and CLV (constant linear
velocity) system in which the track linear velocity is kept
constant are so far known. In the case of the CAV system,
the number of sectors of each track is equal to each other,
and all the tracks are so formed that the sector heads of
all the tracks are perfectly arranged on the radial lines
extending from the disk center.Further, in the case of the CLV
