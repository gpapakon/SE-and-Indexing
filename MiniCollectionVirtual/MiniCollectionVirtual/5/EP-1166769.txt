<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a novel lipid composition
for use in cosmetics capable of increasing moisture-keeping

ability or barrier function of the stratum corneum,
protecting the skin and improving dry or rough skin, and to

products which use the same, such as cosmetics and
medicaments. Particularly, it relates to a lipid

composition which comprises at least one component (A)
selected from the group consisting of a 2-acylaminoalkane-1,3-diol

and optically active compounds thereof, at least
one component (B) selected from the group consisting of a

2-acylaminoalkane-1,3-diol in which at least one of the α-position
and β-position of the acyl group is substituted

with hydroxyl group and optically active compounds thereof
and at least one component (C) selected from sterols,

wherein the components (A), (B) and (C) are mixed at a
ratio that constructs a liquid crystal structure, and to

products which contain the lipid composition, such as
cosmetics and medicaments.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel composition having a liquid crystal structure, and in particular, to a mixture of compounds belonging to the ceramide family, sterol family and a medium suitable for cosmetics or medicaments.In order to keep smooth skin by adding moisture to the skin and inhibiting abnormal transpiration of moisture from the skin, it is considered that moisture-keeping ability of the stratum corneum of the skin has an important role. Moisture in the stratum corneum contains many water-soluble components such as free amino acids, organic acids, urea and inorganic ions, and they are considered to be concerned in the moisture-keeping of the stratum corneum, so that these substances are practically used for the purpose of improving or preventing dry or rough skin by adding them alone or in combination to cosmetics and external drug preparations for skin use.Recently, it has been revealed that intercellular lipidsin the stratum corneum control transpiration of moisture from the body and keep softness and smoothness of the skin by preventing invasion of stimulants from the outside.The intercellular lipid are composed of a ceramide as the main component and other components such as cholesterol sulfate, palmitic acid and cholesterol. Regarding a ceramide which corresponds to a racemic compound of general formula (II) that will be described later, preparation of a ceramide composition mixed with the same components described above is disclosed in JP-A-4-327563 (the term "JP-A" as used herein means an "unexamined published Japanese patent application").It has been confirmed that such an intercellular lipid in stratum corneum or ceramide composition has high moisture-keeping ability. Taking these circumstances into consideration, ceramides such as racemic ceramide, pseudoceramide and glycosyl ceramide have recently been obtained by certain means such as chemical synthesis or extraction from natural materials, and, with the aim of improving conditions of the skin, studies have been positively conducted on the application of foundation cosmetics and medicaments mixed with a lipid composition containing these components to the improvement of dry or rough skin.Since ceramide is hardly soluble in water or organic solvents, for the purpose of applying ceramide to the skin, it is necessary to use it by firstly preparing a lipid composition having a specified mixing ratio so as to form a lamellar liquid crystal structure, and then effect formation of a lamellar liquid crystal phase and then converting the
