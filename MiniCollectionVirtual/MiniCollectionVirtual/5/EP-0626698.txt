<ABSTRACT>
A safety system grade dropped rod detection system 
for a pressurized water reactor (PWR) (3) utilizes core 

exit thermocouples (45) arranged in multiple trains (51) 

and hot and cold leg RTDs (41, 43) to generate a safety 
system grade rod stop signal. The system generates from 

the temperature signals a relative power deviation (RD) and 
a curvature index (CI), which is the spatial second derivative 

of RD for each fuel assembly (11). The CI signatures 
not only provide rapid, reliable detection of dropped 

control rods (35), but also clearly identify failed and 
failing thermocouples (45).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to a pressurized water
reactor having a safety system grade system for automatically
blocking withdrawal of control rods in response to a
dropped control rod.The reactivity of a pressurized water reactor is
controlled by regulating the concentration of a neutron
absorber, such as boron, in reactor coolant circulated
through the reactor core, and by control rods which can be
inserted into the reactor core. Changes in boron concentration
have a core wide effect while the insertion of
control rods is more localized. Typically, the control
rods are stepped into and out of the core, but can be
dropped into the core rapidly to shut down the core should
the need arise. It is possible that during normal operation
one or more individual control rod drives could
malfunction and drop control rods into the core. This
results in a reduction in the reactivity of the core with
consequent lowering of the average temperature of coolant
exiting the core. When this lowering of the average
temperature of the coolant exiting the core is detected by
the control system, about ten seconds after the actual rod
drop, the conventional control system responds to this
reduction in temperature by withdrawing specified control
rods in order to raise the core average temperature to a
set point level. This can result in excessive heat rise in 
another part of the core as the control system attempts to
compensate for the reduction in core reactivity.In a conventional pressurized water reactor,
regulation of the boron concentration is used to control
power level with the control rods being manipulated to
control power distribution during transients. Even when
load following with such a control strategy, only about
one-third of the control rods are inserted into the reactor
core at power. It has been analytically determined that
with such a control scheme, even in the worst case, a
dropped rod will not result in a dangerous over-temperature
condition in another part of the core. Hence, while a
dropped rod has an adverse effect on the operation of a
conventional reactor, it is not a critical safety item.Assignee of the present invention has developed an
advanced pressurized water reactor which is protected by
passive safety systems. That is, no operator intervention
is required to maintain safe operating conditions in the
reactor despite various postulated malfunctions. The
control strategy for this advanced pressurized water
reactor calls for load following primarily with the control
rods only and not through
