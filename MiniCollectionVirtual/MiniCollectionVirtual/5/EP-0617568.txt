<ABSTRACT>
A capacitor mounting structure for printed circuit 
boards wherein the capacitor includes first and second 

terminals (15a,15b) which are connected to first and second 
conductor planes (44,45) in the printed circuit board (B). Three 

vias (41,42,43) are mounted in the printed circuit board (B) in a 
position to be aligned with the middle of the 

capacitor. A first conductor pad (45) is mounted underneath 
one end of the capacitor and includes spaced apart 

extension portions (45b,45c) which electrically attach to the 
first (41) and third via (43). A second conductor pad (44) is mounted 

under the other end of the capacitor and includes a 
central extension portion (44b) which attaches to the second 

or middle via (42). In this manner, the region available 
for generation of parasitic inductance is minimized 

thereby increasing the operating efficiency of the 
capacitor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The field of this invention relates to the 
mounting structure for a capacitor onto a printed 
circuit board in order to minimize parasitic 
inductance. It is well known in the art of printed circuit 
board design to utilize capacitors to smooth the 
effects of sporadic current peaks and noise which is 
typical of electronic circuity. Theoretically, a 
capacitor has the characteristic of maintaining a 
substantially constant voltage while absorbing applied 
current changes, which is a typically important 
function in computer circuit design where current 
surges and peaks due to noise and the like must be 
smoothed to prevent interference with signal 
generation. In other words, capacitors are used to 
stabilize the supply voltage by compensating for abrupt 
current changes. However, due to the application of current across 
a capacitor, the capacitor generates an inductance 
called "parasitic" inductance. And, just as in the 
case of an inductor, such parasitic inductance can 
limit the rate of current change across the capacitor 
and thus cause the voltage to drop in spite of the 
presence of the capacitor. Further, such parasitic 
inductance can change the RF impedance characteristics 
of capacitors making them more complex elements in RF  
 
(radio frequency) applications, which makes design more 
complicated and performance objectives more difficult to 
achieve. Methods have been tried to reduce parasitic capacitor 
inductance. One method is to reduce the length of conductor 
traces extending between the capacitor terminal and the pad 
of a via. Another suggestion is the widening of capacitors 
and traces and shortening or eliminating traces from the 
capacitor pads to vias. However, there is a lower limit on 
capacitor lengths. For example, if a capacitor is too 
short, there is not enough space between the metalized 
contacts located at the ends of the capacitors and solder 
bridging to the metalized contacts or terminals becomes a 
problem. Capacitor shortening can also be difficult where 
board fabrication processes set the minimum space between 
vias, which dictates the minimum total length for the 
capacitor and the mounting structure combined. Increasing 
capacitor width at minimum length increases space occupied 
by the capacitor which uses more board space. In addition, 
there is a limit to the ratio of width to length in 
capacitor fabrication. Even with maximized capacitor width, 
within the practical range of capacitor and trace widths, 
inductance can only be reduced 30-40%. This
