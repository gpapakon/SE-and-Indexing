<CLAIMS>
Animated film recording camera with 

a camera housing (1) with a film recording beam path (18) 
wherein an object lens (3) is mounted on the front (2) of 

the housing, 
a viewfinder beam path (4) deflected from the film recording 
beam path (18) by means of a reflex system, 
a reflecting device (5) mounted in the viewfinder beam path 
(4) to divert the viewfinder beam path so that a viewfinder 

beam component (6) is reflected into a viewfinder outlet (7) 
on the front (2) of the camera housing (1), 
a magnifier arm (10) attached to the viewfinder outlet (7), 
an eyepiece support (11) attached to the magnifier arm (10) 

and to which is connected an eyepiece sight (12) of a viewer 
magnifier diverted towards the back of the camera housing 

(1) and adapted to swivel about the centre axis (8) of the 
viewfinder outlet (7) between the right and left side of the 

camera housing (1), 
 
characterised in that the reflecting system (5) which 

deflects the viewfinder path is designed as a partially 
permeable beam divider in order to branch off a video beam 

path (13) from the viewfinder beam path (4) and
 
that in the top side of the camera housing on the front side 

(2) there is a grip socket (15) of a camera handle (14) 
which is mounted rotatable therein wherein a video adaptor 

(16) is provided on the grip socket (15) and the video beam 
path (13) let through by the beam divider (5) is supplied to 

the adaptor through the grip socket (15). 
Animated film recording camera according to claim 1 
characterised in that in the operating position of the 

camera handle (14) the video beam path (13) exits the video 
adaptor (16) parallel to the lens (3).  

 
Animated film recording camera according to claim 1 or 
2 characterised in that between the viewfinder beam path (4) 

deflected by the reflex system out from the film recording 
beam path (18), and the beam divider (5) there is an optical 

twin reflex system (17), more particularly a rhomboid prism, 
which moves the viewfinder beam path (4) towards the front 

side (2) of the camera housing (1).
