<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to both thermal mass 
transfer processes and thermal dye transfer imaging. 
In particular the present invention relates to the use 
of a first thermal mass transfer coating on a substrate 
to provide a background surface having a desirable 
appearance and which is receptive to a thermally 
transferred dye. Thermal mass transfer and thermal dye transfer 
processes are technologies that bear some superficial 
similarities but which are distinct within the 
technical art. Both processes use a donor sheet and a 
receptor sheet. The thermal mass transfer donor sheet 
normally comprises a carrier layer with at least a 
thermally transferable colorant (a dye or preferably a 
pigment) in a heat softenable binder. The thermal dye 
transfer donor sheet comprises a carrier layer with at 
least a dye layer on the donor surface. The dye layer 
may consist of only dye or dye in a binder (the binder 
not transferring when the dye is thermally 
transferred). Both transfer sheets are used with the 
donor surface in intimate contact with a receptor 
material, and the donor sheet is heated in an imagewise 
manner (e.g., by thermal printheads, irradiation is by 
a laser or high intensity radiation transmitted through 
a mask or stencil) to transfer the image-forming 
material. In the thermal mass transfer system, the 
donor layer is softened by the imagewise heating (and 
sometimes a receptor layer on the receptor sheet is 
contemporaneously softened), and the softened area is  
 
transferred to the receptor sheet. In thermal dye 
transfer, the dye is melted or vaporized to transfer to 
the receptor sheet and tends to be adsorbed and/or 
absorbed into the surface of the receptor element. The 
nature of the mechanism of adherence of the transferred 
image to the receptor sheet makes the nature of the 
surface of that receptor sheet important for each of 
the imaging processes. Surfaces which work well for 
receiving mass transfer images do not necessarily work 
well for thermal dye transfer. It is also desirable in thermal dye transfer 
imaging to have greater image capability than 
conventional primary additive and subtractive colors. 
Thermal mass transfer has allowed for some use of more 
exotic colors and appearances by including fluorescent 
pigments and metallic pigments into the thermally 
transferred binders. There are no readily available 
metallic colors for use with dye transfer processes. U.S. Patent No. 4,472,479 (Hayes et al.) describes 
a light barrier fluorescent ribbon for

<CLAIMS>
A thermal mass transfer donor element comprising a substrate 
having coated thereon a first layer of a thermally mass transferrable white 

or shiny metallic pigment in a binder and adjacent to the first layer or 
between the first layer and the substrate a second layer comprising a clear 

mass transferable and dye receptive material. 
The donor element of claim 1 wherein said opaque white 
material comprises white metal oxides, white metal sulfates, or white metal 

carbonates. 
The donor element of claim 1 wherein the clear mass 
transferable and dye receptive layer comprises particulates and at least one 

of a wax-like substance and a polymeric resin having a softening 
temperature between 50 and 120Â°C. 
The donor element of claim 3 wherein the particules are silica. 
A process for providing a mixed thermal mass transfer and 
thermal dye transfer image on a receptor surface comprising thermal mass 

transferring a white or a shiny metallic image to a receptor surface, thermal 
mass transferring a clear dye receptive material to a receptor surface, and 

thermal dye transferring a dye to at least a part of the thermally mass 
transferred clear dye receptive material. 
The process of claim 5 wherein the white or shiny metallic 
image and the clear, dye receptive material are transferred from a single 

donor element. 
The process of claim 6 wherein the white or shiny metallic 
image and the clear, dye receptive material are transferred in a single mass 

transfer step. 
The element of claims 1, 2, 3 or 4 wherein said dye receptive 
binder be capable of absorbing at least one sublimable dye selected from the 

group of anthraquinone, azo, and sulfone dyes.
