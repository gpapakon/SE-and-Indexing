<ABSTRACT>
A process for the preparation of the unsaturated dinitroaniline, 
ethalfluralin, having a level of nitrosamines lower 

than 0.5 ppm and essentially free from the compound of 
addition of halogenhydric acid on the methallyl double-bond, 

by treatment with aqueous halogenhydric acid, wherein 
crude ethalfluralin is treated under agitation with an 

aqueous solution of hydrobromic acid in the presence of 
sulfamic acid and of a sulfur compound selected from the 

groups consisting of bisulfites, metabisulfites, hydrosulfites, 
sulfurous acid and gaseous sulfur dioxide.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for purifying 
crude ethalfluralin, which contains trace amounts of 
nitrosamines, in order to reduce their amount to a non-dangerous 
level and particularly to a value lower than 0.5 
ppm. Ethalfluralin is the commercial name of a herbicide, 
which is widely used in agriculture and whose chemical 
name is 4-trifluoromethyl-2,6-dinitro-N-ethyl-N-methallylaniline 
or (IUPAC) N-ethyl- alpha-alpha-alpha-trifluoro-N-(methylallyl)-2,6-dinitro-p-toluidine. Ethalfluralin belongs to a wide class of dinitro anilines 
having herbicidal activity and in such a class is 
characterized by the presence of an unsaturated methallyl 
or 2-methyl-2-propenyl group bound to the amino group. It is known that crude dinitroanilines contain small 
amounts of nitrosamines, typically from a few ppm to a few 
hundred ppm. It is assumed that the origin of nitrosamines 
in dinitroanilines derives from the final stage of their 
conventional preparation process, which consists of a reaction 
between the dinitro-chloro-benzene derivative with 
the desired secondary amine; the dinitro-chloro-benzene 
derivative may contain small amounts of nitrosating agents, 
such as nitrogen oxides which are present as the 
result of the nitration reaction, which may react with the 
amine to form the nitrosamines, whose presence in the dinitroanilines 
is considered undesirable due to the discovery 
of their carcinogenic properties in animals. Following the development of highly sensitive methods 
of analysis it is possible to ascertain the presence of  
 
nitrosamines in the dinitroanilines down to a level of 
0.02 ppm and the maximum value which is desired for their 
level in a commercial product is presently defined at 0.5 
ppm. In order to reduce the amount of nitrosamines, several 
purification processes have been proposed. Particularly, 
U.S. patent No.4,226,789 describes a process of treatment 
of dinitroanilines with HCl in an aqueous solution, 
with a concentration of at least 20% or with gaseous HCl 
under low pressure. With reference specifically to ethalfluralin, 
the cited U.S. patent teaches the need of using 
gaseous hydrochloric acid under pressure, since the use of 
an aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid causes addition 
reactions across the methallyl double-bond with the consequent 
formation of the chloro derivative and reduction of 
the title of ethalfluralin and of the overall process 
yield. Furthermore, the compound of addition of hydrochloric 
acid on ethalfluralin is stable and its
