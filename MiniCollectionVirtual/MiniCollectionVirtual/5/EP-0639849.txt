<ABSTRACT>
A discharge lamp assembly (200) compatible with a 
conventional filament type vehicle lamp has a discharge 

lamp (15), and a base structure (14) with a first base 
component (22) made of ceramics and a second base 

component (30) made of plastics. The first base component 
(22) has a cylindrical tube (16) having height (b) at 

center of the component (22) for accepting said lamp (15) 
together with a positive lead line (20) of the lamp into 

the hole (22b) under said cylindrical tube (16), a hole 
(19) at side of the component (22) for accepting a 

negative lead line (17) of the lamp, and a slit (22d) 
between said holes (22b, 19). A first partition wall (21) 

is provided between said slit (22d) and said hole (22b). 
The second base component (30) has a circular flange (24) 

and a hollow housing (24b) under said flange (24) which 
engages with said first base component (22). A second 

partition wall (29) is provided in said housing (24b) so 
that said second partition wall (29) engages with said 

slit (22d) of the first base component (22) when 
assembled. Said cylindrical tube (16), first partition 

wall (21) and second partition wall (29) function to 
increase insulation length (X1, X2) between a positive 

lead line and a negative lead line to ensure withstand 
voltage higher than 20000 V.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a discharge lamp 
assembly, in particular, relates to a base structure of 
the lamp assembly of a discharge lamp for feeding electric 
power to the lamp. The present invention relates to such a 
base structure in which a discharge lamp in which a base is 
mounted operates with higher than 20000 volts with no 
leakage due to undesirable discharge in air and along the 
base structure itself. The present lamp assembly is 
preferably used in a head lamp of a vehicle. Preferably, a 
discharge lamp having the present base structure is 
compatible with a conventional type socket which is used 
in a conventional filament type lamp in a head light 
assembly for a vehicle. A filament type lamp using tungsten filament has been 
used for a head light lamp in a vehicle. Lately, a so-called projector type or ellipsoid head 
light using a halogen lamp (for instance, an iodine lamp) 
which has advantages to prevent a lamp wall blackened by 
halogen cycle and to have long life of a filament has been 
used in a head light of a vehicle. The lamp is almost a 
point light source, which is accompanied by a reflector 
for condensing light.  
 A technical standard has been determined for such a 
projector type nead light. Some of them are PE 
(Polyellipsoid), and DE (three-dimentional ellipsoid), in 
which structure and dimension of a base or a connector are 
defined for each halogen lamp (H-1 type, or H-7 type, HB-3 
type and/or HB-4 type, et al). A prior halogen lamp for a projector type head light 
is supplied with electric power of 12 volts, consumes 
50-100 watts, having the light conversion efficiency 20-23 
lm/W, and average life time 500 hours. Fig.8 shows the structure of a prior halogen lamp 
assembly 100 (H-1 type), and a socket 8 of a projector 
type head light for accepting said lamp assembly 100. In the figure, the lamp assembly 100 has a halogen 
lamp 1, which is fixed to a base 2 through a column 3. The 
numeral 4 is a flange for fixing the lamp assembly 100 to 
the socket 8, and 5 is an electrode for feeding electric 
power to the lamp 1. The halogen lamp 1 operates with low 
voltage around 12 volts, therefore, no specific 
consideration for insulation is necessary. The base 2 of 
the lamp 1 has a column 3 made of plastics, and a flange 4 
made of conductive material which doubles as a negative 
electrode. A socket assembly 7 has a socket 8 which has a 
conductive bottom plate 8a. The bottom plate 8a has a hole 
9 to which the lamp 1 and the column 3 pass, and a pair of 
small
