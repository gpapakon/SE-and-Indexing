<ABSTRACT>
Coryneform bacteria promoter DNA fragments are disclosed 
having greater promoter strength in Coryneform bacteria cells 

than the tac promoter obtained by fusing 
Escherichia coli
 trp 
promoter and lac promoter. The promoter function of some of 

the promoter DNA fragments is controllable by replacing at 
least one of the culture-medium ingredients with at least one 

other ingredient. The sizes and nucleotide sequences of such 
promoter DNA fragments are also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a promoter DNA fragment
originating from chromosomal DNA of a coryneform bacterium.Coryneform bacteria are Gram-positive bacteria widely
used for industrial-scale production of a variety of products
including amino acids, such as glutamic acid and aspartic
acid; and purine nucleotides, such as inosinic acid, etc.
However, compared with Escherichia coli, coryneform bacteria
have not been extensively bred by using recombinant DNA
techniques. To fully utilize the recombinant DNA techniques
for breeding of coryneform bacteria, a vector must be
developed useful for industrial-scale gene manipulation in
coryneform bacteria. More particularly, a promoter DNA
fragment of such a vector must be developed, i.e., a promoter
having a strong gene-expression function or a promoter whose
gene-expression function is controllable.Improvement of promoter function in coryneform bacteria
has been reported by using promoters originating from
Escherichia coli. The Journal of Biotechnology, 5, 305,
(1987) and Gene, 102, 93, (1991) state that a tac promoter
(Gene, 20, 231 (1982)) obtained by fusing a protein of trp
promoter and lac promoter both originating from Escherichia
coli achieved a greater constitutive promoter strength in
coryneform bacteria than any other promoter examined so far.WO 92/03546 is directed to a method for expressing bacterial hemoglobin in Coryneform
bacteria using trp, lac or tac promotors.EP 530 765 relates to a DNA fragment from Coryneform bacteria which regulates
expression of a structural gene.As far as the inventors know, no promoter has since been
developed that achieves a greater promoter strength in
coryneform bacteria than the tac promoter.A method for controlling the expression of a gene of
interest in a coryneform bacterium is described in 
Bio/Technology, 6, 428, (1988), in which a controllable
promoter originating from Escherichia coli is incorporated
into a coryneform bacterium without modifying the promoter.
However, this gene-expression control method fails to achieve
a level of expression of a gene of interest in the host
coryneform bacterium comparable to the level that is achieved
by the same promoter in Escherichia coli.In developing a system for manipulating the expression of
cloned genes in coryneform bacteria for which no such system
exists, it is desirable to begin by isolating a variety of
different promoter elements with different functional
properties. Functional properties of interest may indicate
whether a promoter is one which is repressed
