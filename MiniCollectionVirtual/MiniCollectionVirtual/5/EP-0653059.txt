<ABSTRACT>
An integrated monolithic gas sensor comprises a substrate and thin films deposited on this substrate. The thin films include a thin film electrically conductive heating element, a thin film conductive reference electrode, and a second thin film conductive electrode, these electrodes and heating element being electrically isolated from each other. A thin film ionic conductor and a thin film reactive gas sensitive layer are placed between the reference electrode and the second conductive electrode to form an electrolytic cell in which an electrolytic reaction including as reagent the gas to be detected produces between the two conductive electrodes an electromotive force indicative of the concentration of the gas. Also deposited is a micro-thermometer formed of a thin film wire having a temperature-dependent resistance. When the gas to be detected is CO2, the ionic conductor may comprise NASICON of formula Na3Zr2Si2PO12, and the reactive gas sensitive layer may comprise Na2CO3.

 THIN FILM GAS SENSOR ANDMETHOD OF FABRICATION THEREOFBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the invention:The present invention relates to an integrated monolithic thin film gas sensor capable of continuously detecting and monitoring low concentration of gas with a sensitivity of 100 p.p.m. or less. The present invention further relates to a method of fabricating this sensor, with thin film fabrication techniques.2. Brief description of the prior art:Many techniques have been proposed for detecting concentrations of gases such as C02 in the air. For example, spectroscopic techniques including infrared and photoacoustic spectroscopies carry out detection through electronic transitions produced in the gas when illuminated. Another example is concerned with an electrochemical cell provided with an electrode chemically sensitive to the gas to be sensed. The gas sensors that have been constructed on the basis of these prior art techniques are bulky, fragile, not integrable with the electronic circuit through which they are controlled, and, generally, 

they are not adapted to inexpensive mass production. In particular, spectroscopic sensors are as a whole expensive and quite fragile.Another prior art gas sensor is described in U.S. patent NÂ° 4,668,374 granted to Bhagat et al. on May 26, 1987. More specifically, this patent discloses a fast response gas sensor fabricated through microelectronics technology to form multiple thin film solid-electrolyte pump and sense cells within a hermetically sealed sensor cavity. This prior art sensor requires an airtight chamber which must be free of any chemical and any source of current leakage. The electrolyte is in the form of a membrane, and the response time is related to the thickness of the electrolyte, and thus to the thickness of the membrane. To obtain very fast response times, the membrane of the electrolyte must be so thin that it suffers from mechanical integrity; the resulting membrane is fragile and can rupture easily in normal service to render the sensor inoperative. Moreover, the sensor of Bhagat et al. is designed to be used in an ambient temperature of 300 "C, and comprises an ionic conductor which, at that temperature, has a sufficient conductivity and does not suffer from interference due to water adsorbed at the surface of the sensor. Therefore, a drawback of the sensor of Bhagat et al. is that it cannot be used at room temperature. Also, nothing is disclosed regarding methods to increase sensitivity of the gas detection, or to integrate the sensor
