<ABSTRACT>
A non-reciprocal optical device comprising a Faraday 
device made of a rare-earth iron garnet single crystal 

which can be in a magnetically saturated condition of 
Faraday rotation angle without an external magnetic field. 

Since a permanent magnet is omitted, the size of optical 
isolator or optical circulator can be more reduced than 

before. In addition, since the number of parts of the 
optical isolator or the optical circulator is reduced, the 

fabrication cost thereof can be reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a non-reciprocal 
optical device such as an optical isolator or an optical 
circulator composed of a rare-earth iron garnet single 
crystal. More specifically, the present invention relates 
to an optical isolator or an optical circulator that does 
not use a permanent magnet. Since a rare-earth iron garnet single crystal that is 
for example yttrium iron garnet [Y₃Fe₅O₁₂) and a bismuth 
substituted rare-earth iron garnet single crystal 
[(RBi)₃Fe₃O₁₂, R is yttrium or a rare-earth element], where 
a portion of the rare-earth element is substituted with 
bismuth, have high transparent characteristic and large 
Faraday effect in near infrared region, they have been used 
and intensively developed for Faraday devices for non-reciprocal 
optical devices such as optical isolators and 
optical circulators and Faraday devices for optical 
magnetic field sensors for detecting the presence and/or 
the intensity of magnetic field. The Faraday effect is a kind of magneto-optical effect 
and refers to the phenomenon where a polarization plane of 
light that has transmitted through a material having 
Faraday effect, that is, a Faraday device (Faraday rotator) 
rotates. The rotation angle of the polarization plane is 
proportional to the intensity of the magnetization of the 
Faraday device as shown in Fig. 1.  In Fig. 1, when an external magnetic field is not 
applied, (namely, the intensity of the magnetic field is 
zero), the Faraday's rotation angle of the Faraday rotator 
is zero, namely present at the origin o. When the external magnetic field is gradually 
strengthened, the absolute value (ϑF or -ϑF, where 
clockwise rotation and counterclockwise rotation are 
normally denoted by + and -, respectively) of the Faraday's 
rotation angle gradually increases through path a or path d 
(path o -> a -> b or path o -> d -> e). When the intensity 
of the external magnetic field becomes a predetermined 
intensity [Hs], the Faraday rotation angle becomes a 
saturated value (saturated magnetic field, point b or point 
e in Fig. 1). When the intensity of the external magnetic 
field further increases, since the Faraday rotation angle 
has been already saturated, the Faraday rotation angle does 
not vary, with movement from point b to c or from point e 
to f. When the intensity of the external magnetic field is 
gradually weakened, the Faraday rotation angle decreases 
through path c -> b -> a -> o or path f -> e -> d -> o. 
Thus, finally, since there becomes no influence due to the 
external
