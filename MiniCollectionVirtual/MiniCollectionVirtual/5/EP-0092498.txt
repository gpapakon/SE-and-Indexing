<ABSTRACT>
A pneumatic tire (10) has a tread reinforcement structure 
(12) with a first tread-reinforcing ply (32) folded around a 

second tread-reinforcing ply (40), such that the first tread 
reinforcing ply envelops the second tread-reinforcing ply. The 

reinforcing elements of the second tread-reinforcing ply form 
an angle of substantially zero degrees with respect to the mid-­

circumferential plane of the tire, and the reinforcing elements 
of the first tread-reinforcing ply form an angle in the range of 

about 20 degrees to about 60 degrees with respect to the mid-­
circumferential plane of the tire.

TREAD   REINFORCEMEHT      ,TF{UCTURE    FOR PNEUMATIC TIRES
 Background of the Invention
 The present invention relates to pneumatic tires, and more particularly to tread-reinforcement structures for pneumatic tires.


 The present invention relates to a tread reinforcement structure for a pneumatic tire, wherein one treadreinforcing ply is folded around a second tread-reinforcing ply. The tread-reinforcing elements of the second treadreinforcing ply are oriented at a substantially zero degree angle with respect to the mid-circumferential plane of the tire. Tread-reinforcement structures for radial tires having one tread-reinforcing ply folded around another tread-reinforcing ply are well known in the tire, design and manufacturing technologies. Such tread-reinforcement structures are known to have the advantages of improved high-speed performance characteristics and improved resistance to separations at the axial edges of the treadreinforcement structure.
For instance, U.   S,    Patent 3,093,181, issued to Beckadolph, teaches that a first tread-reinforcing ply, in which the reinforcing elements are substantially perpendicular to the mid-circumferential plane of a tire, may be folded around a second treadreinforcing ply having its reinforcing elements oriented at a   substantially,zero-degree    angle with respect to the mid-circumferential plane of the tire.
However, a treadreinforcement structure made in accordance with the present invention has a first tread-reinforcing ply having its reinforcing elements oriented at an angle in the range of about 20 degrees to about   6o    degrees with respect to the mid-circumferential plane of the tire, folded around the edges of a second tread-reinforcing ply having its reinforcing elements oriented at substantially zero degrees with respect to the mid-circumferential plane of the tire. A tire having a tread-reinforcement structure constructed in accordance with the present invention has an improved resistance   vo      penetration    by a  foreign obJect.
The resistance of a tire to penetration, in a radial direction, by a foreign   object,    is referred to herein as the   tire 1#    "plunger energy", which shall mean the amount of energy required for a foreign obJect to penetrate the crown region of a tire in a radial direction. Increased plunger energy can be especially beneficial in radial ply truck tires, which are often subjected to rough road conditions, such as pot-holes, and foreign objects lying on roadways, that subject the tread portion of the

   #ThAT    IS CLAIMED IS:



 1. A pneumatic tire comprising:
 (a) a carcass having a crown region (20);

 (b) a tread portion (30) disposed circumferentially about said crown region; and
 (c) a tread-reinforcement structure (12) disposed circumferentially between said carcass and said tread portion, said reinforcement structure characterized by:

   (i)    a first tread-reinforcing ply (32) of parallel reinforcing elements, said reinforcing elements forming an angle of between about 20 degrees and about 60 degrees relative to the mid-circumferential plane of said tire, said first tread-reinforcing ply having a central portion and two axial edge portions, said axial edge portions being folded radially outwardly and axially inwardly to meet, but not abut, at the mid-circumferential plane of said tire;

 and
 (ii) a second tread-reinforcing ply (40) of at least one circumferential layer of parallel reinforcing elements, said reinforcing elements forming an angle of between about zero degrees and about 10 degrees relative to the mid-circumferential plane of said tire, said second tread-reinforcing ply having a width, with respect to the axis of rotation of said tire, that is substantially the same as that of the central portion of said first tread-reinforcing ply, said second tread-reinforcing ply being interposed circumferentially between the central portion and axial edge portions of said first tread-reinforcing ply.




 2. A pneumatic tire according to Claim 1, further characterized in that said tread portion comprises a replaceable tread band, and said  tread-reinforcement structure is integral to said replaceable tread band.



 3. A pneumatic tire according to Claim 1 or 2, further characterized in that the axial edge portions of said first tread-reinforcing ply (32) overlap at the mid-circumferential plane of said tire.



 4. A pneumatic tire according to Claim 1 or 2, further characterized in that the axial edge portions of said first tread-reinforcing ply (232) are spaced apart, with respect to the axis of rotation of said tire, and said tread-reinforcement structure (12) further comprising a third tread-reinforcing ply (244) of parallel reinforcing elements, the reinforcing elements of said third reinforcing ply forming an angle of between about 20 degrees to about 60 degrees relative to the mid-circumferential plane of said tire, said third tread-reinforcing ply being disposed circumferentially, radially outward of said second tread-reinforcing ply (240), said third tread-reinforcing ply having first and second axial edges that are adjacent to, but not overlapping, the axial edges of said first tread-reinforcing ply.

 


 5. A pneumatic tire according to Claim 1, 2, 3, or 4, further characterized in that said carcass is a radial ply carcass.



 6. A pneumatic tire according to Claim 1, 2, or 3, further characterized in that the reinforcing elements of said first and second tread-reinforcing plies are metallic wires or cables.



 7. A pneumatic tire according to Claim 4, further characterized in that the reinforcing elements of said first (232), second   (240)-,    and third (242) tread-reinforcing plies are metallic wires or cables.
