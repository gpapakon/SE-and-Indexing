<ABSTRACT>
The capacitive sensor (1) comprises a linear or curvilinear network of electrodes (10) and means generating a spatially periodic electric potential distribution on these electrodes (10), which distribution moves in steps of constant transition from one or more electrodes along this network. The electrodes (10) are in turn disconnected from the said means in order to become receivers. The distribution, which is also spatially periodic, of the instantaneously receiving electrodes (10R) moves with the same transition steps. The two distributions move alternately, the transitions of one distribution therefore taking place in the intervals between the transitions of the other. A linear or curvilinear rule (2) seated facing the sensor and formed by a spatially periodic network of electrodes (20) or a dielectric or conductive relief, will thus create a periodic fluctuation of the signal on the instantaneously receiving electrodes. Evaluation of the phase of this demodulated signal then makes it possible precisely to determine the relative position between the rule (2) and the sensor (1). Given that the sensor can be integrated in a semiconductor circuit and the rule (2) may be very narrow, it is possible by virtue of the invention to provide instruments with a very high degree of miniaturisation and a low cost price.
