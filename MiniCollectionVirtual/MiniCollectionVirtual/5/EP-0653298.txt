<ABSTRACT>
An armoured and bulletproof glass (glazing), designed for motor vehicles and consisting of several sheets of silicate glass (16, 17, 18 and 19), these being combined together and separated by thermoplastic interlayers (20, 21 and 22), includes a sheet of silicate glass (16) having a high absorptivity in the spectral band lying between 780 and 1200 nm. This sheet of silicate glass (16), or one of the other sheets which make up the armoured glass (17, 18 and 19), is also provided on one of its faces with a semireflective surface coating (23) having a high reflectivity for light rays whose wavelength lies between 780 and 1200 nm. The armoured glass thus possesses overall a transparency of less than 15% and, preferably, less than 10%, within the spectral band mentioned hereinabove. This type of armoured and structured glass offers a high degree of security in the case of night driving, since they also prove to be opaque for night vision equipment.

Armoured, bullet-proof window constituted by several glass sheets
(1, 2, 3, 16, 17, 18, 19) and complying with DIN standard 52290, more

particularly intended for cars, characterized in that at least one sheet
(1, 16) is provided with a film, which reflects wavelengths between 780

and 1200 nm in such a way that the armoured, bullet-proof window has a
total transparency below 15%, particularly below 10%, in that part of the

light spectrum between 780 and 1200 nm.
Armoured, bullet-proof window constituted by several glass sheets
(8, 9, 10, 11, 16, 17, 18, 19) and complying with DIN standard 52290, more

particularly intended for cars, characterized in that at least one of the
constituent sheets (8, 16) is made from an absorbing glass for wavelengths

between 780 and 1200 nm, so that the armoured, bullet-proof window has a
total transparency below 15%, particularly below 10%, in that part of the

light spectrum between 780 and 1200 nm.
Armoured, bullet-proof window constituted by several glass sheets
(16, 17, 18, 19) and complying with DIN standard 52290, more particularly

intended for cars, characterized in that at least one sheet (16) is provided
with a film reflecting wavelengths between 780 and 1200 nm and that

at least one of the constituent sheets (16) is of an absorbing glass for
wavelengths between 780 and 1200 nm, so that the armoured, bullet-proof

window has a total transparency below 150%, particularly below 10%, in that
part of the light spectrum between 780 and 1200 nm.
Armoured, bullet-proof window according to claims 1 or 3, whereof the
surface film (6, 23) reflecting for wavelengths between 780 and 1200 nm is

constituted by a multilayer film obtained by vacuum deposition and having
at least one silver-based functional film.
Armoured, bullet-proof window according to claim 1, 3 or 4, characterized
in that the silver-based functional film is comprised in a multilayer

film chosen from among the following sequences: ZnO-Ag-ZnO, ZnO-Ag-ZnO-Ag-ZnO,

Armoured, bullet-proof window according to one of the claims 1, 3, 4
or 5, whereof the surface film (6, 23) reflecting for wavelengths between

780 and 1200 nm is placed on the surface turned towards the inside of the
outermost sheet (1, 16).
Armoured, bullet-proof window according to one of the claims 1 to 6,
whereof the face oriented towards the inside of the vehicle is provided

with one or more polymer films preventing its shattering in the case of
bullet impact.
Armoured, bullet-proof window according to one of the claims 1 to 7 and
also having on the face oriented towards the outside another sheet placed

in front of the laminated glass window and defining a spacing air layer.
