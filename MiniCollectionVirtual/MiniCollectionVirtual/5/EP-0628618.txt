<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a silicone 
pressure-sensitive adhesive composition. More particularly, 
the invention relates to an oxime-functional hot melt 
adhesive which cures upon exposure to ambient moisture. Silicone pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSAs) 
typically contain at least two primary components, namely a 
linear siloxane polymer and a tackifier resin. The resin 
consists of triorganosiloxane (M) units (i.e., R3SiO1/2 
units, in which R denotes a monovalent organic group) and 
silicate (Q) units (i.e., SiO4/2 units). Additionally, 
silicone PSA compositions are generally provided with some 
crosslinking means (e.g., peroxide or hydrosilation cure 
systems) in order to optimize various properties of the final 
adhesive product. In view of the high viscosity imparted by 
the polymer component, PSA compositions are typically 
dispersed in an organic solvent for ease of application. The prior art is represented by EP-A2 0 529 841; 
US-A 4,143,088; US-A 4,865,920; US-A 5,013,781; US-A 
5,091,484; JP-A 51-404,858 and JP-A 04-81,487. With the current emphasis on the control of 
volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions, the use of 
conventional PSAs is losing favor and there is an ever 
growing need for PSAs which contain little or no solvent. 
Furthermore, many applications require that an essentially 
instant bond be formed between parts so that the parts can be 
transported or otherwise manipulated without waiting for a 
solvent to evaporate or the composition to cure. This 
characteristic is defined herein as "green strength" and is 
manifested by high initial adhesive strength of the PSA.  
 The above needs are simultaneously addressed by the 
PSA compositions of the present invention. Our claimed 
compositions have a high level of instant tack and green 
strength as well as being essentially solvent-free. 
Additionally, the PSAs disclosed herein are non-slump solids 
under ambient conditions, but can be heated to a flowable 
liquid state and applied to substrates by methods now 
employed to dispense "hot melt" organic adhesives. Further, 
the instant PSAs, which can be stored as one-part systems for 
extended periods, cure to essentially non-tacky elastomers 
when exposed to moisture, the cured composition providing an 
even stronger bond than its corresponding green strength 
value. Unlike compositions which remain PSAs after cure, the 
compositions of our invention can be handled after curing. 
They also exhibit limited dirt pick-up and contamination when 
an excess of the material
