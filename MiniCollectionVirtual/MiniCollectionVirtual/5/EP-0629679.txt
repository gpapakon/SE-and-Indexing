<ABSTRACT>
A cyclone roof (12) has an aperture (10) and an 
outlet tube (22) extends through the aperture. A ring 

plate member (16) overlies the roof and its opening has a 
diameter smaller than the diameter of the roof aperture. 

The opening has an erosion protective covering (18) and 
defines a ware-resistant annular vent orifice (24) between 

the protective covering (18) and the outlet tube (22).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to the formation
of a vent orifice in fluid catalytic cracking direct-connected
cyclone apparatus.Our published European patent application no.
EP-A-0488549, the disclosure of which is incorporated
herein by reference, describes an apparatus for rapidly
separating catalyst from a cracked hydrocarbon gas in a
fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC) unit. It also
describes a process for withdrawing stripper gas from an
FCC reactor vessel. A feature of the described invention
is the location of the vent orifice for reactor and
stripper gasses in an annular space formed around the
reactor cyclone outlet tube through the roof of the
reactor cyclone. This location for the vent orifice has
been shown to have a technical advantage over systems
practised by others in the operation and pressure balance
of direct-connected cyclone systems.In the direct-connected cyclone system the vent
orifice may serve as an expansion connection between the
first stage reactor cyclone and the second stage or upper
cyclone. In this 
case, freedom of movement between the reactor cyclone outlet tube
and cyclone roof must be maintained. Sizing of the vent orifice
and maintenance of the vent orifice clearance is critical to
maintaining proper operation of the direct-connected cyclone
during an extended run on an FCCU. The tolerances required to
maintain the proper pressure balance in the system are very
small. For example, in one system, the width of the annular gap
of the vent orifice is only about 20mm. In some designs it may
be necessary to provide for lateral expansion which exceeds the
width of the gap between the cyclone outlet tube and cyclone
roof. In other words, when the gap is designed for the proper
pressure drop, there may not be enough clearance to provide for
lateral expansion.The process of fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) comprises
mixing hot regenerated catalyst with a hydrocarbon feedstock in a
transfer line riser reactor under catalytic cracking reaction
conditions. The feedstock is cracked to yield gasoline boiling
range hydrocarbon as well as degradation products, such as coke
which deposits on the catalyst causing a reduction in catalytic
activity. Hydrocarbon vapor and coked catalyst are passed from
the top of the riser reactor directly to a separator vessel,
typically a cyclone separator, wherein catalyst is separated from
hydrocarbon. In the FCC art, the separator vessel is termed the
reactor vessel. The separated catalyst is passed to a stripper 
wherein it is contacted with a
