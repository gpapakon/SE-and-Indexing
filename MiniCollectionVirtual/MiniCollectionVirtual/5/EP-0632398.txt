<ABSTRACT>
An object (10) to be checked has a scanning region (17) 
which contains a large number of magnetic elements (12) 

scattered at random. Each of the magnetic elements (12) is 
made up of an element main body formed of a high molecular 

material, and magnetic metal powder contained in the 
element main body. A processing apparatus (20) employed 

for checking whether or not the object (10) is authentic 

has a magnetic sensor (30) which is made up of a pair of MR 
elements (31,32) and a magnet (33). The MR elements 

(31,32) are arranged side by side in the direction in 
which the scanning region (17) is scanned. In the manufacturing 

process of the object (10), a detection signal 
which is based on variations in the output ratio between 

the MR elements (31,32) is produced, with the scanning 
region (17) of the object (10) being moved. The detection 

signal is converted into a cipher code, and this cipher 
code is recorded in a code indicator section. When the 

object (10) is checked for authenticity, a detection signal 
obtained by scanning the scanning region (17) is 

collated with the cipher code recorded in the code 
indicator section. When the detection signal and the 

cipher code agree with each other, the object (10) is determined 
as being authentic.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and
apparatus for checking objects which should be
prevented from being forged and are to be checked for
authenticity, such as important documents, securities,
paper money, checks, travelers' checks, bank cards, prepaid
cards, ID cards, CD cards, credit cards, passports,
admission tickets, art objects, and betting tickets for
public-managed gambling games.A checking method and apparatus utilizing microwaves
are known in the art as measures for checking the
authenticity of documents or the like, as described in
PCT National Publication No. 63-501250 (U.S. Patent
No. 4,820,912). According to this publication, on which the two
part form of the independent claims is based, microwaves
are applied to a large number of metallic wires
which are embedded and scattered at random in a
document, and a proper digital mark responsive to a
response microwave bundle is recorded in a suitable
region of the document according to specific rules. To
check the authenticity of the document, microwaves are
applied to the document, and a response microwave bundle
is collated with the digital mark. The document is
determined as being authentic when the microwave bundle
and the digital mark agree with each other.The checking means which utilizes microwaves, as in
the apparatus of the above publication, has problems in
that the measurement of a response microwave bundle is 
susceptible to external noise, and the signal-to-noise
ratio (S/N ratio) is lowered thereby. In addition, the
apparatus of the publication may constitute a source of
noise since it oscillates microwaves. Further, a
microwave transmitter and a microwave receiver are
generally large in size and entail high costs.In the conventional art, a mark is recorded on a
predetermined part of paper money in magnetic ink, so as
to identify the denomination of the paper money. To be
more specific, the same mark is recorded on the
predetermined part of the bills or notes of the same
denomination. If the mark is detected and known, it can
be easily forged. This being so, the mark recorded on
paper money in magnetic ink is not very useful in
preventing forgery.Document JP 6096294 which represents prior art
according to Art. 54(3) EPC discloses anillegal use
preventing method for a magnetic card. In this method, a
magnetic stripe and a printing part containing magnetic
material are formed on the card. In order to verify the
authenticity of the card, a detecting signal of the
printing part is compared with a recording signal of the
magneti
