<DESCRIPTION>
Title: DRIVE SYSTEM WITH FREEWHEEL CLUTCHThis invention relates to a drive system comprising at least one drive source delivering its power by means of a driving, rotation-and-torque transmitting element, at least one speed variator and at least one driven, rotation-and- torque receiving element.Such a device is known for instance as a drive of a passenger car in which the coupling between the wheels and th drive source is formed inter alia by a continuously variable transmission. In general, when, via a speed variator, a driving, rotation-and-torque transmitting element, such as a drive shaft of a drive source, is to be coupled to a driven, rotation-and-torque receiving element, such as a central output shaft, this necessitates the provision of fluid clutches, slip clutches, gearboxes, freewheel clutches and th like so as to tune the speed of the driving element to the speed of the driven element before a coupling is effected. Apart from the fact that power is lost in these parts as a result of heat development and friction, it is impossible, in the absence of these parts, for the speed of the driven element to be regulated steplessly from zero revolutions per second to a maximum value, nor can the driving element be varied from zero rotations per second.One object of the invention is to provide a drive system in which the speed of the driving element is independent of the speed of the driven element and the speed of the driven element can be varied from zero revolutions per second to a maximum value, independently of the speed of the driving element. These conditions must apply throughout the entire control range of the drive system, i.e., from zero speed to a maximum value. A further object of the invention is to provid a drive system in which all driving elements are at all times dynamically coupled to all driven elements, i.e., a drive system without friction, fluid or similar conventional in/out clutches. 

 To that end, the drive system of the type described in the opening paragraph hereof is characterized according to the invention in that, for distributing power originating from one drive source over several driven elements and/or for combining power originating from several drive sources on a driven, rotation-and-torque receiving, single element, the or each speed variator is designed as an infinitely variable, slipless freewheel clutch having an input and an output shaft, the input shaft being provided with at least one pair of eccentric discs whose eccentricity can be varied, also during
