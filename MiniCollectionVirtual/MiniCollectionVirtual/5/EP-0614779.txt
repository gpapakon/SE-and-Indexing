<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a control board (dashboard) with integrated illumination. The control board (10) comprises a front panel (12) making at least one circular opening (62), a rotary control button (40) housed in the circular opening, a light source (38) placed behind the front panel and markers (64) on the front panel and/or the control button which are sensitive to the light emitted by the source, the control button (50) being fitted with a peripheral circular groove (58) into which penetrates a circular rib (60) attached to the front panel (12) and surrounding the circular opening (62), which makes it possible to prevent light from passing between the front panel and the control button. Application to motor vehicles.

A control panel comprising a front panel (12)
defining at least one circular aperture (62), a rotary

control knob (40) mounted in the circular aperture, a
light source (38) placed behind the front panel, and

markings (64) carried by the front panel and/or the
control knob and sensitive to the light emitted by the

source, the control knob being provided with a circular
peripheral groove (58) into which there penetrates a

circular rib (60) attached to the front panel (12) and
surrounding the circular aperture (62), characterised

in that the circular peripheral groove (58) is concave
towards the front, on the side opposite to the light

source (38), while the circular rib (60) extends
backwards on the same side as the light source (38),

whereby to prevent the light from passing between the
front panel (12) and the control knob (40).
A control panel according to Claim 1, characterised
in that the groove (58) and the rib are of a material

absorbent or reflective to light, or coated with such a
material.
A control panel according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, in
which the control knob (40) comprises a cylindrical

shroud (54) characterised in that the circular
peripheral groove (58) is defined by an outwardly

rolled edge portion (56) which extends the cylindrical
shroud. 
A control panel according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the circular peripheral groove

(58) has a base with a semicircular cross section.
A control panel according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the circular rib (60) extends in

a direction substantially at right angles with respect
to the front panel (12).
A control panel according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the circular peripheral groove

(58) and the circular rib (60) define between them a
maximum clearance (j) of 1 mm.
A control panel according to one of Claims 1 to 6,
comprising a light box (22) on which the front panel

(12) is mounted, characterised in that the front panel
(12) is installed on the light box (22) already

equipped with the knob (40), the circular rib (60) of
the front panel (12) being caused during the fitting

operation to penetrate into the circular peripheral
groove (58) of the control knob (40).
