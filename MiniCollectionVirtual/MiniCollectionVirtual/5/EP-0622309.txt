<ABSTRACT>
A transporting container with a cover (4), which is provided with gripping strips, and a food box (5) for transporting previously prepared meals which can be hot or cold. The basic body (1) of the transporting container is polygonal with plug-on closures (2, 6) on the outer walls and peripheral foot strips (3) at the bottom. The food box (5) made of porcelain stands in the basic body (1) and the basic body (1) is closed by means of a press-in cover (4). The press-in cover (4) has cutouts (12) on its inner side which guarantee tight sealing of the food box (5) and cutouts (13) on the top surface which guarantee the stackability of the transporting containers one above the other.

Stackable angular transport container consisting of a body (1) with a cover (4), at
least one foodbox (5) capable of being accomodated in the interior of the body (1)

to transport previously prepared food, and a base batten (3) arranged at the bottom
of the body, which can engage with an indentation (11) on the top of the cover (4)

with the said cover (4) designed as a press cover, which has indentations (12) at its
bottom which interact with the foodbox (5), and projections (2) holding the cover

(4) in indentations of the body (1),

characterized in that

the base batten (3) runs around the bottom of the body (1),
the body (1) has plug-in locks (6) on its outer surfaces,
the foodbox (5) being open on top is preferably of a light china, and
the cover (4) is provided with handle bars,

whereby the said projections (2) of the cover (4) can engage with indentations provided
on the inner surface of the body (1) with a distance from its opening, and in

the engaged position of the cover (4), the highest rims of the foodbox (5) or the
foodbox (5) engage with the indentations (12) on the bottom of the cover (4) so that

the transport container is closed heat- and odour-insulatedly.
Stackable angular transport container according to claim 1, characterized in that

the foodbox (5) is divided into food reception areas separated from each other by
an arrangement of lands (14) with a height equal to that of the rim of the foodbox

(5).
Stackable angular transport container according to claims 1 to 2, characterized in
that


on the inner bottom of the body (1) there is a separating land (8) arranged such
that a first foodbox (5) and a second foodbox (7) are transported side by side in a

non-skidding way, and
the indentation (12) provided on the bottom and interior surface of the cover (4) is
adapted to the sum of the wall thicknesses of the first foodbox (5), second foodbox 

(7) and separating land (8), and the cover (4) heat- and odour-insulatingly closes the
transport container with several foodboxes arranged side by side.
Stackable angular transport container according to claims 1 to 2, characterized in
that


in the body (1) at least two foodboxes (5) are transported on top of each other
with the lower foodbox (5) closed by means of a press cover (9), which similar to

the cover (4) is provided with projections (2) which can engage with indentations,
and has on the top an indentation (13) with which the bottom of an upper foodbox

(5) matches, and
the uppermost foodbox (5) and the body (1) are heat- and odour-insulatingly closed
by means of the cover (4).
Stackable angular transport container according to claims 3 and 4, characterized in
that


in the body (1) first and second foodboxes (5, 7) are side by side and, in the same
time, at least two foodboxes (5, 7) are on top of each other, whereby at least one

press cover (9) heat- and odour-insulatingly closes foodboxes (5, 7) arranged on top
of each other, and
the uppermost foodboxes (5, 7) and the body (1) are closed heat- and odour-insulatedly
by means of the cover (4).
