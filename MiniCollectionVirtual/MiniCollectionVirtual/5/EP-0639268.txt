<DESCRIPTION>
TITLE: IMPROVED ENZYME ELECTRODESThis is a continuation-in-part of co-pending application U.S. Serial No. 389,226, filed August 2 , 1989.FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to amperometric biosensing electrodes for the detection of a specific analyte in a test sample. More particularly, this invention relates to novel biosensors containing a polymeric overcoating which confers increased sensitivity to the electrodes when used in biological fluids.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONAmperometric biosensors are capable of quantifying trace amounts of biological analytes such as glucose, urea, cholesterol, and the like in biological fluids. Analyte may be electroxidized directly at the electrode, or an enzyme may be immobilized on an electrode such that the reaction product of the enzyme with its substrate is detected by an electrical change, e.g., change in current flow, at the electrode. The current generated at the electrode is a function of the quantity of analyte in a sample.Historically, electrical communication between enzyme and electrode has been achieved through the use of diffusing mediators. These include small 

diffusing redox shuttles such as ferrocenes, quinones, ruthenium amines, and the like. Enzyme electrodes using such mediators generally require that the enzyme and- mediator shuttle be confined to the proximity of the electrode surface. The small shuttle molecules commonly employed can, however, readily diffuse through membranes that contain the enzyme. These membranes must allow passage of the enzyme's substrate, e.g., glucose and product e.g., gluconate or gluconolactone. Diffusion of the mediators away from the electrode surface results in reduced sensitivity of the electrode.The inventors have previously reported the production of novel amperometric biosensors having a three-dimensional redox polymer network to which a redox enzyme is chemically bound. The three- dimensional redox molecular structure provides electrical contact between the surface of the electrode and the redox enzyme. Such electrodes are described in co-pending application U.S. Serial No. 389,226 which is hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth and in Gregg and Heller, J. Phys. Che . , 95:5970-5980 (1990) and Heller, Accounts of Chem. Res.. 23:128 (1990). The three-dimensional redox network of these electrodes is preferably formed of a redox enzyme, a cross-linking agent, and a cross-linkable compound capable of reacting with the cross-linking agent and the redox enzyme. Either the cross-linkable
