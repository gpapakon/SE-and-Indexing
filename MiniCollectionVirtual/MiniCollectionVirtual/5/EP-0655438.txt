<ABSTRACT>
New chemical compounds, bis(pyrrol-2-yl)halocarbylmethanes, 
also known as meso-halocarbyl 

dipyrromethanes, are made by recting pyrrole in either of 
two reaction schemes. Once such scheme converts pyrrole 

through an intermediate, a halocarbyl carbonyl pyrrole, to a 
[2-(1-hydroxyl-1-hydro-1-halocarbyl)pyrrole]
, and then 
converts the latter to the desired halocarbyldipyrromethane; 

the last step in this scheme is a novel and useful method in 
itself. The other such sequence converts pyrrole, by 

reaction with a halocarbyl aldehyde, directly to the desired 
halocarbyl dipyrromethane. 
5,5'-unsubstituted-meso-halocarbyl dipyrromethanes are useful 
precursors to linear di-, tri-, tetra- and polypyrrolic compounds, as 

well as cyclic polypyrrolic compounds such as porphyrins, azaporphyrins, 
expanded polypyrrolic macrocycles and their metal derivatives.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention provides new synthetic routes to 
5,5'-unsubstituted-meso-halocarbyl dipyrromethanes which are 
useful precursors to linear di-, tri-, tetra-and 
polypyrrolic compounds, as well as cyclic polypyrrolic 
compounds such as porphyrins, azaporphyrins, expanded 
polypyrrolic macrocycles and their metal derivatives. Cyclic polypyrrolic compounds such as porphyrins, 
azaporphyrins and expanded polypyrrolic compounds have found 
many uses both as their non-metallated free-base form as 
well as their metallated forms. Porphyrins in their 
non-metallated form have been used as photosensitizers in 
the novel form of cancer treatment known as photodynamic 
therapy PDT ("Photodynamic Therapy: Basic Principles and 
Clinical Applications"; B. Henderson and T. J. Dougherty, 
Eds., Marcel Dekker, New York, 1992) while in their 
metallated form (particularly as Fe, Co, Mn, and Cr) have 
been used as catalysts for air oxidations of hydrocarbons 
(Ellis and Lyons, Catalysis Lett., 3, 389 1989; Lyons and 
Ellis, Catalysis Lett., 8, 45 1991; U.S. Patents  
 
4,900,871;4,970,348) as well as degradation of lignin in the 
pulp and paper industry (U.S. Patents 4,892,941; 5,077,394). 
Azaporphyrins (U.S. Patent 5,124,449) and expanded 
polypyrrolic macrocycles (B. Ehrenberg, A. Lavi, Y. Nitzan, 
Z. Malik, H. Ladan, F. M. Johnson and J. L. Sessler, 
Proc.SPIE-Int.Soc.Opt.Eng. 1645 259, 1992; B. Franck, G. 
Fuelling, M. Gosmann, G. Knuebel, H. Mertes and D. 
Schroeder, Proc.SPIE-Int.Soc.Opt.Eng. 997 107 1989) have 
also found their use in PDT. In particular, the latter 
group of compounds, due to their ability to coordinate with 
larger paramagnetic metal ions such as Gd and Tc (due to the 
larger central cavity), have been examined as potential 
radiopharmaceuticals and paramagnetic contrast agents in 
magnetic resonance imaging MRI (J.L. Sessler, T.Murai, 
G.Hemmi, Inorg.Chem., 28, 3390 1989). Variation of the type 
and position of the peripheral substituents of these 
macrocycles is known to change their photophysical, 
photochemical and electrochemical properties which in turn 
alter their activity. Catalytic activity of porphyrins is known to increase 
with the introduction of electron-withdrawing substituents 
at all peripheral positions, beta as well as meso. Although 
some useful substituents can be introduced onto the 
macrocycle after its formation e.g. halogens; F, Cl or Br  
 
(U.S. Patents 4,892,941; 4,970,348), nitro NO₂ (U.S. Patent 
5,120,882) and cyano CN (U.S. Patent 5,118,886), certain 
groups e.g.
