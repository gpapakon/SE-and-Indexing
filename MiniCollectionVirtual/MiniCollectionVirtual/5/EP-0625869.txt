<ABSTRACT>
A plasma arc melter which is equipped with at least two 
transferred arc plasma torches of opposite polarities is used to 

melt normal batch materials for producing glass, ceramics, 
refractories and other such materials and for the recycling, 

combustion and/or vitrifying incineration of waste materials. 
To enhance the stability of the plasma jets, the anode torch is 

positioned farther above the surface of the materials being 
processed than the cathode torch and the materials being 

processed are introduced into the melter so that the materials 
first pass beneath the cathode torch. An oxidizing gas can be 

introduced into the zone between the torches in the region of the 
plasma jets to enhance the combustion process. For waste 

materials with a high organic content, a plasma arc afterburner 
can be used to further treat the exhaust gases from the melter.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of heating
materials in a plasma arc melter as defined in the preamble
of claim 1. It furthermore relates to a plasma arc melter
suited for performing such method. The present invention more
specifically relates to an improved plasma arc melter for
melting materials, such as glasses and ceramics, and for the
recycling, combustion and/or vitrifying incineration of waste
materials.U.S. Patent No. 5,028,248, issued July 2, 1991, relates
to a method of and apparatus for melting materials, such as
glass, refractory oxides, silicates and other essentially
non-metalliferous materials, including the various batch
materials for rock wool manufacture, in a plasma arc furnace
which is equipped with at least two transferred-arc plasma
torches.The present invention is an improved method of and
apparatus for melting materials in a plasma arc furnace
equipped with at least two transferred-arc plasma torches
which can be used to melt materials such as those enumerated
above. In addition, the method and apparatus of the present
invention are directed to the disposal of or the recycling,
combustion and/or vitrifying incineration of waste materials.There continues to be a need to efficiently and
effectively melt and process materials such as glasses,
ceramics, oil shale, oily sands, carbonaceous shales and
carbonaceous gold ores and the method and apparatus of the US-5'028'
'248 patent and the improved method and apparatus of the
present invention provide efficient and effective processes
to meet those needs. In addition, the disposal, recycling,
combustion and/or vitrifying incineration 
of industrial, commercial, municipal and other wastes poses an
ever increasing problem in our society.The efficient and effective disposal of potentially
hazardous waste materials such as, contaminated soils, PCB'S,
asbestos wastes, medical wastes, incinerator ash and municipal
wastes can greatly enhance the quality of life in our
industrialized society. Other waste materials including fiber
glass scrap, discarded end-user products, inconsistent-composition
glass cullet, waste liquors, organic-bearing metallic
scrap and organic-bearing metallic/ceramic composites, pose
another problem. With available land fill sites for disposing
of such wastes becoming increasingly scarce and the exorbitant
and rapidly increasing costs associated with the use of land fill
sites, the development of a practical, effective and efficient
method and apparatus for recycling such wastes has become
