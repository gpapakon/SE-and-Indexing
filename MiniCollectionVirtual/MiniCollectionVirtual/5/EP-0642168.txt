<ABSTRACT>
In a nonvolatile semiconductor memory device having 
memory cells of a structure in which a control gate is stacked 

on a floating gate through an insulating film, a phospho-silicate 
glass film is formed on side walls of the floating 

gate and the control gate and a silicon nitride film and an 
arseno-silicate glass film or boro-phospho-silicide glass film 

are sequentially formed so as to cover the control gate. 
A method of manufacturing a nonvolatile semiconductor 
memory device of a structure in which a control gate is 

stacked on a floating gate through an insulating film, 
comprises the steps of: forming the floating gate made of a 

semiconductor layer and the control gate made of a layer 
containing a refractory metal which is stacked on the floating 

gate; covering the floating gate and the control gate by a 
film which prevents a diffusion of metal atoms and transmits 

oxygen; and forming a semiconductor oxide film on side walls  
 

of at least the floating gate by executing a thermal 
oxidation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a nonvolatile
semiconductor memory device.Prior art document JP-A-1 119 070 (pub. 11.05.89),
& Patent Abstracts of Japan, vol. 13, no. 359 (E-804),
August 10, 1990, discloses a nonvolatile semiconductor
memory device having memory cells in which a control gate
is stacked on a floating gate through an insulating film,
comprising a phosphosilicate glass film which is formed on
the side walls of said floating gate and said control gate. Further, document
JP-A-2-79477, which is not part of the prior art, discloses a nonvolatile
semiconductor memory device and a manufacturing method in
which a phospho-silicate glass (PSG) film containing
phosphorus of 1 to 8 weight %, a silicon nitride (Si3N4)
film, and an arseno-silicate glass (AsSG) film or a borophospho-silicate
glass (BPSG) film are sequentially formed
on a floating gate, and by using such a structure, the data
retention characteristics of an EPROM (Erasable and
Programmable Read Only Memory) can be improved.As mentioned above, by using the three layer structure
comprising PSG/Si3N4/AsSG or PSG/Si3N4/BPSG as the
interlayer insulating film, the data retention
characteristics can be improved. However, when the
integration density increases and contact holes become
small, the following problems result. These problems will
be described in detail hereinbelow with reference to
FIGS. 1A and 1B. FIGS. 1A and 1B show a manufacturing method of an
EPROM.As shown in FIG. 1A, a field insulating film 102, a
gate insulating film 103, a floating gate FG", a control
gate CG", insulating films 104 and 105, and a source region
106 and a drain region 107 of, for instance, an N+-type are
formed on a p-type silicon (Si) substrate 101, for example.
Then a PSG film 108, an Si3N4 film 109, and an AsSG film
110 are formed as interlayer insulating films on the whole
surface. As already mentioned above, a BPSG film can be
also used in place of the AsSG film 110.Then, a resist pattern (not shown) in which portions
corresponding to contact holes to be formed is formed on
the AsSG film 110. Then the AsSG film 110, Si3N4 film 109,
PSG film 108, and gate insulating film 103 are sequentially
etched by using the resist pattern as mask. Thus, as shown
in FIG. 1B, contact holes C1' and C2' are formed. Then the
resist pattern is removed.A reflow of the AsSG film 110 is then executed by
performing a thermal treatment. Thus, the shoulder portions 
of the contact holes C1' and C2' are set into a smooth round
shape as shown by alternate long and short dash lines
