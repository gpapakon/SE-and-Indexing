<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a heat-sensitive
recording material. Particularly, it relates to a heat-sensitive
recording material excellent in light
resistance of image areas and the background. More
particularly, it relates to a heat-sensitive recording
material excellent in heat resistance of the background
and in storage stability of image areas.A heat-sensitive recording material usually comprises
a support and a heat-sensitive recording layer containing
an electron donating, normally colorless or light-colored
leuco dye and an electron accepting developer as the main
components, formed on the support, and it is designed so
that when heated with a thermal head, a thermal pen, a
laser beam or the like, the leuco dye and the developer
will react instantaneously to form a record image. Such
a heat-sensitive recording material has merits such that
recording can be carried out by a relatively simple
apparatus, that maintenance is easy and that little noise
is generated, and thus it is useful in a wide range of 
fields including recorders, facsimile machines, printers,
computer terminals, labels and ticket vendors.
Conventional heat-sensitive recording materials wherein a
leuco dye and a developer are employed, had a feature
that the developed color density is high, but at the same
time they had drawbacks such that the background and the
record image areas were likely to undergo yellowing when
exposed to sunlight or room light, or the record image
areas were likely to undergo discoloration. As the
application of heat-sensitive recording materials has
expanded, it has been desired to develop heat-sensitive
recording materials excellent in resistance to such
lights. Further, conventional heat-sensitive recording
materials had a drawback that the storage stability of
record images was poor. For example, when contacted with
a plastic such as polyvinyl chloride, the record images
were likely to fade due to penetration of a plasticizer
or an additive contained in the plastic, or they were
likely to fade when contacted with a chemical reagent
contained in a food or cosmetic. Further, a drawback has
been pointed out such that when letters are written on
the background by a marking means, such letters are
likely to undergo discoloration. Thus, it has been
desired to overcome such drawbacks.In an attempt to improve the resistance of the
background and image areas to lights (hereinafter
referred to as light resistance), it is known to 
incorporate an ultraviolet ray-absorbing agent such as a
benzotriazole
