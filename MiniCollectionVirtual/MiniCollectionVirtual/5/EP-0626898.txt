<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to fluid-operated tools 
for tightening and loosening threaded connectors, including 
an inner threaded part such as for example a stud and an 
outer threaded part such as for example a nut screwed on 
the stud. Fluid-operated tools of the above mentioned general 
type are known in the art. In particular, tools are known 
in which one element pulls the stud so as to elongate it, 
and another element of the tool thereafter turns the nut so 
as to retain the achieved elongation. Therefore, the 
mechanisms for coordination of the application of the 
pulling force to the stud and of the turning force to the 
nut are quite complicated. It has also been found that a 
substantial power of the fluid drive is consumed in order 
to achieve a desired elongation of the stud. It is 
believed to be clear that it would be advisable to design a 
tool which has a lower power consumption. US-A-3877326 discloses a tensioning apparatus in which a number 
of screw bolts or the like are tensioned and then fixing nuts 
are turned by supplying pressure fluid to corresponding 
fluid-operated units acting on the screw bolts and nuts. The 
pressure fluid is first supplied to the fluid-operated units 
which tensions the screw bolts and thereafter is supplied to the 
fluid-operated units to turn the nuts. EP-A-0203003 discloses a device which pulls a bolt and turns a 
nut. Pressure fluid is also initially supplied to a 
fluid-operated unit to pull or tension the bolt and thereafter 
is supplied to a unit for turning the nut.  
 Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention 
to provide a fluid operated tool for tightening and 
loosening threaded connectors, which avoids the disadvantages 
of the prior art. More particularly it is also an object of the present 
invention to provide a fluid operated tool for tightening 
and loosening threaded connectors in which the respective 
coordination of the elongation of the stud and turning of  
 It is also an object of the present invention to 
provide a fluid operated tool for tightening and loosening 
of threaded connectors which provides a desired elongation 
of a stud with a lower power consumption than existing 
tools. In keeping with these objects and with others which 
will become apparent hereinafter, there is provided a fluid-operated tool 
as claimed in the ensuing claim 1. When the tool is designed in accordance with the 
present invention, the coordination between the elongation 
of the stud and the turning of the nut is obtained in a simple
