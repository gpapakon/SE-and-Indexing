<ABSTRACT>
In a deflection yoke four corner magnets (24,25) are used for

each of the corner magnets is disposed in parallel to the Z-axis.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a deflection apparatus in a color picture tube (CRT) 
display system as defined in the preamble of claim 1. Such a deflection 
apparatus is known from EP-A-0 519 505. Due to the flatness of the CRT, a line displayed at the 
top or bottom of the screen of the CRT, that should ideally appear 
as a horizontal straight line, may exhibit a geometry distortion 
commonly referred to as outer pincushion North-South geometry 
distortion. Even a complete correction of outer pincushion 
geometry distortion, for example, by using conventional magnets 
at the top and bottom of the yoke may result in a residual inner 
barrel North-South geometry distortion. Inner barrel North-South 
geometry distortion occurs at a region of the CRT screen, midway 
between the top and center of the CRT screen, or midway between 
the bottom and center of the CRT screen. It may be desirable to 
correct such inner North-South geometry distortion such that 
overall North-South geometry distortion is reduced. Additionally, 
due to the flatness of the CRT, a geometry distortion commonly 
referred to as gullwing distortion may appear in horizontal lines 
displayed on the screen of the CRT. It may also be desirable to 
correct such gullwing distortion. Therefore, four corner magnets, 
embodying an inventive feature, are disposed in the vicinity of 
the electron beam exit portion of the deflection yoke. The corner 
magnets are disposed in a symmetrical manner at four quadrants, 
respectively, of a plane perpendicular to the Z-axis of the CRT. 
The field produced by the corner magnets corrects the 
aforementioned geometry distortions. A deflection apparatus in accordance with the present 
invention includes a cathode ray tube of an in-line system 
including an evacuated glass envelope. A display screen is 
disposed at one end of the envelope. An electron gun assembly is 
disposed at a second end of the envelope. The electron gun 
assembly produces a plurality of electron beams that form 
corresponding rasters on the screen upon deflection. A deflection 
yoke is mounted around the envelope and includes a vertical 
deflection coil for producing a vertical deflection field in the 
cathode ray tube. The deflection yoke further includes a 
horizontal deflection coil for producing a horizontal deflection field  
 
in the cathode ray tube. A core made of magnetically permeable 
material magnetically is coupled to the vertical and horizontal 
deflection coils. A corner magnet having a north-south axis that is 
generally
