<ABSTRACT>
A window glass in a motor vehicle body is slidable in a 
vertical direction within a window frame by means of an 

electric motor (34) controlled by "up" and "down" switches 
(36,40). The window glass slides with reference to a 

window guide channel (11). The window guide channel 
incorporates a metal carrier or other electrical conductor 

(14) which receives the output from electrical oscillating 
means (28). If a human hand, or other part of the human 

body, is present within the frame of the window, when the 
window is open, and within a predetermined distance from 

the window guide channel (11), the resultant capacitive 
effect will change the output of the oscillator (28). 

This output change is detected by a detecting unit (42) 
and opens a switch (38). This switch (38) is connected in 

series with the "up" switch (36) for the window drive 

motor (34) and thus either stops the motor, if it is 
driving the window glass upwards, or prevents the window 

glass from being so driven.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a system for controlling a system for
controlling a power-driven window movable in a window opening
between closed and opened positions, comprising electrical
oscillating means for producing an electrically oscillating
output, electrically conductive means adapted to be positioned
adjacent to the window opening, connecting means connecting the
conductive means to the electrical oscillating means such that
the presence of a part of the human body at or not more than a
predetermined distance from the electrically conductive means
produces a change in the frequency of the electrically
oscillating output, detecting means responsive to the said change
in frequency to produce an output signal, and output means
responsive to the output signal for interrupting movement of the
window glass towards the closed position.Such a system is shown, for example, in US-A-4 453 112. In this
known system, a capacitive pick-up responds to the presence of
part of the human body in the window opening by changing the
frequency of an electrical oscillator. A detecting circuit
measures the rate of change of this frequency. If the rate of
frequency change is above a predetermined value, closing movement
of the window glass is stopped. However, such a system, which
requires accurate measurement of rate of frequency change, may
be adversely affected by component ageing, changes in supply
voltage and the like. The invention aims to mitigate this
problem.Accordingly, the known system is characterised, in accordance
with the invention, in that the detecting means comprises a 
source producing a reference frequency, and comparing means for
comparing the frequency of the electrically oscillating output
with the reference frequency to produce the said output signal.In the invention, therefore, the frequency of the electrically
oscillating output is always compared with a stable reference
frequency.The invention in another aspect also relates to a system for
controlling a power-driven window glass slidable in a window
frame, comprising electrically conductive means adapted to be
mounted in use adjacent to the window opening so as to be
physically moved by direct or indirect contact with part of the
human body positioned between the moving window glass and its
frame during power-driven closure of the window, electrical
circuit means connected to the electrically conductive means so
as to respond to the said movement of the electrically conducted
means and to produce a corresponding output, detecting means
responsive
