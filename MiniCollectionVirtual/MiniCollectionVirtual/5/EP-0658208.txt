<ABSTRACT>
Plants with an altered starch synthesising ability are produced by incorporating into the genome of the plant at least one donor gene encoding a starch primer. The starch primer is an enzyme capable of inititiating starch synthesis, such as amylogenin and/or glycogenin and/or protoglycogenin. DNA constructs encoding a starch primer are provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
 NOVEL PLANTS AND PROCESSES FOR OBTAINING THEMThis invention relates to novel plants having an altered ability to synthesise starch, and to processes for obtaining such novel plants.Starch is an important end-product of carbon fixation during photosynthesis in leaves and is an important storage product in seeds and fruits. Starch comprises up to 75% of the grain dry weight in cereals. In economic terms, the starch produced by the edible portions of three grain crops, wheat, rice and maize, provide approximately two-thirds of the world's food calculated as calories.Starch is synthesised in the plastid compartment (the chloroplast in photosynthetic cells or the amyloplast in non-photosyntiietic cells). The biochemical pathway of starch biosynthesis in leaves has been well-characterised and is shown in Figure 1. The abbreviations used are: G-3-P, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; P., orthophosphate; PP., inorganic pyrophosphate; ADPG/ADPglucose, adenosine diphosphate glucose; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; UDPG/UDPglucose, uridine diphosphate glucose. The reactions are catalysed by the following enzymes: 1) phosphoglycerate kinase/glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 2) triose-phosphate isomerase, 3) aldolase, 4) fructose-l,6-bisphosphatase, 5) hexose phosphate isomerase, 6) phosphoglucomutase, 7) ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, 8) starch synthase, 9) UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, 10) sucrose phosphate synthase, 11) sucrose phosphatase, 12) 

orthophosphate/ triose phosphate translocator, 13) inorganic pyrophosphatase.Knowledge of the pathway in storage tissues was greatly improved following the development of a method for the isolation of intact amyloplasts from wheat endosperm (apRees, 1990) and our recent research with 13C labelling studies in wheat and maize (Keeling e_t l^, 1988, Plant Physiology, 87:311-319; Keeling, 1990, ed. CD. Boyer, J.C.Shannon and R.C. Harrison, pp.63-78, being a presentation at the 4th Annual Penn State Symposium in Plant Physiology, May 1989). Figure 2 shows the metabolic pathway of starch biosynthesis in maize endosperm. The abbreviations used are the same as in Figure 1. The reactions are catalysed by the following enzymes: 1) sucrose synthase, 2)UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, 3) hexokinase, 4) phosphoglucomutase, 5) hexose-phosphate isomerase,6) ATP-dependent phosphofructokinase, 7)PP.-dependent phosphofructokinase, 8) aldolase, 9) triose-phosphate isomerase, 10) hexose-phosphate translocator, 11) ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase,12) starch
