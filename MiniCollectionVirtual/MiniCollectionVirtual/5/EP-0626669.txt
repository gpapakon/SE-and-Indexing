<ABSTRACT>
Deflection apparatus for a raster scanned cathode ray tube display
comprises a flyback circuit (T2,T4,Ly,Df,Cf) including a switch (T2,T4)

connected in series with an inductor (Ly). The switch (T4) is responsive
to a line drive signal (LINE) to alternately open and close a current

path through the inductor (Ly) between a first voltage level (B+) and a
second voltage level (OV) lower than the first voltage level (B+) to

generate a raster scan current signal in a deflection coil of the
display. The amplitude of the raster scan signal is determined as a

function of the first voltage level (B+) and the frequency of the line
drive signal (LINE). A feedback circuit (D2,R3,D3,C2) connected to the

switch (T4) generates a feedback signal (F) as a function of current
flowing out of the switch (T4). A regulator (600-630,T3,L,D1,C1) is

connected to the flyback circuit (T2,T4,Ly,Df,Cf) for varying the first
voltage level (B+) as a function of the feedback signal (F) to maintain a

constant raster scan width despite variations in the frequency of the
line drive signal (LINE).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to deflection apparatus for a raster 
scanned CRT display. Many raster scanned CRT displays are now designed to be compatible 
with a wide range of computer systems each capable of generating one or 
more different raster display formats. Each raster display format is 
generally characterised by a different pair of line and frame scanning 
frequencies. A conventional line scan circuit for driving the horizontal 
deflection coils for a CRT display comprises a ramp generator for 
producing a line scan current signal in the deflection coils in 
synchronisation with a raster line synchronisation (sync) signal 
generated by the host computer. The line scan signal is generally in the 
form of a sawtooth waveform. However, to bring the angular velocity into 
line with the arc of the CRT screen to ensure that the or each electron 
beam tracks each line of the raster with constant velocity, a degree of 
"S correction" is applied to the line scan signal. The degree of "S 
correction is determined by an S correction capacitance conventionally 
connected in series with the deflection coils. The amplitude of the line scan signal is inversely proportional to 
the frequency of the line sync signal. Therefore, the width of the 
picture displayed on the CRT screen is inversely proportional to the 
frequency of the line sync signal. Typically, in CRT displays that are capable of displaying different 
raster display formats, a ramp regulator is connected to the ramp 
generator to reduce the effect of changes in line sync frequency on 
displayed picture width by varying the amplitude of the line scan signal 
as a function of a reference input and a feedback signal. The feedback 
signal is generated as a function of tile line scan signal by a feedback 
circuit connected to the ramp generator and the regulator. The feedback 
circuit typically includes a sense component inserted into the path of 
the line scan signal to generate the feedback signal as a function of the 
line scan signal. However, the presence of the sense component in the 
path of the line scan signal degrades the line scan signal by introducing 
energy losses and potential ringing to the ramp generator.  In some conventional CRT displays, the ramp regulator is configured 
to operate only within discrete bands of line sync frequencies each 
centred on a different commonly-used line sync frequency. Each band is 
separated from adjacent bands by a dead band. The dead bands prevent the 
ramp regulator from spuriously toggling
