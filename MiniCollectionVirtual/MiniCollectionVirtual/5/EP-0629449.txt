<ABSTRACT>
Compact electrofilter comprising a plurality of parallel precipitation electrodes 4 which are constructed as perpendicularly aligned plates and have cutouts 41, preferably holes, in the region of at least their lower, preferably all their corners, and comprising furthermore a plurality of bar (pencil) electrodes 5, extending parallel to an edge of the precipitation electrodes 4 and arranged in a suspended frame parallel to the precipitation electrodes 4, as emission electrodes to which a negative high voltage is applied, which electrodes 4, 5 are arranged in a housing 1 provided with at least in each case one inlet and outlet duct 2, 3 tapering away from the electrodes. In order for its dimensions and operating parameters to be adaptable to the conditions of small to medium boiler systems and yet to produce a precipitation performance which is optimum in relation to its dimensions, it is provided that at least one frame part 51 of the suspension of the emission electrodes 5 is guided through the cutouts 41 in the precipitation electrodes 4, and the precipitation electrodes 4 are guided up to the start of each tapering section of the inlet duct 2 and outlet duct 3.
