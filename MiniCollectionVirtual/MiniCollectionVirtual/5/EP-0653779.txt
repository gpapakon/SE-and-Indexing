<CLAIMS>
Arrangement for thermal treatment of semiconductor substrate slices with an areal
heater of electrically conductive resistance material, wherein the heater is arranged

parallel to the substrate plane and spaced therefrom and has in the surface a structure in
the form of interruptions, wherein an areal shielding, which has substantially the same

material composition as the heater, is present on the side of the heater remote from the
substrate plane.
Arrangement according to claim 1, characterised thereby that the shielding is
formed by side walls and a pot element closing the side, which is remote from the

substrate, of the heater.
Arrangement according to claim 1 or 2, characterised thereby that at least one
sensor element is disposed between heater and shielding and that this sensor element is

encapsulated by material of substantially the same composition as the material of the
heater.
Arrangement according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised thereby that the
heater consists of electrographite.
Arrangement according to claim 4, characterised thereby that the heater is
pyrolytically coated.
