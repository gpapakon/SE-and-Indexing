<ABSTRACT>
The ammunition comprises, on the one hand, a plurality of consumable modules, each produced in the form of a flattened strip (100) of juxtaposed cartridges, each comprising a payload of chaff, a pyrotechnic ejection charge and electrical initiator means and, on the other hand, a reusable support (200) receiving the strips and equipped with means (300) for immobilizing these strips and with a transport and stand-by handle (230). According to the invention, the strips are laid with their flattened face against one another, so as to form a uniform block constituting essentially the body of the ammunition or part of the body of the latter, and the support (200) comprises a fixed plate (210) carrying the strips and, when these are inserted, receiving them slidably in a general direction parallel to the plane of the plate.

A munition forming a cartridge-launcher loader, 
in particular for countermeasure cartridge-loaders for 

aircraft, this munition comprising, on the one hand, a 
plurality of consumable modules each in the form of a 

flat strip (100) of juxtaposed cartridges each comprising 
a payload of chaff (155), an ejector pyrotechnic charge 

(153) and electrical initiator means (151) and, on the 
other hand, a reusable support (200) receiving the strips 

having means (300) for immobilising the strips and a 
handle (230) for transporting and installing it,
 
   characterised in that the strips are juxtaposed at 

their flat surface to form a homogeneous block 
essentially constituting the body of the munition or a 

part of the body thereof and in that the support (200) 
includes a fixed plate (210) carrying the strips and 

receiving the latter, when they are inserted, by virtue 
of them sliding in a general direction parallel to the 

plane of the plate. 
The munition according to claim 1 wherein the 
plate and the strips comprise cooperating means 

(120, 211), for example of the dovetail slot type, for 
simultaneously guiding sliding of the strips as they are 

inserted and mechanically coupling the strips to the 
plate. 
The munition according to claim 1 or claim 2 
wherein the support (200) further includes a wall (220) 

perpendicular to the plane of the plate against which the 
strips abut at the end of insertion. 
The munition according to claim 3 wherein the 
wall is substantially centrally located relative to the 

surface of the plate and the plate carries two groups of 
strips symmetrically disposed on respective sides of the 

wall, the strips of each group abutting against a 
respective one of the two opposite sides of the wall.  

 
The munition according to claim 3 or claim 4 
wherein the strips each include on their flat side a 

locking through-hole (110), the respective holes of the 
block of strips being all aligned, and the munition 

further comprises a locking pin (310) inserted into the 
series of aligned holes of the block to fasten the strips 

together. 
The munition according to claim 4 in combination 
with claim 5 wherein the pin (310) is a double pin with 

two branches (311) straddling the wall and each inserted 
into the respective series of aligned holes (110) in two 

groups of strips symmetrically disposed on opposite sides 
of the wall. 
The munition according to any one of claims 3 to 
6 wherein the side of the strip abutted against the wall 

carries a centering and locking pin (130) which is 
inserted at the end of inse
rtion into a cooperating hole 
(222) in the wall; alternatively, a hole is provided in 

the side of the strip abutting against the wall, into 
which hole a centering and locking pin carried by the 

wall is inserted at the end of insertion. 
The munition according to any one of claims 3 to 
7 wherein the transport and installation handle (230) is 

a retractable handle carried by the wall (220) and this 
handle is provided with lateral projections (232) which, 

after insertion of the munition into the cartridge-launcher 
and retraction of the handle, locates in the gap 

between the munition and the cartridge-launcher (400), so 
eliminating any clearance between these two members, and 

holds the munition in place in the cartridge-launcher 
after folding down a locking stirrup of the cartridge-launcher, 

these projections further preventing folding 
down of the stirrup when the handle is deployed. 
The munition according to any one of claims 2 to 
8 wherein the means for guiding sliding of the strips and  

 
mechanically coupling the strips to the plate comprise a 

printed circuit (213) fastened to the plate and carrying 
electrical tracks cooperating elastically with a 

homologous contact (140) connected to electrical 
initiator means (151) of each cartridge in the strip. 
The munition according to any one of claims 1 
to 9 wherein the cartridges in each strip and the payload 

of chaff they contain are essentially square or 
rectangular in cross-section with the width equal to the 

transverse dimension of the strip, less the wall 
thickness.
