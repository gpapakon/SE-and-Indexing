<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a design cover disc for disc wheels which completely covers the spoke regions and recesses in the disc wheel. For simple and secure fitting it is provided according to the invention that the cover disc (7), which has the shape of a circular disc, has around its circumference projections (10) which protrude at uniform spacings, are overlapped by approximately semicircular clamping plates (15) and are fastened in corresponding threaded holes (12) in the disc wheel (1) by means of screws.

A design-cover for disk wheels which totally covers the 
spoke regions and cavities of the disk wheel, 
characterized 
in that said circular disk-shaped cover (7) comprises 

raised faces (10) protruding equally spaced from its 
circumference which are covered by approximately semi-circular 

clamping plates (15) and are tensioned in 
corresponding tappings (12) of said disk wheel (1) by means 

of screws. 
The cover as set forth in claim 1, characterized in that 
said protruding raised faces (10) comprise semi-circular 

recesses (11) having a diameter corresponding to at least 
that of said tappings (12). 
The cover as set forth in claim 1 and 2, characterized in 
that said clamping plates (15) comprise, in aligninment 

with each tapping (12), a central drilled hole (16) the 
surrounding region (17) of which is recessed slantingly 

inwards and engages said semi-circular recesses (11) of 
said raised faces (10) of the cover (7). 
The cover as set forth in claim 1, characterized in that 
said cover (7) is configured dished and in that said raised 

faces (10) are stepped downwards at the region adjoining 
the circumference of the cover parallel to said cover (7). 
The cover as set forth in claim 1, characterized in that 
said clamping plates (15) comprise on their semi-circular 

circumference a rim (18) flanged at 90° which following 
tightening of said screws is supported by the outer surface 

(20) of said disk-wheel (1). 
The cover as set forth in claim 1, characterized in that  
 

said rim (13) of said cover (7) is flanged 90° to the rear 
in the circumferential region between said protruding 

raised faces (10). 
The cover as set forth in claim 2 and 4, characterized in 
that between said swept-down raised faces (10) and said 

disk wheel (1) a rubber buffer (21) is inserted. 
The cover as set forth in one or more of the claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that said cover (7) comprises a profiled 

embossment (23, 24) of a surface pattern. 
The cover as set forth in one or more of the claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the surface of said cover (7) is 

provided with a graphical, colored design.
