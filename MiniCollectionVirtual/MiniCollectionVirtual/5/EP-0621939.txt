<ABSTRACT>
An air-conditioning unit with a recuperative heat exchanger (24), preferably a plate heat exchanger, in which exhaust-air passages (23) are disposed in cross-flow relation to supply-air passages (20) over a portion of the length of the passages, namely at the inlets and outlets of the passages, and in counterflow relation over the remaining portion of the length of the passages. Control of the supply-air temperature is effected by controlled bypassing of the supply air and/or the exhaust air over the heat exchanger (34) by means of dampers (26, 27).

<DESCRIPTION>
 Air conditioning apparatusThis invention relates to an air-conditioning unit of the kind which comprises a recuperative heat exchanger having a system of parallel supply-air passages and a system of exhaust-air passages which are disposed in heat-exchanging re¬ lation to the supply-air passages. More particularly, the in¬ vention relates to an air-conditioning unit of the kind de¬ fined in the precharacterising part of claim 1. Moreover, the invention relates to a method for controlling the supply air temperature in air-conditioning units of this kind.Air-conditioning units of the kind the invention is con¬ cerned with are common in ventilating or air-conditioning systems for general or comfort ventilation of dwellings, com¬ mercial premises in a broad sense, such as offices, schools, hospitals, assembly halls etc., and industry and crafts pre¬ mises.Among the several requirements to be met by air-condi¬ tioning units of this kind are low operating costs and high temperature efficiency of the unit and possibility to con- trol the temperature of the supply air by simple means.The air-conditioning unit according to the invention combines in a favourable way these requirements with other important requirements. This is achieved through the con¬ struction set forth in claim 1. The invention is described in greater detail below with reference to the accompanying drawing, which is a diagrammat¬ ic vertical longitudinal sectional view of an air-condition¬ ing unit embodying the invention.As illustrated, the air-conditioning unit comprises a substantially parallelepipedal, heat-insulating enclosure 11 having an intake 12 for outside air to be converted to supply air, an outlet 13 for supply air, an intake 14 for exhaust air and an outlet 15 for the exhaust air (extract air) . Between the outside-air intake 12, which includes a damper 16 and a supply-air filter 17, both of a conventional kind, and the exhaust-air outlet a supply-air duct extends which is formed by a horizontal lower duct section 18, an overlying, likewise horizontal upper duct section 19 and a 

 system of supply-air passages 20 connecting these duct sec¬ tions.Similarly, between the exhaust-air intake 14 and the exhaust-air outlet 15 extends an exhaust-air duct formed by a horizontal upper duct section 21, an underlying, likewise hor¬ izontal lower duct section 22 and a system of exhaust-air passages 23 interconnecting these duct sections.The supply-air passages 20 and the exhaust-air passages 23 form part of a recuperative heat exchanger 24
