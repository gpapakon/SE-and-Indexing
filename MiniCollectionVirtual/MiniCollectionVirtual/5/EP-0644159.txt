<ABSTRACT>
Untreated water introduced into a water spinning 
treatment apparatus is spun therein counterclockwise in the 

northern hemisphere or clockwise in the southern hemisphere 
as viewed in the direction of gravity, thereby separating 

undesirable substances contained in the untreated water. 
Using this method, impurities are removed from turbid water 

to obtain purified water, or sea water is desalinized for 
conversion to fresh water.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a water treatment 
method for separating undesirable substances from water 
containing such substances, and an apparatus for implementing 
the same method. Methods commonly used to remove impurities contained in 
turbid water to obtain clean, purified water include the 
batch process wherein the turbid water to be treated is fed 
into a plurality of large tanks in time series with impurities 
being caused to settle out as sludge by centrifugal 
force. To allow the impurity separation to proceed faster, 
the activated sludge process is also widely employed that 
involves the sedimentation or filtration of impurities in 
tanks with chlorine or other chemicals applied during the 
process. These known methods, however, require a large area for 
water treatment as well as expensive tanks and a large power 
for moving the untreated water. These methods also involve 
a problem in that the treatment work needs special care 
because of the use of chloride that can cause trichloromethane  
 
and that can be hazardous to humans. One object of the present invention is to provide a 
method of water treatment capable of separating impurities 
contained in turbid water and obtaining purified water in a 
very simple and easy manner by using the principle of a 
liquid cyclone, and an apparatus for water treatment implementing 
the same method. Another object of the present invention is to provide a 
method of water treatment capable of obtaining fresh water 
from sea water in a simple manner, and an apparatus for 
water treatment implementing the same method. According to the present invention, untreated water 
containing undesirable substances is introduced, with its 
velocity increased under pressure, and is spun to the left 
(in a counterclockwise direction) in the northern hemisphere 
or the right (in a clockwise direction) in the southern 
hemisphere as viewed in the direction of gravity. With this 
spinning motion, the untreated water rises upward in a 
helical path while being spun counterclockwise or clockwise, 
and at the lowermost point of the helical stream, the 
substances having densities different than the density of 
water (i.e. having densities greater than the density of 
water) are precipitated and separated from the water. The  
 
purified water, with undesirable substances removed from it, 
rises upward and is discharged to the outside. When the 
same treatment was carried out, except that the water was 
spun to the right (in a clockwise direction) in the northern 
hem
