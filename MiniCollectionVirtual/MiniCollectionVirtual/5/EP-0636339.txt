<ABSTRACT>
A vacuum cleaner includes a ventilating 
quantity controlling valve (28) in a ventilating path to a 

runner (24) which rotates respondingly to a sucking force, a 
rotating angle of the ventilating quantity controlling 

valve is varied its rotation angle following an increase 
of the sucking force so that an increase of a sucking 

quantity is suppressed and an increase of a voltage 
generated by an electric generator (26) is suppressed, the 

electric generator being rotated by the runner.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vacuum
cleaner according to the preamble of claim 1.A vacuum cleaner according to the preamble of claim 1 is known
from GB-A-2 082 351.A vacuum cleaner, which is well known from the
past years, comprises a main body case 1, a suction hose
section 2 and a suction nozzle section 3, as is
illustrated in Fig. 5. The main body case 1 has a motor
4, a fan 5, a filter 6, a dust bag 7, a motor
controlling circuitry 8 and the like within. The
suction hose section 2 comprises a hose 9 and an
extention pipe 10. An operating section 11 is provided
in a central portion of the suction hose section 2. As
one species of vacuum cleaner among vacuum cleaners of
such kind, there exists a vacuum cleaner having an
electric generator which generates a voltage 
corresponding to a suction quantity for sucking dust,
which vacuum cleaner is developed by the inventor and
others. The electric generator is housed within the
operating section 11, as is illustrated in Fig. 6, for
example. In Fig. 6, when the outside air is sucked
through a suction opening 13 by a sucking pressure, a
turbine runner 14 is rotated by the sucked air so that
the electric generator 12 rotates and generates a
voltage. The voltage is supplied as power voltage to a
dust sensor circuitry section 17 which includes a light
emitting device 15, a light receiving device 16, and the
like.But sucking vacuum pressure of household vacuum
cleaners varies widely such as about from -40 to 3000
mmAq (-0.004 to 0.29 bar). Therefore, rotating
speed of the turbine runner 14
varies greatly such as about from 4000 to 70000 r.p.m.
(revolutions per minute). Though the electric generator 12
is directly coupled to the turbine runner 14, the
electric generator 12 rotates in correspondence to the
great variation of the rotating speed so that the
generated voltage varies within an extent from several
volts to several tens volts. Therefore, the generated
voltage is required stabilization because the generated
voltage is used as the power voltage of various
controlling circuitries such as the dust sensor 
circuitry section 7 and the like. Though various
electric circuitries are employed for stabilizing the
voltage, a disadvantage arises in that each eleciric
circuitry requires many electronic parts causing waste
such as generation of heat and the like. Further, a
disadvantage arises in that excessively high rotation is
improper for the turbine and the electric generator in
view of durability of bearing arrangement.Document DE-A-23 36 758

rotating force of said runner (24) so as to generate a vo
ltage,

characterized by

a body (23) having a sucking opening (21) and an opening (22)
connected to said suction hose section (2, 9, 10), the body (23)

housing said runner (24), and
a passing through quantity controlling valve (28) which is
provided between said runner (24) and said opening (22) in a

passing path for said runner and adjusts a passing through
quantity responding to an outside air sucking pressure.
A vacuum cleaner as set forth in claim 1, characterized in
that said passing through quantity controlling valve (28) is a

ventilating quantity controlling valve, and said ventilating
quantity controlling valve (28) is provided in a ventilating

path of said runner (24).
