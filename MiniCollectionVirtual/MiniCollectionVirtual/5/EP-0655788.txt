<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor device (10) is described, incorporating 
electron traps E

 at the interface (15) between a semiconductor 
substrate (13) and a gate dielectric layer (12) of an insulated gate 

field effect transistor, such device being capable of retaining charge 
in the electron traps for a certain time, allowing volatile memory 

circuits to be produced wherein each cell occupies only the area 
required for a single transistor.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a semiconductor device and more particularly to a
volatile semiconductor memory device, constructed with a metal-insulator-semiconductor
structure.There are known two basic types of semiconductor memory, that known as
volatile memory and that known as non-volatile memory. In volatile memories the
stored data is lost when the power supply is removed from the semiconductor
device. Non-volatile memory retains the data stored for extended periods after the
power supply to the device has been removed.In a computer architecture, non-volatile memory is used for long-term
storage of programs and data which seldom or never change, and volatile memory
devices are used for the short-term storage of programme instructions and data
during the execution of a program.Known volatile memory devices may be further divided into two categories.
Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) consists of flip-flop latches, which each
retain one bit of data for as long as power is maintained. In Dynamic Random
Access Memory (DRAM), each memory cell is made up from one transistor and
a capacitor.Figure 1 shows, schematically, the construction of a typical DRAM cell
where C represents the capacitor for storing charge, and T represents the transistor
which serves to transport charge to the capacitor, and also, operated under different
bias conditions, for reading the charged or uncharged state of the capacitor. The
data bit is stored as charge on the capacitor and decays with time, due to the 
leakage current of the capacitor. Each bit of data in a DRAM device must
therefore be periodically refreshed before it has decayed irretrievably.Known DRAM cells are also susceptible to failure due to incident ionising
radiation. Such radiation may originate in the atmosphere in the form of cosmic
rays, in the working environment of the memory device, or even in the packaging
materials used to encase the memory device. When a particle or ray of incident
radiation meets the memory device, it may cause a temporary conductive path to
be established, by forming electron/hole pairs in the dielectric or substrate layers.
This conductive path may breach either the dielectric layer of the charge storage
capacitor or a P-N junction below the charge storage capacitor, in either case,
causing loss of charge and hence loss of stored data.In known non-volatile memory devices, a charge is stored directly above the
channel regions of insulated gate field effect transistors (IGFETs) resulting in the
modulation of the IGFET's conductance.
