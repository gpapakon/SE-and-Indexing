<ABSTRACT>
All calls for specific users are signalled to an inter-regional switching centre from which they are forwarded according to predefined criteria (time of day, regional origin) to different terminals. The type and origin of a connection request are indicated to the called user (B). The user selects, on an individual case basis, a specific terminal (B, B', B'') to which the call is forwarded, or he rejects the call. One possible solution is offered by a pager-type terminal with an acknowledgement facility; this can be combined with a voice terminal.
