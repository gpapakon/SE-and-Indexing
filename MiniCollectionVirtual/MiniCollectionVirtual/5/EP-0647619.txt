<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a process for the isomerisation of 2-methyl-3-butenenitrile to linear pentenenitrile, in particular to 3-pentenenitrile. More precisely, it consists of a process for the isomeration of 2-methyl-3-butenenitrile to a linear pentenenitrile, characterised in that the reaction is carried out in the presence of an aqueous solution of at least one sulphonated phosphine (1) and of at least one transition metal compound. 3-Pentenenitrile is an intermediate compound in the preparation of adiponitrile.
