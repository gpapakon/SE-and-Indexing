<ABSTRACT>
A mosquito net (13) with automatic net tensioning 
device comprising: a housing (11) containing a screen 

winding shaft with which an elastic element is 
associated in order to cause the rotation thereof to 

be stopped by friction; two vertical guides (24) provided 
with brush-like (25,26) elements, which vertical guides 

perform the task of allowing opposite longitudinal 
ends of the screen to slide; a handle bar (14) constrained 

to a free transversal end of the screen; a bottom 
transversal section bar (27) to connect both said vertical 

guides; and a drive element to drive said winding 
shaft rotation, in which the handle bar and the bottom 

section bar are provided with complementary automatic 
hooking elements (29,30) which interact with each other when 

an external stress is applied to the screen. 
Also an adjustable-in-position stop element for 
said rotation drive element, consisting of a chain, is 

provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a mosquito net 
with an automatic screen tensioning device. In the mosquito nets known from the prior art, 
particularly complex devices are provided in order to 
cause the screen to remain locked in its unwound, 
lowered position in order to close the window space, 
or the like. Besides having a rather complicated structure, 
which implies considerable manufacturing costs and 
high selling prices, also problems of correct assembly 
and positioning exist. In fact, e.g., in some of these mosquito nets, 
the installer is obliged to perform an adjustment of 
mechanisms associated with the net winding shaft, with 
complex operations having to be carried out during the 
assembly step. DE-A-4 104 749 describes a mosquito net 
according to the preamble of claim 1. The purpose of the present invention is hence of 
providing a mosquito net which is provided with an 
automatically acting screen tensioning device capable 
of solving the assembly and construction complexity 
problems which affect the mosquito nets used 
heretofore. This purpose according to the present invention 
is achieved by providing a mosquito net (according to claim 1.)  
 The characteristics and advantages of a mosquito 
net according to the present invention will be better 
evident from the following exemplifying, non-limitative 
disclosure, referred to the accompanying 
schematic drawings in which: 
Figure 1 shows a partially sectional side 
elevation view of a mosquito net provided with the 
automatic screen tensioning device according to the 
present invention, in which in a portion thereof the 
position of the screen nearby the side guide 
with the screen being during its downwards moving 
step; and in another portion the position of said 
screen in its central portion when the screen 
undergoes the wind action are displayed; Figure 2 is an elevation view showing a detail 
similar to Figure 1, with the screen being commanded 
to move upwards; Figure 3 shows the sectional view of an enlarged 
detail of the screen winding/unwinding drive element; 
and  
 Figure 4 shows a sectional view taken along the 
line IV-IV of Figure 3. Referring to the figures, a mosquito net is shown 
which is equipped with an automatic screen tensioning 
device according to the present invention. Inside a partially shown housing 11, on a winding 
shaft 12 a screen 13 winds which at its free bottom 
transversal end bears a handle bar 14 constrained to 
it. Through an inner seat 15, the shaft 12 is 
constrained to a sleeve 16 having

<CLAIMS>
Mosquito net with automatic net tensioning 
device comprising: a housing (11) containing a screen 

winding shaft (12) with which an elastic element (20) is 
associated in order to cause the rotation thereof to 

be stopped by friction; two vertical guides (24) provided 
with brush-like elements (25,26), which vertical guides (24) 

perform the task of allowing opposite longitudinal 
ends of the screen to slide; a handle bar (14) constrained 

to a free transversal end of the screen (13); a bottom 
transversal section bar (27) to connect both said vertical 

guides (24); whereby in that said handle bar (14) and 
said bottom section bar (27) are provided with 

complementary automatic hooking elements (29,30) which 
interact with each other when an external stress is 

applied to said screen (13)
 
characterized 

by further comprising a drive element (22,23) to drive the rotation of 
said shaft, wherein said hooking elements comprise 

a transversal hooking tooth (29) provided on said bottom 
section bar (27) and a sharp-pointed portion (30) provided in 

the upper region of said handle bar (14), with said section 
bar (27) displaying a contoured hollow suitable for 

receiving said handle bar (14) and to cause said sharp-pointed 
portion (30) to get positioned, by gravity, under 

said hooking tooth (29). 
Mosquito net according to claim 1, 
characterized in that each of both said vertical 

guides (24) contain a pair of brushes with bristles (25,26) with 
different bristle heights.  

 
Mosquito net according to claim 1, 
characterized in that said drive element which drives 

the rotation of said winding shaft (12) comprises a ring 
gear (21) with which balls (22) of a ball chain (23) get engaged, 

with said ring gear (21) bearing disengagement elements 
which cause said elastic element (20) to get disengaged 

from said winding shaft. 
Mosquito net according to claim 3, 
characterized in that a stop element (33) is provided, 

which is suitable for being installed in spring-like 
fashion, on said chain (23), in order to limit the stroke 

thereof. 
Mosquito net according to claim 3, 
characterized in that said chain (23) is constituted by one 

single, closed-ring piece.
