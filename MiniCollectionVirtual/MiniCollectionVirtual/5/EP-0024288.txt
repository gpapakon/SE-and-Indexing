<ABSTRACT>
A computer system is described having two processors 
(100, 200) and a segmented storage (300, 400) so as to 

permit simultaneous access of respective segments of stor­
age by the two processors. The address path of one pro­

cessor (200) is limited to a particular segment (400) of 
storage so as to eliminate contention in the other segment 

(300). The other processor (100) can however address 
both segments (300 and 400) of storage. Storage conten­

tion in respect of the shared storage segment (400) is 
resolved on the basis of addressing. If both processors 

are simultaneously trying to address the same segment 
(400) of storage, the processor (100) which can address 

both segments of storage is granted the access.
