<ABSTRACT>
To fasten spinning rotors (1) to their rotor shaft (2), it is proposed that the rotor shaft have a stop (4), on which the collar (3) for receiving the spinning rotor (1) is supported. The stop (4) can be formed in one piece with the rotor shaft (2) and be designed as a micro-stop, on which the collar (3) is supported axially.
