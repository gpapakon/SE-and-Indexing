<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of searching for a signalling channel in a radio system comprising a mobile exchange (100), base stations (BS1, 101) connected therewhith, subscriber stations (MS1, 103) that are connected with the base stations and communicate with the radio system via the channels of the base station (BS1, 101), i.e. via traffic channels and non-dedicated control channels; the method comprising the following steps: a first subscriber station (MS1, 103) registered in a first base station (BS1, 101) listens to a signalling channel of the first base station (BS1, 101), and the radio system allocates said signalling channel to a second subscriber station for use as a traffic channel since the other channels of the first base station (BS1, 101) are busy. To improve the efficiency of the radio system, when the first subscriber station (MS1, 103) detects that the signalling channel used by it is assigned as a traffic channel for communication between the second subscriber station and the first base station (BS1, 101), the first subscriber station (MS1, 103) stays to listen for a predetermined time to each channel of the first base station (BS1) in succession, tuning its radio unit to a channel and monitoring whether the base station (BS1) is transmitting on the channel radio traffic typical of a signalling channel.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of searching
for a signalling channel in a radio system comprising
a mobile exchange, base stations connected therewith,
subscriber stations that are connected with the base
stations and communicate with the radio system via the
channels of the base station, i.e. via traffic channels
and non-dedicated control channels; the method comprising
the following steps: a first subscriber station
registered in a first base station listens to a signalling
channel of the first base station, and the radio
system allocates said signalling channel to a second
subscriber station for use as a traffic channel since
the other channels of the first base station are busy.The invention concerns cellular radio systems,
such as mobile phone systems and PMR systems (PMR =
private mobile radio), i.e. cellular radio networks in
which the area covered by the network is divided into
radio cells. The subscribers roaming in the area of
these radio cells communicate with the system when they
are within the coverage area of the base stations
located in the radio cells.In a system like this, a subscriber station,
such as a mobile phones, located in a radio cell listens
or tunes the receiver unit of its radio to the frequency
of a signalling channel of a base station located in the
radio cell. A signalling channel is used for exchanging
messages concerning the connection establishment between
a subscriber station and a base station. On the basis
of connection establishment, the system controller of 
the cellular radio network assigns the subscriber stations
to actual traffic channels, in which the actual
transfer of information, i.e. speech or data, takes
place. Traffic between a base station and subscriber
stations takes place on radio channels that are
implemented such that downlink traffic (from a base
station to a subscriber station) takes place at a first
frequency, and uplink traffic (from a subscriber station
to a base station), at a second frequency. In FDMA
systems (FDMA = Frequency Division Multiplexing Access)
a channel thus means a pair of channels used for one
conversation. In a TDMA system (TDMA = Time Division
Multiplexing Access) a channel means a carrier and its
time slot.It is typical of channels provided between base
stations and subscriber stations that there is a limited
number of channels available since there are few radio
frequencies and/or time slots. It is thus typical of
cellular radio systems that one - possibly the only -
signalling channel of a base station can be

A method of searching for a signalling
channel in a radio system comprising a mobile exchange

(Fig. 1, 100; 300, 400, 500), base stations (BS1, BS2)
connected therewith, subscriber stations (MS1, MS2, 600)

that are connected with the base stations and communicate
with the radio system via the channels of the base

station (BS1, 101), i.e. via traffic channels and non-dedicated
control channels; the method comprising the

following steps:

a first subscriber station (MS1, 600) registered
in a first base station (BS1) listens to a signalling

channel of the first base station (BS1), and
the radio system allocates (303) said signalling
channel to a second subscriber station (MS2, 600)

for use as a traffic channel since the other channels
of the first base station (BS1) are busy;
the method being 
characterised
 in
that
the first subscriber station (MS1, 600) detects
that the signalling channel used by it is assigned as

a traffic channel for communication between the second
subscriber station (MS2, 600) and the first base station

(BS1, 101), and
the first subscriber station (MS1, 600) stays
to listen for a predetermined time to each channel of

the first base station (BS1) in succession, tuning its
radio unit (601) to a channel and monitoring whether the

first base station (BS1) is transmitting on the channel radio
traffic typical of a signalling channel.
The method according to claim 1, 
characterised
 in that when said channel assigned
for communication between the second subscriber station

(MS2, 600) and the first base station (BS1, 101) is 
released before said predetermined time has ended so

that it may again function as a signalling channel, the
radio system allocates said channel for use as a traffic

channel between the first subscriber station (MS1, 600)
and said first base station (BS1).
The method according to claim 1, 
characterised

in that when said predetermined time
ends without that said channel assigned for communication

between the second subscriber station (MS2, 600)
and the first base station (BS1) is released, said first

subscriber station (MS1, 600) starts to listen to the
channels of the second base station (BS2) to find a new

signalling channel, tuning its radio unit (601) to a
channel and monitoring whether the second base station

(BS2) transmits on the channel radio traffic typical of
a signalling channel.
A method of searching for a signalling
channel in a radio system comprising a mobile exchange

(100, 300, 400, 500), base stations (BS1, BS2) connected
therewith, subscriber stations (MS1, MS2, 600) that are

connected with the base stations and communicate with
the radio system via the channels of the base station

(BS1, 101), i.e. via traffic channels and non-dedicated
control channels; the method comprising the following

steps:

a first subscriber station (MS1, 600) registered
in a first base station (BS1) listens to a signalling

channel of the first base station (BS1), and
the radio system allocates (303) said signalling
channel to a second subscriber station (MS2, 600)

for use as a traffic channel since the other channels
of the first base station (BS1) are busy;
the method being 
characterised
 in
that 
the first subscriber station (MS1, 600) detects
that the signalling channel used by it is assigned as

a traffic channel for communication between the second
subscriber station (MS2, 600) and the first base station

(BS1, 101),
the first subscriber station (MS1, 600) stays
to listen for a predetermined time to the inband signalling

on said signalling channel that has been converted
to a traffic channel.
The method according to claim 4, 
characterised

in that if within said predetermined
time the inband signalling on said signalling channel

converted to a traffic channel comprises information
indicating that the channel allocated for use as a

traffic channel between the base station and subscriber
stations is converted to a signalling channel, the first

subscriber station (MS1, 600) moves to listen to said
converted signalling channel.
The method according to claim 4, 
characterised

in that if within said predetermined
time the inband signalling on said signalling channel

converted to a traffic channel does not comprise
information indicating that the channel allocated for

use as a traffic channel between the base station and
subscriber stations is converted to a signalling

channel, the first subscriber station (MS1, 600) starts
to listen to the channels of the second base station

(BS2), searching for a signalling channel.
The method according to any one of claims
4 to 6, 
characterised
 in that said signalling
takes place on an inband signalling channel

of a traffic channel.
The method according to any one of claims
4 to 7, 
characterised
 in that said signalling
takes place on a channel-specific signalling 

channel implemented in a time slot of frequency divided
traffic channels.
The method according to any one of claims
4 to 7, 
characterised
 in that said signalling
takes place on an inband signalling channel (804,

Fig. 8) of a time-divided (801) traffic channel.
The method according to claim 9, 
characterised

in that said inband signalling
channel (804) of the time-divided (801) traffic channel

is an associated signalling channel (ASCH).
The method according to any one of the
preceding claims, 
characterised
 in that the
first subscriber station (MS1) sends a call set-up

request that contains signalling data to the radio system
before the radio system allocates said signalling

channel to another subscriber station (MS2, 600) for use
as a traffic channel, and the system stores (Fig. 4,

108) the signalling data transmitted by the first subscriber
station (MS1, 600).
The method according to claim 11, 
characterised

in that if said signalling channel
is released within a predetermined time, the radio

system establishes a telecommunication link in accordance
with said signalling data, continuing the connection

establishment between the subscriber station and
the radio system from where it ended when the signalling

channel was allocated to another subscriber station as
a traffic channel.
The method according to any one of the
preceding claims, 
characterised
 in that
said first subscriber station (MS1, 600) wants to

establish a telecommunication link with the mobile phone
