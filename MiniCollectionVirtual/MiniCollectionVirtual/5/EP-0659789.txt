<ABSTRACT>
The present invention discloses a novel polyurethane composition 
useful as a dispersing binder. The binder yields magnetic dispersions having high 

gloss values. Moreover, the polyurethane provides excellent hydrolytic stability. 
The polyurethane comprises a polyol, a diisocyanate a chain extender and an 

functional modifier formed of a reaction product of an aminodiol and Bronsted 
Acid.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a polyurethane composition. This
invention also relates to a dispersing binder for magnetic recording media made
from this polyurethane composition.Polymeric binders in conjunction with dispersing agents have been
used to coat magnetic particles on films such as polyester films and disks to form
magnetic recording media. High levels of the dispersing agent are usually
necessary due to inefficient coupling of the dispersing agent and magnetic
pigment. Drawbacks to the use of high levels of dispersing agent in conjunction
with the binder include bleeding of the dispersing agent and acceleration of the
hydrolytic degradation of the binder, which results in mechanical property
degradation.To overcome many of these drawbacks, various binders which
themselves are dispersing agents have come increasingly into use. Several patents
disclose a variety of such binders.U.S. -A- 3,490,945 ("Slovinsky") discloses a polyurethane
binder for magnetic recording media which itself is a dispersing agent. The
Slovinsky polyurethane binder is a moisture cured diisocyanate terminated
prepolymer containing tertiary or quaternary nitrogen.U.S. -A- 4,286,022 ("Vermillion") is directed to a solution
polymerized, hydroxyl terminated polyurethane block copolymer. The Vermillion
polyurethane block copolymer comprises polyester or polyether segments, short
chain aliphatic segments, 10-100 mole percent which contain tertiary and/or
quaternary nitrogen, and symmetrical unbranched aromatic urethane segments
interconnecting the polyester or polyether and short-chain aliphatic segments.U.S. -A- 5,089,344 discloses a magnetic recording medium
formed on a base comprising a magnetic powder and a binder. The binder 
consists of a reaction product of diol, a chain extender such as 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol,
a diisocyanate and a tertiary amine.U.S. -A- 5,124,424 also discloses a binder for magnetic
recording medium. The binder comprises a hydroxy-group terminated
polyurethane resin prepared by reaction of a polycarbonate polyol, a chain
extender, organic diisocyanate, and an active hydrogen compound having one or
more hydrophilic polar groups. The hydrophilic polar amino group may be a
tertiary amino group.EP-A-0 541 289 discloses a polyurethane composition comprising the
reaction product of quarternized bis-hydroxy alkylamines and polyisocyanates which
is chain-extended with an active-hydrogen containing compound, such as amines or
water.US-A-3,779,994 discloses a polyurethane made by mixing a
polyisocyanate with a
