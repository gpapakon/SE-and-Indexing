<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is directed to the use of an iron
hemoprotein in the preparation of a medicament for the
treatment of a deleterious physiological effect in an
animal caused by excess levels of nitric oxide synthesis. The
medicament may be prepared for the treatment of
conditions such as hypotension or septic shock.Endothelial cells have been shown to produce a
potent vasodilator known as Endothelium-Derived Relaxing
Factor (EDRF). Many naturally occurring substances which
act as physiological vasodilators mediate all or part of
their action by stimulating the release of EDRF.
Examples of such substances include acetylcholine,
histamine, bradykinin, leukotrienes, ADP, and ATP.
Recent studies have identified EDRF as nitric oxide, a
short lived, unstable compound (Ignarro et al., 1987,
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 84:9265-9269 and Palmer et
al., 1987, Nature 327:524-526).L-Arginine is the metabolic precursor of EDRF
(Schmidt et al., 1988, Eur. J. Pharmacol. 154:213-216).
NG-methyl-L-arginine is a competitive inhibitor of the
biosynthetic pathway of EDRF (Palmer et al., 1988, Nature
333:664-666). Administration of NG-methyl-L-arginine to
guinea pigs and rabbits has been shown to increase blood 
pressure (Aisaka et al., 1989, Biochem. Biophys. Res.
Commun. 160:881-886). Nitric oxide (NO) appears to be
synthesized from L-arginine by the enzyme, NO synthase;
the coproduct is L-citrulline (Moncada et al., 1991, J.
Cardiovascular Pharmacol. 17 (Suppl. 3):S1-S9). NO is an
endogenous stimulator for soluble guanylate cyclase.Nitric oxide has been found to be produced by
macrophages, endothelial cells, neutrophils, Kupffer
cells and hepatocytes, murine fibroblasts stimulated with
cytokines, and EMT-6 cells, a spontaneous murine mammary
adenocarcinoma cell line when treated with cytokine
(reviewed in Moncada et al., 1991, Pharmacol. Reviews
43:109-142). Specifically, macrophage cells become
activated by 12-36 hour treatments with gamma-interferon,
bacterial endotoxin and various cytokines (reviewed in
Collier and Vallance, 1989, Trends in Pharmacol. Sci.
10:427-431).Endothelial cells in the presence of gamma-interferon,
have been found to secrete large quantities
of arginine-derived nitrogen oxides after activation by
tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or endotoxin (Kilbourn and
Belloni, 1990, J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 82:772-776). TNF
causes marked hypotension in mammals (Tracey et al.,
1986, Gynecol. Obstet. 164:415-422; Old, 1985, Science
230:630-632). Additionally, TNF is thought to mediate
the vascular collapse resulting
