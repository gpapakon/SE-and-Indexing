<ABSTRACT>
A mixing device is constructed such that inserted, with a radial gap therebetween, into an outer casing (50), 
which has opening holes (51, 52, 170a and 180a) communicating with a hot-water supply passage, a water supply 

passage and a mixed water discharge passage, respectively, is a hollow inner casing (60), in which two primary side 
water passing holes communicating with the hot-water supply passage and the water supply passage, respectively, and 

a secondary side water passing hole communicating with the mixed water discharge passage are formed to extend from 
the outer surface of and through the hollow inner casing (60), and such that a separating member (77) is provided in 

the gap to define fluid passages (55, 176 and 184) between the outer casing (50) and the hollow inner casing (60). 
The whole or a part of the outer casing (50) is formed of a resin material such as engineering plastics.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hot and cold water 
mixing device for mixing hot water and cold water and 
delivering the mixed water, and more particularly, to a hot 
and cold water mixing device having features in the 
construction of the casing thereof. The hot and cold water mixing device such as a hot and 
cold water mixing faucet is formed therein with a hot water 
passage and a cold water passage, through which hot water 
and cold water flow, respectively, and at the same time, 
is formed with a mixing chamber therein for mixing the hot 
and cold water introduced and with a mixed water passage 
through which the mixed water is delivered, in order to mix 
the hot and cold water supplied from a hot water supply 
source and a cold water supply source, respectively, to 
deliver the mixed water having a desired temperature. These fluid passages have hitherto been formed by 
providing a body (casing) of a faucet made by casting, with 
partition walls therein, through integral moulding (for 
example, refer to JPB-58(1983)-40060). The body casing 
made by casting has an advantage in that the fluid passages 
therein can be formed in relatively free forms; however, 
there is a problem in that the body casing becomes large 
in configuration and also heavy in weight. A hot and cold water mixing device has, therefore, been 
developed in which the body casing is composed of a hollow 
metal pipe material in place of the body casing made by 
casting, and a hollow inner casing is inserted into the 
pipe material, fluid passages being formed in the gap 
between the pipe material and the inner casing (U.S. Patent 
No. 4,610,393).  In the hot and cold water mixing device comprising the 
pipe material and the inner casing inserted therein, the 
pipe material is provided with openings which communicate 
with a hot water supply passage, a cold water supply 
passage and a mixed water delivery passage, and further, 
the inner casing is also provided with water holes which 
communicate with the hot water supply passage, water supply 
passage and mixed water delivery passage. Further, the 
openings of the pipe material and the water holes of the 
inner casing are disposed with the respective passages 
corresponding to the hot water supply passage, cold water 
supply passage and mixed water delivery passage being close 
to each other, and seal members (O-rings) are provided 
between the respective openings and the water holes in the 
circumferential direction, so that the hot water passage, 
mixed water passage and cold
