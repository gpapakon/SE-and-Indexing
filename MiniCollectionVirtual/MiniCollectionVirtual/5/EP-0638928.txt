<ABSTRACT>
In the case of power semiconductor elements having pressure contact, contact surfaces which have different coefficients of thermal expansion lie on top of one another. This can lead to welding of the contact surfaces due to friction. Friction is kept at a low level by providing the contact surfaces (4, 6) with a layer (7, 8) which consists of an amorphous carbon-metal compound. The latter has a lower coefficient of friction with small resistivity.
