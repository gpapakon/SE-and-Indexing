<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for gas-phase cryotherapy, characterised in that it comprises in combination:   - a pressurised liquefied carbon dioxide bottle (1) mounted in a framework (2) facilitating its movement and its handling, a connector (4) extending in a dip tube (5) running over practically the entire length of the bottle being screwed onto the head of the bottle, - a flexible pipe (6) which withstands the liquefaction pressure of the carbon dioxide and is connected at one end to the said connector and, at the other end, to a system (7) for pressure-reduction and ejection of the gasified carbon dioxide, - the said pressure-reduction and ejection system being composed of a valve actuated by an external control lever, the chamber located downstream with respect to this valve extending in an outlet tube having a section with small diameter so that, because of the inherent speed of the gas passing through it and expanding therein, practically no solid carbon dioxide is formed, - the said outlet tube being equipped with means for changing the temperature, pressure and dimensions of the gaseous carbon dioxide jet sprayed onto the region of the patient to be treated.

Equipment for gas-phase cryotherapy, which comprises, in combination:

a bottle (1) of carbon dioxide liquefied under pressure, mounted on a trolley
(2) to facilitate its movement and handling, with a connector (4) screwed to

the head of the said bottle, the said connector ending in an immersion tube (5)
which extends down into and along almost the entire length of the bottle,
a flexible tube (6) which can withstand the liquefaction pressure of carbon
dioxide and which is connected at one end to the said connector and at the

other end to a pressure-drop and outlet system (7) for the gaseous carbon
dioxide,
the said pressure-drop and outlet system consisting of a valve activated by
an external control hand-lever (13), a chamber (21) situated downstream from

this valve and extending into a outlet tube (23) with a cross-section of small
diameter (30) such that by virtue of the actual velocity of the gas passing

through it while expanding almost no dry ice is formed,
the said outlet tube being fitted with means (25) to modulate the
temperature, the pressure and the size of the gaseous carbon dioxide jet

projected onto the area of the patient to be treated.
Equipment according to Claim 1,
characterized in that

the said means consist of a sleeve (25) concentric with the said tube, and
having at its upstream end orifices (26) to draw in air by the Venturi effect, the

quantity of this air drawn in and consequently the temperature and pressure
prevailing in the said area being dependent on the number of such orifices, and

the size of the said jet depending on the diameter of the said sleeve.
Equipment according to Claims 1 and 2,
characterized in that

in addition, it comprises means to sense continuously the temperature of the
patient's skin in the area treated, and to alert the practitioner to that

temperature.
