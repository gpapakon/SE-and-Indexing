<ABSTRACT>
The heat insulating material has high porosity, at least in the region between its ends (2) which border against the composite profile section (6). The support section (1) is made of a high-strength material, e.g. polyamide, on and/or in which the regions of higher porosity material (3) are arranged. The support section is continuous between the ends. When installed, the support section of the insulating bridge between the profiles faces outwards. The increased porosity or volume increase is achieved by chemical and/or physical after-treatment, for example by spraying water on the still-soft plastic, or by use of chemical substances. The support section and region of higher porosity are co-extruded. The insulating bridging section has a transverse web (4) of a material of higher porosity. The porous material of the insulating bridging section and of the transverse web are the same and they are built in one piece.

<CLAIMS>
Insulating web (5) of thermally insulating material, particularly synthetic material, for composite profiles of window or door frames or facade constructions, which comprises a support part (1) with two insert ends (2),wherein the support part (1) together with the two insert ends (2) forms a receptacle (3) which extends between the insert ends (2) and is trough-shaped in cross-section, and the support part (1) consists of a first material of high strength, particularly polyamide, and a second material with high porosity is arranged at the support part (1),
characterised
in that
 the receptacle (3), which is trough-shaped in cross-section, of the support part (1) is completely filled between the insert ends (2) with the second material of high porosity and the insulating web comprises at least one transverse web (4) of the second material of high porosity, wherein the transverse web (4) and the second material in the trough-shaped receptacle (3) are formed integrally and the second material of high porosity in the trough-shaped receptacle (3) are produced by coextrusion.
Insulating web according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the second material in the trough-shaped receptacle (3) consists of polymeric material, particularly modified PPO/PA mixture.
Insulating web according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 the first and/or second material contains a proportion of glass-fibre.
