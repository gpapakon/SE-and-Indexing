<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pigment
composition which shows excellent fluidity and stability
with time when dispersed in a vehicle for a printing ink
such as a gravure ink or an offset ink or in a vehicle for a
coating composition and which imparts the printing ink or
coating composition with excellent gloss; a printing ink
comprising the pigment composition and a vehicle; and a
coating composition comprising the pigment composition and a
vehicle.A phthalocyanine pigment has clear color tone and
high tinting strength. However, it is known that it is
difficult to obtain a stable dispersion of a phthalocyanine
pigment in a vehicle for an offset ink, a gravure ink or a
coating composition and that a phthalocyanine pigment causes
crucial problems on the value of a product quality.For example, a dispersion of a pigment formed of
fine particles is liable to show a high viscosity, and it is
hence difficult to take a product (a printing ink or a
coating composition) from a dispersing apparatus or
transport the product. Further, the above dispersion
sometimes undergoes gelation when stored, and such a
gelled dispersion is no longer usable. In some cases, fine
particles of the pigment are liable to form aggregates and
the aggregates may precipitate in a vehicle. Moreover,
a printing ink or a coating composition as a product may
have or show defective states such as a decrease in the
gloss or the tinting strength and a defective leveling.A separate problem having nothing to do with the pigment dispersion, 
is that a phthalocyanine pigment shows a phenomenon involving a
change in its crystal state. That is, in a non-aqueous
vehicle for an offset ink, a gravure ink or a coating
composition, particles of the pigment unstable with regard
to energy morphologically change to bring themselves into a
stable state. As a result, coarse particles occur in the
vehicle, the hue of a printing or a coating greatly changes,
or the tinting strength of the pigment decreases to impair
the commercial value of a product.For overcoming the above problems, several methods
have been already proposed. For example, as a method
effective to some extent, Japanese Patent Publications Nos.
39-28884 and 40-4143, JP-A-52-33922, JP-A-57-12067 and
JP-A-3-33166 disclose methods in which a phthalocyanine
pigment is mixed with an organic amine salt of
phthalocyanine sulfonic acid. In these methods, the size
and form of crystal particles do not change much, while the
printing or coating sometimes has insufficient gloss, and in
many cases, the
