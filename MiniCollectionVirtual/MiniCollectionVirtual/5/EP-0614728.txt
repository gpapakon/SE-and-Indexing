<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a vice (1) for holding a workpiece (2) having two clamping jaws (11, 12) displaceable relative to one another, the first clamping jaw (11) of which is equipped with a carrier (13) for the second clamping jaw (12), the latter is mounted on the carrier so as to be displaceable to a limited extent by means of an intermediate member (support plate 15) and is supported on the first clamping jaw (11) via an over-compressible compression spring (20). In addition, the carrier (13) can be selectively coupled to an adjusting member (slide 21). By virtue of this configuration, the vice (1) can be easily opened by mechanical means and can be coupled to the adjusting member in any desired position. Shifting of a workpiece (2) can thus be effected in a short time, enabling working operations to proceed automatically.

<CLAIMS>
Vice (1) for holding a workpiece (2) with two chuck jaws (11, 12) which 

can be moved in relation to one another, with the first chuck jaw (11) 
having a carrier (13) for the second chuck jaw (12) and this after being 

mounted on the carrier (13) in such a way as to allow it to move within 
limits by means of an adapter (15) and supported on it by a 

compression spring (20) acting in the direction of the first chuck jaw (11) 
with the possibility of pressing over the compression spring (20) using a 

servo device (41 or 61),
characterised in that,
 
the carrier (13) can optionally be linked to an adjuster (21), for example 

a moving slide, there being a guide rail (23) fitted with wedge-shaped 
surfaces (25, 25') attached to the adjuster (21) in order to connect the  

 
carrier (13) to the adjuster (21), and the carrier (13) having two clamping 

pieces (26, 27) between which the guide rail (23) can be clamped. 
Vice in accordance with Claim 1,
characterised in that,
 
one of the clamping pieces (27) of the carrier (13) is formed as a chuck 

jaw in a rotating mount and can be clamped against the guide rail (23) 
of the adjuster (21) by the force of a compression spring (30). 
Vice in accordance with Claim 2,
characterised in that,
 
the chuck jaw (27) is provided with an insert (32) which is in a rotating 

mounting and forms the clamping surface. 
Vice in accordance with one or more of Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that,
 
a servo device (51) to which a pressurised medium can be applied and 

taking the form of a collet (52) is provided in order to release the 
clamped connection between the carrier (13) and the adjuster (21) by 

acting on the chuck jaw (27) in its swivelling mounting.  
 
Vice in accordance with one or more of Claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that,
 
a servo device (61) acting in the direction of the adjuster (21) and taking 

the form of a plate (62) in an adjustable arrangement is provided in 
order to press over all the compression springs (20) assigned to each of 

the second chuck jaws (12) of several vices (1), with it being possible to 
activate the servo device (61) using one or more adjusting pistons (67) 

inserted in cylinders (66) and pressurised by a pressurised medium. 
Vice in accordance with Claim 5,
characterised in that,
 
the plate (62) is articulated on a fixed part (3) by means of levers in the 

form of a parallelogram linkage, and that each of the adjusting pistons 
(67) inserted in several cylinders (66) aligned in the longitudinal 

direction of the plate (62) acts on a lever (63) in the area of the 
articulation point of the lever (63) on the plate (62). 
Vice in accordance with Claim 5 or Claim 6,
characterised in that,
 
the plate (62) is supported against the first chuck jaw (11) of the vices 

(1) when pressing across the compression springs (20) assigned to the 
second chuck jaw (12).  

 
Vice in accordance with Claim 7,
characterised in that,
 
an adjustable support (71) is assigned to the plate (62) in order to 

support it and the support (71) can be placed against the first chuck jaw 
(12) of the vices (1). 
Vice in accordance with Claim 8,
characterised in that,
 
one or more hoses (74) or similar which can be flexibly deformed by a 

pressurised medium, preferably compressed air, are provided in order 
to apply the force acting against the springs (73) of an adjustable 

support (71).
