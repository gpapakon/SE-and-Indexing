<ABSTRACT>
In a condenser which is mounted in an adjusting device for a displacement into a plane normal to an optical axis (2) and which is adjustable in the direction of the optical axis (2), the condenser is accommodated in a condenser body (1) which is mounted so as to be guided displaceably in the adjusting device in the direction of the optical axis (2) and in the plane which is normal to the optical axis (2), as a result of which an adjustment of the condenser in the direction of the optical axis (2) can be performed without providing an additional drive.
