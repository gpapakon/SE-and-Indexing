<ABSTRACT>
A hair restorer which comprises a carrier and an 
effective amount(s) of one or more compounds selected from the 

group consisting of 3-[4-hydroxy-3,5-bis(3-methyl-2-butenyl)phenyl]-2-propenoic 

acid, benzenpropanoic acid 4-(2-carboxyethenyl)-2-(3-methyl-2-butenyl)phenylester, 
and their 

salts as an effective ingredient. These effective ingredients 
exert a strong activity on the growth and regeneration of hair. 

Thus, the hair restorer is satisfactorily used in the treatment 
and prevention of alopecia and falling hair.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel hair
restorer, more particularly, to a hair restorer which comprises
a carrier and an effective amount(s) of one or more compounds
selected from the group consisting of 3-[4-hydroxy-3,5-bis(3-methyl-2-butenyl)phenyl]-2-propenoic
acid, benzenpropanoic acid
4-(2-carboxyethenyl)-2-(3-methyl-2-butenyl)phenylester, and
their salts, as well as to the preparation of said hair
restorer.Keeping hair rich during our life-time is one of our
common wishes. The present inventors had studied propolis
extract and its functions. As a result, we had established a
purified propolis extract, which exerts an activity on the
growth of hair, as well as its preparation and uses, and
disclosed them in Japanese Patent Application No.269,038/92.
The reality of the substance(s) exerting such an activity,
however, had not yet been revealed. It has been in great
demand to reveal the substance(s) and establish a hair restorer
which exerts a strong activity on the growth of hair without
a fear of causing side effects.An aim of the present invention is to provide a 
hair restorer which comprises a carrier and a compound(s) as
an effective ingredient capable of exerting a strong activity
on the growth and regeneration of hair without a fear of
causing side effects.In order to attain the aforesaid object, the present
inventors have eagerly studied on propolis extract. As a
result, we found that 3-[4-hydroxy-3,5-bis(3-methyl-2-butenyl)phenyl]-2-propenoic
acid (designated as "compound (1)"
hereinafter) and benzenpropanoic acid 4-(2-carboxyethenyl)-2-(3-methyl-2-butenyl)phenylester
(designated as "compound (2)"
hereinafter) exert a strong activity on the growth and
regeneration of hair. Based on this finding, the present
inventors further studied and established a hair restorer which
comprises a carrier and an effective amount(s) of one or more
compounds selected from the group consisting of 3-[4-hydroxy-3,5-bis(3-methyl-2-butenyl)phenyl]-2-propenoic
acid,
benzenpropanoic acid 4-(2-carboxyethenyl)-2-(3-methyl-2-butenyl)phenylester,
and their salts, more particularly, we
established cosmetic- and pharmaceutical-compositions which
exert a strong activity on the growth and regeneration of hair,
and accomplished this invention.Thus, the present invention relates to a hair
restorer which comprises a carrier and an effective amount(s)
of one or more members selected from the compounds (1) and (2) 
as well as their salts, and to the preparation of said hair
restorer.The present invention will now be
