<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing a preform (40) includes the deposition of powder binder (25) onto chopped glass fibers (19) that are on a preform screen (14). The powder binder and chopped glass fibers are then heated to soften the particles of binder and make them stick to the glass fibers to form the preform.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD OF FORMING A PREFORM USING A POWDERBINDERTECHNICAL FIELDThis invention relates generally to directed fiber preforming and, more particularly, to an improved process for forming a glass fiber preform.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONGlass fibers have been commonly incorporated in thermoplastic molded objects and other cured plastics for added strength and durability. The glass fiber is introduced in a mold where resinous plastic is then injected such that the glass fibers become imbedded into the final formed object. It has been found advantageous to form a preform of the final object out of glass fibers and place the preform into the mold. The glass fibers are often chopped and blown onto a preform screen. Immediately following the fiber placement, a liquid binder agent is sprayed on and allowed to cure which sets the fibers in place.The use of a liquid binder coats substantially the entire chopped glass fiber which can prevent matrix 

resin in the molded part from fully wetting-out the fibers in the preform. This lack of penetration of the matrix resin into the fiberglass strand within the preform for the finished molded part restricts its mechanical strength and integrity.What is needed is a method for adding a binder to the preform fibers that prevents substantial coating of the fibers so that the preform is more supple during handling thus improving its integrity and such that the later added matrix resin in the subsequent molding process more fully wets out the fibers of the preform.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONIn accordance with one aspect of the inven¬ tion, chopped fibrous material, such as chopped glass fibers, are deposited on a preform screen. The fibers may be retained on the screen by a vacuum draw there¬ through. A solid particulate binder material, commonly referred to as a powder, is deposited onto the deposited chopped fibers. The particulate binder are retained on the deposited glass fibers. The particles of binder may be retained by static electrical charges on either the binder particles or glass fibers or both. 

 The binder particles can be softened while on the deposited fibers such that the fibers are adhered to the fibers independently of the electro-static charge. The softening of the binder particles also allows fibers to adhere to other fibers via the binder particles. The softening of the binder particles may be by applying heat to a binder made from a thermoplastic polyester material such that upon softening it becomes tacky and sticks to the adjacent glass fibers.

CLAIMS
The embodiments in which an exclusive property or privilege is claimed are defined as follow.
1. A process of manufacturing a preform comprising the steps of; depositing chopped fibrous strands onto a preform base member; depositing solid particulate binder material made from solid particles onto said deposited chopped fibrous strands; softening said particles of particulate binder retained on said fibrous to adhere the chopped fibrous strands to the particles and to other fibrous strands; re-solidifying said particles such that said chopped fibrous strands adhered to said particles form a preform.
2. A process for manufacturing a preform as defined in claim 1 wherein the depositing of solid particulate binder includes using electrostatic charge on said particles to retain said particulate binder on said fibrous strands. 


 3. A process for manufacturing a preform as defined in claim 2 wherein said particulate binder is blown onto said fibrous strands.
4. A process for manufacturing a preform as defined claim 1 wherein said particulate binder is made from a thermoplastic polyester material.
5. A process for manufacturing a preform as defined in claim 4 wherein said softening of said particles includes heating said particulate binder.
6. A process for manufacturing a preform as defined in claim 5 wherein said fibrous strands are made from glass fibers.
7. A process for manufacturing a preform as defined in claim 1 wherein said softening of said particles includes heating said particulate binder.
8. A process for manufacturing a preform as defined in claim 1 wherein said fibrous strands are made from glass fibers.
