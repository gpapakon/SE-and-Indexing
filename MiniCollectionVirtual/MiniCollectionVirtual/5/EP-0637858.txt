<ABSTRACT>
The circuit board connector has one contact plug (2) e.g. a male contact arranged on one circuit board (1), and another contact plug, e.g. a female contact (4), arranged on another circuit board (3). The circuit boards are arranged at right angles to each other. The first contact plug is surrounded by a metal screening element (5) which is inserted via pins into holes in the first circuit board. The screening element of the first contact plug (2) comprises a rigid, rectangular frame which is attached to the first circuit board via insert pins. The inside surface of the frame includes metal contact elements (10, 11). Screening cases (20, 21) of the second contact are attached to the second circuit board via insert pins (24, 25). The screening case (21) encloses the underside of the second plug body including the electrical contacts on the underside of the second circuit board.

Printed circuit board plug connector having a 
first connector strip (2), for example a male connector 

strip, arranged on a first printed circuit board (1) and 
having a second connector strip (4), for example a female 

connector strip, which is arranged on a second printed 
circuit board (3) which is perpendicular to the first 

printed circuit board (1), having the following features: 

a) at its side, the first connector strip (2) is surrounded 
by a metal screening element (5) which is 

inserted by pins (7) into holes in the first printed 
circuit board (1), 
b) the screening element (5) is designed with inwardly 
cambered, resilient contact elements (10, 11), 
c) the second connector strip (4) is arranged such that 
it lies in an edge region of the second printed circuit 

board (3) and projects at the longitudinal edge (22) of 
the printed circuit board, and is enclosed by two metal 

screening shells (20, 21) inserted into holes in the 
second printed circuit board (3), 
d) one screening shell (20) is designed in such a way 
that it completely encloses the second connector strip 

(4) on the top side of the second printed circuit board 
(3), except for the plug-in face, 
 
characterized by the further features: 


e) the screening element (5) of the first connector strip 
(2) is designed as a rigid, rectangular, closed peripheral 

frame which is attached to the first printed 
circuit board (1) by means of press-fit pins (7), 
f) peripheral metal sheets which are feathered at close  
 

spacings are attached, as inner contact elements (10, 
11), to the inside of the longitudinal and transverse 

walls (5a and 5b, respectively) of the frame (5), 
g) the screening shells (20, 21) of the second connector 
strip (4) are attached to the second printed circuit 

board (3) by means of press-fit pins (24, 25) from 
opposite sides of the second printed circuit board (3), 
h) the screening shell (21) which is attached to the 
second printed circuit board (3) from the underside is 

designed in such a way that it covers the second 
connector-strip body (28) on the underside thereof, 

including the electrical connections thereof which 
project at the underside of the second printed circuit 

board (3). 
Printed circuit board plug connector according to 
Claim 1, characterized in that mutually opposing press-fit
