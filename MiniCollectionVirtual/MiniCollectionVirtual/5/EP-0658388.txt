<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for the 
damped elastic support of rotating bars, particularly for 
bar feeders. It is known that in bar feeders for machine tools, and 
specifically for automatic lathes with one or more 
spindles, the bars rotate within supports that allow them 
to advance due to the thrust applied by specifically 
provided bar pushers. The supports can be constituted by 
closed or openable bushes: in the first ones, the bar to be 
machined is inserted axially, whereas in the second ones it 
is inserted laterally after opening the supports. In the case of feeders for single-spindle lathes, the 
supports are mounted on a fixed base; in feeders for 
multispindle lathes, the supports are instead mounted on a 
rotating beam and are angularly distributed so that the 
bushes are coaxial to the various spindles. Since it is impossible in practice to provide bushes 
that can support and guide all bar types in terms of cross-section 
and diameter, the bushes are generally sized so 
that they can support and guide multiple ranges of bars 
having different cross-sections and diameters. This requirement unavoidably entails some drawbacks, 
especially when the bars are narrow or have a diameter that 
is smaller than the diameter of the bushes or have a 
polygonal cross-section. In these cases the bars in fact 
generate extremely unpleasant vibrations and noise that can 
be contrasted by providing screens of sound-deadening 
material, accordingly entailing additional costs.  A principal aim of the present invention is therefore 
to provide a device that can obviate the drawbacks 
described above and observed in known feeders but with a 
manufacturing cost that is totally irrelevant if compared 
with the systems currently being used. According to the invention, there is provided a device 
for neutralizing vibrations generated by rotating bars, 
particularly for bar feeders, which is characterized in 
that it comprises elastic damping elements which are 
interposed between said bar guiding supports and the plane 
on which said supports are coupled. The particular characteristics and advantages of the 
present invention will become apparent from the following 
detailed description of some preferred embodiments thereof, 
illustrated only by way of non-limitative example in the 
accompanying drawings, wherein: 
figure 1 is a view of a support according to a first 
embodiment of the invention; figure 2 is a view of a portion of a feeder equipped 
with the supports of figure 1; figure 3 is a view
