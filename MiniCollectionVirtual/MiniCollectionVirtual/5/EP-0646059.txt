<ABSTRACT>
A method of treating laminated objects of plastics that have been damaged by osmosis or the like and which contain liquids and/or gases within laminate layers. Particularly within the damaged area the object is given such a temperature by controlled heating, that liquids are evaporated and gases are expanded in such a manner that covering layers are broken up and the damaged portion is exposed but also in such a manner that the damaged portion is not enduringly heated to a temperature exceeding 300  DEG C. Preferably the heating is combined with exertion of a mechanical force against the object in way to remove the material which has been loosened due to the heating.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of curing preferably
so called osmosis which may exist in practically all
objects manufactured from plastics laminates. When osmosis
is noted into such an extent that the objects are damaged this
is normally referred to as that the objects have been hit by
bubonic plague, plastics plague, glass fibre hull plague or
osmosis. This latter term will be used hereinafter.One type of objects that is frequently exposed to osmosis
is plastics boats. Cfr for instance Båtnytt nr 10/1990 page
28 -31. Therefore, the description below will refer to the
treatment of boats, although it is generally applicable.It is not clear why osmosis does not occur always, or why
a chemical acid generating process starts in some cases but
not in other cases. However, it is clear that osmosis in many
cases is a big problem.It has been speculated about if the reason for osmosis
is that there might be some constituents of the water that are
active and that the bottom paint or dust that has contaminated
the surface of the object during the manufacture functions as
a catalyst.The damages manifest themselves in that the acid, beyond
forming gas blisters outwardly, also corrode inwardly. The size
of the gas blister gives no sure indication on how big the
damage is that is concealed within the hull. The extent of the
damages will be evident only when these have been exposed.In order to cure damages resulting from osmosis it is
necessary
1. to localized all the damaged areas2. to expose the damages3. to remove both the formed acid and the damaged laminate
material4. to clean up and dry out5. to build up the laminate to the original hull thickness
and strength6. to restore the hull on the outer surface by means of
a water tight layer, such as gel coat or a migh molecular
epoxy.It is known that it is possible to use a drying equipment 
of hyper absorption type, in the following referred to as hyab-equipment,
for effectively drying laminate that has been made
moist, such as at blasting or washing. Cfr. for instance Båtnytt
nr 10/1990 page 29. In the article it is referred to
drying by means of the hyab-equipment as "hyper drying by means
of compressed air and bottle gas heat".The hyab-equipments use compressed air and bottle gas in
combination with each other and the drying medium consists of
a dry, hot air flow that sweeps along the object at a high
velocity.The drying method of the hyab-equipments is based on the
fact that the moisture is effectively removed from an object
in that the surface thereof

<CLAIMS>
A method of treating laminated objects of plastic which
have been damaged for instance by osmosis or the like and

thus contains liquids and/or gases in laminated layers,

characterized by
 the following steps.

a. The object, preferably in the damaged area, by a controlled

heating is given such a temperature that liquids
are evaporated and gases are expanded in such a manner that

overlaying layers are broken up and the damaged area is
exposed but such that the damaged area is not lastingly

heated to a temperature over 300°C;
b. The damaged area is alternatingly heated and cooled
until all acid and other contaminants within the material

have been removed, whereby the heating is performed in a
similar way as in step a;
c. The damaged area is cleaned by mechanical force;
d. The damaged area is restored.
A method as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in
 that
the cooling of the exposed damaged area is achieved by e.g.

compressed air that has been chilled by expansion.
A method as claimed in claim 1 and 2 
characterized in

that the mechanical force is achieved by a concentrated
compressed air jet.
A method as claimed in one of claims 1 - 3, 
characterized
in
 that the heating is combined with the mechanical
force by which the object is subjected to such an effect

that the material that has been freed through the heating
is removed.
A method as claimed in one of claims 1 - 4, 
characterized 
in
 that a compressed air jet generated e.g. in a
nozzle at a pressure of 4 bar or higher, is blown towards

the surface in such a manner that a strongest possible
mechanical action is brought about within the damaged area

under such control that the area is given the desired
temperature for heating or cooling, respectively.
A method as claimed in one of claims 1 - 5, 
characterized
in
 that the object is high pressure cleaned and
dried, preferably by means of a drying equipment of the

hyperabsorption type to a moisture content not exceeding
20% relative humudity.
A method as claimed in one of claims 1 - 6, 
characterized
by
 the following steps:

a. washing of the object
b. drying of the object
