<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an information
storage disc practiced illustratively as a magnetic disc
or optical disc, as well as to an information recording
and reproducing apparatus practiced illustratively as a
disc drive unit in a mass storage device for use with a
data processing system, the disc and the apparatus being
used for recording and reproducing information thereto
and therefrom.Fig. 1 is a view showing the positional relations
of a read head and a write head with respect to the
tracks on a disc in a conventional magnetic disc unit.
A rotating arm 2 rotating around an arm axis 1 is
equipped with the write head W and the read head R. As
arrowed in the figure, the magnetic disc 3 rotates
counterclockwise. The read head R is located upstream
of the write head W. The tracks on the magnetic disc 3 are divided into
a plurality of sectors. Each sector is split into a
servo data storage area and a data storage area. At the
beginning of each data storage area is an ID storage are
in which a sector number and track numbers are first
written by use of the write head W. The read head R
reads each sector number and track number. If the
location read by the read head R is the desired location
(i.e., in the desired sector on the desired track), data
is written by the write head W to that region in the
data storage area which follows the ID storage area.As illustrated in Fig. 1, the write head W and
read head R are arranged to be positioned in an aligned
manner on track 4, the innermost track. That is, on the
innermost track 4, the radial distance L1 between the
write head W and the read head R is very small (close to
0). As a result, when the write head W is positioned on
the outermost track 5, the read head R is dislodged from
the track 5 by a distance L2.Fig. 2 is an enlarged view of part of what is
shown in Fig. 1. The write head W and the read head R
are shown to be positioned on the innermost track 4, on
the outermost track 5 and on an intermediate track 6.
Suppose that the write head W is positioned on a given 
track. In that case, as illustrated, the farther the
track on which the write head W is positioned from the
disc center, the greater the dislodged distance of the
read head R from that track. Conversely, if the read
head R is correctly positioned on the target track, the
write head W is dislodged from that track
correspondingly.Generally, to write data on the disc requires
positioning the write head W at the center of the target
track. With the write head W thus positioned, the
center of
