<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to thrust reversal installations for jet aircraft. The installation includes, for each door, at least one safety lock (15) situated on the upstream frame of the cowling (1) and a safety lock (25) situated in a transverse plane which is distinct and remote from the first lock, especially on the lateral edge of the longitudinal spur (3) of the cowling. The invention gives an increase in safety even in the event of accidental damage to part of the cowling.

A thrust-reversal installation with doors for an
aircraft engine of the jet type, said installation

comprising a series of pivoting doors (9) articulated about
axis (12) in a stationary structure of a fairing

surrounding the engine more or less concentrically with the
longitudinal axis (X-X) of said engine, said doors (9)

being capable of pivoting, under the action of a control
actuator (13), between a stowed so-called "cruise" position

in which they close off openings (5) made in the stationary
structure of the fairing, and a deployed so-called

"reversal" position in which said doors (9) project
radially outward from the fairing, freeing said openings

via which the flow of propulsive gas may be deflected
radially outward, said reversal installation including a

door safety system intended to prevent the inadvertent
deployment of the reverser doors, said safety system being

made up, for each door (9), of at least two independent
locks (15, 25) acting respectively between the stationary

structure of the fairing (6, 8) and a part of the door (9),
said installation being characterized in that the locks

(15, 25) associated with each door (9) are, on the one
hand, separated from one another in the direction of the

longitudinal axis (X-X) of the engine so as to be located
within two distinct and separated cross planes and, on the

other hand, associated respectively with circuits for
controlling the deployment, the circuits being independent

of one another.
The reversal installation as claimed in claim 1,
in which the doors (9) and the openings (5) in the fairing

in which they are housed have a somewhat rectangular
overall shape, characterized in that the two locks (15, 25)

are located respectively on two adjacent sides (6, 8) of
each fairing opening (5).
The installation as claimed in claims 1 and 2 in
which the stationary fairing structure comprises an 

upstream (with respect to the direction of flow (F) of the
gases) annular frame (2) and longitudinal beams (3)

respectively delimiting the upstream and lateral edges (6,
8) of the openings (5) in the fairing, characterized in

that one of the locks (15) is mounted on the upstream
annular frame (2) in order to interact with a complementary

element (16) of the upstream edge (10) of the door (9),
while the other lock (25) is mounted on a longitudinal beam

(3) in order to interact with a complementary lock element
(26) formed in the lateral edge (11) of the door.
The installation as claimed in claim 3, in which
the door axis (12) are housed in the longitudinal beams

(3), characterized in that the locks -(25) mounted on the
beams (3) are situated in the space lying between the door

axis (12) and the upstream annular frame (2).
The installation as claimed in claim 4,
characterized in that the distance (d) between the lock

(25) and the upstream frame (2) is less than or equal to
half the distance (D) between the upstream frame (2) and

the door axis (12).
The installation as claimed in any of claims 4 or
5, characterized in that the lock (25) is situated at a

distance (d) from the upstream frame (2) which lies between
half and a quarter of the distance (D) between the upstream

frame (2) and the door axis (12).
The installation as claimed in claim 6,
characterized in that the complementary lock element (26)

is situated at a distance (d) from the upstream door edge
(10) which lies between half and a quarter of the distance

(D) between the upstream edge (10) and the door axis (12).
The installation as claimed in any of claims 3 to
7, characterized in that the lock (25) mounted on the

fairing beam (3) has the shape of a pivoting hook (28), and
the complementary lock element (26) borne by the door is a

stationary stub.
The installation as claimed in any of claims 3 to
8, characterized in that, in the door-closed position, the 

lock (25) mounted on the fairing beam (3), once in
engagement with the complementary lock element (26), is

held fast in position by an automatic immobilizing
mechanism (35) which can be released only through a

deliberate action on a control circuit independent of the
actuation of the lock (25).
The installation as claimed in any of the
preceding claims, in which the pivoting of the doors (9) is

achieved by actuators (13), each door (9) being coupled to
an actuator (13), characterized in that said actuator

itself constitutes a third safety lock for preventing the
inadvertent deployment of the door by virtue of a locking

means (14) which it contains.
