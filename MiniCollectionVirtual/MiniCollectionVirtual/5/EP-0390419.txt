<ABSTRACT>
A smoking article which comprises tobacco treated 
with a high loading level of humectant and which has been 

expanded by a high level expansion process to produce 
expanded tobacco having a humectant loading level in the 

range of 4% to 15%. The particulate matter, water, 
nicotine and humectant free (PMWNHF) to nicotine delivery 

ratio of smoking articles according to the invention and 
smoked under standard machine smoking conditions is not 

more than 8 to 1.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention the subject of this application relates 
to cigarettes and similar smoking articles. The use of humectant in the tobacco of smoking articles 
is illustrated in European Patent Application, Publication 
No. 0 067 601. The use of expanded tobacco in smoking 
articles is also known. US Patent No. 4,310,006 describes a 
high order expansion process utilising liquid carbon dioxide 
as the expansion agent. The tobacco is prior treated with 
humectant before expansion to lower the freezing point of the 
tobacco. However, conventional levels of expanded tobacco in 
the tobacco blend of a smoking article are usually of the 
order of less than 30%, and usually less than 25%, by weight 
of the tobacco in the smoking article, even in those markets 
where the weight of the cigarette is of great importance, 
because of the lack of taste and flavour characteristics. It is an object of the subject invention to provide a 
cigarette which is of a low tar delivery but which is 
sensorily acceptable to the smoker. The subject invention provides a smoking article 
comprising cut tobacco and a paper wrapper circumscribing 
said tobacco, a major portion at least of said tobacco having been treated 
with a humectant to provide a loading level of said humectant 
of 6% to 15% by weight of said tobacco, said tobacco 
comprising expanded tobacco, the packing density of said 
tobacco rod not exceeding 210 mg/cc, and wherein, when said  
 
article is smoked under 
standard machine smoking conditions, the particulate matter delivery on a water, nicotine and humectant free 
basis to nicotine delivery ratio is not more than 6 to 1. Suitably, the loading level of the humectant on the tobacco 
does not exceed 12%. More suitably, the loading level is in the range of 7 - 10%, 9% for example. The humectant is suitably one or more of glycerol, propylene glycol, sorbitol and diethylene glycol. Advantageously, the humectant is applied to the tobacco prior to the tobacco being subjected to an expansion 
process. The loading level of the humectant on the tobacco prior to expansion may be in a range of 
about 5% to about 20% in order to result in a post expansion level of 4% to 15%. We have found that if the humectant is applied to the tobacco before rather than after the tobacco is subjected 
to the expansion process, a reduction in tobacco strand length during the process is avoided. Further 
advantages of applying the humectant prior to expansion reside in the avoidance of an undesirably high equilibrium 
moisture content post

<CLAIMS>
A smoking article comprising a tobacco rod, which rod 
comprises cut tobacco and a paper wrapper circumscribing 

said tobacco, a major portion at least of said tobacco having been 
treated with a humectant to provide a loading level of 

said humectant of 6% to 15% by weight of said tobacco, 
said tobacco comprising expanded tobacco, the packing 

density of said tobacco rod not exceeding 210 mg/cc, and 
wherein, when said article is smoked under standard 

machine smoking conditions, the particulate matter 
delivery on a water, nicotine and humectant free basis 

to nicotine delivery ratio is not more than 6 to 1. 
A smoking article according to Claim 1, wherein said 
loading level is not less than 7%. 
A smoking article according to Claim 1 or 2, wherein 
said loading level does not exceed 12%. 
A smoking article according to Claim 3, wherein said 
loading level does not exceed 10%. 
A smoking article according to any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein the humectant is one or more of 

glycerol, propylene glycol, sorbitol and diethylene 
glycol. 
A smoking article according to any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein the bulk density of said tobacco which 

has been expanded is from about 100 mg/cc to about 200 
mg/cc.  

 
A smoking article according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the expanded tobacco of said 
rod comprises at least 65% of the whole of the tobacco of said rod. 
A smoking article according to Claim 7, wherein said expanded tobacco was treated with humectant prior 
to expansion.
