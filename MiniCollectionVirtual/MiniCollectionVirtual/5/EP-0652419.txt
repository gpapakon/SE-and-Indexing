<ABSTRACT>
From two distance-or angle-dependent signals (sinusoidal and cosinusoidal track) generated by one sensor, which have a phase displacement which differs from the ideal phase displacement of 90 DEG , an angle ( phi 1) is calculated by means of interpolation electronics (1), which angle is corrected in a phase correction stage (2, 3). In this phase correction stage (2, 3), an error factor is generated by accessing a table, which factor is multiplied by a phase error angle so that a correction angle ( DELTA  phi ) is obtained which only needs to be added to the interpolated angle ( phi 1) in order to obtain the corrected angle  phi .

Method for determining the position of an 
object with the aid of a sensor system, which generates 

a positional angle signal (ϕ₁) from two sinusoidal 
sensor signals which are electrically offset relative 

to each other by an angle of approximately 90°, wherein 
a co
rrection angle signal (Δ
ϕ
) is determined, which 
signal is added additively to the positional angle 

signal (ϕ₁), and wherein the signal produced in such a 
way is fed, as a corrected positional angle signal (ϕ), 

to further processing devices, characterised in that 
given knowledge of a phase error angle (α) the 

correction angle signal (Δϕ) is determined in a 
converter (2, 3) according to the relationship
