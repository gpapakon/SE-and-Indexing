<ABSTRACT>
According to a process for carrying out civil engineering works in the area of the sole (4) of an existing waste dump, passable shafts (1, 2) designed as mutually spaced, cased large hole borings are sunk down to the waste dump sole (4). At the level of the waste dump sole (4) the shafts (1, 2) are interconnected by a passable tunnel (5), forming a continuous working room. A sufficiently large working room is thus simply created above the waste dump sole (4) for carrying out sanitation works.

A process for performing building works in the
bed area of a dump loaded with refuse and other waste by

sinking at least one man-sized, lined shaft extending to
the dump bed (4), 
characterized in that
 several man-sized
shafts (1, 2) are sunk a certain distance apart as cased

large-diameter boreholes through the dump body (3) of the
dump as far as the dump bed (4), that the sinking of the

shafts (1, 2) is performed mechanically up to the
vicinity of the dump bed (4) and manually in the area

directly above the dump bed (4), and that the shafts (1,
2) are joined together at the level of the dump bed (4)

by a man-sized tunnel (5) to form a continuous work space
whose walls are supported by means of inserted support

elements (6).
The process according to claim 1, 
characterized
in that
 the work space at the level of the dump bed (4)
is ventilated through the shafts (1, 2).
The process according to any one of the claims
1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 upon completion of the
building works in the work space formed by two shafts (1,

2) and a tunnel section (5), the casing of the first
shaft is withdrawn and a third cased shaft is sunk on the

other side of the second shaft and is connected to the
second shaft by a man-sized tunnel.
