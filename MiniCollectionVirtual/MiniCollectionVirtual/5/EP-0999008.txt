<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for laser
drilling an airfoil which includes disposing material in
passages of the airfoil for blocking a laser beam from
striking the interior once the cooling air hole is
drilled through the wall of the airfoil. More
particularly, this invention relates to a method for
disposing material in passages in the airfoil, such as a
leading edge passage through an adjacent passage which
is in flow communication with the leading edge passage.Airfoils for gas turbine engines are disposed in a
flowpath for working medium gases. Examples of such
airfoils are turbine blades and turbine vanes. The
airfoils are bathed in hot gases as the gases are flowed
through the engine. Cooling air is flowed though
passages on the interior of the airfoil under operative
conditions to keep the temperature of the airfoil, such
as a turbine, vane or turbine blade, within acceptable
limits.In addition, the airfoil may have cooling air holes
extending from the interior to the exterior of the
airfoil. The cooling air holes duct cooling air from
passages on the interior of the airfoil through the hot
walls to the exterior. The exhausted cooling air
provides transpiration cooling as the air passes through
the wall and film cooling with a film of cooling air on
the exterior as the air is discharged from the airfoil.
The film of cooling air provides a barrier between the
airfoil and the hot, working medium gasses.The cooling air holes are small and may have
diameters that are in a range of 0.3 to 0.5 millimeters
(0.011 - 0.017 inches). The holes are drilled in predetermined
patterns and are contoured to insure adequate
cooling of the airfoil.One way to drill the holes uses a laser to direct a 
beam of coherent energy at the exterior of the airfoil.
The intense radiation from the laser beam burns through
the wall of the airfoil, leaving behind a hole which
provides a satisfactory conduit for cooling air. As the
laser beam penetrates through the airfoil wall into an
interior cavity, the laser beam may strike adjacent
structure on the other side of the cavity causing
unacceptable damage to the airfoil. Accordingly,
blocking material may be disposed in the cavity to block
the laser beam from striking walls bounding the cavity
after the beam penetrates through the airfoil wall.One approach is to leave disposed within the
airfoil the ceramic casting core around which the blade
is poured during the manufacturing process. The ceramic
core provides a suitable blocking material. The ceramic
core is subsequently
