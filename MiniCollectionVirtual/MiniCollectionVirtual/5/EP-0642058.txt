<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the production of photopolymer blocks, which can be used for producing prints in flexography, typography or dry offset, of the type comprising:   - a step of polymerising regions by exposure to ultraviolet radiation, - a step of etching the unpolymerised regions by immersion and brushing in an etching bath contained in an etching vat, the said bath being loaded with dissolved or suspended particles during the etching step, - separation of the components in the etching bath with reinjection into the etching vat of the liquid obtained during the separation, characterised in that the separation consists of filtration with removal of particles during the filtration. The invention also relates to an etching device for implementing the process.

Method for the manufacture of flexible 
printing blocks which can be used for the production 

of printed matter by flexography, typography or dry 
offset printing, of the type including: 


a polymerisation step for polymerising areas 
by exposing them to ultraviolet rays, 
an engraving step for engraving the 
non-polymerised areas by immersion and brushing in an 

engraving bath contained in an engraving tank, said 
bath becoming charged with dissolved particles or 

particles in suspension during the engraving step, 
a separation of the constituents of the 
engraving bath with re-injection into the engraving 

tank of the liquid obtained during the separation, 
this separation comprising a filtration with the 

progressive elimination of the particles during the 
filtration, 
 
   characterised in that the elimination of the 

particles by replacement of the filter effecting the 
filtration is automatic. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in 
that, in addition to the liquid obtained by  

 
separation, a quantity of water is injected, which is 

intended to compensate for the evaporation. 
Engraving device for the manufacture of 
flexible printing blocks, which can be used for the 

production of printed matter by flexography, 
typography or dry offset printing, of the type 

including: 

an engraving tank containing a bath (2) and 
brushes (3), 
a separation device (4) for separating the 
constituents of the bath operating as a closed mouth 

with re-injection into the engraving tank of the 
liquid obtained after separation of the constituents 

of the bath, 
 
   the separation device (4) comprising a 

separating means (7) formed by a filter, said filter 
being replaceable during the engraving as it becomes 

progressively saturated, and the separation device (4) 
being formed principally by an overflow system (5) to 

evacuate the solution from the engraving tank by an 
outlet pipe (21) above a filtration means (4) of a 

reception tank (6), the liquid obtained after  
 

separation in said tank being re-injected into the 
engraving tank by means of a pump (14), characterised 

in that the separating means (7) is formed by a filter 
tape (8) which is fed from a supply roll (9) and can 

be unrolled so as to replace the saturated portion of 
the tape. 
Device according to the preceding claim, 
characterised in that the filter tape is unrolled 

automatically, actuated by a filter saturation 
detector. 
Device according to the preceding claim, 
characterised in that it comprises a storage tank 

(12), into which the saturated filter tape is 
evacuated. 
Device according to one of claims 3 to 5, 
characterised in that it also comprises a mixing 

device (15) for the bath, which mixing device is 
formed by an external pipe (19) and a circulation 

pump (17).  
 
Device according to one of claims 3 to 6, 
characterised in that the volume of liquid in the 

recovery tank (6) is greater than that in the 
engraving tank, so as to compensate for the 

evaporation.
