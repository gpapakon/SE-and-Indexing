low-resolution image information as priority image information 

in hierarchical encoding, another encoder for encoding non-priority 
image information other than the priority image 

information, a first code quantity controller for controlling 
a sum total of the generated code quantities of both the 

priority image information and the non-priority image 
information within a predetermined value and a code quantity 

limiter for limiting the generated code quantity of the 
priority image information within a predetermined ratio to the 

sum total code quantity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image encoding
apparatus for encoding signals efficiently in a small code
quantity, which is suitable for use in a recording,
transmitting or display unit required to process digital
signals, and more specifically to an image encoding apparatus
for encoding priority image information (reproduced by
priority) in distinction from other image information and a
recording medium used therewith. Here, the priority image
information is an image searched from a recording medium at
high speed or a low-resolution image obtained when image
information has been encoded hierarchically.When image information is encoded at a high efficiency,
there exists some image information (referred to as priority
image information, hereinafter) which is effective when
reproduced by priority. In this case, only the priority image
information is to be decoded and reproduced according to the
objects. Further, the image information (referred to as non-priority
image information, hereinafter) other than the
priority image information is insignificant even if decoded
and reproduced alone.For instance, in the case of the hierarchical encoding
of the existing television signals (e.g., NTSC (National
Television System Committee Color Television)) and HDTV (high-definition
image television) signals, the difference
information between the existing TV signals and the HDTV
signals is encoded in addition to the existing TV signals, and
both the encoded information signals are decoded and further
added to reproduce the HDTV information signals. Here, when 
only the existing TV information signals are decoded, the
existing TV signals can be of course reproduced.In the above-mentioned case, the image information of the
existing TV signals is the priority image information, and the
difference information between both is the non-priority image
information.Further, when signals are reproduced from a recording
medium, a high speed search is often required by displaying
the image information on a display unit. In this case, when
the image information is encoded by predicting video signals
between pictures, the video signals are encoded independently
for each frame at intervals of several frames.Further, when the high-speed search is effected during
reproduction, only the image information encoded independently
is reproduced. In this case, the frame information encoded
independently is the priority image information, and the frame
information predicted between pictures is the non-priority
image information.As an

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for encoding image information provided as a sequence
of units of image information, comprising:


first encoding means (12) for encoding a priority portion of a unit of
image information, an image being reproducible from only the priority portion of

information;
second encoding means (5) for encoding a non-priority portion, other
than said priority portion, of said unit of image information;
target setting means (15) for setting a first target code quantity (TL) for
said encoding of said priority information portion. and for setting a second target

code quantity (TH) for said encoding of said non-priority portion based on
information relating to the code quantities outputted from said encoders for

previously encoded units of information and based on code quantity control data
applied to said first and second encoding means, respectively; and
target code quantity limiting means (16) for modifying said first and
second target code quantities (TL2, TH2); wherein
said first encoding means is controlled such that the generated priority
code quantity for said unit of information matches the modified first target code

quantity (TL2);
said second encoding means is controlled such that the generated non-priority
code quantity for said unit of information matches the modified second

target code quantity (TH2);
the encoding by said first and second encoders is controlled such that
the code quantity of said priority portion and the ratio thereof to said second code

quantity are variable between units of information;
the generated code quantities are controlled such that for a unit of
information, the sum of the generated code quantities for a respective priority

portion and a respective non-priority portion is smaller than a predetermined 
quantity;
said target code quantity limiting means (16) modifies said first and
second target code quantities for said unit of information such that the generated

code quantity of said priority portion is within a predetermined proportion of said
sum of generated code quantities, thus enabling complementing the priority code

quantity for a unit of information with non-priority code when the amount of
priority code is smaller than said predetermined proportion, while preventing the

priority code quantity from exceeding said predetermined proportion.

second encoding means and outputting the multiplexed codes.
An apparatus according to claim 4. and further comprising:

first control means (14) for controlling the first encoding means (12);
