<ABSTRACT>
In a character signal display for a camcorder, a character signal 
generator (70) generates character data by employing the synchronous signal 

separated from a video signal with which the synchronous signal is combined. 
The video signal is output from a camera portion (10) and the synchronous 

signal is separated from it by an electronic view finder (80) and the generated 
character data is output to a character combiner (20, 37, 40), to thereby 

eliminate the need for an extra synchronous signal generator (95) and 
synchronous signal separator (90). As a result, manufacturing cost is 

curtailed, whilst proper synchronous signals are provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a character signal display for a
camcorder.In general, a user can confirm the operational status of the equipment
currently being used by displaying characters onto such display devices as a
monitor or an electronic view finder, or select a function using the displayed
characters. A function that displays characters onto a screen of a display
device is called an "on screen display" (OSD). The OSD function is widely
applied to such devices as a television or camera-recorder (camcorder) for
displaying the image pictures.A vertical and a horizontal synchronous signal are employed so as to
display the character data for OSD onto an exact location of a screen. The
vertical and horizontal locations of the character data are determined by the
vertical and the horizontal synchronous signals.Figure 1 is a block diagram showing a conventional camcorder
character signal display which performs the conventional OSD function.Referring to Figure 1, a camera portion 10 is connected to a first
character combiner portion 20 which also is connected to a first input terminal
of a selector 31 of a recorder/reproducer 30. An external video signal input
terminal 3 is connected to a second input terminal of selector 31.
Recorder/reproducer 30 includes a selector 31, a recorder 32 connected to an
output terminal of selector 31, a reproducer 33, a first control switch 34
whose first select contact is connected to an output terminal of recorder 32 
and whose second select contact is connected to an input terminal of
reproducer 33 and whose output terminal is connected to a head 35, a second
control switch 36 whose first select contact is connected to an output terminal
of selector 31 and whose second select contact is connected to an output
terminal of reproducer 33, a second character combiner 37 connected to an
output terminal of second control switch 36, and a composite synchronous
signal separator 38 connected to an output terminal of second character
combiner 37. A third character combiner 40 is connected between second
character combiner 37 and an electronic view finder 80. A micro-computer
60 is connected to selector 31, select contacts of first and second control
switches 34 and 36 and to a data input terminal of a character signal generator
70. First to third output terminals of character signal generator 70 are
respectively connected to first to third character combiners 20, 37 and 40, and
also are connected to an output terminal of vertical and horizontal
synchronous signals of a

<CLAIMS>
A character signal display for a camcorder which selects either an input
camera video signal or an external video signal depending on a mode control

signal and utilizes a synchronous signal already present and combined with the
selected signal for character display, further comprising:


a camera portion (10) for converting the optical information of the
photographed object into an electrical video signal and forming a composite

video signal by combining said video signal with a composite synchronous
signal comprising respective horizontal and vertical synchronous signals

generated by a synchronous signal generator of the camera portion (10); the
character signal display characterised in comprising:
a view finder (80) for, in a first case, displaying a character signal by
generating respective horizontal and vertical synchronous signals and for

supplying the synchronous signals to character signal generating means (70),
the view finder (80) in a second, alternative, case being for displaying a

character signal by employing the vertical synchronous signal separated by a
synchronous signal separator (38) from the external video signal or the

composite video signal output via said camera portion (10), and employing the
horizontal synchronous signal separated by the view finder (80) from the

composite video signal and employing a horizontal synchronous signal
generated by the view finder (80);
external input determining means (50) for sensing whether an external
video signal including a composite synchronous signal comprising respective 

horizontal and/or vertical synchronous signals is input from an external input
terminal (3);
selection means (31) for selecting said camera video signal from the
camera portion (10) or an external video signal from the external input

terminal (3) depending on a mode control signal, and for selecting said camera
video signal if an external video signal is not input;
a micro computer (60) for, in the second case, receiving the video
signal selected by the selection means (31) from a synchronous signal

separator (38), which separates the vertical synchronous signal from the
received composite synchronous signal, and, in the first and second cases, the

microcomputer (60) being for outputting a selection control signal for
selecting said camera video signal or an external video signal depending on

a mode control signal to said selection means (31);
character signal generating means (70) for generating the character
signal for supply to a predetermined location, based on the vertical and

horizontal synchronous signals supplied from said micro-computer (60) and/or
said view-finder (80); and

character signal generated by said character signal generating means (70) with

said camera video signal or an external video signal.
A character signal display according to Claim 1, wherein said view
finder (80) comprises an AFC circuit (87) so that the horizontal synchronous 

signal separated from the signal loaded onto the video signal output via said
camera portion (10) can be corrected.
A character signal display according to any of Claims 1 or 2 wherein

said character signal combining means (20, 37, 40) comprises:

first character combining means (20) for combining record data
generated by said character signal generating means (70) and the camera video
