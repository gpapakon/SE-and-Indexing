<ABSTRACT>
A chuck (10) for releasably holding a tool such as 
a drill bit has a torque limiting coupling (60) in the 

mechanism which is rotated manually to close the jaws (30) 
of the chuck on the tool. When the chuck has been 

tightened on the tool by a certain amount, the torque 
limiting coupling (60) releases. Thereafter, continued 

manual rotation of the component which provides the 
input to the coupling operates a cam (80) and cam follower (70) 

mechanism which forces the jaws (30) of the chuck into even 
tighter engagement with the tool. When the chuck is 

subsequently loosened to release the tool, the cam (80) and 
cam follower (70) mechanism automatically reset to ready the 

chuck for reuse.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to chucks for
releasably holding tools (e.g., drill bits), and more
particularly to such chucks which can be easily and
simply operated to very securely hold a tool without
the need for a key to tighten the chuck on the tool.Chucks with keys for imparting final
tightening torque to the chuck to securely hold a tool
are well known. While such chucks have been highly
successful, they may have certain disadvantages. For
example, the key must be removed from the chuck before
the chuck is rotated at high speed (e.g., in a drilling
operation). Failure to remove the key may unbalance
the chuck when rotated at high speed, or cause the key
to be thrown out from the chuck in a radial direction
in a possibly unsafe manner. Although the key must
thus be frequently removed from the chuck, the key must
somehow be kept with the chuck or it may become lost.Because of these disadvantages of keyed
chucks, there has been increasing interest in recent
years in chucks which can be operated by hand without
the need for keys (see, for example, Huff et al. U.S.
patent 5,125,673 and Jordan et al. U.S. patent
5,215,317 on which is based the preamble of claim 1). Some of these keyless chucks have been 
highly successful, but there is always room for further
improvement.To be acceptable a chuck must be able to hold
a tool very securely. Chuck jaws with relatively fine
threads serve this objective because fine threads give
increased mechanical advantage. However, fine threads
make a chuck relatively slow to operate, thereby making
the chuck objectionable or even unacceptable to some
users. A chuck should also be as simple and easy to
operate as possible. For example, it is preferable for
the operator to be able to use a single, simple type of
motion to tighten or loosen the chuck. The chuck
should also reset reliably and automatically after each
use so that no additional resetting operation is
required from the operator.In view of the foregoing, it is an object of
this invention to provide improved chucks.It is another object of this invention to
provide manually operable, keyless chucks which do not
require especially fine jaw threads to hold a tool very
securely, indeed more securely than conventional
keyless chucks with fine threads.It is still another object of this invention
to provide manually operable, keyless chucks which
require the operator to perform only a single,
straightforward motion to tighten or loosen the chuck,
and which automatically reset after each use in a
highly reliable manner.These

<CLAIMS>
A chuck (10) for releasably gripping a
tool and comprising:


a main body (20);
a plurality of longitudinal tool-gripping
jaws (30) mounted for movement relative to

said main body (20), each of said jaws (30) being
movable relative to said main body parallel to the

longitudinal axis of that jaw, the longitudinal axes
of said jaws (30) being synclinal in the distal

direction along said body (20);
a nut (40) rotatably mounted on said
body (20), said nut (40) being also mounted for limited

axial motion relative to said body parallel to said
distal direction, said nut (40) being threadedly

engaged with each of said jaws (30) for causing said
jaws to move parallel to their longitudinal axes

when said nut (40) is rotated relative to said body (20)
or when said nut (40) is moved axially relative to

said body (20) parallel to said distal direction;
a sleeve (50) rotatably mounted on said
body (20);
a plurality of rolling cam follower
elements (70) disposed between a substantially

proximal-facing first surface of said nut (40) and a
substantially distal-facing second surface that

rotates relative to said body (20) with said sleeve
(50), said cam follower elements (70) being axially

compressed between said first and second surfaces
only after said jaws (30) have begun to grip a tool

and said nut (40) moves relative to said body (20) in
the proximal direction in reaction to the tool-gripping

force applied to the tool by said jaws (20);
and
means (130) for resiliently urging each
of said cam follower elements (70) to automatically 

return to its initial position relative to at least
one of said first and second surfaces when said cam

follower elements (70) are not compressed between said
first and second surfaces;

characterised in that a torque limiting coupling (60)
is provided, and operatively connected between said

sleeve (50) and said nut (40) for causing said nut (40) to
rotate relative to said body (20) with said sleeve (50)

in a jaw-tightening direction until said jaws (30)
have begun to grip the tool and more than a

predetermined threshold torque must be applied to
said sleeve (50) to continue to rotate said nut (40) in

said jaw-tightening direction, after which said
torque limiting coupling (60) releases so that said

sleeve (50) can continue to rotate in said jaw-tightening
direction with at least substantially

reduced transmission of torque from said sleeve (50)
to said nut (40) and therefore without further

rotation of said nut (40) in said jaw-tightening
direction;
each of said cam follower elements (70)
rolling, from initial positions relative to said

first and second surfaces, along an arcuate segment
of each of said first and second surfaces when said

cam follower elements (70) are compressed between said
first and second surfaces and after said torque

limiting coupling has released and said sleeve (50)
continues to rotate in said jaw-tightening direction

relative to said nut (40), at least one of said
segments along which each of said cam follower

elements (70) rolls being inclined toward the other of
the segments along which that cam follower element

rolls in the direction in which that cam follower
element rolls so that said cam follower elements (70)

force said nut (40) to move in said distal direction
relative to said body (20), thereby further tightening 

said jaws 30 on the tool.
The apparatus defined in claim 1
wherein said cam follower elements (70) are connected

to one another by an annular cage ring (72) which is
disposed circumferentially around said body (20) and

which is rotatable relative to said body (20) and
relative to said first and second surfaces, and

wherein said means for resiliently urging comprises
a spring (130) which acts in the circumferential

direction between said cage ring (72) and at least one
of said first and second surfaces.
The apparatus defined in claim 1 or
claim 2 wherein said torque limiting coupling (60)

comprises a releasable detent coupling (54,64) between
said sleeve (50) and said nut (40), said releasable

detent coupling transmitting torque from said sleeve
(50) to said nut (40) when said sleeve (50) is rotated in

said jaw-tightening direction until said torque
reaches said threshold torque, after which said

releasable detent coupling (54,64) releases and
transmits substantially no torque from said sleeve

(50) to said nut (40) during continued rotation of said
sleeve (50) in said jaw-tightening direction.
The apparatus defined in any
preceding claim wherein each of said cam follower

elements (70) is a ball.
The apparatus defined in claim 4
wherein said at least one of said segments along

which each of said elements rolls is a channel (84)
having a convex cross section for receiving a

portion of the surface of a ball. 
The apparatus defined in claim 5
wherein each of said channels (84) becomes

progressively shallower in the direction in which
the ball in said channel rolls.
The apparatus defined in any
preceding claim further comprising:


stop means (54b, 64b) operatively
coupled between said sleeve (50) and said nut (40) for

preventing said sleeve (50) from rotating by more than
a predetermined amount relative to said nut (40) in a

direction opposite to said jaw-tightening direction.
The apparatus defined in any
preceding claim wherein each of said segments along

which said cam follower elements (70) roll is an arc
substantially concentric with an axis about which

said nut (40) concentrically rotates.
