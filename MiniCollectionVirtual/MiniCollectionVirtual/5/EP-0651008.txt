<ABSTRACT>
A heat-curing organopolysiloxane composition whose 
curing characteristics do not change during storage and 

whose appearance is not impaired even upon exposure to high 
temperatures. The composition comprising: 

(A) 100 weight parts organopolysiloxane that contains at 
least 2 silicon-bonded alkenyl groups in each molecule, 

(B) organohydrogenpolysiloxane that contains at least 2 
silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms in each molecule, in a 

quantity that gives values in the range of 0.5/1 to 10/1 for 
the ratio of the number of moles of silicon-bonded hydrogen 

in the present component to the number of moles of 
silicon-bonded alkenyl in component (A), and 

(C) 0.005 to 100 weight parts microparticulate 
hydrosilylation catalyst that is composed of a platinum 

hydrosilylation catalyst and a thermoplastic resin 
composition wherein said thermoplastic resin composition 

consists of 30 to 90 weight% thermoplastic silicone resin 
and 70 to 10 weight% thermoplastic acrylic resin, with the 

provisos that the glass-transition point of the 
thermoplastic resin composition is 40°C to 200°C and the 

microparticulate hydrosilylation catalyst has an average 
particle diameter of 0.1 to 20 micrometers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a heat-curing
organopolysiloxane composition that cures through the
hydrosilylation reaction which is highly storage-stable
and also exhibits an excellent high-temperature
compatibility.There have been numerous attempts at
improving the storage stability and curing
characteristics of hydrosilylation-curing
organopolysiloxane compositions. One approach
suggested improvements to the hydrosilylation catalyst.
For example, JP-A 58-37053 (37,053/1983) teaches a
heat-curing organopolysiloxane composition whose
catalyst is a platinum catalyst-containing
thermoplastic silicone resin micropowder. A drawback
is that its curing characteristics change during
long-term storage, and its cure start-time (hereinafter
defined as the time required for the torque to reach
10% of its final value) declines during long-term
storage. JP-A 64-45468 (45,468/1989) and JP-A 3-68659
(68,659/1991) propose heat-curing organopolysiloxane
compositions in the form of a platinum catalyst
microcapsulated by thermoplastic organic resin.
Acrylic resins are ideal viewed from the criterion that
the organic resin should release the hydrosilylation
catalyst in the temperature range which is appropriate
for inducing the cure of heat-curing organopolysiloxane
compositions 80°C to 150°C. Unfortunately, these
compositions undergo discoloration when exposed to high
temperatures during or after curing.Our invention introduces a heat-curing
organopolysiloxane composition whose curing
characteristics do not change during storage and whose 
appearance is not impaired even upon exposure to high
temperatures.The invention provides to a heat-curing
organopolysiloxane composition comprising:
(A) 100 weight parts organopolysiloxane that contains
at least 2 silicon-bonded alkenyl groups in each
molecule,(B) organohydrogenpolysiloxane that contains at least
2 silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms in each molecule, in a
quantity that gives values in the range of 0.5/1 to
10/1 for the ratio of the number of moles of
silicon-bonded hydrogen in the present component to the
number of moles of silicon-bonded alkenyl in component
(A), and(C) 0.005 to 100 weight parts microparticulate
hydrosilylation catalyst that is composed of a platinum
hydrosilylation catalyst and a thermoplastic resin
composition, wherein said thermoplastic resin
composition consists of 30 to 90 weight% thermoplastic
silicone resin and 70 to 10 weight% thermoplastic
acrylic resin, with the provisos that the
glass-transition point of the thermoplastic resin
composition is 40°C to
