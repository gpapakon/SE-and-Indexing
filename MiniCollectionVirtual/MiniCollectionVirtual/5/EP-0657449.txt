<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to azole compounds which
are useful as an antifungal therapeutic agent and a method
of manufacturing the same as well as the use thereof.Various azole compounds exhibiting antifungal activity
have been reported (for example, EP0122056A1, EP0332387A1
and EP0122693A1).Furthermore, GB-A 2 159 148, EP-A 0 054 974, EP-A 0 321 131,
and Chem.Pharm.Bull. 39, 2581 (1991) are mentioned.However, these azole compounds are not satisfactory as
pharmaceutical agents in terms of antifungal activity, anti-fungal
spectrum, adverse reaction and the pharmacokinetics.There has been a demand for the compounds which exhibit
higher safety, better absorption in vivo and higher anti-fungal
activity as an antifungal therapeutic agent.The present invention relates to:
(1) a compound represented by the formula (I): 
, wherein Ar is the phenyl group which may have 1 to 3 substituents selected
from a group consisting of
a halogen,a halogenated lower (C1-4) alkyl group,a halogenated lower (C1-4) alkoxy group,a lower (C1-4) alkylsulfonyl group anda halogenated lower (C1-4) alkylsulfonyl group;R1 and R2are, the same or different, a hydrogen atom or
a lower (C1-4) alkyl group, orR1 and R2may combine together to form
a lower (C2-4) alkylene group;R3is a hydrogen atom or
formyl,
a (C2-7) alkanoylan arylcarbonyl having 7 to 15 carbon atoms,an alkoxycarbonyl having 2 to 7 carbon atoms,an aryloxycarbonyl having 7 to 15 carbon atoms oraralkylcarbonyl having 8 to 20 carbon atoms;Yis a nitrogen atom or a methine group; andR4is a phenyl group which may be substituted by hydroxyl group, carboxyl
group, alkoxycarbonyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, nitro
group, amino group, (C1-10)alkanoyl amino group, mono-(C1-10)alkyl
amino group, di-(C1-10)alkyl amino group, pyrrolidinyl, morpholino,
piperidino, pyrazolidinyl, perhydroazepinyl, piperazinyl, 4-benzylpiperazinyl,
4-acetylpiperazinyl, 4-(4-trifluoromethoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl,
4-[4-(1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethoxy)phenyl]-1-piperazinyl,
4-[4-(2,2,3,3-tetrafluoropropoxy)phenyl]-1-piperazinyl, 4-[4-(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)phenyl]-1-piperazinyl,
