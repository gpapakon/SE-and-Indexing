<ABSTRACT>
A combination stopper and shield closure (1) 
for sealing the open end of an evacuated 

body fluid collection tube. The stopper (20) 
is headless and includes a well in its top surface with 

an undercut at its base. The shield (10) 
includes a plurality of flexible fingers (15) extending from its 

top surface, each finger including a cleat (16) 
at its proximal end for engaging with the undercut (24) in 

the stopper. The interaction between the cleats and the undercut serve 
to securely hold the 

stopper within the shield and eliminate compression forces being 
applied to the stopper by the 

shield. In addition, the base of the well is convex to direct any 
residue body fluid away from 

the center of the well towards the undercut and minimize residue 
build-up, and the bottom 

portion of the stopper is concave to reduce the thickness of the 
stopper's diaphragm and reduce penetration force.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a combination stopper and shield closure for
body fluid collection tubes and, more particularly, relates to a closure for an evacuated
body fluid collection tube having a headless stopper that minimizes needle penetration
force by reducing radial compression interference in the stopper.An evacuated body fluid collection tube is commonly used by a doctor,
phlebotomist or nurse to draw a sample of body fluid from a patient in a hospital or
doctor's office for diagnostic testing. During the use of such a tube, a double-ended
needle in a needle holder is inserted in a vein of the patient and the evacuated tube is
inserted into the open end of the holder until the needle in the holder pierces the tube's 
closure. The vacuum in the tube then draws a body fluid sample from the patient into the
tube. When draw is completed the tube is removed from the holder and replaced by
additional tubes or the holder and tube are removed from the patient's vein. When the
body fluid sample in the tube is to be tested, the test sample can either be removed from
the tube by removing the closure from the open end of the tube or using a syringe to
pierce the closure and draw the test sample from the tube. These alternative methods of
removing the test sample from the tube, however, present divergent problems. If the
closure is removed from the open end of the tube, it is important that the stopper remain
attached to the shield. To avoid this problem it is common to increase the compression
forces on the stopper to firmly hold the stopper in the shield. However, if a syringe is
used to remove the test sample by piercing the closure it is imperative that the
compression forces on the stopper be minimized, since compression of the stopper
increases the force needed to pierce the stopper.Moreover, when using either method it is important for the closure to fit
securely on the open end of the tube and maintain the vacuum in the tube before,
during and after the collection procedure. The vacuum in the tube must be sufficient to
draw body fluid into the tube, since body fluid must be drawn as quickly as possible to
minimize the amount of time a patient has one end of the needle in their body, which
can be uncomfortable and cause pain. For example, if the vacuum in the tube is
deficient, subsequent removal of the tube from the needle holder and insertion of
another tube in the needle holder would be necessary which prolongs the unpleasant
procedure.Current closures for evacuated body fluid collection

<CLAIMS>
A closure (1) for sealing an open end of a body fluid collection tube
comprising:


a shield (10) and
a headless stopper (20) for sealing a body fluid collection tube, said
headless stopper including a well (30) in a top surface

   characterized by said shield having a plurality of flexible fingers (15)
extending from a top surface into said shield each of said plurality of flexible

fingers including a cleat (16); and said well having an undercut (24) around its
base (25) that receives and mates with each cleat (16) on said

plurality of fingers to securely retain said stopper within said shield.
A closure according to Claim 1, wherein said base (25) of said well (30)
comprises a convex bottom surface that directs residue body fluid from said

convex surface towards said undercut (24) in said well.
A closure according to Claim 1, wherein said shield (10) further
comprises an outer skirt (12) having a plurality of protrusions (18) 
extending
from an interior surface of said outer skirt into said shield, wherein each of said

plurality of protrusions are positioned to mate with a collar or ring on an outer
wall of the tube to securely lock said closure onto the tube and retain a vacuum

within the tube.
A closure according to Claim 1, further comprising a gas-barrier member
bonded to said shield (43) to improve vacuum retention within the tube and

protect said well from contamination.
A closure according to Claim 1, wherein said stopper further comprises a
plug (22) having a plurality of sealing rings (23) that form a primary seal with 

an inside wall at the open end of the tube.
A closure according to Claim 5, wherein said plug (22) includes a
concave bottom surface to minimise the thickness of said stopper and minimise

needle penetration force.
A closure according to Claim 1, wherein said shield further comprises:

a plurality of spokes (31) extending radially from an opening in the top
surface of said shield to support each of said plurality of flexible fingers; and
a sealing ring (28) between said shield and said stopper around said
opening in the top surface of said shield to prevent body fluid from migrating

out of said opening.
A closure according to Claim 1, wherein said shield further comprises a
plurality of ribs on an outer surface of said shield to provide means for gripping

said closure when being removed from the tube.
