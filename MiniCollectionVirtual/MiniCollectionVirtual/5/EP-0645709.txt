<ABSTRACT>
A facility is provided for making a backup copy (in 30) of a memory 
(11-1,---11-J), e.g., a database, such that a particular segment, or slice, of the 

memory is copied during one of a number of backup sessions. Accordingly, a full 
backup of the memory is completed during a last one of the backup sessions, in 

which the sessions are separated in time from one another by a predetermined 
duration, e.g., one day.

<DESCRIPTION>
The Invention relates to computer memory backup arrangements.In computer systems, a copy, or backup, of the contents of memory associated with a
computer is periodically made and stored in a so-called backup memory. This is done
so that if the computer memory fails, for whatever reason, then the contents of that
memory may be restored using the copy stored in the backup memory and using
stored copies of computer files which changed since the
backup was made. The latter copies are commonly referred to as incremental changes.It can be appreciated that it takes an appreciable period of time to run (i.e., make) a
backup copy of the contents of a very large computer memory, and during that time
the associated computer system is typically not used for another
purpose, since such use would interfere with the making of the backup copy. As such,
a backup session is usually scheduled for a particular period of time sufficient to
complete the backup during which the associated computer system is unavailable to
users.US 5241 670 discloses a method and system for making a backup copy of a
designated dataset.The invention provides a method of making a backup copy in an archive memory of a
computer memory as defined in Claims 1-9.In the drawing:
FIG. 1 shows a broad block diagram of a computer archiving system in
which the principles of the invention may be practiced.FIG. 2 is an illustrative example of one way in which a memory may be
partitioned, in accordance with the principles of the invention, to make partial
backup copies of the memory; andFIGs. 3 and 4 illustrate in flow chart form the program which
implements the invention in the system of FIG. 1.Turning now to FIG. 1, archiving system 100 includes computer 110, hard disc unit
115 and backup (archive) memory 30. The software which drives system 100 is stored
in disc memory 115. Computer 110, which may be, for example, the
SPARCSTATION 2 commercially available from Sun Microsystems, Inc., operates in
a conventional manner to periodically poll individual ones of 
computers 10-1 through 10-N via data network 20. Data network 20 may be, for
example, the well-known Ethernet network. Computer 110 invokes such polling on
a scheduled basis (e.g., daily, etc.) and does so for the purpose of storing in
memory 30 the contents of the memory associated with the computer that is being
polled, e.g., computer 10-1. Such contents typically comprise a plurality of named
files composed of, for example, data and/or programs, and may be in the order of,
for example, forty

<CLAIMS>
A method of making a back up copy in an archive memory (30) of a
computer memory, characterized in that the said computer memory

includes a plurality of blocks, the said method comprising the steps of:

partitioning the computer memory into a plurality of segments;
making partial back up copies of the blocks in each of the segments within
respective spaced intervals; and
making incremental back up copies within each interval of changes in blocks
other than those for which a partial back up copy is made.
A method according to Claim 1, wherein the addresses of the blocks for
which incremental backup copies are made are in a predetermined address

range.
A method according to Claim 1 or 2, wherein each segment constitutes a
predetermined percentage of the said computer memory.
A method according to any preceding claim, wherein the steps of making
backup copies of within each interval for partial and incremental backups

together comprise the following steps in the following order:

incrementally backing up changes in blocks of segments preceding the
segment for which a partial backup copy is next programmed to be

made;
partially backing up the blocks of the segment next programmed for
backup; and
incrementally backing up changes in blocks of segments following the
segment for which a partial backup copy has last been made.
A method according to Claim 1, wherein the steps of making backup
copies are made in the following order within each interval for partial and

incremental backups, including the steps of:

partially backing up the blocks of a segment next programmed for such
backup;
incrementally backing up changes in blocks of segments preceding the
segment for which a partial backup copy has last been made; and 
incrementally backing up changes in blocks of segments following the
segment for which a partial backup copy has last been made.
A method according to any preceding claim, wherein said computer
memory is completely backed up after a series of partial backups of

segments constituting the entire computer memory, wherein the amount of
computer memory contained in each segment may differ from series-to-series

for respectively backing up the entire memory.
A method according to Claim 1, wherein the said spaced intervals occur in a
sequence.
A method according to Claim 7, wherein the steps of making the backup
copies within each interval together comprise the following steps performed

in the following order:

first, making an incremental backup copy of changes that have occurred
since the last interval, in blocks in the segments having a preceding

address in the sequence relative to a given segment;
second, making a partial backup copy of the blocks of the given segment;
and
third, making an incremental backup copy of changes in blocks in the
segments having a succeeding address in the sequence relative to the

given segment.
A method according to Claim 7, wherein the steps of making backup copies
within each interval together comprise the following steps performed in the

following order:

making a partial backup copy of a given segment;
making an incremental backup copy of changes that have occurred since
the last interval, in blocks in segments having a preceding address in the

sequence than the given segments; and
making an incremental backup copy of changes since the last interval in
blocks in segments having succeeding addresses in the sequence than the

given segment.
