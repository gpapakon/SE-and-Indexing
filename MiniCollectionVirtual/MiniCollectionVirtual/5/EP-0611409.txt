<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns locks particularly although not 
exclusively door locks for hotel rooms. Door locks for hotel rooms have to serve a number of 
requirements. In the first place they must secure the room against 
unauthorised access. Secondly they need to provide the occupant with the 
facility of bolting the door from within yet provide the 
occupant with the ability to open the door from inside 
quickly and easily without the need for a key to enable 
any occupants of the room to leave quickly in an 
emergency. Thirdly each lock must be unique at least within each 
hotel, so that a room key for one room cannot be used to 
open another room door. On the other hand all locks 
should be capable of being opened by a single master key 
for use by cleaning staff or hotel management personnel. In recent years conventional locks have been replaced or 
modified with card releasable locks enabling the hotel to  
 
issue each guest with a card instead of a key and additional 
facilities can be provided with such locking systems such as 
terminating the door opening capability of a card after a 
particular time period has elapsed from the issue of the card 
to the guest. Problems have been experienced in practice with such systems 
and it is an object of the present invention to provide an 
improved card released lock and card operated locking system 
for hotels. Although the invention will be described exclusively in 
relation to hotels, it is to be understood that the invention 
is equally applicable albeit with minor modifications to office 
blocks, factories, government buildings, prisons, secure 
hospitals, schools and the like, indeed any building to which 
people have access and which contain well defined areas which 
are to be made secure against unauthorised entry. GB-A-2 227 052, US-A-4 534 194 and US-A-4 125 008 all show card 
releasable locking mechanisms which utilise solenoids to enable 
the doors to be unlocked. A disadvantage of such a mechanism 
is that the field produced by the solenoid coils can be 
mimicked by an external source, which therefore could be used 
by an unauthorised person to unlock the mechanism. The above-mentioned problems are solved by the present invention with a card releasable mechanism according to Claim 1.  
 Preferred embodiments and additional features are defined in the dependent claims.  
 The invention will now be described by way of example with 
reference to the accompanying drawings in which:- Figure 1 is a perspective view of part of a door on which

<CLAIMS>
A card releasable mechanism (14) for use in combination 
with a mortice lock (12) associated with a door (10) which lock 

(12) is openable by rotating a drive shaft (36) which extends 
therethrough, the mechanism comprising a second shaft (34) 

separate from but aligned axially with the lock drive shaft 
(36), which second shaft (34) protrudes through a front plate 

(50) on the outside of the door (10) to enable a handle (16) 
to be mounted thereon, rotation of which will if authorised 

release the lock (12) and allow the door (10) to be opened; 
clutch means (40) which, when engaged, transmits drive between 

the said second shaft (34) and the drive shaft (36) but when 
disengaged prevents rotation of the second shaft (34) from 

being transmitted to the drive shaft (36); a card reader 
(176), adapted to derive information from coded data carried 

by a card (124) inserted therein; decoding logic circuit means 
(122) for generating control signals if data received by the 

card reader satisfies pre-programmed conditions; and a clutch 
actuator (98, 100, 106) for operating said clutch means (40) 

in response to appropriately generated control signals to 
enable t
he lock (12) to be unlocked and the door (10) opened 
after the insertion of an appropriate card (124) into the card 

reader (176); 
characterised in that
 the clutch actuator (40) 
comprises an electric motor (106) and a drive transmission 

member (80) which is moveable relative to the second shaft 
(34), the electric motor (106) being adapted to rotate a cam 

(98) between a first position and a second position, movement 
of the cam from the first to the second said position effecting 

movement of the drive transmission member (80) from a rest position in 
which the clutch means (40) is disengaged into a drive 

transmitting position in which said drive transmission member 
(80) engages the second shaft (34) so as to enable drive to be 

transmitted between the two shafts 
and in that
 the cam (98) is 
mechanically connected to the drive transmission member (80) via a lost  

 
motion connection (82, 96) which is adapted to accommodate 

sufficient relative motion between the cam (98) and the 
drive transmission member (80) to enable the cam (98) to be moved 

from said first to said second position even if the drive 
transmission member (80) is misaligned and thereby prevented 

from moving into its drive transmitting position. 
A mechanism as claimed in claim 1, wherein the clutch 
means (40) provides a positive drive between the two shafts so 

that when the clutch is engaged no slip can occur. 
A mechanism as claimed in claim 2, wherein spring means 
is provided to retract the drive transmission member (80) when 

the clutch actuat
 
or (98, 100, 106) is deactivated. 
A mechanism as claimed in claim 3, wherein the clutch 
actuator (106) is adapted to operate and move the drive 

transmission member (80) into the drive transmitting position 
in response to a short duration pulse of electrical energy from 

the circuit means (122) and mechanical means is included which 
maintains the drive transmission member (80) in the drive 

transmitting position until a second short duration pulse of 
electrical energy is applied to the clutch actuator (98, 100, 

106) to enable the member (80) to be retracted. 
A mechanism as claimed in claim 4, wherein the period of 
time between the generation of the first pulse and the second 

pulse is controllable. 
A mechanism as claimed in claim 5, wherein the circuit 
means is arranged to receive data regarding said control from 

a card (124) to be inserted into the card reader (176), whereby 
the door lock (12) can be left enabled so that the door can be 

opened, without the need to insert a card, for a period of 
time.  

 
A mechanism as claimed in any of claims 4 to 6 wherein 
switch means is provided which is arranged to be actuated only 

when the lock (12) has been fully retracted to permit the door 
to be opened, which switch means causes a said second pulse to 

be generated thereby to enable the drive transmission member 
(80) to revert to its rest position, and thus to disengage the 

clutch means (40) so that when the door (10) has been shut, the 
lock (12) is once again incapable of being operated from 

outside the room. 
A mechanism as claimed in claim 7, wherein timing means 
(160) is included which is operable to generate a second pulse 

a short period of time after the first pulse has been generated 
in the event that the said switch means has not been actuated. 
A mechanism as claimed in claim 8, wherein the said short 
period of time is chosen as being the period of time which will 

normally be required to turn the handle and open the door (10). 
A mechanism as claimed in claim 1, wherein the circuit 
means (122) for generating the electrical signals for operating 

the clutch actuator (98, 100, 106) is adapted not to produce 
the clutch actuating signals until after the card (124) has 

been removed from the card reader (174). 
A mechanism as claimed in any of claims 1 to 10, wherein 
the drive transmission member (80) is formed from non-magnetic 

material so that it is not possible for the latter to be moved 
under the influence of an external magnetic field. 
A mechanism as claimed in any of claims 1 to 11, wherein 
the cam (98) is rotatable through approximately 180Â° so as to 

push the transmission member, by camming action, into its drive 
transmitting position, and the transmission member comprises 

a pin (80) which, when in its drive transmitting position, 
engages a slot in the second shaft (34) so as to provide 

driving engagement between the shaft and the pin; and the cam  
 

is rotatable through a further angle of 180Â° so as to enable 
the clutch means (40) to be disengaged. 
A mechanism as claimed in claim 12, wherein spring means 
(94) acts on the pin (80) in a direction to maintain contact 

with the cam (98) and the lost motion connection (82, 96) is 
arranged to accommodate the whole of the axial movement of the 

cam (98) relative to the pin (80). 
A mechanism as claimed in any of the preceding claims, 
wherein the cam (98) is non-symmetrical and is so shaped that 

the part of the cam which is operable to produce the movement 
of the pin (80) into the drive transmitting position 

corresponds to an inclined plane which subtends a small angle 
and that part which enables the pin (80) to return to its rest 

position corresponds to a very steeply inclined plane which 
subtends an angle approaching 90Â° whereby the time required to 

move the pin (80) from the drive transmitting to the rest 
position is much less than that required to move the pin (80) 

into the drive transmitting position from the rest position. 
A mechanism as claimed in any of claims 12 to 14, wherein 
the electric motor (106) is connected to the cam via 

transmission means comprising a worm and spur gear (102, 104)

card reader (176) is programmed so as to distinguish between 
a plurality of different cards and following the insertion (and 

recordal) of one type of card is adapted to cause the green 
light emitting diode to flash at least on the inside of the 

door (10) but to inhibit at that time the generation of a 
signal for engaging the clutch, and the card reader is 

programmed to generate a clutch engaging signal after the same 
card has been inserted and removed a second time. 
A mechanism as claimed in any of claims 16 to 19, wherein 
the circuit means is operable to activate a buzzer or other 

warning device when generating said further control signals so 
an occupant of a room to which the door is fitted can be 

alerted to the fact that somebody wishes to gain entry.
