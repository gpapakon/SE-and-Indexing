<ABSTRACT>
An external preparation for skin comprising at least one of the 
glycosides of hydroxysalicylic acid and/or the glycosides of aliphatic 

esters of hydroxysalicylic acid represented by the following general 
formula 1; 


wherein R₁ represents one selected from the group consisting of a 
saturated hydrocarbon group and an unsaturated hydrocarbon group which 

have 1 to 20 carbon atoms and which may be of either a straight-chain or 
a branched-chain, one of R₂ and R₃ represents a sugar residue and the 

other hydrogen. 
The external preparation for skin has an excellent whitening 
effect and/or an excellent skin care effect.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an external preparation for 
skin and, more particularly, to an external preparation for skin having 
an excellent whitening effect. The mechanism of a chloasma is partially known but it is 
generally considered that a melanin pigment is produced under 
abnormality of hormone stimulus of ultraviolet rays from the sun and 
abnormally settles in skin. Examples of remedy for such a chloasma or 
a birthmark are, a method of orally administration of a large amount of 
a substance which suppresses the generation of melanin such as vitamin 
C, a method of injecting glutathione or the like, and a method of 
applying kojic acid, vitamin C, cystein or the like to the topical part 
in the form of ointment, cream, lotion or the like. In Europe and 
U.S.A., a hydroquinone composition is used. However, since these compounds except for the hydroquinone 
composition manifest the effect very slowly, they do not produce an 
adequate whitening effect. On the other hand, although the effect of 
hydroquinone is recognized for the present, since it has a sensitization 
property, use thereof is generally limited. In order to improve the safety of hydroquinone, an attempt has  
 
recently been made at forming hydroquinone into an alkyl monoether of 
higher alcohols, but no product which is sufficiently safe has been 
produced. It was also attempted to use a glucoside of hydroquinone 
as a whitening agent, as illustrated by FR-A-2 577 805. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to 
eliminate the above-described problems in the related art and to provide 
a safe whitening agent having excellent whitening effect, and an 
external preparation for skin containing such a whitening agent. As a result of studies undertaken by the present inventors so as 
to achieve this aim, it has been found that a specific glycoside among 
the glycosides of hydroxysalicylic acid and the glycosides of aliphatic 
esters of hydroxysalicylic acid has a stronger whitening effect than 
hydroquinone, and that it is possible to produce a safe external 
preparation for skin having excellent whitening effect from such a 
specific glycoside. The present invention provides an external preparation for skin 
comprising at least one of the glycosides of hydroxysalicylic acid 
and/or the glycosides of aliphatic esters of hydroxysalicylic acid 
represented by the formula 1: 
  
 
wherein R1 represents one selected from the group consisting of a
