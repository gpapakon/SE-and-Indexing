<ABSTRACT>
A rigid disk drive device includes a rotatable 
disk disposed in a housing, the diameter of said disk 

being such in relation to the dimension of the housing 
that rotation of the disk produces turbulent air flow 

rather than laminar air flow between the disk and the 
housing, thereby producing less resistance between the 

disk and the housing.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to hard disk 
drive systems and relates more particularly to such 
systems having reduced power consumption and air 
turbulence. Disk drive storage devices designed for battery 
operated personal computers such as laptops and 
notebooks are required to operate on 5 or 3.3 volts and 
to consume the minimum amount of battery power for long 
lasting operation without repeated recharging of the 
battery. Many of the applications for these devices 
involve use in airplanes or other environments where 
battery recharging is not available. Consequently, 
long lasting battery power life is a requirement. This battery power life requirement is especially 
important on 3.5 inch and smaller form factor disk 
drive devices where the surface velocity of the 
rotating disk medium is relatively high. It has been 
customary in most small form factor hard disk drives to 
enclose the disk in a housing which is only slightly 
larger than the diameter of the disk itself, thereby 
reducing the packaging size and space requirements for 
the drive. For example, the 3.5 inch form factor hard  
 
disk drives employ a disk with a diameter of 95 
millimeters and a separation of .040 inches between the 
disk periphery and the inner walls of the disk housing. 
However, this very close spacing between the disk 
periphery and the housing walls results in a high 
laminar shear air resistance between the outer edge of 
the disk and the stationary wall. The resistance of air between a moving and a 
stationary object is determined by spacing and velocity 
parameters. For a constant velocity system, the only 
parameter that influences the degree of air resistance 
is the spacing between the stationary and moving 
elements. At small spacings, the air is sheared in a 
laminar manner and the shear resistance is relatively 
high. For larger spacings, the air moves into a 
turbulent mode and the air resistance is reduced; 
consequently, the power required to keep the moving 
element in motion is reduced. A general discussion of 
the airflow in rigid disk drives is contained in an 
article "Aerodynamic Aspects of Disk Files", IBM 
Journal of Research and Development, November 1974, 
pages 480-488. Another requirement associated with power 
consumption in hard disk drives is to reduce the moment 
of inertia of the rotating disks for fast speed-up of 
the device at power-up cycle. One characteristic of 
battery operated systems is that for power saving 
purposes the disk drive devices are frequently and 
automatic
