<DESCRIPTION>
 INDUCπON OF SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS IN TAXUS, ANDTHE PRODUCTION OF TAXANE-RING CONTAININGALKALOIDS THEREFROMFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe invention is in the field of plant cell culture and pharmacology. In particular, the invention relates to the induction of somatic embryogenesis in plant tissue cultures and primary explants of the genus Taxus, specifically T. brevifolia.The invention further relates to the surprising discovery that somatic embryos induced from explants of T. brevifolia produce taxane- ring containing alkaloids. Utilizing this observation, methods are described for the production of taxol and taxol precursors from in vitro propagated cultures of somatic embryos.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONA. Taxol and the production of secondary plant metabolites in vitro Taxol, a diterpene, was first identified in 1964 and has subsequently been shown to have anti-cancer activity against ovarian cancer, breast cancer, small-cell lung cancer, melanoma, and colon cancer. The structure of taxol and two taxane-riπg containing alkaloid precursors is as follows: 
TβrotereTaxol is produced primarily in the bark and cambial tissue of the pacific yew Taxus brevifolia. Using current purification procedures, 1 

kilogram of taxol requires processing of approximately 10,000 kilograms of bark. This is equivalent to 2,000-4,000 sixty to seventy year old trees. Recent estimates put the need of taxol at approximately 250 kilograms of the purified drug per year. This is equivalent to a yield of 25 million kilograms of dried bark or approximately 750,000 trees. Due to the shortage of the pacific yew, other sources of taxol are currently being soughtOne potential source of taxol which has been examined is in vitro cultured plant cells and tissues. U.S. Patent No. 5,019,504 describes the initiation and proliferation of callus cell cultures from explants of T. brevifolia. The callus cells produced by this procedure were shown to produce taxol.There are several obstacles to the use of callus or undifferentiated cell cultures as a means of producing secondary metabolites such as taxol. Typically, secondary metabolites are produced by specialized or differentiated tissues; most notably bark in the case of taxol, or leaves in the case of other taxanes such as baccatin. Undifferentiated, or callus cultures often lack the necessary biosynthetic capacity to assemble molecules as complex as taxanes, or, the degree of cytodifferentiation required to sequester these molecules once synthesized. The result has been that most secondary

WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. A method of producing embryogenic tissue containing somatic embiyos from explants from the genus Taxus comprising the steps of: culturing a Taxus explant in a culture medium; and successively transferring the explant to fresh media during culture to obtain early stage somatic embiyos.
2. A method of clonally propagating plants from the genus Taxus comprising the steps of: culturing a Taxus explant in a culture medium; successively transferring the explant to fresh media during culture to obtain early stage embryos; and transferring said early stage embryos to a medium capable of inducing plantlet formation.
3. A method of producing taxane ring-containing alkaloid compounds from embiyogenic tissue cultures of Taxus comprising the steps of: culturing explants from the genus Taxus in a culture media under conditions which produce somatic embiyos, or somatic seedlings; and isolating said taxane ring-containing alkaloid compounds from said embryos or said media.
4. A method of producing genetically altered plants of the genus Taxus comprising the steps of: culturing explants from the genus Taxus in a culture media under condition which produce somatic embryos; 


 introducing DNA into said embryos to produce genetically altered embiyos; and regenerating plants from said altered embryos.
5. A method of producing genetically altered plants of the genus Taxus comprising the steps of: obtain explants from the genus Taxus; introducing DNA into said explant; culturing said explant containing said DNA in a culture media under conditions which produce somatic embryos; and regenerating plants from said somatic embiyos.
6. The method of any of claims 1-5 wherein said explant is derived from immature arils.
7. The method of any of claims 1-5 wherein said culturing is in the dark and said transferring occurs from about every 2-3 weeks.
8. The method of claims 4 or 5 wherein said DNA is introduced into said embryo by micro-injection.
9. The method of claims 4 or 5 wherein said DNA is introduced into said embryo by a Ti-plasmid or a modification thereof.
10. The method of claims 4 or 5 wherein said DNA is introduced into said embryo by electroporation.
11. The method of claims 4 or 5 wherein said DNA is introduced into said embryo by particle acceleration. 


 12. Cultured Taxus embiyogenic tissue.
13. The cultured embryogenic tissue of claim 12, wherein said tissue is derived from a plant selected from the group consisting of T. brevifolia, T. baccata, T. x media, and T. cuspidata.
14. A method of producing variants of plants from the genus Taxus which produce elevated levels of taxane-ring containing alkaloids comprising the steps of; culturing explants from the genus Taxus in a culture media under condition which produce somatic embiyos; inducing mutagenesis in said explants with a capable agent; selecting embryos which produces said elevated level of taxane-ring containing alkaloid; and regenerating plants from said selected embryos.
