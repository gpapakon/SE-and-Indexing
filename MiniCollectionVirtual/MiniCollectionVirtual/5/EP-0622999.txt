<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a machine for
scrubbing or finishing a floor surface and has
particular reference to such a machine of the kind
hereinafter referred to as "the kind described" which
comprises carriage means adapted for translational
movement over a floor surface, a work head and motor
means which is carried by the said carriage means and
is arranged in use to drive the said work head.The said work head may include a brush or pad carrier
which is provided with means for securing a brush or
pad thereto. The said motor means may include a
rotary output shaft which is adapted to carry the
said brush or pad carrier and to maintain it in
working contact with the said floor surface. The
said motor means may be carried on an upper surface
of the carriage such that the said rotary output
shaft extends downwardly through a hole formed in the 
carriage to carry the said pad carrier in coaxial
relation therewith at the lower end of the shaft.The carriage may be provided with an upstanding
handle at a rear end thereof, whereby, in use, an
operator moves the machine over a floor surface
whilst the motor means drives the said work head at a
high speed to scrub, polish or burnish the floor
surface. The carriage may also include a pair of
rear transit wheels which are mounted on an axle
towards the rear of the carriage. Once the scrubbing
or finishing operation is finished, the motor is
switched off and the machine can be rocked backwards
onto its rear transit wheels to lift the work head
away from the floor surface. The machine can then be
pushed by the operator on the said transit wheels to
another location where it is required or for
storage.It will be appreciated that the motor is generally
heavy, and lifting the motor and work head away from
the floor and transporting the machine in such a
position requires considerable physical effort.
Moreover, although the weight of the machine is 
supported on the work head whilst in use, it is
undesirable to store the machine in such a position
because the weight of the machine will tend to deform
the said brush or pad. In use, the motor drives the
work head at a high speed, and such deformation of
the brush or pad causes the machine to run out of
balance frequently resulting in an unacceptable
amount of vibration. In the machines, currently
available in the marketplace it is desirable to
remove the pad from the pad carrier after using the
machine and to re-fit the brush when the machine is
next required.In order to remove the pad, however, the machine must
be

<CLAIMS>
A machine for scrubbing or finishing a floor surface
comprising a carriage (12), workhead means (100),

workhead pivot means (117), for causing or allowing
said workhead (100) to be movable with respect to the

carriage between a first working position and a second
rest position, and a rocking means for rocking said

carriage (12) with respect to said surface;

characterised in that a bias means (130) is provided
for acting on said workhead (100) in one of said

positions for moving the workhead (100) from said one
position to the other position, the arrangement being

such that rocking said carriage (12) on its rocking
means causes or allows the workhead (100) to move under

the influence of said bias means from said one position
to said other position.
A machine as claimed in claim 1 characterised in that
said bias means comprises a spring adapted to act

between the workhead and the carriage. 
A machine as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2
characterised in that the workhead includes a

brush housing comprising an annular upper wall and a
cylindrical skirt which depends from a periphery of

said annular wall, the brush or pad holder being 
arranged for rotation substantially coaxially within

the housing.
A machine as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims characterised in that the motor means and the

brush housing together with the workhead are movable
with the workhead as the latter moves between said

first and second positions.
A machine as claimed in claim 4 characterised in
that the weight of the workhead, brush motor and

housing assembly is distributed assymmetrically of the
pivot means when the workhead is in said one position,

to provide said bias means, the arrangement being such
that rocking the carriage on its rocking means allows

the workhead assembly to move from said one position
to the other under the influence of gravity.
A machine as claimed in claim 3
characterised in that the workhead assembly is

oriented so the upper surface of the brush housing is
generally horizontal with the workhead in working

contact with the floor surface. 
A machine as claimed in any preceding claim
characterised in that the workhead assembly includes

means for supporting the assembly in the rest position
which support means comprises one or more castors or

rollers arranged to contact the floor surface when
said workhead is in the rest position.
A machine as claimed in claims 3 or 6
characterised in that the upper surface of the brush

housing is provided with means for pivoting the
workhead assembly relative to the carriage means,

said pivot means including two spaced upstanding
brackets secured to said upper surface towards the

periphery thereof, the brackets being arranged
diametrically opposed one another so that a through

bore in each bracket together define said pivot
axis.
A machine as claimed in claim 8 characterised in
that the carriage means comprises two spaced chassis

members each carrying pivot means for the workhead
assembly and further characterised in that said pivot

brackets on the brush housing are attached one to each
arm on the horizontal axis generally transverse the 

fore-aft direction of the carriage such that the
workhead assembly can pivot between its work position

and its rest position in which latter position the
workhead is disposed forwardly of said carriage. 
A machine as claimed in any preceding claim
characterised in that said carriage has rear wheels

which constitute the rocking means and the carriage is
capable of being rocked forwards and backwards on said

rear wheels; a handle being used to effect rocking of
the carriage with respect to a floor surface.
A machine as claimed in any preceding claim
characterised in that rocking of the carriage on the

rocking means causes or allows the workhead assembly
to move under the influence of said bias means from

its work position to its rest position in which it is
supported on a roller means on the brush housing. 
A machine as claimed in claim 7
characterised in that the bias means acts to move the

workhead from said one position to said other position
further characterised in that the workhead assembly is

disposed over-centre with respect to the pivot axis 
and the point of contact between the roller means and

the floor surface whereby the reaction at the said
roller means exerts a moment of force about the said

axis which serves to maintain the workhead assembly in
said other position thereby permitting the machine to

be transported over a floor with its workhead out of
contact therewith.
A machine as claimed in claim 12 characterised
in the workhead is provided with a releasable locking

or retaining means to retain the workhead in its rest
position.
A machine as claimed in claim 10
characterised in that the workhead assembly comprises

a counterweight offset from the pivot axis whereby, in
its work position, the weight of the workhead is

distributed asymmetrically with respect to the pivot,
the arrangement being such that when the machine is

rocked backwards on its rear wheels, the counterweight
causes the workhead assembly to pivot about its axis

from its work position to its rest position.
