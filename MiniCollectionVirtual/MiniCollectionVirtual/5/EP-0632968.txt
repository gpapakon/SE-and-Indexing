Filter tow consisting of cellulose acetate 
filaments and/or fibres having an additive on their 

surface, characterized in that the additive consists of 
cellulolytic enzymes and at least the surface of the 

cellulose acetate filaments and of the cellulose acetate 
fibres consists of a cellulose acetate having an acetyl 

number of less than 53 %, preferably less than 49 %. 
Process for producing a filter tow according to 
Claim 1 by essentially 


spinning cellulose acetate filaments by pressing a 
solution of cellulose acetate having an acetyl number 

of at least 53 % in acetone through a spinneret having 
a plurality of orifices and then optionally cutting 

the cellulose acetate filaments into cellulose acetate 
fibres, 
collecting a multiplicity of the cellulose acetate 
filaments and/or fibres thus obtained to form a filter 

tow
 
and 
applying an additive to the surface of the cellulose 
acetate filaments and the cellulose acetate fibres,
 
characterized in that 
the cellulose acetate filaments and the cellulose 
acetate fibres are subjected to a hydrolysis treatment 

such that at least the surface cellulose acetate of 
these filaments and fibres has an acetyl number of 

less than 53 %, preferably less than 49 %, after the 
hydrolysis treatment,
 
and  

 
the additive applied is an additive composed of 
cellulolytic enzymes. 
Process according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the hydrolysis treatment is carried out with the aid 

of caustic soda or with the aid of gaseous ammonia after 
the spinning of the cellulose acetate filaments or after 

the cutting of the cellulose acetate filaments into 
fibres. 
Tobacco smoke filter element consisting of a 
section of a transverse-axially compacted filter tow 

composed of cellulose acetate filaments and/or cellulose 
acetate fibres and set with the aid of a plasticizer for 

cellulose acetate or with the aid of an adhesive, an 
additive being present on the surface of the cellulose 

acetate filaments and/or fibres, characterized in that 

the additive consists of cellulolytic enzymes and at 
least the surface of the cellulose acetate filaments and 

of the cellulose acetate fibres consists of a cellulose 
acetate having an acetyl number of less than 53 %, 

preferably less than 49 %. 
Process for producing a tobacco smoke filter 
element according to Claim 4 by providing a filter tow 

consisting of cellulose acetate filaments and/or fibres 
with a plasticizer for cellulose acetate or an adhesive, 

then transverse-axially compacting and optionally 
sheathing this filter tow with a sheathing strip, cutting 

the thus compacted and optionally sheathed filter tow 
into individual tobacco smoke filter rods and finally 

cutting these tobacco smoke filter rods into individual 
tobacco smoke filter elements, characterized in that 


the filter tow used is a filter tow as claimed in 
Claim 1,
 
or 
the filter tow used is a filter tow wherein the 
cellulose acetate of which the cellulose acetate 

filaments and the cellulose acetate fibres consist is 
soluble in acetone and has an acetyl number of at 

least 53 %, the cellulose acetate filaments and 
cellulose acetate fibres are subjected to a hydrolysis  

 
treatment such that at least the surface cellulose 

acetate of these filaments and fibres has an acetyl 
number of less than 53 %, preferably less than 49 %, 

after the hydrolysis treatment, and the additive 
applied to the surface of the cellulose acetate 

filaments and fibres is an additive composed of 
cellulolytic enzymes. 
Process according to Claim 5, characterized in 
that the hydrolysis treatment is carried out 


with the aid of caustic soda
 
or 
with the aid of gaseous ammonia.
