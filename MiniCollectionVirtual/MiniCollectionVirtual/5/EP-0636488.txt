<ABSTRACT>
A stencil discharger having a stripping means for 
removing a spent stencil paper (P) from the outer peripheral 

surface of a drum (1); a stencil holding section (9) for holding 
the spent stencil paper that has been removed from the 

outer peripheral surface of the drum (1); a transport means (4) 
for transporting the spent stencil paper that has been 

removed from the outer peripheral surface of the drum (1); a 
compression member (35) which is openable in the direction of 

transport of the spent stencil paper and provided on the 
transport route between the transport means and the 

stencil holding section, to check the transport of the 
spent stencil paper that has been transported by the 

transport means; and a push-out means (22) which opens the 
compression member to discharge the spent stencil paper 

into the stencil holding section by pushing out, from the 
transport means side, the spent stencil paper which has 

been compressed by the compression member.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a stencil discharger, for
attachment, for example to a mimeograph equipment or other, for
compressing and discharging spent stencil paper, and to a stencil
discharge box to be applied to the stencil discharger, for example.As a mimeograph, a rotary mimeograph equipment
having a cylindrical drum has been known. Such a
mimeograph equipment is generally provided with an ink
supply means inside of the drum. A mimeograph stencil
paper can be wrapped around the outer peripheral surface
of a circumferential wall which is pervious to ink.
Printing is done by transporting a printing paper
inserted between the drum and an impression roller as the
drum rotates.In the above-described conventional mimeograph
equipment, generally a stencil discharge means comprising
stripping pawls, a take-up roller, and a stencil
receiving box is provided in the vicinity of the drum.
That is, the spent stencil paper is released, with its
one end gripped by the stripping pawls, from the surface
of the rotating drum, and then is pushed for discharging
directly into the stencil discharge box.According to a conventional stencil paper discharge 
means, the stencil paper is pushed into the stencil
discharge box by the take-up roller which strips the
stencil paper from the drum. Therefore there exists such
a problem that the stencil paper in the stencil discharge
box is compressed insufficiently, and when the stencil
discharge box has become almost full of spent stencil
paper, the stencil paper once discharged into the box
floated back to cling around the take-up roller. GB-A-2,241,673 discloses a stencil discharge apparatus
which comprises means for peeling a stencil from the outer
circumferential surface of a rotary cylindrical drum, a
rotary unit rotatably located near the peeling means, the
rotary unit having a receiving portion opening backwardly
with respect to the rotating direction of the rotary unit,
and a stencil discharge box located near the rotary unit.
The stencil discharge box has an introducing plate which is
operable in response to the rotation of the rotary unit for
compressing the stencil within the receiving portion of the
rotary unit. That is, on further rotation of the rotary
unit the used stencil is compressed by the introducing
plate before leaving the receiving portion and subsequently
passing into the stencil discharge box. In view of the above-described various problems, it
is an object of the present invention to provide a
stencil discharger which has a larger-capacity stencil

<CLAIMS>
A stencil discharger, comprising: a stripping
means (3) for stripping a spent stencil paper from the

outer peripheral surface of a drum (1); a stencil discharge
box (17) for holding said spent stencil paper (P) that has

been stripped from said outer peripheral surface of said

drum (1); a transport means (4,7;4) for transporting to said
stencil discharge box (17) said spent stencil paper (P)

that has been stripped from said outer peripheral surface
of said drum (1) by said stripping means (3); a compression

member (19;30;35) openable in the direction of transport of said
spent stencil paper (P), located on a transport route

between said transport means (4,7;4), and said stencil
discharge box (17), to prevent transport of said spent

stencil paper (P) that has been transported by said
transport means (4,7;4), and then to compress said spent

stencil paper (P); and a movable push-out means (22) for
discharging said spent stencil paper (P) into said stencil

discharge box (17), which is arranged to move so as to open
said compression member (19;30;35) and push said spent stencil

paper (P) that has been compressed by said compression
member (19;30;35) out of said transport means (4,7;4) side into

said stencil discharge box (17). 
A stencil discharger as claimed in claim 1,
wherein said compression member is composed of an elastic

plate (30).
A stencil discharger as claimed in claim 1,
wherein said compression member is composed of a rigid

plate (35), which is constantly pressed towards said
transport means side.
A stencil discharger as claimed in any preceding
claim, in which the stencil discharge box (17) is removable,

the compression member (19) is located on a spent stencil
receiving port side of said stencil discharge box (17).
A stencil discharger as claimed in claim 1,
further comprising: an inclined guide section (15;40;50;80) for

guiding said spent stencil paper (P) from a receiving port
(18) of said stencil discharge box (17) in the push-out

direction of said push-out means (22).
