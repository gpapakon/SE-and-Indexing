<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to voltage regulators and 
more specifically to on-board voltage regulators for 
semiconductor devices. Electronic products, such as notebook computers, have 
become more portable in size due to advances in VLSI and 
semiconductor processing technology. With this trend, it has 
become quite desirable, if not entirely essential, to have 
components of those devices operating with less power 
consumption. Recently, the operating voltage for those 
on-board devices and components have been reduced from 5 volt 
to 3 volt, as technology has made low power applications 
possible and cost effective. However, the external 
environment, e.g. I/O and peripherals, of the components and 
chips still operate the interface at 5 volt level. 
Therefore, it has become desirable to maintain a 5 volt 
supply for interface with the external environment of a 
semiconductor device, while providing a 3 volt operating 
voltage to the core of the device. The semiconductor device 
would thus consume less power at the core without any impact 
on its external compatibility. Voltage regulators are well known in the art. However, 
the present invention is capable of providing reduced voltage 
supply to the "core" of a semiconductor device for reduced 
power consumption when integrated on-board with the 
semiconductor device. A semiconductor device with this 
capability will thus be able to remain compatible with its 
external components and environment.  Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to 
provide a reduced operating voltage to the core of a 
semiconductor device for low power applications. It is also an object of the present invention to 
provide a reduced operating voltage while maintaining a 5 volt 
level with the periphery of the device. It is further an object of the present invention to 
integrate the reduced operating voltage supply with the 
semiconductor device without substantial increase in the 
silicon usage. A voltage regulator for regulating the voltage supply 
to the core of a semiconductor device is disclosed. The 
voltage regulator comprises a reference voltage generator for 
generating a reference voltage based on the supply source, an 
operational amplifier for comparing the core voltage with the 
reference voltage, a series dropping PFET for maintaining the 
core voltage at the reference voltage level as its gate is 
operated by the output of the op-amp, and an external filter 
capacitor coupled to the core voltage node to supply transient 
current and hence
