<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a swing door (1) for a gateway, having a door leaf (6) which is arranged on a housing (34) and is mounted, with the aid of bearing elements (16, 16'), such that it can pivot about a vertical axis (33), the door leaf (6) being driven via an electric motor (22) which is connected to a drive shaft (26) which is intended for moving the door leaf (6) and which optionally has a coupling (24) provided upstream of it, and having a braking device (29) which is intended for arresting the door leaf (6) in the initial position and in the open position, the drive mechanism (32) which is formed in this manner and can be influenced by control means being configured essentially as a column-like structural unit and provision being made for a carrying device (19) which, together with the housing (34), is intended for carrying the drive mechanism (32) and the door leaf (6). The esssence of the invention consists in that the carrying device (19) of the swing door (1) exhibits at least one cylindrical casing portion (20) which is intended for receiving the bearing elements (16, 16') of the door leaf (6), the at least one casing portion (20), and thus the bearing elements (16, 16'), being arranged concentrically with respect to the swing axis (33) of the door leaf (6), and in that provision is made for a swing arm (27) which is connected in a rotationally fixed manner to the drive shaft (26) and in a rotationally fixed manner to the swing part (7) of the door leaf (6).

A swing gate for a gateway for persons, having a gate leaf (6) arranged on a housing (34) 
and pivotally mounted by means of bearing members (16, 16') about a vertical axis (33), 

the gate leaf (6) being driven via an electric motor (22) connected to a drive shaft (26) 
for moving the gate leaf, a coupling (24) optionally being connected upstream of the 

drive shaft (26), and having a brake device (29) to lock the gate leaf in the initial position 
and in the open position, the driving mechanism (22, 24, 26, 29) formed in this manner 

and controllable by control means being substantially in the form of a column-shaped 
unit, and a support device (19) being provided which together with the housing (34) 

supports the driving mechanism (22, 24, 26, 29) and the gate leaf (6), characterised in 
that the support device (19) has at least one cylindrical surface-portion (20) for receiving 

the bearing members (16, 16') of the gate leaf (6), the at least one surface portion (20) 
and thereby the bearing members (16, 16') being arranged coaxial with the pivot axis 

(33) of the gate leaf (6), and in that a pivot arm (27) is provided and is connected in a 
rotationally-locked manner to the drive shaft (26) and to the pivot part (7) of the gate leaf 

(6). 
A swing gate in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that the support device (19) is 
in the form of a hollow part through the centre of which the drive shaft (26) passes. 
A swing gate in accordance with Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the drive shaft (26) is 
rotatably mounted in a lower plate (21) fixedly connected to the support device (19) and 

in an upper plate (12) fixedly connected to the upper housing-portion (11). 
A swing gate in accordance with Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the drive shaft (26) is 
rotatably mounted in the support device (19) and in an upper plate (12) fixedly connected 

to the upper housing-portion (11). 
A swing gate in accordance with any one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the lower 
bearing member (16') is supported by means of its upper ring (17) with respect to the 

inside wall of the pivot part (7), and in that the higher-arranged bearing member (16) is 
fitted into the bearing plate (8).  

 
A swing gate in accordance with any one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the lower 
bearing element (16') is supported with respect to the inside wall of the pivot part (7) via 

a supporting ring or O-ring (18), and in that the higher-arranged bearing member (16) is 
fitted into the bearing plate (8). 
A swing gate in accordance with any one of Claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the pivot 
arm (27) spans
 the support device (19) and has a pin (28) which extends through an 
opening (15) - located in the upper plate (12) and at least semi-circular in shape when 

viewed from above - and into an opening (9) in the bearing plate (8). 
A swing gate in accordance with any one of Claims 1 to 7, characterised in that the upper 
part (30) of the brake device in the form of a solenoid brake (29) is connected in a 

rotationally-locked manner to the bearing plate (8), and the lower part (31) is connected 
to the support device (19) so as to be secured against rotation. 
A swing gate in accordance with any one of Claims 1 to 8, characterised in that the 
coupling (24) is arranged within the support part. 
A swing gate in accordance with any one of Claims 1 to 9, characterised in that the 
electric motor (22) is detachably mounted on the underside of the support device (19). 
A swing gate in accordance with any one of Claims 1 to 10, characterised in that the 
support device (19) may be screwed to the floor.
