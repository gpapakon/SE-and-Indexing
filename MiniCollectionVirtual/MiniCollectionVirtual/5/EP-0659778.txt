<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing solid catalytic
components of the Ziegler-Natta type, suitable for the
synthesis of elastomeric copolymers having a high
purity.The present invention also relates to the use of
these catalytic components in the synthesis of elastomeric
copolymers of ethylene with propylene, prevalently
amorphous and with a high purity.It is known in the art that prevalently amorphous
polymers of ethylene with propylene can be advantageously
produced using Ziegler-Natta type catalysts, as
described in G.Natta, G.Mazzanti et al., Journal of
Polymer Science Vol. 51 (1961) page 411, and in
Fr-A-2,027457.These catalysts consist of at least two components:
a) a salt of a transition metal belonging to a group 
from IV to VIII of the periodic table,b) an organometallic compound of a metal belonging to
a group from I to IV of the periodic table.To obtain copolymers characterized by a low
crystallinity, sufficiently narrow distribution of
molecular weights and composition, a Vanadium compound
is preferred as the transition metal salt: in this case
the complete catalytic system comprises a third component
(c) capable of raising the polymerization productivity
expressed as Kg of polymer produced per gram of
Vanadium per hour.Type "a" components particularly used are salts of
Vanadium with a valence of from 3 to 5, such as for
example Vanadium halides, Vanadium oxyhalides, Vanadium
or Vanadyl alcoholates and Vanadium acetylacetonate.Preferred type "b" components are organometallic
compounds of Aluminium such as Aluminium trialkyls,
Aluminium alkylhalides.The type "c" components are generally halogenated
organic compounds of the chloroalkane or chloroester
type such as for example CHCl3, CCl4, ethyltrichloroacetate
or n-butyl perchlorocrotonate.For the production of ethylene-propylene elastomeric
copolymers, both solution and suspension processes
are used. The solution processes are characterized in that
both the monomers and the polymers are dissolved in a
hydrocarbon medium whereas in the suspension processes
the polymerization is carried out in a medium in which
the elastomer is substantially insoluble. This latter
process generally comprises liquid propylene as suspending
medium and has considerable economical advantages
with respect to the solution, in particular:
i) high concentrations of polymer can be used in the
reactor without causing great increases in viscosity in
the reaction medium;ii) no solvents or suspending agents are used which are
extraneous to the
