further comprising a computer (104) coupled to the display 
(108) and the mechanical arm (34) which tracks the location of 

the surgical tool (38) through physical space, performs a

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system in accordance with 
the preamble of claim 1 for guiding a surgeon interactively 
through a surgical procedure, and more particularly to an 
integrated system of hardware and software which allows for 
the intuitive use of imaging-derived data regarding a 
patient's anatomy in order to guide a surgeon through a 
surgical procedure, and further to a method of observing a 
human body in accordance with the preamble of claim 7. There are a number of well-known diagnostic imaging techniques 
that allow a physician to obtain high fidelity views of the 
human body. Imaging systems which provide cross-sectional 
(tomographic) views of anatomical structure without invasive 
procedures include computed tomography (CT) X-ray imagers and 
magnetic resonance (MR) imagers. A problem associated with the scanning techniques is that each 
imaging process is sensitive to the patient's position within 
the imaging device. Therefore, each set of images has a discrete, 
unique orientation. Thus, images formed from the same 
modality at different times and images formed at essentially 
the same time, but from different imaging modalities (for 
example, CT and MRI) cannot be compared on a point-by-point 
basis. This prevents accurate comparison of regions within the 
images. A surgeon also deals with orientation differences to the 
imaging space. For example, although a neurosurgeon will known 
where his surgical tool is with regards to certain anatomic 
landmarks he may not know with the desired precision where the 
tool is with regard to the lesion visible on the images.  There have been attempts to solve this problem by temporary 
attachment of a relatively large brace-like structure 
surgically attached to portions of the body, such as the head. 
By orienting a surgical tool with respect to this structure, 
and by knowing the location of internal anatomical areas of 
interest with relation to this attached structure, the 
position of the surgical tool with respect to the anatomical 
areas of interest will be known. A problem with these structures is their size and their 
interference with normal daily activities, such as sleeping. 
The structures are therefore not used over a long period of 
time (e.g. for more than 12 hours) so that a comparison of 
images, or the location of a specific point within the 
anatomy, taken over a substantial time period is not 
practical. The primary object of the present invention is therefore to 
provide an interactive system which will guide a

An interactive system guiding the use of a surgical tool 
(38) using at least one imaging technique, characterized by a 

mechanical arm (34) having a fixed base (36) and a tool holder 
that holds the surgical tool (38) at a second end and a 

display (108) which displays at least one image from an image 
space of a patient's anatomy (18), the interactive system 

further comprising; 
and a computer (104) coupled to the display (108) and the 

mechanical arm (34) which tracks the location of the surgical 
tool (38) through physical space, performs a transforming 

rotation of the physical space to the image space, and causes 
said display (108) to display the location of the surgical 

tool (38) within the image space. 
The system of claim 1, wherein said mechanical (38) arm has 
joints (42) and means for electrically encoding movement of 

said joints relative to said base (36), said means for encoding 
being coupled to said computer (104) to provide said 

computer (104) with the electrically encoded movements of said 
joints (42). 
The system of claim 2, wherein the means (46) for 
electrically encoding movement of said joints are optical 

encoders (46). 
The system of claim 3, wherein one optical encoder (46) is 
provided for each degree of freedom of said of said mechanical 

arm (38). 
The system of one or more of the preceding claims, wherein 
said mechanical arm (38) is sterilizable. 
The system of one or more of the preceding claims, wherein 
a plurality of images of the image space are displayed by said 

display (108) with the images being provided by different 
imaging techniques. 
A method of observing a human anatomy (18) including scanning 
a portion of the patient's anatomy (18) using an imaging 

technique, or system particularly in accordance with one or 
more of the preceding claims, characterized by 

locating an internal point of reference within the patient's 
anatomy (18) using the results of the scanning step; 

initializing an end tip (39) of a surgical tool (38) on a 
manipulable articulated arm (33) by placing said end tip (39) 

in a known relationship with said internal point of reference 
and noting said initializing in a computer (104); 

tracking movement in the computer (104) of the end tip (39) of 
the surgical tool (38) through space; 

displaying in real time the location of the end tip (39) of 
the surgical tool (38) with respect to the scanned portion; 
The method of claim 7, further comprising implanting 
fiducial implants (10) in the patient's anatomy (18) to serve 

as internal points of reference. 
The method of claim 8, wherein the tracking step includes 
encoding the movements of joints (42) in the arm (33) and 

sending the encoded movements to the computer (104).

The method of claim 10, further comprising establishing an 
external coordinate system related to a fixed base (36) of 

said arm, the position in space of said base (36) being stored
