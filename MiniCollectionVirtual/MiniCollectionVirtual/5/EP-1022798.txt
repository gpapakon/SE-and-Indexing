<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a nonaqueous
electrolyte secondary battery.Recently, a lithium ion secondary battery is put
on the market as a nonaqueous secondary battery used in
a portable electrical appliance such as a portable
telephone. The battery comprises a positive electrode
containing lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2), a negative
electrode containing a graphite material or a
carbonaceous material, a nonaqueous electrolyte
prepared by dissolving a lithium salt in an organic
solvent, a separator formed of a porous membrane, and
a metal jacket formed of a cylindrical or rectangular
metal case.With decrease in the thickness of a portable
appliance, it is requested that the nonaqueous
secondary battery be made smaller in thickness and
lighter in weight. In order to decrease the thickness
of the lithium ion secondary battery to 4 mm or less,
it is necessary to decrease the thickness of the metal
case used as a jacket.However, if the thickness of the metal case is
decreased, it is difficult to form the metal case
itself. Thus, it was substantially difficult to put
a lithium ion secondary battery having a thickness not
larger than 4 mm to a practical use.On the other hand, U.S. Patent No. 5,437,692 
discloses a lithium ion secondary battery, in which an
electrode group consisting of a positive electrode, a
negative electrode and a gel-like polymer electrolyte
arranged between the positive and negative electrodes
is sealed in a battery housing. The inventions
disclosed in these U.S. Patents are intended to improve
the cycle life by increasing the mobility of the
lithium ions. Also, the details of the battery housing
are not described at all in these U.S. Patents.However, the secondary battery disclosed in this
prior art tends to give rise to an abnormal heat
generation or temperature elevation because of an
external short-circuiting, an over-charging or leaving
to stand under high temperatures not lower than 130°C,
leading to a dangerous situation that the viscosity of
the polymer electrolyte layer is lowered so as to bring
the positive electrode into contact with the negative
electrode. This internal short-circuiting tends to
take place so as to bring about a danger of explosion.An object of the present invention is to provide
a nonaqueous electrolyte secondary battery with an
improved safety.According to a first aspect of the present
invention, there is provided a nonaqueous electrolyte
secondary battery, comprising an electrode group
including a positive electrode, a negative electrode,
and a porous
