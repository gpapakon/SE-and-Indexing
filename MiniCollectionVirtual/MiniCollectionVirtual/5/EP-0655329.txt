<ABSTRACT>
A printing switching apparatus for a sheet-fed 
rotary press with a reversing mechanism includes a fixed 

gear (32), a rotary gear (33), a fixing unit, and a proximity 
switch (53). The fixed gear is fixed to the shaft of a first 

cylinder. The rotary gear is coaxial with the fixed 
gear, coupled to be driven with a second adjacent 

cylinder along a paper convey direction, and 
phase-adjustable with respect to the fixed gear in a 

circumferential direction. The fixing unit fixes the 
rotary gear to one of the fixed gear and the shaft of 

the first cylinder to perform rotational transmission 
such that phase switching of the rotary gear between 

single-sided printing and perfecting printing is 
performed when the fixing means is released, and the 

rotary gear is not fixed to one of the fixed gear and 
the shaft of the first cylinder. The proximity switch 

detects that the rotary gear is positioned in a phase of 
single-sided printing when the rotary gear is fixed to 

one of the fixed gear and the shaft of the first 
cylinder by the fixing means.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a printing
switching apparatus according to the preamble of claim
1. The printing switching apparatus is e.g. arranged in a
sheet-fed rotary press with a reversing mechanism
capable of performing both single-sided printing and
perfecting printing, for adjusting circumferential phases
of upstream and downstream cylinders with respect to a
reversing cylinder in switching between single-sided
printing and perfecting printing.Various sheet-fed rotary presses each capable
of performing single-sided printing and perfecting printing
have been proposed and put into practice along with
a variety of printing techniques. An example of such a
rotary press is disclosed in Japanese Utility Model Publication
No. 4-34034 in which a transfer cylinder, a double-diameter
cylinder having a diameter twice that of the
transfer cylinder, and a reversing cylinder are arranged
between an upstream impression cylinder and a downstream
impression cylinder along a paper convey direction.
The sheet-fed rotary press disclosed in this prior
art has a fixed gear fixed at the end shaft of the reversing
cylinder, a rotary gear coaxial with the fixed gear and
phase-adjustable in a circumferential direction, and a
single-sided printing reference pin free to be inserted
into pin holes formed in the gears. When single-sided
printing is to be performed, the reference pin is inserted
into the pin holes of the fixed and rotary gears, thereby
matching the phases of the fixed gear and the rotary
gear in single-sided printing. When perfecting printing is
to be performed, the reference pin is removed from the
pin hole of the fixed gear, and the rotary gear is phase-adjusted
with respect to the fixed gear by an almost the
longitudinal length of a paper sheet. Because of such a
reference pin, a paper sheet does not fail to be gripped
between the double-diameter cylinder and the reversing
cylinder. Therefore, waste paper or damage to the
machine can be prevented.However, in the above-described conventional
printing switching apparatus for switching between single-sided
printing and perfecting printing, if, in switching
from single-sided printing to perfecting printing, an operator
performs the switching operation while leaving the
reference pin unremoved, the machine may be damaged.
In addition, in switching from perfecting printing to
single-sided printing, if the operator does not confirm
that the reference pin is properly inserted into the pin
hole of the fixed gear, the following problem is posed. If
the fixed gear
