<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a
digital data recording apparatus, and more particularly to
a digital data recording apparatus adapted for recording
digital multichannel audio signals in different areas of a recording
medium and for reproducing audio signals from the recording
medium.Recently, the recording of audio signals such as
music sound in a recording medium such as a compact disk is
made by using multitrack digital audio data recording
technology. A multitrack digital audio tape recorder is
desirable because it can record audio signals in a
recording medium and can reproduce audio signals from the
recording medium with no significant deterioration of sound
quality if the dubbing is repeated. There is an increasing
need for a compact, less expensive multitrack digital audio
tape recorder for personal or home uses.Conventional 16-track, 32-track, 48-track or
64-track digital audio tape recorders have been commonly
used in recording studios or the like. It is necessary for
the conventional recorders mentioned above to use a
magnetic tape having a large width in which a plurality of
tracks extending in parallel to the longitudinal direction
of the tape are formed to record audio signals. For this
reason, the above conventional recorders will become a
large scale system and will be expensive. Also, in the
above multitrack digital audio tape recorders, it is
difficult to increase the speed of reading and writing 
audio signals from and to the magnetic tape.In order to increase the speed of reading and
writing, an improved multitrack digital data recording
method has been proposed. In the improved recording method
mentioned above, a plurality of tracks extending obliquely
to the longitudinal direction of a magnetic tape are formed
for a higher recording density and a speedier reading and
writing. However, when the improved recording method is
applied to a multitrack digital audio tape recorder, it is
necessary to use a large-scale time base corrector for
enabling a higher recording density on a recording medium.
Thus, there is a problem in that the multitrack digital
tape recorder using such a time base corrector will become
bulky and expensive.A conceivable method for constructing a less
expensive, compact multitrack digital audio tape recorder
is to make use of a mechanical deck of 8mm video tape
recorder (VTR) and an integrated signal processor of rotary
digital audio tape recorder (RDAT), as described in EP-A-0 146 773. The 8mm VRTs are
widely prevailing in recent years since they are
