<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a process for obtaining polyester articles, including foamed articles, containing low levels of extractable branching agent. The process comprises: (1) forming a molten mixture comprising (i) a major amount of a first resin composition comprising polyester and from 0 up to about 1 wt. % of a compound capable of branching the polyester, and (ii) a minor amount of a second polyester resin composition comprising at least about 50 wt. % polyester resin and greater than about 2 wt. % of a compound capable of branching the polyester, wherein the relative amounts of (i) and (ii) are such that said molten mixture comprises from about 0.1 wt. % to about 1 wt. % of said branching compound; (2) adding a blowing agent to the molten mixture; and (3) extruding the resultant mixture to obtain a foam. The invention is also directed to the second composition used in the above process, and foamed polyester articles obtained from the process.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to polyester extrusion in which polyester melt strength is enhanced
by reacting the polyester with a polyfunctional branching compound. More particularly, the invention concerns (1) a
resin concentrate (used in a process) obtained by melt processing a polyester with greater than 2 wt.% and preferably
greater than 5 wt.% of branching compound based on the weight of the polyester; (2) a stable process for manufacturing
polyester foam in which the above concentrate is mixed at prescribed levels with the polyester to be foamed; and (3)
a process for abtaining
polyester articles such as building insulation board with insulation values exceeding R-4 per inch, food service products,
and food packaging products, all having reduced levels of unreacted branching agent. Compared with processes in
which a polyester to be foamed is combined directly with neat branching compound and then foamed, we have discovered
that the pre-mixed concentrate of the present invention can substantially improve the stability of the polyester
foam extrusion process and reduce the amount of unreacted branching agent present in articles fabricated from the
polyester foam. Use of the concentrate of the invention reduces viscosity of the polyester extrusion mass near the
loading end of the extruder, while achieving desired melt strength enhancement toward the end of the extrusion line.
Hence, substantial throughput enhancements can be attained in foam as well as non-foam polyester melt fabrication
processes.US-A-5,000,991 discloses a process for producing a thermoplastic polyester resin foam comprising melting
a thermoplastic polyester resin, mixing the molten resin with a blowing agent and extruding the mixture into a low-pressure
zone to carry out expansion molding. According to lines 42-47 of Column 6, the thermoplastic resin may be
mixed with a compound having two or more acid anhydride groups per molecule. However lines 11-13 of Column 5
teaches that when the amount of anhydride exceeds 5.0 parts by weight, the gelation of the molten material of the
thermoplastic polyester resin proceeds and extrusion foaming cannot be effected.Articles prepared from foamed polymers offer well known advantages over those made from unexpanded
materials. There is a growing desire to successfully commercialize foamed articles obtained from crystalline or semi-crystalline
polyesters, primarily polyethylene terephthalate, ("PET"). Based on its resin properties, PET can be expected
to provide better mechanical and
