<ABSTRACT>
Thin-layer magnetic head including, on a substrate (1):   - a first magnetic pole (2) having a flank (20) making an angle (perpendicular) with the face of the substrate; - a second magnetic pole (3) having a flank (30) substantially parallel to the flank (20) of the first magnetic pole (2), the two flanks (20) and (30) being separated by a layer of a magnetic material.   The invention also relates to a method of producing such a head. The invention is applicable in particular in the domain of magnetic tape recorders/players.

Thin-film magnetic read/write head, comprising;

a piece of substrate (1) made of magnetic
material, having a principal face (10);
a first magnetic circuit pole (2) lying in
this principal face (10) and having a first side wall

(20) making an angle with the principal face (10);
a second magnetic circuit pole (3) lying on the
principal face (10) with a layer (4) of a non-magnetic

material lying between the second pole (3) and the
principal face (10), this second pole (3) also having a

second side wall (30) approximately parallel to the
first side wall (20) and defining with the first side

wall (20) a gap of approximately constant thickness,

characterized in that it includes a piece of
non-magnetic material (9), lying under parts (22, 32)

of each pole (2, 3) adjacent to the side walls (20, 30)
of the gap, and at least a first magnetic induction

coil (7) which is located on the substrate (1) and on
the piece of non-magnetic material (9) and which

surrounds at least that part (21, 31) of a pole which
does not lie on the piece of non-magnetic material (9).
Magnetic head according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the piece of non-magnetic

material (9) is convexly curved.
Magnetic head according to Claim 1,
characterized in that it includes a second magnetic

induction coil (7') located on the layer of
non-magnetic material (4) so as to surround that part 

(31) of the second magnetic pole (3) which does not lie
above the piece of non-magnetic material (9).
Magnetic head according to either of claims 1
and 3, characterized in that the coils are coils of

helical form.
Magnetic head according to Claim 4,
characterized in that the coils are of planar form.
Magnetic head according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the entire space lying between

the principal face (10) of the substrate and the second
pole is occupied by the non-magnetic layer (4).
Process for the production of a thin-film
magnetic head according to one of the preceding claims,

characterized in that it comprises the following
successive steps:


a) a first step of producing a mesa (9)
covering a region of a substrate (1) which will

correspond to parts (22, 32) of the magnetic poles
(2, 3), including the side walls (20, 30);
b) a second step of producing a magnetic field
induction coil (7) which will subsequently have to

surround a part (21) of the first pole (2) not covering
the mesa (9);
c) a third step of depositing a first magnetic
pole (2), having a side wall (20) making an angle with

a face (10) of a substrate (1), on the face (10) of the
substrate (1) and of cutting the said first magnetic

pole;
d) a fourth step of depositing a layer of a
non-magnetic material (4) on the entire face of the

substrate (1) and first magnetic pole (2);
e) a fifth step of depositing a second magnetic
pole (3), part of which overlaps the side wall (20) of

the first pole, on the layer of non-magnetic material
(4) and of cutting the said second magnetic pole;
f) a sixth step of machining and of polishing
the layer of non-magnetic material (4) and the second

magnetic pole (3).
Process for the production of a thin-film
magnetic head according to Claim 7, characterized in

that, during the first four steps, several magnetic
heads are produced on the same substrate and in that it

includes a fifth step of cutting off at least one
magnetic head.
Production process according to Claim 8,
characterized in that it includes, between the third

and fourth steps, a phase for production of a magnetic
field induction coil (7') which will have to surround a

part (31) of the second pole (3) not covering the mesa
(9).
