<ABSTRACT>
A padded room for a veterinary hospital or the 
like comprises a foam layer (10) bonded to the walls and 

floor of the room and a polyurethane coating (15) spray-coated 
in situ onto the foam sheets to form a continuous 

skin. For formulation of the polyurethane coating provides 
a tough semi-rigid skin which, when bonded to the foam 

rubber, is able to withstand the substantial forces 
associated with use of the room by shod horses.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a padded room, and to a 
method for forming such a room. Veterinary treatment, particularly of larger 
animals such as horses and the like, may require the 
provision of special rooms for the anaesthetisation of, 
operation on, and recovery of these animals. The rooms are 
padded to reduce the risks of injury to the animals and, in 
particular, to provide protection should an animal fall 
whilst recovering from an operation. One known method of forming such a room is to use 
preformed, plastic or rubber covered foam panels or pads. 
These panels were laid to cover the floor and walls of the 
room and fixed in place, and the joins between the panels 
were sealed with mastic. However, in known constructions 
the mastic joints could fail allowing water, urine, blood 
and so on to collect beneath the panels, creating a build up 
of bacteria and causing hygiene problems. In addition, the 
plastic covering of the known pads could be torn, such that 
the foam could become impregnated with water, urine, blood 
etc., causing further hygiene problems. The present invention aims to provide a padded 
room for use in an animal hospital, or the like, which is 
completely without seams or joints. Such a seamless room 
provides a clinically hygienic, easily cleaned surface.  According to one aspect of the present invention 
there is provided a padded room comprising rigid walls and 
floor; a layer of foam fixed to at least part of the walls 
and floor; and a continuous flexible coating forming the 
interior surface of at least part of the room, the 
continuous coating being formed in situ by spray coating the 
surface of the foam and being bonded to the foam to form an 
integral structure therewith. According to another aspect of the present 
invention there is provided a method of forming a padded 
room comprising the steps of: 
a) fixing a foam layer to at least part of the 
interior of the room; and b) spraying a flexible coating over the foam layer 
to bond to the foam layer and form a completely seamless 
inner surface for said at least part of the interior of the 
room. Preferably, the foam layer is fixed to the floor 
and walls of the room. Advantageously, the method additionally comprises 
the steps of cleaning and priming the walls and floor prior 
to adhesively fixing the foam layer to them. The foam layer on the floor is preferably twice 
the thickness of the foam layer on the walls. In a particularly preferred embodiment of the 
invention the foam is pre-formed in sheets of a given

<CLAIMS>
A padded room comprising rigid walls and floor; 
a layer of foam fixed to at least part of the walls and 

floor; and a continuous flexible coating forming the 
interior surface of at least part of the room, the 

continuous coating being formed in situ by spray coating the 
surface of the foam and being bonded to the foam to form an 

integral structure therewith. 
A padded room according to Claim 1 wherein the 
foam layer is provided by pre-formed sheets of foam material 

which are adhesively bonded to the walls and/or the floor of 
the room. 
A padded room according to Claim 2 wherein the 
floor of the room is coated with the plurality of 

thicknesses of said pre-formed sheet material. 
A padded room according to any preceding claim 
wherein the foam layer is of foamed natural rubber. 
A padded room according to any preceding claim 
wherein the sprayed coating is a polyurethane coating. 
A padded room according to any preceding claim 
wherein the spray coating is bonded to the foam layer to 

provide an integral structure. 
A padded room according to any preceding claim 
wherein the surface of the foam layer onto which the spray-coating 

is applied is treated to promote bonding of the 
 

sprayed coating to the foam layer. 
According to any preceding claim wherein the 
foamed layer is a foamed natural rubber; the sprayed coating 

is a polyurethane coating; and the surface of the foamed 
rubber against which the sprayed coating is applied is pretreated 

to provide a nitrile/PVC skin to enhance bonding of 
the polyurethane coating to the natural rubber foam. 
A method of forming a padded room comprising the 
steps of: 


a) fixing a foam layer to at least part of the 
interior of the room; and 
b) spraying a flexible coating over the foam layer 
to bond to the foam layer and form a completely seamless 

inner surface for said at least part of the interior of the 
room. 
A method according to Claim 9 wherein the coating 
comprises a polyurethane coating the components of which are 

mixed in a metering machine immediately prior to 
application.
