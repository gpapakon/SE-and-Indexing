<ABSTRACT>
A stone cutting method 
for cutting stone used as a 

tile that is used for a pavement 
or a floor comprising 

the steps of positioning and 
placing on a table (21) a lower 

protection plate (20) to 
which a lower elongate cutting 

protrusion (30) that is 
formed into a predetermined 

configuration is attached, 
then placing a stone to be cut 

on said lower elongate cutting 
protrusion (30) on said 

lower protection plate (20), 
positioning and placing an 

upper protection plate (18) 
on which an upper elongate 

cutting protrusion (30a) that 
is formed similar in shape to 

that of said lower elongate 
cutting protrusion (30a) is attached, 

and pressing down 
said upper protection plate using a press machine to thereby cut said stone to be cut. A stone cutting device for cutting stone used 

as a tile that is used for a pavement or a floor comprising a press portion (14a), a pump unit (31) and an electric control panel 
(36), wherein cutting plates (29a, 29b) on which the completely same elongate cutting protrusions (30a, 30b) are formed, respectively, 

are releasably mounted on upper and lower protection plates (18, 20), respectively. With said stone material cutting method 
and device it is possible to cut stone.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to improvement of a method 
and an apparatus for cutting a stone based material of which 
cut product can conveniently be used for constructing a 
walking road, a building floor, a building wall or the like. A stone based material has been heretofore cut by 
employing a conventional cutting method as typically shown in 
Fig. 6, Fig. 7 and Fig. 8. Specifically, Fig. 6 shows a 
conventional method of cutting a stone based material 4 by 
ejecting a high pressure water stream 8 having abrasive 
particles contained therein toward the stone based material 4, 
Fig. 7 shows a convectional method of cutting a stone based 
material 4 by reciprocably displacing a cutting wire 9 having 
diamond particles adhesively secured thereto in the 
leftward/rightward direction as represented by arrow marks 
while ejecting a water stream toward the cutting wire 9, and 
Fig. 8 shows a conventional method of cutting a stone based 
material 4 by rotating a rotary cutting blade 10 having 
diamond particles involved therein while ejecting a water 
stream 11 toward the outer periphery of the rotary cutting 
blade 10. However, the conventional method of cutting a stone based 
material 4 by ejecting the high pressure water stream 8 having 
abrasive particles contained therein as shown in Fig. 6 has a 
drawback that each cutting operation is achieved at an 
increased cost. In addition, another conventional cutting 
method shown in Fig. 10 has drawbacks that an upper cut part 
13 of a stone based material 4 formed by ejecting a high  
 
pressure water stream toward the stone base material 4 has an 
increased width but a lower cut part of the same has a reduced 
width, causing each cutting operation to be irregularly 
achieved across the cut plane of the stone based material 4, 
and moreover, stone particles are scattered away from the 
stone based material 4. In addition, the conventional method of cutting a stone 
based material 4 by reciprocably displacing the cutting wire 9 
having diamond particles adhesively secured thereto as shown 
in Fig. 7 has a drawback that each cutting operation is 
achieved at an increased cost in the same manner as the 
conventional cutting method having a high pressure water 
stream employed therefor. Another drawback is that a cut 
plane 12 on the stone based material 4 has some ruggedness as 
typically illustrated in Fig. 9. Additionally, the conventional method of cutting a stone 
based material 4 by rotating the rotary cutting blade 10 while 
ejecting the water stream 11

<CLAIMS>
A method of cutting a stone based material, characterized 
in that said method comprises a step of placing on a platform 

a lower elastic plate having a lower cutting wire having a 
lower cutting protuberance formed thereon at a predetermined 

position, said lower cutting protuberance being formed to 
exhibit a desired contour, a step of placing on said lower 

elastic plate a stone based material to be cut, a step of 
securing an upper elastic plate having an upper cutting 

protuberance formed thereon to the moving part of a press 
machine at a predetermined position positionally coincident 

with the foregoing predetermined position, said upper cutting 
protuberance being formed to exhibit the same or the 

substantially same contour as that of said lower cutting 
protuberance, and a step of op
erating said press machine to 
cut said stone based material by bringing said upper cutting 

protuberance of said upper elastic material in compressing 
contact with said lower cutting protuberance of said lower 

elastic plate. 
A method of cutting a stone based material as claimed in 
claim 1, characterized in that said lower cutting protuberance 

and said upper cutting protuberance exhibit a square contour, 
respectively.
