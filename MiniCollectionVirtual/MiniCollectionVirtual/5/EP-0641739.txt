<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sol and a fine
powder of sodium magnesium fluoride useful for a coating
material for an anti-reflection coating for e.g. lenses
or cathode ray tubes or image display surfaces of liquid
crystal display devices, useful for a laser window
material, or useful for a laser optical element, and
processes for their production.GB-A-567 260 discloses the preparation of NaMgF3 by reaction of magnesium sulfate
and sodium fluoride.DE-A-1 467 258 discloses a process for producing MgF2. It is common to apply anti-reflection treatment to
lenses or to cathode ray tubes or to image display
surfaces of liquid crystal display devices for the
purposes of reducing reflection of exterior lights such
as sunlight or electric light and increasing the
transmittance of lights. The anti-reflection treatment
is carried out usually by a vacuum deposition method or
by a coating method, and as the outermost layer,
magnesium fluoride or silica having a low refractive
index is, for example, used. It is known that a sol or a
fine powder of magnesium fluoride is particularly 
effective as a microfiller for an anti-reflection coating
agent. However, magnesium fluoride particles have a
drawback that the dispersibility is poor, and the desired
transparency can not be obtained unless the diameter of
primary particles is substantially reduced. The
productivity will be poor to attain such a small diameter
for primary particles.The following process has been reported as a process
for producing a sol and a fine powder of magnesium
fluoride. Namely, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication
No. 124332/1988 proposes a process for producing an
acidic aqueous dispersion of colloidal particles of
magnesium fluoride by adding an aqueous hydrofluoric acid
solution to an aqueous solution of a mixture of magnesium
acetate and polyvinyl alcohol. The aqueous dispersion of
colloidal particles obtained by this process has pH2 and
has a drawback that at a concentration of 5 wt% or
higher, it immediately undergoes gelation after its
preparation.Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 41149/1989
proposes a method for preventing reflection by coating on
a screen panel of a cathode ray tube a sol composed of
fine particles of magnesium fluoride having a particle
diameter of from 100 to 200 Å. However, there is no
report on the method for producing this sol.Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 26824/1990
discloses an aqueous or organo sol of magnesium fluoride 
having a light transmittance of at least 50%, and a
product with
