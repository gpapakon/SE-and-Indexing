<ABSTRACT>
A vibrating linear conveyor has a baseplate (32) and an oscillating conveyor track (4). The latter forms, together with a trimming weight (8) an oscillating mass (M1). Furthermore, a countermass (10) forming a mass (M2) oscillating in the opposite direction is provided. The support of the mutually oscillating masses (M1 and M2) relative to the baseplate (32) takes place via spring elements (2, 14) formed by leaf springs (31). An electromagnetic oscillating drive supplied with a timed direct voltage engages between the masses (M1 and M2) oscillating in opposition. A link (24) acting in an elastically damped manner is provided between the masses (M1 and M2) oscillating in opposition, so that the masses (M1 and M2) oscillate exactly in opposition to one another even when they are out of tune.
