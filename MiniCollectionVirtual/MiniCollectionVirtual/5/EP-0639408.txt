<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an atomiser with a nozzle (2) for atomising a liquid (4), preferably having a flow-through rate of 1 to 10 litres/hour and preferably spraying out droplets with a diameter of less than 150 mu m, which has a nozzle bore (10) - preferably with a diameter of less than 2 mm, preferably 0.6 mm to 0.8 mm, characterised in that there opens in the nozzle bore (10) at least one line (26), through which, in the operating state of the nozzle (2), gas, in particular air, is sucked into the nozzle bore (10), and in that the line (26) is assigned a control valve (28) for adjusting the rate of this gas, in particular the air.
