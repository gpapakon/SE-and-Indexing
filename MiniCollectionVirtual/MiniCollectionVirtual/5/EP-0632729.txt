<DESCRIPTION>
TITLE: ANTI-ZONA PELLUCIDA ANTIBODIES FORDELIVERY OF THERAPEUTIC AGENTS TO THE OVARYFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to antibodies which specifically bind to zona pellucida and to immuno- chemical agents made from those antibodies, and to therapeutic methods utilizing such immunochemical agents.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONOvarian disease, and particularly ovarian cancer is preferably treated by agents which are specifically targeted to the ovary. In addition, agents for fertility control may be more effective when such agents are specifically directed and distributed to the ovary and not diluted in other, non-ovarian tissues. The mammalian zona pellucida surrounds the oocytes present within the ovary. Its unique structure includes a novel glycoprotein network. Because of the unique nature of the zona pellucida proteins, antibodies raised against these proteins are generally specific to the ovary. Thus, anti-zona pellucida antibodies are ideally suited as carriers for targeting therapeutic agents to the ovary.Cytotoxic agents have been conjugated to ovarian tumor cells and specific tumor cell antigens for the purpose of targeting delivery of the cytotoxic agent to tumor tissues (See, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,956,453 to Bjorn et al; 4,806,494 to Pastan et al; and 4,925,922 to Byers et al) . Delivery of the agent to the ovary requires that the ovarian tissue contain the specific tumor antigen recognized by the antibody.While such antibody recognition may be expected when 

the antibody is raised against the patient's own tumor cells, tumor antigens vary from one patient to another and a single antibody may not be expected to carry cytotoxic agents to the ovaries of all patients. In addition, non-carcinogenic conditions of the ovary would benefit from targeted delivery of therapeutic agents. Targeted, specific delivery of therapeutic agents is desired to enable lower dosages of therapeutic agents and specific ovarian action of non- specific agents. Targeted, specific delivery of therapeutic agents is desired to enable use of lower dosages of therapeutic agents, especially those which may be detrimental to normal tissues, and to permit specific ovarian action of non-specific agents. It would be of great utility to provide antibodies for use in specifically targeting therapeutic agents t,o the ovary, which antibodies did not rely on the recognition of antigens which vary from patient to patient.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONMonoclonal and polyclonal antibodies raised against zona pellucida

<CLAIMS>
WE CLAIM :
1. A pharmaceutical composition comprising: an anti-zona pellucida antibody; a therapeutic agent conjugated to said anti- zona pellucida antibody, wherein said anti-zona pellucida antibody specifically bindε to ovarian tissue and thereby delivers the conjugated therapeutic agent to the ovary.
2. The pharmaceutical composition of claim 1, wherein said antibody is a polyclonal antibody.
3. The pharmaceutical composition of claim 1 wherein said antibody is a monoclonal antibody.
4. The pharmaceutical compoεition of claim 1 wherein said antibody is raised against a recombinant zona pellucida polypeptide.
5. The pharmaceutical composition of claim 1 wherein said therapeutic agent is a cytotoxin.
6. The pharmaceutical composition of claim 1 wherein said therapeutic agent is a radioisotope.
7. The pharmaceutical composition of claim 1, wherein said therapeutic agent iε a fertility control agent.
8. The pharmaceutical compoεition of claim 5, wherein said therapeutic agent is ricin. 


 9. A method of delivering a therapeutic agent to the ovary, said method comprising: conjugating a therapeutic agent to an antibody having specificity to ovarian zona pellucida; and administering to an individual a therapeutically effective amount of the antibody-agent conjugate for delivery of the therapeutic agent to the ovary.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein said therapeutic agent is a cytotoxin.
11. The method of claim 10, wherein said therapeutic agent is ricin A.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein said therapeutic agent is a radioisotope.
13. The method of claim 9, wherein said therapeutic agent is a fertility control agent.
14. A method for treating ovarian disease comprising administering to a patient in need of such treatment an effective therapeutic amount of the pharmaceutical composition of claim 1.
15. A method for inducing recruitment of ovarian follicles compriεing adminiεtering an effective dose of ricin conjugated to anti-zona pellucida antibody. 


 16. A method of inducing contraception in an animal comprising: inducing recruitment of primary ovarian follicles into tertiary follicles by administration of ricin-conjugated to anti-zona pellucida antibody; and inducing atresia of tertiary ovarian follicles.
