<ABSTRACT>
To make possible interactive control operations in a device such as a minidisc system 
which uses a recording medium on which character information can be recorded. There 

is provided a recording medium on which sound information and management 
information for managing recording and playback operations is recorded, and on which 

predetermined character string information is recorded as commands in a region of the 
management information in which character information can be recorded. And, a 

recording and playback device (30) is provided with command read-in means (3-10, 12, 
21), which reads in commands from the disc (1), control means (11), which, according 

to the commands read in, executes control of operations as specified by those 
commands, and input-output means (16, 17, 19, 20), controlled by the control means 

(11), required to execute the operations indicated by the read-in commands.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to recording media, such as for example discs and tapes, 
and to recording devices and reproduction devices for use with these recording 
media. As reproduction devices which can reproduce for example music and speech, 
etc., recording media such as optical discs, optical-magnetic discs and magnetic tape, 
which record audio signals as digital signals, are widely used, and are known as 
compact discs, or DAT (digital audio tape), etc. In particular, recently, an optical-magnetic disc (the so-called minidisc) with 
which not only is reproduction possible but -also it is possible for the user to record 
sounds, such as pieces of music, has been developed. In this minidisc system, as the recording media, there are optical-magnetic 
discs, with which user recording/playback is possible, optical discs, on which pieces 
of music or the like are prerecorded as bit information and which are designated as 
being for playback only (premastered type), and hybrid types, in which both of these 
are combined. These are generally used for recording audio signals; however, in the case of 
the minidisc it is possible to record such information as the title of the disc (the album 
title) and the music titles of pieces of music prerecorded on the disc or of programs 
such as pieces of music, etc., recorded by the user, as character information, and it is 
possible for example during playback for the disc title and the music title, and the 
name of the artist, etc., to be displayed by a display part mounted on the playback 
device.  As an optical disc with which it is possible to enjoy games, music, and moving 
images, etc., interactively, CD-I (compact disc-interactive) is already known. However, 
in the structure of the data in CD-I, the program regions and the music and image 
data, etc., regions are intermixed, and there is no particular distinction between them. In the case of minidisc and compact disc systems, there is no interactivity with 
respect to the disc, and a function which interactively controls the playback of 
recorded music and the like is not provided, as it is in the system known as CD-I 
(compact disc-interactive), and it is not possible for example for the user to set the 
order in which pieces of music are played through interaction with the recording 
medium. It is noted that in the case of CD players and minidisc players, although, in what 
is called program playback, the order in which pieces of music are played can be 
specified by operation of the player, and audio

<CLAIMS>
A recording medium (1) on which management information for managing 
recording/playback operations is recorded together with one or a plurality of units of 

audio information, wherein the recording medium (1) is further provided with a 
character recording region for management information in which character information 

can be recorded, and predetermined character string information is recorded as 
commands in this character recording region. 
A recording medium (1) according to claim 1, wherein the character string 
information which constitutes the commands is made to be commands which control 

data recording operations or data reproduction operations or editing operations in a 
recording device or a reproduction device for use with the recording medium, or 

display operations in a displaying means (20), or audio output operations not based on 
data reproduction. 
A recording medium (1) according to claim 1, wherein the character string 
information which constritutes the commands is made to be commands which control 

operation input read-in operations, or audio input presence/absence or level detection 
operations, in recording device or a reproducion device for use with the recording 

medium. 
A recording medium (1) according to claim 1, wherein the character string 
information which constitutes the commands is made to be commands which control 

variable substitution computation operations, or numerical logic computation 
operations, or built-in function computation operations or process flow judgment 

operations, with respect to a recording device or a reproduction device for use with the 
recording medium. 
A recording/reproduction device (30) for use with a recording medium (1) on which 
management information for managing recording/playback operations is recorded 

together with one or a plurality of units of audio information, the recording medium (1) 
being further provided with a character recording region for management information, 

in which character information can be recorded, wherein predetermined character string 
information is recorded as commands in this character recording region, the 

recording/reproducion device (30) comprising: 
   command read-in means (3-10, 12, 21), for reading in character string 

information recorded as commands on the recording medium from the recording 
medium (1); 

   control means (11), for, according to the character string information read in by 
the command read-in means, controlling the execution of those indicated operations; 

and 
   input/output means (16, 17, 19, 20) controlled by the control means (11), 

required for executing the operations specified by the read-in character string 
information.
