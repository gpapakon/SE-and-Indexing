<ABSTRACT>
A machine for preparing hot drinks by infusion (1), having enhanced 
compact design features, comprises an infusion chamber (12) adapted to 

contain an infusion substance (C), and a means for moving (50) it between 
an infusion and hot drink-dispensing position and an infusion substance (C) 

fill and discharge position, whereby the filling with the infusion substance (C) 
and cleaning take place externally of the machine (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a machine for preparing hot drinks by 
infusion, comprising an infusion chamber adapted to contain an infusion 
substance. In particular, it relates to a machine, mainly intended for household 
use, for making "espresso" or "Italian" style coffee drinks from ground toasted 
coffee grains. The grindings may be supplied either in the form of a tablet or a wafer 
or in a porous paper bag, for example, to be introduced manually into the 
infusion chamber. After the ground coffee has been placed into the infusion chamber, it 
is pressed, either manually or with the aid of a special plug, to form a 
so-called pressed tablet. This is followed by the infusion process, which is initiated by injecting 
hot water under a pressure into the infusion chamber. The water, presently 
turned into a coffee drink, is then extracted through a filter and poured into 
a cup or thermal container. The amount of the water and its temperature are 
pre-set to enhance the organoleptic quality of the drink. A growing trend in current design is toward a more extensive recourse 
to automation in order to make machines of this kind ever easier to use. However, a full automation of the preparation process encounters 
significant problems yet to be solved. For instance, the manual introduction of pre-formed tablets or 
grindings is inconvenient, and involves contact of the infusion chamber inside 
the machine framework with harsh surroundings.  Also to be held in mind is the difficulty experienced to clean the 
infusion chamber, placed in the same harsh surroundings, especially on such 
occurrences as an incidental spillage of grindings or crushing of a pre-formed 
tablet. The inconvenience of this operation is also due to that machines of 
this kind are to feature compact size in view of their domestic destination, 
which tends to crowds the space available for the operation. Another problematic aspect is the need to discharge a spent pressed 
tablet and collect it into a specially provided container without fouling, as may 
result from a crushed pressed tablet, hard-to-reach areas. This discharge 
operation additionally involves the provision of a means of ejecting the spent 
pressed tablet from the bottom of the infusion chamber and discharging it 
directly into its collector. Such means is also a dedicated one unsuited to 
co-operation with other mechanisms of the machine, which contributes to the 
consequences already mentioned above. The underlying technical problem of this invention is to provide a 
machin
