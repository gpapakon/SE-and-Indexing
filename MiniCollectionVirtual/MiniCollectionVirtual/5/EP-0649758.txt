<ABSTRACT>
A dye-donor element for thermal dye transfer 
comprising a support having on one side thereof a dye 

layer and on the other side thereof, in order, a 
subbing layer comprising a polymer having an inorganic 

backbone which is an oxide of a Group IVa or IVb 
element and a slipping layer, and wherein an interlayer 

is located between the subbing layer and the slipping 
layer, the interlayer comprising a polymer having free 

hydroxyl groups.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to dye donor elements 
used in thermal dye transfer, and more particularly to 
the use of an interlayer located between a subbing 
layer and a slipping layer. In recent years, thermal transfer systems 
have been developed to obtain prints from pictures 
which have been generated electronically from a color 
video camera. According to one way of obtaining such 
prints, an electronic picture is first subjected to 
color separation by color filters. The respective 
color-separated images are then converted into 
electrical signals. These signals are then operated on 
to produce cyan, magenta and yellow electrical signals. 
These signals are then transmitted to a thermal 
printer. To obtain the print, a cyan, magenta or 
yellow dye-donor element is placed face-to-face with a 
dye-receiving element. The two are then inserted 
between a thermal printing head and a platen roller. A 
line-type thermal printing head is used to apply heat 
from the back of the dye-donor sheet. The thermal 
printing head has many heating elements and is heated 
up sequentially in response to the cyan, magenta and 
yellow signals. The process is then repeated for the 
other two colors. A color hard copy is thus obtained 
which corresponds to the original picture viewed on a 
screen. Further details of this process and an 
apparatus for carrying it out are contained in U.S. 
Patent No. 4,621,271. A slipping layer is usually provided on the 
backside of the dye-donor element to prevent sticking 
to the thermal head during printing. A subbing layer 
is also usually needed to promote adhesion between the 
support and the slipping layer.  
 U.S. Patent 4,753,921 relates to a polymeric 
subbing layer for a slipping layer of a dye-donor 
element. The slipping layer binders disclosed may be a 
polymer having free hydroxyl groups. However, there is 
no disclosure in that patent that an interlayer 
comprising a polymer having free hydroxyl groups be 
used between the subbing layer and the slipping layer. U.S. Patent No. 4,753,921 discloses the use 
of a titanium alkoxide as a subbing layer between a 
polyester support and a slipping layer. While this 
material is a good subbing layer for adhesion, problems 
have arisen when certain lubricants are used in the 
slipping layer in that these lubricants may reduce the 
adhesion between the slipping layer binder and the 
titanium alkoxide subbing layer. It is an object of 
this invention to be able to use these lubricants in 
the slipping layer while maintaining good
