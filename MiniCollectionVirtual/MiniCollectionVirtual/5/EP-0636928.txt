<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a base film
for a photographic film. More specifically, it relates
to a base film for a photographic film, which has
anti-curling properties, transparency and lubricity and
which is formed of polyethylene-2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylate
as a raw material.A biaxially oriented polyethylene-2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylate
film is excellent in
mechanical properties, thermal properties and electric
properties, and is hence studied for use in various
fields. It has been put to practical use in the fields
of a magnetic recording medium and electric insulation.As one of uses of the above film, it is used
in the field, for example, of photographic
photosensitive materials. These photosensitive
materials are largely classified into films used in the
form of a sheet such as an X-ray film, a film as a
printing plate and a cut film and films used in the
form of a roll typified by a color or black-and-white
negative film having a width of 35 mm or less. This
negative film is encased in a film cartridge and the
cartridge is placed in the holder of a general camera
when used for taking pictures.A biaxially oriented polyester film formed of
polyethylene terephthalate is mainly used as a base for
films in the form of a sheet. Further, a film formed
of a cellulose-based polymer typified by triacetyl
cellulose (to be sometimes referred to as TAC
hereinafter) is used as a base for films in the form of
a roll.A TAC film has its characteristic features in
freedom from optical anisotropy, high transparency and 
the property of removal of curling after developing
treatment, and in particular, the excellence in the
property of removal of curling is said to be a feature
that does not belong to a film of any other material.
Since, however, the production of the TAC film uses an
organic solvent, it is necessary to take care to
recycle the solvent completely for preventing the
environmental pollution. In particular, the issue of
environmental destruction is attracting attention in
recent years, and there is a growing tendency to
decrease or avoid the use of an organic solvent which
may cause an environmental pollution.On the other hand, a polyethylene
terephthalate film is a film that can be formed by a
melt extrusion method without any organic solvent, and
a polyethylene terephthalate film is partly started to
be used as a base film for a photosensitive film for
photography.However, a polyethylene terephthalate film
has a problem in that it undergoes curling (curling
tendency) and that it is difficult to
