<ABSTRACT>
The present pump comprises electronic and mechanical means which permit operation which can be individually regulated. According to the invention, for this purpose means (2, 5, 8) are provided which periodically transform a drive current for an electric drive (1). A controllable clock generator (3) controls the conversion frequency thereof. The pumping volume is determined and limited as desired by means of a position-detecting means (4). According to the invention, the pump also has means (7) for measuring the drive current which cooperate with a controllable current-limiting device (5) in order to regulate and to limit the pumping force of the pump. In a preferred embodiment, the pump comprises a plurality of pump cylinders which are controlled by a position-controlling circuit (8) in such a way that the underpressure generated follows a predetermined temporal variation.
