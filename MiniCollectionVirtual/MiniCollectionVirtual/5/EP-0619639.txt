<ABSTRACT>
An electronically commutated synchronous motor drive is disclosed in the form of a linear actuator or rotation actuator whose actuation element is formed from a permanent magnet, which is mounted such that it can be displaced or can rotate, and whose stator is formed from a winding. It is proposed according to the invention to achieve better synchronism than in the prior art by providing a drive device and a detector device (11-14,20-24), which detector device produces a position signal indicating the respective relative position and angular position respectively of the linear actuator and rotation actuator respectively, and which drive device impresses a current (which is assigned to the detected position) and is sinusoidal or has a plurality of steps in the positive region and negative region, depending on the position signal of the winding (3,3a,3b).
