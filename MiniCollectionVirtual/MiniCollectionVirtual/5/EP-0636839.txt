<ABSTRACT>
A reactor for incinerating and melting materials 
such as waste and/or toxic materials has a containment housing 

(2) inside of which an upright, open-ended drum (10) is 
rotatably mounted. The drum is lined with refractory (54), 

forms a central discharge opening (12) for the removal of 
incinerated and melted materials, and has an upright, outer 

wall (19). Incineration heat is supplied by a plasma torch 
(25) which is mounted to the containment housing and extends 

into the drum. A steel throat ring (40) concentric with the 
discharge opening (12) is connected with the exterior of the 

drum; e.g. an outer drum wall, by grounding arms (50) which 
extend non-radially; e.g. tangentially from a periphery (56) 

of the throat ring to the inside surface (58) of the drum 
wall, so that electric discharge from the torch (25) to the 

upwardly oriented surfaces (92, 94) of the throat ring (40) 
and the grounding arms (50) is possible. The throat ring and 

the grounding arms are otherwise embedded in insulating 
refractory material carried by a rotating base plate (68) of 

the drum which has a radially open, horizontally disposed slit 
(78) that extends radially from a periphery of the base plate 

to the vicinity of the discharge opening. Several cooling 
water nozzles (112) are mounted to the containment housing (2) 

opposite the slit (78) for directing cooling water jets 
radially into the slit. The rotation of the drum generates 

centrifugal forces which aid in the removal of the cooling 
water from the slit.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a reactor for incinerating and
melting a material according to the preamble of claim 1, which
is already known from US-A-5 136 137.The invention seeks improvements in the treatment of variety
of materials, especially waste materials, including those
containing combustibles and critical high performance alloys,
by incineration, pyrolysis and/or melting, in particular to
improvements in the cooling and electrical conduction for such
reactors.The disposal of waste materials, especially of toxic
waste, with plasma torches is well known and has been
performed for some time. In such a process, a plasma torch
transfers electrical energy through a stream of ionized gas so
that the gas becomes an electrical conductor. With such a
torch, very high temperatures of as much as 10,000°C-15,000°C
can be attained.In general, there are two types of plasma torches,
non-transferred arc torches, in which the electric potential
is entirely contained within the torch, and transferred arc
torches, in which an arc is struck between the body of the
torch on the one side of an electrical field and a point or
area spaced therefrom. The present invention is for
use with transferred arc torches.Generally speaking, a plasma torch disposal reactor
raises the temperature of waste materials, including toxic
waste materials, to such high levels that they chemically
break down (pyrolysis). This breakdown can be enhanced by
maintaining an atmosphere of the appropriate gas in the
incinerator. As a result, the residues are usually harmless
gases and solids which can be suitably removed from the
incinerator.In the recent past, significant improvements to such
incinerators or reactors were made. The U.S. 
patent 4,912,296, for example, discloses an advantageous
construction for a plasma torch useable with incinerators of
the type here under consideration. U.S. patent 4,770,109 and
U.S. patent 5,136,137, both by the inventor of this
application, disclose and claim
reactors for the incineration and melting of all types of
materials, particularly hazardous waste, with which the
invention of this application is particularly useful.A reactor, in which the base plate is cooled by the injection
of fluid into a slit therein is revealed in GB-A-1 414 941.The reactor disclosed and claimed in the '137 patent
uses a rotating, material-receiving
drum or chamber into which the hot plasma of a
plasma torch is directed. The inner surface profile of the
rotating drum is appropriately shaped and constructed so that
