<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to diodes such as diodes operating in
the avalanche breakdown region.Any reverse biased PN junction has a small reverse current
flow due to the presence of holes and electrons in the vicinity of
the depletion region. These holes and electrons are swept across
the depletion region by the applied electric field and contribute to
the leakage current of the PN junction. As the reverse bias on the
PN junction is increased, the applied electric field increases and
the carriers acquire increasing amounts of energy. At a
predetermined critical electric field, many of the carriers
traversing the depletion region acquire sufficient energy to create
new hole-electron pairs upon colliding with lattice atoms. This is
called the avalanche multiplication process and leads to a large
and sudden increase in the reverse bias current since the newly
created carriers are also capable of producing new hole-electron
pairs upon colliding with other lattice atoms. It should be noted
that for a large reverse current to flow by avalanche breakdown,
two conditions must exist: first, there must be sufficient reverse
bias potential across the PN junction to create a sufficient
electric field in the depletion region to support avalanche
multiplication which enables holes and electrons to accelerate
across the PN junction and, thus, create many additional carriers.
Second, there must be carriers available in the vicinity of the PN
junction to begin and sustain the avalanche breakdown process.PN junctions operating in the avalanche region, as described
above, are widely used as voltage references and are typically
called zener diodes, but are more correctly called avalanche
breakdown diodes. However, one major problem with zener diodes
is that they exhibit large levels of noise, or short term variations
in the breakdown current, when biased around their breakdown
voltage. One simplistic approach for reducing the noise due to
avalanche breakdown of a PN junction is to place a capacitor 
across the PN junction. In general, as the value of the capacitor increases,
the level of the noise decreases. However, a large capacitor is difficult to
fabricate on an integrated circuit and typically reduces the speed of the
circuit.Another approach for reducing the noise due to avalanche breakdown
of a PN junction is to bias the PN junction at a higher current. However,
this approach consumes a large amount of power while only slightly reducing
the noise.Patent Abstracts of Japan, vol. 7, no. 76 (E-167) and Japanese patent
