<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to explosive charges commonly
employed in freeing deposits from oil and gas wells, and
especially to perforating, explosive charge devices adaptable
to create fissures and holes in oil and gas deposit
substrates.Following drilling operations, oil and gas producers
are often faced with the problem of freeing deposits from the
well hole site. Since many of the easily obtainable energy
sources have already been harvested, a large number of the
remaining sites are trapped within hard rock and sandstone
substrates. Such wells are often abandoned because of an
inability to perforate these down-hole geological formations.
Improved means for enhancing penetration, therefore, would be
expected to result in a significant economic gain in oil and
gas production.The art has previously resorted to shaped explosive
charges for perforating the solid rock to reach these
otherwise inaccessible reserves. These charges have been
known to create fissures in the deposit substrates, whereby
channels are generated between the oil and gas reservoirs and
the well bore. In most of the commercially-available shaped
charges, a metal tube containing a common explosive material, 
such as C6, is provided with an initiating charge containing,
for example, a simple cylindrical pellet booster. A
conically-shaped metal liner is inserted into the front of the
tube and into the explosive material for aiding penetration
into the hard rock formations upon detonation of the charge.
Such liners typically employ a soft ductile, low density
metal, such as copper or iron. The principles of shaped
charge functioning are well known, and are described in G.
Birkhoff et al., Journal of Applied Physics, Vol. 19, p. 563-82
(June, 1948), and M. Cook, The Science of High Explosives,
Chapter 10, Reinhold Publishing Corp., New York (1958), which
are hereby incorporated by reference.The penetration of a shaped charge into a solid hard
rock formation is known to be governed by the following
calculation, hereinafter referred to as the "penetration
formula".
P = l PiPm1/2 X KWhere P = penetration into a given target in units of distancel = the length of the metal jetPi = the density of the jet metal in g/ccPm = the density of the material being penetrated
in g/ccFrom this equation, it is clear that by maximizing
the ratio of the metal jet density, "Pi", to the target
density, "Pm", a greater penetration, "P", into the formation
can successfully be achieved. Additionally, greater ductility
is also important, since it is directly related
