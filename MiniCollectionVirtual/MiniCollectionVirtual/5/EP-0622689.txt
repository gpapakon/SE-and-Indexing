<ABSTRACT>
The toner for electrophotography contains a binder 
resin, wherein the binder resin has a condensation 

polymerization-type resin for forming a matrix and an 
addition polymerization-type resin for forming a dispersed 

domain. The dispersed domain with a cross-sectional 
diameter of not more than 2 µm has an areal proportion of 

not less than 90%, based on the total cross-sectional area 
of the dispersed domain. This toner is stable, which is 

capable of maintaining a suitable tribo electric charge, 
thereby providing a high image quality in which the formed 

images do not undergo deterioration even under severe 
environmental conditions. Moreover, in a fixing method 

using a heat roller, fixing at a low temperature can be 
performed without using an offset inhibiting liquid.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for the production of a toner for
electrophotography which is stable and capable of
maintaining a suitable tribo electric charge, thereby
providing a high image quality so that the formed images do
not undergo deterioration even under severe environmental
conditions.As described in US-A-2,297,691 and US-A-2,357,809
and other publications, the conventional
electrophotography comprises the steps of forming an
electrostatic latent image by evenly charging a
photoconductive insulating layer and subsequently exposing
the layer to eliminate the charge on the exposed portion
and visualizing the formed image by adhering colored
charged fine powder known as a toner to the latent image
(a developing process); transferring the obtained visible
image to an image-receiving sheet such as a transfer paper
(a transfer process); and permanently fixing the
transferred image by heating, pressure application or
other appropriate means of fixing (a fixing process).As stated above, a toner must meet the requirements
not only in the development process but also in the 
transfer process and fixing process.In the above processes, contact heat-fixing methods
such as a heat roller fixing and non-contact heat-fixing
methods such as an oven fixing can be used for the fixing
process. Since the contact method is characterized by
having a good thermal efficiency, the temperature of the
fixing device can be lowered when compared with that of
the non-contact method, thereby making it effective for
energy conservation and miniaturization of the overall
copying machine. However, in this contact heat-fixing
method, the toner is likely to cause a so-called "offset
phenomenon," wherein the toner is adhered to the surface
of the heat roller, and thus transferred to a subsequent
transfer paper. In order to prevent this phenomenon, the
surface of a heat roller may be coated with a material
excellent in release properties, such as a fluororesin, or
a releasing agent such as a silicone oil may be applied on
the surface of a heat roller. However, the method of
applying a silicone oil necessitates a larger-scale fixing
device, which is not only expensive but also complicated,
which in turn may undesirably bring about various
problems.Conventionally, vinyl resins typically represented by
styrene-acrylic copolymer are used for toners for these
systems. When the vinyl resins are used, it is necessary
to increase the softening point and the crosslinking
density of the resins in order to increase the offset

A method for producing a toner for electrophotography comprising
a binder resin, wherein a resin comprising a condensation

polymerization-type resin selected from polyester
resins, polyester-polyamid resins and polyamid

resins for forming a matrix and an addition polymerization-type
vinyl resin for forming a dispersed domain

is used as the binder resin, wherein the dispersed domain
with a cross-sectional diameter of not more than 2 µm has an

areal proportion of not more than 90%, based on the total
cross-sectional area of the dispersed domain, wherein said

binder resin is obtainable by the process comprising the
steps of:


adding a mixture comprising a starting material
monomer for the vinyl resin dropwise to a mixture

comprising starting material monomers for the
polyesters, polyester-polyamides or polyamides

addition polymerization reaction, the condensation

polymerization being partly carried out
concurrently with the addition polymerization

reaction;

and wherein the starting material monomers for polyesters,
polyester-polyamides, and polyamides comprise as
