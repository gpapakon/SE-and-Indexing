<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for generating turbulence in stock to deflocculate the stock in an open surface forming section of a paper making machine comprises a dewatering box (2) providing vacuum assisted drainage and which has a set of dewatering elements that impart turbulence into relatively thick stock layers carried at machine operating speeds of equal up to about 400 m/min, for the production of paper products having a basis weight generally in excess of about 160 gsm. Each set of elements includes a lead-in element (5), at least one intermediate element (6, 7), and a trailing element (8). The path of the forming fabric (13) is deflected downwardly as it passes over the intermediate elements, which are inclined at an angle of from about 0 DEG  to about 10 DEG  from a plane defined by forming fabric supporting surfaces on the lead-in and riser elements. This vertical movement initiates turbulence and agitation in the stock, which acts both to deflocculate the stock and to diminish the possibility of sheet sealing. The apparatus is useable in combination with other known formation and drainage devices which are located either upstream or downstream to augment their performance with thicker, slower moving stock layers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus and method
for generating stock turbulence in the forming section of an
open surface paper making machine. More specifically, the
present invention relates to an apparatus and method for
generating sufficient turbulence in the stock layer of an open
surface forming section of a papermaking machine to assist in
deflocculating a relatively thick stock layer carried on a
relatively slowly moving forming fabric. This invention thus
finds application in the manufacture of relatively heavy paper,
pulp and board products. Further, the apparatus can be
adjustable, so that the amount of turbulence imparted into the
stock layer may be controlled and optimized to suit the grade
of product being made.In a conventional open surface forming section, an aqueous
stock, containing both paper making fibers and other paper
making solids in amounts of from about 0.1% to about 1.5% by
weight, is fed from a headbox slice onto a horizontal moving
forming fabric. In such a forming section, after receiving the
stock from the headbox slice, the moving forming fabric is
supported by a forming board, followed by a series of drainage
boxes. The drainage boxes commonly include dewatering devices
such as blades and foils mounted on the drainage box in contact
with the machine side of the forming fabric. In some modern
slow speed machines table rolls are also still used as
dewatering and turbulence generating devices. The forming
section can also include other devices intended to generate at
least some turbulence within the stock, such as formation 
showers. As the stock on the open surface forming fabric moves
through the forming section, water is removed from the stock
until an incipient paper web is formed which contains from
about 75% to about 85% water. The remainder of the water is
removed in subsequent parts of the papermaking machine.The thickness of the stock layer deposited from the head
box slice onto the forming fabric is determined by the machine
speed, the water content of the stock delivered from the head
box, and the basis weight of the paper or board product being
manufactured. Heavier grade products, such as linerboard,
corrugating medium, market pulp grades, and paperboard
products, require a greater initial stock thickness than
lighter grades, such as newsprint.To provide an acceptable paper product, it is important
that the paper making solids, including the paper making
fibers, be thoroughly mixed and dispersed as randomly as
possible in the stock leaving the headbox
