<ABSTRACT>
A method is provided for making a heat curable 
organopolysiloxane composition, such as a 

pressure sensitive adhesive composition by blending a 
benzene soluble resinous copolymer in the form of a 

spray dried particulate, comprising triorganosiloxy 
units, such as trimethylsiloxy units, and SiO₂ units 

with a fluid network mixture of an alkenyl siloxane, a 
silicon hydride siloxane and a hydrosilylation 

catalyst.

<DESCRIPTION>
Reference is made to copending application 
07/675,380, filed 3-26-91 and copending applications 
08/030,737 and 08/030,740 filed concurrently herewith. The present invention relates to 
solventless platinum catalyzed silicone compositions 
convertible to pressure sensitive adhesives (PSAs) and 
method for making. More particularly, the present 
invention relates to the use of a spray dried silicone 
resin powder having triorganosiloxy units (M) and 
tetrasiloxy units (Q) and a PSA network mixture of a 
substantially linear alkenyl siloxane, a substantially 
linear silicon hydride siloxane and a hydrosilylation 
catalyst. As shown by Hahn et al, U.S. patent 
3,983,398, platinum catalyzed organopolysiloxane 
compositions convertible to PSAs comprising a benzene 
soluble resinous copolymer of triorganosiloxy units 
and tetrasiloxy units have been used in the form of an 
organic solvent solution in combination with a network 
mixture. The network mixture consists of a 
substantially linear alkenyl siloxane or vinyl 
siloxane, a substantially linear silicon hydride 
siloxane and a hydrosilylation catalyst, such as a 
platinum catalyst.  
 Although PSAs can be made utilizing a 
combination of the above-described benzene soluble 
ingredients, prior to the present invention such PSAs 
required the stripping of organic solvent from the 
resinous copolymer while it was in the presence of a 
silicone fluid, such as a vinyl siloxane fluid. In 
most instances, the platinum catalyst also was present 
with the vinyl siloxane fluid during the stripping 
procedure. Stripping of an organic solvent by a heat 
curable silicone fabricator who did not have adequate 
solvent trapping equipment, generated volatiles which 
often resulted in excessive air pollution. The 
benzene soluble resinous copolymer was normally 
available to the fabricator as an organic solvent 
dispersion, because it could not be readily blended in 
bulk form into the network mixture. The term "network 
mixture" hereinafter means one or more of the silicone 
components comprising the mixture of alkenyl siloxane, 
a silicon hydride siloxane and a platinum catalyst. Prior to the present invention, a 
convenient technique was to blend one or more of the 
network ingredients, such as the alkenyl siloxane, 
along with the platinum catalyst into an organic 
solvent dispersion of the benzene soluble copolymer. 
When the organic solvent was stripped, a workable 
silicone blend could be formed which could be 
formulated with additional heat curable silicone 
mixt
