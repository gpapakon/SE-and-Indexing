<ABSTRACT>
The present patent refers to a new constructive methodology 
for carrying out continuous-cycle ovens or the like. According 

to this new methodology, few modular multi-function elements 
(1) are to be realized and developed, such elements being 

easily constructed and mounted, and there is no more the 
necessity of realizing more assemblies and elements performing 

a single function to be produced separately and assembled 
together in various subsequent phases. 
In general, the said modular multi-function elements (1) 
consist of panels (2) which are carried out in an only 

constructive piece comprising a supporting structure (5), 
a thermal insulation (4) and a part (3) of the baking oven 

chamber. 
The supporting structure (5) consists of a plate which is 
arranged on the outer side of the panel and is realized 

with a composite material which has to be sufficiently 
resistant in order to tolerate the junction stress between 

the panels; the thermal insulation (4) consists of a layer 
of a suitable insulating material such as mineral wool while  

 
the inner face (3) consists of a material which is suited 

to the high operative temperatures of the oven and is fit for 
supporting the elements of the heat generating system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present patent refers to modular self-supporting multi-function 
panels which are to be used for carrying out 
industrial ovens, and preferably continuous-cycle ovens, 
or the like. According to the present art, the "oven products" such as 
bread in its different shapes, biscuits, crackers, cakes, 
brioches and snacks are baked in plants which comprise 
in general the following functional assemblies: 
a) a supporting structure or frame which supports and keeps 
all the plant assemblies in position, such supporting structure 
or frame being formed by beams or plates which are connected 
by means of suitable joint systems such as screws, rivets 
and/or soldering seams; b) a baking chamber, heated by a heat generating system, 
the product to be baked being fed in with a moving system; c) a direct or indirect heat generating system for baking 
the product; d) a continuous moving system for the product and its eventual  
 
container; e) auxiliary systems for the vapour extraction, the air 
circulation in the baking chamber, the vaporisation and 
further ones; f) nonconductive materials for preventing the dispersion 
of the heat necessary for the baking process from both the 
heat generating system and the baking chamber; g) covers or cases for safety, protection or aesthetic 
purposes. The laying of such functional assemblies is done by mounting 
the supporting structure or frame, joining the beams or 
plates forming the supporting framework in which the baking 
chamber, the heat generating assembly and the moving system 
for moving the product and its eventual container are then 
inserted or laid and then fixed. Subsequently, the auxiliary systems are inserted, the 
insulation of the assembled parts is accomplished and finally, 
the outer cases are applied. The laying of the oven may be done either by sending all 
the various disassembled parts to the client and assembling 
them on the spot or by carrying out a modular construction 
in the workshop, such modular construction consisting of 
oven sections which can be sent to the client. The assembling  
 
procedure is then accomplished on the spot. However, the above solutions involve some disadvantages 
owing to the presence of an excessive number of designs, 
components, raw materials, manufacturing and mounting phases 
which increase the final cost of the product remarkably 
since there are several partial costs to be summed up in 
the above methodology of design and construction. Moreover, 
the so-obtained construction is uselessly heavy which causes

<CLAIMS>
1) Modular self-supporting multi-function panels for carrying 
out industrial ovens, and preferably industrial continuous-cycle 

ovens, and the like, characterized for being produced 
in an only constructive piece comprising a supporting 

structure, a thermal insulation and a part of the baking 
chamber of the oven. 
2) Multi-function panels as claimed in Claim 1, characterized 
by the fact that the said supporting structure consists 

of an outer plate (5) which is made of a preferably composite, 
rigid material, resisting to stresses, which plate supports 

all the things that are contained, hanged and leaned in 
the baking system. 
3) Multi-function panels as claimed in the foregoing claims, 
characterized by the fact that the said thermal insulation 

consists of an insulating layer (4), made of a suited 
insulating material such as mineral wool or the like. 
4) Multi-function panels as claimed in the foregoing claims, 
characterized by the fact that the said part of the baking 

 
chamber of the oven consists of an inner face (3), made 

of a material suitable for the high operative temperatures 
of the oven and for supporting the elements of the heat 

generating system. 
5) Multi-function panels as claimed in the foregoing claims, 
characterized for being shaped in any form and dimension 

but preferably in a dimension permitting a mudular construction 
of the oven. 
6) Multi-function panels as claimed in the foregoing claims, 
characterized by the fact that the modules, which are obtained 

by joining the panels one with another, may be layed on 
supporting elements (6) and fixed; otherwise, the panels 

may be provided with brackets (7) for laying the oven on 
the floor in order to obtain a perfect levelling of the 

various consecutive modules. 
7) Multi-function panels as claimed in the foregoing claims, 
characterized by the fact that according to a possible variant 

of the said modular structure, the inner faces (3) are removed 
from each panel so that a conventional baking chamber may 

be then inserted in the modular structure itself and secured.
