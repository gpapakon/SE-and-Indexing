<ABSTRACT>
A molecular composite material having excellent 
properties such as mechanical strength, heat resistance, 

solvent resistance, etc. is produced by dissolving a 
prepolymer of a rigid aromatic polymer in a monomer of a 

matrix polymer to form a homogeneous solution and then 
heating the homogeneous solution to cause a ring closure 

reaction of the prepolymer and a polymerization reaction 
of the monomer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
producing a molecular composite material comprising a
rigid aromatic polymer and a matrix polymer, and more
particularly to a method of producing a molecular
composite material having excellent dispersibility,
mechanical strength, etc. substantially without using a
solvent.Recently, to achieve the reduction of weight of
aircraft, automobiles, etc., plastic materials called
"engineering plastics" having excellent mechanical
properties, heat resistance, etc. have been increasingly
used. Apart from this, development has been actively
carried out to provide composite materials such as FRPs
consisting of plastic materials and high-strength, high-modulus
fibers such as carbon fibers, and these
composite materials are being used in many applications.It is known that the strength of these composite
materials largely depends not only on the strength of
plastics and reinforcing fibers but also on the
interfacial bonding strength of the fibers to the matrix
resins. Also, the impregnating capability of matrix
resins into the fiber-reinforced preforms affects the
ease of production of composite materials and the
strength of the resulting products. Accordingly, even
though high-strength, high modulus fibers and resins are
used as starting materials, composite materials having
excellent strength are not necessarily obtained.Under such circumstances, proposals have been made
to develop high-strength polymer blend composites
(molecular composite materials) by finely dispersing
rigid polymers such as aromatic polyamides, etc. in
matrix resins to a molecular level. Aromatic polymers suitable for molecular composite
materials include those containing heterocyclic
repeating units such as thiazole rings, imidazole rings,
oxazole rings, oxazinone rings, etc. Among them,
aromatic polythiazole having a thiazole ring is highly
promising because of its excellent mechanical strength.In the meantime, the homogeneous dispersion of a
reinforcing polymer in a matrix polymer cannot be
achieved if the reinforcing polymer is simply blended
with the matrix polymer. This means that simple blending
fails to provide a molecular composite material having
excellent mechanical properties. Therefore, various
attempts have been made so far.For instance, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 1
287167 discloses a method of producing a polymer
composite comprising the steps of introducing a polymer
solution mainly containing (A) a reinforcing polymer
consisting of polythiazole having a substantially rod-shaped
ske
