<ABSTRACT>
The description relates to ionic polymers obtained by the reaction of carboxyl group-containing fat and oil-based raw materials with salts of polyvalent ions. They are usable as sealants, coatings, adhesives and additives for plastic formulations and for mortars, plasters and cements. The initial mixture can exist in both a one or two-component formulation.

<CLAIMS>
Ionic polymers obtainable simply by linking 
polyvalent metal ions and carboxylic acids by salt 

bridges, characterized in that the carboxylic acids are 
based on fats and oils and have a molecular weight of 

greater than 200 and in that short-chain polybasic acids 
having molecular weights of 
<
200 may also be used in 
quantities of less than 30%. 
Ionic polymers as claimed in claim 1, characterized 
in that the carboxylic acids are 1- to 10-basic 

and preferably 2- to 5-basic. 
Ionic polymers as claimed in at least one of 
claims 1 and 2, characterized by a molecular weight of 

the carboxylic acids of 
>
 400. 
Ionic polymers as claimed in at least one of 
claims 1 to 3, characterized by the metal ions of Ca, 

Mg, Zn, Zr, Fe, Al and Ti with the counterions oxide, 
hydroxide, carbonate and hydrogen carbonate. 
Ionic polymers as claimed in at least one of 
claims 1 to 4, characterized by a metal ion content of 

up to 90% by weight, preferably up to 40% by weight and, 
more preferably, up to 20% by weight of the salt addition. 
A one-component, moisture-curing starting mixture 
for the production of the ionic polymers claimed in 

claims 1 and 2, characterized by a mixture of anhydrides 
and metal salts. 
The production of the ionic polymers claimed in 
at least one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the 

carboxylic acid or anhydride is applied to a substrate 
already containing the polyvalent metal ions. 
The production of the polymers claimed in at 
least one of claims 1 to 5 by curing of the mixture of 

carboxylic acids and metal ions at room temperature 
(20°C ± 15°C).  

 
The use of the ionic polymers claimed in at least 

one of claims 1 to 5 as adhesives, particularly emulsion-based, 
contact, hotmelt and 2-component adhesives 

and as a packaging and roof adhesive. 
The use of the ionic polymers claimed in at least 
one of claims 1 to 5 as a surfacer and sealant. 
The use of the ionic polymers claimed in at least 
one of claims 1 to 5 for coatings. 
The use of the ionic polymers claimed in at least 
one of claims 1 to 5 in the form of dispersions. 
The use of the ionic polymers claimed in at least 
one of claims 1 to 5 as a filler, more particularly as 

a flameproofing agent for plastics.
