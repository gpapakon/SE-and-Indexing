<ABSTRACT>
The encapsulated toner for heat-and-pressure fixing 
which includes a heat-fusible core material containing at 

least a thermoplastic resin and a coloring agent, and a 
shell formed thereon so as to cover the surface of the 

core material is produced by a process having the step of 
carrying out 
in situ
 polymerization using a thermoplastic 
resin as a main component of the shell to form a shell 

having a structure in which a part of the heat-fusible 
core material is incorporated therein, the thermoplastic 

resin having a mechanical loss tangent (tan δ) in the 
range of from 1.0 to 20.0 based on a dynamic 

viscoelasticity, when measured with a sine stress having 
an angular frequency of 25 rad/s at a temperature of from 

80 to 120°C. By using the encapsulated toner, good offset 
resistance can be obtained in the resulting toner even 

when its fixing speed is slow. Also, the core material is 
likely to be released from the encapsulated toner upon 

fixing while retaining good blocking resistance and good 
shocking resistance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an encapsulated toner
for heat-and-pressure fixing used for development of
electrostatic latent images in electrophotography,
electrostatic printing, or electrostatic recording, and to a
method for producing such an encapsulated toner.As described in US-A-2,297,691 and US-A-2,357,809
and other publications, conventional
electrophotography comprises the steps of forming an
electrostatic latent image by evenly charging a
photoconductive insulating layer, subsequently exposing the
layer to eliminate the charge on the exposed portion and
visualizing the formed image by adhering colored charged
fine powder, known as a toner, to the latent image (a
developing process); transferring the obtained visible image
to an image-receiving sheet such as a transfer paper (a
transfer process); and permanently fixing the transferred
image by heating, pressure application or other appropriate
means of fixing (a fixing process).As indicated above, the toner must meet the
requirements not only of the development process, but also 
of the transfer process and the fixing process.Generally, a toner undergoes mechanical frictional
forces due to shear force and impact force during the
mechanical operation in a developer device, and deteriorates
after copying from several thousands to several ten
thousands of sheets. The deterioration of the toner can be
prevented by using a tough resin having such a high
molecular weight that it can withstand the above mechanical
frictional forces. However, this kind of a resin generally
has such a high softening point that the resulting toner
cannot be sufficiently fixed by a non-contact method, such
as oven fixing or radiant fixing with infrared rays, because
of its poor thermal efficiency. Further, when the toner is
fixed by a contact fixing method, such as a
heat-and-pressure fixing method using a heat roller, which
is excellent in thermal efficiency and therefore widely
used, it becomes necessary to raise the temperature of the
heat roller in order to achieve sufficient fixing of the
toner, which brings about such disadvantages as
deterioration of the fixing device, curling of the paper and
an increase in energy consumption. Furthermore, the resin
described above is poor in grindability, thereby remarkably
lowering the production efficiency of the toner.
Accordingly, the binder resin having too high of a degree of
polymerization and also too high of a softening point cannot
be used.Meanwhile, according to the heat-and-pressure fixing 
method using a heat
