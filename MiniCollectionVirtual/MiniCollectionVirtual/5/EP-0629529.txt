<ABSTRACT>
An enclosure (52), adapted to hold an auto ignition 
material (54) in a gas generator that employs solid fuel 

gas generant material to effect inflation of a protective 
bag to cushion a passenger from impact with the structure 

of a vehicle in the event of a crash, is provided. The 
enclosure comprises a retention cup (56) adapted to be 

press fitted into a recess in a gas generator body and 
retained by deformation of integral circumferentially 

spaced ribs (66). The auto ignition material is retained 
by a retention screen (58) of wire mesh or the like, held 

in place by an inwardly bent flange (88).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to gas generators for 
inflating vehicular inflatable restraint cushions, commonly known 
as air or gas bags, to provide impact protection to occupants of 
the vehicle. More particularly, the invention relates to the auto 
ignition of such gas generators. It is well known to protect a vehicle occupant using a cushion 
or bag that is inflated/expanded with gas, e.g., an "air bag", when 
the vehicle encounters sudden deceleration, such as in a collision. 
In such systems, the cushion is normally housed in an uninflated 
and folded condition to minimize space requirements. Upon 
actuation of the inflatable restraint system, the air bag is 
commonly inflated in a matter of a few milliseconds with gas 
produced by the burning of a gas generant material, e.g., a 
pyrotechnic, in a device commonly referred to as "a gas generator" 
or "an inflator." The gas generant is commonly ignited by means of 
an igniter having an ignition agent. The pressure of the 
combustion gases resulting from the rapid burning of the gas 
generant material causes gas to rush into the air bag to effect the 
rapid inflation thereof. The cushion can then serve to restrain 
the movement of the vehicle occupant as the collision proceeds. Inflatable restraint systems have been devised for automotive 
vehicles in which one or more air bags are stored in one or more 
storage compartments within the vehicle. In general, an air bag 
provided for the protection of a vehicle driver, e.g., a driver 
side air bag, is stored within a housing mounted in a storage 
compartment located in the steering column of the vehicle. 
Whereas, an air bag for the protection of a front seat passenger, 
e.g., a passenger side air bag, is typically stored within a  
 
housing mounted in the instrument panel/dash board of the vehicle. In such systems, the gas generators or inflators must be 
constructed to withstand large thermal and mechanical stresses 
during the gas generation process. Thus, gas generators have been 
fabricated using steel for the casing and other structural 
components, with the structural components commonly joined together 
by screw threads, roll crimping or welding. To satisfy light weight specifications, significant weight 
reduction can be achieved through the utilization of a light metal 
or material such as aluminum or an aluminum alloy for the generator 
housing and other structural components. Gas generators made of 
such materials typically will not experience problems in ordinary 
use wherein, during

<CLAIMS>
An enclosure (52) for an auto ignition 
material in an auto ignition device (50) adapted for use in 

a gas generator (10) for a vehicular inflatable restraint 
cushion, said enclosure comprising: 

   a retention cup (56) with an inside (60) adapted for 
holding at least one auto ignition material (54) and an 

outside (62) having at least five spaced ribs (66) adapted 
for press fit insertion and retention of the device within 

a recess said retention cup including an axially extending 
side wall (72), an end wall (78) which extends inwardly 

from a first end (74) of said side wall at least partially 
to close on end of said retention cup, and a bendable 

flange (88) which extends from a second end (76) of said 
side wall opposite from said first end, and 

   a retention screen (58) defining a plurality of 
openings to allow hot gas and particulate from the auto 

ignition material to flow outwardly from said cup, said 
retention screen being securable in the enclosure by means 

of the bendable flange. 
An enclosure according to claim 1 wherein said 
ribs (66) are equally spaced. 
An enclosure according to claim 1 or claim 2 
having six said ribs (66). 
An enclosure according to any preceding claim 
wherein at least one of said ribs (66) comprises a tapered 

lead surface (68). 
An enclosure according to any preceding claim 
wherein said retention screen (58) comprises a metal mesh 

 
screen. 
An enclosure according to any preceding claim 
wherein said retention cup (56) is of one piece 

construction. 
An enclosure according to claim 6 wherein said 
retention cup (56) is formed with progressively punched 

aluminum sheet stock. 
An enclosure according to any preceding claim 
wherein said retention cup (56) has a generally circular 

cross section. 
An enclosure according to claim 8 wherein the 
side wall (72) is cylindrical and has at its second end 

(76) a flared neck transition portion having a first end 
(82) and a second end (84), each having a circular cross 

section with the diameter of the circular cross section of 
the first end (82) being less than that of the second end 

(84), said transition portion extending outwardly from said 
second end of said side wall, and wherein said bendable 

flange (88) is cylindrical with a greater internal diameter 
than said side wall and extends from the second end (84) of 

said transition portion. 
An enclosure according to any preceding claim 
wherein an auto ignition material (54) is enclosed within 

the retention cup (56) and retained by the retention screen

fuel gas generant material (34) to effect inflation of a 

protective bag to cushion a passenger from impact with the 
structure of a vehicle in the event of a crash, which gas 

 
generator includes a tubular housing (12) having an 

elongated chamber therein containing elongated igniter 
means (26) positioned therein with the solid fuel gas 

generant material (34) distributed throughout the length of 
the chamber in surrounding relation to the elongated
