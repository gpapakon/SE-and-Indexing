<ABSTRACT>
Extraction battery fouling is reduced in the solvent 
extraction purification of crude phosphoric acid by performÂ­

ing the steps of:
 

a) extraction crude phosphoric acid with solvent in a 
main extraction battery without the addition of sulfuric acid;

 
b) acidulating the raffinate from step (a) with at least a 

precipitate-forming amount of sulfuric acid;
 

c) aging the precipitate of step (b) for at least 15 
minutes, and separating the precipitate from the acidulated 

raffinate;
 

d) extracting with organic solvent the essentially 
precipitate-free raffinate of step (c) in a secondary extraction 

battery.
