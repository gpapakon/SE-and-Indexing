<ABSTRACT>
The lap (W) to be fed to the combing head (1, 2, 3, 5, 6) is wound off a lap roll (7). The roll (7) has a winding tube (8) on which the lap is wound. The device has supports (10, 12) to hold the roll (7) rotatably in such a way that its axis is parallel to a drive roller (9) and its periphery contacts the drive roller (9). During unwinding the drive roller (9) and at least one component of the supports (10, 12) are mutually movable in relation to the strip (W) in such a way that, despite the gradual reduction in the weight of the roll (7) and as a function of this reduction, the contact force between the roll (7) and the drive roller (9) is compensated. Owing to the compensated contact force, the periphery of the roll (7) always bears against the contact point with approximately the same force. This prevents the quantity of lap wound off the roll (7) per revolution of the drive roller (9) from becoming gradually smaller during the unwinding process.

A device for feeding a lap from a lap roll, for 
the building of which the lap is wound up on a 

winding tube, to a combing head of the combing 
machine, with at least one rotatable drive roller 

(9; 19; 29; 39; 49) and with supporting means (10, 
11; 20; 30; 40, 41; 50) for the rotatable holding 

of the lap roll (7; 17; 27; 37; 47) with an axle 
parallel to the axle of the drive roller in such a 

way that the circumference of the lap roll is in 
contact with the circumference of the drive roller 

(9; 19; 29; 39; 49) during the unwinding of the 
lap (W), characterized in that the drive roller 

(9; 19; 29; 39; 49) and at least one element (10, 
11; 20; 30; 40, 41; 50) of the supporting means 

are movable with respect to one another during the 
unwinding of the lap (W) in the sense that during 

the decrease of the diameter and the weight of the 
lap roll (7; 17; 27; 37; 47) there is achieved an 

evening of the contact force between the lap roll 
and the drive roller despite said reduction in 

weight. 
A device as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that the supporting means comprise at least one 

element (10, 11; 20; 30; 50) which is 
introduceable into the interior of the winding 

tube (8) in order to bear at least a part of the 
weight of the lap roll (7; 17; 27; 47). 
A device as claimed in claim 2, characterized in 
that the supporting means comprise two coaxial 

support pegs (10, 11; 20; 30; 50) which are 
insertable into the ends of the winding tube (8) 

in order to bear at least a part of the weight of 
the lap roll (7; 17; 27; 47).  

 
A device as claimed in claim 3, characterized in 
that the two coaxial support pegs (10, 11; 20; 30; 

50) are held rotatably on elements (12, 13; 22; 
32; 52) which with respect to the drive roller (9; 

19; 29; 49) are movable in vertical directions to 
the axle of the same in order to keep the 

circumference of the lap roll (7; 17; 27; 47) in 
contact with the circumference of the drive roller 

(9; 19; 29; 49) during the unwinding of the lap 
(W). 
A device as claimed in claim 4, characterized in 
that the elements (12, 13; 22; 32; 52) on which 

the support pegs (10, 11; 20; 30; 50) are held are 
movably guided and/or are force-loaded in such a 

way that during the unwinding of the lap (W), with 
the diameter of the lap roll (7; 17; 27; 47) 

decreasing and the weight of the lap roll being 
reduced from 100 % to less than 25 %, the force 

with which the circumference of the lap roll is 
pressed against the circumference of the drive 

roller (9; 19; 29; 49) changes by less than +/- 20 
%, preferably less than +/- 10 %. 
A device as claimed in claim 4 or 5, characterized 
in that the elements on which the support pegs 

(10, 11; 20; 30) are held are arms (12, 13; 22) 
which are swivellable about an axle (A) fixed on 

the frame. 
A device as claimed in one of the claims 3 to 6, 
characterized in that the support pegs (10, 11; 

20; 30; 50) are axially movable with respect to 
one another for their insertion into the ends of 

the winding tube (8) and for their retraction from 
said ends.  

 
A device as claimed in claim 7, characterized in 
that the support pegs (10, 11; 20; 30; 50) are 

conical. 
A device as claimed in claim 7 or 8, characterized 
by at least one bearing element (15) which is 

arranged at a distance from the drive roller (9; 
19; 29) in such a way that a full lap roll (7; 17; 

27) can be placed on the drive roller (9; 19; 29) 
and the bearing element (15) before the support 

pegs (10, 11; 20; 30) are inserted into the ends 
of the winding tube (8). 
A device as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that the support means comprise two bearing 

rollers (40, 41) for the lap roll (37) which are 
parallel to the drive roller (39) and that the 

drive roller (39) is movable with respect to the 
bearing rollers (40, 41) vertically to the axles 

thereof and is force-loaded for contact on the 
circumference of the lap roll (37).
