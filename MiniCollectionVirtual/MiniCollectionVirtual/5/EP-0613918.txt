<ABSTRACT>
A process for preparing polyamides involves the 
activated anionic polymerization of lactams in the presence 

of catalysts, activators, and, optionally, further 
copolymerizable components using cyclic trimers of 

polyisocyanates as activators. The advantage of such cyclic 
trimers of polyisocyanates is that they are liquid at room 

temperature, which makes it easy to meter them. In addition, 
these substances have a low vapour pressure, while they are 

good activators for the catalysts used in polyamide 
preparation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
preparing polyamides by conducting the activated anionic 
polymerization of at least one lactam in the presence of 
catalysts, a cyclic trimer of polyisocyanate as an activator 
and, optionally, other copolymerizable components. According to the patent literature, polyamides can 
be prepared by the anionically activated polymerization of 
lactams in the presence of catalysts and activators and, 
optionally, other copolymerizable components wherein biuret 
polyisocyanates based on non-aromatic diisocyanates in 
admixture with 0 to 70 parts by weight N-alkyl lactams (per 
100 parts by weight biuret polyisocyanate), and having 
dynamic viscosities of at most 12,000 mPa.s are used as 
activators. Such a process is described in EP-B-167907. The aforementioned process, however, suffers from a 
severely limiting environmental and health problem. 
Polyisocyanates that contain biuret groups and that are based 
on non-aromatic diisocyanates decompose into volatile 
isocyanates. The isocyanate decomposition products are toxic 
and pose undesired health and environmental risks. It would 
be a significant advance in the art to provide an anionically 
catalyzed polymerization process for lactams which avoids, or 
at least significantly reduces, release of toxic isocyanate 
decomposition products.  The present inventors have discovered that the 
drawbacks characterizing the prior art process can be 
eliminated by using cyclic trimers of polyisocyanates as the 
activators in the polymerization of lactams to polyamides. The present processes pertain to the activated 
anionic polymerization of lactams in the presence of at least 
one cyclic trimer of polyisocyanate as the activator. The 
method is conducted in the presence of catalysts, and, if 
desired, further copolymerizable components. In general, in the present process, the activator 
consists essentially of cyclic trimers of polyisocyanates 
having at least two isocyanate groups and 4 to 25 carbon 
atoms. Among the cyclic trimers of aliphatic diisocyanates, 
diisocyanates such as 1,4-butane diisocyanate, 1,5-hexane 
diisocyanate and 1,6-hexane diisocyanate are preferred. Of 
these, the cyclic trimer of 1,6-hexane diisocyanate is a 
preferred activator. Cyclic trimers of aralphatic, 
cycloaliphatic and aromatic isocyanates can also be used and 
include, for instance, cyclic trimers of isophorone 
diisocyanate, 2,4- and 2,6-toluene diisocyanate, 2,2-, 2,4-and 
4,4-diphenyl methane diisocyanate (MDI). Mixtures of 
polyiso
