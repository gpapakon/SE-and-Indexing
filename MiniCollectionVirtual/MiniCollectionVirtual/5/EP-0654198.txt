<ABSTRACT>
In a method of processing 16:9 pictures for display on a screen with a 4:3 aspect ratio, each line of the television signal is compressed and/or expanded so that the ratio of the length of a segment of unprocessed signal to the length of the resultant signal derived from it, varies along the line. Preferably, each line is subject to "cylindrical" processing such that it is compressed as though the line were extended along an arc of a circle (40) and projected along a direction (42) onto a flat plane (44) joining the ends of the arc. The picture may also be subject to slight vertical stretching to give a final image which is subject to distortion at an acceptable level whilst retaining a good level of vertical detail.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD OF SHOWING 16:9 PICTURES ON 4:3 DISPLAYSThe present invention relates to a method of processing a television signal representing a plurality of lines which when displayed sequentially form an image.At the present time, there is considerable interest in the adoption of an aspect ratio of 16:9 for television pictures, instead of the existing ratio of 4:3. One particular problem in adopting this new aspect ratio is that it will probably be necessary initially to transmit the 16:9 pictures in a manner compatible with receivers having a 4:3 display so that the same signal gives acceptable pictures on receivers both with 4:3 displays and with 16:9 displays.One method of overcoming this problem involves presenting the pictures on a 4:3 display in a "full letterbox" format as illustrated in Figure 1. With this format, the number of active scanning lines containing picture information is 432 lines rather than the normal 576 lines for a 625-line scanning standard. The main objection to this full letterbox format is the presence of broad black borders at the top and the bottom of the 4:3 display. There is the further disadvantage that vertical detail is lost when the number of active picture lines is reduced.Another method is to allow the 16:9 picture to fill the whole of the 4:3 display, with no black borders, in which case the picture detail will be stretched vertically by 25%, i.e., people would become tall and thin. This method has the advantage that no vertical detail is lost and it would therefore be sensible to use it in studios where the scan height of 4:3 displays could be adjusted if desired to give the correct geometry. For broadcasting to existing domestic receivers, a 25% vertical stretch would be too noticeable to be acceptable; however, the use of a small amount of vertical stretch could provide a useful compromise between the disadvantages of the full letterbox and full-height formats. 

 The method of the invention is characterised in that each line signal is compressed and/or expanded so that the ratio of the length of a segment of the unprocessed signal to the length of the segment of the resultant signal derived from it varies along each line.In a preferred embodiment, the signal representing each line is compressed more adjacent the ends of each line than it is in the middle of the line, each line signal being compressed as though the line were disposed along an arc of a circle and projected onto the chord joining the ends of that arc along a direction perpendicular to that notional

CLAIMS
1. A method of processing a television picture signal comprising signals representing a plurality of lines which when displayed sequentially form an image, the method being characterised in that each line signal is compressed and/or expanded so that the ratio of the length of a segment of the unprocessed signal to the length of the segment of the resultant signal derived from it, varies along each line.
2. A method according to claim 1 for processing a television picture signal for display on a display device, the display device having an aspect ratio lower than that of the image formed by the sequential display of the unprocessed signal lines, in which each line signal is compressed so that the ratio of a segment of the compressed signal to the segment of the uncompressed signal from which it is derived varies along each line.
3. A method according to claim 2 in which the signal representing each line is compressed more adjacent the ends of each line than it is in the middle of the line.
4. A method according to claim 3 in which each line signal is compressed as though the line were disposed along an arc of a circle and projected onto the chord joining the ends of that arc along a direction perpendicular to that notional chord, the overall compression ratio of the line being given by sin (α)/α where 2α is the angle in radians subtended by the notional chord at the centre of a notional circle of which said arc is a part.
5. A method according to any preceding claim in which the first aspect ratio is 16:9 and the second aspect ratio at which the signal is to be displayed is 4:3. 


6. A method according to any of claims 1 to 5 in which the signal is further modified to change the number of lines which when displayed sequentially form the image.
7. A method according to claim 6 in which the number of lines is increased by interpolation or repetition.
