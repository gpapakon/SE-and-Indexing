<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to coated acicular 
fine particulate materials, processes for preparing the 
materials, and magnetic coating compositions and magnetic 
recording media containing the material. At present, magnetic recording media are commercially 
available which have various magnetic characteristics. Higher 
recording densities are the properties required of magnetic 
media of the next generation. Magnetic powders of higher 
coercive force are required to fulfill this requirement. The 
coercive force of magnetic powders is dependent largely on 
magnetic shape anisotropy attributable to the shape and 
magnetic crystalline anisotropy attributable to the magnetic 
energy. The present invention relates to a method of giving an 
improved coercive force by enhanced shape anisotropy. More 
particularly, the invention relates to a method of obtaining a 
high coercive force by using fine particles having a great 
axial ratio and utilizing the shape thereof for preparing a 
magnetic powder which is excellent in acicular properties. Fine particles having an increased axial ratio 
generally deform and sinter under a thermal load during 
preparation, encountering difficulty in achieving the  
 
contemplated purpose. Conventionally, fine particles are coated with 
aluminum, silica or like sintering preventing agent and are 
thereby prevented from deforming or sintering (e.g., U.S. 
Patent No. 4,956,220). However, particulate materials, when in 
the form of fine particles, are liable to sinter during 
reaction and therefore require a large amount of sintering 
preventing agent, which increases the amount of nonmagnetic 
component and hampers the reduction reaction to result in the 
drawback of impaired magnetic characteristics. An object of the present invention is to provide an 
acicular fine particulate material which is prepared by a 
promoted reduction reaction while being effectively prevented 
from sintering and which consequently affords magnetic 
recording media having a high recording density, and to 
provide a process for preparing the particulate material, and 
magnetic coating compositions and magnetic recording media 
containing the material. The present invention provides an acicular fine 
particulate material which is coated with a compound 
containing at least one element selected from among elements 
of Groups  and  of the Periodic Table in Periods 5 and 6, 
the acicular fine particulate material being one of () an
