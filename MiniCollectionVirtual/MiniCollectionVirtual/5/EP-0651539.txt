<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a system for contactless 
information transfer. 

The information transfer from a reading device to an 
information carrier takes place by means of the phase shift 

keying (PSK) technique. According to the invention, the at 
least one coil of the information carriers is connected to a 

phase demodulator comprising a phase-locked loop including a 
voltage-controlled oscillator. The output signal of the 

voltage-controlled oscillator is applied to a phase device 
which forms from the output signal a predetermined number of 

phase reference signals having a different predetermined phase 
relative to the output signal. The predetermined phases 

correspond with the possible phase jumps in the signal applied 
to the phase demodulator. Selection means are provided which 

select one of the phase reference signals and apply same, via 
a circuit with a relatively large time constant, to the input 

of the voltage-controlled oscillator for forming a phase-stable 
reference signal for the demodulation of the phase-coded 

data signal coming from the at least one coil.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a system for the purpose of signal 
transmission in contactlessly operating electronic information 
cariers, such as identification cards or chip cards. These cards 
contain one or more electronic chips and can be used to replace 
the known bank cards or credit cards, while being capable of 
providing greater safety in protecting the information. According to standard ISO 10536 (in preparation), drafted by 
the International Standardisation Organisation, the information 
transfer from the card reader to the card can take place via two 
small coils in the card which cooperate with two small coils in 
the card reader. The coils are typically flat coils arranged next 
to each other. In order to enable the card, which contains an 
electronic chip, to be provided with supply energy in a simple 
manner as well, a signal is applied to each of these small coils, 
the signals having a relative phase difference of 90°. After 
double-sided rectification and parallel switching, a DC voltage 
is obtained which is never zero volts. As a consequence, a very 
small smoothing capacitor will suffice, which can be arranged on 
the electronic chip. In the above-described system, data transmission takes place 
through phase modulation, whereby the phase difference between 
the signals on the two coils is switched from +90° to -90° and 
vice versa, one situation representing a logic "1" and the other 
situation representing a logic "0". The use of two small coils in the card entails limitations in 
that the card has to be accurately oriented relative to the 
corresponding coils in the card reader and in that only a rather 
small reading distance is possible. Accordingly, it would be 
advantageous if the cards could operate with one coil rather than 
two. In that case, however, it is desirable that the same 
modulation technique for the data transfer between the card  
 
reader and the card can be used as in the case of cards with two 
coils. The advantage of using a single coil is that the 
orientation of the card relative to the card reader is less 
critical and further that a more substantial reading distance is 
possible. A known modulation technique which is suitable for 
transmitting information via one channel is the frequency 
modulation technique, also referred to as FM or FSK (Frequency 
Shift Keying). Demodulation then takes place mostly via a so-called 
phase loop, where a phase comparator controls a voltage-controlled 
oscillator until the oscillator runs synchronously 
with the carrier
