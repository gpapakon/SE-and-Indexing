<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
producing a support for planographic printing plate and more
particularly relates to a method of producing an aluminum
support which is superior in an electrolytically graining
property.As an aluminum support for printing plate,
particularly for offset printing plate there is used an
aluminum plate (including aluminum alloy plate).In general, an aluminum plate to be used as a support
for offset printing plate needs to have a proper adhesion to
a photographic light-sensitive material and a proper water
retention.The surface of the aluminum plate should be uniformly
and finely grained to meet the aforesaid requirements. This
graining process largely affects a printing performance and a
durability of the printing plate upon the printing process
following manufacture of the plate. Thus, it is important
for the manufacture of the plate whether such graining is
satisfactory or not.In general, an alternating current electrolytic
graining method is used as the method of graining an aluminum
support for a printing plate. There are a variety of 
suitable alternating currents, for example, a normal
alternating waveform such as a sinewaveform, a special
alternating waveform such as a squarewaveform, and the like.
When the aluminum support is grained by alternating current
supplied between the aluminum plate and an opposite electrode
such as a graphite electrode, this graining is usually
conducted only one time, as the result of which, the depth of
pits formed by the graining is small over the whole surface
thereof. Also, the durability of the grained printing plate
during printing will deteriorate. Therefore, in order to
obtain a uniformly and closely grained aluminum plate
satisfying the requirement of a printing plate with deep pits
as compared with their diameters, a variety of methods have
been proposed as follows.One method is a graining method to use a current of
particular waveform for an electrolytic power source (JP-A-53-67507).
(The term "JP-A" as used herein means an
"unexamined published Japanese patent application".) Another
method is to control a ratio between an electricity quantity
of a positive period and that of a negative period at the
time of alternating electrolytic graining (JP-A-54-65607).
Still another method is to control the waveform supplied from
an electrolytic power source (JP-A-55-25381). Finally,
another method is directed to a combination of current
density (JP-A-56-29699). Further, known is a graining method using a
combination of an AC
