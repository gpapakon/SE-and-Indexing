<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the preparation of hydroxyl-containing compounds which are suitable for the polyisocyanate polyaddition process from polyurethane-polyurea and/or polyurea waste by alcoholytic decomposition of these plastics followed by further reaction of the alcoholysis products in order to reduce their content of low-molecular-weight, sterically unhindered, aromatic amines.

Process for the preparation of hydroxyl group-containing
compounds suitable for the polyisocyanate

polyaddition process from polyurethane polyurea wastes
and/or polyurea wastes, characterised in that


I. in a first stage polyurea wastes and/or
polyurethane polyurea wastes are reacted with low

molecular weight diols and/or polyols having
molecular weights of 
<
350 and optionally higher
molecular weight polyols having molecular weights

of 350 to 4000 at temperatures of from 160 to 260,
and
II. in a second stage the amine-containing products of
alcoholysis obtained in the first stage are either


A) reacted further, with stirring, at temperatures
of from 50 to 180째C, however below the

alcoholysis temperature of the first stage, or
B) are reacted with dialkyl dicarbonates and/or
1,3-dicarbonyl compounds.
Process according to Claim 1, characterised in that in
the second stage A) stirring takes place for a period

of from 2 to 24 hours.
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that the temperature in the second stage A) is from 120

to 160째C.
Process according to Claim 1, characterised in that in
the second stage B) from 0.3 to 5 equivalents of 

dialkyl dicarbonate and/or 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds are
used per equivalent of amine.
Process according to Claim 1 or 4, characterised in
that the reaction in the second stage with dialkyl

dicarbonates is carried out at from 0 to 100째C.
Process according to any one of Claims 1, 4 and 5,
characterised in that the reaction in the second stage

takes place with dimethyl dicarbonate and/or diethyl
dicarbonate.
Process according to Claim 1 or 4, characterised in
that the reaction in the second stage takes place with

1,3-dicarbonyl compounds at a temperature of from 40 to
160째C.
Process according to any one of Claims 1, 4 and 7,
characterised in that the reaction in the second stage

with 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds takes place in the
presence of catalytic quantities of proton acids.
Process according to any one of Claims 1, 4, 7 and 8,
characterised in that esterification products of

acetoacetic acid with C
1
 to C
6
-mono- and/or diols are
used as 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds.
Use of the hydroxyl group-containing compounds prepared
according to any one of Claims 1 to 9 for the

polyisocyanate polyaddition process.
