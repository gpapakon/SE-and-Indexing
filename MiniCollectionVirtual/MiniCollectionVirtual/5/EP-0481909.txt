<ABSTRACT>
Base consisting in a leno fabric, with flexible 
strips incorporated into it longitudinally, in the direction 

of the warp, linked successively through each one of 
the weft courses, in such a way that the threads (2) of 

same evolve by passing from the face to the back of the 
fabric, and successively, with respect to adjacent strips 

(1), in accordance with a taffeta texture. The flexible 
strips (1) are arranged in groups of two or more, 

regularly or irregularly spaced apart from each other and 
with respect to the connecting warp threads (3,4), defining 

open bands (5) for the passage of air and light.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to improvements introduced 
in fabrics used for attenuation of light, both at 
domestic level (curtains, drapes) and, most especially, 
those used in agriculture, such as sunshades, hothouses 
and similar. A fabric for this kind of applications must display 
some important features: on one hand, provide for a 
good dispersion of the external light, and specially of 
the infrared radiation coming from an internal heat 
source, and on the other hand allow a satisfactory ventilation 
of the environment, to prevent condensation. This type of fabrics, particularly with respect 
to their industrial application, have so far been constituted 
by sets which include a series of successive and 
parallel pile-warps distributed throughout the length of 
the fabric and linked to each other, between two of which, 
whether across the entire width of the fabric or alternating 
regularly or irregularly with open spaces, the spaces 
left by said pile-warps are covered by means of inclusion, 
also in longitudinal direction, of flexible strips of appropriate 
materials which prevent, regulate or attenuate 
as desired the passage of light. Fabrics of these types are described in Spanish 
Utility Models Nos. 284.531 and U8601630 (Swenson), in 
which the flexible strips are linked between the pile-warps 
on making the fabric itself. Nevertheless, for the inclusion of said flexible 
strips, each of them must of necessity always be included  
 
between two parallel pile-warps, in such a way that the 
aeration spaces are always achieved by leaving free longitudinal 
zones also between pairs of pile-warps, either 
in one, two or more longitudinal bands. From the previous description it follows that 
known fabrics present some important drawbacks, for instance 
the fact that the fabric results necessarily very 
close-woven, thus hindering ventilation; or that, being 
the flexible strips completely flat, they don't favour 
good dispersion of the external light and of the internal 
infrared radiation. Known fabrics present a further drawback in 
their low versatility, due to the fact that they don't allow 
the inclusion of several flexible strip between two 
pile-warps. As can be understood, the results cannot always 
be as ideal as might be wished and, therefore, fabrics so 
formed do not comply with all the minimum application and 
utilization conditions. The strips to be used for a good reflexion of 
the light and of the infrared radiation, must be formed of 
a mirror-like material; for this reason the

<CLAIMS>
Improvements in fabrics for curtains, sunshades 
and similar applications, in which the base is 

formed by a leno fabric, with flexible strips incorporated 
into it longitudinally, in the direction of the warp, 

characterized in that all the flexible strips (1) are 
linked successively through each one of the weft courses, 

in such a way that the threads (2) of same evolve by passing 
from the face to the back 
of the fabric, and successively, 
with respect to adjacent strips (1), in accordance 

with a taffeta texture. 
Improvements in fabrics for curtains, sunshades 
and similar applications, as claimed in claim 1,characterized in that the flexible strips (1) are arranged 

in groups of two or more, alternating with the connecting 
warp threads (3,4), said strips resulting spaced apart 

from one another and with respect to the courses of connecting 
warp threads, forming open bands (5) for the passage 

of air and light. 
Improvements in fabrics for curtains, sunshades 
and similar applications, as claimed in claims 1 

and 2, characterized in that the spaces left between the 
various courses of the connection warp threads (3,4) are 

of the same width, groups of two or more strips (1), 
separated from each other, being arranged in said spaces. 
Improvements in fabrics for curtains, sunshades 
and similar applications, as claimed in claims 1 

and 2, characterized in that the distances between the 
various courses of connecting warp threads (3,4) are different 

from each other, whether regularly or irregularly, 
groups of flexible strips (1) in variable number being arranged 

between the connecting warp threads, said strips 
being separated from each other, in accordance with the 

 
area defined. 
Improvements in fabrics for curtains, sunshades 
and similar applications, as claimed in claims 1 to 

4, characterized in that there is envisaged arrangement, 
in predetermined zones of the fabric, of several adjacent 

courses of connecting warp threads (3,4), for reinforcement 
of the fabric and variation of aeration and shade in 

said zones.
