<ABSTRACT>
A soldering method wherein, even when, for example, a pressure sensor unit having a sensor chip incorporating 
therein a highly integrated type semiconductor circuit is jointed to a metal stem, fluxless soldering can be 

performed without damaging the surface of the sensor chip. For this purpose, in forming a nickel layer for 
jointing by soldering and an oxidation preventing layer of a nickel layer on the surface of a member to be 

jointed, this oxidation preventing layer is formed before the soldering to a film thickness for suppressing 
exposure of nickel of the above-described nickel layer to the outermost surface of the member to be jointed 

after a thermal histeresis in association with the thermal histeresis to be received by the member to be 
jointed, the oxidation preventing layer is heated in a reducing atmosphere to melt a soldering foil and 

jointed to another member to be jointed by soldering. With this arrangement, even if the member to be 
jointed is subjected to the thermal histeresis before the soldering, exposure of the nickel layer, which is a 

base ground, to the outermost surface of the member to be jointed can be effectively suppressed, whereby 
substantially, there is no lowered soldering wettability on the jointed surface of the member to be jointed, 

even if the load imposed on the jointed portion is not increased during the jointing by soldering, satisfactory 
soldering wettability on the jointed surface can be realized, and, since the jointing by soldering is effected 

by heating in a reducing atmosphere, a fluxless soldering is possible that can provide highly tightly sealed 
jointed portion. Therefore, in jointing the pressure sensor unit having the sensor chip incorporating therein 

the highly integrated type semiconductor circuit to the metal stem, there is no need of loading the metal stem 
with the sensor chip facing downward, so that a disadvantage of damaging 

the surface of the sensor chip can be obviated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fluxless 
soldering process adapted to be used where minute mating 
portions are required to be soldered together with a high 
degree of gastightness without using a flux as encountered in 
a pressure sensor unit. As an example, a pressure sensor unit has a joint 
portion to be soldered, and this joint portion measures only 
about 0.5 mm. In addition, a high degree of gastightness 
such as a leakage of less than 1 · 10-12 Pa m3/s 
(1 × 10-11 atm · cc/s) is 
required. In the past, therefore, in order to secure 
sufficient solder-wettability, a flux has been applied to the 
soldered joint surface. However, when a flux is applied and heated, gases 
are given off from the flux, creating voids in the joint 
portion. These remaining voids are a main cause of 
insufficient gastightness in the soldered joint portion. 
Accordingly, where the joint portion is very small, it is 
difficult to improve the gastightness in the joint portion. 
Furthermore, it is necessary to wash away flux residues after 
soldering. This increases the number of the soldering steps. 
Also, the use of a detergent made from a Freon is not  
 
desirable for protection of environment. Accordingly, an improved fluxless soldering method 
has been proposed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 
218950/1991. In particular, two members to be bonded 
together are spaced from each other vertically. The balance 
between the solder-wettabilities of the bonded members is 
improved by making use of both a load and the weight of the 
solder itself which acts to push the solder and cause it to 
flow. However, where a glass substrate used in a pressure 
sensor having a sensor chip on which a semiconductor circuit 
of a large scale integration is integrally formed is bonded 
to a metal stem by this method, the surface of the sensor 
chip extends in such a direction that the chip makes contact 
with a jig during assembly, thus scratching the surface of 
the sensor chip. This deteriorates the electrical 
characteristics.  
 Document DE-A-30 40 493 discloses a fluxless solder process 
of soldering of a glass holder to the surface of an Ni-Fe-alloy 
holder. The glass surface of the glass holder is 
coated with a thin chromium layer in order to achieve adherence 
of a subsequent nickel coating. In order to prevent 
oxidation of the nickel layer during soldering, a further 
gold layer is applied. The Au layer has a thickness of 
about 120-400 nm and serves to suppress movement of Ni 
atoms in the Ni layer to the surface. The coated
