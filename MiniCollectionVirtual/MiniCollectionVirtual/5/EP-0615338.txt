<ABSTRACT>
The present invention discloses a NS-GT cut quartz resonator (4) which has an 
extremely excellent frequency-to-temperature characteristic by changing the coupling 

condition of the resonator using weights (5,6) deposited on at least one end of said 
resonator. The manufacture of the resonator includes a step of adjusting the normalized 

frequency according to the relationship between the normalized frequency and the first 
order temperature coefficient to adjust the first order temperature coefficient to 

substantially zero.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a coupling quartz resonator, particularly, of a GT
cut quartz resonator consisting of a vibrational portion and two supporting portions
(hereinafter referred to as "NS-GT cut resonator") and a method of adjusting the
frequency of a NS-GT cut resonator. In particular, the present invention relates to an
adjustment method for obtaining a GT cut quartz resonator that has a remarkably
excellent frequency-to-temperature characteristic (hereinafter simply referred to as
"temperature characteristic").Recently, photolithographic processes using IC technology have been applied to
resonator manufacture which results in the production of a resonator which is remarkably
downsized. For example, when such a method is applied to the NS-GT cut resonator it
is capable of making its thickness considerably reduced to enable the resonator to be
remarkably downsized yet have an excellent temperature characteristic.Two vibration modes are utilized for the NS-GT cut resonator. That is to say,
the coupling of a primary vibration and a subvibration. The temperature characteristic
is determined by the difference in resonant frequency between the primary vibration and
the subvibration and the intensity of the respective vibrations. In particular, if the ratio
of the vibration intensity between the primary vibration and subvibration is different, the
coupled resonant frequency therebetween is also made different. In order to obtain a
good temperature characteristic then one must match the difference in the resonant
frequency with each of the resonators.For that reason, it takes a long time to adjust the resonant frequency, which is a
factor in the increase of the costs. Moreover, this system is unsuited for mass
production, which is one of the reasons why resonators of this type are not much used. As described above, there has remained this problem that a NS-GT cut resonator
which has a remarkably excellent temperature characteristic cannot be obtained in a short
time and also with ease. In other words, this means that an inexpensive resonator cannot
be obtained. In an article by O. Ochiai et al.: "A Method of Adjusting Resonant
Frequency and Frequency-Temperature Coefficients of Minaturized GT Cut Resonators"
(36th Annual Frequency Control Symposium - 1982, 2-4 June 1982, Philadelphia (US),
p.90-96), there is a disclosed a method of adjusting frequency temperature coefficients
and the resonant frequency of the principle vibration of a GT type resonator by the
addition or elimination of weights.The
