<ABSTRACT>
To produce a roller body (1), of epoxy or phenol resin, at least one pressing tool (2) is applied to the workpiece before it has hardened and removed from the spindle, to give an out-of-round shape. When the material has set, it retains the out-of-round shape.

A method for the production of a roller body (1)
from epoxide or phenol resin, in which a strip impregnated

with the epoxide or phenol resin and containing
fibres is wound onto a mandrel and is subsequently

removed from the mandrel and consolidated, characterized
in that, before consolidation and removal from the

mandrel, the roller body (1) of cylindrical shape is
converted into a non-circular cross-sectional shape by

means of at least one pressing tool (2) acting in a
radially directed manner on a portion of the outer

circumference of the cylindrical region of the roller
body (1) and is set permanently in the non-circular

cross-sectional shape as a result of the subsequent
curing of the material forming it.
A method according to claim 1, characterized in
that the roller body is heated in order to cure the

material forming it.
A method according to claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that the roller body (1) is provided by means of the

pressing tool (2) with a non-circular cross-sectional
shape having at least one circumferential face (4) of

plane design.
