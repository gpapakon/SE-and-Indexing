<ABSTRACT>
A pharmaceutical preparation controlled to release 
a medicinal compound at a targeted site in the 

intestinal tract comprises a medicinal compound-containing 
phase and an enteric coating phase provided 

around the medicinal compound-containing phase, said 
medicinal compound-containing phase releasing the 

medicinal compound quickly after a predetermined 
lag-time after the dissolution of the enteric coating 

phase. The pharmaceutical preparation makes it possible 
for the medicinal compound to be quickly released at any 

targeted site in the small intestine or the large 
intestine by the control of the amount of the enteric 

coating phase and the lag-time before the medicinal 
compound-containing phase starts to release the 

medicinal compound.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a new 
pharmaceutical preparation controlled to release a 
medicinal compound at a targeted site in the intestinal 
tract, and more particularly to a pharmaceutical 
preparation from which a medicinal compound can be 
released selectively at a targeted site such as the 
large intestine by the control of the starting time of 
release of the medicinal compound. Selective delivery of a medicinal compound to the 
large intestine is desired in some recent drug 
therapies, for instance, a local therapy for 
inflammatory disease in the large intestine such as 
ulcerative colitis, or an oral administrative therapy 
with a medicinal compound of a peptide which is easily 
decomposed chemically or enzymatically in the stomach or 
small intestine. In order to realize these therapies, 
various researches have been done and several methods 
for such therapies have been reported. Among these methods are classical procedures such 
as methods using enteric pharmaceutical preparations and 
sustained release pharmaceutical preparations. However, when using enteric pharmaceutical 
preparations, the release of a medicinal compound starts 
abruptly at the upper small intestine, resulting in 
consumption of almost all of the medicinal compound by 
absorption or decomposition before arrival of the 
medicinal compound at the large intestine, although 
release of the medicinal compound can be effectively 
suppressed in the stomach.  When using sustained release pharmaceutical 
preparations, a considerable amount of the medicinal 
compound is released when the pharmaceutical 
preparation stays in the stomach or passes through the 
small intestine before arrival of the medicinal compound 
at the large intestine, because the medicinal compound 
is continuously released. Further, attempts have been made to suppress the 
release of a medicinal compound in the stomach by 
coating a sustained release pharmaceutical preparation 
with an enteric coat. However, the problem that the 
medicinal compound is released during the passage of the 
pharmaceutical preparation through the small intestine 
has not entirely been solved by the above-mentioned 
enteric-coated sustained release pharmaceutical 
preparation. Moreover as a relatively new technique, it can be 
considered to utilize a technique of controlling the 
starting time of the release. However, taking into 
consideration that the residence time of a 
pharmaceutical preparation in the digestive tract is not 
always constant, it is difficult to envisage

<CLAIMS>
A pharmaceutical preparation controlled to 
release a medicinal compound at a targeted site in the 

intestinal tract, which comprises a medicinal compound-containing

Claim 1 or Claim 2, wherein the medicinal compound-containing 

phase has a lag-time such that the medicinal 
compound is released at the large intestine. 
A pharmaceutical preparation as claimed in any 
one of the preceding claims, wherein the medicinal 

compound-containing phase is a preparation comprising 
(1) a core containing a medicinal compound and an 

organic acid, and (2) a film coat formed around the core 
by aqueous coating of a water-insoluble and slightly 

water-permeable acrylic polymer having a 
trimethylammonioethyl group. 
A pharmaceutical preparation as claimed in any 
 

one of Claims 1 to 3, wherein the medicinal compound-containing 
phase is a preparation comprising (1) a core 

containing a medicinal compound, and (2) a film coat 
provided around the core containing a water-repellent 

substance and a water-insoluble and slightly water-permeable 
acrylic polymer having a trimethylammonioethyl 

group. 
A pharmaceutical preparation as claimed in any 
one of Claims 1 to 3, wherein the medicinal compound-containing 

phase is a preparation comprising (1) a core 
containing a medicinal compound and a water-swellable 

substance, and (2) a coat formed around the core by 
compression coating, said coat containing a 

water-soluble substance and a matrix-formable 
hydrophobic substance. 
A pharmaceutical preparation as claimed in any 
one of the preceding claims, wherein the enteric coating 

phase is a film coat containing an enteric high 
molecular substance.
