<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to rubber compositions, particularly suitable 
for tyre treads having an improved balance of properties such as rolling 

resistance, grip and wear. 
It provides a vulcanisable rubber composition comprising a rubbery 
polymer, vulcanisation agent and filler, the filler comprising silica 

which 
has been pre-coupled with a coupling agent, the coupling agent being at 

least bi-functional whereby it can react with the silica and with the 
polymer. 
The invention also provides a tyre having a tread formed by the 
vulcanisation of such a rubber composition.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to rubber compositions and particularly to 
vulcanisable rubber compositions, e.g. for the manufacture of tyre treads, 
and to tyre treads made from such compositions. It is well known that it is desirable to reduce the rolling resistance of 
a motor vehicle tyre in order to achieve reduced fuel consumption. 
However, it is also well known that reductions in rolling resistance are 
normally achieved at a cost, namely reduced tyre grip and/or reduced wear 
resistance. Previous proposals to reduce the rolling resistance of a tyre have 
included reducing the amount of carbon black in the tread composition, 
using a carbon black of relatively low surface area and adding a polymer 
with a relatively low glass transition temperature. None of these 
proposals has been entirely successful since, for example, a typical 
consequence is an undesirable reduction in tyre wet grip. Hence, there remains a need to improve tyre tread compositions to 
achieve a better overall balance of properties, in particular to improve, i.e. 
reduce, rolling resistance without impairing other properties such as the 
above-mentioned grip and wear.  Accordingly, in one aspect the invention provides a vulcanisable 
rubber composition comprising a rubbery polymer or copolymer, 
vulcanisation agent and filler, the filler comprising silica which has been 
pre-coupled with a coupling agent, the coupling agent being at least bi-functional 
whereby it can react with the silica and with the polymer. 
Normally, the reaction with the polymer will be during the vulcanisation 
stage when the composition is heated to vulcanisation temperature. The coupling agent is preferably a silane coupling agent e.g. bis(3-triethoxy-silyl 
propyl)-tetrasulphide or mercapto propyl triethoxy silane, 
particularly where the vulcanisation agent is sulphur. In these examples, 
the alkoxy moieties react and couple with the silica in the pre-coupling 
reaction and the suphidic moieties react with the rubbery polymer in the 
vulcanisation reaction. Alternatively, the coupling agent may be, for 
example, a vinyl silane, e.g. vinyl triethoxy silane, or a thiocyanatotriethoxy 
silane, e.g. thiocyanato-propyl-triethoxy silane, or a zirconate 
coupling agent, e.g. zirconium dineoalkanato di(3-mercapto) propionato-O. The silica preferably has a nitrogen surface area of from 60 to 300 
m²/g, especially 80 to 250m²/g, and is preferably a precipitated silica. It is 
treated with the coupling agent prior to its incorporation in the rubber 
composition by,
