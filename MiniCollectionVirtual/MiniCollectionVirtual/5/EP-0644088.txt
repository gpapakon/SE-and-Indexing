<ABSTRACT>
The deployment opening (10) for a folded-together air bag (9), which is arranged behind the inner trim (3) of the lateral structure of a motor vehicle, of an air-bag collision protecting device for protecting against lateral collisions, when activated the said air bag (9) being situated between the chest of the occupant (13) of the vehicle and the side structure of the motor vehicle, is, in a first embodiment of the invention, sealed off by means of a cover (11) which is adapted in appearance and style to the inside of the inner trim (3), is connected to the air bag (9) and is clamped at its circumference to the edge of the deployment opening (10). In a second embodiment of the invention, the deployment opening for the air bag is covered by the fabric of the inner trim which is composed of a highly extensible material. When the air bag is inflated, the fabric is extended together with the air bag towards the occupant of the vehicle, the fabric being plastically or elastically deformable. In a further embodiment of the invention, the deployment opening for the air bag is sealed in the inner trim by means of a flap which is adapted in appearance and style to the inside of the inner trim and is pivotably articulated by its upper edge to the inner trim. The flap articulation is preferably arranged in the vicinity of the lower edge of the opening for the side window, so that in the event of a lateral collision, the flap, which is pivoted upwards in front of the window pane by the air bag emerging from the deployment opening, acts as a supporting surface for the air bag and there is substantial avoidance of damage brought about by splinters of glass in the event of the window pane being smashed.
