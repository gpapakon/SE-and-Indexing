<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides the novel culture, Streptomyces hygroscopicus FERM BP-3688 and the macrocyclic lactones which were produced by the culture Streptomyces hygroscopicus (FERM BP-3688), Actinoplanes sp. (FERM BP-3832) or Streptomyces toyocaensis subsp.humicola (ATCC 39471) and an immunosuppressive agent, an antimycotic agent and an antitumor agent which comprises the said macrocyclic lactones. The macrocyclic lactones have formula (I) wherein R
<

 is oxygen, two hydrogens or one hydrogen and one hydroxy; R
<

, R
<

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel macrocyclic lactones, the productive strain 
therefor, a process for their production and their use. Particularly this invention relates 
to the novel macrocyclic lactones produced by fermentation of the culture which is 
deposited as FERM BP-3688, FERM BP-3832 or American Type Culture Collection, 
ATCC 39471. This invention also relates to the immunosuppressive, antimycotic and 
antitumor compositions, which include the macrocyclic lactones as active ingredients. 
Further this invention relates to the process for producing the macrocyclic lactones by 
fermenting the above deposited cultures. In 1983, the United States Food and Drug Administration licensed cyclosporin, 
an anti-rejection drug that revolutionized the field of organ transplant surgery. The drug 
acts by inhibiting the body's immune system from mobilizing its vast arsenal of 
natural protecting agents to reject the transplant's foreign protein. Although cyclosporin 
is effective in fighting transplantation rejection, it suffers drawbacks in causing kidney 
failure, liver damage and ulcers which in many cases can be very severe. Newer, safer 
drugs exhibiting less side effects are constantly being searched for. Recently, it has 
been demonstrated that the macrolide immunosuppressive FK-506, FK-520 (European 
Patent Publication No. 0184162; Japanese Patent KOKAI Sho61-148181) and its related 
compounds and rapamycin (United States Patent No. 3929992 and No. 3993749) 
show a potent immunosuppressive activity both in vitro and in vivo. FK506 is 
known to cause serious side effects such as kidney damage, but nothing is known 
about serious side effects of rapamycin in humans (R. L. Simmons and S. C. Wang, 
Transplant. Proc., 23, 2152-2156, 1991). As to rapamycin derivatives, 
27-demethoxyrapamycin is the only natural product (J. A. Findlay et al., Can. J. Chem., 
60, 2046-2047, 1982), whereas 21 ,22-Dihydrorapamycin; 19,20,21,22-tetra-hydrorapamycin 
(United States patent No. 5023262); 42-oxorapamycin (United States 
Patent No. 5023263); acyl derivatives of rapamycin (United States Patent No. 5100883) 
and aminoacyl derivatives of rapamycin (European Patent No. 467606) are 
chemical-synthesized products. In addition, after applicant's Japanese priority date, 27-demethylrapamycin 
(United States Patent No. 5091389) and 16,27-didemethylrapamycin 
(United States Patent No. 5093338) were published. Generally speaking, it is in many  
 
cases difficult to modify selectively a certain functional group of natural
