<ABSTRACT>
A caliper logging sonde is provided having a 
plurality of sensing fingers each of which is pivotally 

mounted to the sonde and movable with respect to the 
sonde in response to variations in the internal 

dimensions of a wellbore tube through which the sonde 
passes. An electrical signal which is proportional to 

variations in the internal dimensions of a wellbore tube 
is determined at regular time intervals at a series of 

points around the circumference of the wellbore tube. A 
maximum and minimum dimension for each point around the 

circumference of the wellbore tube during a selected time 
interval is temporarily stored and thereafter transmitted 

to the surface at regular intervals. A high density 
array of sensors is provided by utilizing a transducer 

plate having a large number of cylindrical apertures 
disposed around the circumference thereof. Thimble 

members, each having an internal chamber and an elongate 
body narrower than the cylindrical aperture are fixedly 

inserted into one end of each of the detector plate 
apertures while an associated electrical coil is inserted 

into each aperture from the other end, surrounding the 
elongate body. Movable magnetic rods within the internal 

chamber of each thimble are then variably positioned in 
response to movement of the sensing fingers and the 

variable inductance of each electrical coil is then 
utilized to produce an electrical signal proportional to 

variations in the internal dimensions of the tube under 
measurement.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to methods
and systems for accurately measuring the internal
dimensions of a tube within a borehole and in particular
to a method and system for measuring and storing maximum
and minimum variations in internal dimensions of a tube
within a borehole over a predetermined time interval.
Still more particularly, the present invention relates to
a system for providing highly accurate measurement of
borehole tube internal dimensions utilizing a large
number of closely spaced detectors.The modern petrochemical industry utilizes a
large number of tubes which are designated primarily for
the circulation of fluids within a wellbore. Notable
examples of such tubes are those utilized for well
drilling and fluid circulation in an oil well. In actual
practice, it is often necessary to measure the
ovalization or corrosion of either the internal or
external surfaces of these tubes to ensure that tubing
which is about to fail is replaced. Such measurements
are often carried out in atmospheres which may be
deleterious or difficult to reach, for example at the
bottom of an oil well in the case of tubing strings. In
order to carry out these measurements, provisions must be
made for a reliable and accurate measurement which
operates in a simple and straightforward manner.Early systems for measuring the shape of a
cylindrical tube within a wellbore were primarily
impression-taking devices of a mechanical type which may 
produce electrical signals as a result of mechanical
contact between the measuring device and a dimension of
the tubing. Typically such devices utilizing an
engraving stylus on a substrate for the purpose of
marking a curve which corresponds to ovalization of a
cylinder or to surface defects within the cylinder.
These devices are complicated by reason of the fact that
they require high precision mechanical transmission
systems and the fact that a mechanical marking operation
impairs the sensitivity of the measurement over time.
Moreover, such devices do not immediately deliver usable
information since the device must be removed to the
surface of a wellbore for analyzation after the
measurements have been taken.Electromechanical devices utilizing multiple
feeler arms have been proposed which overcome this
mechanical device problem. One example is set forth in
U.S. Patent No. 4,186,494, Peruchon Edouard et al.,
issued February 5, 1980. The transducers set forth
within the above-referenced United States patent are
quite bulky and only a limited number of fingers may be
placed
