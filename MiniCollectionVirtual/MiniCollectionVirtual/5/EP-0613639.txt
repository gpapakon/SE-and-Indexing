<ABSTRACT>
A slide for drawers having a body-side supporting rail (4) and a drawer-side extension rail (5) on each side of the drawer, load-transmitting rollers (8, 11) being mounted on the rails (4, 5). The rollers (8, 11) of the supporting rails (4) and of the extension rails (5) are perpendicularly offset with respect to the pull-out direction of the extension rails (5), in such a way that the extension rails (5) are guided in two tracks. The extension rails (5) each have at least one horizontal tab (12) which reaches underneath the running web (6) of the supporting rail (4) and forms a lift-prevention means for the drawer.
