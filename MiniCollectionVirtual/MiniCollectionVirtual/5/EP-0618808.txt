<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns gonadotropin
containing pharmaceutical compositions. More precisely,
it concerns compositions of sucrose-stabilized
gonadotropins. The gonadotropins of the present
invention comprise FSH (Follicle Stimulating Hormone),
LH (Luteinizing Hormone) and hCG (Human Chorionic
Gonadotropin).It is known that highly purified proteins are
time-unstable and are stabilized, for instance, in
admixture with saccharides, such as lactose and
mannitol, or else with proteins and aminoacids, such as
albumin and glycine. Other high-molecular-weight
compounds, having a biological origin, as, for instance,
the marine colloids, dextran and other
polysaccharides and the phospholipids often work equally
well. Anyway, since the gonadotropins of the present
invention are administered parenterally, these
excipients are not suited for an injectable composition
because of their allergenicity or their insufficient
solubility, in some cases because of their potential
toxicity or a concourse of these effects.The composition of lyophilised proteins is
described in M.J. Pikal, BioPharm, October 1990, 25-30.
There are reported examples of proteins, such as
growth hormone and ribonuclease A, formulated by using
stabilizing excipients such as mannitol, glycine,
arginine and lactose.In particular, the lyophilisation is described of
proteins in the presence of various substances in
their amorphous state, as sugars, which increase the 
collapse temperature and permit to obtain shorter lyophilisation times. However, it
is not feasible, according to the author, to foresee a standard formulation for all
the proteins, and the choice of the best formulation requires a remarkable selection
work.German patent DE 3520228 describes bioactive proteins such as
lymphokines, interferons, TNF (Tumor Necrosis Factor), insulin, growth
hormone, in formulations which are stabilized by means of polysaccharides
comprising repetitive maltotriose units. The use of sucrose as a stabilizing agent is
known, for instance, in a formulation of lyophilized orgotein, as described in US
patent 3,637,640. International patent application WO 89/10407 describes the
formulation with sucrose of M-CSF (Macrophage-Colony Stimulating Factor);
patent application WO 89/09610 describes, instead, formulations of TNF which
have been stabilized with albumin, dextran, polyethylene glycol, 80 polysorbate
PVPâ„¢, lactose, trialose or even sucrose.The injectable formulations of gonadotropins are obtained by a process
which includes their lyophilisation in order to
