<ABSTRACT>
An electric heating device (34) in which is included an electric energy source (45) which is designed as a thin film battery (45). The heating device also includes a resistor heating unit (40) comprising a first material stratum (40) consisting of an electrically conductive polymer material with PTC properties. The resitor heating unit (40) and the electric energy source (45) are disposed adjacent one another and form a composite unit in which the major surfaces of said first material stratum (40) and thin film battery (45), respectively, face towards one another. Electrodes (41, 43) are connected, by the intermediary of a switch (48), to the poles of the battery (45) and to the resistor heating unit (40).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a heating device according to the
preamble of the independent claim.Within many fields of activity, it is desirable to heat different
parts of the body, for example for medical purposes or for reasons of
comfort. One example is the heating of joints, hands and other parts
of the body of rheumatism sufferers. Another example is within the
areas of sports and leisure activities where proposals have been put
forward for heated gloves, shoe inlays and other items of clothing as
well as sleeping-bags.It is also desirable in the art to devise containers which, on
transport or power failure, maintain an elevated temperature in their
storage space. Similarly, there are needs for substrates which, on
transport or power failure, maintain an elevated temperature, for
example to avoid the risk that the temperature falls in accumulators
or batteries placed on the substrates - which could lead to a reduction
in the quantity of energy which can be extracted from them.To cover these needs numerous solutions have been proposed in the art,
these all being based on electric heating with the aid of various
resistor heating elements and electric energy sources, normally
accumulators or dry cell batteries. As examples of this known
technology, mention might be made of Swedish patent application No.
8402743-2 which describes a glove intended for rheumatics with inlaid
resistor wires and a current source so as to develop a thermal effect
exceeding 25 W in the glove.In a corresponding manner, Swedish patent application No. 8404783-6
describes a medical undergarment with inlaid resistor heating elements
and a current source in the form of a battery. Electrically heated
shoe inlays are described, for instance, in the two German specifications 
DE-A-3 904 603 and DE-C-4 000 259. These shoe inlays have inlaid
resistor heating elements which are connectable to a battery or other
source of electric energy. In both cases, the resistor heating
elements are in the form of printed conductor paths on a base consisting
of plastic or other non-conductive material. In both cases, the
heating proper is also controlled by means of electric circuit connections
so as to as avoid overheating.As was mentioned above, it is known in the leisure-time sector to make
use of electrically heated sleeping-bags or garments. One example is
disclosed in US-A-3,443,066 which describes a sleeping-bag or other
clothing garment of flexible, thermally insulating material with
inlaid resistor heating wires and batteries for
