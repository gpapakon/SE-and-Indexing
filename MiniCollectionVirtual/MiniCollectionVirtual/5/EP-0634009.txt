<ABSTRACT>
The improved sample chamber includes an elongated hollow tube (12) closed at one end (14) and having specularly-reflective inwardly facing surfaces (16). A source (26) of radiation and a detector (28) of radiation are mounted side by side in the open end of the hollow tube, both facing the closed end. A plurality of filtering apertures (20) are formed in the tube (12), and each aperture is covered by a sheet (22) of a semipermeable membrane that serves to prevent airborne particles larger than a predetermined size from entering the chamber while not interfering with the free diffusion of the gas to be measured into and out of the chamber. The use of an elongated hollow tube that is closed at one end results in no loss in the efficiency with which the radiation is conducted from the source to the detector while decreasing the external length of the chamber by 50 percent.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is in the field of gas analysis, and specifically relates
to apparatus using a nondispersive infrared gas analysis technique to determine
the concentration of a particular type of gas present in a sample chamber by
sensing the absorption of infrared radiation passing through the gas.A comparatively new development in the field of nondispersive infrared gas
analyzers has been the diffusion-type gas sample chamber. In a diffusion-type gas
sample chamber, the gas to be measured enters and leaves the chamber by
diffusion.One example of a diffusion-type gas sample chamber is described in the
parent application. In that invention, the sample chamber has the form of a tube
composed of a gastight material, having apertures covered by semipermeable
membranes through which the gas to be measured enters and leaves the sample
chamber by diffusion. This same approach is used in the present invention, with
some important modifications.Another example of a diffusion-type gas sample chamber is described in
U.S. Patent No. 4,709,150 to Burough et al. In their invention, the body of the
sample chamber is composed of a porous material through which the gas to be 
measured passes by diffusion. Burough et al. do not teach or suggest using the
walls of the porous tube as reflective radiation-guiding elements.An example of a non-diffusion-type gas sample chamber is shown in
Japanese Patent Publication No. 59-173734(A) of Miyazaki. In that analyzer, the
sample cells have the form of helical tubes. The gas to be measured must be
pressurized to force it to flow through the sample tube.Another example of a non-diffusion-type of gas sample chamber is shown
in Japanese Publication No. 63-298031 by Fujimura, in which air is rammed into
the sample chamber by motion of the sample chamber through the air.In the present application, the inventor will describe an improvement on
the sample chamber described in the parent application to make it more compact
while maintaining its radiation-handling efficiency.US-A-5 125 742 further shows a suction or flow-through-type apparatus in
which gas is pumped into a cell - used for spectrographic analysis - through an
inlet pipe and than exits the cell through an outlet pipe. Said apparatus
comprises a right circular cylinder having flat end plates. Said cylinder and said
end plates - with the exception of small transparent windows in the end plates -
are coated to reflect the radiation employed. A source and detectors are
arranged on opposite ends of said cell and are spaced

<CLAIMS>
A diffusion-type gas sample chamber for transmitting
radiation produced by a source (26) of radiation through gases present in the

chamber by ambient pressure diffusion to a detector (28) of radiation, characterized
by:


a) an elongated hollow tube (12) having an inner wall and having a closed

end (14) and an open end, composed of a gastight material and having a specularly-reflective
surface on the inner wall (16) and on the inwardly-facing side (18) of the closed

end (14);
b) said tube (12) including a plurality of filtering apertures (20) arrayed along
said tube (12) for improving the diffusion into and out of the space within said tube (12);
c) a sheet of a semipermeable membrane (22) covering each of said
plurality of filtering apertures (20), said semipermeable membrane (22) permitting gases to

diffuse through it under ambient pressure into and out of the space within said
tube (12) and preventing airborne particles larger than a predetermined size from

entering said space;
d) means (32) for mounting both said source (26) of radiation and said detector (28)
of radiation in said open end and facing said closed end (14), whereby some

of the radiation emitted in various directions from said source (26) of radiation is
conducted by at least one reflection from the specularly-reflective surface on the

inner wall (16) to the specularly-reflective surface on the inwardly-facing side (18) of the
closed end (14) and from the latter by at least one reflection from the specularlyreflective

surface on the inner wall (16) to said detector (28) of radiation.
The diffusion-type gas sample chamber of Claim 1 further
characterized by heater means (34) adjacent the open end of said tube for supplying

heat to said tube (12) to prevent condensation on said source (26) of radiation, on said
detector (28) of radiation and on said specularly-reflective surface.
The diffusion-type gas sample chamber of Claim 1
wherein said predetermined size is 0.3 microns. 
The diffusion-type gas sample chamber of Claim 1 further
characterized by a narrow passband filter (30) located in the path of the radiation

between the source (26) of radiation and the detector (28) of radiation and passing only
radiation lying in a chosen wavelength band.
