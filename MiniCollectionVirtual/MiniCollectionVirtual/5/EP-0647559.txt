<ABSTRACT>
The satellite, having a payload intended to be stabilised in the station about three axes on a geostationary orbit, comprises a structure which has walls facing north and south when the satellite is in station and which carries at least one battery of accumulators (storage cells). The battery, or each battery of accumulators (24) consists of cells (32) mounted on a chassis having a base (31) oriented north-south and mechanically fixed to flanges (33) facing north and south when the satellite is in station, the said flanges (33) carrying or constituting thermal radiators which are thermally connected to each other and to the cells (32).

Satellite having a payload, intended to be 
stabilized on station about three axes on a geostationary 

orbit, comprising a structure which has walls which face 
North and South when the satellite is on station and which 

carries at least one storage cells,
 
   characterized in that the storage battery, or each 

storage battery, (24) is constituted by cells (32) mounted 
on a chassis having a base plate (31) oriented North-South, 

mechanically secured to sides (33) that face North 
and South when the satellite is on station, said sides 

(33) carrying or constituting thermal radiators that are 
thermally connected to each other and to the cells (32). 
Satellite according to claim 1, characterized in 
that said sides are in alignment with the North and South 

walls and extend away from the Earth. 
Satellite according to claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the radiators are connected by thermal leak 

paths in contact with the cells, such as braids or heat 
pipes. 
Satellite according to claim 1, 2 or 3, characterized 
in that the chassis is provided with means for 

connection on a plurality of walls having different angular 
positions of the satellite structure. 
Satellite according to claim 4, characterized in 
that the sides (33) are provided with flanges (44) for 

connection with the North and South sides and in that the 
base plate is provided with tabs (36) for connection with 

a plate which is located in a plane which is parallel to 
the North-South direction and East-West direction and with 

brackets (38) for connection on the East and West sides. 
Satellite according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the means for connection 

with the structure are so located as to enable mounting 
while the satellite is in launching condition.  

 
Satellite according to any one of claims 1-6, 
characterized in that the radiators are constituted by 

plates having a high radiating coefficient carried by the 
sides or constituting the sides, which possibly have a 

radiating and reflecting coating. 
Satellite according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that it comprises two storage 

batteries which are disposed symmetrically with respect to 
a midplane of the structure. 
Satellite according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that each storage battery is 

constituted by cells of generally cylindrical shape, 
located orthogonally to the base plate, traversing the 

base plate and fixed to the base plate.
