<ABSTRACT>
An adhesive composition containing a latex binder, a 
latex plasticizer and a functional filler. The latex 

plasticizer includes a copolymer comprising (1) 0-15% by 
weight, based upon the weight of the copolymer, of 

acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile or mixtures thereof, (ii) 
80-85% by weight, based upon the weight of the copolymer, 

of butyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, 2-ethylhexyl acrylate, 
lauryl acrylate, lauryl methacrylate, octyl acrylate, 

heptyl acrylate, or mixtures thereof, and (iii) 1-5% by 
weight, based upon the weight of the copolymer, of 

methacrylic acid, acrylic acid, itaconic acid, or mixtures 
thereof, said latex plasticizer having a T
g
 less than that 
of the latex binder (a) and a decomposition temperature of 

at least 288째C. The composition is useful for adhering 
polyimide films such as in the fabrication of flexible 

circuits.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an adhesive composition with 
a functional filler. More particularly it relates to an 
adhesive composition for polyimide films and is useful in 
the fabrication of solderable flexible circuits. The flexible circuit industry requires adhesives for 
polyimide film and metal foils (usually copper) which can 
withstand elevated temperatures and a variety of harsh 
solvents and chemicals. During the many preparation and 
processing steps for circuit manufacture, these solvents 
and chemicals can cause an adhesive to swell leading to 
blister formation and/or delamination, which results in 
reduced circuit yields. The application of heat, such as 
in soldering, can similarly cause circuit failures. U.S. Patents 3,822,175, 3,900,662 and 3,728,150 
disclose crosslinkable acrylic adhesive compositions for 
bonding polyimide films. Copper-polyimide laminates made 
using such adhesive compositions have good peel strength, 
are stable to soldering temperatures and are resistant to 
chemicals typically used in circuit manufacture. It is sometimes desirable, however, to use adhesive 
compositions which have additional properties, such as 
flame retardancy, electrical conductivity, thermal 
conductivity, etc. Such special adhesive compositions are 
usually obtained by the addition of functional fillers to 
the basic composition. However, fillers tend to make the 
adhesive more brittle which adversely affects the peel 
strength of laminates made with the filled adhesive. This 
brittleness can be overcome somewhat by the addition of 
plasticizers, however these frequently are attacked by  
 
processing chemicals and generally are not stable at 
soldering temperatures, which can result in blister 
formation. Thus, there is a need for an adhesive for polyimide 
film which has special functional properties without 
sacrificing peel strength, chemical resistance or thermal 
stability. This invention relates to an adhesive composition 
comprising: 
(a) 40-75% by weight, based upon the total 
amount of adhesive dry solids, of a latex comprising 1-10% 
by weight, based upon the latex dry components, of a 
crosslinking agent and 90-99% by dry weight, based upon the 
latex dry components, of a copolymer comprising (i) 30-50% 
by weight, based upon the weight of the copolymer, of 
acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile or mixtures thereof, (ii) 
45-70% by weight, based upon the weight of the copolymer, 
of butyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, 2-ethylhexyl acrylate, 
lauryl acrylate, lauryl methacrylate, octyl
