<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus 
according to the preamble of claim 1. As an overview, metalworking operations are 
typically performed using a cutting insert of a hard 
metal. Such an insert is mounted to a toolholder. The 
toolholder is secured either temporarily or permanently 
to a base member which is part of a machine such as a 
lathe or a milling machine. Because of the extreme conditions under which 
they operate, cutting inserts must be replaced on a 
regular basis. In order to do this the cutting insert 
must be removed from the toolholder. The economies of 
the metalworking operation make it inefficient to shut 
a machine down for the length of time required to 
replace a cutting insert on a toolholder. It is more 
desirable to utilize a removeable toolholder such that 
the entire toolholder with the accompanying cutting 
insert may be removed and replaced with another 
toolholder having a new cutting insert already in 
position on the toolholder. With this in mind the focus for efficiency 
then becomes the ease and the speed with which the 
toolholder may be replaced. This has been one of the  
 
motivating factors producing different commercial 
designs for quick change toolholders. One example of such a design may be found in 
US-A-4 747 735 entitled "Toolholder and 
Method of Releasably Mounting" by Erickson et al, which 
is assigned to the applicant of the subject invention 
and which is hereby incorporated by reference. The details of this patent, which are prior 
art, are shown in Figures 1 and 2 and will be used to 
provide an overview of the design for quick change 
toolholders. Looking at Figure 1, on a toolholder 10 
having a forward end 15 a cutting insert 20 is mounted. 
The cutting insert 20 is spaced from the toolholder 10 
by a shim 25, and both the cutting insert 20 and shim 
25 are held to the toolholder by means such as a clamp 
30 which is secured to the toolholder 10 by a pin 35. 
The toolholder 10 has a rearwardly facing abutment face 
40 along with a tubular shank 45 extending rearwardly 
from the forward end 15 and has a shank wall 50. The 
toolholder 10 may have a slot 53 within the shank wall 
50 and spaced perforations 55 in the shank wall 50. 
The toolholder 10 may have forwardly facing concave 
contact surfaces 60 within the perforations 55. The toolholder is positioned about a 
longitudinal axis 56 and this axis 56 will be used as a 
reference throughout this specification. As evidenced 
by the drawings, many features discussed in the 
specification

a toolholder support member (230) having a forwardly 
facing abutment face (280) for contact with said toolholder 

rearwardly facing abutment face (40) and an opening (285) 
extending rearwardly therefrom to receive said toolholder 

(10) and said adapter canister (200) with said locking 
elements (210), characterized in that 


a) the canister (200) has depressions (205) in 
positions corresponding to said perforations (55) such that 

in the inserted position the depressions (205) are generally 
aligned with said shank perforations (55); 
b) said locking element (21) is positioned within 
each perforation (55) and depression (205) to provide 

rigidity along the longitudinal axis (56) between said 
toolholder (10) and said adapter canister (200) by capturing 

said locking elements (210) between the respective 
depressions (205) and the toolholder perforation forwardly 

facing concave contact surfaces (60) when said adapter 
canister (200) is urged away from said toolholder (10); 
c) said opening (285) of said toolholder support 
member (230) comprises three portions, an opening first 

portion (290) to receive said shank (45), an opening second 
portion (300) to r
eceive and hold nonrotatably said adapter 
canister (200) and an opening third portion (310) from which
