<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to nickel-base alloy compositions 
and more specifically to a family of nickel-base alloys 
containing more than 18, but less than 23 atom percent molybdenum in combination 
with low but critical amounts of certain other substitutional 
alloying elements which provide thermal stability to the metallurgical 
structure. Early in the twentieth century, it was noticed that the 
addition of substantial amounts (above 15 percent) of molybdenum 
to nickel markedly improved nickel's resistance to corrosion by 
reducing acids such as acetic, hydrochloric or phosphoric acids. 
However, with increasing amounts of molybdenum, the alloys became 
much more difficult, if not impossible, to work into common 
shapes. Therefore, the first commercially available alloy of 
this type, called simply alloy "B", contained about 18 or 19 
percent molybdenum (all concentrations herein are expressed in 
atomic percentages) along with significant amounts (7 to 12 
percent) of iron (primarily from the use of ferro-molybdenum in 
the manufacturing process, but also often added to reduce cost) 
as well as several percents of incidental additions or impurities 
including carbon, manganese and silicon. See, for example, 
U.S. Patent No, 1,710,445 granted in 1929 to a predecessor of 
the present assignee. While these alloys were relatively easy to cast into shapes, 
great difficulty was encountered in hot working them into plates 
and sheets for later fabrication into chemical vessels, piping 
and the like. During the 1940's, the developer of alloy B,  
 
Haynes Stellite Co., continued to work toward improving this 
alloy family and, among other things, determined that copper was 
one of the elements most detrimental to hot workability. As 
disciosed in U.S. Patent No. 2,315,497, the corrosion rate was 
unaffected by keeping the copper content below about 0.15 percent. 
Therefore, even today, copper is maintained as low as 
possible and preferably below about 0.5 percent. Such alloys had good resistance to wet corrosion by non-oxidizing 
acids so long as the formation of second phase precipitates 
was avoided. Such precipitates, usually forming along 
grain boundaries in the heat affected zones during welding, promoted 
rapid intergranular corrosion by depleting adjacent areas 
in molybdenum. Thus, all welded structures needed a solutionizing 
or stabilizing heat treatment (e.g., 1100°C for one hour) 
followed by rapid cooling to suppress such corrosion. This 
effect is discussed in more detail in U.S.
