<ABSTRACT>
Described are crimped acrylic fibers with a small diameter, a 
minimum aspect ratio (L/D) in the 20-50 range, and having a 

crimp of greater than about 3% so as to enhance the viscosity 
of polymers, resistance to gravity-induced slumping when 

applied to vertical surfaces, and mix stability, as well as 
provide matrix reinforcement and toughness. The crimped 

acrylic fibers are adapted to act as improved physical 
thixotropes in adhesives, sealants, coatings, paints, grouts, 

building materials and the like.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to crimped acrylic fibers, thixotropic
agents and compositions and especially to the use of crimped
acrylic fibers as thixotropes.Fibers have been added to organic and inorganic matrices to
improve the viscosity and the handling characteristics of the
mix and the toughness of the cured or solidified product.
Fibers provide a combination of viscosity control and
reinforcement, whereas particulate and chemical additives
only improve viscosity. Asbestos fibers and other inorganic
fibers, such as ceramic, glass, and the like, have been used
in various resin systems to prepare sealants, mastics,
putties and adhesive formulations. Health hazards in the use
of asbestos are well known. Moreover, inorganic fibers,
because of their intrinsic brittleness, can fracture during
mixing to create a higher percentage of very short fibers,
and these result in variability and loss of performance as
fiber thixotropes, because short, broken fibers generally do
not provide maximum reinforcement and viscosity enhancement.The inorganic thixotropes have been supplanted to a
significant extent by polymeric fibers, especially by
fibrillated polyolefin and polyaramid fibers. Fibrillation
is a means of texturizing which comprises stretching a fiber
or film to fully or partially orient it and then breaking it
transversely apart or mechanically abrading it to provide an
interlaced fibrous structure. Such fibers induce high
viscosities, but they are difficult to disperse in resins,
and tend to result in inhomogeneous mixtures. Additionally,
their adhesion to the cured resin is generally poor unless
special surface treatments are carried out on the fibrillated
fibers. Examples of such commercially available fibrillated
polymeric fibers adapted for use as physical thixotropes are: 
KEVLAR®, and ULTRATHIX®, poly para-phenyleneterephtalimide,
and PULPLUS™, linear polyethylene, both products of the Du
Pont Company, Wilmington, DE, USA. Also commercially
available are polyethylene fibers sold under the tradenames
SHORT STUFF® and FYBREL® by Minifibers, Inc., Johnson City,
TN, USA. The use of KEVLAR® aramid pulped fibers, in the
range of from about 0.1 to 5.0 % by weight, for viscosity
control in poly(vinyl chloride) plastisols, in silicones, in
epoxy resins, and in polyurethanes is described in Research
Disclosure No. 29676, April 1987.Acrylic fibers, e.g., fibers of a co-polymer containing
acrylonitrile in a quantity more than 85 wt-%, have good
extensibility, which prevents their fragmentation during
mixing, and they
