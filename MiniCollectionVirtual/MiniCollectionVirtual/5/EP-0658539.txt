<DESCRIPTION>
In the mammalian central nervous system (CNS), the 
transmission of nerve impulses is controlled by the 
interaction between a neurotransmitter, that is released by a 
sending neuron, and a surface receptor on a receiving neuron, 
which causes excitation of this receiving neuron. L-Glutamate, 
which is the most abundant neurotransmitter in the 
CNS, mediates the major excitatory pathway in mammals, and is 
referred to as an excitatory amino acid (EAA). The receptors 
that respond to glutamate are called excitatory amino acid 
receptors (EAA receptors). See Watkins & Evans, Ann. Rev.Pharmacol. Toxicol., 21, 165 (1981); Monaghan, Bridges, and 
Cotman, Ann. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol., 29, 365 (1989); 
Watkins, Krogsgaard-Larsen, and Honore, Trans. Pharm. Sci., 
11, 25 (1990). The excitatory amino acids are of great 
physiological importance, playing a role in a variety of 
physiological processes, such as long-term potentiation 
(learning and memory), the development of synaptic 
plasticity, motor control, respiration, cardiovascular 
regulation, and sensory perception. Excitatory amino acid receptors are classified into two 
general types. Receptors that are directly coupled to the 
opening of cation channels in the cell membrane of the 
neurons are termed "ionotropic." This type of receptor has 
been subdivided into at least three subtypes, which are 
defined by the depolarizing actions of the selective agonists 
N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic 
acid (AMPA), and kainic acid 
(KA). The second general type of receptor is the G-protein 
or second messenger-linked "metabotropic" excitatory amino 
acid receptor. This second type is coupled to multiple 
second messenger systems that lead to enhanced 
phosphoinositide hydrolysis, activation of phospholipase D, 
increases or decreases in cAMP formation, and changes in ion 
channel function. Schoepp and Conn, Trends in Pharmacol. 
Sci., 14, 13 (1993). Both types of receptors appear not only  
 
to mediate normal synaptic transmission along excitatory 
pathways, but also participate in the modification of 
synaptic connections during development and throughout life. 
Schoepp, Bockaert, and Sladeczek, Trends in Pharmacol . Sci.,11, 508 (1990); McDonald and Johnson, Brain Research Reviews,15, 41 (1990). The excessive or inappropriate stimulation of excitatory 
amino acid receptors leads to neuronal cell damage or loss by 
way of a mechanism known as excitotoxicity. This process has 
been suggested to mediate neuronal
