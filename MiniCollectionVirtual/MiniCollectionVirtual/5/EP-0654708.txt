<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the use of a solid processing composition
for a silver halide color photographic light-sensitive
material, and particularly to the use of a solid processing composition
for a silver halide photographic light-sensitive material
having excellent storage stability and solubility, and having
markedly improved stability.A silver halide photographic light-sensitive material is
photographically processed through a development step, a
bleaching step, a washing step and a stabilization step after
being exposed. The photographic processing is ordinarily
conducted using an automatic processing machine. On such
occasions, a replenisher replenishing system is commonly used
wherein the processing solution in a processing tank is
controlled so that the activity thereof is kept constant. In 
the case of the replenisher replenishing system, the purposes
thereof include dilution of materials dissolved out from the
light-sensitive material, correction of the amount of
evaporation and replenishment of consumed components. Because
of solution replenishing, much overflow-solution is ordinarily
discharged.Recently, world wide movements for regulations on
prohibiting dumping photo-effluent into oceans and regulations
against disposal of plastic materials have been promoted.
Accordingly, development of a new system in which photographic
waste solution is markedly reduced and bottles for processing
agents are eliminated is demanded. In addition, safety
regulations on packaging materials have been strengthened
to maintain safety regarding the transportation of liquid
hazardous substances, resulting in an increase of cost. In
mini-labs which have recently proliferated rapidly, errors
frequently occur during dissolution or dilution operations of
the replenishing solutions due to a lack of manpower.
Therefore, this conventional replenishment system has drawn
frequent complaint.Accordingly, in the photographic industry a new
replenishing system is demanded in which photographic waste
solution is markedly reduced, bottles for processing agents
are eliminated and dissolving operations are also eliminated.In response to these demands Japanese Patent O.P.I
Publication No. 5-119454/1993 discloses a method of tableting 
almost all processing components and directly supplying
tablets in processing tanks. Japanese Patent O.P.I
Publication No. 4-237045/1992 discloses a method of setting
powdered processing agents in part in automatic processors,
and directly supplying them in processing tanks after weighing
