<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the 
purification of 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane and in 
particular to a process for the removal of 
1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethane from 
1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane. In recent years chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), 
which are used on a large scale around the world, 
have been perceived as having an adverse effect on 
the ozone layer andlor as contributing to global 
warming. CFCs are used, for example, as refrigerants, 
as foam blowing agents, as cleaning solvents and as 
propellants for aerosol sprays in which the variety 
of applications is virtually unlimited. Consequently, 
attempts have been made to find suitable replacements 
which will perform satisfactorily in the many 
applications in which CFCs are used but which will 
not have the aforementioned damaging effect on the 
ozone layer. The search for suitable replacements has 
in general centred on fluorocarbons which do not 
contain chlorine. The hydrofluorocarbon, 
1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane, also known as HFA 134a, 
has been of particular interest as one such 
replacement, in particular as a replacement for 
dichlorodifluoromethane (CFC 12) in refrigeration 
applications. HFA 134a may be produced in a variety of ways, 
amongst which may be mentioned hydrogenation of a 
chlorofluorocarbon, and fluorination of an alkene or 
a hydrochlorofluorocarbon with hydrogen fluoride or 
an alkali metal fluoride; a catalyst such as chromia, 
halogenated chromia or chromium oxyhalide may be 
employed to facilitate the reaction. However, a characteristic of known processes for 
the production of HFA 134a is that many by-products  
 
tend to be produced. Some of the by-products are easy to separate by 
distillation. However a by-product which it is desirable to remove, or at least 
reduce to low levels, for example below 50 ppm, is 1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethane 
(HFA 134). HFA 134 has a boiling point close to that of HFA 134a, making 
them difficult to separate by distillation. It has already been proposed to use molecular sieves for the removal of 
certain types of impurities from HFA 134a. Thus, for example, in US Patent 
4,906,796 there is disclosed a process for the removal of 
2-chloro-1,1-difluoroethylene (HCFC 1122) from HFA 134a in which an HFA 
134a stream is passed over a molecular sieve which has a pore size of 3.8 to 
4.8 Angstroms; the sieve may be carbon or a zeolite such as zeolite 5A or 
calcium chabazite. It is noted that the zeolites are described in this US patent 
as having little or no capacity for other impurities,

zeolite is a 5A synthetic zeolite or a naturally 

derived chabazite zeolite. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 which comprises 
passing a stream of 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane 

containing 1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethane in the liquid or 
vapour phase over a bed of zeolite particles having a 

mean particle size in the range from 1 
micrometer to 5 centimetres. 
A process as claimed in claim 4 in which 
1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane vapour is passed over the 

zeolite with a gas hourly space velocity of 10 to 
3600 hr

A process as claimed in claim 4 wherein the 
1,1.1,2-tetrafluoroethane is in the liquid phase and 

the liquid hourly space velocity 
is 1 to 30 hr

.  
 
A process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 6 
in which the temperature is from -30°C to 

100°C. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 in which the 
1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane which is contacted with the 

zeolite contains from 100 to 10000ppm 
1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethane and the 

1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane which is recovered from the 
process contains less than 50ppm 

1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethane. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 which further 
comprises heating the zeolite after use in the 

process of claim 1 in a gas stream whereby to desorb
