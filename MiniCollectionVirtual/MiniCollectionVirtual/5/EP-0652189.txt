<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a perovskite-based 
piezoelectric ceramic containing Pb. More 
particularly, the present invention is concerned with a 
piezoelectric ceramic whose piezoelectric constant d and 
Curie point values are both large, so that it is useful 
especially as a material of a piezoelectric actuator. The piezoelectric actuator which utilizes the reverse 
piezoelectric effect of a piezoelectric ceramic finds 
various uses in, for example, precision position setting, a 
printer and a camera shutter. The piezoelectric ceramic 
for use in the piezoelectric actuator is specifically 
required to have large value of piezoelectric constant d so 
that the displacement per voltage is large, and also to 
exhibit high Curie point so that the piezoelectric actuator 
can be used at a temperature in a wide range. A piezoelectric ceramic represented by the formula: 
Pb[(Ni1-bZnb)1/3Nb2/3]O3-PbTiO3-PbZrO3 
is known as an example of a piezoelectric ceramic having a 
relatively large value of piezoelectric constant d and 
relatively high Curie point. The above piezoelectric 
ceramic is described in, for example, Japanese Patent  
 
Publication No. 48(1973)-8434 and Japanese Patent Laid-open 
Publication No. 5(1993)-58729. With respect to the above piezoelectric ceramic 
represented by the formula: 
Pb[(Ni1-bZnb)1/3Nb2/3]O3-PbTiO3-PbZrO3, 
the less the content of Pb[(Ni1-bZnb)1/3Nb2/3]O3 or the 
greater the value of b, the higher the Curie point but the 
smaller the value of the piezoelectric constant d. When the piezoelectric actuator is used in, for 
example, a high-speed drive element employed in a printer 
or the like, a high frequency and a high voltage are 
applied, so that the temperature of the element is raised. 
When the temperature of the element rises to about the 
Curie point, the displacement is rapidly reduced. Further, 
when the temperature of the element exceeds the Curie 
point, the polarization is released to thereby no longer 
exhibit any significant displacement. Therefore, a piezoelectric actuator capable of stably 
exhibiting a large displacement even when the temperature 
of the element is high, has been demanded in the art. 
Thus, the development of a piezoelectric ceramic having not 
only large value of piezoelectric constant d but also high 
Curie point as a starting material of the piezoelectric 
actuator has been desired in the art. The inventors have extensively and intensively studied 
the effects of the variety and proportion of added oxide on 
the composition of the
