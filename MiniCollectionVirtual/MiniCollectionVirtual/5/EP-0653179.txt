<ABSTRACT>
A separate mat for rent comprising a mat body made 
up of a mat portion having mat piles implanted on the 

front surface of a base fabric and an elastomer backing 
blended with a magnetic powder on the back surface, and 

a thick frame-like peripheral portion of an elastomer; 
and a base which supports the mat body and has a magnet 

rubber spread on a support surface. In the mat body, 
the back surface of the outer periphery of the mat 

portion and the upper surface of the peripheral frame of 
the mat are superposed one upon the other and joined 

together as a unitary structure. The base rubber is 
inserted in the back side of the mat body. Therefore, 

no step is formed between the mat body and the base yet 
the two are adhered very strongly. Besides, no wrinkles 

develop on the mat surface and homogeneous adhesion is 
accomplished. The mat is further excellent in fixing 

performance and stability, and can be easily attached or 
detached, and is very light in weight compared with the 

mats of the unitary structure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a separable mat which
may be used for rental purposes. More specifically, the
invention relates to a separable mat for rent which is
relatively light in weight, enables a mat body and a base to
be separated from each other and detachably attached
together, and permits the mat body and the base to be
intimately adhered together during the use, offering
excellently fixed performance, stability during use and
safety.Dust-control mats which are used by being laid in
porches and entrances of shops, offices and general
houses can be classified into two types, i.e., separate
mats and unitary mats.These mats have generally been used on a rent
basis; i.e., the mats are rented to the customers for a
predetermined period of time, and are then recovered,
washed, regenerated, and are rented again to the
customers.Among these mats, the separate mat has a base that
serves as an underlayer and a mat body that can be
mechanically separated from the underlayer. In a rental
service business, the mat bodies only are removed,
recovered and are delivered. Moreover, the mat bodies
only are washed and regenerated.In the case of the unitary mats, the base that
serves as an underlayer and the mat body have been
constructed as a unitary structure. In the rental
service business, therefore, the whole mat in which the
base and the mat body are constructed as a unitary
structure must be recovered and delivered. Moreover, 
the unitary mat as a whole must be washed and
regenerated.In the case of the separate mat for rent, a base
made of a rubber or the like can be used semipermanently
once it is laid. Therefore, the mat body only needs be
produced making it possible to offer many kinds of mats
at a reduced cost so that different kinds of the mats
can be used.Compared with the unitary mats, furthermore, the
mat body only needs be recovered, carried, transitted and
stored presenting such advantages that the mats are
light in weight and are not bulky, enabling the cost for
distribution to be decreased, reducing the burden of
washing, and allowing the mats to be washed and
regenerated at a low cost.The separate mat, however, requires some adhesion
mechanism between the mat and the base made of a rubber
or the like. If the adhesion mechanism does not
favorably work, the adhesive force is often lost between
the mat and the rubber base arousing such inconvenience
that the position is deviated and the mat is turned up
deteriorating the appearance. Moreover, safety is lost
for the persons who walk on it and

an elastomer backing (4) applied to the back
surface of the mat body (1,2), and wherein the backing of

the mat body is formed of an elastomer coating (4) blended
with a magnetic powder and a frame-like thick elastomer

backing sheet (3) is applied to the periphery on the back
surface of the mat body (1,2) so as to protrude inwardly and

outwardly beyond the edges of the mat body (1,2) such that
edges along the periphery of the base (5) are on the inside

of the outer peripheral edges of the elastomer backing sheet
(3).

claim 1 and a base (5) having a flat surface for supporting

the mat, at least the flat surface being formed of a magnet
rubber sheet.
A mat according to claim 1 or 2 wherein the mat
body (1,2) comprises a base fabric (1) and mat piles (2)

implanted on the base fabric and wherein the elastomer
backing (4) is applied to the back surface of the base

fabric (1) and the frame-like thick elastomer backing sheet
(3) is applied so as to protrude inwardly and outwardly

beyond the edges of the base fabric (1).
A mat according to claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein the
backing elastomer (4) of said mat body and the frame-like

thick elastomer backing sheet (3) are composed of a nitrilebutadiene
rubber.
A mat according to any preceding claim, wherein
both the backing (4) of said mat body and the magnet rubber

sheet of the base (5) contain a high molecular plasticizer.
A mat according to any preceding claim, wherein 
the elastomer of the magnet rubber sheet of said base (5) is

composed of a nitrile-butadiene rubber.
A mat according to any preceding claim, wherein
a fine rugged pattern (6) is formed on the surface of said

base on the side in use facing the ground.
A mat according to any preceding claim, wherein
said mat body (1,2) is molded by heating under the

application of pressure.
