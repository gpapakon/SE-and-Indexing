<ABSTRACT>
Thermally processable imaging elements in 
which the image is formed by imagewise heating or by 

imagewise exposure to light followed by uniform heating 
are provided with both a backing layer and an 

electroconductive layer to reduce static electricity 
effects and improve conveyance through processing 

equipment. The backing layer is an outermost layer and 
is located on the side of the support opposite to the 

imaging layer whereas the electroconductive layer is an 
inner layer and can be disposed on either side of the 

support.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to imaging 
elements and in particular to thermally processable 
imaging elements. More specifically, this invention 
relates to imaging elements comprising a thermographic 
or photothermographic layer, an electroconductive layer 
and a backing layer. Thermally processable imaging elements, 
including films and papers, for producing images by 
thermal processing are well known. These elements 
include photothermographic elements in which an image 
is formed by imagewise exposure of the element to light 
followed by development by uniformly heating the 
element. These elements also include thermographic 
elements in which an image is formed by imagewise 
heating the element. Such elements are described in, 
for example, Research Disclosure, June 1978, Item No. 
17029 and U.S. Patents 3,080,254, 3,457,075 and 
3,933,508. The aforesaid thermally processable imaging 
elements are often provided with an overcoat layer 
and/or a backing layer, with the overcoat layer being 
the outermost layer on the side of the support on which 
the imaging layer is coated and the backing layer being 
the outermost layer on the opposite side of the 
support. Other layers which are advantageously 
incorporated in thermally processable imaging elements 
include subbing layers and barrier layers. To be fully acceptable, a protective overcoat 
layer for such imaging elements should: (a) provide 
resistance to deformation of the layers of the element  
 
during thermal processing, (b) prevent or reduce loss 
of volatile components in the element during thermal 
processing, (c) reduce or prevent transfer of essential 
imaging components from one or more of the layers of 
the element into the overcoat layer during manufacture 
of the element or during storage of the element prior 
to imaging and thermal processing, (d) enable 
satisfactory adhesion of the overcoat to a contiguous 
layer of the element, and (e) be free from cracking and 
undesired marking, such as abrasion marking, during 
manufacture, storage, and processing of the element. A backing layer also serves several important 
functions which improve the overall performance of 
thermally processable imaging elements. For example, a 
backing layer serves to improve conveyance, reduce 
static electricity and eliminate formation of Newton 
Rings. A particularly preferred overcoat for 
thermally processable imaging elements is an overcoat 
comprising poly(silicic acid) as described in U.S. 
Patent 4,741,992, issued May 3, 1988.
