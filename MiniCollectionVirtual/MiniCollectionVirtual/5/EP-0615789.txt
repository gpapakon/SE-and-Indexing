<ABSTRACT>
A device for the processing of particles, especially by means of a grinding unit (W1, W2), has, downstream of the latter, a monitoring arrangement (101) for detecting a parameter corresponding to the size of the processed particles. The output signal from this monitoring arrangement is used for regulating the processing, especially for varying the grinding gap (g).

A process for processing the particles of a bulk
product, in particular for the control of a device

processing the bulk product, with at least two
surfaces capable of movement relative to one

another and forming between them a gap (g) for the
passage of the granular product which is to be

processed, whereby the product which is to be
subsequently processed is conducted past a sensor

(101), which issues, as a function of the
characteristics such as the colour, an output

signal which is used for the control of said gap
(g) by way of a comparison signal, characterised in

that

a) As a processing device, a flocculation rolling
mill (W1, W2) is fed via a feed device (fr) for

the production of flocks from the particles of
the bulk product, which has as the gap a

millbase gap (g),
b) The flock-like material which is to be processed
is brought into alignment on a predetermined

underlay (738), such as a conveyor belt or the
like,
c) The sensor (101) allocated to this underlay
(738) issues an output signal as a function of

the colour and/or size, and
d) A further sensor (401) in the area of the feed
device (fr) checks the material being introduced

and issues the comparison signal.
A process according to claim 1, characterised in
that the product which is to be processed is 

subjected to an inspection by means of at least one
photoelectric converter forming the sensor (101),

to which electromagnetic radiation can be conducted
which is reflected from the bulk or mass product

and its underlay (738), and which, as a function of
the amount of radiation received, issues an

electrical output signal.
A process according to claim 2, characterised in
that a magnitude signal is derived from the

reflected radiation which is representative of the
size of the output product, whereby this magnitude

signal forms the output signal either directly or
in derived form.
A process according to one of the foregoing claims,
characterised in that the output signal is

initially compared with a product which is provided
for the comparison of the characteristics of the

millbase (W1, W2), in particular with the size
thereof, and the differential signal obtained is

used for controlling the size of the roller gap
(g).
A system for the performance of the process in
accordance with one of the foregoing claims, with a

device for processing the bulk product with at
least two surfaces capable of movement relative to

one another and forming a gap (g) between them for
the passage of the granular product which is to be

processed, whereby a sensor (101) is provided at
the output of the device for processing the bulk

product, which issues an output signal as a
function of a characteristic, such as the colour,

of the product which is to be processed, said
output signal being capable of being conducted to a

control device (fc, sp, z) for the formation of a 
comparison signal and for controlling said gap (g),

characterised in that:

a) The device processing the bulk product has a
flocculating rolling mill (W1, W2) for the

production of flocks from the particles of the
bulk product which are fed to it via a feed

device (fr) of the flocculating rolling mill
(W1, W2), and which has as a gap a millbase gap

(g),
b) Arranged at the output of the flocculating
rolling mill (W1, W2) and following on from its

millbase gap (g) is an underlay surface (738)
for aligning the flock-like product on it,
c) The sensor (101) allocated to this underlay
(738) issues an output signal as a function of

the colour and/or size, and
d) A further sensor (401) is provided for in the
area of said feed device (fr) for checking the

material delivered to it, said sensor issuing
the comparison signal.
A system according to claim 5, characterised in
that the product which is to be processed is

capable of being conducted to at least one
photoelectric converter forming the sensor (101), a

camera in particular, to which the electromagnetic
radiation reflected from the bulk or mass product

and its underlay (738) can be conducted, and which
issues an electrical output signal as a function of

the amount of radiation received.
A system according to claim 6, characterised in
that a processor (Fp) generating a magnitude signal 

is connected downstream of the photoelectric
converter, a camera in particular, which forms the

sensor (101).
A system according to one of claims 5 to 7,
characterised in that a further sensor (401) is

arranged in front of the millbase gap (g), and that
the control device (fc, sp, z) comprises a

differential value former (5780) for the output
signals from the sensors (101, 401).
