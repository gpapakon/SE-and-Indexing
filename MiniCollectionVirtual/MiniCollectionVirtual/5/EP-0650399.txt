<ABSTRACT>
A sorting installation (1) for valuable materials is useful in particular for sorting recyclable packaging materials. In order to sort in a highly effective manner individual types of packaging materials, individual monofractions (35, 36, 37) are sorted at one or several manual sorting sections (24, 27, 28) onto a parallel collecting conveyor belt (31, 32, 33) the content of which is taken after sorting to an associated container (108, 109, 110).

Sorting plant (1) for valuable items for the purpose of
storage in a plurality of valuable item bins, in particular for

sorting reusable packaging materials, the various valuable items
being supplied on a sorting conveyor belt to a hand sorting

section (24, 27, 28) with manual sorting workstations, which
sorting conveyor belt is associated with at least one collecting

and conveying device (32, 33), the collecting and conveying
device (31, 32, 33) being associated with a plurality of

collecting bins (101 to 107) and wherein the mentioned
collecting and conveying device (32, 33) can load a specific

collecting bin (101 to 107) as desired according to valuable
item fraction.
Sorting plant according to claim 1, characterised in that
the collecting device (31 to 33) is formed as a valuable item

collecting channel running parallel to the sorting conveyor belt
and the hand sorting section (24, 27, 28) and the content of the

valuable item collecting channel can be supplied as a
monofraction (35 to 37) to an associated valuable item bin (101

to 107).
Sorting plant according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that the collecting device (31 to 33) is formed as a mechanical

collecting conveyor belt (31 to 33), which leads to various
valuable item bins (101 to 107).
Sorting plant according to one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that at least one preliminary or intermediate

storage device (46) is associated with the hand sorting section
(24, 27, 28) and/or the collecting device (31 to 33), which 

preliminary or intermediate storage device receives at least a
monofraction (35 to 37) during the processing and emptying

period of the collecting device (31 to 33) in particular.
Sorting plant according to claim 4, characterised in that
the preliminary storage device (46) is formed as a reversing

flap (44) to two collecting conveyor belts running parallel.
Sorting plant according to claim 4, characterised in that
the preliminary storage device (46) is formed as a swivelling

collecting channel or star wheel (47), the chamber content of
which falls onto the collecting conveyor belt (31 to 33) when

swivelled or rotated.
Sorting plant according to claim 4, characterised in that
the preliminary storage device (46) is formed as a star feeder

(47, 52) with horizontal axis of rotation (50), the chamber
content of which can be supplied to a mechanical or pneumatic

conveying device (31 to 33 or 53) upon a rotational movement.
Sorting plant according to claim 4, characterised in that
the preliminary storage device (46) is formed as an upright star

feeder or drum magazine with vertical axis of rotation, the
chambers (49) of which serve to receive a monofraction (35 to

37), only one chamber being opened at the bottom for
intermittent emptying.
Sorting plant according to claim 4, characterised in that
the preliminary or intermediate storage device (46) is formed as

buffer boxes (108 to 110) associated directly with the hand
sorting section (24, 27, 28) for the purpose of receiving a

monofraction (105, 107, 111) in each case, and in that one 
buffer box in each case is emptied onto the collecting device

(31 to 33) preferably only after the conclusion of a plurality
of sorting cycles of other monofractions.
Sorting plant according to claim 9, characterised in that
the buffer boxes (108 to 110) serve to receive monofractions,

which occur only to a small extent in the mixed fractions.
Sorting plant according to one of claims 1 to 10,
characterised in that the collecting devices (31 to 33) are

allocated to the specific bins (101 to 107) by means of
controllable outflow flaps.
Sorting plant according to one of claims 1 to 11,
characterised in that the collecting devices (31 to 33) formed

as collecting conveying belts are allocated to the associated
bins (101 to 107) for the respective monofraction (31 to 37) by

a longitudinal forward movement of the collecting conveyor belt
(31 to 33) in such a way that the belt end (39) is arranged over

the associated bin (101 to 107).
Sorting plant according to one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that a large number and in particular five to
ten bins (101 to 107) are arranged adjacent to one another for

the monofractions (35 to 37), in that a collecting conveyor belt
(31 to 33) is arranged over the bins (101 to 107), and in that

one of the two end regions (39) of the collecting conveyor belt
(31 to 33) reaches over the desired bin (101 to 107) as a result

of longitudinal forward movement of the collecting conveyor belt
(31 to 33) in both longitudinal directions. 
Sorting device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that a conveying device (43) is connected

downstream of the collecting bins (101 to 107), which conveying
device guides the desired monofraction (35 to 37) to a packing

press.
Sorting plant according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that a plurality of sorting belts are provided

as hand sorting sections (24, 27, 28), with which collecting
