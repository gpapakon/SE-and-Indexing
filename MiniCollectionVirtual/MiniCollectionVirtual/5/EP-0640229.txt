<ABSTRACT>
An enhanced parallel port interface increases the bandwidth of a standard parallel port connector while at the same time maintaining backward compatibility with a standard parallel port interface. In order to increase the data transfer rate, the software overhead is substantially reduced by hardware generated signals. As such, the desirability of using a parallel port bus expansion is greatly increased.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to computer systems 
and more particularly to an enhanced parallel port (EPP) 
interface which allows for increased performance and bandwidth 
of a standard parallel port connector while at the 
same time maintaining compatibility with the existing 
parallel port interface which includes hardware that 
enables the software overhead for data transfers to be 
substantially reduced thus increasing the system performance 
to enable it to be utilized for bus expansion. IBM type PC/AT compatible personal computers are 
provided with a relatively limited number of input/output 
(I/O) expansion slots to accommodate various I/O devices 
including additional memory storage devices, tape backup 
systems, network interface circuits and the like. In order 
to support a trend of an ever increasing need for expansion 
capabilities for additional I/O devices, based upon, for 
example, increased consumer demand for various I/O devices, 
such as CD-ROMS, various solutions are known. For example, 
additional I/O devices can be connected to existing expansion 
slots within personal computers. If existing expansion 
slots are unavailable, expansion buses are known for 
providing additional sets of I/O slots. Both IBM type 
PC/AT compatible and non-compatible (e.g., PCMCIO) expansion 
buses are known. With such an arrangement, the addition of the I/O 
devices, whether supported by existing expansion slots or 
additional expansion slots created by an expansion bus is 
relatively cumbersome and generally requires the services 
of a computer technician which adds to the overall cost of  
 
adding an I/O device. In order to avoid such problems, 
standard parallel ports have been known to be used for 
expansion capabilities. Although standard parallel ports 
are undoubtedly the simplest and most cost-effective solution, 
there are other problems associated with using a 
parallel port in such an application. More particularly, 
parallel ports are known to be a relatively slow interface. 
In particular, parallel ports were developed in the past 
primarily to support printers whose maximum block transfer 
rate is about 500 kilobits/sec - assuming no data compression. 
The block transfer rate is limited by the software 
overhead required to support data transfers to such 
devices. For example, 4 to 6 instructions are typically 
required for transferring data. In particular, a typical 
transfer may be as follows: 
1) write data to data port, 2) assert a strobe signal, 3) check the busy input, 4) if the
