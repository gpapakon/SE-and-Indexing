<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a bioremediation 
process of pollutants. The present process utilizes an 
adsorbent coated biologically active support for use in 
biological remediation processes for pollutants, for 
example, in industrial and municipal waste waters and by-products, 
and to a bioreactor comprising the biologically 
active support. There are various chemical and biological processes 
to remediate pollutants. Among these, bioremediation is 
an effective and highly desirable approach. Quite 
broadly, pollutant-remediating microorganisms metabolize 
pollutants to simple chemical structures, sometimes 
degrading the pollutants completely to carbon dioxide and 
water in an aerobic process, or to methane in an 
anaerobic process. Various bioremediation processes are known. For 
example, US-A-4 634 672 describes biologically 
active compositions for purifying waste water and air 
which comprises a polyurethane hydrogel containing (i) 
surface active coal having a specific surface according 
to BET of above 50 m2/g, a polymer having cationic groups 
and cells which have enzymatic activity and are capable 
of growth. US-A-4 681 852 describes a process 
for biological purification of waste water and/or air by 
contacting the water or air with the biologically active 
composition of US-A-4 634 672. The 
experimental examples of these patents indicate that the 
process is not effective for reducing contaminant 
concentrations in the effluent strain to less than 44 
parts per million (ppm).  
 Rehm and coworkers have further refined the use of 
activated carbon in the aerobic oxidation of phenolic 
materials by using microorganisms immobilized on granular 
carbon as a porous biomass support system. Utilizing the 
propensity of microorganisms to grow on and remain 
attached to a surface, Rehm used a granular activated 
carbon support of high surface area (1300 m2/g) to which 
cells were attached within the macropores of the support 
and on its surface, as a porous biomass support system in 
a loop reactor for phenol removal. H.M. Ehrhardt and 
H.J. Rehm, Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol., 21, 32-6 (1985). 
The resulting "immobilized" cells exhibited phenol 
tolerance up to a level in the feed of about 15 g/L, 
whereas free cells showed a tolerance not more than 1.5 
g/L. It was postulated that the activated carbon 
operated like a "buffer and depot" in protecting the 
immobilized microorganisms by absorbing toxic phenol 
concentrations and letting low quantities of the absorbed 
phenol free for gradual
