<ABSTRACT>
An improved trench capacitor employes an N-type 
switchable plate formed in a P-type substrate for 

holding charge at either zero volts or a positive 
voltage and a P-type ground plate that fills in a 

trench around a memory cell, so that P-type dopant 
diffuses through a thin oxide insulator to form a 

channel stop and a pinhole short through the oxide is 
self-healing by the formation ofa reverse-biased P-N 

diode that cuts off the flow of current through the 
pinhole.

<DESCRIPTION>
The field of the invention is the fabrication of vertical 
capacitors formed in the wall of a trench extending into a 
substrate. The use of trench capacitors for saving space in 
integrated circuits has been studied for some years. A 
convenient summary is an article by K. Minegishi et al. 
entitled "A submicron CMOS Megabit Level Dynamic RAM 
Technology Using Doped Face Trench Capacitor Cell", IEDM '83. Reference is also made to WO-A-8103241 which discloses a 
dynamic RAM using trench capacitors. The art has long sought a practical method of saving 
space in DRAMs and other integrated circuits that employ 
capacitors by orienting the capacitors vertically. There have 
been considerable practical difficulties blocking the 
implementation of this approach, including problems associated 
with yield that are related to short circuits through what is 
necessarily a thin and relatively irregular insulating oxide 
insulation and also to problems associated with capacitor 
discharge through parasitic channels formed within the 
substrate (not necessarily at the surface) that tend to 
discharge trench capacitors. This invention is directed at an 
improved method of forming trench capacitors that reduces the 
aforementioned problems. According to one aspect of the invention there is 
provided a method of fabricating a trench capacitor in an 
integrated circuit containing a plurality of circuit elements 
formed in a semiconductor substrate having a substrate 
conductivity type, comprising the steps of: 
   forming a protection layer on said substrate; 
   cutting an implant aperture having first and second 
aperture dimensions along first and second axes in said 
substrate, in a predetermined location in said substrate 
dimensions along said first and second axes, through said 
protective layer to said substrate;  
 
   implanting a predetermined dose of ions of conductivity 
type opposite to said substrate conductivity type; 
   diffusing said dose of ions into said substrate by 
heating said substrate to a predetermined temperature for a 
predetermined time such that a substantial concentration of 
said ions of said opposite conductivity type extends a 
predetermined distance from said implant aperture, whereby 
that portion of said dose of ions extending in said substrate 
below a predetermined capacitor place location forms a plate 
conductive region extending downwardly into said substrate 
along a third axis and having first, second and third plate 
dimensions along said first, second and third axes;
