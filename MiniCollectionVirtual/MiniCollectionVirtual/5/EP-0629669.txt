<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to cobalt-containing 
iron oxide pigments, a process for producing the pigments 
and a magnetic recording medium containing the pigments. 
More in particular, it relates to cobalt-containing iron 
oxide pigments having a high coercive force, an excellent 
S.F.D. (Switching Field Distribution), and small 
temperature- and time-dependence (an excellent temperature 
stability and an excellent stability independent on the 
time) of the coercive force, a process for producing the 
pigments, and a magnetic recording medium containing the 
pigments with extremely small print through (extremely 
small deterioration with passage of time upon transfer) and 
extremely small long-term erasability (extremely 
small deterioration with passage of time upon erasure). Known processes for producing iron oxides having a 
high coercive force in the prior art comprise essentially a 
modification of iron oxides with cobalt. The processes can 
be generally classified into two groups. Namely, a method 
of mass doping of an iron oxide (so-called doping method) 
and a method of coating on the surface of the iron oxide 
(so-called epitaxial method or coating method).  
 Surface-coating iron oxide pigments are advantageous, 
for example, in that they are free from deterioration with 
passage of time upon transfer and deterioration with 
passage of time upon erasure, excellent in magnetic 
stability, and of small temperature-dependence and time-dependence 
of the coercive force. However, in order to 
obtain a high coercive force, since a large amount of 
cobalt coated on the surface of iron oxide is required, 
cobalt costs are high and the resultant coercive force is 
relatively small as compared with the amount of cobalt 
used, which is economically disadvantageous. In DE-A 2,235,383, iron oxide is epitaxially coated 
with cobalt to obtain a coercive force yield of about 4.5 
kA/m·Co wt%. The coercive force yield is calculated as: 
coercive force yield = (Hc - 27.8)/Co wt% . In this case, 
27.8 kA/m as the coercive strength of the analogously Co-free 
iron oxide is subtracted as compensation. 
Further, coercive force yields of 9.9, 6.6, 9.5, 
5.3 or 6.7 kA/m·Co wt% are obtained by calculation for 
analogously epitaxially coated products described in most 
preferred examples in DE-A 2,629,931, DE-A 2,639,250, DE-A 
3,017,525, DE-A 3,017,652 and DE-A 3,101,834. According to 
other methods as described in DE-A3,631,194 and DE-A 
3,843,848, coercive force yields of 9 - 12 kA/m·Co wt% are 
obtained.
