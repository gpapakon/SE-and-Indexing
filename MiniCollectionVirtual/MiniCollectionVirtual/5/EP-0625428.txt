<ABSTRACT>
A thermal transfer dye-image-receiving sheet useful 
for producing clear dye images having a high evenness in 

color density, includes a resin coating layer formed on 
at least one surface of a substrate paper sheet, 

comprising a thermoplastic resin, for example, 
polyolefin, and having a modulus of elasticity in flexure 

of less than 7,000 kg/cm² as determined in accordance 
with Japanese Industrial Standard K 7203, and a dye-image-receiving 

layer formed on the resin-coating layer 
and comprising a dye-receiving resin.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a thermal-transfer 
dye-image-receiving sheet. More particularly, 
the present invention relates to a thermal-transfer dye-image-receiving 
sheet capable of producing clear images 
having a very even color density when used in a dye-image-thermal-transfer 
printer. Currently, development of a thermal image-transfer 
printer capable of producing high quality 
colored images, especially a dye-thermal-transfer printer 
is progressing rapidly. In the dye-thermal-transfer 
printer, colored images or pictures are formed by 
superposing thermally transferred yellow, magenta and 
cyan colored images or pictures in the form of a number 
of dots, to produce continuous tone full-color images or 
pictures having a continuous hue and color density. In a 
dye-image-thermal-transfer printing operation, an ink 
sheet composed of a base film and a sublimating yellow, 
magenta or cyan dye layer formed on the base film is 
superposed on a dye-image-receiving sheet composed of a 
substrate sheet and a dye-image-receiving layer formed on 
the substrate sheet in such a manner that the sublimating 
dye layer of the ink sheet comes into contact with the 
dye-image-receiving layer of the dye-image-receiving 
sheet, and the ink sheet is locally heated by a heat 
supplied by a thermal head in the printer. The amount of 
the heat is continuously controlled in accordance with 
electric signals corresponding to the images or pictures 
to be printed, and portions of the sublimating dye ink in 
the dye layer are thermally transferred to the dye-image-receiving 
layer to provide colored images in a 
predetermined pattern and having a predetermined color  
 
density. It is known that to print high quality colored 
images on a dye-image-receiving sheet at a high speed 
using a dye-thermal-transfer printer, a biaxially 
oriented multilayer film comprising, as a principal 
component, a thermoplastic resin, for example, polyolefin 
resins, and having a plurality of voides formed therein, 
is used as a substrate sheet for the thermal-transfer 
dye-image-receiving sheet. A conventional thermal-transfer 
dye-image-receiving sheet, which will be 
referred to as a dye-image-receiving sheet hereinafter, 
has a dye-image-receiving layer formed on the above-mentioned 
substrate sheet and comprises, as a principal 
component, a dye-receiving thermoplastic resin. Where a 
biaxially oriented multilayer thermoplastic resin film is 
used as a substrate sheet, the resultant dye-image-receiving 
sheet is advantageous in
