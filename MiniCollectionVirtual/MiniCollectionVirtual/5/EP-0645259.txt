A process for transferring IR dyes from a transfer to a 
plastic-coated paper by diffusion or sublimation by means of 

an energy source, which comprises using a transfer on which 
there is or are located one or more IR dyes selected from the 

group consisting of naphthalocyanines of the formula I
