<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed to a new use for a 
group of known 6-halo-tryptophan of formula (Ia) and 4-halo-kynurenine 

derivatives of formula (Ib) for the preparation 
of a pharmaceutical composition as excitatory amino acid 

antagonists, for use in the treatment of disease states such 
as epilepsy, anxiety and stroke.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a new use for a group of
known 6-halo-tryptophan and 4-halo-kynurenine derivatives for
the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition as excitatory
amino acid antagonists, for use in the treatment of disease
states such as epilepsy, anxiety and stroke. In EP-A 421 946
published on April 10, 1991 and designating the contracting
states DE, FR and GB, the use of 6-chlorotryptophan as an NMDA
antagonist is disclosed. The present invention pertains to the
following known compounds which are excitatory amino acid antagonists:

   (all contracting states except DE, FR and GB)
and
 
in which Hal is represented by a halogen atom, or a
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.As used in this application:
a) the term "halogen" refers to a fluorine, chlorine, or
bromine atom;b) the term "pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts"
refers to either an acid addition or a basic addition salt.The compounds of Formula Ia and Ib can exist
as either pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts or
as pharmaceutically acceptable basic addition salts. These
compounds may also exist as zwitterions.The expression "pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition
salts" is intended to apply to any non-toxic organic or
inorganic acid addition salt of the base compounds
represented by Formula Ia or Ib or any of its
intermediates. Illustrative inorganic acids which form
suitable salts include hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulphuric,
and phosphoric acid and acid metal salts such as sodium
monohydrogen orthophosphate, and potassium hydrogen sulfate.
Illustrative organic acids which form suitable salts include
the mono-, di-, and tricarboxylic acids. Illustrative of
such acids are for example, acetic, glycolic, lactic,
pyruvic, malonic, succinic, glutaric, fumaric, malic,
tartaric, citric, ascorbic, maleic, hydroxymaleic, benzoic,
hydroxy-benzoic, phenylacetic, cinnamic, salicyclic, 2-phenoxy-benzoic,
p-toluenesulfonic acid, and sulfonic acids
such as methane sulfonic acid and 2-hydroxyethane sulfonic
acid. Such salts can exist in either a hydrated or
substantially anhydrous form. In general, the acid addition 
salts of these compounds are soluble in water and various
hydrophilic organic solvents, and which in comparison to
their free base forms, generally demonstrate higher melting
points.The expression "pharmaceutically acceptable basic
addition salts" is intended to apply to any non-toxic
organic or inorganic basic addition salts of the compounds
represented by Formula Ia or Ib or any of its
intermedi
