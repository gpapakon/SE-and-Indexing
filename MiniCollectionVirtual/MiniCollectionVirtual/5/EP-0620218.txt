<ABSTRACT>
This invention refers to heterocyclic compounds of general formula 

and their pharmacologically accepted salts. 
The derivatives described in this invention are active in the gastro-intestinal 
apparatus; in particular, they have prokinetic effects, in other words they create 

specific stimulation on gastro-intestinal motility, facilitating the passage of the 
contents of the alimentary tract, and possess anti-emetic qualities, without side 

effects involving the central nervous system.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention refers to the synthesis of 2,3-dihydro-4(1H)-quinazolinones having 
favourable effects on gastro-intestinal motility, with prokinetic and antiemetic 
properties and without side effects involving the central nervous system. The principal derivatives with prokinetic properties used in therapy belong to the 
benzamide chemical class and their parent is metoclopramide, of the formula 
 
described in the US patent 3,177,252, which stimulates the motility of the upper 
gastro-intestinal tract with a mechanism which probably implies interaction with 
receptors 5HT4, as reported by Brunnengr√§ber R. et al., Pharma. Zeitung, 35, 
9-18, 1991 and by Turconi M. et al., Drugs of the Future, 16, 1011, 1991, and 
has both central and peripheral antagonistic activity on the dopaminergic  
 
receptors D2, as reported by King F.D. and Senger G.J., Ann. Rep. Med. 
Chem. 23, 201, 1990. Over the last few years a large number of derivatives of metoclopramide, 
presenting structural modifications in the lateral chain, have been studied with 
the aim of leaving the prokinetic activity unaltered, though eliminating 
antagonism to the dopaminergic receptors. The antagonist action on these 
receptors, considered secondary in disorders of gastro-intestinal motility, seems 
to be of particular importance due to a series of undesirable side effects caused 
by drugs in use, such as extrapyramidal motor symptoms and high levels of 
prolactin in the blood. The product currently used in therapy which best fulfils these pharmacological 
requirements is cisapride, with the formula 
 
whose synthesis and pharmacological properties are described in the patent EP 
0076530 and in Drugs of the Future, 13, 676, 1988. Craig and Clarke, Brit. J. Pharm., 102, 563-564, 1991, report that cisapride 
stimulates intestinal motility through interaction with serotoninergic receptors 
5HT4 and has practically no antagonist property of the dopamine receptors, of 
cholinesterase inhibition or direct parasympathomimetic activity.  
 King F.D. and Senger G.J., Ann. Rep. Med. Chem. 23, 202, 1990, report the 
structures of several other derivatives, structurally modified in lateral chain with 
respect to metoclopramide, and having prokinetic activity such as BRL 20627, 
dazopride, clebopride, which, unlike cisapride, show a fair amount of activity on 
the dopaminergic receptors D2. It is also known from the state of the art that some derivatives similar to those 
mentioned have a receptorial selectivity on the receptors 5HT3 with effects on
