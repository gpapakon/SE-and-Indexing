<ABSTRACT>
On a rotor (6;8) which is fixed to a rotatable rotating shaft 
(4), a plurality 

of permanent magnets (22A-22H) are disposed along the 
direction of rotation such that 

the same magnetic pole type thereof face outward. In the same way, 
balancers (20A-20H) are disposed on the rotor for 

balancing the rotation of this 
rotor. Each of the permanent magnets is obliquely arranged with 

respect to 
the radial direction line of the rotor. At the outer periphery of the 

rotor, an electromagnet (12;14) is disposed facing this rotor, with this 
electromagnet intermittently energized based on the rotation of 

the rotor. 
According to the magnetic rotating apparatus of the present 

invention, 
rotational energy can be efficiently obtained from permanent 

magnets. This 
is made possible by minimizing as much as possible 

current supplied to the 
electromagnets, so that only a required amount of electrical energy is 

supplied to the electromagnets.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magnetic rotating apparatus, and 
more particularly, to a magnetic rotating apparatus which utilizes 
repulsive forces produced between a permanent magnet and an electromagnet. In a conventional electric motor, an armature as a rotor consists of 
turns of wires, and electric field as a stator consists of a permanent 
magnet. In such a conventional electric motor, however, current must be 
usually supplied to windings of the armature which is rotated. When the 
current is supplied, heat is generated, which gives rise to the problem 
that not much driving force is efficiently generated. This, in turn, gives 
rise to the problem that the magnetic forces cannot be efficiently obtained 
from the permanent magnet. In addition, in the conventional electric motor, since the armature 
is so constructed as consisting of the windings, the moment of inertia 
cannot be made very high, so that enough torque cannot be obtained. To overcome the above-described problems of such the conventional 
electric motor, the inventor proposed, in Japanese Patent Publication No. 
61868/1993 (U.S. Patent No. 4,751,486 and EP-A-256,132) a magnetic rotating apparatus in 
which a plurality of permanent magnets are disposed along two 
rotors, respectively, at a predetermined angle, and in which an 
electromagnet is disposed at one of the rotors. In a generally constructed conventional electric motor, there is a 
limit as to hcw much the efficiency of energy conversion can be increased. 
In addition, the torque of the electric motor cannot be made high enough. 
For the above reasons, hitherto, various improvements have been made on 
existing electric motors, without any success in producing an electric 
motor so constructed that has provided satisfactory characteristics. In the magnetic rotating apparatus disclosed in Japanese Patent 
Publication No. 61868/1993 (U.S. Patent No. 4,751,486) a pair of rotors is 
rotated. Therefore, it is necessary for each of the rotors to have high 
precision, and in addition, measures must be taken for easier rotation 
control.  
 In USA 4,642,534, on which the pre-characterizing part of claim 1 is 
based, a rotor has permanent magnets on its outer peripheral surface which 
co-operate with an electro-magnet on the stator. A magnetically operated 
switch also on the stator energises and de-energises the electromagnet in 
synchronism with the passage of the magnetic poles as the rotor turns. In view of the above-described problems, the object of the present invention 
is
