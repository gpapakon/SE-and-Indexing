<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for 
producing 1,2-benzisothiazol-3-ones. More particularly, 
the present invention relates to a method for producing 
1,2-benzisothiazol-3-ones directly from 
2-(alkylthio)benzamides. 1,2-benzisothiazol-3-ones are 
compounds useful as antibacterial agents and antifungal 
agents. There are several methods known for producing 
1,2-benzisothiazol-3-ones, including the following ones. 
(C) Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn., 55, 1183-1187 (1982) 
In the above method, 2-(methylthio)benzamide is 
produced from 2-(methylthio)benzoylchloride; oxidized 
with periodic acid to 2-(methylsulfinyl)benzamide; and 
cyclized in the presence of thionyl chloride to yield a 
1,2-benzisothiazol-3-one. 
(D) Ger. Offen. 3500577 (1986)  
 
In the above method, a desired 
1,2-benzisothiazol-3-one may be obtained using 
thiosalicylic acid as a starting material and sodium 
hydroxide as a cycling agent in the final process. 
(E) J. Org. Chem. 40(14), 2029-2032 (1975) 
In the above method, a desired 1,2-benzisothiazol-3-one 
is obtained using thiosalicylic acid as a starting 
material and a strong base in the final cyclization 
process. However, these conventional methods have the 
following drawbacks:  
 In Method (C), a desired 1,2-benzisothiazol-3-one is 
synthesized in two steps, that is, 
2-(methylthio)benzamide is oxidized to 
2-(methylsulfinyl)benzamide, which is then cyclized in 
the presence of thionyl chloride. This method needs use 
of periodic acid, a dangerous and expensive substance. Method (D) requires expensive thiosalicylic acid as 
the starting material, a strong base for cyclization, and 
involves many reaction steps. Therefore, this method is 
not satisfactory for industrial use. Also, Method (E) uses expensive thiosalicylic acid 
as the starting material and a strong base for 
cyclization, and involves many reaction steps, and, 
therefore, is not suitable for industrial use. As stated above, all known methods require more than 
one reaction steps to produce 1,2-benzisothiazol-3-ones 
from 2-(alkylthio)benzamides, and are not satisfactory 
for production on an industrial scale. WO-A-94/20479 (published after the priority date of 
the present application) discloses N-(Î²-branched alkyl)-1,2-benzisothiazolin-3-ones 
having two or more carbon 
atoms in the alkyl side chain and processes for their 
production. The compounds are said to be useful as paint 
film fungicides. Accordingly, in view of the above problems, an 
object of the present invention is to provide a method 
for
