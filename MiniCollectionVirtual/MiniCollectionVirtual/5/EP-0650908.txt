<ABSTRACT>
Unit for receiving refuse for underground storage, comprising a pit (6), a vessel (4) which can be arranged therein, this vessel being surmounted by a hollow column (8b, 8d) for receiving the refuse and guiding it towards the vessel, handling means (20, 22) making it possible, in particular, to lift the vessel from the pit and to lower it into it. According to the invention, retractable means (26) for mechanical protection of the vessel, of its column and/or of the area around the unit, when the said vessel is being handled, are also provided in order to retract when the vessel is manoeuvred in the pit and to take up a protective position, substantially at ground level or above it when the vessel is out of the pit. Application to the selective collection of refuse in an urban environment.

Underground refuse storage unit, comprising: 

at least one pit (6) provided in the ground, 
at least one vessel (4) suitable for placing in the 
pit, 
at least one hollow column (8a, 8b, 8c, 8d) standing 
above the pit when the vessel is placed therein, to receive 

refuse and to guide it inside the vessel with which the 
said column communicates, 
retractable means (26, 26', 28) for mechanical 
protection of the vessel (4), its column (8a, 8b, 8c, 8d) 

and/or the surrounds of the unit (1) during handling of the 
said vessel, and 
means (20, 22; 32, 38) for handling the vessel and 
manoeuvring the said retractable protection means, in 

order, respectively: 

to raise the vessel from the pit, manoeuvre it 
out, or lower it into the pit, and 
to retract the protection means into an inactive 
position, allowing the vessel to pass, when the latter is 

manoeuvred into the pit (6), and bring them into the active 
protection position, substantially at ground level or above 

it, at least when the vessel is out of the pit, the said 
protection means comprising a plate (28) extending across 

the pit (6) to which it closes off access when the vessel 
is raised out of the pit. 
Unit according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the handling and manoeuvring means (20, 22; 33, 38) 

comprise: 

on the one hand, lifting means (22) arranged on the 
vessel (4) and arranged to co-operate with a cable or 

equivalent (20) for manoeuvring the vessel into or out of 
the pit by means of a crane, and  

 
on the other hand, means (32, 38) for manoeuvring 
the said protection means (26, 26', 28) operatively linked 

to the movement of the vessel, in order to: 

cause the said protection means to be shifted to 
their said active position at the same time as the vessel 

is raised by way of its lifting means (20, 22), 
and cause them to be retracted into the inactive 
position at the same time as the vessel descends into the 

pit by way of the said lifting means. 
Unit according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, characterized 
in that the said protection means additionally 

comprise a balustrade (26, 26') raised above the ground 
when the vessel is raised out of its pit (6) and retracted 

substantially parallel to the ground or below ground, out 
of the pit or substantially parallel to the raised walls 

(6a) which limit it laterally, when the vessel (4) ascends 
or descends in the pit. 
Unit according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the said protection means (26, 26', 28) 

retract into the pit in the inactive position and are 
retained in this position by the said vessel bearing on 

them, so that it is the weight of the vessel which thus 
retains the said protection means. 
Unit according to any one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the said protection means (26, 26', 

28) are capable of sliding along the pit (6) with the 
vessel (4), under the control of the said manoeuvring means 

(32, 34, 38), in order to descend when the vessel is 
lowered and to move back up to the surface when the vessel 

is raised again. 
Unit according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the plate (28) is arranged 

beneath the vessel (4) in order to form beneath it a base 
plate which is retractable substantially vertically. 
Unit according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the plate (28) bears on its  

 
upper face and close to its periphery at least one raised 

wall (44). 
Unit according to any one of Claims 3 to 7, 
characterized in that the balustrade (26, 26') varies in 

height in order to facilitate the positioning of the 
vessel. 
Unit according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that it comprises a plurality of 

vessels (4) arranged close to one another, the columns (8a, 
8b, 8c, 8d) of the said vessels being grouped when the 

vessels are placed in their pits, separating walls (46), 
erected on the ground between the pits (6) and forming 

angles between them, being interposed between the said 
columns, the separating walls being higher towards their 

said angles. 
Unit according to any one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that it comprise
s a plurality of vessels 
(4) arranged close to one another and the columns (8a, 8b, 

8c, 8d) of which are grouped when the said vessels are 
placed in their pits, the said retractable protection means 

(26, 26', 28) including, on the same side as the area in 
which the columns are grouped, at least one corner wall 

(31, 44) raised substantially in the shape of an angle 
piece of varying height.
