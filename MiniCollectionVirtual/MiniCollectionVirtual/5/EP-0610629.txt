<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to curable
organopolysiloxane compositions which are both photo-curable
and room-temperature-curable.It is well known that organopolysiloxanes, when
heated in the presence of an organic peroxide, become
elastic silicone rubber products which are excellent in
heat resistance, cold resistance, weatherability and electrical
properties. Among such organopolysiloxanes are
those which are curable by irradiation with light in the
presence of a photoinitiator.For instance, Japanese Patent Publication (KOKOKU)
52-40334 (1977) and Japanese Pre-examination Patent Publication
(KOKAI) 60-104158 (1985) disclose ultraviolet (UV)-curable
type organopolysiloxane compositions which comprise
a vinyl group-containing polysiloxane and a mercapto
group-containing polysiloxane and which give cured products
through photo radical addition reactions.Also, Japanese Patent Publication (KOKOKU) 53-36515
(1978) and Japanese Pre-examination Patent Publication
(KOKAI) 60-215009 (1985) disclose photo-curable type
organopolysiloxane compositions which comprise an acryloxy
group (-OCOCH=CH2) containing polysiloxane and a 
sensitizer and which give cured products when irradiated
with light.However, the above-mentioned compositions containing
a vinyl group-containing polysiloxane and a mercapto
group-containing polysiloxane have the problems of odor
and metal-corroding property both ascribable to the mercapto
group, and are thereby limited in application.On the other hand, the above-mentioned compositions
comprising an acryloxy group-containing polysiloxane
and a sensitizer have the problem that, in order to obtain
rubber-like elastic products, the acryloxy group-containing
polysiloxane must be or comprise a linear
polysiloxane with a high molecular weight. When such
polysiloxane is used, the amount of acryloxy groups located
at terminal ends is very small on a relative basis,
leading to a lowered curability. In addition, these compositions
have the drawback that their surface portions
exposed to air are hardly cured, because of inhibition by
oxygen. Of this type of compositions, therefore, only
those containing a polysiloxane with a relatively high
acryloxy group content and intended to form resinous cured
products have been put to practical use; those for giving
rubber-like elastic products have not yet been put to
practical use.Besides, although the photo-curable
organopolysiloxane compositions as above mentioned are
capable of speedy curing by irradiation with UV rays and
are advantageous over conventional
