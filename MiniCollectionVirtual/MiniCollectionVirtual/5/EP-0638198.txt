Device for holding and positioning intervening tools
onto nuclear reactor vessel cover adaptors and intended

to be placed onto an inspection area of the said cover,
the said device comprising a carriage (6) carrying at

least one tool as well as means for positioning the said
carriage in rotation and in translation, which are

disposed upon the said inspection area when the device
is in use, the means for positioning in translation

comprising at least one transverse rail (12), the
carriage (6) being provided with means (9, 11, 15) for

its displacement upon the said transverse rail (12) and
the means for positioning in rotation comprising a

circular rail (19) onto which the transverse rail (12)
is movably mounted, a radial arm (21) fastened with one

end to the said transverse rail, the other end of the
radial arm (21) being movably mounted onto the circular

rail (19) as well as drive means (20, 23) insuring the
rotation of the said radial arm (21), which rotation

results in the rotation of the transverse rail (12) on
the circular rail (19), the said carriage and the said

positioning means permitting the displacement of the
said tool in the space lying between the internal wall

of the cover and the inspection area.
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that it
comprises means mounted for rotation onto the said

carriage (6) for tilting the said tool with respect to
the said carriage (6) and for placing it in a position

substantially parallel or substantially perpendicular to
the said transverse rail (12). 
Device according to one of claims 1 or 2,
characterized in that it comprises means for the rising

or the lowering of the said tool with respect to the
said carriage (6).
Device according to one of claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the carriage supports a bracket

(26, 46).
Device according to claim 4, characterized in that
the tilting means are constituted by an operating shaft

(40) which rotates a reducer (43) made fast to the frame
(7) of the carriage and itself rotating a gear (44)

connected to the bracket.
Device according to claim 5, characterized in that
the operating shaft is replaced with a motor-reducer

(57).
Device according to one of claims 4 to 6,
characterized in that the bracket is constituted by an

outer guide column (27) and an inner coaxial column (28)
supporting at least one tool (29, 30).
Device according to claim 7, characterized in that
the means for the upward or downward motion of the said

tool (29, 30) are constituted by means insuring the
translational movement of the inner column (28) with

respect to the outer column (27) which is stationary
with respect to the carriage (6). 
Device according to claim 8, characterized in that
the means insuring the translation are constituted by

rollers (31) placed between the inner column (28) and
the outer column (27) and by a motor-reducer (32) made

fast to the frame (7) of the carriage (6), driving a
pinion (33) connected to for rotation with the axle (9)

of the carriage (6) onto which is keyed a bevel gear
(35) insuring a counter-motion with means (36) connected

to for rotation with a screw having the same axis as the
columns and which is in engagement with a nut (38)

connected to the inner column (28), the rotary movement
of the screw (37) thus insuring the translational

movement of the inner column (28) with respect to the
outer column (27).
Device according to one of claims 4 to 6,
characterized in that the bracket (46) is constituted by

a jack (47).
Device according to claim 10, characterized in that
the cylinder (48) of the jack is made fast to a ring

(49) supported by two columns (50) disposed along one
diameter, and the ring (49) may turn about two axes at

right angles to each other through the medium of two
sets of journal pins (52, 53).
Device according to claim 11, characterized in that
the ring (49) is supported by the columns (50) through

the medium of elastic means (51).
Device according to one of claims 10 to 12,
characterized in that the lower portion of the cylinder

(48) exhibits a base (56) which is pivotally connected 
onto the cylinder (48) through the medium of a ball-and-socket

joint.
Device according to one of claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the carriage (6) supports a

robotized telemanipulator unit (63).
Device according to one of claims 1 to 14,
characterized in that the means for rotary and

translational positioning comprise an encoder for
following the displacement of the said carriage (6).
Device according to claim 15, characterized in that
there are provided two optical sightings disposed

according two perpendicular directions and ensuring a
precise positioning of the said carriage (6).
