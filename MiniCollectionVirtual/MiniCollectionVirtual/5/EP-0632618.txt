<ABSTRACT>
A supervisory system for a network of 
communications stations in which a response to a query to 

one station may be received and interpreted by a plurality 
of other stations in the network. Upon receipt of a 

command from a master station, a slave station sends a 
responsive signal that includes the identity of the 

command. Each master station monitors the network and 
keeps track of the status of each slave station by 

updating its status records upon receipt of one of the 
responsive signals containing the command identity. Each 

master station operates independently and all of the 
stations may be master stations. The multiple master 

stations may each attempt to exert control over the slave 
stations in the network.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a method
and system for controlling slave station activities in a
communications network in which any number of master
stations may independently assert control at any time, and
more particularly to a supervisory system for a network of
stations that communicate data, video and/or telephone
signals using media in which any one of the communications
stations may be used to monitor and/or control the
activities at any other station.A supervisory system for a network of
communications stations typically uses a master station to
control and monitor the status of the other stations
(collectively referred to herein as slave stations) in the
network. Any station in the network, including slave
stations may send and receive messages that may be
addressed to one or more of the other stations. The
master station sends commands to the slave stations and
keeps track of their status. For example, a master
station in New York can control and monitor the status of
a remote, unmanned cite in West Virginia by sending
commands, such as directions to perform a function, and
periodic requests for information (e.g., operating
capability of each piece of equipment, communications
backlog, unauthorized entry into the facility, etc.) The
master station may use any appropriate communication
medium to communicate with the slave stations, including 
radio, land lines, local or wide area network connections,
etc. Each station may include appropriate computer
equipment (e.g.- processor, modem, etc.) to be able to
function in the network, and appropriate transmission and
reception equipment for the data, video, telephone
signals, and the commands. Typically, upon receiving a
command, a station will send a responsive message to the
sender.Such systems have several disadvantages. For
example, when the master station requests status
information, and such information has been provided by the
slave station, the slave station clears the reported
information (known as "latched" or "time stamped"
information). Thereafter, any other station sending a
status inquiry would not receive the previous information
and receives the current status (known as "on the fly"
information) (after all, from the slave station's point of
view, the information has been provided to the only
station that needs to know the information). Further,
even if a slave station were to monitor the network, it
probably would not hear the questions and answers together
and would thus be unable to determine the status of other
stations.

<CLAIMS>
A supervisory system for a communications network having
a plurality of stations communicating through a communications

medium, 
characterised in that
 the system includes
plurality of said stations being master stations that

operate at the same time to attempt to control a plurality
of other stations as slave stations by sending commands

thereto, response means at each of said slave stations for
sending a signal that contains an indication of the command

itself and status information through the communications
medium in response to a command sent thereto and received

from any of said master stations, said signal identifying
the command received, and identification means at each of

said master stations for receiving said signal and identifying
the command in the signal so that each of said master

stations'is aware of commands sent by every other one of
said master stations, said identification means comprising

a look-up table containing the commands that may be sent by
said master stations to said slave stations.
A system as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that

said identification means comprises a decoder for identifying
the commands sent by said master stations and said

signal contains a coded command.
A system as claimed in claim 2 including a communication network 
characterized
in that
 a plurality of master stations are provided that
control a plurality of slave stations at the time, monitor

means for making each said master stations aware of the
status of each of said slave stations by identifying commands

received by said slave stations from any said master
stations, including more than two of said master stations.
A system as claimed in claim 3, 
characterized in that

response means at each of said slave stations serve for
sending a signal identifying a command sent thereto from 

one of said master stations, and said monitoring means
comprises means for identifying commands in signals sent by

said slave stations in response to receipt of the commands
from said master stations.
A method of simultaneously controlling operation of
plural slave stations with plural master stations connected

in a communications network through a communication medium,
the method being 
characterized by
 the steps of providing
means at each of said slave stations for sending signals on

said communication medium in response to receipt of commands
from any said master stations, said signals sent by

the slave stations comprising the command to query the
slave stations so that each master station is aware of the

commands sent by every other one of the master stations and status information,
said signals being monitored by identification means at

each of said master stations so that each of said master
stations is aware of the status of each of said slave

stations, said identification means using a look-up table
containing the commands that may be sent from said master

stations to slave stations.
A method as claimed in claim 5, 
characterized by
 the
step of providing means at said master stations to encode

and to decode the commands.
A method as claimed in claim 5, 
characterized by
 controlling
operation of plural slave stations with plural

master stations in a communications network, the steps of
sending commands from any said master stations to said

slave stations, sending signals from slave stations in
response to receipt of the commands, said signal identifying

the commands received, monitoring said signals at said
master stations so that each of said master stations is

aware of the status of each of said slave stations, including
the step of encoding the commands in said signals.
