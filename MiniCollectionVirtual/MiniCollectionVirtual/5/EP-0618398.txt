<ABSTRACT>
In the case of an apparatus for machining the inner surface of a pipeline which is not accessible by foot, a vehicle (6) which can travel in the pipeline contains a rotatably mounted shaft (32) which bears a machining apparatus. According to the invention, in order to transfer the operating media necessary for the supply of said machining apparatus, provision is made for ducts (161a, 166a to 169a) which are arranged in a housing shell (64) of the vehicle (6) and are connected, via rotary lead-throughs (68) to lines (161b, 166b to 169b) which are joined in a rotationally fixed manner to the machining apparatus. As a result of this measure, tangling of the supply lines which lead to the machining apparatus is virtually ruled out.

<CLAIMS>
Arrangement for the treatment of the inner 
surface of an inaccessible pipeline (40) in which a 

vehicle (6), which can be moved in the pipeline (40), 
contains a rotatably mounted shaft (32) on which at 

least indirectly there is arranged a treatment device 
(12), with channels (161a, 166a to 169a), which are 

arranged in a housing shell (64) of the vehicle (6), 
being provided for the transfer of the operating media 

required to supply the treatment device (12), 
characterised in that the channels (161a, 166a to 169a) 

are connected by way of rotary leadthrough portions 
(68) to lines (161b, 166b to 169b) which are connected 

to the treatment device (12) in a fixed manner with 
respect to rotation. 
Arrangement according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that the lines (161b, 166b to 169b), 

which are connected to the treatment device (12) in a 
fixed manner with respect to rotation, each extend 

along a partial section within the shank of the shaft 
(32). 
Arrangement according to claim 2,
 
characterised in that the rotary leadthrough portions 

(68) comprise, on the outer casing of the shaft (34) or 
on a bearing housing (66) which surrounds the shaft 

(34), grooves (68) which annularly surround the shaft 
(34) and into which the line sections (161b, 166b to 

169b), which are arranged in the shaft (34) in a fixed 
manner with respect to rotation, and the channels 

(161a, 166a to 169a), which are arranged in the housing 
shell (64) of the vehicle (6), lead. 
Arrangement according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that for the purpose of 

transmitting electrical signals slip rings (38) are 
provided that are arranged on the shaft (32) or on a 

portion (36) of the housing that connects the surface  
 

of the shaft (32) and is connected to the bearing 
housing (66) in a fixed manner with respect to 

rotation. 
Arrangement according to claim 4,
 
characterised in that a hollow shaft (32) is provided, 

in which case the slip rings (38) are arranged at least 
indirectly on the inner casing of the shaft (32) or on 

a sleeve (36) which is arranged in the interior of the 
shaft and which is connected to the housing shell (64) 

in a fixed manner with respect to rotation.
