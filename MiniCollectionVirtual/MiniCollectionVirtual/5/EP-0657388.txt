<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for purifying water by the active carbon regeneration system. Contact of tap water 
with active carbon fibers having a narrow pore distribution and excellent adsorption velocity enables adsorption and 

removal of residual chlorine harmful trihalomethanes, and odoriferous substances such as 2-methylisoborneol and 
diosmin contained in tap water. The use of active carbon fibers having a median pore diameter of about 1.8-3.0 nm, 

preferably, about 2.0-2.7 nm enables odoriferous substances having large molecular weights to be exhaustively and 
selectively adsorbed by the carbon fibers. At any time when out of use, the carbon fi
bers are heated to 100-120 °C, 
whereby the adsorbed trihalomethanes are desorbed and the fibers recover the capacity of adsorbing trihalomethanes. 

Thus the carbon fibers can, even in a limited quantity, adsorb trihalomethanes and odoriferous substances for long 
without the necessity for exchanging active carbon fiber cartridges.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process and device for 
purifying tap or city water. As tap or city water has been subjected to chlorination with 
chlorine gas or sodium hypochlorite, it contains residual 
chlorine dissolved in the form of hypochlorous ion (ClO⁻) or 
hypochlorous acid (HClO). Such residual chlorine gives rise to a 
smell which is commonly referred to as bleaching powder odor and 
is often unwelcome. Tap water also contains a small amount of 
organic chlorine compounds, including trihalomethane compounds 
such as chloroform CHCl₃ and bromodichloromethane CHCl₂Br, which 
are produced by reaction of chlorine with organic substances. 
The presence of trihalomethane compounds in tap water is drawing 
increasing public attention as they are carcinogenic, harmful 
substances. Furthermore, in recent years, phytoplanktons tend to 
increase and propagate in water sources due to water pollution 
and eutrophication, so that smelly or malodorous organic 
substances which presumably are metabolite or secreta of 
phytoplanktons are present in a small content in tap water. 
Known in the art as such plankton-originated smelly substances 
are 2-methylisoborneol C₁₁H₂₀O (hereinafter, 2-MIB) and geosmin 
C₁₂H₂₂O. These substances are generally referred-to as "musty-smelling" 
substances because of their musty odor and are likewise 
unwelcome. Conventionally, water purifying devices have been used for 
domestic or business purposes in order to remove these harmful 
and smelly substances from tap water to obtain healthful and 
palatable water. In early water purifiers, it has been customary 
to use granular activated charcoal which is capable of removing 
residual chlorine as well as, although only for a limited period  
 
of time, trihalomethanes and smelly organic substances. It is 
believed that residual chlorine is removed by chemical adsorption 
at the active sites (C-O⁻ bond) located at the surface of 
activated charcoal. Accordingly, the adsorption capability of 
granular activated charcoal with respect to residual chlorine is 
deemed to be dependent on the specific surface area of activated 
charcoal. In contrast, trihalomethanes and smelly organic 
substances are believed to be physically adsorbed by activated 
charcoal, with the hydrated molecules thereof being trapped in 
the micropores of activated charcoal. Once residual chlorine (hypochlorous ion or hypochlorous 
acid) is removed by bringing tap water in contact with activated 
charcoal, bacteria may be allowed to breed at the activated 
char
