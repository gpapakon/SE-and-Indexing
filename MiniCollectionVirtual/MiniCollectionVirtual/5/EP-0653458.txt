<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a flame-retardant and
a flame retardant thermoplastic resin composition. In
particular, it relates to a flame-retardant and a flame
retardant thermoplastic resin composition which are free
from such a toxicity problem due to a halogen gas
generated during combustion or molding as in the use of a
halogen-containing flame-retardant, are small in such
influence on the molding processing characteristics and
mechanical properties of a resin as in the use of an
inorganic flame-retardant and have long term antistatic
properties.Thermoplastic resins have been used in large
amounts in a wide field such as automobile parts, parts
for domestic appliances, parts for business, industrial
parts and miscellaneous goods; however, in some
uses, it has been required to make the resin materials to
be used incombustible or flame retardant from the viewpoint
of the controlling or minimizing of disasters and
the protecting of human life when unexpected
ignition or combustion is caused.The most general method for making a thermoplastic
resin flame retardant is to incorporate a flame-retardant 
into the resin, and as the flame-retardant,
there have been used an inorganic flame-retardant, a
representative of which is magnesium hydroxide and
aluminum hydroxide, and a halogen-containing flame-retardant,
a representative of which is decabromodiphenyl
oxide.Many other flame-retardants have also been
known, and examples thereof are mentioned in, for
example, Fine Chemical, Vol. 20, No. 11 (1991), pp.
19-36.However, when an inorganic flame-retardant is
used, this must be incorporated into a thermoplastic
resin, which is the objective base polymer, in an at
least equal amount in order to obtain the desired level
of flame retarding effect, and this fact adversely
affects the light weight, mechanical strength and cheapness,
which are the characteristics of the resin, and
causes such a problem as reduction of flow properties in
molding.The halogen-containing flame-retardant is
characterized in that even when it is used in an amount
smaller than that of the inorganic flame-retardant the
desired level of flame retarding effect is obtained and
hence its effect on the mechanical strength of the resin
is relatively small; however, there have been pointed out
such a problem that when the compounded resin is exposed
to strong heat in combustion or molding, harmful and
toxic fumes are liberated and such a fear that the 
molding machine may be corroded.On the other hand, a rapid development of a
non-halogen type
