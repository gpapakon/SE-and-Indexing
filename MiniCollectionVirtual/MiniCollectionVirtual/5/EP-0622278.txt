<CLAIMS>
A restraining system for persons in vehicles, comprising an air bag, a gas 
generator equipped with a solid propellant which fills the air bag, and an 

electrically activatable firing means in laser form for firing the solid 
propellant,
 
characterised in that
 
the laser (1) is a semi-conductor laser arranged inside a firing chamber (6, 6') 

of the gas generator (4, 4'), the beam of which is directed or concentrated 
directly on the gas-producing solid propellant (8) in the firing process. 
A restraining system according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that
 
transmission and/or reflection members (9, 10, 11) are provided to guide the 

beam (2) of the laser (1) into a propellant chamber (5, 5') filled with the solid 
propellant (8). 
A restraining system according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that
 
a focussing means (11) is arranged in the housing (3, 3') of the gas generator 

(4 4'), whereby the beam (2) of the laser (1) can be focused directly on the 
propellant (8). 
A restraining system according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that
 
the laser (1) is formed by a plurality of semi-conductor lasers which are 

juxtaposed in a matrix. 
A restraining system according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that
 
the laser light can be radiated onto the propellant (8), symmetrically 

distributed relative to an axis of symmetry of the propellant.  
 
A restraining system according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that
 
the laser (1) may be operated with a pulsing action. 
A restraining system according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that
 
the propellant (8) is coated with a substance which at least partially absorbs 

the beam (2) of the laser (1).
