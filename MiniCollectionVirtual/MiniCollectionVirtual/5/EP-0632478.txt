<ABSTRACT>
The movable contact arm 17 of a circuit breaker 1 is mounted on a 
pivot pin 2 by a slot 29 which extends generally transverse to the longitudinal arm 

19 of the contact arm, so that when the contacts 9 are welded, initial motion of the 
circuit breaker operating mechanism 43 to open the contacts 9 is translated into 

pivoting of the contact arm 17 about, and thereby breaking the weld. In a circuit 
breaker 1 in which the contact arm 17 is coupled to the operating mechanism 43 

through a cam mechanism 75-85 which allows the contact arm 17 to blow open in 
response to very high overcurrents, the slot 29 extends generally longitudinally so 

that the cam mechanism 75-85 translates initial movement of the operating 
mechanism 43 into longitudinal movement of the contact arm 17 to apply a shear 

force tending to break the weld.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electrical circuit interrupting device such as a 
molded case circuit breaker having a mechanism for applying a force to break open 
contacts which have become welded closed. Certain types of electrical circuit interrupting devices such as molded case 
circuit breakers, have for each phase a set of separable contacts including in a fixed 
contact secured to the molded casing and a moveable contact mounted near one end 
of an elongated contact arm which is pivotally mounted at the opposite end. An 
operating mechanism actuated manually by a handle, or automatically by a trip 
mechanism responsive to various over-current conditions, pivots the contact arm to 
open and close the contacts. Some of these molded case circuit breakers, for 
instance those disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,894,747 and 5,142,112, have a 
coupling between the operating mechanism and the contact arm which permits the 
contact arm to blow open through the operation of repulsion forces in response to 
very large over-currents before the operating mechanism can respond through the 
trip device. It has been found, however, that high in-rush currents such as those 
caused by the starting of a motor in a circuit protected by the molded case circuit 
breaker, can cause the contacts to chatter resulting in welding of the contacts in a 
closed position which is obviously an undesirable and unsafe condition. Light welds 
can be broken by the operating mechanism either automatically through operation 
of the trip device or by application of a manual force in the open direction on the 
handle. However, the operating mechanism is typically connected to the contact 
arm close to the pivot point of the arm and, therefore, does not have sufficient 
mechanical advantage to break stronger welds with the force that can be generated 
with the operating mechanism. There is a need, therefore, for an improved circuit interrupting device in 
which sufficient force can be generated through the operating mechanism to break 
any welds that may develop between the contacts.  There is a further need for providing such a feature on present circuit 
breaker designs which does not require extensive modification of the circuit breaker 
and is not costly. These and other needs are satisfied by the invention which is directed 
to an electrical circuit interrupting device in which the moveable contact arm, 
having the movable contact mounted adjacent one end, is mounted at the second end 
by mounting means which allows translation as well
