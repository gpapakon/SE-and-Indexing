<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a coupling
site for use in medical applications and more
particularly, to a coupling site which includes a valve
element and support structure for cooperation with a
standard male luer lock having a male luer taper and a
threaded locking collar.In recent years there has been increased
concern with the spread of infectious diseases which may
result from puncture wounds made by medical needles.
There is also concern with the inconvenience of handling
devices having needles which may inflict painful puncture
wounds and which may be easily broken. However, needles
have continued to be used in a association with injection
sites or other coupling sites in medical applications to
transfer fluids to and from syringes or fluid conveying
cannula. The continued use of needles for such coupling
sites may be attributed to the convenience with which a
needle may be inserted through a soft diaphragm wherein a
fluid-tight seal is formed around the needle and,
subsequently the needle may be withdrawn from the
diaphragm resulting in the diaphragm resiliently filling
in and closing the aperture formed by the needle. Thus,
needle type injection sites have the advantages of
providing quick access for a fluid cannula as well as
providing an access site which ensures a fluid-tight seal
due to the small size of the aperture formed in the
diaphragm by the needle.In spite of the advantages associated with
needle type injection sites, there is a recognized need
for replacing such an injection site with one which
eliminates the needle in order to avoid the disadvantages
associated therewith including the possibility of medical
personnel receiving a puncture wound during the use
thereof and the progressive deterioration of the 
diaphragm resulting from-repetitive puncturing of the
diaphragm.One proposed solution for eliminating needles
at coupling sites includes providing a valve member
having a slit for receiving a blunt cannula therethrough
wherein the slit is biased to a closed position such that
a fluid-tight seal is formed at the valve member when the
cannula is removed.U.S. Patent No. 4,765,588 to Atkinson discloses
a valve for receiving the blunt end of a syringe and
includes a slit diaphragm member mounted within a tubular
body wherein the diaphragm is stretched in the area of
the slit and moves in close to the tubular body as a luer
taper portion of the syringe is inserted. In addition,
the exterior wall of the body portion is dimensioned to
be received within a threaded locking collar of

<CLAIMS>
A medical coupling site (10), for use with a cannula provided with an
internally threaded locking collar, including:


a housing comprising a support base (12) and a rigid tubular retainer (14)
supported on and extending from the support base;
a resiliency deformable valve element (16), including a closure element
(34), retained within the retainer (14) and extending across a first end (54) of

the retainer which is remote from the support base (12), the closure element
including a diametrically extending slit (36) for receiving the cannula;

lug means (58,60) extending outwardly from the retainer (14) for engaging
a thread within the threaded locking collar of a cannula when the first end of

the retainer is inserted into the threaded locking collar;

   characterised in that:
the resiliently deformable valve element (16) includes a tubular body
portion (28) having a first end (30) remote from the support base (12) and a

second end (32) adjacent the support base, an outer wall surface in contact
with the retainer (14), and an inner wall surface defining a passage for

receiving the cannula comprising a male luer taper (50);
the closure element (34) of the valve element (16) comprises a
diaphragm formed integrally with the body portion (28), extending across the

first end (30) of the body portion (28), and deflectable into the passage upon
insertion of a male luer taper into the passage through the slit (36) in the

diaphragm;
the combined thickness of the walls of the retainer (14) and body
portion (28) is dimensioned to be received in an annular space defined between

the male luer taper (50) and the internally threaded collar (62) of a male
standard

luer
lock fitting (64); and
the resilient valve element (16) also includes basing means (44,46;44'' to
to 47'') extending inwardly from the inner wall surface of the body portion (28) 

toward the slit (36) for biasing the diaphragm (34) towards a position in which
the slit is closed, the biasing means defining spaces (41, 68'', 70'') for

accommodating material of the valve element when deformed by insertion of
the male luer taper through the slit and into the passage.
The medical coupling site of claim 1, wherein said support base (12)
defines a longitudinal axis, and the wall thickness of the body portion (28),

measured in a direction perpendicular to said longitudinal axis, is greater than
the wall thickness of the retainer (14) at a location adjacent to the thread-engaging

means (58, 60).
The medical coupling site of claim 1 or 2, wherein the biasing means
(44, 46; 44'' to 47'') is integral with the diaphragm (34) and inner wall surface

of the valve element (16).
The medical coupling site of claim 3, wherein the basing means (44, 46;
44'' to 47'') includes discrete members defining spaces (41, 68'', 70'')

therebetween for accommodating material of the valve element (16) when
deformed by insertion of the male luer taper through the slit (36) and into the

passage.
The medical coupling site of claim 4, wherein said discrete members
(44,46; 44'' to 47'') extend radially inwardly from the inner wall surface of the

body portion, and extend in a direction from said second end (32) toward said
first end (30) of said body portion (28).
The medical coupling site of claim 5, wherein said discrete members
comprise a pair of rib members (44, 46) integral with the body portion (28)

and diaphragm (34) and reinforcing the diaphragm, and extending perpendicular

members defining a width dimension in a direction parallel to the length of the
slit which is less than an interior diameter defined by the inner wall surface (48)

of the body portion (28).
The medical coupling site of claim 5, wherein said discrete members

diaphragm (34) and reinforcing the diaphragm, and spaced apart in pairs in a
direction parallel to the length of the slit (36).
The medical coupling site of any preceding claim, wherein said first end
(30) of said body portion (28) includes an annular end surface (42) defining a

plane, and said diaphragm (34) defines a curved, for example dome-shaped,
