<DESCRIPTION>
 2-AMINO-BENZOXAZI ONES FOR THE TREATMENT OF HERPES SIMPLEX VIRUSField of the InventionThis invention is in the field of antiviral agents and specifically relates to compounds, compositions and methods for treating Herpes Simplex Virus.Background of the InventionThere is a great need for new therapies for the treatment of viral diseases. Whereas there has been great progress in developing a variety of therapies for the treatment of bacterial infections, there are few viable therapies for the treatment of viruses. Zidovudine is the primary approved treatment for human immunodeficiency virus. Ganciclovir, acyclovir, and foscarnet are currently utilized for the treatment of herpesvirus infections. However, these therapies can have substantial side effects based on their deleterious effects on host cell DNA replication or their effect on a limited number of viral infections. In addition, viruses are known to develop resistance to therapies, which causes a progressive decline in efficacy.Viruses are classified into broad categories based on whether they incorporate RNA or DNA. Important virus families classified of the DNA type include adenoviridae, poxviridae, papovaviridae and herpesviridae. Herpesviridae is a family of DNA viruses which include herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1), herpes simplex virus type-2 (HSV-2), cytomegalo virus (CMV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), Epstein-Barr virus, human herpesvirus-6 (HHV6), human herpesvirus-7 (HHV7), human herpesvirus-8 (HHV8), pseudorabies and rhinotracheitis, among others. It is known that herpesviruses express their genetic content by directing the synthesis of a number of proteins encoded by the herpesvirus DNA in the host cell. One of the important virus-encoded proteins is made as a precursor consisting of an amino terminal-located protease and carboxyl terminal-located assembly protein. This precursor is proteolytically processed in an autocatalytic manner at a specific 

amino acid sequence known as the "release" site yielding separate protease and assembly protein. The assembly protein is cleaved further by the protease at another specific amino acid sequence known as the "maturation" cleavage site. Recently, EP 514,830, published November 25, 1992, describes a virus-specific serine protease which has a role in herpesvirus replication. Additionally, Lui andRoizman (J. Virol, 65, 5149 (1991)) describe the sequence and activity of a protease and the associated assembly protein encoded by UL26 of HSV-1. A. R. Welch et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 88,
