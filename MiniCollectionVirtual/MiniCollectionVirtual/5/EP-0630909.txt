<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is in the technical field of dispersion polymerization, and
in particular dispersion polymerization of ethylenically-unsaturated monomers to
produce water-soluble polymers. Especially, the present invention refers to a
process for preparing a water-continuous dispersion of a water-soluble polymer
that has not only a low end-product viscosity and permits rapid dissolution of the
polymer in water but also provides control over the peak-in production viscosity
parameter.Water-soluble synthetic polymers are widely used as flocculating agents, dehydrating
agents, papermaking chemicals, dispersants, soil improvers, and the like. The polymers are
hydrophilic due to the present of ionic and/or highly-polar mer units within their polymeric
structure. Water-soluble polymers may be anionic, cationic, amphoteric or polar-nonionic (such
as polyacrylamide). Water-soluble polymers generally have weight average molecular weights
of at least about 1,000, and commonly much higher, and of course do not have water solubility 
characteristics comparable to inorganic salts such as sodium chloride. Instead aqueous solutions
of water-soluble polymers often are significantly viscous at polymer concentrations of even 5 or
10 weight percent. When these polymers are used in aqueous systems as flocculants, dispersants
and the like, their use concentrations are typically very low, and often as low as several parts per
million (ppm) or even parts per billion (ppb). When used at low concentrations the viscosity
problems seen at higher polymer concentrations are, of course, not encountered.An optimal polymerization technique is one that both is itself commercially practicable
and produces a polymer in a form best suited for the commercial use of the polymer, including
commercial factors such as storage and shipping of the polymer product. When the intended
commercial application of the polymer is dependent at least in part on the polymer's
water-solubility, the ease of solubilization/dispersion of the polymer in the use environment
and/or polymer feed fluid is often a primary factor, but nonetheless generally not a factor that
wholly outweighs other commercial practicalities. Commercial polymerization techniques
generally include polymerization of monomers in solution, in suspension, held within an
emulsion or in bulk (neat), each of which have advantages and disadvantages as to the
polymerization process, the form in which the product is supplied, the extraneous materials
contained in the polymer product and the
