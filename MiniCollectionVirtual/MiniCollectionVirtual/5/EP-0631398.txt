<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the waveform shaping
equipment and waveform-shaping method for generating
bandlimited signals, and for preventing band spread at the
head and trail at the edge of burst when burst-like data
string is transmitted in the data transmission in which data
is transmitted in the form of packet.In the radio communication, etc., when a packet
comprising transmission data is transmitted, it is necessary
to limit the bandwidth (bandlimitation) to prevent adjacent
channel interference for effective utilization of frequency.
For bandlimitation of signals, it is common to limit the
bandwidth with respect to the signal waveform of the
baseband. Two systems are available for band-limiting the
baseband signal waveform: an analog system using analog
filter and a digital system by digital signal processing.
One of the digital systems is the method to shape waveform
by reading out and concatenating the baseband signal
waveform previously band-limited by calculation from the
memory table such as ROM and the like (for example, IEEE
Transactions on Communications, COM-Volume 25, No. 10, Pages
1243-1244). When the waveform shaping method using this
memory table system is used, the ideal filter frequency 
response can be more accurately realized than the analog
system waveform shaping method, and the shaped waveform can
be changed only by rewriting the memory contents, achieving
high versatility. It is also suited for the VLSI technique
and can be comparatively downsized.Such a digital low pass filter for performing band-limitation in a QPSK modulation
circuit is described in EP-A-0 494 696. The filter comprises a read only memory
(ROM) which stores segments of convoluted base-band waveforms in order to
provide for an inter-symbol interference of a plurality of consecutive symbols. The
band-limited waveform for a currently processed symbol is obtained by reading a
segment from the memory in accordance with a predetermined number of preceding
and succeeding symbols.Referring now to the drawings, the conventional
waveform shaping equipment using the above-mentioned method
is described with special emphasis placed on the readout
principle of shaped waveform and hardware configuration of
the waveform shaping equipment.FIG. 1 shows input data to the waveform shaping
equipment. D(1), D(2), ....., D(k), ..... D(n) show
transmission data and X shows the data other than the
transmission data,which does not have any information. Each
data is successively read into the waveform shaping
