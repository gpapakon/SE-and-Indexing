<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink-jet
printing apparatus and a printing method for
performing printing by ejecting an ink to a printing
medium, such as clothes and so forth.Throughout this specification, the wording
"print" should be appreciated to include "textile
printing". Furthermore, in the specification,
"coloring matter is fixed on a printing medium"
includes coloring of the printing medium employing
the coloring matter in the extent that substantially
no washing-out of the color is caused. Also, "tone"
means "color" and "density". Accordingly, "same
tone" means substantially the same color and the
same density.As typical conventional textile printing
apparatus for performing printing on clothes, there
have been known apparatus employing a roller
printing method of forming a sequential pattern on a
cloth by depressing a roller on which a pattern is
carved onto the cloth, or employing screen printing
method preparing plates in a screen form and using
the screen plates corresponding to number of colors 
and patterns to be overlaid so as to perform
printing directly on the clothes or so forth.However, in the textile printing apparatus
employing the roller printing method or screen
printing method, large number of process steps and
days in preparation of the roller or the screen. In
addition, these textile printing apparatus requires
operations for blending of various colors of inks
for color matching and positioning of the roller or
the screen plates. Furthermore, the apparatus per
se is relative large and becomes larger according to
increasing of number of colors to be used, and
therefore require relatively wide space for
installation. Furthermore, an additional space is
further required for storing the rollers and screen
plates.On the other hand, as a recording apparatus to
be employed in a printer, copy machine, facsimile
and so forth, or as a recording apparatus to be
employed as an information output apparatus in
composite electronic apparatus including computers,
word processors and so forth or work stations, an
ink-jet type printing apparatus has been put into
practical use. In Japanese Patent Application
Publication No. 62-57750 and Japanese Patent
Application Publication No. 63-31594, there has been
proposed to employ such ink-jet type recording
apparatus for the textile printing and to perform
printing by ejecting ink directly on the clothes.The ink-jet type recording apparatus performs
recording by ejecting ink toward a printing medium
from a recording head, and holds many

claim 4, further comprising fixing means (25) for fixing

ink on said printing medium (3), wherein said fixing
means (25) is arranged to fix on said recording medium

(3) ink ejected from some of said plurality of ink jet
heads (13) in a first printing step prior to ink of the

same tone but different composition being ejected by
other ink jet heads (13') of said plurality of ink jet

heads as a further printing step.
An ink jet printing apparatus in accordance with any
preceding claim, further comprising means (102) for

varying the ratio of inks ejected from said plurality of
ink jet heads (13, 13') in said printing steps depending

upon the ratio of the plurality of mutually distinct
fibers in said printing medium (3).
