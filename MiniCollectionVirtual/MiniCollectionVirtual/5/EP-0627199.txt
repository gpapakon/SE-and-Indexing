<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for attaching together i) a surgical 
needle (100) having a generally cylindrical end portion (120) defining 

an elongate aperture (102) having a generally circular cross-section 
and ii) a suture (200) having a generally elongate end 

portion of generally circular cross-section corresponding 
in dimension to the elongate aperture (102) of the needle (100). The 

apparatus includes a pair of dies (20), each having a die 
face (24) with an inner die surface portion (28). The inner 

die surface portion (28) includes at least one generally planar 
crimping surface (30) having an arcuate recess (32) formed therein 

which extends along at least a portion of the planar 
crimping surface (30). The arcuate recess (32) defines a material 

relief zone such that when the end portion of the suture (200) is 
positioned within the aperture (102) of the needle (100) and the dies 

(20) are positioned about the generally cylindrical end portion (120) 
of the needle (100) with the crimping surfaces (30) generally facing 

the outer surface thereof, the application of an inward 
crimping force to the dies (20) causes the dies (20) to impact the 

needle (100) and produce inward crimping forces on opposed sides 
of the needle end portion (120) to attach the needle (100) to the 

suture (200). The relief zones defined by the arcuate recesses 
(32) receive and collect deformed material from the needle (100). 

According to the invention, the symmetry of the needle (100) is 
maintained and the attachment is predictable and superior 

to those of the prior art. A surgical needle-suture 
combination having a controlled suture release is also 

disclosed as well as a method for forming such attachment 

is also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the attachment
of surgical sutures to surgical needles. In particular,
the invention relates to apparatus for the attachment of
surgical needles to surgical sutures to provide a combined
surgical needle-suture device possessing controlled suture
release characteristics. Such apparatus is disclosed in
Applicant's EP-A-426377, on which the pre-characterising
part of claims 1 and 7 below is based.For many years, surgeons have employed needle-suture
combinations in which a suture or ligature is
attached to the shank end of a needle. Such needle-suture
combinations are provided for a wide variety of
monofilament and braided suture materials, both absorbable
and no-absorbable, e.g., catgut, silk, nylon, polyester,
polypropylene, linen, cotton, and absorbable synthetic
materials such as polymers and copolymers of glycolic and
lactic acids.Needle-suture combinations fall into two general
classes: standard needle attachment and removable or
detachable needle attachment. In the case of standard
needle attachment, the suture is securely attached to the
needle and is not intended to be separable therefrom,
except by cutting or severing the suture. Removable needle
attachment, by contrast, is such that the needle is
separable from the suture in response to a force exerted by
the surgeon. Minimum acceptable forces required to
separate a needle from a suture for various suture sizes
are set forth in the United States Pharmacopeia (USP XXII 
1990). The United States Pharmacopeia prescribes minimum
individual pull-out forces and minimum average pull-out
forces as measured for five needle-suture combinations.
The minimum pull-out forces for both standard and removable
needle-suture attachment set forth in the United States
Pharmacopeia are hereby incorporated by reference.One typical method for securing a suture to a
needle involves providing a cylindrical recess in the shank
end of a needle and securing a suture therein. For
example, U.S. Patent No. 1,558,037 teaches the addition of
a cement material to such a substantially cylindrical
recess to secure the suture therein. Additional methods
for bonding a suture within a needle bore are described in
U.S. Patent Nos. 2,928,395 (adhesives) and 3,394,704
(bonding agents). Alternatively, a suture may be secured
within an axial bore in a needle by swaging the needle in
the region of the recess, see, e.g., U.S. Patent No.
1,250,114. Additional prior art methods for securing a
suture within a needle bore include expansion of a catgut
suture

<CLAIMS>
A needle (100)-suture (200) combination,
which comprises:


a) a surgical needle (100) including a sharp end
(130) and a blunt end (120), at opposite ends of the axis

of the needle, said blunt end defining an elongate aperture
(102) therein;
b) a suture (200) having a generally elongate
end portion which is positioned within said elongate

aperture (102) of said needle; and
c) a portion (36) of said blunt end swaged to
cause attachment of said needle to said suture;

the needle-suture combination being characterised
by:
d) said swaged portion including at least two

generally planar surfaces (36), each of which is angularly
offset relative to a longitudinal axis defined by said

elongate aperture of said needle and has one
substantially arcuate raised portion (38), said swaged

portion having symmetry around the needle axis, and having
substantially the same general cross-sectional character as

the remaining portion of said blunt end, said angular
offset tapering radially inwardly, relative to the axis of

the needle, going from the blunt end of the needle towards
the sharp end.
The needle-suture combination according to
claim 1 wherein said elongate aperture (102) of said needle

has a generally circular cross-section.

elongate aperture, and said dies are positioned about the
generally cylindrical end portion of the needle with said

crimping surfaces generally facing the outer surface
thereof, having symmetry about the line corresponding to

the needle axis, and applying inward crimping force to said 
dies causes said dies to impact the needle and produce

inward crimping forces on opposed sides of the needle end
portion to attach the needle to the suture whereby said

axial cross-sectional symmetry of the needle in the portion
crimped by said dies, and further being characterised in

which defines a plane which is angularly

offset relative to a plane defined by said die face, said
angular offset tapering inwardly relative to the axis of

the die cavity in which the needle is received, in a
direction corresponding to movement along the cylindrical

end portion towards the said sharp end.

plane of said crimping surface defines an angle ranging

from about 6° to about 15° relative to said plane of said
die face.
Apparatus according to claim 7 or 8 wherein
said arcuate recess defines a radius of curvature which

remains constant throughout its length.
Apparatus according to any one of claims 7
to 9 wherein an axis defined by said arcuate recess is
