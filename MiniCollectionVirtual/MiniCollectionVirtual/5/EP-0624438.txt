<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a method for cutting the covering sheet (1) of a laminated sheet material, the sound field sensed by the cutting action of the cutting edge (5) is evaluated for a control of the penetration depth of the cutting edge (5) as far as the parting plane (X-X) of the covering sheet (1) against the backing sheet (2) of the sheet material.

A process for cutting the cover foil (1) of a laminated
foil material, wherein a cutting tool (6) prepares an incision

in the cover foil (1) , whereby an adjustment of
the cutting e
dge (5) for reaching a depth of penetration
takes place as far as substantially to a plane (X-X) separating

the cover foil (1) from a carrier foil (2) of the
foil material,

characterised in that

a first sound field (A) is detected which is obtained by
a cutting contact of the cutting edge (5) of the cutting

tool (8) at least as far as to the plane separating the
cover foil (1) from the carrier foil (2);
a second sound field (B) is detected which is scanned
during the preparation of the incision by the cutting contact

of the cutting edge (5) of the cutting tool (6)
with the foil material and differentiated from the first

sound field (A); and
any deviation (C) from the first sound field (A) as detected
with such differentiation is evaluated for a new

adjustment of the cutting edge (5) of the cutting tool (6)
to a depth of penetration as predetermined by the first

sound field (A).
Process according to claim 1, wherein the cover foil (1) is
connected to the carrier foil (2) via an adhesive layer (3),

and the depth of penetration of the cutting edge (5) of the 
cutting tool (6) is adjusted at maximum to the plane (X-X)

separating this adhesive layer (3) from the carrier foil (2),
whereby the first sound field (A) is scanned with the sound

vibrations influenced by the cover foil (1) and by the
adhesive layer (3).
Process according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the carrier foil
(2) is formed with a carrier paper coated with a wax layer

(4), and the second sound field is scanned with the sound
vibrations influenced by the wax layer (4).
Process according to any of the claims 1 to 3, wherein
the sound field present during the preparation of the incision

is continuously scanned.
Process according to any of the claims 1 to 3, wherein
the sound field present during the preparation of the incision

is scanned preiodically at predetermined time
intervals.
Process according to any of the claims 1 to 3 and 5,
wherein the sound field present during the preparation of

the incision is scanned at predetermined measurement points
along the path of movement of the cutting tool (6).
Process according to any of the claims 1 to 6, wherein
the sound field present during the preparation of the incision

is scanned by a sound pickup (7), and the sound
vibrations present are converted into electrical vibrations

and are analysed by an electrical filter (9) in order to
generate a control signal when a deviation from the sound

vibrations of the first sound field is detected, and with
which control signal the depth of penetration of the cutting 

edge (5) is reset to the plane (X-X) separating the
cover foil (1) from the carrier foil (2) of the foil material.
A device for cutting the cover foil (1) of a laminated
foil material, wherein a cutting tool (6) of the device

prepares an incision in the cover foil (1), whereby an
adjustment of the cutting edge (5) takes place as far as

substantially to a plane (X-X) separating the cover foil
(1) from the carrier foil (2) of the foil material for

reaching a depth of penetration,

characterised in that a sound pickup (7) is arranged on
the cutting tool (6) which during the preparation of the

incision scans the sound field present at the cutting contact
of the cutting edge (5), and is connected to an electrical

filter (9) which analyzes the electrical vibrations
which are supplied by the sound pickup (7) and correspond

to the sound vibrations of the sound field scanned, and
which supplies a control signal when a deviation over the

sound vibrations of the sound field is detected which predetermines
teh depth of penetration of the cutting edge

reaching at least as far as to the plane (X-X) separating
the cover foil (1) from the carrier foil (2) of the foil

material, and with which control signal the cutting edge
(5) of the cutting tool (6) may be reset to the predetermined

depth of penetration.
Device according to claim 8, wherein the sound pickup (7)
is connected to the electrical filter (9) via an amplifier (8).
Device according to claim 8 or 9, wherein the control
signal supplied by the electrical filter (9) actuates a

servo motor (10) which lowers and raises the cutting tool
(6) of a cutting plotter.
