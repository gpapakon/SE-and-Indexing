<ABSTRACT>
In a recorder and/or reproducer, a disc cartridge container is 
loaded, in which a plurality of disc cartridges are accommodated without 

superposition of the cartridges by arranging a plurality of cartridge 
housing parts storing the disc cartridges in a matrix on one 

plane. This disc recorder and/or reproducer is provided with a rotary 
support base which supports a driver support base on which are 

mounted a disc rotating mechanism capable of approaching and parting 
from the disc cartridge, and an optical pick-up; a fixed support 

base which so supports the rotary support base as to rotate; a rotating 
mechanism which rotates the rotary support base; and a driver support 

base lifting mechanism which lifts and lowers the driver support 
base in order to allow the disc rotation driving mechanism and the 

optical pick-up to approach and part from the disc cartridge. By rotating 
the rotary support base, and by causing the disc rotation driving 

mechanism and the optical pick-up to approach and part from the 
disc cartridge, data on a plurality of discs are reproduced in sequence 

without moving the disc cartridges.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a disc cartridge container for
containing and holding a matrix array of a plurality of disc
cartridges each housing a disc on which information signals such
as music signals are recorded or are to be recorded, and to a
disc recording and/or reproducing apparatus for selecting one of
the plural disc cartridges contained and held within the disc
cartridge container and recording/reproducing the information
signals on or from the disc contained in the selected disc
cartridge, or sequentially recording/reproducing the information
signals on or from the discs contained in the disc cartridges.There has hitherto been employed a disc recording and/or
reproducing apparatus having a disc exchange function of
selecting one of disc cartridges previously stored in a disc
container and of reproducing information signals, such as music
signals, recorded on a disc contained in each disc cartridge, or
recording information signals on the disc.With such disc recording and/or reproducing apparatus, the
disc cartridges are contained in the cartridge container so that
the major surfaces of the disc contained in the disc cartridges
face each other, that is, plural disc cartridges in the form of 
thin plates are stacked vertically.By stacking the disc cartridges and containing them in this
state in the cartridge container, plural disc cartridges may be
efficiently contained in a smaller space.However, for recording and/or replay of the information
signals, it becomes necessary to provide a disc exchange
mechanism for pulling out the disc cartridge from the cartridge
container and transferring the disc cartridge to a disc recording
and/or reproducing section for loading thereon. Besides, with
a disc recording and/or reproducing apparatus, having such disc
exchange function, it is necessary to provide a mechanism whereby
the disc cartridge pulled out from the cartridge container may
be loaded on a disc driving unit provided with a disc
rotationally driving mechanism and/or information signal
recording and/or reproducing means. The result is the increased
size and complicated mechanism of the disc recording and/or
reproducing apparatus.On the other hand, with the disc container having cartridge
container sections for holding plural disc cartridges in a
stacked state, it is not possible to check the indication of the
recording contents of the disc contained in the disc cartridge
on a label affixed on the surface of the disc cartridge.Besides, with the cartridge container containing plural disc
cartridges
