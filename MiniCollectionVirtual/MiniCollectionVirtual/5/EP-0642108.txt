<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a navigation system capable
of registering a telephone number for a set point.The navigation system guides a route so that a user can drive
his car safely to visit a first destination. In recent years, techniques
for improving the performances and functions such as the accuracy,
operability and visibility of navigation have been vigorously
developed to provide a variety of systems. This navigation system
is equipped with a display screen to be used for setting the route
or a display screen to be opened automatically or upon request of
the driver at the time of route guidance. The navigation system is
equipped as its display screen after the start of guide with at least:
section maps for guiding a wide area covering several sections of
the set whole route including such a section as is being run; and
an intersection map for guiding the intersections.The navigation system not only has those section maps and
intersection maps but also: provides the remaining distance and the
information such as the name or turning direction of an intersection
to be turned, so that the route may be followed without fail ;
teaches characteristic objects so that the route can be confirmed
during the drive; guides the route not only by the display but also
by voices; displays the route on the map so that the guidance may
be made on the displayed route for the actual drive; and scrolls the
map automatically along the route so that the route can be
confirmed.In this navigation system, in order to set the route, it is 
necessary to input the starting point and the destination. When the
starting point and the destination are determined by this inputting,
the route retrieving is executed from the road information data
around and between the starting point and the destination, so that
the optimum one of a plurality of routes is set. As the method of
inputting the starting point and the destination, there have been
proposed: a method by which the positions to be registered such
as the starting point or the destination are classified by genre
according to the sight - seeing, parking areas or restaurants or coded
according to the areas such as prefectures or cities so that the codes
may be inputted ; a method by which not only the code number is
inputted but also the menu is displayed so that the items in the
menu may be sequentially selected and inputted; a method by which
node data are joined to define road networks so that the position
may be inputted in terms of east longitudes and north latitudes

<CLAIMS>
A navigation system comprising:

a) storage means containing map data (1) and at least one list (2, 7) for
storing telephone numbers and positional coordinates in a corresponding

manner,
b) telephone number input means (3) for inputting a telephone number,
c) point setting means (8) for setting at least one desired point on a map with
user's operation, and
d) retrieval means (6) being capable of retrieving a set of data of telephone
numbers and positional coordinates having a corresponding relationship.

   
characterized by
e) control means (50) for registering in said list (2, 7) the telephone number
inputted by said telephone number input means (3) and the positional

coordinates of said point set by said point setting means (8) in a
corresponding manner
The system according to claim 1, further comprising display means (4) for
displaying the map after reading said map data on the basis of said positional

coordinates. 
The system according to claim 2, wherein said display means (4) displays the
map after reading said map data in terms of the coordinates of a

representative point of the area code of the telephone number if it is decided
by the retrieval means (6) that said inputted telephone number is not in said

storage means.
The system according to any of claims 1 to 3 wherein said storage means
includes: a first list (2) having in advance telephone numbers and positional

coordinates corresponding to said telephone numbers, and a second list (2, 7)
having positional coordinates corresponding to the telephone numbers which

are registered by the user in said storage means.
The system according to claim 4 wherein said control means (50) registers the
telephone number inputted by said telephone number input means (3) and

said positional coordinates of the point set by said point setting means (8) in a
corresponding manner in said second list (2, 7), respectively, if it is decided by

said retrieval means (6) that said inputted telephone number is not in said list
(2, 7).
The system according to any of claims 1 to 5 wherein said storage means
comprises a programmable data construction.
The system according to any of daims 1 to 6 further comprising point coordinate setting means (9) for setting the positional coordinates set by said point setting means (8) as
point coordinates for performing guidance, said system being for guiding on

the basis of said point coordinates.
A method of using a navigation system comprising the steps of:

a) inputting a telephone number,
b) retrieving the telephone number from at least one list (2, 7) storing
telephone numbers and positional coordinates in a correspondina manner, 
c) setting at least one desired point on a map with user's operation on the
basis of map data (1) in storage means, if the inputted telephone

number is not in said storage means, and
d) registering in said list (2, 7) the telephone number and the positional
coordinates of the set point in a corresponding manner so as to be capable

of retrieving a set of data of telephone numbers and positional coordinates
having a corresponding relationship.
A method of using a navigation system comprising the steps of:

a) setting at least one desired point on a map as a memory point with user's
operation on the basis of map data (1) in storage means,
b) inputting a telephone number as information correlated with the set point,
and
c) registering in a list (2, 7) the telephone number and the positional
coordinates of the set point in a corresponding manner so as to be capable

of retrieving a set of data of telephone numbers and positional coordinates
having a corresponding relationship.
