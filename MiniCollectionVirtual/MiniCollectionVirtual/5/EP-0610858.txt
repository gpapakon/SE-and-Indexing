<ABSTRACT>

system using the same are disclosed. The apparatus 

comprises code generation means for generating a 
reference spread code corresponding to a first signal 

modulated by a spread code, and a surface acoustic wave 
element for receiving the first signal and a second 

signal output from the code generation means, and 
outputting a demodulated information signal. The 

surface acoustic wave element comprises a piezoelectric 
substrate, a first excitation electrode, formed on the 

piezoelectric substrate, for generating a first 
surface acoustic wave which propagates in a predetermined 

direction in accordance with the first signal, a second 
excitation electrode, formed on the piezoelectric 

substrate, for generating a second surface acoustic wave 
which propagates in a direction opposite to the 

predetermined direction in accordance with the second 
signal, and an acousto-electric converter, formed 

between the first and second excitation electrodes on 
the piezoelectric substrate, for outputting a 

convolution signal of the first and second signals on 
the basis of the first and second surface acoustic 

waves, wherein the acousto-electric converter 
selectively converts a surface acoustic wave having a 

wave number twice a wave number of the first and second 
surface acoustic waves into an electrical signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for
demodulating an information signal and, more
particularly, to a demodulation apparatus suitable for
demodulating a signal modulated by spread spectrum
modulation and a communication system using the same.A spread spectrum communication is a communication
for transmitting an information signal by spreading the
information signal to a sufficiently wide bandwidth,
and has the following features. That is, the spread
spectrum communication allows code divided
multiplexing, is strong against a disturbance, has a
high privacy function, and so on.In reception processing of the spread spectrum
communication, an information signal is demodulated by
executing so-called inverse spreading processing for
correlating spread codes assigned to respective
channels with a received signal. Conventionally, a
receiver of the spread spectrum communication is
divided into a synchronization unit and a demodulation
unit. The synchronization unit achieves
synchronization by a sliding correlation method for 
detecting a correlation between received spread codes
and reference spread codes having a bit rate slightly
different from that of the received spread codes.As a system capable of high-speed synchronous
acquisition, a system using a convolver is known. The
convolver is a convolution arithmetic element, and
serves as a correlator when one of two input signals is
set to be a temporally inverted signal. More
specifically, when a received signal is input as one of
input signals to the convolver, and a signal obtained
by temporally inverting the received signal is input as
the other input signal, the two signals coincide with
each other at a certain timing, and generate a sharp
peak output. In particular, if spread codes used in
this case are those with good auto-correlation
characteristics, a sharp peak output is generated only
when the two signals coincide with each other;
otherwise, almost no output appears. As one of
convolvers, an elastic surface wave convolver is known.
The elastic surface wave convolver is effective for
high-speed transmission since it is an analog
arithmetic element, and can execute signal processing
in real time.Fig. 1 shows a conventional spread spectrum
receiver using an elastic surface wave convolver.
Referring to Fig. 1, the receiver comprises first and
second frequency converters 2 and 4, an elastic surface 
wave element (convolver) 5, a filter (F) 6, a detector
(D) 10, a peak detection circuit (PD) 8, and code
generators (CG) 3 and 9. A received
