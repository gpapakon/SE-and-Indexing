<ABSTRACT>
In order to improve the adhesion of coatings, especially metal coatings, to the surfaces of plastic components, the latter are pretreated in low-pressure plasma with a process gas containing sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) which is substantially free of oxygen, the plastic surfaces being kept free of fluorine deposits or inclusions during the pretreatment.

<CLAIMS>
A process for pretreating the surface of plastics components in a low-pressure plasma, 
for the subsequent deposition of films, particularly metal films, wherein a process gas 

which contains sulphur hexafluoride (SF
6
) is used for the low-pressure plasma, 
characterised in that this process gas is kept substantially free from oxygen, that the 

plastics surface is kept free from fluorine deposits or infiltrations during pretreatment 
by adjusting the electrical power and maintaining a processing time of the 

pretreatment in the low-pressure plasma from 0.5 to 5 minutes at a processing 
pressure of 1.0 - 50 pascals. 
A process according to claim 1, characterised in that a process gas with a sulphur 
hexafluoride content of at least 50 % is used. 
A process according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that in addition to SF
6
 the 
process gas contains other gases which are free from oxygen, particularly inert gases. 
A metallised and/or lacquered plastics component having a pretreatment 
corresponding to the process according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in 

that the pretreated surface is free from fluorine and that the adhesion of the deposited 
metal and/or lacquer film withstands an adhesive tape test comprising a pull-off force 

of 7 N/cm. 
A metallised and/or lacquered plastic component, particularly a reflector, according 
to claim 4, characterised in that it consists of polycarbonate, particularly of 

polycarbonate with high temperature stability which is based on 
dihydroxydiphenylcycloalkanes.
