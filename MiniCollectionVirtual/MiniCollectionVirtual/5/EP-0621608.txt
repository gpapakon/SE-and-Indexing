<ABSTRACT>
A method for enhancing the dielectric properties of 
new or in-se
rvice electrical cable is disclosed, the method 
comprising supplying the interstitial void space of the 

cable's conductor with a water-reactive antitreeing agent 
having a diffusion coefficient of at least 1 x 10⁻⁷ 

cm²/second at 50°C. in the insulation of the cable and having 
an initial viscosity of ≦ 100 cP (mPa·s) at 25°C. The 

instant method provides a more symmetrical distribution of 
dielectric enhancing fluid in the insulation than prior art 

approaches and results in a significant reduction in cable 
treatment time.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for the 
enhancement of the dielectric strength of an electrical 
distribution cable. More particularly, the instant invention 
relates to a method of contacting the interior of the cable 
with a water-reactive antitreeing agent having a diffusion 
coefficient of at least 1 x 10-7 cm2/second at 50°C. in the 
polymeric insulation of the cable. A major problem associated with electrical 
distribution cable is its tendency, over a period of time, to 
fail due to the progressive degradation of its insulation. 
"Water treeing," is observed when the insulation material is 
simultaneously exposed to moisture and an electric field. 
This mechanism is much more gradual than electrical treeing, 
requiring an extended period of time to cause the degree of 
damage that affects the insulation characteristics of the 
distribution cable. However, since water treeing occurs at 
considerably lower electrical fields than required for the 
formation of electrical trees, this phenomenon is thought to 
be a leading cause of reduced service life of cables. As a partial answer to industry's desire to extend 
the useful life of existing underground cables, it has been 
found that certain tree retardants can be introduced into the 
cable's interior to partially restore the insulation 
performance. US-A No. 5,200,234, assigned to the assignee of the 
present invention, disclosed a method for restoration of 
in-service electrical cable. The cable is first positioned 
within a surrounding conduit and the space between the cable 
and the conduit is then filled with a homogeneous mixture of  
 
a silane antitreeing agent and a dielectric oil. The 
dielectric oil is completely miscible with said antitreeing 
agent and has a solubility in the polymeric insulation of the 
cable of less than 5 weight percent. This cable reclamation method is effective but 
typically requires a long exposure time to obtain a fully 
treated cable. As a consequence, a contractor might find it 
economically equivalent, or even advantageous, to completely 
replace a cable once it has deteriorated rather than avail 
himself of this restorative method. Applicants have extensively investigated the 
methods of US-A 4,766,011 and US-A 5,200,234 and have found 
them limited by a heretofore undisclosed phenomenon whereby 
the use of the suggested fluids of the patents results in a 
highly asymmetric treatment of the cable insulation. This 
asymmetry, which is further described infra, has been 
correlated to a lower level of
