<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a device for the identification of fingerprints by means of ultrasonics, the device consisting of an electronic analysis circuit, a hollow liquid-filled cylinder (1) of length L with a lid (2) and a baseplate (3), the speed of the ultrasonic waves through the liquid being c' and the lid (2) being made of a material through which the speed of the ultrasonic waves is c". The outside of the lid (2) is flat for use as the contact surface for the fingerprint. The inside is either convex (c'
<
c') or concave (c'
<
c'), the surface having a radius of curvature R for which the condition L=R/|(c"/c') -1| must be fulfilled. Located at the centre of the baseplate (3) is a single ultrasonic receiver whose surface extends over the smallest possible area. Disposed concentrically round this receiver is at least one annular ultrasonic transmitter.
