<ABSTRACT>
The module comprises a stainless sheet steel frame shaped to provide a rabbet (1) receiving double glazing (2) and a stiffener (3) for fixing the frame (1-3) and glazing (2) assembly into the supporting structure (5) of the facade. To enable direct fixing in the supporting structure (5), the stiffener (3) is linked with a stainless spring steel plate forming a leg (4) on the structure (5) and provides clip assembly to the fixed frame (1-3). The space between the rabbets of two adjacent modules is reduced to that required for housing a calibrated, preformed EPDM seal (9).

Module for the production of an all-glass
façade of the type called structural glazing,

comprising a framework made of stainless steel sheet
which is profiled so as to produce, on the one hand, a

rabbet (1) intended to receive a double glazing (2)
and, on the other hand, a stiffening element (3) with

one end bent in the form of a cramp towards the inside
of the module which is able to retain the assembly -

surround (1-3) and glazing (2) - in a metallic
supporting structure (5) of the façade, characterized

in that, for direct fixing of the module in the
metallic supporting structure (5), the end bent towards

the inside of the module in the form of a cramp is
associated with a first tab (4) made of stainless steel

which forms a spring nose borne directly by a tubular
profile of the metallic supporting structure (5) and

carries out the clipping of the fixed surround (1-3).
Module according to Claim 1, characterized in
that, in an opening surround (1'-3), the stiffening

element (3') is associated with a receiving profile
(10) made of stainless steel sheet borne by the

metallic supporting structure (5).
Module according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the double glazing (2) is arranged in the rabbet

(1) on a calibrated seal (6) which allows to produce
the section necessary for the special structural

glazing silicone (7) which is drawn around the entire
external and internal periphery of the rabbet (1). 
Module according to Claim 2, characterized in
that, to allow clipping of the module on the structure

(5), which bears the first tab (4) made of stainless
steel forming a spring nose carrying out the clipping

of the fixed surround (1-3), an elastically deformable
element is arranged against a web of the stiffening

element (3) .
Module according to Claim 4, characterized in
that the elastically deformable element, to allow the

clipping of the module on the structure (5) of the
first tab, constitutes the ends of a flat spring made

of stainless steel sheet in the shape of a chair and
riveted at its centre to the structure, the first end

of the spring serving for attaching the module and the
second end ensuring the elastic thrust.
Module according to Claim 5, characterized in
that it comprises, to allow clipping of the module on

the structure (5) equipped with the first tab (4) made
of stainless steel, a second tab (11) made of stainless

steel arranged in continuation of the first tab (4) so
as to form the spring noses of an elastically

deformable anchor, the first nose of which carries out
the clipping and the second of which facilitates

mounting of the assembly - surround and glazing (1-3).
