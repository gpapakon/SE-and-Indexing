<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns packed, fryable food products 
wherein a pre-portioned amount of food product is packed 

in a porous wrapping container provided with openings, 
enabling the passage of oil but preventing the passage of 

parts of the fried food product.

<DESCRIPTION>
Frying of fryable food products, in particular of snacks, 
is well known. Depending on the type of food products, two 
problems might arise:
 
The first problem is associated with the fact that the food 
product, when brought into the frying oil used for the 
frying, does not float but sinks to the bottom of the 
container in which the frying oil is heated. The fried food 
product is therefore difficult to locate in the frying oil, 
which might even lead to over-frying of the product. The second problem is associated with the lifetime of the 
frying oil. During frying of the food products, both when 
these products are provided with a coating layer comprising 
bread crumbs and when these products are provided with a 
coating layer originating from batter, parts of this 
coating layer will be removed and will contaminate the 
frying oil. When these parts are not removed quickly and 
completely, they will reduce the lifetime of the frying 
oil. In order to cope with the above-mentioned problems, 
the frying oils had to be filtrated at least once a day. A similar problem will occur during the frying of chips 
since the smaller chip particles cannot be sufficiently 
removed from the oil and will therefore contaminate the 
frying oil. The presence of the above-mentioned contaminations in 
frying oils can also cause small black stains to appear on 
the fried products; this is a nuisance, in particular when 
partially fried products are made, since the customer does 
not appreciate such products. We have now conducted a study in order to find a solution 
for the above-mentioned problems. This study has resulted  
 
in our invention. Accordingly, our invention concerns 
packed, fryable food products, preferably provided with a 
coating layer, comprising batter and/or bread crumbs 
wherein a pre-portioned quantity of the food products is 
packed in a closed, wrapping container of porous material 
provided with openings of such a size that, upon frying of 
the packed products, the oil can freely enter the packed 
food products while any material removed from the food 
products during frying remains within the wrapping 
container. Fryable food products that can be packed according to the 
invention include all kinds of fryable snacks, such as 
battered meat pieces, e.g. battered fish, such as fish 
fingers or fish fillets, battered chicken pieces or 
battered pork pieces; battered ragout, such as croquettes 
or rissoles; small rissoles served as appetizers 
(bitterballen), skewered slices of meatball alternated

Packed, fryable food products, preferably provided 
with a coating layer, comprising batter and/or bread crumbs 

wherein a pre-portioned quantity of the food products is 
packed in a closed, wrapping container of porous material 

provided with openings of such a size that, upon frying of 
the packed products, the oil can freely enter the packed 

food products while any material removed from the food 
products during frying remains within the wrapping 

container. 
Packed, fryable food products according to Claim 1, 
wherein the wrapping container is a net of 0.01-2 mm mesh 

size. 
Packed, fryable food products according to Claim 1 
or 2, wherein the wrapping container is made from metal 

wire, paper, cotton or sisal. 
Packed, fryable food products according to Claim 2, 
wherein the food product is a fryable food product 

provided with a coating comprising bread crumbs having a 
particle size of 0.1-5 mm. 
Packed, fryable food products according to Claim 1, 
wherein the wrapping container is a net of 0.05-5 mm mesh 

size. 
Packed, fryable food products according to Claim 5, 
wherein the fryable food product is provided with a 

continuous coating layer made from batter. 
Packed, fryable food products according to Claim 1, 
wherein the wrapping container consists of a perforated 

material with perforations of 0.01-5 mm diameter. 
Packed, fryable food products according to Claims 
1-6, wherein the wrapping container is a woven material of 

0.01-5 mm average mesh size. 
Packed, fryable food products according to Claims 1-8, 
wherein the wrapping container is provided with means of 

attaching the container to other means of positioning the 
container in the frying oil during frying. 
Packed, fryable food products according to Claims 
1-9, wherein the coating layer of the food product and/or 

the material used for the wrapping container has (have) an 
increased level of antioxidants. 
Method for prolonging the lifetime of a frying oil 
by preventing sedimentation from appearing in the frying 

oil by : 

i) packing a pre-portioned amount of fryable food 
products in a wrapping container of a porous material; 
ii) frying of the food products while these are being 
packed in the wrapping container; 
iii) removal of the fried food products by removal of 
the wrapping container from the oil.
