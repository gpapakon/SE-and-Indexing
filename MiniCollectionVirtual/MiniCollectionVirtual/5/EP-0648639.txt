<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a display arrangement (10) for motor vehicles with a first display (12) and a second display (18) designed as illuminated display, the illuminated display (18) being reflected on a reflective surface (14) placed in front of the first display (12), by means of which a plurality of displays of one display arrangement can be made visible for the vehicle driver independently of one another as a function of certain driving situations. For this purpose it is proposed that the reflective surface (14) be adjustable in its optical transmission.
