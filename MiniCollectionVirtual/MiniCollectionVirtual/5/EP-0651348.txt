<ABSTRACT>
According to an image processing method and 
apparatus of the present invention, an outline portion 

is extracted from input image data, and a pixel whose 
dot size is to be changed is extracted. The input image 

data is printed without any change, and the pixel whose 
dot size is to be changed is overlap-printed while the 

dot size is increased. Therefore, smoothing can be 
sufficiently performed in both the main scanning 

direction and the sub-scanning direction without 
increasing the dot density and decreasing the recording 

speed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image output
method and apparatus and, more particularly, to an image
output method and apparatus suitable for performing
image output by, e.g., an ink-jet system.Generally, an image output apparatus such as a
printer, a copying machine, and a facsimile apparatus
records, as an output image, an image consisting of a
dot pattern on a recording medium such as a paper sheet
or a plastic thin plate on the basis of input image
information.Such image output apparatuses can be classified
into an ink-jet system, a wire-dot system, a thermal
system, a laser beam system, and the like depending on
their recording methods. Of these systems, the ink-jet
system (ink-jet printer) ejects and flies ink droplets
(recording liquid) from the ejection orifices of a
recording head and sticks them to a recording medium,
thereby recording an image.Along with the recent spread of the image output
apparatuses, there have been strong needs for high-speed
recording, high resolution, high image quality, low
noise, and the like. The ink-jet printer is an image
output apparatus meeting these requirements. As one of values added, a high image quality has
been required in the image output apparatus of an
electrophotographic system in recent years, and various
smoothing techniques have been developed. To perform
smoothing, basically, the resolution of all image data
can be increased. However, when the resolution is
simply increased, the amount of data is considerably
increased.For this reason, a conventional method is mainly
used in which a target smoothing portion is extracted
from image data with a resolution of, e.g., 300 DPI, and
only the extracted portion is interpolated and drawn at
a dot density of, e.g., 600 or 1,200 DPI.The above method is disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos.
4,544,264, 4,625,222, 4,933,689, and the like.In U.S. Patent Nos. 4,544,264 and the like, the
prior-art invention has been made on the basis of the
characteristics of the electrophotographic technique.
More specifically, one of basic smoothing techniques,
the resolution of raster data is increased. A polygon
mirror is rotated at a higher speed than a normal speed,
and the density of a raster interval is increased,
thereby obtaining a higher resolution of the raster
data. Smoothing is performed by using this high
resolution and adding dots having a medium size or
density. However, the conventional method has the following
problems.The conventional smoothing processing is
appropriately used for the electrophotographic system
using
