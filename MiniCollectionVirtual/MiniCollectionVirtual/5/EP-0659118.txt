<ABSTRACT>
In a thermal transfer printing apparatus, a receiver sheet or ribbon (2) and a donor sheet or ribbon (3) are held adjacent one another and printing is effected by heating the donor (3) so that dye passes to the receiver (2). Heating of the donor (3) is effected through the receiver (2), preferably by a laser beam (6). Preferably, the receiver (2) is held stationary on a convex surface of a support plate (10). No flat field optics are then required when using a scanning laser beam, and the donor ribbon (3) may be easily replaced or wound on to allow for colour printing from differently coloured dye donor regions, without needing to re-register the receiver (2) each time.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a printing method 
and apparatus involving the thermal transfer of a dye 
from a donor to a receiver, including melt, diffusion 
and sublimation transfer, and especially, but not 
exclusively, to such a method and apparatus employing a 
laser as the thermal source. The term "dye" should be 
taken to cover dyes, inks and pigments. In a known type of thermal printer, a dyesheet and 
receiver sheet are held against one another, with the 
dyesheet between the receiver sheet and a laser source. 
The printer receives signals from, for example, video 
equipment, an electronic still camera or a computer, and 
controls the laser source accordingly to heat selected 
individual pixel areas of the dyesheet. This causes dye 
in the selected areas to transfer to the receiver sheet 
and form a desired print pattern. Commonly, the receiver sheet will comprise a 
substrate on which is mounted a layer of dye-receptive 
material, and the dyesheet will comprise a thin 
substrate supporting a dye donor layer and a laser light 
absorber layer, with the dye donor layer consisting of a 
thermally-transferable dye held in a polymeric binder 
and with the absorber layer comprising carbon black as a 
broad band absorber, or an absorber which absorbs at the 
particular wavelength of the laser. As an alternative, 
a single combined donor and absorber layer may be used. Additional coatings may be provided on the 
dyesheet, such as an adhesive subbing layer between the 
substrate and dye donor/absorber layers. Other coatings 
may comprise backing layers, mounted on the opposite 
side of the substrate from the donor layer, for 
improving the heat resistance, slip and handling 
properties of the dyesheet. These backings are  
 
particularly useful where the dyesheet is wound in a 
roll, and may tend to stick to itself. It is necessary for these additional coatings and 
the dyesheet substrate to be transparent to the laser 
radiation as, otherwise, little or no radiation would 
pass through to the absorber, insufficient heating would 
occur, and no dye transfer would take place. This restriction on the dyesheet materials can be 
problematic, as a balance must be struck between the 
transparency of the materials and their handling and 
other properties. Therefore, either or both the 
transparency and handling characteristics of the 
dyesheet are less than optimum, which means that the 
energy efficiency and speed of the printer and/or the 
ease of use of the dyesheet is reduced. GB-1284266 discloses a
