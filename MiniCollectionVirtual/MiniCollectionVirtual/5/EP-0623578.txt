<CLAIMS>
A process for the preparation of dichloroacetyl 
chloride by reaction of trichloroethylene with 

oxygen in the liquid phase and with irradiation with 
short-wave light in the presence of a nitrogen-containing 

base, which comprises the nitrogen-containing 
base being a secondary aliphatic or 

cycloaliphatic amine of the formula HNR
1
R
2
 in which 
R
1
 and R
2
 are identical or different and are an alkyl 
radical having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, where at least 

one of the radicals R
1
 and R
2
 has a tertiary structure, 
or R
1
 and R
2
 together with the nitrogen atom 
form a 5- to 10-membered ring which can be substituted 

by one or more alkyl (methyl) groups, where at 
least one of the carbon atoms adjacent to the nitrogen 

is a tertiary carbon atom, the nitrogen-containing 
base being employed in an amount of 0.001 

to 0.1% by weight based on trichloroethylene. 
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
nitrogen-containing base is N-isopropyl-t-butylamine, 

N-isobutyl-t-butylamine, N-2-methylbutyl-t-butylamine, 
N-2,3-dimethylbutyl-t-butylamine, 

N-2-ethylbutyl-t-butylamine, N-2-ethylhexyl-t-butylamine, 
2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine, 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidone 

or 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine. 
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
nitrogen-containing base is N-2-methylbutyl-t-butylamine, 

N-3-methylbutyl-t-butylamine, N-2,3-dimethylbutyl-t-butylamine 
or 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine.
