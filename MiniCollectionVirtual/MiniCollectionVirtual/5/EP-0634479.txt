<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns the improved stability of
certain bleaching agents in detergent compositions. In
particular it relates to the improved stability of
percarbonate bleach particles.Percarbonate bleach is currently being proposed as an
alternative to perborate bleach which has commonly been
used in detergent compositions in the past. Sodium
percarbonate is an attractive perhydrate for use in
detergent compositions because it dissolves readily in
water, is weight efficient and, after giving up its
available oxygen, provides a useful source of carbonate
ions for detergency purposes. However, one problem is that
percarbonate is less stable in granular detergents than
perborate. In particular this stability problem is more
apparent when water-insoluble silicates such as
aluminosilicates and/or clays are present in the
composition.Aluminosilicates and clays are common components of
granular detergents. Certain aluminosilicates are employed
most commonly for their ability to complex with metal ions 
such as calcium and magnesium which are present in hard
water, and certain clays are used for their ability to
impart softness to fabrics. However the presence of heavy
metal ions in these components is unavoidable.Particulate detergent components comprising clays have been
proposed in the prior art.GB 2 121 843, published on 8th April 1982 describes the use
of silicate as a binder for clay particles.
EP-A 340 004, published on 2nd November, 1989, describes
the use of anionic surfactant as the binder for clay
particles and also suggests that silicate may be used in
addition. The use of such particles in bleaching
compositions comprising perborate is disclosed.However, neither mentions the stability problems associated
with percarbonate bleach, or suggests ways in which this
problem may be solved.WO92/6163, published on 16th April, 1992, suggests that the
percarbonate stability problem arises predominantly from
the presence of heavy metal ions which catalyse the
decomposition of the percarbonate, and proposes to limit
such ions as well as to control moisture to inhibit the
catalysed degradation of the bleaching agent.
The application also mentions the possibility of coating
percarbonate with protective layer (including silicate),
and adding chelants to the compositions to immobilise the
heavy metal ions. However further improvements are still
sought which would allow improvemements in percarbonate
stability in formulations containing aluminosilicates
and/or clays, in order to give more flexibility to
form
