<ABSTRACT>
A hair dye composition which contains as developer substance at least one triaminohydroxypyrimidine mixed with 1,4-diaminobenzene and/or 1-methyl-2,5-diaminobenzene and at least one coupler substance selected from the group of resorcinol, 2-methylresorcinol, 2-chlororesorcinol and/or  alpha -naphthol. The use of this composition mixed with an oxidising agent produces dyeings with excellent lightfastness and long-lasting colour persistence.
