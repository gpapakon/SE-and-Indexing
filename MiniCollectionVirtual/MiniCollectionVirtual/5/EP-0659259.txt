<ABSTRACT>
An integrated, self-contained portable power and cooling system includes a combustion generator (137) and a scroll-type expander (221) driven by combustion gas discharged from the gas generator, wherein the expander is connected in driving relationship to a scroll air compressor (197) that provides compressed combustion air to the gas generator. Inlet air to the gas generator may be preheated by spent combustion gas discharged from the expander (221). A drive shaft (47) driven by the expander is connected to a fuel pump (44), an electrical generator (56), and a refrigerant compressor (8). The scroll refrigerant compressor (8) supplies refrigerant to a condenser evaporator cooling circuit (11, 14, 17, 20, 22) for cooling a zone directly or indirectly via an auxiliary cooling loop (29, 30) in heat exchange relationship with the evaporator. The system has application in a man-portable system capable of cooling an individual in a high temperature environment and supplying electrical power.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PORTABLE SELF-CONTAINED POWER AND COOLING SYSTEMBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention pertains to an integrated, self-contained power and cooling system that is sized and configured so as to be readily portable by an individual. More specifically, the invention pertains to a cooling system which utilizes a scroll-type engine to drive a scroll type air conditioning refrigerant compressor in a conventional compressor- condenser-expander refrigeration circuit. The system is adapted to develop a supply of cooling fluid and a source of electrical power that can be used for various purposes. For instance, the integrated power and cooling system of the present invention can be used in combination with a personal vest through which a coolant cooled by the refrigerant can circulate to cool the user. Such a vest cooling arrangement can be used, for example, to cool a person subject to heat exhaustion, cool a soldier operating in a tropical environment or to maintain desired body temperature for individuals who suffer from a lack of sweat glands to the extent that their bodies cannot adequately provide the necessary cooling function on their own. The electrical power generated can be used to operate communication equipment. 

 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention provides an integrated, self-contained, power and cooling system including a combustion gas generator, a scroll- type expander which uses the combustion gas to drive a scroll type air conditioning refrigerant compressor within a conventional refrigeration circuit to develop an output cooling flow, and wherein the entire system is contained within a compact housing such that the system may be readily portable by a human individual. The combustion gas generator includes a combustion chamber which is systematically supplied with a charge that is ignited. The products of combustion ("combustion gases") are discharged through a scroll expander including relatively orbiting meshed scroll elements to thereby drive the expander in orbital motion. The expander connected to a scroll type air compressor that, in turn, compresses the ambient air and supplies this compressed air to the gas generator for use as combustion air. The scroll-type expander drives a scroll-type refrigerant compressor in a conventional compressor -expander refrigeration loop, which includes a refrigerant compressor, a condenser and an evaporator connected in series. A supplemental or indirect fluid coolant loop is provided in heat exchange relationship with the
