<ABSTRACT>
A connector inspecting device that positively 
determines whether a metal terminal has been correctly 

inserted into the housing of the connector includes a 
slider provided in a checker housing in such a manner that 

it is movable and urged toward a connector by a 
compression spring. The slider includes a lance check pin 

protruded toward the connector and an electrical contactor 
that is integral with the lance check pin. When the 

connector is at a "normal position," the lance check pin 
goes in a lance bending space provided for a lance, so 

that the electrical contactor is electrically connected to 
the metal terminal. In the case where the metal terminal 

is set at a "half insertion position," the lance check pin 
abuts against the lance, which prevents the contact of the 

electrical contactor with the metal terminal.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a connector inspecting
device for detecting whether or not a metal terminal has
been satisfactorily set in a connector housing.A connector includes a connector housing that is
generally made of resin and metal terminals connected to
the end of an electrical wire, which is inserted into the
connector housing. Each of the metal terminals is fixedly
held with a lance (or an elastic locking pawl) extended
from the connector housing so that it may not come off the
connector housing. When each of the metal terminals is
inserted into the connector housing, the respective lance
is bent toward the lance bending space provided in the
connector housing. When the metal terminal has been
correctly inserted into the connector housing; that is,
when it is at a "normal position," the lance is
elastically restored to engage the metal terminal, so that
the metal terminal is prevented from coming off the
connector housing.However, the connector having the above-described
terminal retaining structure may suffer from the following
difficulty: When the metal terminal is inserted until the
lance is bent, some frictional force acts on the metal
terminal, thus falsely retaining the metal terminal. In
this case, the person inserting the metal terminal into
the connector housing may consider that the metal terminal
has been completely inserted into the connector housing,
and stop the insertion of the metal terminal.If the metal terminal is not inserted to the
"normal position" where it is engaged with the lance of
the connector housing, the metal terminal may come off
during the use of the connector. Hence, it is essential
to detect whether the metal terminal of the electrical
wire has been correctly inserted into the connector
housing. There have been proposed a variety of connector
inspecting devices. One example is disclosed by Japanese
Utility Patent Application Publication No. 47093/1987.
The connector inspecting device includes a connector
holder for holding a connector at a predetermined position
and lance check pins protruded toward the lances of the
connector held at the predetermined position. More
specifically, the lance check pins are extended toward the
lance bending spaces, and they are brought into contact
with the ends of the lances, which are positioned in the
lance bending spaces when the insertion of the metal
terminal into the connector housing is incomplete. Thus,
with the device, it can be determined whether or not the
metal terminal has been satisfactorily set in the
connector
