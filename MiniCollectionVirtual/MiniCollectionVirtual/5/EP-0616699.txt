Projector for demonstration and advertising purposes with a 
specimen holder (21) for a specimen with predetermined 

maximum dimensions and converging lens systems (1, 2) on the 
optical axis of the projector, one on the specimen side and 

the other on the image side, 
characterised in that
 the 
specimen holder (21) is designed to hold a three-dimensional 

object (0), the converging lens system on the image side 

incorporates a Fresnel lens (2), the length of the beam path 
measured along the optical axis (5, 6) between the two 

converging lens systems (1, 2) is essentially equal to the 
sum of their focal lengths, the diameter of the lenses in 

the converging lens systems (1, 2) is greater than the 
extension of the object (0) to be visualised measured 

transversely to the main axis (5) of the converging lens 
system (1) on the specimen side and the distance of the 

specimen-holder (21) from the converging lens system (1) on 
the specimen side is so small that the object (0) is 

visualised at least partially in the beam path behind the 
Fresnel lens (2) as a three-dimensional free-standing image 

(P). 
Projector in accordance with Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 
the converging lens system on the image side consists of a 

Fresnel lens (2), the focal length of which is greater than 
the focal length of the converging lens system (1) on the 

specimen side. 
Projector in accordance with Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in 
that,
 as an upright unit, it is designed with the specimen 
holder (21) at the bottom, the converging lens system (1) on 

the specimen side fitted above it, a reflector arrangement 
(3, 4; 30, 32) positioned above that and the Fresnel 

lens (2) fitted at the side next to the said reflector arrangement.  
 
Projector in accordance with Claim 3, 
characterised in that
 
the reflector arrangement consists of a partially 

transparent mirror-coated beam splitter (4) inclined at an 
angle to the main axis (5) of the converging lens system (1) 

on the specimen side and at least one plane mirror (3) 
positioned essentially transversely and/or parallel to the 

main axis (5) of the converging lens system (1) on the 
specimen side. 
Projector in accordance with Claim 4, 
characterised in that
 
the beam splitter (4) is positioned at an angle of 

approximately 35° to 55°, preferably 45°, to the main 
axis (5) of the converging lens system (1) on the specimen 

side. 
Projector in accordance with Claim 3, 
characterised in that
 
the reflector arrangement incorporates a first plane 

mirror (30) positioned at an angle of approximately 35° to 
55°, preferably 45°, to the main axis (5) of the converging 

lens system (1) on the specimen side. 
Projector in accordance with Claim 6, 
characterised in that
 
the reflector arrangement incorporates a second plane 

mirror (32), which is positioned in the beam path between 
the first plane mirror (30) and the Fresnel lens (2) and is 

inclined at an angle of approximately 35° to 55°, preferably 
45°, to its main axis. 
Projector in accordance with Claim 7, 
characterised in that
 
the second plane mirror (32) and the Fresnel lens (2) can be 

rotated as a unit (34) in relation to the converging lens 
system (1) on the specimen side and the first plane 

mirror (30) about an axis (x-x) positioned transversely to 
the main axes (5, 6) of the converging lens system (1) on 

the specimen side and of the Fresnel lens (2).  
 
Projector in accordance with one of Claims 3 to 8, 

characterised in that
 the reflector arrangement (3, 4; 30, 
32) and the Fresnel lens (2) can be pivoted as a unit (8) in 

relation to the converging lens system (1) on the specimen 
side about an axis (11) positioned transversely to the said 

lens system's main axis (5). 
Projector in accordance with Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 
the specimen holder is a turntable (21) that can be driven 

in rotation.
