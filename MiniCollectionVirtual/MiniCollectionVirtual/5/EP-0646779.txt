<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a device intended to provide an image of the heating caused by an electrical heating element (1) supplied with current via a power semiconductor (3) through which a current proportional to the supply current of the heating element (1) flows. The device is characterised in that it comprises a heat-conductor element (5) in thermal contact with the power semiconductor (3), and a heat-sensitive sensor (9) in thermal contact with the heat-conductor element (5) and arranged at a given distance (d) from the power semiconductor (3), this distance being a function of the thermal inertia, to be reproduced, of the heating element (1).

Device for providing the image of the heating produced by an electrical
heating element (1) supplied with current (I) via a power semi-conductor (3)

traversed by a current (I') proportional to the supply current (I) of the heating
element (1), characterized in that it comprises a heat-conducting element (5), in

thermal contact with the power semi-conductor (3), and a heat-sensitive sensor
(9), in thermal contact with the heat-conducting element (5), and disposed at a

given distance (d) from the power semi-conductor (3), this distance being a
function of the thermal inertia of the heating element (1) to be reproduced.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in that the heat-conducting
element is constituted by the cooling radiator, or dissipator (5), of the semi-conductor

(3).
Device according to one of the preceding Claims, characterized in that it
comprises means for adjusting the distance (d) separating the power semi-conductor

(3) from said sensor (9).
Device according to Claim 3, characterized in that the adjusting means are
constituted by an elongated slot (7) provided in the dissipator (5) allowing the

slide of means (11) for fixing said sensor (9).
