<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to method and 
apparatus for measuring reflux flow and controlling 
the operation of a distillation column. In many chemical processes it is desirable 
to condense vapor flow from a distillation column 
and reflux the condensate to the column in order to 
accomplish the desired separation. One such 
chemical process is for the manufacture of oxo-alcohols. 
In some cases this is accomplished by 
installing a condenser on top of the distillation 
column. The condensate from the condenser then can 
flow by gravity back to the top trays of the 
column. The advantage of this arrangement is 
reduced capital cost and operating cost because of 
the elimination of the need for reflux pumps, and 
consequently eliminating the power required to 
operate the pump(s) over the life of the system. Without a pump the condensate flow cannot 
be effectively measured because there is 
insufficient pressure drop available in the gravity 
flow line from the liquid accumulator section of the 
condenser back to the column to meet the minimum 
requirements of a differential pressure cell type 
measurement device. Accordingly up until now, when 
choosing to mount a condenser on top of the column 
it was then predetermined to operate the column 
without effective and useful measurement of the  
 
condensed liquid flow (reflux) from the condenser. 
The column operation, therefore, cannot be fully 
optimized for energy usage and product quality. Prior to the invention operators had to 
manage the column in a manual mode both during 
steady state operation and during upsets. The steam 
usage was higher than needed to achieve the desired 
separation since there was no way to optimize it. 
This excessive steam overloaded the condenser when 
the column feed rate stopped or significantly 
decreased. The prior art discloses methods and 
apparatus for controlling fractional distillation 
apparatus. Scovill U.S. Patent No. 2,398,807, issued 
April 23, 1946, is typical of the prior art. In 
Scovill, there is shown a fractionating column 
having a distilling chamber and a condensing chamber 
above the distilling chamber. A collector is 
arranged to catch liquid from the condenser and 
direct it into a calibrated chamber. The chamber is 
provided with a valve for opening and closing flow 
from the chamber. When it is desired to measure 
rate of flow of the reflux the chamber is closed and 
reflux is collected. The filling of the chamber may 
be timed by viewing through a sight glass and the 
rate of flow thus
