<ABSTRACT>
A shunted connector assembly (14) wherein the 
electrical connector (12) has a housing (22) with spaced 

contacts (18), each having an exposed contact portion 
along an open portion of a side wall (30) of the 

housing. A shell member (64) is mounted to the 
connector housing and a shunt contact support housing 

(66) is slidably mounted to the shell member. The shunt 
contact support housing is movable generally linearly 

between first and second positions. When the shunt 
contact support housing is in the first position, shunt 

contacts (68, 70) secured therein engage pairs of spaced 
contacts (18) of the connector. When the shunt contact 

support housing is in the second position, the shunt 
contacts are electrically isolated from the connector 

contacts. A spring (72) biases the shunt contact 
support housing toward its first position so that when 

the connector is disengaged from a mating receptacle 
connector (36), the shunt contact support housing is 

automatically moved to the first position wherein 
connector contact pairs are electrically commoned. When 

the electrical connector is mated with a receptacle 
connector, the shunt contact support housing comes into 

interfering engagement with structure (58) surrounding 
the recess (176) of the receptacle connector so that the 

shunt contact support housing is moved to the second 
position. During movement of the shunt contact support 

housing from its first position toward its second 
position, it is lifted away from the electrical 

connector so that the shunt contacts do not rub against 
the connector.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electrically shunting 
contacts in an unmated electrical connector and, more 
particularly, to a shunt assembly for use with an 
electrical connector or an electrical connector 
incorporating the shunt assembly wherein, upon 
disengaging the connector from a complementary mating 
receptacle connector, the shunt assembly is self-biased 
to engage contacts of the unmated connector so as to 
electrically common predetermined ones of the connector 
contacts, and upon mating the connector with the 
complementary mating receptacle connector the shunt 
assembly automatically disengages from the connector 
contacts. When a connector having a cable extending to a 
computer system is disconnected from a receptacle 
connector in a peripheral device, predetermined ones of 
the conductors of the disconnected cable must be 
electrically commoned within a limited time of being 
disconnected so as to prevent the computer system from 
powering down. This has traditionally been achieved by 
providing a complementary receptacle connector, mounted 
on a printed circuit board, for mating with the 
disconnected connector upon being disconnected from the 
peripheral device. Traces on the circuit board 
electrically common appropriate contacts of the printed 
circuit board receptacle connector and thus the 
corresponding cable conductors. As computers become 
faster and faster, the available time to achieve 
electrical commoning of the conductors of the 
disconnected cable has been significantly decreased. It would be desirable to have a shunt assembly 
which automatically provides electrical commoning of 
appropriate conductors of a cable upon the disconnection  
 
of the cable connector from a receptacle connector of a 
peripheral device. U.S. Patent No. 4,952,170 discloses one such 
assembly wherein the shunt contacts are supported in a 
housing which is pivotally mounted on the connector. 
The housing is spring biased in a direction wherein the 
shunt contacts common the appropriate connector contacts 
when the connector is disengaged. However, when mating 
the connector with a receptacle connector, the shunt 
contact housing must first be pivoted away from the 
connector contacts. While effective, the arrangement 
disclosed in the referenced patent is disadvantageous in 
two respects - first, it requires user manipulation to 
pivot the shunt contacts into an inoperative position 
when the connector is mated and, second, relatively 
large spacing between receptacle connectors is required 
to

<CLAIMS>
A shunt connector assembly (14) including: 
   an electrical connector (12) having a housing (22) 

with a plurality of spaced contacts (18) therein, said 
contacts each having an exposed contact portion along an 

open portion of a side wall of said housing; 
   a shell member (64) mounted to said connector 

housing (22); and 
   at least one shunt contact (68, 70) having means 

(134, 136, 138, 140) for engaging a surface of the 
exposed contact portions of each of a respective pair of 

said spaced contacts (18) of said connector (12), 
   said shunt connector assembly (14) characterized 

by: 
   a contact support housing (66) slidably mounted to 

said shell member (64) having said at least one shunt 
contact (68, 70) secured therein, said contact support 

housing (66) being movable relative said shell member 
generally linearly between a first position and a second 

position, including bias means (72) associated with said

housing (66) for providing a force to yieldably bias 
said contact support housing (66) toward said first 

position, wherein when said contact support housing (66) 
is in said first position, said shunt contact (68, 70) 

engages said pair of spaced contacts (18), and when said
