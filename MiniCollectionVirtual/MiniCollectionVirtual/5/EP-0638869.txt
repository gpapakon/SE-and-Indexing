<ABSTRACT>
There is specified a procedure for a high-resolution spectral analysis for multi-channel observations, by means of which procedure it is possible to detect ventricular late potentials in individual beats. The procedure further provides the basis for the spatial localization of pathological changes which are causally related to the formation of these late potentials. The applicability of the procedure according to the invention is not limited to the detection of ventricular late potentials, rather the procedure according to the invention can be applied, in a similar manner, to problems of radar or sonar technology, of astronomy and of the scanning of mobile radio channels, or to other problems of seismic or medical signal processing.
