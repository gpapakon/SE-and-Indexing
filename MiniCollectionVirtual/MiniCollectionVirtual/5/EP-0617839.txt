A method of making semiconductor components, characterized by the
following steps :


(a) producing a substrate (1) of binary or ternary III-V semiconductor
material which is not dissolvable by a given chemical action,
(b) epitaxially growing on said substrate an intermediate layer (2) of a
ternary III-V semiconductor material which has a molar fraction of

aluminium of at least 40 %, an atomic lattice parameter compatible
with that of the substrate and which is dissolvable by said chemical

action,
(c) epitaxially growing on said intermediate an active layer (3) of a
binary or ternary III-V semiconductor material which has a molar

fraction of aluminium of at least 30 %, said active layer having an
atomic lattice parameter compatible with that of the intermediate

layer,
(d) making, by etching and metallizing said active layer, a set of
semiconductor components (5), certain areas of the intermediate

layer being bared by said etching between said components or
groups of said components,
(e) applying on said set of semiconductor components and on said
exposed areas a protective layer (6) of a passivation material, or of

a photosensitive resin, which is resistant to said chemical action,
(f) etching said protective layer so as to bare the intermediate layer at
said areas between said components or between groups of said

components,
(g) fixing on the resulting assembly a common support plate (8) covering
and mechanically holding the components together, and
(h) separating the substrate, without dissolving it, from the
components or groups of components by dissolving the material of

the intermediate layer by said chemical action at the locations (7)
bared at step (f), letting the other materials unaltered, wherein a

rear face of the active layer (3) of said components or groups of
components is thus uncovered.
The method of claim 1, further including the following step :

(i) depositing a metallization (9) on said rear face of the active layer of
the components or groups of components uncovered by separating

the substrate at step (h).
The method of claim 1 or 2, further including the following step :

(k) separating the different individual components or groups of
components from said common support plate.
The method of claim 1 to 3, further including the following step :

(j) fixing a common support member (10) on said rear face of said
components or groups of components.
The method of claim 4, wherein said common support member carry
component interconnection lines.
The method of claim 4 or 5, wherein said common support member is
optically transparent and said components are optoelectronic

components.
The method of any one of claims 1 to 6, wherein said common
support plate carry component interconnection lines.
The method of any one of claims 1 to 7, wherein said common
support plate is optically transparent and said components are

optoelectronic components.
