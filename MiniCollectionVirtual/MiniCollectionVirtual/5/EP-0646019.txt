<ABSTRACT>
Methods, compounds, compositions and kits that relate to pretargeted delivery of diagnostic and therapeutic agents are disclosed. In particular, methods for radiometal labeling of biotin and for improved radiohalogenation of biotin, as well as related compounds, are described. Also, clearing agents, anti-ligand-targeting moiety conjugates, target cell retention enhancing moieties and additional methods are discussed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to diagnostic or therapeutic agent
conjugates for delivery to a target site by a target moiety.Conventional cancer therapy is plagued by two problems. The generally
attainable targeting ratio (ratio of administered dose localizing to tumor versus
administration dose circulating in blood or ratio of administered dose localizing
to tumor versus administered dose migrating to bone marrow) is low. Also, the
absolute dose of radiation or therapeutic agent delivered to the tumor is
insufficient in many cases to elicit a significant tumor response. Improvement
in targeting ratio or absolute dose to tumor is sought.The present invention provides certain biotin-DOTA conjugates as targeting moiety-ligands
useful in diagnostic and therapeutic pretargeting methods.
Selection of moieties and methodologies used to enhance internalization (of
chemotherapeutic drugs, for example) or to enhance retention at the target cell
surface (of radionuclides, for example) is also discussed. Prior to setting forth the invention, it may be helpful to set forth
definitions of certain terms to be used within the disclosure.Targeting moiety: a molecule that binds to a defined population of cells.
The targeting moiety may bind a receptor, an oligonucleotide, an enzymatic
substrate, an antigenic determinant, or other binding site present on or in the
target cell population. Antibody is used throughout the specification as a
prototypical example of a targeting moiety. Tumor is 
used as a prototypical example of a target in
describing the present invention.Ligand/anti-ligand pair: A complementary/anti-complementary
set of molecules that demonstrate
specific binding, generally of relatively high
affinity. Exemplary ligand/anti-ligand pairs include
zinc finger protein/dsDNA fragment, enzyme/inhibitor,
hapten/antibody, lectin/carbohydrate, ligand/receptor,
and biotin/avidin. Biotin/avidin is used throughout
the specification as a prototypical example of a
ligand/anti-ligand pair.Anti-ligand: As defined herein, an "anti-ligand"
demonstrates high affinity, and preferably,
multivalent binding of the complementary ligand.
Preferably, the anti-ligand is large enough to avoid
rapid renal clearance, and contains sufficient
multivalency to accomplish crosslinking and
aggregation of targeting moiety-ligand conjugates.
Univalent anti-ligands are also contemplated by the
present invention. Anti-ligands of the present
invention may exhibit or be derivitized to exhibit
structural features that direct the uptake thereof,
e.g.,
