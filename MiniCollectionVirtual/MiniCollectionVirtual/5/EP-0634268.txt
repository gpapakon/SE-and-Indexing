<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a male 
pot for presses for pressing cacao and oil seed, 

comprising a body provided, on the opposite 
surfaces thereof facing the press pots, with a 

ring/disc element rigid with the body and defining 
channels for draining therefrom the liquid portion 

separated by the pressed seed mass, a fine 
filtering cloth to be mounted on the edge of the 

press being associated with the ring/disc element.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a male 
pot for cacao and oil seed presses. As is known, hydraulic presses for 
pressing a mass of cacao and oil seed 
conventionally comprise a plurality of pressing 
chamber therethrough the material to be pressed is 
caused to pass by means of several systems, such 
as, for example, by pressure and gravity. The pressing chambers are formed by 
coupling male elements, the so-called male pots, 
and female elements, the so-called pots. On the two sides of the male element 
there are provided, in all of the existing 
presses, two disk elements which are called "filter 
bearing plates" and which can be interexchanged, on 
which there are mounted special filters called 
filtering cloth elements. The filtering cloth elements, depending 
on the press type, can be two or three and operate 
to filter the cacao butter or oil from the solid 
part. This operation is performed by applying 
to the cloth elements a high pressure, aiding the  
 
separation of the liquid material from the solid 
material. On the hydraulic press male pots of the 
existing presses there are applied two filtering 
plates, which can be connected to the male pot by 
different means, depending on the type of the 
press, that is on the maker of said press. The conventionally used connection 
systems comprise a threaded central pin, where the 
plate is threaded to the male pot, or three pins 
which are bayonet coupled on the male pot, or a 
central pin, which is affixed on the mail pot by a 
cross screw transversely extending with respect to 
the male pot. Said plates are connected to the press 
male pot in order to allow an easy disassembling 
and reassembling thereof. This latter operation, in particular, is 
very difficult, since on the plates there are 
mounted the filtering cloth elements which must be 
of interexchangeable type. The filtering cloth elements comprise a 
fine filtering cloth, that is that which will 
directly contact the product to be pressed and  
 
which applied on all of the different type of press 
plates, and the supporting cloth or clothes, which 
are assembled under the fine cloth for supporting 
the latter. In particular, in prior presses, the 
fine cloth is affixed to the plate, whereas the 
supporting cloth or clothes are held on the plate 
through the fine cloth. Because of this assembling configuration 
it is necessary to mount the cloth elements on the 
plate, that said plate be held in a horizontal 
position and, accordingly, in a horizontal plane 
and not on an edge of the

<CLAIMS>
A male pot for presses for pressing 
cacao and oil seed, characterized in that said male 

pot comprises a body provided, on opposite surfaces 
thereof facing said press pots, a ring-disc 

element, rigid with said body and defining channels 
for draining therefrom the liquid part separated 

from the pressed material, to said ring-disc 
element being applied a filtering cloth which can 

be assembled at an edge portion of the press. 
A male pot, according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that said ring/disc element 

defines at least a front flat portion provided for 
coupling with said filtering cloth. 
A male pot, according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that said ring/disc element is 

provided with connection means for connecting said 
ring/disc element to said body said connection 

means do not affecting said channels. 
A male pot, according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that said ring/disc element is 

provided, on an outer perimetrical portion thereof, 
with a tungsten carbide coating. 
A male pot, according to Claim 4, 
 

characterized in that said male pot further 
comprises, at a middle portion of said coating, a 

groove for engaging therein a felt element. 
A male pot, according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that said fine filtering cloth is 

supported by a small ring which is removably 
coupled to said ring/disc element. 
A male pot, according to Claim 6, 
characterized in that said small ring is provided 

with a top groove for coupling with a Sieger ring 
element which can be engaged in a bottom groove 

defined in said ring/disc element. 
A male pot, according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that said male pot can be fitted 

to existing presses.
