<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a piston - articulating
pin - connecting rod assembly for reciprocating
hermetic compressors and to a process for attaching an
articulating pin to a piston of a reciprocating
hermetic compressor employed in small machines, such as
refrigerators, freezers, drinking fountains, etc.The reciprocating compressors present a connecting rod,
having a smaller eye, which is articulated, through an
articulating pin, to a piston that reciprocates inside
the cylinder of the compressor, and a larger eye,
mounted to an eccentric end of a crankshaft, which is
orthogonal to the piston stroke, the other end of said
crankshaft supporting the rotor of an electric motor,
whereas the stator of the motor is supported on a
cylinder block, lodging the bearing of the crankshaft,
the block being mounted inside a case, by means of
springs, said case being closed by a cover, which
defines a sealed unit.In order to obtain a better performance of the
compressor, it is important, from the mechanical point
of view, that the parts with relative movement present
perfect adjustments of their geometries, so as to avoid
leakage, wear and tribological effects that lead to a
loss of volumetric yielding.The perfection in the geometry of the parts is
verified, for example, in the maintenance of the piston
cylindricity.Alterations in this characteristic of the piston affect
the operation of the compressor. The attachment between the pin and the piston in the
known techniques (mechanical mounting by interference,
resilient pin, gluing, etc.) affects the yielding of
the reciprocating compressors, mainly due to the
deformations caused by the loss of symmetry and to
problems that occur in the piston - pin - connecting
rod assembly and cylinder, said problems resulting in
vibrations, noises and loss of volumetric yielding
(leakages).The smaller the parts used in the mounting operation,
with more precision being required for such parts, the
more enhanced will be the above cited deficiencies.Among said known techniques, those which use additional
fastening components, such as pins and rings or bonding
material, as in the gluing technique, cause localized
tensions and, above all, unbalance in the piston - pin
- connecting rod assembly, which also impairs the
performance of the compressor.The conventional welding technique, besides presenting
the inconvenience of incorporating additional material
and causing residues, thereby deforming the piston
during the melting operation, should not be applied to
materials with
