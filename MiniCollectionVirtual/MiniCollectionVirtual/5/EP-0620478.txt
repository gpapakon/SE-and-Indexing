<ABSTRACT>
A digital audio signal recording device which, in conjunction 
with a film magazine for loading with a motion picture film and an 

analog audio recording device for recording analog audio signals on the 
motion picture film, constitutes an audio signal recording system for 

the motion picture film capable of recording both analog audio signals 
and digital audio signals on the motion picture film delivered from the 

film magazine. The digital audio signal recording device transports 
the motion picture film, delivered from the inside of the film magazine 

via the film reel-out section, into the digital audio signal recording 
device via a first film feed-in section, and then transports the film 

to the analog audio signal recording device via a first feed-out 
section and a film lead-in section. The motion picture film introduced 

into the analog audio signal recording device is returned into the 
digital audio signal recording device via a film lead-out section and 

a second film feed-in section. The digital audio signals are recorded 

in the digital sound track area on the motion picture film returned 
back into the digital audio signal recording device by a digital audio 

signal recording section provided in the digital audio signal recording 
device. The motion picture film, on which the digital audio signals 

have now been recorded, is delivered via a second film feed-out section 
towards the film magazine so as to be taken up in the film magazine by 

a film taker-in section.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to audio signal recording for motion
picture films. The invention provides a digital audio signal recording
unit for recording digital audio signals on a sound track on a motion
picture film for forming a digital sound track, and an audio signal
recording system in which the digital audio recording unit is combined
with an analog audio signal recording unit for recording analog audio
signals on the motion picture film for forming an analog sound track.
The digital sound track having the digital audio signals recorded
thereon and the analog sound track having the analog audio signals
recorded thereon may be simultaneously formed on one and the same
motion picture film. More particularly, the digital audio signal
recording unit can be combined with an analog audio signal recording
unit in such a manner that both the analog audio signals and the
digital audio signals may be recorded during travel of the motion
picture film from a film supply side to a film take-up side.Motion picture film is constituted by an area in which the
pictures have been recorded and an area in which the audio 
signals have been recorded. The pictures are discretely recorded
in a series of frames provided at the center along the length of
the motion picture film. The audio signals are usually recorded
on the motion picture film in the form of analog signals. The
audio signals, recorded in the state of analog signals on the
motion picture film, are recorded in an analog sound track area
provided between the frames dedicated to the pictures and a
series of perforations formed on both longitudinal edges of the
motion picture frame and adapted for being engaged by a feed
mechanism used for feeding the motion picture film.There has been proposed a motion picture film in which analog
audio signals are recorded after modulation into digital audio
signals. The digital audio signals may be recorded on the motion
picture film without being adulterated with noise components and
are not susceptible to deterioration in the playback audio
signals even on repeated reproduction of the motion picture film.
Sound reproduction of extremely high quality may be achieved by
employing digital audio signals as the audio signals recorded on
the motion picture film.If the digital audio signals are recorded on the motion
picture film in substitution for analog audio signals, the
digital signals are recorded in the analog sound track area in
which the analog audio signals are conventionally recorded.Some of the projectors used for

<CLAIMS>
A device (1) for recording digital audio signals for a motion
picture film (103) in which the digital audio signals are recorded on

the travelling motion picture film (103) reeled out from a film
magazine (101), the device comprising:


a first film feed-in section (12) provided at a position for
registering with a film reel-out section (109) of the film magazine (101) for feeding out the motion

picture film (103) loaded therein;
