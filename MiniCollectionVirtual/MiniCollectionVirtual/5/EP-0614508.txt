<ABSTRACT>
A free-piston engine having a fluid energy unit comprises a cylinder (1) and a piston (2) reciprocating within the cylinder (1). The piston (2) is equipped with a plunger-shaped extension (10) including a first axial face (50) moving within a chamber (30) when the piston (2) is moved. There are provided supply means (42, 43) for supply of liquid from a supply reservoir (34) to the chamber (30) and discharge means (36-40) for discharge of fluid from the chamber to an accumulator (33). The plunger-shaped extension (10) further comprises an axial face (49) opposite to the first axial face (50) and bordering a pressurized room (31) in the top dead centre of the piston (1). The hydraulic unit further includes a compression section (20) for making a compression stroke of the piston (1). The discharge means (36-40) include separate first and second discharge channels (37, 38) of which the first discharge channel (37) connects to the chamber (30) in such manner that a discharge of liquid from the chamber (30) to the accumulator (33) can take place only in a first part of the expansion stroke of the piston (1) and the first discharge channel (37) having a low flow resistance, the second discharge channel (38) connecting to a pressurized room in such manner that a discharge of liquid from this room to the accumulator can take place in a last part of the expansion stroke of the piston (2) and the second discharge channel (38) including a quickly closing non-return valve preventing a flow of liquid to the pressurized room.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a free-piston engine having 
a fluid energy unit according to the preamble of claim 1. In a known embodiment of such a free-piston engine 
(see EP-A-0 254 353), the supply and discharge means of the 
displacement chambers consist of a supply and discharge 
channel having a non-return valve. At the end of the movement 
of the piston from the second to the first position, that is 
at the end of the expansion stroke, the non-return valve of 
the discharge channel closes so that the pressure in the 
respective chamber becomes lower than the pressure in the 
accumulator together with the spring pressure of the valve. 
The closing action of the non-return valve should take place 
quickly because otherwise hydraulic liquid will flow back to 
the chamber which will cause the piston to move back to the 
second position along some distance, while it is the intention 
to retain the piston in its first position until a new 
compression and expansion stroke is required. The quick 
closing action of the non-return valve necessitates a high 
spring pressure in the non-return valve. This results, 
however, in a high flow resistance when hydraulic liquid flows 
through this non-return valve during the expansion stroke of 
the piston causing substantial flow losses. The object of the present invention is to provide a 
free-piston engine having a fluid energy unit of the type 
mentioned in the preamble in which this disadvantage is 
removed in an effective way. For this purpose the free-piston engine having a 
fluid energy unit according to the invention has the features 
of the characterizing portion of claim 1. Due to the features according to the invention, the 
discharge channel means having a low flow resistance are used 
during the first part of the expansion stroke so that low 
hydraulic losses occur. At the end of the expansion stroke, 
when the speed of the piston is reduced substantially, the 
first discharge channel means are put out of action and the 
discharge of hydraulic liquid from the chamber only takes 
place through the second discharge channel means having a 
quick non-return valve and a small waste volume. In this  
 
manner, both opposite objectives of low flow resistances and 
small rebound of the piston from the bottom dead centre are 
obtained in an effective way. NL-A-6 814 405 discloses a free-piston engine having 
a fluid energy unit, which comprises separate first and second 
discharge channel means operating in a first and second part 
of the expansion stroke,
