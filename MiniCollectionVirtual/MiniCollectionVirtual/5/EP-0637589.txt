<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to new organometallic
complexes of elements belonging to the group of
lanthanides, their preparation and their use in the
stereospecific polymerization of unsaturated monomers.A metal belonging to the group of lanthanides
means, as generally accepted in the known art, a metal
belonging to the group comprising: Scandium, having
atomic number 21, Yttrium, having atomic number 39,
and/or a metal having an atomic number of between that
of Lanthanium (57) and Lutezium (71); these metals form
part of group IIIA of the periodic table, according to
the IUPAC definition prior to the year 1985.It is known in the art that the halides of lanthanides
form a group of products used as precursors, both
for the preparation of a large number of organometallic
derivatives of lanthanides, and for the embodiment of
particular catalytic processes, such as for example the 
polymerization of unsaturated monomers.Their preparation is easy but their use is complicated
by their complete insolubility in all hydrocarbons
of any type, because they are characterized by
polymeric-type structure, with halogen bridges and
difficult to break.A complete description of the crystalline and
molecular structure of the halides of lanthanides can
be found in the well-known treatise on structural
inorganic chemistry edited by A.F. Wells "Structural
Inorganic Chemistry" published by Clarendon Press,
Oxford, 1975.However, precisely because of this compact structure,
when these halides are used as precursors in the
synthesis of organometallic derivatives, it is necessary
to resort to the use of basic-type reaction
solvents, such as ethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran, which
are capable of breaking their polymeric structure,
making them more vulnerable to the chemical reagents
with which they are to react.This technique cannot be used however when the
same halides are to be used in the preparation of
catalytic systems, such as in the case of polymerization,
in which the basic environment of the solvent is
not compatible with the reagents in use and with the 
catalysis mechanism.The known art describes an elegant method for
breaking the above polymeric structure of lanthanide
chlorides. This method consists in preparing complexes
having the general formula:
Me(Ar)(AlCl4)3
wherein: Me represents a metal belonging to the group
of lanthanides and Ar represents a substituted or non-substituted
benzene group.Valid preparative methods for derivatives wherein
Me is lanthanium, neodymium, samarium and X is chlorine,
are disclosed in
