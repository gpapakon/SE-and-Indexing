Laboratory test tube for the dosing of liquids, 
whereby the laboratory test tube (1) possesses 

markings (6) for the filling with the liquid, with 
which opening of the laboratory test tube (1) is 

connected a shortened inner tube (2), whereby, between 
laboratory test tube (1) and inner tube (2), is present 

a space with constant retention volume (7) in the case 
of the pouring out of the tube content, characterised 

in that the intermediate space has a width of at 
least 0.5 to maximum 1 mm. 
Laboratory test tube according to claim 1, 
characterised in that laboratory test tube (1) and 

inner tube (2) consist of recyclable synthetic material 
which are connected via a press connection. 
Laboratory test tube according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the inner tube (2) consists of 

a cylindrical tube, by the length and outer diameter 
of which and the inner diameter of the laboratory test 

tube (1) the retention volume (7) is defined, the 
inner tube (2) has on its upper end a thickening (3), 

the outer diameter of which corresponds to the inner 
diameter of the laboratory test tube (1), the inner 

tube (2) has a collar (4) which encompasses the opening 
of the laboratory test tube (1) and collar (4) and 

thickening (3) comprise a funnel-shaped filling 
opening (5).  

 
Use of laboratory test tubes according to one 
of claims 1 to 3 for the resuspension of the sediments 

obtained by centrifuging.
