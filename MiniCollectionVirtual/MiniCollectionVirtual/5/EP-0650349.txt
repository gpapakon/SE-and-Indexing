<ABSTRACT>
The female protection system of the present invention includes a menstrual short (28) having an outer protective layer (30) and an inner gusset layer (32). A catamenial pad assembly (50) is connectable to the menstrual short and includes front and rear ends. The catamenial pad assembly includes an absorbent member (52) for absorbing menses and a cinch (56) for biasing the absorbent member into the gluteal groove and against the perineum of the female when worn. A first fastener (70, 72) is provided on the front end of the catamenial pad assembly for attaching the catamenial pad assembly to a first mating surface that is provided at a front attachment location on at least one of the inner gusset layer and the outer protective layer. A second fastener (78) is provided on the rear end of the catamenial pad assembly for attaching the catamenial pad assembly to a second mating surface that is provided at a rear attachment location on at least one of the inner gusset layer and the outer protective layer. The front and rear attachment locations are positioned to cause the cinch to bias the absorbent member of the catamenial pad assembly into the gluteal groove and against the perineum of the female when worn.

<DESCRIPTION>
 MENSTRUAL SHORTS HAVING IMPROVED FASTENING SYSTEMBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Technical FieldThis invention relates generally to feminine menstrual protection devices and, more particularly, to a catamenial pad assembly that is attachable to menstrual shorts for inhibiting the leakage of menses.2. Background ArtAs is known, disposable catamenial pads are commercially available in a wide variety of configurations for the specific purpose of absorbing and retaining menstrual fluids and other vaginal discharges. Unfortunately, a primary failure mechanism associated with catamenial pads is the leakage of menses from a rear portion thereof due to poor fit in the gluteal groove and against the perineum of the female wearer. Such leakage is most prevalent during night time use of catamenial pads and typically results in soiling of the female wearer's undergarments, clothing and bedding.To provide additional protection against leakage, it is known to use a washable and reusable garment, such as a menstrual short or parity, in combination with a disposable catamenial pad. For example, U.S. Patent3,489,149 to Larson discloses a washable menstrual panty having a small pocket in the crotch area for retaining a disposable catamenial pad. Since the menses must initially flow through a layer of material forming the pocket to reach the catamenial pad, removal of the soiled catamenial pad can be distasteful, difficult and unsanitary. While a new pad can be inserted into the pocket, the garment is already soiled and would typically be changed. Also, the pocket may not accommodate the varied sizes of catamenial pads currently on the market. Finally, the menstrual panty is not adapted to deliberately position the catamenial pad for preventing leakage of menses from the rear portion thereof.Various other menstrual shorts or panties are known which also fail to adequately address the need for properly positioning and retaining the 

disposable catamenial pad in the pudendal region of the female wearer. For example, U.S. Patent 4,560,381 to Southwell describes a mesh-like outer panty shell with a thick inner layer of absorbent material in the lower crotch area of the panty. The inner layer of absorbent material includes a depression for receiving and positioning a catamenial pad. In U.S. Patent 4,813,950 to Branch, a washable menstrual panty is disclosed as having an outer lining of spandex, soft tricot, etc. and an inner lining of soft plastic film to prevent passage of menses therethrough.

What Is Claimed Is:
1. A feminine protection system for preventing leakage of menses comprising: a menstrual short including an outer protective layer and an inner gusset layer; a catamenial pad assembly connectable to the menstrual short and including front and rear ends, an absorbent means for absorbing menses, and a cinch means for biasing said absorbent means into the gluteal groove and against the perineum of the female when worn; first fastening means for attaching said front end of said catamenial pad assembly to a front attachment location provided on at least one of said inner gusset layer and said outer protective layer; and second fastening means for attaching said rear end of said catamenial pad assembly to a rear attachment location provided on at least one of said inner gusset layer and said outer protective layer; wherein said the front and rear attachment locations are positioned such that said cinch means biases the absorbent means of said catamenial pad assembly into the gluteal groove and against the perineum of the female wearing said menstrual short. 

2. The female protection system of Claim 1 wherein said front attachment location is positioned at least anterior to the anus of the female wearing said menstrual short.
3. The female protection system of Claim 2 wherein said front attachment location is positioned adjacent the vaginal vestibule of the female wearing said menstrual short.
4. The female protection system of Claim 1 wherein said rear attachment location is positioned at least 2.75" from a lowest portion of said outer protective layer when said menstrual short is folded flat along first and second lateral sides thereof.
5. The female protection system of Claim 1 wherein said rear attachment location is positioned adjacent a rear waistband portion of said menstrual short.
6. The female protection system of Claim 1 wherein said cinch means is made of an extensible material.
7. The female protection system of Claim 1 wherein said cinch means is made of a stretchable material.
8. The female protection system of Claim 7 wherein the stretchable material has greater elasticity than said menstrual short.
9. The feminine protection system of Claim 1 wherein said catamenial pad assembly further includes a backsheet, wherein said first fastening means is provided on a front end of said backsheet for attachment to said front attachment location. 


 10. The feminine protection system of Claim 9 wherein said second fastening means is provided on said rear end of said cinch means for attachment to said rear attachment location.
11. The feminine protection system of Claim 1 wherein said absorbent means is a disposable catamenial pad having third fastening means for attaching said catamenial pad to said cinch means.
12. The feminine protection system of Claim 1 wherein said first and second fastening means are adhesive patches.
13. The feminine protection system of Claim 1 wherein said first and second fastening means are hook and loop fasteners.
