<ABSTRACT>
The control system is for an IC engine. Adjustment of a min. air volume flow is independent of the position of the accelerator pedal. Ignition timing is retarded, so that undesired power excess caused by the additional air volume flow is compensated for, and an even momentum is achieved. The ignition timing adjustment to retarded is reversed, and the min. air volume flow adjustment is cancelled, if a preset fuel volume has been injected since starting. The min. airflow is adjusted by a valve, located in a bypass around the throttle flap. The valve is closed, when the set injection fuel volume is achieved.

Method for operating a vehicular internal combustion
engine comprising


an inlet system having a system for measuring or
calculating the air mass, a throttle adapted to be

operated by an accelerator pedal at will, and an
electronic fuel injection system, inter alia controlled

in response to the air volume flow,
means for adjusting the ignition timing and
an exhaust system having a catalytic converter, wherein
at starting the internal combustion engine there is

provided a minimum air volume flow required for quick
heating of the catalytic converter by adjusting an

additional air volume flow in said inlet system and the
ignition timing is adjusted so as to be retarded and

after reaching a predetermined operational condition the
retarding of the ignition timing is withdrawn and the

adjustment of the minimum air volume flow is terminated,

characterized in that 

the adjustment of the minimum air volume flow is effected
independently of the position of the acceleration pedal

even if the internal combustion engine is not idling and
the ignition timing is adjusted so as to be delayed such

that the unintended excess performance produced by the
additional air volume flow is compensated,
and that the retarding of the ignition timing is
withdrawn and the adjustment of the minimum air volume

flow is terminated when a predetermined amount of fuel
has been injected after the start.
Method as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that
the additional air volume flow is adjusted via a valve in

a bypass passage bypassing the throttle and that this
valve is closed when the predetermined amount of injected

fuel is reached.
Method as claimed in claim 2, characterized in that
the additional air volume flow is adjusted by positioning

the throttle independently of the position of the
acceleration pedal and that such positioning is withdrawn

when the predetermined amount of injected fuel is
reached. 
Method in one of claims 1 and 3, characterized in that
the withdrawal of the retarding, the closing of the

valves or the withdrawal of the positioning of the
throttle, respectively, is effected gradually, when the

predetermined amount of injected fuel is reached.
Method as claimed in one of claims 1 and 4,
characterized in that the retarding of the ignition

timing is in any case withdrawn after reaching a
predetermined cooling water temperature, after expiration

of a predetermined period of operation with higher load
or after acceleration of the vehicle on a predetermined

value.
