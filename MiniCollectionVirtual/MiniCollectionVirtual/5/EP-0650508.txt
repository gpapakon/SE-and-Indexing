<ABSTRACT>
A cellulose formate-based composition for preparing fibres or films, comprising one or more compounds selected from the group consisting of alkylsulphoxides, lactams, acyclic amides and cyclic urea derivatives as the solvent. A method for preparing said fibres and films, and a regenerated cellulose fibre with a degree of formate group substitution lower than 3 %, for use in textile applications or in reinforcing tyre treads, are also disclosed.
