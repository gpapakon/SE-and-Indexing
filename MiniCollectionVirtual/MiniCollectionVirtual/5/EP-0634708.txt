<ABSTRACT>
A fuser apparatus for heat fusing toner images to print substrates, comprising an 
elongated fuser roll (34) and an elongated pressure roll (36). The pressure roll is supported for 

pressure engagement with the fuser roll to form a nip (65) therebetween adapted to receive 
substrates (82). An oil impregnated web material (77) and an elongated pinch roll (79) are 

provided. The pinch roll (79) has an outer surface mounted against the web material (77) to 
urge the web material into contact with the fuser roll (34) to apply release material to the fuser 

roll. The outer surface of the pinch roll (79) is of an open celled foam material, and is of greater 
diameter in the central portion of the roller than at the end portions. The pinch roll thus 

applies a greater pressure to the web (77) over the central portion than at the end portions, 
and therefore applies more release material over the central portion of the fuser roll than over 

its end portions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for applying offset preventing liquid to
the fuser roll of a fuser apparatus according to the preamble of claim 1.In imaging systems commonly used today, a charge retentive surface is typically
charged to a uniform potential and thereafter exposed to a light source to thereby selectively
discharge the charge retentive surface to form a latent electrostatic image thereon. The image
may comprise either the discharged portions or the charged portions of the charge retentive
surface. The light source may comprise any well known device such as a light lens scanning
system or a laser beam. Subsequently, the electrostatic latent image on the charge retentive
surface is rendered visible by developing the image with developer powder referred to in the
art as toner. The most common development systems employ developer which comprises both
charged carrier particles and charged toner particles which triboelectrically adhere to the
carrier particles. During development, the toner particles are attracted from the carrier
particles by the charged pattern of the image areas of the charge retentive surface to form a
powder image thereon. This toner image may be subsequently transferred to a support surface
such as plain paper to which it may be permanently affixed by heating or by the application of
pressure or a combination of both.In order to fix or fuse the toner material onto a support member or substrate
permanently by heat, it is necessary to elevate the temperature of the toner material to a point
at which constituents of the toner material coalesce and become tacky. This action causes the
toner to flow to some extent onto the fibers or pores of the substrate or otherwise upon the
surfaces thereof. Thereafter, as the toner material cools, solidification of the toner material
occurs causing the toner material to be bonded firmly to the substrate.One approach to thermal fusing of toner material images onto the supporting
substrate has been to pass the substrate with the unfused toner images thereon between a pair
of opposed roller members at least one of which is internally heated. During operation of a
fusing system of this type, the substrate to which the toner images are electrostatically adhered
is moved through the nip formed between the rolls with the toner image contacting the
heated fuser roll to thereby effect heating of the toner images within the nip. Typical of such
fusing devices are two roll systems wherein the fusing roll is coated with a compliant

Apparatus for applying offset preventing liquid to a fuser roll (34) comprising:

a web material (77) having offset preventing liquid impregnated therein; and
an elongated pinch roll (79) of open cell foam material having an outer surface mounted in
engagement with said web material (77) to urge said web material into contact with the fuser roll

(34) to apply the offset preventing liquid to the fuser roll (34), characterised in that said pinch roll
(79) has a first uniform diameter over a first region to apply a first pressure over a first region of the

web material (77) and a second uniform diameter over a second region contiguous to the first region
to apply a second pressure over a second region of the web material (77), so that the web material (77)

applies a greater amount of offset preventing liquid to the fuser roll (34) over the first region than
over the second region.
The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the first region of said pinch roll (79) comprises a
central portion thereof, and the second region of said pinch roll (79) comprises opposed marginal

end portions.
The apparatus of claim 2, wherein the central portion of said pinch roll (79)
comprises a greater diameter than the opposed marginal end portions thereof.
The apparatus of claim 3, wherein one of the opposed marginal end portions
extends in a longitudinal direction a length greater than that of the other opposed marginal end

portion of said pinch roll (77).
The apparatus of claim 4, wherein the opposed marginal end margins are of
substantially equal diameters.
An apparatus for fusing toner (81) to a print substrate (82), comprising : a fuser roll
(34); a pressure-roll (36), forming a nip (65) with said fuser roll (34) adapted to receive the substrate (82);

and means for applying offset preventing liquid to the fuser roll (34) comprising the apparatus of any
one of claims 1 to 5.
