<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a hay-making machine for swathing (windrowing) fodder, including a frame (1) which supports at least one rotor (head) (2) which has a casing (12) mounted by means of roller bearings (17) on a substantially vertical support shaft (7) unable to rotate, the said casing (12) bearing tool arms (25) which can rotate on themselves and are controlled by means of an immobile cam (18), this casing (12) being driven in rotation during operation about the support shaft (7). It is noteworthy in that the casing (12) includes, with a view to driving it, a cylindrical toothed wheel (30) which is fixed to a hub (15) of the casing (12) and is situated beneath the housing (5) integral with the frame (1), which cylindrical toothed wheel (30) meshes with a second cylindrical toothed wheel (31) located on a driveshaft (32) substantially parallel with the support shaft (7) of the casing (12).

 that a bevel gear wheel
(48) is mounted to rotate freely on the drive shaft (32), that a dog coupling

(68) is connected in terms of rotation to the said drive shaft (32) by means of
grooves (52) over which it can be moved longitudinally and that this dog

coupling (68) comprises, on its flank facing towards the said gear wheel (48),
teeth (71) which can mesh with teeth (72) provided on this gear wheel (48).
Machine according to Claim 6, 
characterized in
 that it comprises means (68,
73, 74) for interrupting the driving of the rotor (2) and/or braking its rotation.
Machine according to Claim 7, 
characterized in
 that the dog coupling (68)
comprises a tapered part (73) with fittings (74) for braking.

characterized in
 that the tapered part (73) lies
in a housing (75) of the same shape provided in a cover (41) of the box (5).
Machine according to Claim 6, 
characterized in
 that it comprises a spring
(76) which pushes the dog coupling (68) towards the gear wheel (48) which

is mounted to rotate freely on the drive shaft (32).
Machine according to any one of Claims 6 to 10, 
characterized in
 that it
comprises means (68, 69, 70, 77 to 82) for interrupting the rotational driving

of the rotor (2) from a guard (62). 
Machine according to Claim 11, 
characterized in
 that it comprises a fork
(69) and a rod (70) for moving the dog coupling (68) longitudinally along the
