<ABSTRACT>
The toothbrush has brush heads integrally disposed perpendicularly on opposite ends of a common handle. One brush head (12,18) has a concave shaped bristle surface connected to a bent end (16) of the handle and the other (13,19) with a convex shaped bristle surface is connected to the other end (17) to form a T-shape. Both brush heads slide tightly along a pair of tongues of the brush head holders integrally and perpendicularly attached to each end of the common handle. Thus the toothbrush heads stay in position while being used. Both heads have a pair of channels at their sides and a groove at their centre along their length with a slot at the centre to make them slidable, to their corresp. holders.

IMPROVED TOOTHBRUSH
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
 This invention relates to an improved toothbrush for which Patent No. 17574 was issued to me by the Philippine Patent Office October 1, 1984.


This toothbrush deals with the positioning of two toothbrush heads, the longer one with a concave-shaped bristle surface made longer than the other, which has a convex shaped bristle surface.


 One embodiment of this invention permits the two brush heads to be integrally and perpendicularly connected at their mid-section to each end of their common handle made either firm or foldable. The other embodiment permits the longer brush head to be slidably attached to the brush head holder integrally and perpendicularly attached to the end of its handle.


 While, in the said patent, the shorter brush head is attached to the bent end of said handle, this time, it is attached to the straight end of the same common handle, to permit a more convenient and more efficient brushing of the lingual surface of and the chewing surfaces of the teeth.


 While, in the said patent, only the longer brush head was slidably attached to the brush head holder fixed perpendicularly to its handle, this time, the shorter brush  head was also made slidably attached to the brush head holder, likewise, fixed at the straight end of the same handle to readily permit the cleansing of the lingual and chewing surfaces of the teeth.


 While, in the said patent, the slidable brush head and the brush head holder are not provided with an interlocking device, this time, these two slidable brush heads and their respective brush head holders are correspondingly and integrally provided with such device to prevent these brush heads from being thrown off while being used in brushing the teeth.


PRIOR ART
 The toothbrushes being used today have their single toothbrush head permanently disposed in line with their handle, so that, their users have the tendency to brush the labial surfaces of their teeth, specially the left and right posterior teeth horizontally or, often times, not in the manner specifically prescribed by dentists.


Because of their design or configuration, the cleansing of the lingual surfaces of the teeth is done minimally, if not out-right neglected, specially so, when users are in a hurry. This manner of cleansing their teeth, which has been formed as a habit, is very common to working parents as well as, to school children or students.


OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION
 The general object of this invention, therefore, is to provide its

CLAIMS



 1. An improved toothbrush having brush heads integrally disposed perpendicularly on opposite ends of their common handle (26), one brush head (12, 18) with concave-shaped bristle surface connected to a bent end (16) of said handle while the other brush head (13,
 19) with convex-shaped bristle surface is connected at the opposite straight end (17) of the handle to form a T-shaped configuration.




 2. An improved toothbrush wherein both brush heads (18, 19) are made to slide tight enough, along the pair of tongues of the brush head holders (20, 21) integrally and perpendicularly attached to each end of the common handle (26) permitting these toothbrush heads to steadily stay in position while being used.



 3. An improved toothbrush as in claim 2 wherein both brush heads (18, 19) are provided with a pair of channels (22, 23) at their sides and a groove (24) at their center along their length with a slot (25) at the center thereof thereby making them slidably connected to their corresponding brush head holders (20, 21) integrally and perpendicularly connected at their mid-section to their common handle (26), said holder having a pair of tongues (27, 28) to which the pair of channels are interconnected and a stud (29) that rides along the said groove firmly positioning itself in the slot provided for locking the said brush heads to the said brush head holders thereby totally preventing these brush heads from slipping off   vhile    the said toothbrush is being used.


 

 4. An improved toothbrush as in claims 1 and 2, wherein each brush head has a separate handle (35, 36) which are connected pivotally at their opposite ends (37, 38) making said handle (34) foldable.
