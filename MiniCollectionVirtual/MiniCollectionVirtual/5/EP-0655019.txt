<ABSTRACT>
A device is described for sawing a component made from a hard and/or fragile material by relative movement of said component (3) and a web of parallel wires (1), the web being capable of continuous or reciprocating linear motion between at least two wire guide cylinders (2, 2'), one of which is driven in rotation. The cylinders and one or more of the other components of the device are made in part or entirely of a material having an expansion coefficient of less than 5.10
