<ABSTRACT>
An alloy which contains an element having a reducing process and 
whose melting point is lower than that of each of a first joined member 

made of Titanium-Aluminum (Ti-Al) intermetallic compound and a 
second joined member made of metal is made to lie between the first 

and second joined members. Then, the first and second joined members 
and the alloy are heated so that the first joined member is joined to the 

second joined member. According to this method of joining Ti-Al 
intermetallic compounds, it is possible to join both joined members in 

an atmosphere without causing a reaction between Al, Ti contained in 
the Ti-Al intermetallic compound and atmospheric oxygen.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of joining Titanium-Alminum
intermetallic compounds (hereinafter, Titanium-Alminum intermetallic
compounds say Ti-Al intermetallic compounds), and more particularly
to a joining method between a first joined member made of a Ti-Al
intermetallic compound and a second joined member made of metal.A conventional method of this kind is disclosed in Japanese patent
application laid-open publication No. 4(1992)-288984. According to this
method, a Ti-Al intermetallic compound and a super plastic alloy made
of Titanium (Ti) or Alminum (Al) which is piled up on the Ti-Al
intermetallic compound are pressurized in a vacuum or an atmosphere
of inert gas at the heating temperature 400-1000Â°C. Thereby, the super
plastic alloy is made to be deformed non-elastically and both are joined.
In this method, since the Ti-Al intermetallic compound and the super
plastic alloy are joined in an atmosphere of non-air, in case that an
joining surface of the Ti-Al intermetallic compound or the super plastic
alloy reached a high temperature, it is able to prevent that Ti or Al
contained in the Ti-Al intermetallic compound or the super plastic alloy
reacts on atmospheric oxygen.In the above prior method, however, a vacuum tub or a vacuum 
container is indispensable to the joining and furthermore a step for
evacuating the vacuum tub or for making the inside of the vacuum tub
an atmosphere of inert gas is required. Thereby, the man-hour and the
manufacturing costs are increased as compared with the method which
the joined members are joined in the atmosphere.
Furthermore, since the Ti-Al intermetallic compound and the super
plastic alloy made of Ti or Al are joined by means of that the super
plastic alloy is made to be deformed non-elastically, burrs are always
formed in the vicinity of the joining surfaces. Thereby, a step for
removing the burrs is required and therefore the man-hour is
increased.It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide an
improved method of joining Ti-Al intermetallic compounds which
overcomes the above drawbacks.It is another object of the present invention to provide an improved
method of joining Ti-Al intermetallic compounds which can prevent that
Ti or Al contained in the Ti-Al intermetallic compound reacts on
atmospheric oxygen at the joining in an atmosphere.In order to achieve these objectives, there is provided a
method according to claim 1. Additional objects and advantages of the present invention will become
more apparent from the following

compounds, in which


the following steps are being taken;
preparing a first member (21) made of Titanium-Aluminium
(Ti-Al) intermetallic compound, a second member

(22) made of metal and
heating the first and second members (21, 22) in order
to join the first member (21) to the second member

(22),
characterized by

the following steps:

preparing an insertion-alloy (23) made of a nickel-chromium
alloy (Ni-Cr alloy) whose melting point is lower

than that of each of the first and second members (21, 22)
and which contains Boron and Silicon

as reducing elements and Carbon (C);
laying the alloy between the first and second members
(21, 22) and
heating the alloy (23) together with the first and
second members (21, 22) by a resistance heating or a high

frequency heating in the atmosphere at a temperature above
the melting point of the alloy (23) but below the melting

points of the first and second members (21, 22).
Method according to claim 1,
characterized in that

the insertion-alloy further contains Manganese (Mn), and Aluminium
(Al) as elements having a reduction process.
