<ABSTRACT>
Device, for shop windows or the like, for locking together an elongate upright (4) of a load-bearing structure (3) which supports a glazed wall (6, 7, 8) and a glazing bar (glazing bead) (10, 11) which is generally batten-shaped and extends parallel to the upright, having a preferably flat part (26) positioned against the glazed wall and so that it bears on the opposite face of the latter to that facing the upright of the structure. According to the invention, this device is characterised in that the glazing bar includes an extended part (30) which extends perpendicularly to its flat part and engages in an opening made in a housing (22) in the facing upright, this extended part having an internal screw thread (38) which engages with a clamping screw (35), the body (36) of which screw passes through the bottom of the housing, which is opposite the side with the opening accommodating the extended part of the glazing bar, and the head (39) of which screw bears on a supporting surface (16) of the upright, such that rotation of the screw causes the glazing bar to be brought closer to the upright until the two elements are locked together on both sides of the glazed wall. The invention also applies to shop windows equipped with these devices.

Device providing locking between an elongate 
upright (4) of a bearing structure (3) for a glazed wall 

(6, 7, 8) pressed against this bearing structure and a 

moulding (10, 11) in the overall shape of a strip extending 
parallel to the upright, exhibiting a preferably flat 

part (26) arranged against the glazed wall bearing on the 
opposite face thereof to the upright of the structure, 

the moulding including an extension (30) extending at 
right angles to its preferably flat part and engaging in 

an opening formed in a housing (22) of the upright 
provided opposite, in which this extension is, on the one 

hand, provided with an internal thread (38) with which 
there interacts a clamping screw (35) the body (36) of 

which passes through the bottom of the housing opposite 
its opening accommodating the extension of the moulding 

and the head (39) of which bears on a bearing surface 
(16) of the upright so that rotating the screw causes the 

moulding to be drawn closer to the upright until they are 
mutually immobilized on each side of the glazed wall and, 

on the other hand, this extension has the form of a 
tubular sleeve (31) which can be engaged coaxially inside 

the housing (22) of the upright (4) which have the same 
profile, characterized by this extension including, at 

its end (32) which penetrates the housing (22), a projecting 
external collar (33) which can be fixed like a 

clip onto a rib (34) which stands proud and is provided 
in the internal wall of the housing at the end of the 

travel which draws the moulding and the upright (4) 
closer together.  

 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the head (39) of the clamping screw (35) is pressed 

against the bottom of an open recess (15) provided in the 
upright (4), forming the bearing surface (16) for this 

screw, the recess comprising a central passage (17) 
through which the body (36) of the screw passes. 
Device according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the recess (15) accommodating the head (39) of the 

clamping screw (35) can be closed by a cover (40) engaged 
therein, concealing the head from the outside of the 

upright (4). 
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the moulding (10) includes, in its 

flat part (26) some distance from its extension (30), 
sealing gaskets (29) mounted in immobilization claws (28) 

delimited in the sides of the moulding (10), these 
gaskets being pressed against the external surface of the 

glazed wall (6, 7, 8). 
Device according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that the upright (4) includes similar immobilization 

claws (18) for analogous sealing gaskets (19) pressed 
against the opposite internal surface of the glazed wall 

(6, 7, 8). 
Shop windows or the like, characterized in that 
they include a glazed wall borne by an internal support 

structure and against which there are pressed mouldings 
which are immobilized by a locking device according to 

any one of Claims 1 to 5.
