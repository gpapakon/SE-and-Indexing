<ABSTRACT>
Apparatuses for heat-sealing thermoplastic materials include one or 
more cooperating sealing jaws which display mutually facing work surfaces 

with means for heating the thermoplastic material. When heating means in 
the form of a wire or a strip of electrically heatable resistor material are 

employed, extreme demands are placed on the anchorage of this to the 
sealing jaw, since elongation changes (linear expansion and contraction) 

and mechanical action risk bringing the strip out of its intended position 
while the sealing jaw is in operation. 
An apparatus for heat-sealing thermoplastic materials which obviates 
these drawbacks includes a sealing jaw with grooves in which a thermal 

strip is mechanically anchored in that the flange portions of the jaw 
projecting on either side of the groove are compressed towards one 

another and the interjacent thermal strip. The sealing jaw is manufactured 
from aluminium which has been surface anodized to create an electrically 

insulating layer between the body of the jaw and the thermal strip.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for heat-sealing of 
thermoplastic material, including a sealing jaw with a jaw body and thermal 
strip, whereby the jaw body is of one piece manufacture and displays two 
flange portions located on either side of a groove in which the thermal strip 
is mechanically anchored, an electrically insulating layer being located 
between the jaw body and the groove. Packaging containers for, for example beverages and the like are 
often manufactured from a web or sheet-shaped packaging material which 
includes at least one surface of a thermoplastic, i.e. heat-sealable or fusible 
material. The thermoplastic material makes it possible to seal the packaging 
material to itself or to other parts of the package, and imparts to the 
packaging material good liquid tightness. In the production of packaging 
containers from sheet or web-shaped packaging material, the material is 
often fused or sealed to itself with the aid of sealing jaws which heat and 
compress the material parts to one another so that the thermoplastic layers 
fuse together and form a liquid tight seal. Of course, the design and 
appearance of the sealing jaws is adapted to that type of material which is 
to be sealed, but a feature common to all prior art sealing jaws is that they 
display some form of thermal emission or thermal generation device. Thus, 
sealing jaws may, for example at their work surface, display a wire or a strip 
of electric resistor material which, when it is connected to a current source, 
is heated to a temperature which makes it possible to heat-seal 
thermoplastic material. If the packaging material which is to be sealed 
displays, in addition to a thermoplastic layer, a layer of metal such as 
aluminium foil, the heating can take place by means of induction heating, in 
which event a coil disposed in the sealing jaw induces a current in the 
aluminum foil so that this is heated and in turn conducts heat to the 
thermoplastic so that this can be sealed. A further possibility is to cater for 
the desired temperature elevation in the thermoplastic layer by utilising 
ultrasonic sound, in which event the wave movement creates frictional heat 
which makes possible heat-sealing of the thermoplastic. The above-mentioned methods all suffer from certain drawbacks. 
Induction heat (IH) for example functions only when the packaging material  
 
includes a layer of metallic material or when a layer of metal is otherwise 
provided within that region which is to be sealed. Ultrasonic
