<ABSTRACT>
A stabilized photographic dispersion is prepared by adding a hydrophobic, photographically inert compound which has a logP(calc) greater than about 9 and does not solidify or gel the dispersed phase to a photographic dispersion comprising an aqueous medium and a dispersed liquid organic phase comprising a photographically useful compound which is (i) soluble in organic solvents, (ii) substantially insoluble in water, and (iii) subject to particle growth of at least 10 % of its initial particle size when maintained in said dispersion in the absence of the added photographically inert compound.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of
stabilizing a photographic dispersion useful in
photographic elements prepared
therefrom.In the manufacture of photographic dispersions,
photographically useful compounds are dispersed in an
aqueous medium containing a hydrophilic colloid, such as
gelatin. The photographically useful compound may be a
liquid which may be dispersed directly into the aqueous
medium or it may be a solid or liquid predissolved in an
organic solvent. Typically, the photographically useful
compound is dissolved in a permanent organic solvent,
optionally with the use of an auxiliary solvent which
assists dissolution of the photographically useful
compound in the permanent solvent. The photographically
useful compound or solution thereof is mixed under high
shear or turbulence together with the aqueous medium,
which may also contain a surfactant, in order to break
the organic phase into submicron particles dispersed in a
continuous aqueous phase. The auxiliary solvent, if
present, is then removed by evaporation, washing or
dialysis. The resulting dispersion comprises an aqueous
medium containing a dispersed liquid organic phase
comprising particles containing the photographically
useful compound.The resulting dispersion can be coated onto a
support or incorporated into a silver halide emulsion or
other photographic composition which is then coated onto
a support. Generally a photographic element comprises a 
plurality of layers, at least one of which comprises a
silver halide emulsion, coated onto a support. During,
or just prior to, the coating step the dispersion may be
heated to about 45°C and maintained at that temperature
for up to 24 hours. It has been noted that in certain
instances the dispersed particles containing the
photographically useful compound can undesirably grow in
the dispersion. This particle growth can cause the
photographically useful material to become less effective
for its intended purpose. For example, a dispersion
containing relatively large particles of an ultra violet
(UV) absorber may absorb less UV radiation (i.e., have a
lower covering power) than a comparable smaller particle
UV absorber dispersion. Similarly, dispersions
containing an oxidized developer scavenger of undesirable
large particle size may result in the dispersion
scattering more light which may lead to granularity
increases, sharpness losses, and/or density losses in the
coated photographic element. In addition, if the
particle growth is severe enough for extremely large
particles (greater
