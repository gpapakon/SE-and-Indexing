belt is disposed radially outwardly of said carcass, and 
wherein a belt reinforcing layer comprising organic 

fiber cords is provided radially outwardly of said belt, 
said pneumatic tire being characterized in that said organic 

fiber cords constituting said belt reinforcing layer 
are of folding-twist construction and have a twisting 

multiplier N
t
 set between 0.06 and 0.30 to thereby improve 
its high speed durability, said twist coefficient 

being defined by the expression

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to pneumatic radial
tires for use in passenger cars or trucks and buses, and
more particularly aims to improve high-speed durability
by improving a belt reinforcing layer.In this type of pneumatic radial tire, it is
common that at least two belt layers each being a
composite of steel cords arranged at a given inclination
angle with respect to an equatorial direction of the
tire and coated with rubber are superimposed on a
carcass to form a structure providing steering
performance, wear resistance and the like in accordance
with vehicle performance requirements.Recently, the running speed of vehicles
has become faster with development
of expressway networks as well as higher output and
performances of the vehicles, and it is strongly demanded
to improve the high-speed durability of tires.For this end, there have been proposed various attempts
for improving the high-speed durability of tires. 
That is, the pushing-out of the tread or shoulder in the
tire through centrifugal force acting to the tread
portion of the tire during high-speed running, and standing
waves are serious factors affecting tires. In
order to suppress such problems, it is known to add a
belt reinforcing layer such as a so-called cap, layer or
the like to the outside of the belt layer in the radial
direction of the tire.However, it is difficult to completely compensate
a lack of rigidity by the simple addition of the
belt reinforcing layer, and consequently the expansion
of the tire in the radial direction during high-speed
running can not be sufficiently suppressed. For
this end, it has been attempted to improve the rigidity by
increasing the number of the belt reinforcing layers.
However, the increase of the belt reinforcing layer
number increases the rubber thickness to cause heat
build-up and to increase the tire weight, so that
satisfactory high-speed durability can not be obtained.Furthermore, when using plural belt reinforcing
layers, the dimensional stability of the tire
during heat build-up is degraded and also the heat
build-up becomes large, so that there is caused a
problem of reduced steering stability during
running for a long time.On the other hand, it has been attempted to improve 
the rigidity by increasing an end count of cords
embedded in rubber for the belt reinforcing layer.
However, as the end count increases, the number of cords
occupied per unit width in the radial section of the
tire or a cord occupying ratio becomes large and a ratio
or occupied rubber becomes relatively small, so that
