<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a filter jug of the type which includes a water filter medium. The invention aims to provide such a jug which is efficient in use and from which the filter medium can be disposed in an environmentally acceptable way. Accordingly, the invention provides a filter jug to contain water or other liquid, the jug comprising a first compartment (8) to receive liquid from a supply, a second compartment (1) to hold filtered liquid to be poured from an outlet (7) from the second compartment (1) and a filter chamber (13) through which liquid must pass from the first compartment (8) to the second compartment (1), the filter chamber (13) containing a filter medium and the filter medium being present in a flexible bag (B) having a liquid-pervious wall.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a filter jug of the type which includes a water filter medium 
and to a container for the filter medium to be used in the jug. Such jugs are filled 
with water, e.g. from a domestic tap and the water is passed through via the filter 
medium so as to improve the quality of the water for drinking. The filter medium is 
typically housed in a moulded canister having perforations for the passage of water 
therethrough, the canister being received in a suitably shaped chamber. The filter 
medium needs to be replaced periodiocally and the used filter in its canister must be 
discarded. GB-A-606923 discloses a portable filter unit comprising a container of pervious 
fabric having an upper compartment for the impure water and a lower compartment 
for the filtered water, the compartments being separated by a filter through which 
the water flows. GB-A-654012 discloses a filtering device comprising a reservoir for 
filtered liquid, an inner perforated cage within the reservoir and a removable 
container of granulated filter medium inside the cage. GB-A-712035 discloses a 
filtering device in the form of a beaker having a permeable base and a packing of 
active carbon between two perforated surfaces located near the base. GB-A-2192808 
discloses a filter to remove impurities from water to transport live fish. The 
filter comprises a column with an inlet near the base and an outlet near the top, the 
column containing arcuate apertured channels containing sausage-like filter bags 
containing particulate filtration medium. US-A-4094779 discloses a filtration system 
utilising an inverted upper chamber mounted on a stand above a lower chamber, a 
filter containing active carbon being disposed between the two filters. US-A-4605499  
 
discloses a filter unit comprising a pouch containing filter medium and 
means to suspend the pouch in the mouth of the container to receive water. EP-A-0349315 discloses a filter cartridge for a liquid purifier, comprising a cup like 
container having a depending baffle. In use liquid passing through the cover flows 
downwardly inside the baffle, passing through liquid treatment medium with which 
the cartridge is filled, and then upwardly between the outside of the baffle and the 
container wall. EP-A-0285908 discloses a container to purify water having a 
receiving chamber containing a filter cartridge filled with purifying agent, the 
cartridge having a foil closure that is pierced by a projection in the chamber. There remains a need for an efficient filter

<CLAIMS>
A filter jug to contain water or other liquid, the jug comprising a first 
compartment (8) to receive liquid from a supply, a second compartment (1) 

to hold filtered liquid to be poured from an outlet (7) of the second 
compartment (1) and a filter chamber (13) through which liquid must pass 

from the first compartment (8) to the second compartment (1), the filter 
chamber (13) having a removable lid (17, 33) with a projection extending 

into the chamber (13) and the chamber containing a filter medium, 

characterised in that
 the filter medium is present in a flexible bag (B) having 
a liquid-pervious wall and that the projection (39) of the removable lid (17,33) 

of the filter chamber (13) is shaped and dimensioned to extend into the 
chamber to urge the flexible bag (B) against the walls of the chamber so as 

to eliminate air gaps through which water could bypass the filter medium in 
bag (B). 
A jug according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the first compartment (8) is 
a removable inner housing dimensioned for reception in the upper part of the 

second compartment (1). 
A jug according to Claim 2, 
characterised in that
 the first compartment (8) is 
of substantially the same shape as the second compartment (1) and the 

upper periphery of the first compartment (8) engages the upper periphery of 
the second compartment (1). 
A jug according to any preceding Claim, 
characterised in that
 the flexible 
bag (B) has a wall formed of textile or synthetic material.  

 
A jug according to any preceding Claim, 
characterised in that
 the lid (17,33) 
of the chamber (13) includes a hole (37) for the escape of entrapped air. 
A jug according to any preceding Claim, 
characterised in that
 the filter 
chamber (13) includes a perforated wall portion (36) for the ingress of water 

to be littered and another (31,34) for the egress of filtered water. 
A jug according to any preceding Claim, 
characterised in that
 the filter 
chamber (13) depends from the underside of the first compartment (8). 
A jug according to any preceding Claim, 
characterised in that
 the outlet (7) 
communicates with a passageway defined by a clearance between the first 

compartment (8) and the facing wall of the second compartment (1). 
A jug according to any one preceding Claim, 
characterised in that
 the filter 
medium is adapted to remove solids or gases from the liquid to be treated. 
A jug according to any receding Claim, 
characterised in that
 means 
(24,26,26A) are present to record the date when the filter bag was installed. 
A jug according to Claim 10, 
characterised in that
 means (24,26,26A) are

A jug according to Claim 10 or 11, 
characterised in that
 the record means 
(24,26,26A) are mounted on a lid (21,33) for the jug. 
A jug according to any preceding Claim, 
characterised in that
 the flexible 
bag (B) is formed from a single blank of liquid pervious material and of 

substantially rectangular form which has been folded along the transverse  
 

centre axis and sealed along its margins and at its overlapping edges 
whereby only a single transverse seal is formed so that the flexible bag may 

be compacted in a filter chamber without overlapping wall portions of the bag 
which would restrict access to the contained filter medium.
