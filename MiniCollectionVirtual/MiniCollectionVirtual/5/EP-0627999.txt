<ABSTRACT>
A vehicle steering lock is an anti-backlash chamfered clutch lock of two revolving members (19 and 20), with anti-backlash removable chamfered wedges with integral locks, (Fig. 24, 25, 26 and 27), the wedge being locked into place between the two revolving members (19 and 20) under pressure. The apparatus is situated immediately below a steering mechanism or wheel (10). The lock either allows the steering wheel or helm (10) to be positively connected to a steering column (15) or disconnects the steering wheel (10) allowing it to rotate freely thereby neutralising the steering system.

<DESCRIPTION>
 VEHICLE STEERING LOCKThis invention relates to the function of locking and unlocking vehicle steering wheels, helms and handle bars in complete safety. The apparatus is also suitable for the locking of industrial stop-cocks and switches which operate in a similar action.The theft of vehicles and misuse of industrial equipment are a world-wide everyday problem. Modern systems of locking are inadequate; vehicles fitted with present locks can be stolen within minutes. Too much reliance has been placed on electronic or electrical systems which can be easily defeated by bypassing the circuitry.According to the present mechanical invention the apparatus provides a clutch-lock with easy and quick access and simplicity of operation to neutralise the steering mechanism and render it either operative, or inoperative, as may be required, with no comprise to safety or tactility.A specific embodiment of the invention for steering wheels, (all actions also apply to helms and industrial use), will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings in which :-Figure 1 shows in perspective, the device in position between a steering wheel (10) and the steering column (15). A steering wheel plate (11), as used to attach steering wheels (10) and steering hubs (Fig. 13), is also shown together with the upper rotating or oscillating housing (12), the clamp (13) the lower captive housing and plate (14) which is similar to the steering wheel plate (11) (See Fig. 13) The height of the entire device can be as low as 3 cm. or less, and the circumference varied, both dependant upon the materials used. The dimensions are therefore optional, dictated by the strength required for any given component in the device and to fit any particular type of vehicle or equipment In these illustrations, nuts and bolts are used to connect the different component parts. This is for easy dismantling. In a wedgelock proper, parts 14, 20, and 13 can be welded to form a sealed inaccessible unit except through the catchment (18). The bolting of the wedgelock sealed unit to the steering column is executed through the catchment (18).SUBSTITUTE SHEET

 CLAIMS.
1. A vehicle steering lock has two revolving movements or members (19 and 20) incorporating anti-backlash features. The lower revolving movement (20) is directly connected to the steering column (15), via a boss or housing (Fig. 13 No.14) and only revolves when positive steering is actuated. The upper revolving movement (19), is directly connected to the steering mechanism or steering wheel (10), by a plate (11), which is connected only to the upper revolving movement (19). Both revolving movements (19 and 20) are independent of each other. They are held, face to face, by a clamp (13) which envelopes the upper revolving movement (19), but connected to the lower revolving movement (20), allowing free independent circular or partially circular movement, within the clamp, by the upper revolving movement (19). Only when a removable chamfered anti-backlash wedge and integral lock (24, 25 or 26) is inserted, and locked, under pressure, into the chamfered anti-backlash aperture or catchment (18) of the revolving movements (19 and 20) is a direct clutch connection made between the steering wheel (10) and the steering column (15), thereby steering normally. When the removable rotating wedge and integral lock (27) is inserted and locked into the said aperture or catchment (18) the said revolving movements (19 and 20) remain independent of each other allowing the steering wheel (10) to turn freely: not being directly connected to the steering column (15), by virtue of the revolving upper plate (Fig. 27 No.52) of said wedge.
2. The vehicle steering lock as claimed in Claim 1 may be actuated alternatively by a hinged steering wheel (Figs 17 
&
 18) .
3. The vehicle steering lock as claimed in Claim 1 may be actuated alternatively by a raised catchment area (Fig 10, No.18)
4. The vehicle steering lock, as claimed in Claim 1 may be clamped alternatively by tubular connection. (Fig. 15 
&
 16.)

5. The vehicle steering lock as claimed in Claim 1 may be actuated alternatively by a sliding dog or gear raised by cam action. (Fig. 19).
6. The vehicle steering lock as claimed in Claim 1 may be actuated alternatively by a slide key. (Fig. 20).
7. The vehicle steering lock as claimed in Claim 1 may be actuated alternatively by using tapered anti-backlash dowels with opposing chamfers. (Fig. 23.)
