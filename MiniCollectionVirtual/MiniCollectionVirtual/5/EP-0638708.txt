<ABSTRACT>
In the pressure oil feed conduit (7) branching from the delivery conduit (5) a magnet valve (9) controlled by an oil lever indicator (A) on reaching a max. oil level in the sump (4) releases the flow connection to the additional oil tank (8). On reaching a min. oil level or dependent upon the time, the flow connection is held up through the magnet valve (9) moving into the closed position. The pressure valve (11) in both positions of the magnet valve is switched to the throughflow position in the fill-up conduit (10) leading to the oil sump. When the engine is shut down, the pressure valve moves back into a position stopping oil flow to the sump. The pressure valve is formed as a piston slider valve (11).

Lubricating oil circuit for an internal combustion 
engine having a suction pump in the supply of lubricating 

in an oil sump for delivering lubricating oil to 
lubrication points of the internal combustion engine via 

a feed pipe, having a valve-operated refill device for 
topping up the supply of lubricating oil available in the 

oil sump from a top-up container containing a supply of 
top-up oil, having an oil pressure pipe between the oil 

sump and the top-up container and a refill device with a 
pressure valve,
characterised in that
 
in the oil pressure pipe (7) branching off from the feed 

pipe (5), a solenoid valve, which is activated by an oil 
level indicator (A) when the oil in the oil sump (4) 

reaches a maximum level, is provided in order to open up 
the flow passageway to the container (8) of top-up oil 

and that, when the oil reaches a minimum level or as a 
function of time, the flow passageway can be opened by 

the solenoid valve (9) which can be lifted from the 
closed position, and that in both positions of the 

solenoid valve (9) the pressure valve switches over to 
the position of through-flow in the refill pipe (10) 

leading to the oil sump (4) and can be returned to a 
position in which oil is prevented from flowing to the 

oil sump when the engine is idle. 
Lubricating oil circuit as claimed in claim 1,
characterised in that
,
 
a control pipe (14) co-operating with the pressure valve 

(11) in the refill pipe (10) branches off from the oil 
pressure pipe (7) upstream of the solenoid valve, which 

is a 2/2-way valve, and that the refill pipe (10) opens 
into a narrowed cross-section on the suction side of the  

 
suction pump (3). 
Lubricating oil circuit as claimed in claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that
 
the pressure valve is a piston valve (11) which, when the 

2/2-way valve (9) is closed, operates the refill pipe 
(10) that has just been interrupted by means of the oil 

pressure. 
Lubricating oil circuit for an internal combustion 
engine having a suction pump in the supply of lubricating 

oil in an oil sump for delivering lubricating oil to 
lubrication points of the internal combustion engine via 

a feed pipe, having a valve-operated refill device for 
topping up the supply of lubricating oil available in the 

oil sump from a top-up container containing a supply of 
top-up oil, having an oil pressure pipe between the oil 

sump and the top-up container and a refill device with a 
pressure valve,
characterised in that
,
 
in the oil pressure pipe (7) branching off from the feed 

pipe (5), a time-controlled solenoid valve (20) is 
provided, which co-operates on the one hand with a 

solenoid valve (21) operated on the basis of the oil 
level in order to control the path of the flow passageway 

to the top-up container (8) or directly to the refill 
pipe (10) and on the other hand with a pressure-operated, 

spring-biassed distributor piston (22), by means of which 
additional oil drawn via a check valve (23) from the 

container (8) of top-up oil can be fed through the refill 
pipe (10) to the oil sump (4). 
Lubricating oil circuit as claimed in claim 4,
characterised in that
,
 
the two solenoid valves are 3/2-way valves (20, 21) and,  

 
when the first 3/2-way valve (20) has been placed in the 

working position by means of the longitudinally 
displaceable distributor piston (22) inside a cylinder 

(25), oil that has been displaced can be fed into the oil 
sump (4) but when the 3/2-way valve (20) is in the rest 

position and the piston pressure released, engine oil can 
be delivered via the second 3/2-way valve (21) either 

through an auxiliary refill pipe (28) into the oil sump 
(4) or through an oil change pipe (27) into the container 

(8) of top-oil. 
Lubricating oil circuit as claimed in claims 4 and 

5,
characterised in that
,
 
the pressure valve arranged in the refill pipe (10) is a 

check valve (29). 
Lubricating oil circuit for an internal combustion 
engine having a suction pump in the supply of lubricating 

oil in an oil sump for delivering lubricating oil to

in the oil pressure pipe (7) branching off from the feed 

pipe (5) a solenoid valve, which is activated by an oil 
level indicator (A) when the oil falls below a given 

level in the oil sump (4), is provided as well as a 
hydro-motor (30) lying downstream thereof, which drives 

an oil pump (32) arranged in the refill pipe (10) when 
the solenoid valve is placed in the operating position, 

whereby the delivery capacity of the oil pump (32) is  
 

greater than the flow volume through the hydro-motor 
(30). 
Lubricating oil circuit as claimed in claim 7,
characterised in that
 
the pressure valve in the top-up pipe (10) downstream of 

the oil pump (32) is a check valve (29) and the solenoid 
valve in the oil pressure pipe (7) is a 2/2-way valve.
