<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device with on the one side a 
recipient (24) with a number of receiving rooms, each of 

which can contain an item, and a closing member (10) with 
an opening (11), which member is fixedly attached to a 

detector for determining the presence or absence of an item 
in a receiving room and, when present, unlocks a bolt (16, 

17), so that recipient and closing members can only move 
with respect to each other when the item is present in the 

receiving room concerned.

<DESCRIPTION>
In relatively many cases one out of a number of items is 
used in succession. This occurs for example in the case of 
drills for a drilling machine, files and chisels when 
making stringed instruments, cutters, reamers etcetera. Such items are often accommodated in a device with a 
recipient containing the same number of receiving rooms for 
each item, and closing members to close or open each of the 
receiving rooms, at least part of the closing members being 
movable with respect to the recipient. Here it is the 
user's duty to replace an employed item in its original 
place, but practice shows that this does not always happen, 
at least occasionally not. This means that the item 
concerned later has to be searched for or may get lost, for 
example thrown away together with shavings or other waste 
matter. Searching for an item, for the loss of which one can hold 
oneself responsible, is an unpleasant occupation, often 
causing resentment and, therefore, being extremely tiring 
as well. As a result the loss of items, even if only 
temporarily, not only causes a direct loss of time, but it 
also affects the work atmosphere and probably the 
productivity as well. In addition, the items often represent a value not to be 
disregarded. The invention aims at making an improvement in this respect 
by constructing said device in such way that another item 
can only be withdrawn when the one used first has been 
replaced in its proper place. In order to retrieve the next 
item one has to go to the item holder anyway and when, in 
doing so, the item previously employed is carried along 
straight away, virtually no loss of time occurs.  In order to attain the aforementioned aims, the invention 
provides for the arrangements indicated in the 
characterizing section of claim 1. A simple embodiment is constituted in that, together with 
the detector, the closing member is movable with respect to 
the receiving rooms and has an opening on the location of 
the detector for admitting an item. Now the simple 
situation occurs that, when the opening is in the position 
in which the employed item can be replaced, free movement 
of the closing member containing the opening is possible 
immediately upon replacing said item. In order to prevent items from being brought into a 
receiving room in which an item of another type, for 
instance of a different size, belongs, it is preferably 
provided that the receiving rooms have size controls that 
prevent an item of a different size from being accommodated 
in a receiving room
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
1.Device for withdrawing a number of items with a 
recipient (24) containing the same number of receiving 

rooms for each item, and closing members (9,10,37) to close 
or open each of the receiving rooms, at least part of the 

closing members being movable with respect to the 
recipient, characterized in that the part of the closing 

members (10, 9, 12, 13, 14) that is movable with respect to 
the recipient (24), contains a detector 14, which with 

respect to the recipient can take said number of positions, 
in each of which it cooperates with one of the receiving 

rooms, and transmits a signal consistent with the absence 
or presence of an item (28), a locking device (17, 29) 

being present to prevent the movement of the detector with 
respect to the recipient (24) at the signal indicating the 

absence of an item, and that the closing members are open 
or can be opened in front of the receiving room with which 

the detector cooperates. 
2. Device as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that, 
together with the detector, the closing member is movable 

with respect to the receiving rooms and has an opening on 
the location of the detector for admitting an item. 
3. Device as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized in that 
the receiving rooms have size controls (25, 27) that 

prevent an item of a different size from being accommodated 
in a receiving room intended for a specific item (28). 
4. Device as claimed in claim 3 for items with different 
cross-sections, characterized in that the size controls 

accommodate an admission opening of a first size (26) 
and/or an admission opening (27) of a smaller size. 
5. Device as claimed in claims 1 - 4, characterized in that 
the detector is a metal detector. 
6. Device as claimed in claims 1 - 4, characterized in that
 

the detector is a light detector. 
7. Device as claimed in claims 1 - 4, characterized in that 
the detector comprises a contact to be operated by an item. 
8. Device as claimed in any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the recipient and the closing members 

are flat and can slide along each other. 
9. Device as claimed in claim 8, characterized in that the 
closing members have a size in the slide direction, which 

amounts to approximately twice the size of the recipient 
between the first and the last receiving room. 
10. Device as claimed in any of the claims 1 - 7, 
characterized in that the recipient (24) and the closing 

portion (10) are mainly cylindrical. 
11. Device as claimed in claim 10, characterized in that 
it has a base or a fastening part (1), onto which a 

cylindrical closing member (10) provided with an opening is 
secured and a recipient (24) coaxial in relation to said 

closing member, the detector having been mounted at the 
location in the direction of rotation of the opening in 

fixed position with respect to the fastening part or the 
closing member. 
12. Device as claimed in claim 11, characterized in that 
the base or the fastening part carries a central column 

cooperating with a lock in order to be able to respectively 
secure and remove the recipient in axial direction. 
13. Device as claimed in any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that an information scale indicating data 

of each item allocated to a receiving room, is fixedly 
attached to the recipient. 
14. Device as claimed in any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the recipient constitutes a cassette. 
15. Device as claimed in any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that localization means (25, 27) determine 

the place of the items of different thickness in such 
manner that for items (28) with a smaller thickness the 

distance to the detector (14) is at most equal to that of 
an item having the greatest thickness.
