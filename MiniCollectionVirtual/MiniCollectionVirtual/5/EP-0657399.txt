<ABSTRACT>
A high-pressure discharge lamp (1) is provided with a 
ceramic vessel (6) made from alumina which is doped 

with 100-800 ppm MgO, 200-1200 ppm ZrO₂ and 10-300 
ppm Y₂O₃. This improves the loading capacity of the 

ceramic.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to sintered bodies suitable for 
the manufacture of discharge vessels and to methods for 
making the sintered bodies. The invention further 
relates to high-pressure discharge lamps having such a 
ceramic discharge vessel, more particularly high-pressure 
sodium lamps, and also metal halide lamps. The German Patent Application 32 01 750 discloses a 
method for making a light-transmissive sintered body 
from alumina, to which magnesium oxide in a quantity of 
from 0.02 % to 0.5 % by weight has been added as a 
sintering aid for control of the grain growth. High 
mechanical strength and high transparency are obtained 
by additionally adding from 0.005 % to 0.1 % by weight 
of zirconium oxide or hafnium oxide or cerium oxide. The German Patent Application 20 42 379 discloses a 
light-transmissive alumina sintered body for discharge 
vessels of high-pressure discharge lamps and a method 
for making the sintered body. It is doped with from 
0.01 % - 0.1 % by weight of MgO, 0.05 % - 0.5 % by 
weight of Y2O3 and 0.05 % - 0.5 % by weight of  
 
La2O3. Satisfactory transparency and high mechanical strength 
are desired because the sintered body is exposed to 
alternating thermal loads in operation of the high-pressure 
discharge lamp. The German Patent Application 31 08 677 discloses a sintered 
body and a method for making it. The sintered body comprises 
substantially alumina doped with from 0.03 % - 0.15 % by 
weight of MgO and with from 0.002 % - 0.07 % by weight of ZrO2 
and/or 0.003 % - 0.12 % by weight of HfO2. MgO does not only 
serve to control the grain growth but also provides for a high 
degree of translucency and eliminates the residual porosity of 
the ceramic. The other two oxides prevent precipitation of the 
spinel phase (a mixed crystal of Al2O3 and MgO) and, in 
addition, regulate the grain growth. These sintered bodies are particularly advantageously used 
with high-pressure sodium discharge lamps (see the European 
Patent Applications 110 248 and 110 249). Reference is expressly made to the contents of the above 
publications. US Patent 4 797 238 describes a translucent polycrystalline 
alumina ceramic doped with a sintering aid. MgO alone or in 
combination with a second material selected from Y2O3, La2O3, 
ZrO2, HfO2 and Yb2O3 is used as a sintering aid.  
 It is an object of the invention to improve the loading 
capacity of ceramic sintered bodies for high-pressure 
discharge lamps and the loading capacity of the lamps 
themselves. Loading is to be understood to mean
