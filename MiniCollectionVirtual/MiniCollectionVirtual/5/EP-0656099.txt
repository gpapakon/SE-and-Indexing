<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for monitoring the operative position of the rotary system of a vacuum pump, especially a turbo-molecular pump, which is suspended in the housing (1) of the vacuum pump by means of a magnetic bearing (14, 15); the process is implemented in that, downstream of the magnetic suspension of the rotary system, the rotor (6) and the housing (1) are coupled in a circuit (42) in which, besides a current source (43), there is a current conduction indicator (44); the result of the test is established with the aid of the current conduction indicator; the check on the operative position of the rotary system is preferably followed by the adjustment of an emergency running device (33, 34, 36) with the aid of the circuit (42).

Process for checking the operating position of the 
rotating system of a vacuum pump, preferably a turbo-molecular 

pump, said system being suspended within the 
casing (1) of the vacuum pump by means of a magnetic 

bearing (14, 15), 
characterised
 in that the checking 
operation is effected following suspension of the rotating 

system in the magnetic bearings and prior to rotation of 
said system, in that, with a view to effecting said 

checking operation, the rotor (6) and the casing (1) are 
connected to a current circuit (42) comprising in addition 

to a current source (43) a current-flow indicator (44), in 
that the result of the checking operation is determined 

with the aid of the current-flow indicator (44) and in that 
the operation of checking the operating position of the 

rotating system is followed by adjusting, with the aid of 
the current circuit (42), a bearing assembly (33, 34, 36) 

for emergency operation. 
Process according to Claim 1, 
characterised
 in that in 
a bearing assembly for emergency operation arranged near 

the front end of the rotating system, whereby said 
bearing assembly comprises the bearing (33) for emergency 

operation, a component (34) which is firmly secured to the 
casing and a rotating component (36), the concentricity of 

the gap (38) between the component which is firmly secured 
to the casing and the rotating component is adjusted by 

displacing the component (34) which is firmly secured to 
the casing. 
Process according to Claim 2, 
characterised
 in that 
the adjustment of the bearing assembly (33, 34, 36) for 

emergency operation is effected with the aid of boreholes 
(49, 52) in the component (34) which is firmly secured to 

the casing and in the rotating component (36) as well as 
with the aid of an adjusting pin (53).  

 
A vacuum pump suitable for carrying out the process 
according to one of the preceding claims, preferably a 

turbo-molecular vacuum pump with a rotating system 
suspended in the casing (1) of the vacuum pump with the aid 

of a magnetic bearing (14, 15), 
characterised
 in that means 
are provided for producing a current circuit (42) having a 

current source (43) and a current-flow indicator (44), to 
which the rotor (6) and the casing (1) can be connected in 

tandem in such a manner as to ensure that the gaps between 
the rotating system and the casing form part of said 

current circuit (42), in that, with a view to effecting the 
adjustment, a bearing assembly (33, 34, 36) for emergency 

operation is provided, said bearing assembly being arranged 
at the front end in the region of the rotor and comprising 

a flange component (34) which is firmly secured to the 
casing and a rotating pot-type component (36) whereby the 

bearing (33) is arranged between said components, in that 
the flange component (34) and the pot-type component (36) 

comprise central boreholes (49, 52) which, with a view to 
adjusting the bearing assemblies for emergency operation to 

the required position of the rotating system, must 
be aligned in respect of one another, and in that an 

adjusting pin (53) is provided which can be introduced by 
way of a sliding fit into the borehole (49) of the flange 

component (34). 
Pump according to Claim 4, 
characterised
 in that the 
flange component (34) comprises a socket which protrudes 

into the pot-type component (36). 
Pump according to Claim 5, 
characterised
 in that the 
bearing (33) is secured to the socket of the flange 

component (34) - for instance with the aid of a bolt (45). 
Pump according to Claim 5, 
characterised
 in that the 
bearing (33) is secured to the pot-type component (36) and 

comprises the socket of the flange component (34).  
 
Pump according to one of Claims 4 to 7, 
characterised
 
in that the diameter of the borehole (52) in the pot-type 

component (36) is approximately 10 to 20 percent larger 
than the diameter of the borehole (49) in the flange 

component (34).
