<ABSTRACT>
The tandem blades (50, 51) of a razor can be protected when not in use for shaving, without disturbing a pre-set shaving geometry and with reduced risk of damage to the blades (50, 51) and the fingers of a user during manipulation, by providing a shaving cartridge (11) which is movable, relative to a handle (10) of the razor, for retraction behind a shield (23) formed in the handle. Also disclosed are means to provide, in such a razor, replaceable cartridges (11) for a permanent handle (10) which includes a cartridge carrier (61).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a razor according to the preambles of claims 1 and 14.Such a razor is described in
GB-A-1565415. The razor has a shaving unit
mounted on a handle for pivotal movement about an
axis extending parallel with the blade edge. The
handle is bifurcated to provide wings which are
resilient enough to provide for assembly of the
shaving unit between the wings of the handle by
elastic deformation of the wings and retention of
the head over its range of movement.A disadvantage of the construction,
shown in GB-A-1565415, is the need for a finger or
thumb of the user to manipulate the shaving unit,
close to the actual blade edges, with the
consequent danger of physical damage to the blade
edges, or the user's hand.GB-A-2100650 describes a razor having a
guard and blade members in a fixed position on a
handle of the razor and includes a cap surface,
which is movable between a position in which the 
blade(s) are exposed for shaving and one in which the or each blade is shielded. In
yet another previous proposal the cap surface is fixed but the guard-platform and
blade pivot on an axis in the area of the guard surface, to carry the blade edge
between a shaving position and a shielded position.GB-A-2113594 and GB-A-2107236 each disclose a razor having a
fixed guard bar and top cap, and a blade platform which can move between a
shaving position and a retracted position. GB-A-2118088 describes a razor having a
fixed blade and top cap, but a pivotable guard bar, movable between a position in
which the blade is exposed for shaving and a position in which the blade is
protected.A problem with all such proposals is the element of doubt and
unpredictability which they introduce into the shaving geometry (that is, the relative
positions of the blades, cap surface and guard surface in the shaving disposition).
Even very small changes in shaving geometry can have a pronounced effect on
shaving performance, and are therefore undesirable.The present invention is a razor which provides for blade protection
during periods of non-use, without detriment to the shaving geometry, and with a
reduced likelihood of damage to the blades or the bands of a user during
manipulation of the razor.According to the present invention there is provided a razor including
a handle, a razor blade assembly having a cap and a guard with at least one blade
interposed between them and a shielding member on said handle for shielding said
at least one blade, said razor blade assembly being movable relative to the handle
between a

<CLAIMS>
A razor including a handle (10), a razor blade assembly (11) having a
cap (20) and a guard (22) with at least one blade (50,51) interposed between them and

a shielding member (23,33) on said handle for shielding said at least one blade (50,51),
said razor blade assembly being movable relative to the handle between a shaving

position and a non-shaving position in which the cutting edge of said at least one blade
(50,51) is protected, said razor blade assembly (11) being movable into said non-shaving

position behind said shielding member (23) without changing the shaving
geometry defined by relative positions between said cap (20), guard (22) and at least

one blade (50,51), characterized in that said razor blade assembly is in the form of a
retractable shaving unit, and in that an actuator is provided on the handle (10) and

coupled to the shaving unit for retracting the shaving unit either out and from behind
said shielding member to said shaving position or into and behind said shielding

member to said non-shaving position.
A razor according to claim 1, characterized in that the actuator includes a
link 
(14) between the shaving unit (11) and the handle (10).
A razor according to claim 2, characterized in that the link (14) is
flexible.
A razor according to claim 2, characterized in that the link (14) is
connected to the handle (10) by a pin (15) and slot (16) connection.
A razor according to claim 4, characterized in that the pin (15) is on the
link (14) and provides an operating button.
A razor according to claim 1, characterized in that the shaving unit
(11,61) comprises a cartridge carrier (61) and a replaceable cartridge (11) carried by the

carrier (61).
A razor according to claim 6, characterized in that the cartridge carrier
(61) and the replaceable cartridge (11) each have at least one co-operating latching

surface (67) for retaining the cartridge (11) in the carrier (61).
A razor according to claim 7, characterized in that the carrier latch
surface (67) is a shoulder on a resilient spring finger (66) and the cartridge latch 

surface is a lug.
A razor according to claim 7, characterized in that said razor includes
means to inhibit co-operation of the latching surfaces if the handle is offered up to the

cartridge in the opposite orientation from the useful orientation.
A razor according to claim 1, characterized in that the shaving unit (11)
in a shaving deposition is carried on the handle (10) for swiveling movement between

the starting shaving position and deflected shaving positions.
A razor according to claim 10, characterized in that the shaving unit (11)
has camming surfaces (49), and the handle has leaf springs (471,472) which act against

the camming surfaces (49) to urge the shaving unit (11) into the starting shaving
position.
A razor according to claim 10, characterized in that the shaving unit (11)
is held by claw surfaces (42) captive in the handle (10) for rotation on the handle (10)

between the retracted position, the starting shaving position and the range of deflected
shaving positions.
A razor according to claim 1, characterized in that the shaving unit
(11,61) is retained to the handle (10) by a pair of pin (12) and slot (13) connections

which also define the locus of movement of the shaving unit between the shaving and
retracted positions.
A razor including a handle (10), a razor blade assembly having a cap
(20) and a guard (22) with said at least one blade (50,51) interposed between them,

said razor blade assembly being movable relative to the handle between a shaving
position and a non-shaving position in which the cutting edge of said at least one blade

(50,51) is protected, and a shielding member (23) on said handle (10) for shielding said
at least one blade (50,51), said razor blade assembly being movable into said non-shaving

position behind said shielding member (23) without changing the shaving
geometry defined by relative positions between said cap (20), guard (22) and at least

one blade (50,51), characterized in that said razor blade assembly is in the form of a
retractable shaving unit, in that an actuator is provided on the handle (10) for retracting

the shaving unit, in that the shaving unit in a shaving disposition is carried on the
handle (10) for swivelling movement between a starting shaving position and deflected

shaving positions, and in that the shaving unit is held by claw surfaces (42) captive in 
the handle (10) for rotation on the handle (10) between the retracted position, a starting

shaving position and a range of deflected shaving positions.
