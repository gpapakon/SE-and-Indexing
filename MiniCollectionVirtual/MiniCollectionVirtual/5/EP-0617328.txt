<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of an apparatus and of a process by means of which a coated or uncoated web of material (1) can be cleaned simultaneously on both sides by a cleaning apparatus located on a turnstile, the web of material (1) being guided first of all with one side over a roller (2) around which it is looped and then being guided with the other side over the other, diametrically opposite roller (3'). Depending on the degree of soiling of the two looped rollers, the roller turnstile is pivoted, via a rotating apparatus, through 180@ counter to the direction of the incoming web of material (1), with the result that the hitherto unused rollers (3, 2') come into engagement with the web of material and the hitherto used rollers (2, 3') are uncoupled by means of a coupling device and can be cleaned. In each case two adjacent rollers, of which one is driven by the web of material, whereas the other is not driven, are connected to one another via a belt drive in such a manner that they can be uncoupled.
