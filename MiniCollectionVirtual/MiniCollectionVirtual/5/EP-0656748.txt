<ABSTRACT>
A bread-like product having a blood sugar reducing effect for diabetics is manufactured by baking of a dough that comprises the following ingredients: (a) soya protein, (b) a fibre component comprising at least 50% by weight of wheat bran, (c) vegetable oil, (d) a fat-containing, substantially starch-free nut and/or kernel component, (e) a preferably viscous, possibly protein enriched, low-fat sour milk product, possibly in the form of a dry powder, (f) egg white, possibly in the form of a dry powder, and (g) a leavening agent, the weight ratios of the ingredients, calculated on dry matter, being as follows: (a) to (b) from 0,3 to 3 (understood as the value of a/b being in the interval from 0,3 to 3), ((a)+(b)) to (c) from 3 to 8, ((a)+(b)) to (d) from 3 to 7, ((a)+(b)+(d)) to (e) from 8 to 12 and ((a)+(b)+(d)) to (f) from 12 to 20. The product is a bread-like product, which in isocaloric amounts can replace conventional bread whereby a long-acting blood sugar reduction is obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a bread-like product 
having a blood sugar reducing effect for diabetics, and a 
powder mix, which upon mixing with water and vegetable oil 
forms a dough, that may be baked to a bread-like product 
having blood sugar reducing effect for diabetics. It is well known among nutrition experts that the 
diet for diabetics should be adapted so that occurrence of 
high blood sugar concentrations is prevented. The most obvious way of avoiding undesirably high 
blood sugar concentrations is to reduce consumption of 
digestible carbohydrates including starch. However, with the selection of foods generally 
available it is difficult to establish a diabetic dietary, 
which ensures the blood sugar concentration being kept at 
sufficiently low levels while at the same time ensuring 
that the patient gets sufficient and appropriate nutrition 
in general and that the meals appear as normal and tasty 
meals fitting into common eating habits. To reduce consumption of starch it has been proposed 
to replace the patients' consumption of bread totally or 
partly by the consumption of various substitutes thereof. The bread replacer products so far proposed, however, 
have all shown various disadvantages such as: Too high 
protein content, which may cause renal trouble, a taste, 
consistency or physical appearance deviating from those of 
bread to such an extent that the products are not regarded 
and accepted as bread replacer, or the products have 
contained such large amounts of industrially manufactured, 
partially synthetic ancillary ingredients, which are 
normally not present in such amounts in ordinary bread, 
that the bread substitutes were not accepted as "natural" 
foods. Thus, from DE-A-24 38 597 a low carbohydrate pastry  
 
for diabetics is known, which contains less than 4% digestible 
carbohydrates, the sugar having been replaced by a 
sugar substitute such as sorbitol, and the flour having 
been replaced by a flour substitute mix that contains wheat 
gluten, soya protein and a thickening agent such as locust 
bean flour, gum arabic or a cellulose derivative such as 
methylcellulose or carboxymethylcellulose. Such pastry will 
have no similarity to bread and as appears from the 
published patent application the invention described 
therein relates to cake or biscuit-like products the roll 
of which in a diabetic diet would be very limited. From DE-B-28 47 876 it is known to manufacture a 
pastry with a particularly high protein content from wheat 
gluten, bran, milk protein,

<CLAIMS>
A bread-like product having a blood sugar reducing 
effect for diabetics, said product being characterized in 

that it is manufactured by baking of a dough comprising the 
following ingredients: 


(a) soya protein, 
(b) a fibre component comprising at least 50% by 
weight of wheat bran, 
(c) vegetable oil, 
(d) a fat-containing, substantially starch-free nut 
and/or kernel component, 
(e) a preferably viscous, possibly protein 
enriched, low-fat sour milk product, possibly in 

the form of a dry powder, 
(f) egg white, possibly in the form of a dry 
powder, and 
(g) a leavening agent, 
the weight ratios of the ingredients, calculated on dry 

matter, being as follows: 

(a) to (b) from 0,3 to 3 (understood as the value of 
a/b being in the interval from 0,3 to 3), 


((a)+(b)) to (c) from 3 to 8, 
((a)+(b)) to (d) from 3 to 7, 
((a)+(b)+(d)) to (e) from 8 to 12 and 
((a)+(b)+(d)) to (f) from 12 to 20. 
A bread-like product according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the ratios by weight of the 

ingredients defined in claim 1 are as follows: 

(a) to (b) from 0,5 to 2, 
((a)+(b)) to (c) from 2 to 7, 
((a)+(b)) to (d) from 4 to 6, 
((a)+(b)+(d)) to (e) from 9 to 11 and 
((a)+(b)+(d)) to (f) from 14 to 18. 
A bread-like product according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the ingredient (b) is wheat bran. 
A bread-like product according to claim 1, 2 or 3, 
characterized in that the ingredient (c) is olive oil
