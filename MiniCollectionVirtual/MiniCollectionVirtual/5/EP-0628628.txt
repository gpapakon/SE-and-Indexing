<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a new strain of an 
ice nucleus-forming bacterium, a process for the 
cultivation of the new strain of the ice nucleus-forming 
bacterium, an ice nucleus-forming substance containing the 
strain, and the uses of the ice nucleus-forming substance. As bacteria for promoting the formation of ice, 
Pseudomonassyringae and Erwiniaananas have hitherto been 
well known. Also, among Xanthomonascampestris bacteria, 
those known are the following three strains: the strain 
obtained from the leaves of Florida citrus [Goto Masao et 
al., Nisshokubyo-Hou, 54, 196 (1988); and Minsavage G.V. 
& Stall R.E., (1986), Proc. 6th Int. Conf. Plant Path. 
Bact., 994-1004], X.campestris pv. translucens [Kim H.K., 
Orser C., Lindow S.E. and Sands D.C., Plant Disease, 71, 
994-997 (1987)], and the strain obtained from tea buds 
(INAX) [Goto Masao et al., Nisshokubyo-Hou, 54, 189-197 
(1988)]. However, among these ice nucleus-forming bacteria, 
Pseudomonassyringae which is utilized for practical use 
is known to have phytopathogenicity, so that it may 
adversely affect the environment when it is used for 
spraying to form artificial snow. On the other hand, 
bacteria having no such phytopathogenicity generally grow 
slowly and thus may not be suitable for production on an 
industrial scale. Additionally, bacteria which are 
negative with respect to tobacco hypersensitivity reaction 
[Phytopathology, 77, 611-615 (1987)] are generally free of 
phytopathogenicity. It would therefore be extremely advantageous to the 
industry to discover a strain which is negative with  
 
respect to tobacco hypersensitivity reaction and yet can 
grow at a high rate. An object of the present invention is to provide a 
new ice nucleus-forming bacterium which has the above 
advantages. Another object of the present invention is 
to provide a process for the cultivation of the new ice 
nucleus-forming bacterium. Still another object of the 
present invention is to provide an ice nucleus-forming 
substance containing the new ice nucleus-forming bacterium 
and further to develop uses thereof in various fields. The present inventors have conducted extensive 
researches for the purpose of attaining the above stated 
objects. As a result, they have found that a bacterium 
strain obtained from tea leaves is a new strain which can 
fulfil the intended purpose, and have thus developed the 
present invention. The present invention provides a new Xanthomonascampestris 
strain, INXC-1 (FERM BP-4191). The present invention also
