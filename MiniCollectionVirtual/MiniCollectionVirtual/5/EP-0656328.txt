<ABSTRACT>
A plastic cement that is easy to mold thermoplastically, loses the thermoplasticity upon hardening caused by 
water absorption, and is excellent in various properties including heat resistance. A thermoplastic cement composition 

is prepared by compounding 100 parts by weight of a thermoplastic cement with 50-600 parts by weight of a hydraulic 
cement and/or an air-hardening cement, and 0.1-20 parts by weight of a hydrophilic substance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a thermoplastic 
cement composition having intermediate properties 
between those of cements and those of thermoplastics, 
and provides a thermoplastic cement composition which 
is usable in a wide industrial field including 
articles necessitating heat resistance. It has been known to modify a thermoplastic by 
the addition of an inorganic filler. However, it has also been known that the heat 
resistance of a thermoplastic cannot essentially be 
improved by this means. Further, although the 
thermoplasticity of a thermoplastic is a property 
indispensable to molding, it is unnecessary in many 
cases after molding. A liquid-crystal plastic 
developed for the main purpose of providing a highly 
heat-resistant resin is molded at a high temperature. 
If a plastic which can be molded at a low temperature 
and is highly resistant to heat is prepared, however, 
the value thereof will be very large. Although a thermosetting resin is known to be 
relatively excellent in heat resistance, this resin is  
 
inferior to a thermoplastic in the rate and easiness 
of molding not to rank with a thermoplastic as a 
whole, though a thermosetting resin is regarded as of 
high value by virtue of its in-situ moldability. Recently, the disposal of waste plastics has 
become an environmental issue. However, no suitable 
method for the disposal thereof has been found as yet, 
so that the development of a new effective method 
therefor has been expected. Generally, a 
thermoplastic is lowered in moldability and properties 
after the first heat cycle, which makes the recycle of 
a thermoplastic so difficult as to give a large amount 
of waste plastics. Although the conversion of waste plastics into an 
oil through thermal cracking has recently been noted 
as a technique for recycling waste plastics, this 
technique has problems that this oil is more costly 
than ordinary fuel oils, that the sorting of waste 
plastics is necessary, and that the cracking residue 
must be secondarily disposed of. Under these 
circumstances, it has been expected to develop a 
technique for recycling waste plastics which uses a 
waste plastic itself as the raw material and can be 
applied to a waste plastic contaminated with other 
plastics and/or foreign matters.  Meanwhile, precast concrete has problems that the 
molding cost is high and that the curing takes a long 
time, so that concrete is far inferior to 
thermoplastic in molding cost. It is conceivable that 
these problems will be solved, if precast concrete
