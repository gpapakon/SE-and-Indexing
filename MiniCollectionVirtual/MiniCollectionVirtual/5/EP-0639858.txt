<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in to silicon on insulator (SOI) processes and devices, and, in particular, 
SOI substrates, devices, and methods and techniques for providing uniform SOI substrates. In the fabrication of microelectronic circuits, silicon wafers have been the predominant material 
for solid-state device manufacture. However, in very large scale integrated (VLSI) devices, other materials 
are replacing silicon. Two important materials are silicon on insulator (silicon on silicon dioxide) and 
compound semiconductor material such as gallium arsenide. Such materials are chosen for their inherent 
high speed and for optimizing circuit parameters. For example, SOI devices are often used in 
communication systems because of their resistance to failure upon exposure to adverse radiation. One SOI technique is to create islands of silicon on oxidized portions of a wafer. A wafer is 
patterned to create mesas that are oxidized. Polysilicon is grown over the oxidized pattern and then the 
wafer is ground back on its opposite side to the oxide layer. Thus, the final wafer appears to be a pattern 
of semiconductor-grade silicon on silicon dioxide which is supported by polysilicon. One problem with 
this technique is that there are many variations in the thickness of the silicon islands since it is difficult 
to grind the wafer to precise layer thicknesses suitable for microelectronic circuits. Another prior art technique relies upon implanting oxygen directly into the surface of the silicon 
wafer in order to create a buried oxide layer (SIMOX). However, this technique results in unacceptable 
damage to the silicon layer which cannot be adequately cured by annealing and recrystallization. 
Moreover, the oxide layer tends to be too thin to provide reliable insulation. A third technique relies upon crystal regrowth on a substrate. Here, the silicon substrate is 
oxidized and the oxide layer is patterned to have a portion of it removed. Polysilicon is deposited into 
the oxide pockets where it is recrystallized to form polysilicon. One problem with this technique is that 
the grain boundaries of there crystallized polysilicon interfere with the electrical integrity of junctions in 
the islands. Still another technique for providing SOI wafers relies upon wafer bonding technology. In 
accordance with this technology, a device wafer or a handle wafer is oxidized to have one of its surfaces 
coated with a layer of silicon dioxide. The two wafers are then placed together and heated in a furnace 
at a sufficiently
