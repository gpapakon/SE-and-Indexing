<ABSTRACT>
A security device (10) for securing a frame or chassis of a caravan or other wheeled vehicle to the ground comprises an elongate securing arm (12) extending substantially transversely of the chassis between two frame members (4) thereof, and an elongate support member (14) extending downwardly into the ground. The support member (14) and the securing arm (12) are made in one piece and the free end of the support member (14) is engaged in the ground. The engagement of the support member (14) is such that withdrawal thereof from the ground requires rotation of the support member (14). At each of its ends, the securing arm (12) carries engagement members (32, 34) to engage with, and be locked to, the frame members (4). Although the security device is simple to manufacture and install, it provides a high degree of security.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a releasable security 
device for securing a chassis or frame to the ground. Whilst the security device can be used in any 
circumstances where it is required to secure a vehicle, 
machine or the like, the invention is particularly 
concerned with the security of caravans or other wheeled 
vehicles which are to be stood in one place for some 
considerable time. In this respect, the theft of caravans, 
power boats, horse trailers, and construction plant and 
equipment has become increasingly common. US-A-1351297 describes a releasable security device 
for securing an automobile, which security device has an 
upstanding support member embedded in a concrete base, and 
a slotted locking disc rotatably carried by the support 
member. The locking disc rotates as an automobile axle is 
engaged therein, and the disc may be locked in its rotated 
position in which it retains the automobile axle. It is an object of the invention to provide a security 
device for a chassis or frame which is simple to install, 
but gives a high degree of security. According to the present invention there is provided a 
releasable security device for securing a chassis or frame 
to the ground, said security device comprising an elongate 
securing arm rigidly connected to, and extending 
substantially at right angles to, an upstanding support 
member arranged to be secured to the ground, said securing 
arm projecting on either side of said support member such 
that said security device is generally T-shaped, and said 
security device further comprising engagement means 
provided at or near each end of said securing arm for  
 
engagement with a chassis or frame, and locking means for 
releasably locking said engagement means. It is particularly advantageous to secure the chassis 
or frame of a wheeled vehicle, such as a caravan or a boat 
trailer, to the ground, rather than securing or 
immobilising an individual part of the vehicle to be 
protected. In this respect, it will be appreciated that 
the chassis or frame is inherently strong and not easily 
movable. Securing the chassis or frame to the ground 
enables the provision of a particularly strong and secure 
device in a relatively simple manner. The support member may, if required, be permanently 
fixed within the ground. For example, the support member 
may be an upstanding metal tube or rod, embedded in 
concrete or another foundation in the ground. Presently, it is preferred that the support member is 
arranged to be removably secured to the

A releasable security device (10) for securing a 
chassis or frame (2) to the ground, said security device 

comprising a support arm (12) rigidly connected to, and 
extending substantially at right angles to, an upstanding 

support member (14) arranged to be secured to the ground, 
said securing arm (12) projecting on either side of said 

support member such that said security device is generally 
T-shaped, and said security device further comprising 

engagement means (32, 34) provided at or near each end of 
said securing arm (12) for engagement with a chassis or 

frame, and locking means (38) for releasably locking said 
engagement means. 
A security device as claimed in Claim 1, wherein said 
support member (14) is an upstanding metal tube or rod 

embedded in a foundation in the ground. 
A security device as claimed in Claim 1, wherein said 
support member (14) is releasably secured to the ground, 

and wherein it is required to rotate the support member 
during its insertion into, and during its subsequent 

withdrawal from, the ground. 
A security device as claimed in Claim 3, wherein said 
support member (14') comprises an elongate member having a 

pointed end (40) and having one or more auger flights (42) 
provided on its periphery. 
A security device as claimed in Claim 3 or 4, wherein 
a receiving means (18) for fixing in the ground is provided 

for said support member (14), and interengaging means (20, 
24) are provided on the receiving member and on said 

support member to releasably engage the support member (14) 
within said receiving member (18).  

 
A security device as claimed in Claim 5, wherein said 
receiving means comprises a tubular member (22) for fixing 

in the ground and arranged to receive at least an end 
portion of said support member, and wherein said 

interengaging means (20, 24) require rotation of the 
support member relative to the receiving member. 
A security device as claimed in Claim 5 or 6, wherein 
said support member (14) is an elongate member whose end 

portion is arranged to be received within a tubular 
receiving member (22), and said interengaging means 

comprise a pin or bar (20) extending diametrically of, and 
within, said receiving member, and at least one slot (24) 

extending in said support member and opening in the end 
thereof. 
A security device as claimed in any preceding claim, 
wherein each said engagement means (32, 34) is at the free 

end of said securing arm (12) and comprises a projecting 
portion (30) and two spaced engaging members (32) carried 

on said projecting portion for arrangement on either side 
of part of a frame or chassis. 
A security device as claimed as any preceding claim, 
wherein the two ends of said securing arm (12) are hollow 

and are each arranged to receive an end of a respective 
projecting portion (30) therein, wherein each said 

projecting portion (30) comprises an elongate extension 
tube arranged to be received within a respective open end 

of said securing arm (12), and wherein said engagement 
means (32, 34) are carried on said projecting portion. 
A security device as claimed in Claim 9, further 
comprising two spaced wheel engaging members (54) connected
