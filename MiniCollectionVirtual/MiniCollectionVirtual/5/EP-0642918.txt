A control means for a green-brick press,
 
in which one respective hydraulic piston-cylinder device (3, 7) engages on an upper 

ram (1) and on a lower ram (2) in each case, and the upper ram acts from above and 
the lower ram acts from below upon a mould filled with moulding material, and
 
in which a pre-consolidation of the moulding material is provided from below, and a 

movement of the upper ram and a movement of the lower ram by a respective pressing 
path are provided for pressing the moulding material,
 
wherein the pressing path of the upper ram is less than the pressing path of the lower 

ram, the pressing-path movements of the upper ram and the lower ram are in different 
directions, and simultaneity of the pressing-path movements of the upper ram and the 

lower ram is provided,
characterized in that
 
a continuous path measurement (13, 14, 15) is provided at the upper ram (1) and at the 

lower ram (2), and the movements of the upper ram (1) and the lower ram (2) for 
pressing are continuously controlled in their travel (17, 18) in such a way using a computer 

(16) that the different pressing paths are covered in the same time at different 
speeds. 
A control means according to Claim 1, wherein the pre-consolidation is provided by a 
movement of the lower ram over a pre-consolidation path, 
characterized in that
 the 
movement of the lower ram (2) over the pre-consolidation path is controlled in its 

travel (17, 18) by means of the continuous path measurement (13, 14, 15). 
A control means according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the lower ram (2) is 
traversed by mandrels projecting into the mould. 
A control means according to Claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein the piston-cylinder devices 
have associated therewith a pump drive which is connected to the two piston-cylinder 

devices by way of a respective press valve in each case, 
characterized in that
 the 
computer (16) opens or closes the two press valves (18) in accordance with the respective 

path measurements and the associated speeds. 
A control means according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in that
 after  
 

the end of the pressing path the lower ram (2) is controlled before ejecting the finished 
green brick onto a short-distance withdrawal means.
