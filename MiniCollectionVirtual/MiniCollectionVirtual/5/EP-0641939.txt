<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a fastening device, in particular for the installation of door linings of motor vehicles, comprising a first element (3) with an anchoring foot (7) for the installation of the first element (3) in the first of the parts to be fastened, a second element (5) arranged on the second of the parts to be fastened, and a third element (33) fastening the first and second elements (3, 5), it being possible to fasten the first and third elements (3, 33) to each other in such a manner, by means of a plurality of respective first and second interlocking ribs (13, 35), that when the first and second parts are fastened, tolerances can be compensated for in the direction of the longitudinal axis of the fastening part (1), and it being possible to bring the second and third elements (5, 33) into engagement by means of a translatory movement in a plane perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the fastening device. The invention furthermore relates to a simplified, two-part embodiment of a fastening device.

Fastening element, in particular for fitting door 
trim pads of motor vehicles, comprising a first element 

(3), in particular with an anchoring foot (7) for fitting 
the first element (3) in a first part, and a second 

element (5) arranged on a second part to be fastened to 
the first part, it being possible for the first and 

second elements (3, 5) to be connected to one another by 
means of a plurality of first and second engagement ribs 

(13, 21) in each case in such a way that, when the first 
part is fastened to the second part, a compensation of 

tolerances can take place in the direction of the longitudinal 
axis of the fastening part (1), characterized in 

that the first element (3) has a top part (11), on whose 
outer circumference the first engagement ribs (13) are 

provided, which interact with the second engagement ribs 
(21) provided on the inner side of a wall (17, 19) of the 

second element (5) extending essentially in the direction 
of the longitudinal axis of the fastening element (1), 

and in that the wall (17, 19) of the second element (5) 
is designed to be open on one side at least in such a way 

that the top part (11) of the first element (3) can be 
inserted into the second element (5) at least from this 

one direction. 
Fastening element according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the top part (11) is designed to be 

circular, oval or rectangular in cross-section. 
Fastening element according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the first element (3) has a neck 

(31) which engages in a recess (29) in an end-face wall 
(27) connected to the wall (17, 19) of the second element  

 
(5). 
Fastening element according to one of Claims 1 to 
3, characterized in that the anchoring foot (7) is 

connected to the first element (3) by means of one or 
more webs (25) which are resilient at least in a plane 

perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the fastening 
element (1). 
Fastening element according to Claim 4, characterized 
in that the top part (11) has 
an axial bore, and 
the webs (25) are arranged between the inner wall and a 

continuation (23) of the anchoring foot (7).
