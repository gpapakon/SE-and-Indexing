<ABSTRACT>
A method for reducing NOX emissions in a chemical 
reaction process wherein ammonia is formed as a by-product 

of the chemical reaction and wherein the chemical reaction 
product is separated into desired fractions by 

distillation utilizing steam-heated reboilers, wherein the 
steam for use in the reboilers is generated in a steam 

generator by the burning of a hydrocarbon fuel with air, 
whereby NOX combustion by-products are formed, 

characterized in that at least a portion of the by-product 
ammonia is injected into the combustion gases to thereby 

convert at least a portion of the NOX combustion products 
to molecular nitrogen and water vapor.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for reducing the 
amount of NOX contaminants generated in the practice of a 
chemical manufacturing process wherein ammonia is formed as a 
by-product of the chemical process. More particularly, this 
invention is directed to a method wherein ammonia generated 
during a chemical manufacturing process is used to reduce the 
NOX content of flue gas formed during the generation of steam 
for use in the chemical process. Still more particularly, 
this invention is directed to a method wherein the feed used 
in heating a reboiler in a distillation zone for the distillation 
of chemical reaction products is generated in a steam 
generator by the combustion of a hydrocarbon fuel with air and 
wherein ammonia formed during the chemical reaction is used to 
convert at least a portion of the NOX compounds in the hot 
combustion gases in the steam generator to molecular nitrogen 
and water. Even more particularly, this invention is directed 
to an improvement in a method wherein the steam for use in 
heating a reboiler in a distillation zone for the distillation 
of a chemical reaction product is generated in a steam 
generator comprising a wet steam generation segment and a 
superheated steam generation segment, wherein hot combustion  
 
gases are generated by the burning of a hydrocarbon fuel 
and air in the steam generator whereby NOX combustion by-products 
are formed, wherein the hot combustion gases are 
channelled to provide a flowing stream of hot combustion 
gases that counter-currently, sequentially flows through 
the superheated steam generation segment and the wet steam 
generation segment to a flue and wherein ammonia is formed 
as one of the chemical reaction products in the chemical 
process, the improvement comprising the steps of 
recovering at least a portion of the ammonia in the 
reaction product and injecting it into the steam generator 
into the flowing stream of combustion gases at an 
injection point intermediate to superheated steam 
generation segment and the wet stream generation segment 
to thereby convert at least a portion of the NOX 
combustion product to molecular nitrogen and water vapor. It is known to prepare molybdenum-containing 
solutions. One such method is disclosed by Sorgenti in US 
Patent No. 3573226 wherein molybdenum powder is heated 
with a stream containing unreacted tertiary butyl 
hydroperoxide. Marquis et al. in US Patent No. 4626596, US Patent 
No. 4650886 and US Patent No, 4703027 disclose methods for 
the synthesis of
