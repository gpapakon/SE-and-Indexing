<ABSTRACT>
A sanitary napkin (210) is provided with a barrier means (107) to provide a barrier against lateral migration of body fluids. The barrier means (107) can be provided on a sanitary napkin (210) which has no wings and comprises in this core a distal edge (278, 278') which is located within the perimeter of the absorbent core (212) during use of the sanitary napkin. The barrier means (107) can also be provided on a sanitary napkin (210) having wings (224, 224') and can be formed of a unitary part of the napkin's topsheet (214) or can be formed by a separate strip of material.

<DESCRIPTION>
 'Sanitary Napkin Having Barrier Means"Field of the InventionThe invention relates to a sanitary napkin comprising an absorbent core having a first face, a second face, a perimeter comprising two longitudinal sides and two lateral sides, a liquid-pervious topsheet overlaying the first face of the core, a liquid-impervious backsheet associated with the topsheet, the backsheet overlying the second face of the core, and barrier means located along the longitudinal sides for restricting liquid migration in a direction generally parallel to the lateral sides.Background of the InventionSuch a sanitary napkin is known from the British patent application GB 2 168 253.In this patent application, the barrier means are located outside the perimeter of the core and are formed by an elasticised upstanding part of the topsheet and the backsheet. While lateral liquid migration is reduced by the barrier means, the rate of absorption of liquid entrapped between 

the barrier means and the core may be reduced. The known sanitary napkin may also undergo a shift in position during use.It is an object of the invention to provide for barrier means in a sanitary napkin which are comfortable during use, which effectively restrict lateral spread of body fluids and which allow adequate absorption.It is another object of the invention to provide a sanitary napkin which can be reliably positioned with respect to a user's undergarment.Summary of the InventionA sanitary napkin according to the invention is characterized in that the barrier means comprise a wall having a free edge which is elevated above the plane of the first face of the core, the free edge being, at least during use of the sanitary napkin, located within the perimeter of the core.By placing the barrier means so that at least the free edge is during use located on top of the absorbent core, instead of beside it, the liquid that is stopped by the barrier means from laterally spreading along the topsheet, is readily absorbed by the core.Another absorbent article according to the invention is characterized in that the backsheet extends beyond the perimeter of the core to form flaps for attachment to a garment during use, the barrier means comprising a wall that is connected to the flaps adjacent the perimeter of the core.The flaps can fold upward around the edge of an undergarment of the wearer, as is disclosed in US-A-4,687,478 which is hereby incorporated by reference. It was found, that the flaps in combination with the barrier means provide for reduced lateral

CLAIMS
1. Sanitary napkin comprising
an absorbent core having a first face, a second face, a perimeter comprising two longitudinal sides and two lateral sides,
a topsheet overlaying the first face of the core,
a liquid impervious backsheet associated with the topsheet, the backsheet overlying the second face of the core and
barrier means located along the longitudinal sides for restricting liquid migration in a general direction of the lateral sides, characterized in that the barrier means comprise a wall having a free edge which is elevated above the plane of the first face of the core, the free edge being-, at least during use of the sanitary napkin, located within the perimeter of the core.
2. Sanitary napkin according to Claim 1, characterized in that the backsheet extends beyond the perimeter of the core to form flaps for attachment to a garment during use, the barrier means being connected to the flaps adjacent the perimeter of the core.
3. Sanitary napkin comprising
an absorbent core having a first face, a second face, a perimeter comprising two longitudinal sides and two lateral sides,
a topsheet overlaying the first face of the core,
a liquid-impervious backsheet associated with the topsheet, the backsheet overlying the second face of the core and 


 barrier means located along the longitudinal sides for restricting liquid migration in a direction generally parallel to the lateral sides, characterized in that the backsheet extends beyond the perimeter of the core to form flaps for attachment to a garment during use, the barrier means comprising a wall that is connected to the flaps adjacent the perimeter of the core.
4. Sanitary napkin according to Claims 1, 2 or 3, characterized in that the wall is formed by a spacing member located between the topsheet and the backsheet.
5. Sanitary napkin according to Claim 4, characterized in that the spacing member comprises a cantilever strip.
6. Sanitary napkin according to Claim 1, characterized in that the spacing member is located between the topsheet and the core.
7. Sanitary napkin according to Claim 6, characterized in that the spacing member comprises a foam strip.
8. Sanitary napkin according to any of Claims 1 to 7, characterized in that the barrier means comprises the topsheet, the topsheet having a central part overlaying the core and marginal parts forming the wall along the longitudinal sides of the core.
9. Sanitary napkin according to Claim 8 characterized in that the marginal parts of the topsheet also extend along the lateral sides of the core.
10. Sanitary napkin according to any of Claims 1 to 9, characterized in that the barrier means comprises the backsheet.
11. Sanitary napkin according to Claim 1, 2, 3, 8, 9 or 10, characterized in that the free edge of the wall of the barrier means is provided with contraction means. 


12. Sanitary napkin according to Claim 11, characterized in that the contraction means comprise an elastic member.
13. Sanitary napkin according to-Claim 11 , characterized in that the contraction means is provided by shortening the free edge by crimping.
