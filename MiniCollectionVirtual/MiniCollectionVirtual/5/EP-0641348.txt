<DESCRIPTION>
Novel bisphosphonic acid derivatives and their useFIELD OF INVENTIONThis invention relates to a novel type of bisphosphonic acid derivatives, more specifically to methylene bisphos¬ phonic acid derivatives substituted at the methylene carbon with an optionally bridged vinylbenzyl group. The invention also relates to the use of the novel compounds for making functionally modified, preferably macroporous styrene polymers. The invention further relates to making functionally modified, mechanically durable styrene polymers crosslinked with a bis(vinylphenyl) -type com¬ pound. The said reactive polymers find a variety of use, e.g. as a support for catalysts in chemical reactions and in separation technology.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONFunctional groups may be attached to a polymer chain according to two methods: by functionalizing during manufacture of the polymer, i.e. by copolymerizing with a monomer carrying the functional group, or by modifying the chain chemically. The latter method is the one most in use today, but the former has a number of advantages, one being that the number of manufacturing steps and thus side product formation can be reduced.Porous or macroporous styrene materials are structures formed by agglomerated microspheres (100-200 nm) consist¬ ing in turn of cores (10-30 nm) (Jacobelli H. , Guyot A. , Angew. akrom. Che . , 80, (1979), 31) . Both between the cores and the agglomerates there are interconnected pores which provide for the large surface area of the polymer. These polymers have found a number of applications, especially within organic chemistry in the form of polymer bound catalysts, reagents and in chro atographic separati- 

 on processes. Polymer bound enzymes,- controlled dosage of medicines, pesticides and cosmetics are also used. The materials also find use for the purification of water, other liquids and gases.Although the research regarding polymer bound reagents is very intensive, there are today only a few industrial applications in use. The reason for this is, from a polymer chemical point of view, three namely diffusion restrictions within the polymer, insufficient mechanical characteristics and insufficient chemical inertness of the material. Diffusion restriction within the polymer makes the activity of the reagent low, if the diffusion rate into and out from the polymer becomes the rate controlling step. Insufficient mechanical strength makes the polymer break down, difficult to separate and re-use. Functional residues, side products and remaining double bonds
