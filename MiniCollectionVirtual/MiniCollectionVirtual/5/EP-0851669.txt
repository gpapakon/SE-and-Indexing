<ABSTRACT>
The present invention has as an object providing a
color transforming method by which transformation can be

effected easily making maximum use of the reproduction range
and without causing any distortions in a color space while

maintaining color and gradation balances between different
conditions (of device, medium or reproducing condition) in

different ranges of color reproduction, which has been
difficult to satisfy in the prior art. This object can be

attained by a color transforming method which performs color
correction between reproduced images under different

conditions, the method comprising the steps of: 1)
calculating (predicting) the colorimetric color reproducing

characteristics under each condition; 2) determining
equivalent neutral attribute data from each of said color

reproducing characteristics; 3) determining the mapping of
said equivalent neutral attribute data with respect to

lightness, luminance or light quantity; 4) using the scale
of said lightness, luminance or light quantity as a

gradation correction curve; 5) determining, on the basis of
a maximum and a minimum device value that can be reproduced

(theoretically) under each of said conditions, the range
over which mapping from said equivalent neutral attribute

data to the gradation correction curve is possible; 6)
varying the characteristics of the gradation correction

curves for said two conditions so as to change the intensity
of the mapping function and determine the function of 

transformation between gradation curves; and 7) combining
the functions of mapping from the equivalent neutral

attribute data to the gradation correction curve under said
(any) two conditions with the intermediary of the determined

function of transformation between gradation curves, thereby
constructing a function of one-to-one mapping for each color

component between the equivalent neutral attribute data
under said (any) two conditions, for example, from C to C',

M to M', Y to Y' and K to K' between equivalent neutral ink
values.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a color transforming method which, under two different conditions such as the use of different media, devices or reproducing conditions, performs color correction and transformation such that an image reproduced under a given condition can be reproduced optimally under the other condition.In hard copies such as those produced by printing or soft copies such as those produced by CRT display devices, colors are generally reproduced by performing area (dot percent) or density modulation of CMYK or RGB on a support. Many methods have been proposed with a view to achieving colorimetric agreements using such devices and media. Aside from the possible problem with precision, two methods are commonly known, one being the direct performance of mapping transformation as described in JP 03-131920 A which makes use of color transforming tables that are predetermined for hard copies produced with a specified printer and under specified printing conditions, and the other method involving the determination of the most likely solution of a masking coefficient such as to achieve an agreement between colorimetric values under two conditions as described in JP 04-362869A.However, in general system configurations, more diverse variations are desired on the basis of colorimetric reproduction. One of them is an operation by which an image reproduced under a certain condition (e.g. device, medium or reproducing condition) is transformed in a way that best matches another condition which varies significantly in terms of color reproducing characteristics. In the case of prints which are most common hard copies, the color reproducing characteristics are largely dependent on the properties of the color material (e.g. ink) or support (e.g. paper) used and in order to effect transformation between two different color reproducing conditions such that the range of color reproduction under a different condition can be utilized most effectively while preserving or appropriately correcting color tones and gradations, much time and efforts are currently required on a trial-and-error basis. For example, if the ink or paper used under a certain color reproducing condition is changed, the range of a color reproduction may occasionally vary between the two cases this occurs, it is necessary that the colorimetric reproduction of the initial color reproducing condition be preserved as much as possible while effecting mapping to a second color reproducing space associated with the different ink or paper. To meet this
