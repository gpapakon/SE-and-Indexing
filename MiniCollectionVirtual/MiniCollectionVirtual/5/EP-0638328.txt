<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a checkvalve with a housing (10) with axial passage (13) and a valve seat interacting with a valve disc (33) which is made of a resilient material, is located inside a sealing ring (31) and is connected via a local connection point (32) to the sealing ring (31). The sealing ring (31) is clamped between upper and lower annular surfaces (19, 26) of the housing (10) which surround the valve seat (20) concentrically, and the housing (10) is inserted in a liquid line of an infusion or transfusion device, and the passage (13) carries liquid. Such a checkvalve is particularly suitable, inter alia, for prevention of backflow of liquids during infusions, especially multiple infusions, to the containers holding the infusion solutions. Maximum safety is achieved on use of infusion pumps.
