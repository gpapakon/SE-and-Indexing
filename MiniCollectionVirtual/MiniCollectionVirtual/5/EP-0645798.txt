<ABSTRACT>
Magnetron sputtering apparatus is disclosed having an 
inner magnetic pole (12) and an outer magnetic pole (13) having a 

polarity opposite to that of the inner magnetic pole and 
ranged to surround the inner magnetic pole, and a target (11) 

disposed at least above the inner magnetic pole and 
extending therefrom towards the outer magnetic pole. A soft 

magnetic material (8) divided into plural discreet sections is 
mounted on the back of the target between the inner and 

outer magnetic poles, and is adapted to decrease the 
vertical component of the leakage magnetic field at a 

central portion between the inner and outer magnetic poles, 
and to increase it at a portion in the vicinity of magnetic 

poles, and thereby to cause the distribution of intensity of 
a horizontal component of the magnetic field between the 

poles to adopt an M-shaped form, having peaks towards the 
magnetic poles and a trough therebetween. In preferred 

embodiments, the magnetron apparatus further comprises a 
first permanent magnet (16) having magnetization predominantly in 

the horizontal direction disposed between the inner and 
outer magnetic poles, and a second permanent magnet (17) having 

magnetization predominantly in the direction opposite to 
that of the first magnet, disposed on an outer side of the 

outer magnetic pole.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magnetron 
sputtering apparatus and, more particularly, to a 
magnetron sputtering apparatus capable of readily 
retaining plasma in a stable manner even in case of a 
large-scale magnetron or in case where target of a 
ferromagnetic material is sputtered. The present invention 
also relates to a magnetron sputtering apparatus in which 
local erosion of the target is blocked, thereby 
prolonging life of the target, and in which a variation 
in a sputtering rate can be made to an extremely small 
extent during operation. A conventional magnetron sputtering device will be 
described with reference to FIG. 13, in which FIG. 13(a) 
is a perspective view showing such a magnetron sputtering 
device and FIG. 13(b) is a cross-sectional view showing 
the magnetron sputtering device taken along line PA- PB of 
FIG. 13(a). As shown in FIG. 13, reference numeral l 
denotes target composed of a non-magnetic material or a 
ferromagnetic material. On the back side of the target l 
are disposed an inner magnetic pole 2 and an outer 
magnetic pole 3 disposed so as to enclose the inner magnet 
2 and having polarity opposite to that of the inner 
magnetic pole 2. To their bottom portions is connected a 
magnetic yoke 4 composed usually of a magnetic material 
such as steel or the like. The sputtering device having the foregoing 
configuration is accommodated in a vacuum container. When 
the magnetron sputtering device is in use, the container 
is filled with argon gas at low pressures and voltage is  
 
applied between the target and a substrate (not shown), such as 
a disc, thereby ionizing the argon gas and generating electrons 
from the target surface. The argon ions bombard the target to 
cause the target substance to be generated and to form a thin 
film on a surface of the substrate. The magnetic field formed 
by the two magnetic poles 2 and 3 can effectively catch the 
electrons and promote ionization of the argon gas, thereby 
improving the effectiveness of sputtering. For conventional magnetron sputtering devices having the 
configuration described hereinabove, it is considered that the 
electrons caught around the surface of the target l are enclosed 
by the magnetic field formed in the shape of a semi-circular dome 
as indicated by arrows in Fig. 13(a) and move along the dome-like 
magnetic field configuration. Thus, occurrence of erosion on the 
surface of the target l depends upon distribution of the magnetic 
field over the upper surface of the target l, in other words, 
upo
