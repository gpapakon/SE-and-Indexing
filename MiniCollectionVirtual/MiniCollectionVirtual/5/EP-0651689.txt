<ABSTRACT>
The proposal is for a holder (1) for tools and other objects, essentially consisting of at least one rail (3) of constant cross-section over its length and a plurality of holding means (4) secured thereto, in which said holding means consist of a strip (9) of elastic material of given length and width having securing means (8) suitable for the rail and designed for arrangement thereon at both ends (15, 16). It is bent in a U-shape and its ends (11, 12) form legs secured to be movable along the rail (3). The strips (9), in the central region (10) of their length, are narrower than in the two end regions (11, 12) forming the legs, and stiffening means (20, 21) directed towards the base of the rail (3) and projecting into the inner space formed by the strips (9) bent into a U-shape are arranged on the inside (19) of the strip in the centre of the broader end regions (11, 12).

<CLAIMS>
A holder for tools and other objects, essentially 
comprising at least one rail (3 or 3') which has a 

uniform cross-section over its length and a plurality of 
holding means (4 or 4') secured thereon, these holding 

means each comprising a strip (9) produced from elastic 
material and having a given length and width, which strip 

has securing means (8), which are adapted to the rail and 
are designed to be arranged thereon, at both of its ends 

and, having been bent round to form a U, is secured by 
its ends (11 and 12) forming limbs on the rail so as to 

be displaceable in the longitudinal direction thereof, 
characterized in that the strip (9) is of narrower design 

in the central region (10) of its length (L) than in the 
two end regions (11 and 12) forming the limbs (11' and 

12'), and in that reinforcing means (20 and 21), projecting 
into the inner space (22) formed by the strip 

(9), which is bent in the shape of a U, and directed 
towards the bottom of the rail (3), are arranged on the 

inside (19) of the strip (9) in each case in the centre 
of the wider end regions (11 and 12). 
A holder according to claim 1, characterized in 
that at least the upper edge (13') is curved arcuately 

inwards in the central region (10') of the strip (9'). 
A holder according to claim 1, characterized in 
that both the upper and lower edges (13 and 14, respectively) 

are curved arcuately inwards in the central 
region (10) of the strip (9). 
A holder according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the reinforcing means (20 and 21) are formed  

 
integrally on the strip (9). 
A holder according to claim 4, characterized in 
that the reinforcing means (20 and 21) are designed as 

tongues which are moulded so as to project out of the 
strip (9). 
A holder according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the reinforcing means (20 and 21) touch the bottom 

of the rail (3) or are supported thereon. 
A holder according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the reinforcing means (20 and 21) are designed as 

additional holding means for smaller objects. 
A holder according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the rail (3) has an essentially U-shaped profile, in 

which the free ends of the two limbs (5 and 6) are in 
each case bent inwards at right angles.
