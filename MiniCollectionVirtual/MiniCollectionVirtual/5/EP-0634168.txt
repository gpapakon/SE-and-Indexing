<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to β-alanyl-L-glutamine-containing nutrient 
compositions such as infusions and nutrient preparations. As a means for supplementing nutrients administered to mammals including 
humans either orally or through injection, it is known to add individual amino acids 
either alone or in combination with proteins, vitamins and the like. For example, 
nutrients given to a patient in post-operative catabolic condition must be supplemented 
with L-glutamine since the quantity of L-glutamine in the muscle of such a patient is 
seriously decreased. However, because of its heat instability, L-glutamine itself 
cannot be added to a nutrient composition which requires heat sterilisation prior to 
use. Against that, it is known to supply L-glutamine to nutrient compositions in the 
form of a dipeptide, for example, as L-alanyl-L-glutamine (JPA-61-247354), L-aspartyl-L-glutamine 
(JPA-62-151156) or as L-glutamyl-L-glutamine (WO90/11024, 
USP5134125). Compared with L-glutamine itself the heat stability of such dipeptides 
is improved but is still unsatisfactory. An L-glutamine-containing substance of improved heat stability is therefore 
still much in demand. In accordance with the present invention it has been found that β-alanyl-L-glutamine-containing 
nutrient compositions have that stability and an improved 
solubility in water. Examples of nutrient compositions which may be supplemented with β-alanyl-L-glutamine 
in accordance with this invention include amino acid infusions and 
nutrient preparations. Usually such amino acid infusions will contain in addition to β-alanyl-L-glutamine, 
at least one essential amino acid, such as glycine and L-isomers of 
isoleucine, leucine, lysine, phenylalanine, methionine, threonine, tryptophan, valine, 
arginine, histidine, alanine, aspartic acid, cysteine, glutamic acid, proline, serine and 
tryosine and salts of those essential amino acids. If necessary, the amino acid 
infusions may additionally contain carbohydrates such as glucose, fructose, xylitol, 
sorbitol and maltose, polyhydric alcohols such as glycerol, lipids such as soy bean 
oil, cotton seed oil, sesame oil, yolk lecithin and soy bean lecithin, vitamins such as 
vitamin A, vitamin B₁, vitamin B₂, vitamin B₆, nicotinic acid, pantothenic acid,  
 
vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, biotin and folic acid, electrolytes such as sodium 
chloride, sodium acetate, potassium chloride, magnesium sulphate, magnesium 
chloride, calcium chloride, dipotassium hydrogenphosphate and sodium 
dihydrogenpho
