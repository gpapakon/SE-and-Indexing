<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is a process improvement for 
producing [R-(R*, R*)]-5-(3-chlorophenyl)-3-[2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-1-methylethyl]-2-oxazolidinone 
which is 
an intermediate useful in making compounds that have 
antidiabetic and/or antihyperglycemic and/or antiobesity 
properties in mammals. United States Patent No. 5,061,727 teaches one 
method of making the desired oxazolidinone product. The 
oxazolidinone is isolated after an aqueous quench, 
extraction with an organic solvent, concentration, 
trituration with methyl alcohol and recrystallization in 
75% overall yield and 80-90% purity.  
 The invention is a one step process 
improvement for synthesizing a compound of Formula 1: 
 
which comprises: 
1.) reacting a compound of the formula: 
 
with boron tribromide in methylene chloride, under argon 
or nitrogen, at -15 to +20°C, preferably -10 to 
+15°C for 0.5-2 hours; 2.) quenching the reaction mixture, at -5 to 
10°C, preferably 0 to 10°C with methyl alcohol; 3.) concentrating the reaction mixture, by 
distillation of methylene chloride; 4.) adding room temperature water to 
reaction; 5.) and collecting the precipitated 
crystalline product of formula 1. The advantages of this process over the cited 
literature are higher yields of product; higher purity 
of product; the elimination of a separate purification 
step; and the prevention of the formation of gummy 
solids, which are undesirable in kilogram scale 
reactions. The process if further improved by the 
simultaneous addition of boron tribromide and a 
solution of [R-(R*,R*)]-5-(3-chlorophenyl-3-[2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-1-methylethyl]-2-oxazolidinone 
in 
methylene chloride to methylene chloride while 
maintaining a constant ratio of 2.10:1.00 of boron 
tribromide to the substrate [R-(R*,R*)]-5-(3-chlorophenyl-3-[2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-1-methylethyl]-2-oxazolidinone 
at a temperature of -5°C to 10°C gives 
[R-(R*, R*)]-5-(3-chlorophenyl-3-[2-(3,4-hydroxyoxyphenyl)-1-methylethyl]-2-oxazolidinone 
in an 
isolated yield of 86.7% and a purity of 98.7%.  
  
Referring to Scheme 1, [R-(R*,R*)]-5-(3-chlorophenyl)-3-[2-(3,4-dimethyloxyphenyl)-1-methylethyl]-2-oxazolidinone, 
obtained by literature 
procedures previously cited, is dissolved in methylene 
chloride, under argon or nitrogen at 0-5oC and boron 
tribromide is added, dropwise, to the reaction mixture. 
The progress of the reaction is monitored by thin layer 
chromatography or high pressure liquid chromatography. 
When the reaction is complete, it is quenched slowly 
with methyl alcohol at

<CLAIMS>
A process for making a compound of formula 
1: 


 
which comprises: 


a) reacting, at -15° to +20°, [R(R*,R*)]-5-(3-chlorophenyl)-3-[2-(3,4-dimethyoxyphenyl)-1-methylethyl]
-2-oxazolidinone 
with boron tribromide in 

methylene chloride, under argon for from 0.5 to 2 hours; 
b) quenching the reaction mixture of -5 to 
10°C with methyl alcohol; 
c) concentrating the reaction mixture, by 
distillation of methylene chloride; 
d) adding room temperature water to the 
reaction residue; and 
e) collecting the precipitated crystalline 
product of formula 1. 
The process of claim 1 wherein the 
reaction
 is at 0 to 5°C and the reaction mixture is 
quenched at 0 to 10°C. 
The process of claim 1 the reaction 
comprises adding: 


(a) a of methylene chloride solution of [R(R*,R*)]-5-(3-chlorophenyl-3-[2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-1-methylethyl]
-2-oxazolidinone to methylene chloride while 
simultaneously adding boron tribromide at  

 
-5° to 10°C under inert gas at a rate so the ratio of boron 

tribromide to substrate is 2.10:1.00; 
(b) quenching the reaction mixture with methyl 
alcohol at -5° to 10°C; 
(c) concentrating the reaction mixture by 
distillation of the methylene chloride and a portion of the 

methyl alcohol; 
(d) adding water to the reaction mixture; 
(e) collecting the product by filtration and drying.
