<ABSTRACT>
A photosensitive resin composition for color filters, which comprises a novolak resin containing repeating 
units represented by general formula (I) and having a molecular weight of about 1,000 to 50,000, a solvent, and a dye 

or pigment, and which is excellent in various performances including resolution, heat resistance and transparency. In 
formula (I) R₁ through R₅ represent each hydrogen, alkyl, etc.; and R₆ and R₇ represent each hydrogen, alkyl, etc., 

provided that the α group is located at the o- or p-position with respect to the OH group.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the photosensitive
resin compositions for color filter, more particularly
to the positive and negative photosensitive resin
compositions for color filter.Color filters, especially those for solid
image forming devices such as charge-coupled devices
(CCD) and liquid crystal display devices (LCD) are used
for forming a pattern of three primary colors (red,
green and blue) or three complementary colors (yellow,
magenta and cyan) on a transparent or opaque substrate.
Regarding the photosensitive resin compositions for such
color filters, JP-A-4-175753 and JP-A-4-175754 disclose
respectively a photosensitive resin composition for
color filter comprising (A) a novolak resin obtained by
polycondensing a phenolic material containing 50 mol% or
more of bisphenol A and an aldehyde, as an alkali-soluble
resin, (B) a light-modifiable dissolution
inhibitor, (C) a dye soluble in the solvent (D) and
compatible with the resin (A), and (D) a solvent, and a
composition comprising (A), (B), (D) and (C') a
particulate pigment. However, use of such positive photosensitive
resin compositions for color filter involves the
problems of change of pattern shape and discoloration of
color filter because of high-temperature and long-time
heating that is required after pattern formation.The present invention provides a photosenstive
resin composition for color filter which is excellent in
various properties such as resolution, heat resistance
and transparency (light transmission properties).The present invention consists in a
photosensitive resin composition for color filter
characterized in that it contains a novolak resin having
at least one type of recurring unit selected from the
group of the recurring units represented by the
following general formulae (I)-(III):

[wherein R1 to R5 represent independently a hydrogen
atom, a halogen atom, a straight-chain or branched alkyl
or alkenyl group which may be substituted, or an acetyl
group; and R6 and R7 represent independently a hydrogen
atom, an alkyl group which may be substituted, a benzyl 
group or a phenyl group provided that

group is
coordinated at the o- or p-position in relation to the
-OH group];

[wherein R8 to R13 represent independently a hydrogen
atom, a halogen atom, a straight-chain or branched alkyl
or alkenyl group which may be substituted, or an acetyl
group; and R14 and R15 represent independently a
hydrogen atom, an alkyl group which may be substituted,
a benzyl group or a phenyl group provided that

group
is coordinated at the o- or
