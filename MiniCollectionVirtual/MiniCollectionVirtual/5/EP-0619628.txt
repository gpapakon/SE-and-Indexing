<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an electrical connection device which includes two connection elements, one of which is movable, these being arranged so as to be able to be mated and unmated with each other by rotation of the moving element in the other element, and to connect, or conversely separate, the opposing contacts (3,3'; 4,4') with which they are provided. The invention is especially noteworthy in that the device constitutes a connector, the movable element being a movable plug (1') and the other element a connector socket (2), and in that the socket is provided with a protective element (5) which conceals, when not in use, the contacts (3,3') of the said socket and which is mounted so as to rotate in the latter so as to be able to be rotationally driven by the movable plug during mating, whereas the said protective element (5) includes two flaps (8,9) which may slide, one with respect to the other, and which are each provided with at least as many openings (10,10'; 11,11') as there are contacts in the socket and which are arranged in the same manner, the said flaps being positioned, when not in use, one with respect to the other, so that the said openings are mutually offset and means being provided for making the flaps slide, one with respect to the other, during mating.

is portable and which are arranged so as to be able to be coupled together 

and uncoupled and to put in connection, or conversely separate, opposing 
contacts (3,3';4,4') with which they are provided, the contacts of at least 

the non portable element having contact pieces (3, 3') which extend 
parallel with each other and define a connection direction, while coupling 

and uncoupling are effected by rotation of the portable element within the 
other element about an axis arranged geometrically in such a way as to be 

perpendicular to the said connection direction, characterised in that it 
constitutes a connector, the portable element being a portable plug (1,1') 

and the other element a connector socket outlet (2), and in that the socket 
outlet is provided with a protection element (5) which during rest hides 

the contact pieces (3,3') of the said socket outlet and which is mounted 
rotatably in the latter in such a way as to be able to be driven in 

rotation by the portable plug during coupling, while the said protection 
element (5) has two flaps (8,9) which may slide in relation to each other 

and which are each provided with at least as many openings (10,10';11,11') 
as there are contact pieces in the socket outlet and which are arranged in 

the same way, the said flaps being positioned during rest one in relation 
to the other in such a way that the said openings are offset from each 

other and means being provided to bring about the sliding of the flaps one 
in relation to the other during the coupling until bringing about the 

juxtaposition of the said openings (10,10';11,11') through which the 
contact pieces (3,3') of the socket outlet may then pass.

A connector in accordance with one of claims 1 to 3 characterised in 
that the protection element (5) has at least one means of locking in the 

initial position preventing all rotation, the said means being able to be 
unlocked by the portable plug (1,1') during its coupling. 
A connector in accordance with one of claims 1 to 4 characterised in 
that the
 means which bring about the sliding of the flaps of the socket 
outlet in relation to one another are arranged so that the said sliding is 

achieved during the rotation of at least the portable plug (1,1'). 
A connector in accordance with claim 5 characterised in that the 
means which bring about and/or maintain the sliding of the flaps of the 

socket outlet in relation to each other have at least one fixed cam (13b) 
arranged in the socket outlet (2) and at least one activating pin (12a,12b) 

which is fixed on one (9) of the flaps and which is intended to cooperate 
with the said cam. 
A connector in accordance with the combination of claims 4 and 6, 
characterised in that the means of locking the protection element (5) in 

the initial position is assured by the activating pin (12a,12b) which abuts  
 

on a part of the fixed cam (13b) and which is brought into the unlocked 
position by the plug (1, 1') during its coupling, which assures at the same 

time the sliding of the flaps in relation to one another, a sliding 
continued and/or maintained by the cooperation of the pin and the cam. 
A connector in accordance with claim 7 characterised in that the plug 
(1,1') engages the said activating pin (12a,12b) in order to bring about 

the unlocking and the sliding of the flaps by means of a curved front part 
(31) forming a cam.
