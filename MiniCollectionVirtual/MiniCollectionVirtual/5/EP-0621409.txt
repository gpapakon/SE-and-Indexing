A removable fastening device for fastening a
supporting and actuating element (2) and a tool (1), of

the type involving, on the tool, a tang locally shaped
like a tenon (11) with a dovetail-shaped cross section

and, on the element, a complementary notch (15) capable
of receiving the tang through axial sliding and, between

them, a removable fastening system (20) passing through
both the element and the tang,

   characterised in that :

the tang locally comprises, on the one hand, two
longitudinal edges (12) defining the tenon (11) and

converging at an angle (a) and, on the other hand, an
opening (14) located between said edges,
the supporting element comprises a notch (15)
defined by two longitudinal edges (18) complementing

those of the tenon and has, between said edges, a through
housing (21) opening into the notch so as to

substantially coincide with the opening when the tenon is
engaged in the notch,
the removable fastening system (20) comprises a
block (32) placed in communication with the housing and

carrying a mobile latch (22) arranged inside said
housing, provided with a locking head (23, 42) and

associated with means (24, 48, 53, 55) to manually drive
the head towards a removed position with respect to the

notch and to actuate the head towards a locking position
in which the head is engaged in the opening of the tenon

and acts on the edge of this opening to force said tenon
into a relative displacement inside the notch, along the

direction of convergence of the edges.
A device according to claim 1, characterised in
that the angle (a) is comprised between 18 and 22°. 
A device according to claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that the tenon (11) has a dovetail-shaped

cross section comprising edges (13) inclined at an
angle (b) comprised between 45 and 70°.
A device according to claim 1, characterised in
that the notch (15) of the supporting element is open.
A device according to claim 1, characterised in
that the latch (22) of the removable fastening system

(20) is revolving about an axis (y-y') perpendicular to
the plane of the bottom (16) of the notch and in that the

locking head (23) of said latch consists of a bearing
surface (28) off-centre with respect to the latch axis.
A device according to claim 5, characterised in
that the latch (22) consists of a cylindrical body (26)

revolving inside the housing (21), axially secured, and
prolonged at one end by the off-set bearing surface (28)

and, at the other end, by a stop (30) assuming the
functions of manual driving means and actuating means.
A device according to claim 6, characterised in
that the stop (30) comprises, opposite to the off-centre

bearing surface (28), on the one hand, a cylindrical
bearing surface (36) coaxial with the body, passing

through the body to cooperate with a rotational locking
means (34) and, on the other hand, along the axis of said

bearing surface, a prolongation (33) protruding from the
body and capable of driving the body into rotation inside

the housing.
A device according to claim 7, characterised in
that the latch body (26) has, in its part connected to

the stop (30), a shouldering (29) located beneath the
locking means (34) which consists of a radial screw

mounted in the block to assume an additional axial thrust
bearing function and in that the cylindrical body (26)

has, in its peripheral wall and in alignment with the 
off-centre part of the bearing surface, an axial groove

(35) with a width corresponding to the diameter of the
screw.
A device according to claim 1, characterised in
that the latch of the removable fastening system (20)

comprises a body (26) carrying a head (23, 42)
substantially pivoted on a pin (41, 61) parallel to the

plane of the bottom (16) of the notch (15) and a head
actuating means consisting of a screw thrustor (48).
A device according to claim 9, characterised
in that the body (26) is carried by a pin (41, 61) with

the presence of elongated slots or holes (44, 60)
conferring a limited axial displacement freedom with the

head removed from the opening (14) along a direction
perpendicular to the plane of the bottom of the notch

(15) and in that said head includes a locking part (45)
capable of cooperating with the edge of the opening when

acted upon by the screw thrustor.
A device according to claim 9, characterised
in that the body is an integral part of the block and

contains the pivoting head (42) which forms, on the one
hand, the locking part (45) and, on the other hand, a

manual control means (53) passing through the block.
A device according to claim 9, characterised
in that the body forms the locking head on its own.
A device according to claim 9, characterised
in that the screw thrustor (48) is inserted between the

block (32) or supporting element (2) and the pivoting

head (42).
A device according to claim 9, characterised
in that the manual control means consists of a button

formed by the body on the exterior of the block.
A device according to claim 9, characterised
in that an elastic return element (49, 63), with the head 

in the removed position, is inserted between the latter
and the body or block.
