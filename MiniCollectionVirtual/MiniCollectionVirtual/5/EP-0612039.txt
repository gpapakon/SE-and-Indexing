<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of preventive
maintenance for plant components, e.g. a method of improvement
of reliability for nuclear plants, thermal electric power
plants, chemical plants, etc., a method of their operation
control and control device, and their system.Specifically, it relates to a method of
improvement of reliability on the plant components for
constructing the plant which improves the reliability on the
plant component and a method of operation control for the
plants and their control device and system by preventing the
degradation such as a stress corrosion cracking (which will
be abbreviated as a SCC thereafter) of an environmental
assisted degradation.In a prior art, it is desired to establish the technology
of prediction, a selection method of maintenance for
the degradation of the material of component in an
industrial plant, such as the degradation of the component
parts in a specific operating plant or plant under design
or construction for preventing SCC and a
direction to the optimal development of preventive
maintenance. In other words, it is desired to establish an evaluation
method for being capable of quantitatively extracting the
potential point of SCC every each position of the plant
component for the preventive maintenance of SCC in the
material of component. It is also necessary to establish
a technology of evaluation which can be made use of as a
technical specification at the designing and preparing
stages of a new plant and which can exactly exclude some
points having possibility of the generation of SCC.Therefore, of all technologies of stress corrosion
cracking (SCC) in reliability engineering, as a prior art,
a theory of the factors of improvement has given its
remarkable contribution to the verification to 316 (316NG)
steel for nuclear energy utilization [R. Post and j. LeMaire
: Statistical Approach to Qualify Countermeasure; Proceeding
Seminar on Countermeasure for BWR Cracking: January 22-24,
1980 EPRI-WS'-174 (1980)].In the disclosure of Japanese Pat. Laid Open Pub.No. 3-5
5403, there is known a method of preventive maintenance
which evaluates the residual life of a plant component,
resulting in determining the inspection items at the next
time and arranging remedy, replacement and reconstruction.
At this time, the residual life of a plant component is
evaluated on the basis of the reference state, i.e., creep,
fatigue and oxides. However, SCC has not yet been taken
into consideration.Also, another method of evaluation of residual life 
is
