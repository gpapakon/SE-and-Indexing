<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides an imaging element comprising on a 
hydrophilic support a light sensitive layer containing a diazo resin 

or a diazonium salt characterized in that said light sensitive layer 
contains as a binder a polyvinylacetate hydrolysed to an extent of 

at least 95% by weight and a cationic fluor-containing surfactant. 
The hydrophilic support is preferably a support provided with a 

hydrophilic layer containing a hydrophilic (co)polymer or 
(co)polymer mixture and being hardened with a hydrolysed tetraalkyl 

orthosilicate crosslinking agent.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a diazo sensitized imaging
element which is developable by plain water to a lithographic
printing plate.Lithography is the process of printing from specially prepared
surfaces, some areas of which are capable of accepting lithographic
ink, whereas other areas, when moistened with water, will not accept
the ink. The areas which accept ink form the printing image areas
and the ink-rejecting areas form the background areas.In the art of photolithography, a photographic material is made
imagewise receptive to oily or greasy inks in the photo-exposed
(negative-working) or in the non-exposed areas (positive-working) on
a hydrophilic background.In the production of common lithographic printing plates, also
called surface litho plates or planographic printing plates, a
support that has affinity to water or obtains such affinity by
chemical treatment is coated with a thin layer of a photosensitive
composition. Coatings for that purpose include light-sensitive
polymer layers containing diazo compounds, dichromate-sensitized
hydrophilic colloids and a large variety of synthetic photopolymers.Particularly diazo-sensitized systems are widely used. These
systems have been extensively reviewed by Kosar J. in
"Light-Sensitive Systems", Wiley, New York, 1965, Chapter 7. A
generally used negative-working diazo-sensitized system is based on
the capability of diazo compounds to harden a polymer when exposed
to ultraviolet and blue radiation. Diazo compounds which have been
used for the preparation of lithographic printing plates based on
their hardening properties are e.g. diazonium salts whose photolysis
products can harden polymers (natural colloids or synthetic resins)
directly and diazonium polymers. Although polymers containing
diazonium groups have a large structure they remain water soluble
owing to the presence of the ionic diazonium groups. When these
groups are destroyed by exposure to light an insoluble resin is
formed. Particularly useful diazonium polymers are the condensation
products of a carbonyl compound, e.g. an aldehyde, such as 
formaldehyde, with a diazonium salt of e.g. a p-aminodiphenylamine.
These condensation products are usually designated diazo resins. In
these systems a polymeric binder is optionally added to the diazo
resin coating.Several types of supports can be used for the manufacturing of a
diazo-sensitized lithographic printing plate. Common supports are
metal supports like Al or Zn, polyester film supports and paper
bases. These supports, if not
