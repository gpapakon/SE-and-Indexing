<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a cartridge for reception of at least one data disc, comprising a housing and a disc-holder plate (12) arranged therein, in which arrangement the housing comprises a base part (10) and a cover (11), the base part (10) and the cover (11) in each case having a substantially flat, rectangular baseplate, on the lateral edges of which side walls are arranged, and the base part (10) and the cover (11) being connected in such a way that they can swivel with respect to each other by means of a swivel spindle. The swivel spindle is formed by pivot pins (30) on opposite side walls of the base part (10) or the cover (11), which pins engage in pin holes (24) made in the corresponding side walls (14) on the respective other part. To further develop a cartridge for data discs in such a way that a loosening of the swivel spindle connection between cover (11) and base part (10) is no longer possible when the cartridge is closed, it is proposed that the length of the pivot pin (30) is greater than the thickness of the side wall exhibiting the pivot hole (24). At the free end of the pivot pin (30) there is a radial enlargement (60), the diameter of which is greater than that of the pin hole (24). Furthermore, a push-in slot (62) for the pivot pin (30) is arranged from the free upper edge of the side wall (14) receiving the pin hole (24) to the pin hole (24).

<CLAIMS>
Case for data media disks having the following
features:


a) a housing for accommodating two data media disks,
which is composed of a base part (10) and a cover

(11) which each have an essentially flat,
rectangular base plate (13, 25) on whose side

edges side walls (14, 15, 26) are arranged,
b) a disk holder plate (12) which is connected to the
base part (10) via a rotating spindle (44) and is

arranged such that it can be raised in the
housing,
c) a pivoting shaft which connects the cover (11) and
the base part (10) to one another such that they

can pivot and is formed in such a manner that
rotating spindles (30) are formed on opposite side

walls (26) of the base part (10) or of the cover
(11) and engage in spindle holes (24) which are

formed in the corresponding side walls (14) on the
respective other part,
d) the length of the rotating spindle (30) which
connects the cover (11) and the base part (10) is

greater than the thickness of the side wall which
has the spindle hole (24),
e) a radial enlargement (60), whose diameter is
greater than that of the spindle hole (24), is

formed at the free end of the rotating spindle
(30), 
f) an insertion slot (62) for the rotating spindle
(30) is arranged from the free upper edge of the

side wall (14), which holds the spindle hole (24),
to the spindle hole (24).
Case according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the insertion slot (62) is designed essentially in

a V-shape, tapering towards the spindle hole (24).
Case according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the radial enlargement is a

concentric disc (60).
Case according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the rotating spindle (30) has a

bearing spindle (61) at the free end, behind the radial
enlargement.
Case according to Claim 4, characterized in
that the disk plate (12) has a bearing edge (63) which

rests on the bearing spindle (61) when the case is
closed.
