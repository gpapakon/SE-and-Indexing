<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical 
scanning device on which an LED array and an auto 
focussing element are provided in an integrated 
structure, particularly an optical scanning device 
which is a two wavelength LED printer provided with an 
LED for focal adjustment and a recording array which 
are integrally formed on the recording LED or laser 
array chip. In case of a high resolution printer using a light 
source, a light from a light source is not focussed on 
a sensitized paper due to irregularity of rotation of a 
photosensitive drum or deviation of the sensitized 
paper, and therefore, the printing quality 
deteriorates. Accordingly, the optical scanning device 
such as a printer requires an anti-defocusing 
mechanism. Conventionally an auto-focus mechanism for an 
optical scanning device using an optical element array 
has not been known. As an auto-focus mechanism for apparatuses other 
than the optical scanning device using the optical 
element array, an auto-focus adjusting technology using 
a reflected light from a disc in optical disc recording 
by means of a semiconductor laser has been generally 
known. This conventional auto-focus adjusting 
technology for optical disc recording is described 
below, referring to Fig. 8. In Fig. 8, 81 is a laser driver, 82 is a 
semiconductor laser, 83 is a collimator lens, 84 is a 
beam splitter, 85 is a 1/4 Î» plate, 86 is a focal lens,  
 
87 is a lens drive, 88 is a disc and 89 is a photo 
detector. A reflected light from the disc 88 is guided 
to the photo detector 89 through the beam splitter 84 
and a defocus deviation is detected. "Astigmatism" is shown in Fig. 9 as a 
representative detection method. In Fig. 9, a light 
flux which has passed through the cylindrical lens 91 
forms a circular spot on a light receiving surface 92 
as shown in (d) when the light is focussed but it forms 
an oval spot as shown in (c) or (e) when the light is 
defocused. The signal components of the light flux 
obtained by the 4-divided photo detector 89 (Fig. 8) 
are subtracted from each other to be used for alignment 
of the focal lens 93. The above prior art shown in Figs. 8 and 9 is an 
auto focussing technology for optical disc recording 
and is not an auto focussing technology for the optical 
scanning device using the optical-element array to 
which the present invention applies. Tokyo Kokai (Japanese Patent Application Laid 
Open) 1990-304515 is known as the auto focussing 
technology for the optical scanning device. According 
to the art disclosed in
