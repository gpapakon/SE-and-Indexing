<ABSTRACT>
A cell material structure (10) for confinement of concrete 
and earth material, having a plurality of plastic strips (14) 

bonded together on their faces in a side by side 
relationship at bonding areas (16) which are staggered from 

strip to strip such that the plurality of strips (14) may be 
stretched in a direction perpendicular to the faces of the 

strips (14) to form a web of cells (20), the strips (14) forming cell 
walls (18). At least one of the strips (14) has an aperture (34) through 

which a reinforcing member (12) extends. Preferably, the 
reinforcing member is a tendon (12) made of a polymer having a 

nominal breaking strength of from about 100 to about 2,500 lb.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a reinforced cell 
material for confinement of concrete and earth materials. 
Specifically, the present invention relates to a cell web 
material which is reinforced with tendons to prevent 
unwanted displacement of the web material during 
installation and operation. EP-A-0 378 309 discloses an earth confinement material having vent 
openings between adjacent cells, which provides improved 
structural integrity in single layer and multilayer filled cell 
structures and allows venting of the water and entrapped gases 
from certain fill materials. 
According to EP-A-0 
378 309 cables 100 and 200, as shown in figures 8 and 9 pass 
through vent openings 12. The cables 100 and 200 are loosely 
threaded through the vent openings 12 and are used to sew adjacent 
sections of the cell confinement structure together. The cables 
100 and 200 therefore serve as place holders which prevent 
shifting of the cell confinement structure. As shown in figure 9 
each of the cables 100 and 200 proceeds along a zigzag course 
since the adjacent ones of the vent openings 12 are not 
substantially coincident.  
 Cellular confinement systems serve to increase the 
load bearing capacity, stability and erosion resistance of 
materials which are placed within the cells of the system. 
A commercially available system is Geoweb® plastic web soil 
confinement system, sold by Presto Products, Incorporated, 
P.O. Box 2399, Appleton, Wis. 54913. Geoweb® cells are 
made from high density polyethylene strips which are joined 
by ultrasonic seams on their faces in a side by side 
relationship at alternating spacings so that when the 
strips are stretched out in a direction perpendicular to 
the faces of the strips, the resulting web section is 
honeycomb-like in appearance, with sinusoidal or undulant 
shaped cells. Geoweb® sections are light-weight and are 
shipped in their collapsed form for ease in handling and 
installation. The web materials have been used extensively to 
provide road bases, subgrades or pavement systems. 
Structural foundations have been reinforced or stiffened 
with the web materials. Additionally, Geoweb® cells have 
been used to provide earth and liquid retention structures 
by stacking one web layer upon another, such as a stepped 
back design for hill slope retention. The Geoweb® cells 
also protect earth slopes, channels, revetments and 
hydraulic structures from surface erosion. Grass and other 
earth slope cover materials have been protected and 
stabilized through the use of
