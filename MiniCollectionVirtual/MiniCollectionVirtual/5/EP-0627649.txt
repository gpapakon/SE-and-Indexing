<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus and method of manufacturing a wavelength 
converter of an optical fiber type, having a core (41) and a 

clad (4) covering the core. At least one of the core and clad 
is made of nonlinear optical material such that copious 

amounts of second harmonic light are emitted from a light 
emitting end face of the optical fiber. Grooves (69) and/or 

flanges (70) are formed in or on a transparent layer covering 
the clad. The transparent layer also covers the light 

emitting end face of the optical fiber. A collimating 
surface is formed on the transparent layer at the light 

emitting end face for collimating the second harmonic 
light emitted.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a wavelength 
converter which generates from an incident laser 
light beam a second harmonic of the laser light beam, and 
is easily positioned within a light source device and/or 
outputs the second harmonic laser light as parallel rays. Second harmonics of laser light occur in a medium 
due to the nonlinear optical effect. This phenomenon 
causes the generation of second harmonics when the 
polarization of laser light incident on a medium is 
proportional to the second and higher degrees of the 
electric field of the incident laser light. Materials in which the nonlinear optical effect 
occurs are called nonlinear optical materials. The 
inorganic materials KH₂PO₄ and LiNbO₃ are currently used  
 
nonlinear optical materials. Organic material 2-methyl-4-nitrileanilin 
(MNA) has attracted some attention as a 
nonlinear optical material because it has a superb 
nonlinear optical constant. Typical wavelength converter confine the 
fundamental component (i.e. incident laser light) using 
high energy density nonlinear optical materials, wherein 
the interaction of the harmonic components and the 
fundamental components is elongated. For this reason, 
an optical wave guide type of wavelength converter 
is used. This type of wavelength converter has a 
narrow wave guide, within which light propagates, formed 
on a substrate; and the wave guide and substrate are 
covered with an overlayer. In order to produce copious 
amounts of second harmonic light, the optical wave guide 
must accept a phase propagating velocity of the second 
harmonic. In other words, the fundamental component must 
phase match the second harmonic component. The simplest 
method known for obtaining this phase match is based on 
Cerenkov radiation. The Cerenkov method of phase matching follows. 
Shown in FIGURE 1 (PRIOR ART), a second harmonic light is 
generated from light propagating through an optical guide 
portion 121 at point A. The second harmonic light 
propagates at and angle α, with respect to the optical 
axis of the optical guide portion 121, towards a 
substrate 122 and an overlayer 123. After a 
predetermined time period, the second harmonic light is  
 
generated at point B as generated at point A. If the 
equiphase plane of the second harmonic light generated at 
point A is coincident with that of the second harmonic 
light generated at point B, then the second harmonic 
light is emitted. The emission of the second harmonic 
light is in the direction of angle α. If the following
