<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tabular grain light-sensitive 
silver halide emulsion having high sensitivity, 
graininess and preservability. Further, the present invention 
relates to a silver halide photographic light-sensitive 
material having high sensitivity, graininess and 
preservability. Giving a high sensitivity to a light-sensitive silver 
halide emulsion is the most useful means to improve a 
photographic light-sensitive material in various properties. 
For example, high-sensitivity color photographic light-sensitive 
materials used in recent years are developed by 
raising the sensitivity of an emulsion. And, with respect to 
image quality, it is widely known that graininess can be 
improved by use of a silver halide comprising small grains 
having a high sensitivity. Further, in the manufacture of X-ray  
 
photographic light-sensitive materials, a technique for 
raising the sensitivity of a light-sensitive silver halide 
emulsion is indispensable in maintaining high sensitivity and, 
concurrently, in providing high sharpness by reducing the 
amount of crossover light. Accordingly, there have so far 
been made a variety studies to raise the sensitivity of light-sensitive 
silver halide emulsions. Especially, techniques for raising the sensitivity using 
tabular silver halide grains were often disclosed in recent 
years, examples of which can be seen in Japanese Pat. O.P.I. 
Pub. Nos. 111935/1983, 111936/1983, 111937/1983, 113927/1983 
and 99433/1984. Since these tabular silver halide grains have surface 
areas larger than those of the so-called regular silver halide 
grains including hexahedral and octahedral grains when 
compared in equal volumes, these can adsorb larger amounts of 
sensitizing dyes on their surfaces and, thereby, have an 
advantage of being highly sensitive. Further, Japanese Pat. O.P.I. Pub. No. 92942/1988 
discloses a technique to provide a high silver iodide content 
core inside of a tabular silver halide grain, and Japanese 
Pat. O.P.I. Pub. No. 151618/1988 discloses a technique to use 
hexagonal tabular silver halide grains, both of which are 
effective in providing high sensitivities. In addition, 
Japanese Pat. O.P.I. Pub. Nos. 106746/1988, 183644/1989 and  
 
279237/1989 disclose techniques concerning the composition 
distribution of tabular silver halide grains. With respect to the crystal structure of tabular silver 
halide grains, there have been disclosed several techniques 
which relate to parallel twin planes. Japanese Pat. O.P.I.
