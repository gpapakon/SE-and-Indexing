<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to cooling mechanisms and, more 
particularly, to an apparatus for containing and cooling an integrated 
circuit device. It is well known that the performance of some electronic 
devices can be improved by cooling them to a low temperature, and 
even to a temperature below 0Â° C. As a result, a variety of devices 
have been designed to cool integrated circuit devices. For example, 
U.S. Patent No. 4,730,665 discloses an apparatus for cooling a 
high-density integrated circuit device. This apparatus includes a 
housing in which the circuit device is sealingly mounted in an 
internal chamber of the housing. The chamber is at least partially 
filled with a plurality of thermally conductive spheroids which are 
biased into thermally conductive contact with each other and with 
the integrated circuit device to maximise the heat exchange surface. 
This apparatus further includes an inlet and an outlet for passing a 
dielectric immersion coolant through the chamber in direct heat 
exchange relationship with the spheroids and with the high-density 
integrated circuit device. Another example is shown in U.S. Patent 
4,758,926 which describes a device for enclosing, protecting and 
cooling semiconductor integrated circuit chips. The device includes 
a generally planar substrate with the chips positioned thereon. 
Signal connections are provided between at least some of the chips. 
A heat sink is positioned in contact with the chips and includes 
microchannels through which a cooling fluid flows for purposes of 
transferring heat generated by the chips to such fluid. Manifolds are 
provided to direct the fluid to and from the microchannels, and  
 
microcapillary slots may be formed on the heat sink surface adjacent 
the chips to receive liquid to generate attractive forces between the 
heat sink and chips to facilitate heat transfer. Circuitry is provided 
to distribute power through the device and to the chips. Yet another 
example is shown in U.S. Patent No. 5,032,897 which discloses a 
thermoelectrically cooled integrated circuit package which includes 
an insulative module which defines a cavity. A thermoelectric cooler 
is positioned within the cavity, and an integrated circuit chip is 
connected to the thermoelectric cooler. However, a problem which may be encountered with the 
aforementioned devices is the formation of frost on the surface 
thereof during low temperature operation. Such problem may result 
in water developing on the printed circuit board which may cause 
structu
