<ABSTRACT>
Pourable fluid aqueous cleaning agent concentrates contain surface-active agents and a water-soluble salt. The water-soluble salt consists of at least 50, preferably 50 to 65 % by weight sodium bicarbonate with an average grain size of about 200 +/- 100  mu m and the surface-active agents consist of a weakly foaming mixture of alkyl sulphates and/or alkyl ether sulphates and alkyl polyglycol ethers with narrow homologue distribution and soap.

<CLAIMS>
Pourable, liquid water-based cleaning concentrates containing 
surfactants and a water-soluble salt, characterized in that they contain 


a) at least 50 and preferably 50 to 65% by weight of sodium bicarbonate 
with a mean particle size of around 200 ± 100 µm as the water-soluble 

salt and 
b) 2 to 30 and preferably 3 to 15% by weight of a low-foaming surfactant 
mixture of alkyl sulfates and/or alkyl ether sulfates and narrow-range 

alkyl polyglycol ethers and soap, 
 
the quantities being based on the formulation as a whole. 
Cleaning concentrates as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that they 
contain 0 to 13% and preferably 4 to 10% by weight of C
8-22
 and preferably 
C
10-18
 alkyl sulfates as the alkyl sulfates. 
Cleaning concentrates as claimed in claims 1 and 2, characterized in 
that they contain 0 to 13 and preferably 4 to 10% by weight of alkyl ether 

sulfates containing a C
8-18
 and preferably C
10-18
 alkyl radical and 1 to 5 and 
preferably 2 to 4 moles of ethylene oxide in the molecule as the alkyl ether 

sulfates. 
Cleaning concentrates as claimed in claims 1 to 3, characterized in 
that they contain 1.5 to 8 and preferably 2 to 6% by weight of one or more 

narrow-range alkyl polyglycol ethers containing a C
8-18
 alkyl radical and 2 to 
8 moles of ethylene oxide in the molecule. 
Cleaning concentrates as claimed in claims 1 to 4, characterized in 
that they contain 0.05 to 5 and preferably 0.5 to 3% by weight of one or more 

carboxylic acids containing a linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated 
C
7-22
 and preferably C
16-22
 alkyl radical as the soap, the carboxylic acids 
optionally being completely or partly present in salt form, preferably as alkali  

 
metal, ammonium or alkyl ammonium salts. 
Cleaning concentrates as claimed in claims 1 to 5, characterized in 
that they additionally contain up to 5% by weight of polyols. 
Cleaning concentrates as claimed in claims 1 to 6, characterized in 
that they additionally contain 0 to 2 and preferably about 0.1 to 1.8% by 

weight of polymers. 
Cleaning concentrates as claimed in claims 1 to 7, characterized in 
that they additionally contain ingredients typical of cleaning compositions, 

such as perfume oils, organic or inorganic builders, solubilizers, preservatives 
and/or other antimicrobially active compounds and also dyes.
