<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a combination well logging device adapted to
be moved inside a borehole to measure the properties of geological
formations through which the borehole passes.It is customary to effect logging measurements in oil boreholes, in
order to locate hydrocarbon reservoirs in the geological formations
through which the borehole passes and to evaluate their potential. In
order to do this, several different types of logging are needed, their
results being combined. One assembly which is used conventionally is
called a "triple combo" in the jargon of oil technicians. It comprises
a neutron emission sonde sensitive to the hydrogen content of the
formations (for example the CNT tool of Schlumberger) and a gamma-gamma
sonde sensitive to the density of the formations (for example the LDT
tool of Schlumberger), whose results are combined in order to derive an
indication of the porosity of the formations, and a resistivity sonde
such as an induction sonde (DIT tool of Schlumberger) or an electrode
sonde of Laterolog type (DLT tool of Schlumberger) which allows water
saturation Sw to be determined. Furthermore a sonde for measuring
natural gamma radiation is added to this assembly (such as the SGT tool
of Schlumberger), which is representative of the presence of clays.
Finally the tool string includes a telemetry cartridge at its upper end
(for example the CTS or DTS cartridge of Schlumberger) providing the
interface between the measuring sondes and the electric cable. In the
case in which the device comprises a sonde of Laterolog type, it is
also customary to include a so-called micro-resistivity sonde (MSFL
tool of Schlumberger), which provides better vertical resolution than
the abovementioned resistivity sondes and a smaller depth of
investigation.In conventional manner, the above-described range of measurements
is obtained in a single lowering operation down the borehole, by means
of a tool string formed from various types of sonde attached end to end 
(for example formed from the tools CNT/SGT/DIT/LDT). The assembly
which is thus formed has a length in the order of 20 meters and
requires a large number of connections. This requires special care in
assembly, and installation at the site of the borehole is made tricky.
It also has to be noted that the greater the length of the tool string,
the greater the length of the end section of the borehole which cannot
be subjected to measurement by the sondes located high in the tool
string, because the lower end of the tool string is resting on the
bottom
