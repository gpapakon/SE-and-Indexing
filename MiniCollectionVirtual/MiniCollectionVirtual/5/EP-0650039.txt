<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pyroelectric type infrared
sensor for detecting infrared rays over a wide range by a
pyroelectric element.Recently, pyroelectric type infrared sensors have been used for
measuring temperatures of cooking stuff in microwave ovens,
controlling room temperature by air conditioners, person detecting
in auto-doors or alarm devices, and the like by utilizing the
feature that the pyroelectric type infrared sensors can detect
temperature or things without contact, and it is seen that the
field of the application will be expanded.A pyroelectric type infrared sensor is utilizing pyroelectric
effect of a lithium tantalate (LiTaO3) single crystal and the
like. A pyroelectric substance has a self polarization
characteristics, so surface charges are always generated, but
the surface charges combine with the charges in the atmosphere to
keep electrically neutral state in stationary condition. Once
infrared rays incident, the temperature of the pyroelectric
substance is changed, accordingly the neutral of the charge state 
on the surface is destroyed and changed. At that time, the charge
generated on the surface is detected to measure the amount of the
incident infrared rays, this is the pyroelectric type infrared
sensor. Generally, substances emit infrared rays according to
their temperatures, the existence or the temperature of the
objects can be detected by using the pyroelectric type infrared
sensor.So far, this kind of conventional pyroelectric type infrared
sensors is structured as shown in Fig. 20. The structure will be
described hereinafter.Fig 20 is a sectional view showing a constitution of a
conventional pyroelectric type infrared sensor. A pyroelectric
element 21 is formed of ceramics and detects infrared rays. A
seal tube 22 covers the pyroelectric element 21 to protect it from
disturbance light and electromagnetic noise. An incident infrared
ray filter 24 is installed at the opening 23 of the seal tube 22.
An external lens 25 is placed outside of the seal tube 22, and
focuses or images the infrared rays 26 emitted from the object
onto the pyroelectric element 21 onto the pyroelectric element 21.
An external lens 25 is a refraction type fresnel lens formed of
polyethylene resin utilizing refraction action of light. The depth
T of each of the recessed slots of the fresnel lens is increased
as the position of the recessed slot moves outwardly so that the
declining angle of the slot becomes larger, the light is refracted
at the oblique surface of the recessed slot and
