<ABSTRACT>
A steerable stylet and manipulative handle assembly especially adapted for guiding the introduction of an endocardial pacing or cardioversion/defibrillation lead or a catheter to a desired location in a patient's cardiovascular system. The steerable stylet or catheter designed to be introduced into the lumen of a lead comprises an outer, elongated tubular member, a traction element or pull wire extending generally through the length of the tubular member and within its lumen except for a predetermined distance in the distal portion thereof, and a manipulative handle coupled to the proximal ends of the tubular member and wire which may be employed with one hand to both rotate the tubular member and impart a continuously variable curve in the distal portion thereof. The distal portion of the tubular member is especially configured to be either attached to or cooperate with the distal end of the pull wire so that proximally-directed traction applied by the handle to the wire causes the distal portion of the tubular member to bend. The distal portion of the tubular member is provided with openings to allow the wire to exit and re-enter the lumen of the tubular member in the distal portion so that traction applied to the wire bows the tubular member into a curve of desired radius.

<DESCRIPTION>
Field of the Invention--The present invention relates 
to a wire guide or stylet assembly for the introduction of 
medical catheters or electrical leads to a desired site 
within the patient's body, and specifically to a steerable 
stylet assembly for imparting a desired dynamic curvature in 
the distal portion of a catheter or lead during its 
introduction in order to guide it through curvature in the 
patient's vascular system and to a desired site in the 
patient's cardiovascular system. Description of the Prior Art--The marked advances in 
cardiac and vascular surgery in the past few years and other 
medical problems that require diagnostic study of the 
vascular beds and systems as well as the advances in pacing 
and cardio version, has led to the extensive use of cardiac 
or vascular catheters, such as percutaneous transluminal 
coronary angioplasty (PTCA) catheters and transvenous or 
endocardial pacing and cardioversion leads. The insertion 
of a relatively long catheter or lead body to an internal 
site requires advancement of the catheter or lead into 
branch vessels at varying angles relative to the feeding 
direction of the catheter or a lead. In respect to the introduction of PTCA catheters, for 
example, several techniques for introducing such catheters 
are available, including the cut-down method and the 
Seldinger techniques. The Seldinger technique involves 
surgically opening a vein or artery with a needle, inserting 
a guide wire into the vein or artery through the lumen of 
the needle, withdrawing the needle, inserting over the guide 
wire a dilator located inside an associated hemostasis valve 
and sheath, removing the dilator and inserting a catheter 
through the hemostasis value and sheath into the blood 
vessel. In this procedure, flexible spring wire guides of  
 
the type disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. Patent No. 
4,815,478 to Buchbinder, et al, and the numerous patents 
referenced therein are steered to the desired internal site 
by remotely deflecting the tip of the guide to facilitate 
movement of the guide wire around or through a curved path 
in the vessel. The steerable spring guide wire of the 478 
patent possesses a flexible tip constructed with flexible 
spring coil wire extending from the elongated guide wire 
body and coupled to a long tip which is additionally coupled 
to a deflection wire extending through the flexible tubing 
body and the spring coil as well as a control wire extending 
through the lumen provide for the deflection of the distal 
tip portion

<CLAIMS>
A stylet and manipulative handle assembly for 
insertion into the proximal opening in the lumen of a hollow 

elongated catheter or lead body for imparting a curvature in 
a portion thereof and enabling the rotation thereof by 

manipulation of the handle at the proximal end of the 
elongated catheter or lead body, said stylet assembly 

comprising:
 
   a two piece stylet adapted to be inserted into 

said proximal opening and through the length of said 
lumen, said stylet comprising;
 
   an elongated hollow tubular member (10) having 

proximal and distal ends and portions (14, 16);
 
   a length of pull wire extending within the tubular 

member (10) through a proximal opening therein;
 
   means (39) for engaging the distal end of said 

pull wire (12) with the distal end (22) of said tubular 
member (10), so that traction applied proximally on 

said pull wire (12) tends to induce a curvature in said 
tubular member (10); and
 
   manipulative handle means (28) coupled to the 

proximal end of said tubular member (10) and receiving 
said pull wire (12) further comprising means for  

 
applying traction to said pull wire (12) in said 

proximal direction to induce a curvature in said hollow 
tubular member (10) and in the adjacent elongated 

catheter or lead body;
 
   characterized in that said elongated hollow 

tubular member (10) has at least one opening (18) in 
the side thereof and said pull wire (12) extending 

within the tubular member further extends through said 
side opening (18) and outside the tubular member for a 

predetermined distance, a portion of said tubular 
member extending along said predetermined distance 

being compressed upon itself such that said tubular 
member is flattened (11) only along the side adjacent 

said pull wire, said pull wire extending to the distal 
end (22) of said tubular member (10). 
The assembly of Claim 1 wherein said tubular 
member (10) further comprises:
 
   a second side opening (20) adjacent to the distal 

tip (22) thereof and located said predetermined 
distance from said first opening (18) and wherein:
 
   said pull wire (12) extending outside said distal 

portion (16) of said tubular member (10) is threaded 
into said second opening (20) and;
 
   said engaging means (23) is adapted to 

mechanically couple the distal ends of said pull wire 
(12) and said tubular member (10) together.  

 
The assembly of Claim 1 or claim 2 wherein a 
portion of said pull wire (12) extending along said 

predetermined distance co-operatively bears against the 
adjoining inner surface of said catheter or lead body and 

assumes the curvature of said bowed outward tubular member 
to thereby induce a curvature in said distal portion (16) of 

said catheter or lead body. 
The style assembly of Claim 1 or claim 2 or claim 
3 wherein said manipulative handle (28) means further 

comprises:
 
   an elongated tubular housing (30) having a necked 

down portion (38) with an axially disposed opening in 
said necked down portion for receiving said proximal 

end of said elongated tubular member and the proximal 
portion of said pull wire (10) of said stylet therein;
 
   a thumb actuable slideable member (40) disposed 

around at least a portion of the length of said tubular 
housing (30);
 
   moveable lever means (34) having a predetermined 

length adapted to being pivotally coupled at one end to 
said housing (30) and at the other end to said 

slideable member (40); and
