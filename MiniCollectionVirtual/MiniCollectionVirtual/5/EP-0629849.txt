<ABSTRACT>
Method for measuring the proportion of non-condensible gases, especially in the sterilisation steam of a steriliser, the decrease in the weight of a liquid column, which is proportional to the length of the gas bubbles contained in a rising tube and displacing the liquid, being used as measuring parameter.

<CLAIMS>
A method for measuring the portion of non-condensible gases and vapours,
in particular in the sterilisation vapour of a sterilizing apparatus, wherein

during the course of the process a part of the vapour-gas-mixture is drawn
off from the vapour system, condensed in a condenser and conducted into a

measuring system, 
characterized
 in that the difference in pressure between
a fluid column consisting of condensate and non-condensible gases and

being occluded in an ascending pipe (6) and the pressure of a condensate
column without gas having the same height is measured.
A method according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the condensation
conduit and the measuring conduit formed as ascending pipe (6) are chosen

as narrow in cross-section that the Stokes' buoyancy takes effect only
weakly and therefore the bubbles of the non-condensible gases can only

ascend so slow that the uniformity of the measuring signal can not be

distorted.
A method according to claim 2, 
characterized
 in that a comparison conduit
(8) also formed as ascending pipe and having a wide cross-section is

arranged in parallel to the measuring conduit formed as ascending pipe (6)
and having a narrow cross-section and that the difference in pressure

between the lower end of the measuring conduit (6) and the lower end of the
comparison conduit (8) is measured by means of a connected differential

pressure gauge.
A method according to claim 3, 
characterized
 in that the measuring conduit
(6) leads into the comparison conduit (8) at the upper end thereof so that the

condensate flowing out of the measuring conduit (6) first flows into the
comparison conduit (8), fills it up and keeps it constantly filled and

afterwards flows into the open via an overflow.
A method according to any one of the claims 1 to 4, 
characterized
 in that a
temperature compensation via a temperature measurement is provided. 
A method according to any one of the claims 1 to 5, 
characterized
 in that a
compensation of the ambient pressure is provided.
