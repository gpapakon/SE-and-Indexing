<ABSTRACT>
YMCK halftone dot percentage data from an image 
editor 12 are converted into color image data in an XYZ 

colorimetric system with a common color space conversion 
table generated by a common color space conversion table 

generator 20. The color image data are converted into a 
gamut mapping and appearance corresponding to an image 

monitor device 14A with a gamut mapping/appearance table 
generated by a gamut mapping/appearance generator 22. Then, 

the color image data are converted into color image data in 
a device color space of an image output unit 14A with a 

device color space conversion table generated by a device 
color space conversion table generator 24 for thereby 

predicting a color image which will be reproduced by the 
image output unit 14B. Alternatively, the YMCK halftone dot 

percentage data from the image editor 12 may be corrected 
using dot gain correcting coefficients established 

respectively for tristimulus values X, Y, Z, and then 
converted into color image data in the XYZ color space with 

a common color space conversion table.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of and a
system for predicting a reproduced color image by
establishing a color space data conversion formula with
printing conditions such as print paper, ink, etc. used as
parameters, converting color image data into color space
data for an image monitor device according to the
established color space data conversion formula, and
outputting the color space data to make it possible to
predict colors easily and highly accurately.
Description of the Related Art:In recent years, there have widely been used color
printing systems for reading a color image from an original
document such as a photograph, a paint, or the like or
processing color image data supplied from an image input
device and either outputting a color image as a hard copy
from a printer, or printing a color image with a press
plate. It is desirable to be able to display a color image
of reproduced color tones on a cathode-ray tube (CRT) or the
like irrespective of different output mediums and processing
steps.A printed material is produced according to a
number of processing steps. More specifically, color
separation films of Y, M, C, K are generated on the basis of 
color image data supplied from an image input device, and
presensitized plates are exposed to color images through the
color separation films. Then, the color images on the
presensitized plates are developed, and the presensitized
plates are set on a printing press to produce a printed
material. The colors on the printed material which are
finally produced depend on various printing conditions
including the paper, inks, and water used, the type of the
printing press, and the screen ruling and dot shape which
are employed for the formation of dot-matrix images.In the field of printing industry which requires
the above complex processing steps and conditions, there has
been a demand for a predicting system which displays color
image data processed as desired on a CRT, a color printer,
or the like for the operator to confirm the final image
quality of a printing material displayed on the CRT or the
like with high accuracy.One prior art system which meets the above demand
is a system disclosed in U.S. patent No. US-A-4,500,919. The
disclosed system comprises means for determining tristimulus
appearance signals, which are of a common color data format,
from a colored original document, means for effecting
aesthetic correction on the tristimulus appearance signals,
means for displaying a corrected color image based on the
corrected
