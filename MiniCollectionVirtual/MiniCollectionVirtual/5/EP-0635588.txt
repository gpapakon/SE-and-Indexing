<ABSTRACT>
In an improved Czochralski process for growing 
silicon crystals, wherein a single-crystal silicon 

seed is pulled from a molten silicon source to 
grow the crystal therefrom, a pre-oxidized arsenic 

dopant is added to the molten silicon source to 
alter an electrical property of the grown crystal. 

The pre-oxidized arsenic dopant includes granular 
particles of metallic arsenic having a surface 

film of arsenic oxide, the surface film having a 
thickness of ten microns to one millimeter. After 

doping, the molten silicon source is moved from 
the grown crystal, and an applied temperature is 

increased to burn excess pre-oxidized dopant.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to semiconductor processing,
particularly to techniques for growing silicon crystal.Single-crystal silicon is used commonly as the
starting material for fabricating integrated circuits. A
typical technique for producing single-crystal silicon is the
so-called Czochralski process, whereby a small single-crystal
seed is dipped into molten silicon and slowly withdrawn,
typically while simultaneously rotating the crystal. In this
way, the single crystal is grown into a larger silicon crystal
or boule.To produce high-quality silicon crystals, certain
conditions that affect crystal growth are carefully
controlled, such as temperature, pressure, impurities, and
pull rate. In addition, certain impurities may be
intentionally introduced into the molten silicon, as
"dopants," to alter the electrical characteristics of the
resulting crystal. But sometimes, impurities unintentionally
contaminate the molten silicon such that crystal growth is
disrupted, typically by the impurities precipitating at
interstitial or vacant sites, thereby stressing the crystal 
lattice.Accordingly, there is a need to improve conventional Czochralski processing by
reducing disruption of crystal growth caused by impurities.CS-A-252327 [Chemical Abstracts, Vol. 110, No. 6, page 730, Abstract No. 49759h]
discloses a glass crystalline non-alkaline material with a high content of arsenic which contains
10 to 35% As2O5, 15 to 50% of MgO, CaO, SrO, BaO or a mixture of two or more thereof,
10 to 35% SiO2 and 5 to 25% of Al2O3, La2O3, CeO2, or a mixture of two or more thereof,
Optional ingredients include 0.2 to 15% TiO2 and/or ZrO2. It is disclosed how sheets are cut
from this material and are placed alternately between sheets of monocrystalline silicon which
are then placed together into an electric furnace where thermal processing in a controlled
atmosphere is carried out. During this thermal processing which can take place up to 110 to
1200°C As is released from the dopant sheet and is transferred to the silicon monocrystal
which also acquires semiconductive properties.The invention resides in improving a Czochralski process for growing a silicon crystal,
particularly by adding a pre-oxidized arsenic dopant to a molten silicon source. The arsenic
dopant comprises either metallic arsenic or a metallic arsenic and silicon compound and is
prepared with a film of surface oxide. The surface film has a preferred thickness ranging from
10 microns to 1 millimeter. Excess pre-oxidized dopant may be burnt off by moving the
molten
