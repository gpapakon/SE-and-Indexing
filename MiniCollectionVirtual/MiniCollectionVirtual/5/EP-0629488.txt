<ABSTRACT>
Method of heating by emission of electromagnetic radiation, characterised in that at least one emitting source (1), extending in the form of a resistive element (2) matching as closely as possible the geometry constituted by the joint lines (5, 6) of the thermoplastic components (7, 8) to be assembled, is arranged with a reflecting zone (12) which is also shaped to the profile of the resistive element, then a source of energy, such as, in particular, an electric current, is caused to flow inside the said emitting source (1) so as to cause, by the Joule effect and by the focussing of the released radiation onto the reflecting surfaces (12) which are possibly coated with a metallic film (16), the melting of a surface layer of material at the interface of the said components, and the radiating source is moved back into a position which does not interfere with the joining of the components.

Process for the fusion of thermoplastics components by
emission of an electromagnetic radiation focused onto the

joint lines of the components, characterized in that

at least one emitter source (1) is available,
extending in the form of a resistant element (2) and

following very closely the three-dimensional geometry of
the joint line zones (5, 6) of th
e thermoplastic
components (7, 8), with focusing of the energy emitted

onto these lines (5, 6) by means of a reflecting element
(12), optionally coated with a metallic film (16), or of

a tube (4), the zones of the resistant element (1)
situated outside the focusing zone being provided with a

discontinuity of section, in such a way as to reduce the
temperature of the resistant element (2) in these zones

while maintaining electrical continuity;
then the passage of an energy source such as, notably,
an electric current, through the inside of said emitter

source (1) is made to produce losses by Joule effect,
characterized by a considerable increase in the

temperature leading to the creation of electromagnetic
waves, notably of the infrared type, which focus on the

joint lines (5, 6), causing the melting of a surface
layer of material at the interface between said

components,
and that the removal is then carried out of the
radiation source into a position that does not interfere

with the joining together of the components for the
purpose of assembling them.
Process for the fusion of thermoplastic components
according to claim 1, characterized in that a copy of the

exact profile of the joint lines (5, 6) for the
thermoplastic components (7, 8) to be joined together is

created by a series of machinings in a material notably 
based upon a polymer resin for the purpose of producing a

recess, the profile of which is identical to that of the
reflecting zone (12) of said emitter source (1), then

said recess is filled with an alloy having a melting
point lying in the range 50-200Â°C and, after

solidification of said alloy, there is projected onto the
free surface of the recess a film (16) of small

thickness, notably based upon nickel, then there are
formed, within the body of said alloy, a plurality of

slits at the level only of the emission zones, for the
passage of a resistant strip (3) or wire (2), the

assembly being stiffened by a coating or integration into
a layer (14, 15) of refractory material, the latter

operation consisting of placing the solidified sandwich
in an environment having a temperature slightly greater

than the melting temperature of the alloy.
Process for the fusion of thermoplastic components
according to one of claims 1 or 2, characterized in that

a copy of the exact profile of the joint lines (5, 6) of
the thermoplastic components (7, 8) to be joined together

is created by the prior deposition onto the latter of a
flexible cord (11) of elastomer, said cord being

afterwards imprisoned on the free surfaces of a plurality
of layers (14, 15) of material and refractory binder

comprising, at their centre, a metal core (13) after
solidification of the sandwich, and that the removal of

said cord (11) and its replacement in location and
position by a plurality of emitter sources (1) are then

carried out.
Installation for carrying out the process of fusing
together thermoplastic components according to any one of

the preceding claims, characterized in that the
installation comprises at least one emitter source (1) 

extending in the form of a resistant element (2) and
fitting as closely as possible, on the one hand, to a

plurality of reflecting zones (12) and, on the other
hand, to the geometry constituted of the joint lines (5,

6) of the thermoplastic components (7, 8) to be assembled
together, an energy source such as, notably, an electric

current supplying said emitter source (1) for the purpose
of creating by Joule effect a temperature increase of

said source until electromagnetic waves are created,
notably of the infrared type, which cause the melting of

a surface layer of material at the interface between said
components, said emitter source (1) being firmly

connected to the reflector (12) by means of a plurality
of lugs (17) or by a partial embedding within the

refractory layer (14, 15).
Installation for the fusion together of thermoplastic
components according to claim 4, characterized in that it

comprises, opposite the joint lines (5, 6) of the
thermoplastic components (7, 8), a unitary emitter source

(1).
Installation for the fusion together of thermoplastic
components according to claim 4, characterized in that it

comprises, opposite the joint lines (5, 6) of the
thermoplastic components (7, 8), a double emitter source

(1).
Installation for the fusion together of thermoplastic
components according to any one of claims 4 to 6,

characterized in that the emitter source (1) is enclosed
within a tube (4) containing gas, optionally circulating

within a plurality of openings (9), for the purpose of
causing the melting of a surface layer of material by a

combination of radiant and convective transfers. 
Installation for the fusion together of thermoplastic
components according to any one of claims 4 to 7,

characterized in that the emitter source (1) is coated
with a material (19) having high thermal conductivity.
Installation for the fusion together of thermoplastic
components according to any one of claims 4 to 8,

characterized in that the emitter source (1) is
constituted of a spirally wound resistant filament (2)

coiled or folded to concertina shape in the case of a
strip (3), notably chosen from among the filaments based

upon tungsten, nickel, chromium, iron, aluminium.
Installation for the fusion together of thermoplastic
components according to any one of claims 4 to 9,

characterized in that the reflecting power of the
internal, external or embedded zones is increased by

vapour deposition of a thin metallic film (16) having a
high reflective index such as, notably, a metallic alloy

based upon nickel, silver, copper, said alloy having in
addition properties of very low thermal conductivity but

an excellent reflective index and the highest possible
melting point.
