<ABSTRACT>
A hand tool or clamp (10) which locks itself to a 
workpiece (8) to thereby free the hands of the user, 

includes a fixed jaw (12) secured to one end of a slide bar 
(14) and a movable jaw (16) mounted on the slide bar (14) 

for movement there-along towards and away from the fixed 
jaw (12). The movable jaw (16) is normally spring biased 

toward the fixed jaw (12) by a flat coil spring (46) 
supported on the fixed jaw (12) and connected at its free 

end (46a) to the movable jaw (16). The spring (46) is 
uncoiled as the jaws (12, 16) are pulled apart to receive 

a workpiece (8), and when either jaw (12, 16) is released, 
re-winds and rapidly advances the movable jaw (16) along 

the slide bar (14) into clamping engagement with the 
workpiece (8). Additional clamping pressure is provided by 

a screw mechanism (60) associated with the movable jaw (16) 
which co-operates with the slide bar (14) to advance the 

movable jaw (16) towards the fixed jaw (12) and increase 
the clamping pressure between them.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to bar clamps
of the type used to temporarily clamp two articles
together, for example, for gluing, or to hold a workpiece
for welding or other operation, and more particularly
to a quick-action bar clamp wherein the moving
jaw can be rapidly moved to accommodate a workpiece.Bar clamps of the various configurations are
old and well-known. A relatively recent entry into
the prior art is the quick-action bar clamp disclosed
in U.S. Patents Nos. 4,926,722 and 5,005,449 and
marketed by Peterson Manufacturing Co., Inc. as its
"Quick-Grip" clamp. The clamp has a movable jaw which
is rapidly movable over both short and long distances
to clamp against a workpiece, and is operable with one
hand. The movable jaw is connected to one end of a
movable slide bar and a stationary jaw is supported on
the slide bar by a support structure including a trigger
handle grip which releasably engages the slide bar
and advances the movable jaw toward the fixed jaw.
The trigger mechanism provides a one-way drive which
normally precludes moving the slide bar and movable
jaw away from the fixed jaw; the movable jaw can be
moved in the opposite direction only when the one-way
drive mechanism is disengaged.A disadvantage in the "Quick-Grip" clamp lies
in the fact that once the jaws are initially clamped
against a work-piece the construction of the lever
mechanism is such that the hand cannot exert sufficient
force on the trigger handle to advance the
movable jaw by another increment, with the consequence 
that the clamp lacks the power to adequately clamp two
articles together.In other known forms of bar clamps the moving jaw is
entirely disengaged and free to move on one or more slide
bars until the final tightening of an object between the
movable and fixed jaws is accomplished, making its use
cumbersome and imprecise.Thus, there is a need for a bar clamp having a movable
jaw which is rapidly movable from any point on a slide bar
to clamp a workpiece against a fixed jaw and is capable of
providing large clamping forces.Document DE-A-1,301,762 discloses a bar clamp having
an elongate slide bar, a fixed jaw supported to one end of
the slide bar, and a moveable jaw supported on the slide
bar for movement towards and away from the fixed jaw.Document DE-A-2,413,816
which is considered forming the closest prior art and forming
the base of the preamble of claim 1,
discloses an extensible
tension spring which serves to draw a moveable jaw in the
direction of a fixed jaw.According to the present invention,

<CLAIMS>
A self powered quick acting clamp comprising:

an elongate hollow slide bar (14) having a U-shaped
cross section;
a fixed jaw (12) having a clamping surface (34)
secured to one end of said slide bar (14); and,
a movable jaw (16) having a clamping surface (36)
slidably mounted on said slide bar (14) for movement there-along

towards and away from said fixed jaw (12),

   characterised in that it further comprises a
partially unwound flat coil spring (46) supported at one of

said jaws (12,16) which extends interiorly of said slide
bar (14) and has a free end (46a) connected to the other of

said jaws (16,12) for normally pulling the clamping surface
(36) of said movable jaw (16) toward the clamping surface

(34) of said fixed jaw (12), wherein the tension of said
spring (46) is substantially uniform over the maximum range

of movement of said movable jaw (26) whereby upon release
of either jaw after having been pulled apart against the

tension of said spring (46) a distance sufficient to
receive a workpiece (8) said spring (46) advances said

movable jaw (16) toward said fixed jaw (12) to clamp the
workpiece (8) between their respective clamping surfaces

(34, 36) with a pressure corresponding only to the tension
of said spring (46); and,
means (60) supported on said movable jaw (16) for
releasably engaging said moveable jaw with said slide bar

(14), said means (60) being user-operated following initial
clamping of a workpiece (8) by only the tension of said

coil spring (46) and which, when operated, increases the
clamping pressure over that exerted by the tension of said

spring (46) alone.
A quick acting clamp according to claim 1, wherein
said flat coil spring (46) is supported at said fixed jaw

(12) and its said free end (46a) is connected to said
movable jaw (16). 
A quick acting clamp according to claim 1 or claim 2,
in which said means (60), when operated, tilts said movable

jaw (16) toward said fixed jaw (12), and wherein said
movable jaw (16) is pivotally supported for maintaining

parallelism between its clamping surface (36) and the
clamping surface (34) of said fixed jaw (12).
A quick acting clamp according to any preceding claim,
in which said fixed jaw (12) is secured to said one end of

said bar (14) by first support means (18); said movable jaw
(16) is mounted for movement along said bar (14) on second

support means (26); said spring (46) is mounted o a pin
passing through said first support means (18) transversely

of said slide bar (14); and, wherein the free end (46a) of
said spring (46) is connected to said second support means

(26).
A quick acting clamp according to claim 4, further
comprising a bar (42) extending transversely of a rear

portion of said second support means (26) for engaging a
top wall of said slide bar (14) when said second support

means (20) is tilted away from a clamped workpiece (8),
and means including a screw (60) threadably engaged in said

second support means which, when tightened, tilts said
second support means (26) and said movable jaw (16) toward

said clamped workpiece (8) for increasing the clamping
pressure between said fixed (12) and movable (16) jaws over

the pressure exerted by said spring (46).
