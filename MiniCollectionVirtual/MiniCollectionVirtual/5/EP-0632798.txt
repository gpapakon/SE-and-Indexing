<ABSTRACT>
A process for recovering acetic acid from a mother liquor containing acetic acid, formic acid, acetic anhydride and formic acetic anhydride comprising the steps of: (a) heating said mother liquor to a temperature greater than or equal to about 70  DEG C for a time period ranging from about 1 hour to about 24 hours to convert all of said formic acetic anhydride to acetic acid and gaseous carbon monoxide and to fully deplete either said acetic anhydride or said formic acid, whichever is initially present in a stoichiometric lesser amount and thereby produce a mixture comprising acetic acid and either acetic anhydride or formic acid, whichever has been depleted; and (b) separating said acetic acid from the remainder of said mixture produced in step (a) is provided.

 ACETIC ACID RECOVERYBackground of the Invention\5 1. Field of the InventionThe present invention relates to a process for recovering acetic acid from a mother liquor, and more particularly, to a process for recovering acetic acid from the mother liquor used in 10 the formation of N-formylaspartic anhydride.2. Description of the Prior ArtAspartame, α-L-aspartyl- -phenylalanine methyl ester, is a15 sweetening agent which is approximately 100-200 times sweeter than sucrose. As a result, aspartame has been widely used as a substitute for sucrose in beverages, foods, and the like.A number of methods have been proposed for synthesizing aspartame. One such method comprises reacting N-protected20 aspartic acid anhydride with L-phenylalanine or its methyl ester, typically in an acetic acid solvent, followed by esterification of the reaction product. This method is described in greater detail in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,933,871 and 4,810,816. As noted above, the starting material used for the aspartame synthesis25 comprises an N-protected aspartic acid anhydride, and particularly N-formylaspartic anhydride. The anhydride is typically prepared by reacting amounts of aspartic acid, formic acid and acetic anhydride. This reaction optionally takes place in the presence of co-solvents or metal catalysts. Methods30 for producing N-formylaspartic anhydride are disclosed in greater detail in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,933,871; 4,526,985; 4,550,180; and 4,810,816.The resultant mixture produced by the synthesis of N-formylaspartic anhydride comprises N-formylaspartic anhydride35 crystals in a mother liquor. In practice, the crystals may be 

separated from the mother liquor prior to reaction with the L-phenylalanine (or its methyl ester) or the L-phenylalanine may be directly added into the crystals/liquor mixture. The former 

 method is particularly advantageous as it enables higher yields of aspartame to ultimately be obtained and results in a more pure final product as the impurities which are present in the mother liquor are not transferred to the crystals.The mother liquor remaining after separation of the crystals comprises acetic acid, acetic anhydride, formic acid, formic acetic anhydride and high boiling components derived from aspartic acid, with acetic acid being present in the most predominant amount. Due to the value of acetic acid, it is desirable to recover it in relatively pure form from the mother liquor. One method for doing this comprises separating the aspartic acid derived components from the remainder of the
