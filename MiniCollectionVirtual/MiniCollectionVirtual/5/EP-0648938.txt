<ABSTRACT>
The invention makes it possible to keep the rotor of the high-pressure compressor of a turbojet engine very rigid during the operation of the latter. The inside of the rotor of the high-pressure compressor comprises compensation discs (13) inclined upstream and having no balancing weights. Centrifugal force applied to such a disc creates a loading on this disc including a radial component tending to compensate for the outward loadings which are due to the vanes, facing which vanes the compensation discs (13) are placed. The method for manufacturing such an outlet jet pipe is reduced, especially as regards the blank to be provided in order to obtain such a component. Application to all turbojet engines having compensation discs inside the rotor of their high-pressure compressor.

Turbojet engine comprising a high-pressure 
compressor rotor itself comprising a ring and an outlet 

cone (8) which are equipped with bladings and with discs 
(9, 13) inside the rotor for compensating for the centrifugal 

forces applied by the bladings to the body of the 
rotor, characterized in that some compensation discs (13) 

are conical with respect to the axis of rotation (10) of 
the rotor and have no flyweights. 
Turbojet engine according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that in the outlet cone (8) of the rotor, the 

compensation disc (13) is inclined in the upstream 
direction of the turbojet engine. 
Turbojet engine according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that it comprises a disc (9) with a flyweight 

(9A) and placed in the upstream part of the outlet cone 
(8). 
Method of manufacturing a rotor for a turbojet 
engine high-pressure compressor, comprising the following 

phases: 

forging in order to obtain forgings or blanks 
of sections of ring and of outlet cone (8) as defined in 

Claim 3, the forging, or blank of the outlet cone having 
no recesses with respect to the outer envelope of the 

outlet cone; 
friction butt-welding the various sections and 
outlet cone (8) together; and 
machining the final external shapes of the 
rotor. 
Method according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that the outlet cone is made of a nickel-based superalloy  

 
made using "Powder Metallurgy".
