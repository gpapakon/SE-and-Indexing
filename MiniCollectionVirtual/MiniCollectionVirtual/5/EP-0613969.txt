<ABSTRACT>
An automatic cop changing device for a weaving machine in which 
a shuttle carrying a cop consisting of a bobbin around which a 

weft is wound is reciprocated between warps so as to weave the 
weft between the warps, comprising: a cop positioning unit for 

securing the shuttle (2) stationary near a terminal point of its 
reciprocating movement when the weft of a current cop mounted 

on the shuttle is consumed by more than a prescribed amount; 
a cop storage unit (44) for storing a plurality of new cops; a 

robot arm (26) carrying a weft gripping hand (28) for drawing the weft 
from the current cop (19) and a weft from one of the new cops (46) 

stored in the cop storage unit, and crossing the two wefts, 
a cop engaging hand (29) for moving the cop in the shuttle between 

its upright position and its retracted position, and a cop 
gripping hand (27) for removing the old cop from the shuttle and 

carrying the new cop into the shuttle; a weft tying unit (47) for 
tying the crossed part of the wefts; and a weft trimming unit (57) 

for trimming an extraneous part of the tied weft. This 
device permits quick replacement of cops without causing undue 

strain on the weft. The advantageous use of a robot arm 
permits a compact and simple design of the entire device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for 
changing cops for a weaving machine in which a shuttle 
detachably carrying a cop consisting of a wooden bobbin 
having a weft wound thereon is reciprocated laterally 
between warps, and in particular to an automatic cop 
changing device for a weaving machine which can 
automatically carry out a series of actions including 
the action of positioning the shuttle at a prescribed 
location, the action of tying the weft of the current 
cop which has been used up by more than a prescribed 
amount with the weft of a next new cop, and the action 
of removing the current cop from the shuttle and 
mounting the next cop on the shuttle. For instance, in a paper making machine, water is 
removed from wet pulp by pressing it between a pair of 
opposing rollers, and such rollers consist of press 
felt in the form of relatively broad endless belts. 
The press felt is made by entangling fibers of a pad 
consisting of layers of woolen or synthetic fiber web 
with a ground fabric by needling. During the weaving 
process of the ground fabric, the warps are set on a 
warp beam and fed continuously while the weft is 
supplied by a cop mounted on a shuttle. Therefore, 
when weaving such a broad ground fabric for making 
press felt, the cop is required to be changed to a new 
one every time the shuttle has reciprocated from one 
lateral end to the other by a certain number of times. 
Further, at the same time, the weft of the old cop and 
the weft of the new cop must be connected with each 
other by welding or the like. Conventionally, changing cops and connecting the 
ends of two wefts together were carried out manually.  
 
As a result, an experienced operator was required for each 
weaving machine, and it was difficult to reduce the cost of 
weaving. US-A-3,608,589 discloses a structure for changing pirns in a 
weaving machine. According to this patent, the pirn is 
lifted from the shuttle by the jaws mounted on the transfer 
head which can rotate around a horizontal axial line, and is 
placed in a position above the shuttle after it is used up. 
The pirn maintains its horizontal attitude throughout this 
process. This severely restricts the placement of the means 
for storing the pirns. Further, according to this prior art publication, the wire 
extending from the used pirn and the wire extending from the 
new pirn are both drawn by transferring the pirns, and passing 
the wire through a wire knotting station as the pirns are being 
transferred. A forked lever draws the wire,

An automatic cop changing device for a weaving machine in 
which a shuttle (2) carrying a cop (19) consisting of a bobbin 

(21) around which a weft (4) is wound is reciprocated between 
warps (3) so as to weave the weft between the warps, 

comprising: 

cop positioning means (7) for keeping the shuttle 
stationary near a terminal point of its reciprocating movement 

when the weft of a current cop mounted on the shuttle is 
consumed by more than a prescribed amount; 
weft pulling means (28) for drawing the weft from the 
current cop and a weft from a new cop; 
weft tying means (47) for tying the two wefts;
