<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a moulded part made of various fractions of thermoplastic materials and also to a process and an apparatus for its manufacture. The invention is based on the object of providing a moulded part of the generic type stated at the beginning and also a process and an apparatus for its manufacture, the moulded part being composed from waste (scrap) inexpensively without additional fillers, excludes the possibility of the core region leaching out and nevertheless, as a finished product, has a surprisingly high thermal resistance to pressure, bending and acid. The moulded part comprises a shaped block which is thermoplastically heated, foamed by means of a blowing agent, compression moulded in an injection mould and subsequently deaerated and cooled by air, composed of a mixture of sorted plastics waste of the waste industry and also of fillers, in particular plastics carpet remains and/or the waste remains of sanitary products with cellulose, such as baby pants or the like, which block has a denser structure in its outer regions than in its core region.
