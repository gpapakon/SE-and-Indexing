<ABSTRACT>
Applicant has discovered that aliovalently doped gallium-indium-oxide 
(GaInO₃) can achieve electrical conductivity comparable to wide band-gap 

semiconductors presently in use while exhibiting enhanced transparency and 
improved index matching. The material can be doped to resistivity of less than 

10 milliohm-cm by small quantities of aliovalent dopants, such as tetravalent atoms. 
It has a refractive index of about 1.6 and can be deposited on glass substrates in 

polycrystalline films.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to conducting materials and, in particular, to
conducting materials comprising gallium-indium-oxide, GaInO3, doped to exhibit
electrical conductivity in a transparent state.Only a handful of materials provide the highly useful combination of
electrical conduction and optical transparency. The earliest used materials were thin
films of gold, silver and platinum used as electrodes on photoelectric cells. Wide
band-gap semiconductor transparent electrodes including tin oxide coatings came
into use during World War II (Nesa glass), and indium oxide coatings became
commercially available in the 1970's. See G. Haacke, "Transparent Conducting
Coatings", 7 Ann.Rev.Mater.Sci. 73-93 (1977).Transparent conductive materials are important components in visual
communications devices and useful in a variety of other applications. In modern
liquid crystal displays, for example, arrays of transparent electrodes define the
display segments or even pixels to be activated. Moreover transparent conductors
can be used as antistatic coatings on instrument panels, heating elements on aircraft
windows, and electrodes on solar cells. Such materials are also useful as heat
retaining and ultraviolet light-rejecting coatings on windows.One difficulty with presently available transparent conductive materials
is their narrow transmission spectrum. They tend to absorb blue light in the visible
spectrum and some tend even to absorb red light. For example, indium tin oxide,
widely used because of its high conductivity, tends to absorb blue light and, as a
consequence, appears yellow or green. Similar coloration is observed in a variety of
wide band-gap semiconductor materials including zinc indium oxide and cadmium
tin oxide. Such absorption requires higher power levels, limits choice in coloration,
and presents an impediment to the development of full color flat panel displays. A
second difficulty arises from the poor index of refraction match between indium tin
oxide (ITO) (the most commonly used transparent conductor) and typical glasses.
ITO coatings typically have an index of about 2.0 whereas typical glasses have an
index of about 1.5. The result is reflection loss at the ITO/glass interface, reducing
the amount of transmitted light. Accordingly, there is a need for transparent
conductive material having enhanced transparency and better index matching with 
glass.Applicant has discovered that aliovalently doped gallium-indium-oxide
(GaInO3) can achieve electrical conductivity comparable to wide band-gap
semic
