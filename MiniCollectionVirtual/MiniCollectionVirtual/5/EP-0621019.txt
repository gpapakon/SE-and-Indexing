<ABSTRACT>
An adjustable length prosthetic implant includes an 
implant body (22) and an axially received stem (12). The stem has a 

threaded portion (14) and an end portion (20) adapted for mounting 
with a bone. The implant body (22) includes an end portion 

adapted for mounting with a bone and a tubular sleeve (26). The 
sleeve (26) adjustably receives the stem (12). An adjustment nut is 

rotatably carried upon the sleeve (26) for threadably engaging 
the stem (12) to effect telescopic length adjustment of the stem 

relative to the sleeve. A jam nut (52) is threaded over the 
stem (12) and forcibly tightened against the adjustment collar (28) 

to prevent accidental adjustment of the stem (12). The female 
thread formation in each of the adjustment collar (28) and jam 

nut (52) includes a wedge ramp positioned across the thread root 
for engaging the thread crest of the corresponding male 

screw formation on the stem (12) to evenly distribute stresses 
through the screw formations.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a surgically 
implantable prosthesis, and more particularly to a 
prosthesis suitable for juvenile patients which provides 
for length adjustment as the patient grows. Many types of skeletal implants and skeletal joint 
prosthesis are available for substitutes of natural 
skeletal components and joints. Such prostheses are used 
when the natural skeletal component has been damaged by 
disease or trauma. However, a problem exists in the case 
of juvenile patient's or other patients where natural 
growth would otherwise be occurring. As the patient grows, 
the limb having the prosthesis implanted will not grow at 
the same rate as the opposing limb unless the prosthesis 
allows for growth along its length. The United States Patent Number 4,892,546 to Cotz et 
al, issued January 9, 1990, discloses an adjustable 
prosthesis for a bone joint including a joint component, an 
elongated rod having a distal end and a proximal end, a 
drive trunion connected to the rod through an annular gear, 
an elongated inner sleeve and an outer sleeve, and means 
for preventing rotation of the inner sleeve within the 
outer sleeve. The elongated rod includes a threaded 
spindle on the inner sleeve and a spindle nut which 
cooperates with the threaded spindle to provide extension 
and retraction adjustment of the rod relative to the inner 
sleeve. The European Patent Application EP 96109228, assigned 
to Waldemar Link GmbH, discloses an endoprosthesis 
replacing bone middle sections including a tubular spacer  
 
with a collar at each end in a solid bone nail extending 
from one collar. A sliding nail fits in a bore of the 
tubular spacer and can be locked in any required position 
by a lock screw. A joint implant is disclosed in the United States 
Patent Number 4,502,160 to Moore et al., issued March 5, 
1985, and assigned to the assignee of the present 
invention, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated 
by reference and relied upon. The Moore et al. patent 
discloses an implant including a stem for bone implantation 
including a threaded portion for adjusting axially with 
respect to an overlying sleeve which carries an 
articulating component of the joint. A pin in the sleeve 
and an elongated slot in the stem restrain relative 
rotation to allow axial relative movement as the stem is 
urged into or out of the sleeve by rotation of a nut 
coacting with the threads of the stem while being axially 
restrained by the sleeve. The nut acts as a ring gear. Although the Moore et al. patent

<CLAIMS>
An adjustable length prosthetic implant 
comprising: an axially extending stem including a male 

screw having a helical thread crest; stem fixation means 
for mounting the stem to a bon
e; an implant body axially 
receiving the stem and including a female screw threadably 

engaging the male screw, the female screw having a helical 
wedge ramp for engaging the thread crest of the male screw; 

body fixation means mounting the implant body at a location 
spaced from the stem fixation means; and locking means 

reactive between the implant body and the stem for forcibly 
maintaining the thread crest in pressed contact with the 

wedge ramp to lock the stem in an axially adjusted position 
relative to the implant body while uniformly distributing 

stresses through the male screw and the female screw. 
An implant as set forth in claim 1 wherein the 
implant body includes a tubular sleeve and an adjustment 

collar rotatably connected to the sleeve. 
An implant as set forth in claim 2 wherein the 
female screw is disposed in the adjustment collar. 
An implant as set forth in claim 3 wherein the 
female screw includes a helical thread crest and a thread 

root with an interposed leading flank facing toward the 
body fixation means and a trailing flank facing away from 

the body fixation means, the wedge ramp position across the 
thread root and angling from the leading flank toward the 

crest at the trailing flank. 
An implant as set forth in claim 4 wherein the 
locking means comprises a jam nut having a female screw for 

threadably engaging the stem. 
An implant as set forth in claim 5 wherein the 
female screw of the jam nut includes a helical thread crest 

 
in a thread root with an interposed leading flank facing 

toward the body fixation means and a trailing flank facing 
away from the body fixation means, and a wedge ramp 

positioned across the thread root of the jam nut and 
angling from the trailing flank toward the crest at the 

leading flank of the jam nut.
