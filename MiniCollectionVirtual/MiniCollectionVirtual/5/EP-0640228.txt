<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR REDUCING MEMORY WEAROUT IN A COMPUTER SYSTEMTECHNICAL FIELDThis invention relates generally to memories of computer systems and, more particularly, to reducing or preventing wearout of storage locations and circuits in computer memory systems.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONBasic computer storage hierarchies include main storage, cache storage and auxiliary storage (for example, disks) . Main storage is typically implemented with either static RAM (SRAM) or dynamic RAM (DRAM) array chips; and main storage stores data that is directly accessible by program software via a corresponding physical address. Cache storage is utilized as a fast buffer for data accessing by the central processing unit (CPU) in order to compensate for the long lead-delays associated with main memory accesses.Breakdown or failure of any one circuit or conductor of a memory chip or system can cause the entire memory chip to fail. One cause of failure of a memory circuit is wearing out of the circuit. Many factors contribute to the wearout of memory circuits. For example, the phenomenon of electromigration is a contributing factor to circuit wearout. ElectroÂ¬ migration is the movement of atoms caused by collisions with energetic electrons. This motion is due to an exchange of momentum between the electrons and the atoms. Over a period of time, voids can form in the metal conductor as a result of electro- 

migration. Voids in a metal conductor causes an increase in current density. This can be explained by the fact that the size of the conductor is reduced as a result of the voids, but the remaining conductor must still carry the same quantity of energetic electrons. Such current density increase accentuates conductor atom movement, thus accelerating metal void growth in the conductor. Eventually, a complete open circuit in the metal conductor may result, possibly causing a breakdown of the entire memory chip.In order to reduce or prevent conductor wearout, current density guidelines for long term reliability are established by memory circuit designers. Essentially, the guidelines dictate how thick a wire must be so as to adequately support a certain current over a given period of time. That period of time being the lifetime of the chip. Reliability guidelines are set so that a memory chip will not likely wear out over its useful lifetime.When memory chips are designed, worse case current density numbers are determined for each circuit. The worse case numbers assume that the same circuit switches every memory
