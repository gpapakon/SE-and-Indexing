<ABSTRACT>
Devices for injecting a fuel-gas mixture are known in which there is a gas chamber partially surrounding the downstream end of the injection valve radially and axially. Various embodiments of flow dividers or deflection surfaces are also known on which sprayed fuel is deflected without the addition of gas. The novel device has a flow divider (86) with a convex divider surface (88) facing the injection port plate (21). The convex flow divider (86) acts as a flow resistor producing a dynamic flow. The dynamic flow is responsible for the maintenance of the multi-jet system, despite gas inclusion, upstream of the flow divider (86) as well and the good preparation effect of the gas inclusion by improved mixing of gas and fuel. The proposed device for injecting a fuel-gas mixture is especially suitable for injection into the intake pipe of a mixture-compression spark-ignition internal combustion engine.

axis (2), with a movable valve-closing body (7), with a 
valve-seat body (16) which is provided at the downstream 

end of the injection valve and has a valve-seat surface 
that interacts with the valve-closing body, with a 

perforated spray disc (21) which is arranged downstream 
of the valve-seat surface and has at least two spray 

openings (25), with a gas jacketing body (41) which 
surrounds the downstream end of the injection valve
