<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an internal combustion
engine of the piston and cylinder type and more particularly to
an improved spherical rotary valve assembly for use with a
rotary valve internal combustion engine for the introduction of
the fuel/air mixture to the cylinder and the evacuation of
exhaust gases.In an internal combustion engine of the piston and
cylinder type, it is necessary to charge the cylinder with a
fuel/air mixture for the combustion cycle and to vent or
evacuate the exhaust gases at the exhaust cycle of each cylinder
of the engine. In the conventional piston and cylinder type
engines, these events occur thousands of times per minute per
cylinder. In the conventional internal combustion engine, the
rotation of a cam shaft causes a spring-loaded valve to open to
enable the fuel and air mixture to flow from the carburetor to
the cylinder and combustion chamber during the induction stroke.
This cam shaft closes this intake valve during the compression
and combustion stroke of the cylinder and the same cam shaft
opens another spring-loaded valve, the exhaust valve, in order
to evacuate the cylinder after compression and combustion have 
occurred. These exhaust gases exit the cylinder and enter the
exhaust manifold.The hardware associated with the efficient operation of
conventional internal combustion engines having spring-loaded
valves includes such items as springs, cotters, guides, rocker
shafts and valves themselves which are usually positioned in the
cylinder head such that they normally operate in a substantially
vertical position with their opening discending into the
cylinder for the introduction or venting or evacuation of gases.As the revolution of the engine increase, the valves open
and close more frequently and the timing and tolerances become
critical in order to prevent the inadvertent contact of the
piston with an open valve which can cause serious engine damage.
With respect to the aforementioned hardware and operation, it is
normal practice for each cylinder to have one exhaust valve and
one intake valve with the associated hardware mentioned
heretofore; however, many internal combustion engines have now
progressed to multiple valve systems, each having the associated
hardware and multiple cam shafts.In the standard internal combustion engine, the cam shaft
is rotated by the crankshaft by means of a timing belt or chain.
The operation of this cam shaft and the associated valves
operated by the cam shaft presents the opportunity to decrease
engine efficiency
