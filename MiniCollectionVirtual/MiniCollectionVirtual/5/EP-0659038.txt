<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel composition
having etching resist properties, a pattern forming
method making use of the composition, a printed-wiring
board and a process for producing the printed-wiring
board.More particularly, this invention is concerned
with printed-wiring board processing in which, in
forming a copper printed-wiring pattern, a resist
pattern for etching a copper-clad laminate is directly
drawn on copper foil by ink-jet printing.Such a process is known from DE-A-3 740 149. A printing ink which
comprises an acrylic polymer having carboxylic acid groups and an acid value
of not less than 35, which is dissolved in water expediently containing a
base and has a viscosity below 10 mPas, is known from EP-A-0 425 439. In conventional subtractive processes used in
printed-wiring board processing, wiring patterns are
formed by preparing pattern films by means of a laser
plotter in accordance with wiring pattern data
outputted from a CAD (computer-aided design system),
and etching copper foil by using a resist ink or a dry
film resist.In such conventional processes, it is
necessary to first form a pattern film, and to prepare 
a printing plate in the case when a resist ink is used
or to take the steps of lamination, exposure and
development in the case when a dry film resist is
used.Such methods currently used can be said to be
a method in which the digitised wiring data are
returned to an analogic image forming step. Screen
printing has a limit to work size because of the
printing precision of the plate. The dry film process
is a photographic process and, though promising a high
precision, requires many steps, inevitably resulting
in a reasonably high cost especially for the
manufacture in small lot.An object of the present invention is to
provide a pattern forming method, a process for
producing a printed-wiring board and an etching resist
composition used therein, that can decrease the number
of steps for forming copper printed wiring patterns
and can achieve a cost reduction.Another object of the present invention is to
provide an etching resist composition that enables
printing on a substrate having no liquid-absorption,
enables stripping of resist patterns printed, and has
etching resist properties. The above objects of the present invention can
be achieved by the invention described below.The present invention is an etching resist
composition defined by the features of claim 1. Such a composition
comprises a polymeric compound having an
acid value of not less than 35, a base, and
