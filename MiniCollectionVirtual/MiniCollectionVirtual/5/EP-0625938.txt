<ABSTRACT>
Proposed is a device for granulating thermally unstable plastics, the device having a plasticizing screw (13) which is located in a housing (14) and is tip-driven  by a drive unit (12). The plasticizing screw (13) conveys the plastic material through outlet ports (27) over which at least one granulating blade (29) which is driven to rotate by a drive unit (7) passes. The drive unit (12) for the plasticizing screw (13) is located at the same end of the screw as the oulet ports (27), the path of the granulating blade (29) passing between this drive unit (12) and the outlet ports (27). The drive shaft (15) for the plasticizing screw (13) is designed as a separate component from the screw and is rotatably and detachably coupled to the end of the screw (13). Air from a blower (10) is used to cool and remove the plastic granules cut off by the blade.

<CLAIMS>
A device for granulating plastics, in particular heat-labile, highly viscous plastics 
such as polyvinyl chloride or polyvinylidene chloride, having at least one rotating 

granulating knife (29) which rotates in front of outlets (27) for the plastics material 
through which the plasticized plastics material is pushed by means of a 

plasticizing worm screw (13) which is mounted in a housing (14) so as to be 
directly before the outlets (27) and is rotated by means of a drive (12), the plastics 

material passing through these outlets (27) with a component of motion directed in 
the axial direction of the plasticizing worn screw (13), and having a cooling 

device (42) for the plastics grains struck off by the granulating knife (29), 
characterised in that the outlets (27) are adjacent to the front end - located at the 

side nearest the drive - of the tip-driven plasticizing worm screw (13), and in that 
the drive (12) for the plasticizing worm screw (13) has a shaft (15) which is 

arranged coaxial with this front end located at the side nearest the drive, is 
encircled by the granulating knife circular path arranged between the drive (12) 

and the outlets (27) and forms a part which is separate from the plasticizing worm 
screw (13) and is coupled to the front end of the plasticizing worm screw (13) in a 

rotationally locked and detachable manner. 
A device in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that the outlets (27) are 
defined by the plasticizing worm screw (13) and its housing (14). 
A device in accordance with Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the shaft (15) is in 
the form of a hollow shaft, is secured in the front end of the plasticizing worm 

screw (13) by means of a screw (18) in a tensionally locked, axially adjustable 
manner and is coupled to the plasticizing worm screw (13) by means of at least 

one wedge (20) or toothing so as to carried along therewith in a rotationally locked 
manner. 
A device in accordance with Claim 2 or 3, characterised in that the outlets (27) are 
formed by longitudinal or helical channels (24) at the circumference of a flange 

(22) at the plasticizing worm screw front end located at the side nearest the drive, 
the flange (22) being directly adjacent to the last threads (21) of the plasticizing 

worm screw (13) and contacting with the inner surface of the housing (14), and the  
 

granulating knife (29) being rotatably mounted on the shaft (15) and being 
connected to a drive (7) for relative rotation in relation to the shaft (15). 
A device in accordance with Claim 4, characterised in that the granulating knife 
(29) is secured to the front end - adjacent to the plasticizing worm screw (13) - of 

a sleeve (32) rotatably mounted on the shaft (15), the drive (7) for the granulating 
knife (29) acting upon this sleeve (32), preferably by means of a toothed belt (35). 
A device in accordance with Claim 4 or 5, characterised in that the portion of the 
housing (14) covering the longitudinal channels (24) forms a ring (25) which is 

separate from the housing (14) and is detachably connected thereto, preferably by 
means of screws (26). 
A device in accordance with any one of Claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the 
cooling device (42) is formed by a delivery fan (10) for the struck-off granular 

material particles, and in that this delivery fan (10) is attached to the frame (16) 
surrounding the shaft (15) via an inlet (37) for the delivery air which is preferably 

arranged radially to the shaft (15), an outlet (41) for the struck-off granular 
material particles which is preferably also arranged radially to the shaft (15) being 

provided for delivery of these particles to a collecting station, e.g. a sack-filling 
station (9). 
A device in accordance with Claim 7, characterised in that the inlet (37) and the 
outlet (41) for the cooling air are arranged at either side of the shaft (15) and are 

connected to an annular chamber (38) surrounding the granulating knife (29), this 
annular chamber (38) being bounded at one of its end faces by a wall (28) 

supporting the housing (14) of the plasticizing worm screw (13) and at the 
opposite end face by a disc (39) connected to the shaft (15) or to the sleeve (32) 

mounted on the latter.
