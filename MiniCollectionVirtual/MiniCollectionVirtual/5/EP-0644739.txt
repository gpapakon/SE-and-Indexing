<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for determination of the mineral content in bones and comprising an X-ray source (12) capable of releasing X-ray radiation at at least two different energy levels for radiation of a preselected target area, and a camera part including a scintillator (22) receiving the X-ray radiation which have passed through the target area and emitting visible light, a CCD-sensor (25), and optical means for focusing the radiation from the scintillator on the CCD-sensor (25). The CCD-sensor communicates with an electronic circuit adapted to read out the CCD-sensor and to transfer data signals to a computer, said data signals representing the received radiation intensity and consequently a number of images (usually two received at their respective energy level) of the part of a person which should be examined. The apparatus is adapted to limit the energy content of the X-ray radiation emitted through the person in such a manner that the skin of said person is not subjected to more than a predetermined, allowed amount of energy. In this mananer an apparatus for determination of the mineral content in bones of living persons is provided, and this apparatus is smaller and less expensive than the hitherto known apparatuses at the same time as it is easy and quick to use, whereby the examination can be performed by a specialized physician.

<DESCRIPTION>
Title: Bone mineral camera-Technical FieldThe present invention relates to an apparatus for determination of the mineral content in bones and comprising an X-ray source capable of releasing X-ray radiation at at least two different energy levels for radi¬ ation of a preselected target area, a scintillator receiving the X-ray radi¬ ation having passed through the target area and emitting visible light, a CCD sensor, and optical means for focusing the radiation from the scintillator on the CCD sensor.A knowledge of the mineral content in bones is of vital importance for the possibility of evaluating a person's risk of being subjected to frac¬ tures and consequently for the possibility of evaluating the optional preventive treatment applying. A demand applies for a possibility for the specialized physicians of performing such a determination of the mineral content in bones because the possibilities of finding the patients needing the preventive treatment are thereby considerably increased.The energy content of the applied radiation should be limited such that the patient does not receive more than the maximum allowed amount of energy on his skin. Data signals representing a number of images (usually two) of the body area of the patient to be examined are trans¬ ferred from the CCD-sensor or the camera to a computer.Background ArtWO 91 /09495 discloses an X-ray apparatus of the above type which images the entire measuring area on a CCD through a scintillator.US-PS No. 4,947,414 and the corresponding Danish Patent Application 

No. 1320/88 discloses furthermore an apparatus for determination of the bone density, said apparatus scanning the target. Similar appar¬ atuses have been described in several other publications, such as EP 0 253 742; EP 0 274 522; EP 0 432 730; and WO 91 /1 1 147.Such apparatuses are used together with a computer of a capacity sufficiently high for allowing processing of image signals. The computer includes programmes allowing it to both process data signals represent¬ ing the X-ray images and based thereon to produce images of the bone density in a target. Furthermore, the computer is preferably adapted to adjust the calculations in response to periodic calibration measurements on a known target in such a manner that the intensity or the colour of each image element, the so-called pixels, contains information on the density of the tissue through which the radiation has passed. The com¬ puter can also be adjusted to calculate and display the density either in each pixel or for a small
