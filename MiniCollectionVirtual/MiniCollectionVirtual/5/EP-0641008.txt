<ABSTRACT>
This method makes it possible to form a fluorescent film (10) easily and efficiently on a glass plate (18), 
particularly on the face plate (8) of a cathode ray tube. A transfer material for its use is also provided. The method 

comprises the steps of, by use of the transfer material (7) in which at least thermally transferable phospher layers (11, 
12 and 13) containing phosphers and thermally fusible binder are formed on a base film (3), transferring the patterns 

of the thermally transferrable phospher layers (11, 12 and 13) to the glass plate (8) one after another; and baking the 
glass plate (8) to remove the binder from the fluorescent film (10) and to form the fluorescence film on the glass plate. 

The transfer material has a thermally transferable phosphor layer (4) containing at least phosphs (1) and thermally 
fusible binder (2) on the base film (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for easily and 
efficiently forming a fluorescent film on a glass substrate, in 
particular, on a face plate of a cathode ray tube, and to a transfer 
material used for such a method. The slurry application and exposure method and the 
sedimentation method have been used as methods for forming the 
fluorescent film on the face plate of the cathode ray tube. In the above-mentioned slurry application and exposure method, 
a slurry in which a fluorescent material is dispersed in a 
photosensitive resin consisting, for example, of polyvinyl alcohol 
and ammonium bichromate is spin-coated on the face plate, dried, and 
exposed to ultraviolet rays to form desired patterns. The film is 
developed using water for removing unexposed portions to form a 
fluorescent film. The slurry application and exposure method for forming the 
fluorescent film has disadvantages such as a large number of steps, 
complicated equipment, and low productivity. In the above-mentioned sedimentation method, the fluorescent 
film is formed by allowing a fluorescent material to be deposited on 
the face plate from a suspension containing the fluorescent material  
 
and a binder, such as water glass, and allowing a supernatant to 
flow slowly. The sedimentation method also has disadvantages because it 
takes a long time for allowing the fluorescent material to be 
deposited, and it is difficult to form a desired pattern. It is an object of the present invention to eliminate such 
problems and to provide a method for easily and efficiently forming 
the fluorescent film on the glass substrate, in particular, on the 
face plate of the cathode ray tube, and to provide a transfer 
material used for such a method. The inventors studied the solution of the above problems and 
found that the fluorescent film may be formed on the face plate of 
the cathode ray tube easily and efficiently by the heat transfer 
method. The heat transfer method is widely used in personal word 
processors, color printers and the like, and is a method for heating 
an ink and transferring the ink onto recording paper in a desired 
pattern, for example, by heaing and pressing an ink ribbon 
consisting of a thermally fusible ink on a base material, from the 
back of the ink layer with a heating element such as a thermal head. An aspect of the present invention is a method for forming the 
fluorescent film on the glass substrate, comprising using a transfer 
material consisting of a thermally transferable fluorescent layer
