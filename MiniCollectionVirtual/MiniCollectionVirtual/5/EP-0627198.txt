<ABSTRACT>
Absorption filters (11) are positioned in an x-ray examination 
apparatus 

by adjusting them on the basis of the posture of the carrier (1) 
supporting the x-ray source (2) and the x-ray detector (3). To that end 

adjustment curves 
relating carrier posture to filter adjustment are employed. The posture 

of the carrier 
determines the orientation of the x-ray beam path. Because there are 

relatively few 
anatomical differences among patients to be examined, the adjustment of 

absorption 
filters on the basis of the beam orientation is quite adequate. Further 

improvement is 
achieved by providing sets of adjustment curves, each set pertaining to 

a class of 
patients, such as e.g. corpulent or slender patients, or infants or 

adults.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an x-ray apparatus comprising a carrier
supporting an x-ray source for producing an x-ray beam, an x-ray detector facing the x-ray
source and an adjustable absorption filter which is arranged between the x-ray
source and the x-ray detector, the carrier being movable to direct the x-ray
beam path.An x-ray apparatus of said kind is known from the European patent
application EP 0 496 438.An x-ray apparatus as described in the cited European patent application is
provided with absorption filters having the form of movable wedge filters. To prevent
areas in an x-ray image from being overexposed, wedge filters are positioned so that
very low x-ray absorption areas adjacent to strong x-ray absorption areas are blocked
out to some extent. Wedge filters are positioned in the known x-ray examination
apparatus on the basis of contour recognition during the formation of the x-ray
image.
Consequently, complicated image processing means are required.It is an object of the invention to provide an x-ray examination apparatus
for producing an x-ray image in which overexposed areas are reduced. It is also an
object of the invention to reduce a dose of x-radiation required for producing the x-ray
image.To achieve this, an x-ray examination apparatus according to the invention
is characterized in that the x-ray examination apparatus is provided with filter-control
means for accepting a posture of the carrier and furnishing a position of the absorption
filter so as to control the adjustment of the absorption filter.When a shadow-image is made of a part of a patient's body to be
examined by means of x-irradiation, there are areas of the x-ray image in which 
overexposure is to be avoided in that these areas are blocked out by means of an
absorption filter. The location of such areas with respect to a region of interest in the x-ray
image is determined by the orientation of the x-ray beam path with respect to the
patient. Since anatomical structures show a comparatively limited variation among various
patients, the location of areas subjected to risk of overexposure is predominantly
determined from the position of the carrier on which the x-ray source and the x-ray
detector are mounted. Thus, absorption filters are adequately positioned by providing
filter-control means that control the positioning of the moveable absorption filter on the
basis of the posture of the carrier. In this manner, with respect to the patient and with
respect to a patient support table, protracted irradiation of the patient
