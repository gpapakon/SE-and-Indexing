<ABSTRACT>
A driver circuit (10) for a power output stage, having a power driver stage (20) driving the power output stage; a control circuit (40) driving the power driver stage (20) and having an input stage (90); and a power supply stage (30), the input stage (90) having a device (TR1) for the potential-isolated injection of input signals, and the power supply stage (30) having a device (TR2) for the potential-isolated injection of electrical power. Such a driver circuit provides for short signal transit times, is of small construction and has a wide clock frequency bandwidth.
