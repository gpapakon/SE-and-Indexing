<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for making perchloroethylene by thermal, 
noncatalytic pyrolysis of carbon tetrachloride in the presence of elemental hydrogen and 
chlorine at relatively low temperatures. In particular, it relates to a process for production of 
perchloroethylene and hydrogen chloride using carbon tetrachloride as both the principal 
reactant and a reactive diluent under conditions which maximize consumption of unwanted 
carbon tetrachloride, while minimizing the production of heavy ends, such as 
hexachlorobenzene and other tarry products. When conventionally manufacturing perchloroethylene by chlorination of 
hydrocarbons and/or their partially chlorinated derivatives, substantial amounts of carbon 
tetrachloride are also obtained. In addition, substantial quantities of undesirable highly 
chlorinated products such as hexachloroethane, hexachlorobutadiene and hexachlorobenzene, 
hereinafter referred to as heavy ends, are formed. Carbon tetrachloride, however, is thought 
to be among the halocarbons which cause destruction of the ozone layer and is therefore 
coming to be considered a relatively undesirable product. It has also been used as a 
feedstock in producing environmentally deleterious fully halogenated chlorofluorocarbons and 
demand for it is therefore decreasing for this reason as well. Because of these undesirable 
environmental attributes of carbon tetrachloride, regulations governing the production and use 
of carbon tetrachioride are expected to result in a marked decrease in demand for carbon 
tetrachloride over the next decade. The heavy ends resulting from conventional processes for  
 
producing perchloroethylene are also undesirable and their disposal by burning can result in 
emission of undesirable compounds into the atmosphere. On the other hand, the ecologically 
more benign chlorinated hydrocarbons, notably perchloroethylene, are expected to remain in 
high demand because of their many practical uses, both as a solvent and as a starting 
material for the production of other chemicals. The present invention addresses this situation 
by providing a process for the production of perchloroethylene that consumes carbon 
tetrachloride and minimizes formation of heavy ends. Perchloroethylene can be produced by pyrolysis of carbon tetrachloride at high 
temperatures as mentioned in U.S. Patent No. 1,930,350. As explained in U.S. Patent No. 
3,364,272, the pyrolysis process for production of perchloroethylene ordinarily requires 
reaction temperatures of the order
