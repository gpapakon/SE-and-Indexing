<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a circuit arrangement for operating a discharge 
lamp, comprising a DC-AC converter provided with 


a branch A having ends suitable for being connected to a DC voltage source and 
comprising a series circuit of two switching elements for generating a periodic 

voltage by being conducting and non-conducting alternately with a frequency f, 
each switching element being shunted by a diode, 
a control circuit coupled to control electrodes of the switching elements for 
rendering the switching elements conducting and non-conducting alternately 

with the frequency f, 
a load branch B which shunts one of the switching elements and which 
comprises inductive means L and means for coupling the discharge lamp to the 

load branch B, 
means M for adjusting the power consumed by the discharge lamp. 
According to the invention, the means M comprise means Mp for 
adjusting the value of the difference Tt-Td, in which Tt is a time interval during which 

one of the switching elements is conducting during a half cycle of the periodic voltage, 
and Td is a time interval during which a diode is conducting during this same half cycle 

of the periodic voltage. 
It is achieved by this that the discharge lamp burns in a stable manner 
over a wide range of the adjustable power.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a circuit arrangement for operating a discharge
lamp, comprising a DC-AC converter provided with
a branch A having ends suitable for being connected to a DC voltage source and
comprising a series circuit of two switching elements for generating a periodic
voltage by being conducting and non-conducting alternately with a frequency f,
each switching element being shunted by a diode,a control circuit coupled to control electrodes of the switching elements for
rendering the switching elements conducting and non-conducting alternately
with the frequency f, a load branch B which shunts one of the switching elements and which
comprises inductive means L and means for coupling the discharge lamp to the
load branch B, means M for adjusting the power consumed by the discharge lamp.  Such a circuit is known from
EP-A-0 430 358. The circuit described in that document comprises a
control function for preventing that Td becomes smaller than a
predetermined threshold value. Such a circuit is also known from
EP-A-0 323 676. In this patent,
both the frequency f of the DC-AC converter and the time interval Tt during which
each of the switching elements is conducting are presented as parameters by which it is
possible to adjust the power consumed by the lamp. It was found that the use of one of
these parameters renders it possible to adjust the luminous flux of the lamp over a wide
range by comparatively simple electronic auxiliary means. A disadvantage which may
arise when the frequency f is used as the parameter is that the relation between the
power consumed by the discharge lamp and the frequency f is not unequivocal over the
entire range of frequencies which can be set. Especially when the power consumed by
the discharge lamp is comparatively low, each value of the frequency f in a certain
range of this frequency f can correspond to two lamp power values. This results in an
unstable burning of the lamp. It is found for very many discharge lamps in practice,
especially compact fluorescent lamps, that it is not possible for this reason to adjust
comparatively low values of the power consumed by the discharge lamp. In other
words, the range over which the discharge lamp can be dimmed is limited. It should be noted that European Patent 482705 describes a possible
solution to this problem. This solution, however, is comparatively complicated and
expensive.An important disadvantage connected with the use of the time interval Tt
as a parameter is that, depending on the dimensions of the discharge
