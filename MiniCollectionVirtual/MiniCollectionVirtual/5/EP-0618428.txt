<ABSTRACT>
A fluid level sensing system, particularly for 
sensing the water level in a steam generating boiler, 

comprises a vessel connected to the boiler so as to 
contain water and steam at substantially the same level 

as in the boiler, a number of vertically spaced 
electrodes projecting into the vessel, and circuitry 

for measuring the electrical impedance sensed by each 
electrode. The circuitry, which can be multiplexed to 

each electrode in turn, includes a first comparator for 
producing an output when the sensed impedance lies 

between the normal maximum impedance of the water and 
the normal minimum impedance of the steam above the 

water, this output being demultiplexed to drive a 
vertical display to show the level of the steam/water 

interface. The circuitry additionally includes a 
second comparator for producing a further output when 

the sensed impedance lies below the normal minimum 
impedance of the water, which further output is 

indicative of a variety of different fault conditions 
and drives a fault indicator.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to fluid level sensing
systems, and is more particularly but not exclusively
concerned with boiler water level sensing systems of
the general kind disclosed in United Kingdom Patents
Nos 1 056 032 and 1 438 271.Boiler water level sensing systems of the kind
described in United Kingdom Patents Nos 1 056 032 and
1 438 271 typically comprise a vertically extending
cylindrical pressure vessel, sometimes called a "water
column", adapted to be connected near its top and near
its bottom to one end of a boiler, such that the water
level in the pressure vessel is substantially the same
as the water level in the boiler. A plurality of
vertically spaced electrodes sealingly project into the
pressure vessel, and are used to sense the electrical
impedance of the fluid in the pressure vessel at the
respective level of each electrode. Since the minimum
electrical impedance of steam is significantly greater
than the maximum electrical impedance of water, the
position of the water/steam interface can readily be
established. Systems of this kind are currently
commercialised by the Applicant under the trade mark
HYDRASTEP.In high pressure steam generating plant using
such a boiler to generate steam to drive a steam
turbine, an exceptional degree of reliability is
required. This is because failure of the water level
sensing system can lead either to extensive damage to
the boiler, which can be extremely expensive, or to
water ingress into the steam turbine, which can be
catastrophic, even leading in extreme cases to loss of
life. At the same time, however, it is important that
the water level sensing system should not give
erroneous warning signals resulting in unnecessary 
plant shutdown, since such shutdowns are also very
expensive.To this end, current systems are provided with
validation circuitry which provides a fault indication
if, for example, water is apparently detected above
steam. Additionally, the impedance measuring (or
discrimination) circuitry associated with the upper
electrodes, which are normally in steam, is arranged
such that the most commonly experienced failure modes
lead to a water indication, while the impedance
measuring (or discrimination) circuitry associated with
the lower electrodes, which are normally in water, is
arranged such that the most commonly experienced
failure modes lead to a steam indication. This, in
combination with the validation circuitry, provides
excellent reliability and fault detection, but means
that two different kinds of impedance measuring
circuitry
