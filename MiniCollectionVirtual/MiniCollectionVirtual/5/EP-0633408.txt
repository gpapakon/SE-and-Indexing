<ABSTRACT>
A power transmission belt having an endless body with a length and 
defining an elongate rib (38). The body has an inside, an outside, and 

laterally spaced 
sides. The rib has an exposed surface (40,42) to engage with a 

cooperating pulley. At least 
a first portion of the exposed rib surface is formed by at least 

one of grinding and 
cutting. There is a second portion (66) of the exposed surface that is 

neither cut nor 
ground during formation of the power transmission belt.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to power transmission belts and, more
particularly, to a power transmission belt having at least one rib with a discrete
projection thereon that reduces the tendency of the rib to develop cracks in
operation.V-ribbed belts are used in a wide range of environments. V-ribbed
belts are preferred for their high power transmission capability which is attributable
to the increase in contact area between the ribs on the belt and cooperating pulleys.In operation, there is a tendency of the ribs on this type of belt to
crack. These cracks typically originate at the free ends of the ribs, remote from the
roots thereof, or at the transition between the inwardly (or outwardly in the event
of a double-ribbed belt) facing rib surface portions and the pulley-engaging side
surface portions. These cracks tend to grow as the belt operates and may progress
to the point that the ribs chip. The cracks may ultimately extend fully to the load-carrying
cords, which may sever. The result is that the performance of the belt may
be compromised. Premature failure may also result.This cracking problem is particularly prevalent in serpentine drive
systems in which a flat, outside surface of the V-ribbed belt is forcibly engaged by
a flat pulley. These systems, typically used on automobile engines, have idler
pulleys with flat surfaces to be pressed against the back surface of the belt to
maintain a desired tension thereon. One attempted solution to this cracking problem is descnbed in
Japanese Patent Publication No. 59-4196. Fig. 5 herein shows a belt incorporating
the invention in Japanese Patent Publication No. 59-4196. The V-ribbed belt at 10
in Fig.6 has a plurality of ribs 12, each having a free end with an inwardly facing
surface portion 14. A thin layer 16 of elastic rubber is applied to the surface
portion 14. The belt 10 has a plurality of laterally extending, short fibers 18
embedded in the ribs 12 for reinforcement thereof.The ribs 12 are typically formed using a cutting or grinding wheel
having surfaces that are roughened by abrasion or by adhering thereto diamond
particles through an electrodeposition process. The roughened cutting/grinding
surfaces tend to tear the embedded, short fibers 18 out of the ribs 12 at the surface
portion 14 and/or at convex transition surface portions 20 between the surface
portion 14 and the pulley-engaging side surface portions 22,24.While the tearing out of the fibers creates only a slight scratch on the
exposed belt surface, the scratches tend to grow, particularly
