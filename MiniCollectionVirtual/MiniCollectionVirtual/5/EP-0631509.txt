<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for separating blood into blood components and to apparatus for removing blood components from a blood container which has at least one outlet opening. The method comprises introducing blood into a blood container which has at least one outlet opening in the upper limit of the container, centrifuging the blood container in a relatively high centrifugal field to form three mutually superimposed component layers, applying pressure to the blood container to remove the upper component through the outlet opening and, during or after this pressure stage, forming in the blood container a channel through which a second component is connected with the outlet opening or with a second outlet opening, and then applying further pressure to remove the second component through the channel formed. The apparatus for removing centrifuged and stratified blood components from a blood container (1a) having at least one outlet opening includes a housing (16) which has mounted therein a first and a second pressure plate (3, 2) which are movable in relation to one another, a suspension means (50) by means of which the blood container (1a) can be positioned between the pressure plates (3, 2), and means for achieving relative movement of the pressure plates. The apparatus also includes a mandrel (5) in the second pressure plate (2) which is operative in forming a channel in the container (1a) as the blood container (1a) is compressed to remove the uppermost blood component, this channel connecting a blood container outlet opening with the bottom blood component and being formed only when the upper component has been removed from the blood container.

<DESCRIPTION>
 BLOOD SEPARATION METHOD AND APPARATUSTechnical FieldThe present invention relates to a method of separating blood into blood components and of transferring stratified components obtained by centrifugation to component containers and also to an arrangement of apparatus for trans¬ ferring the stratified components obtained by centrifugation to respective connected component containers. Background Art Whole blood is collected in flexible blood containers to which one or more component containers are connected. In order to utilize the whole blood effec¬ tively, the blood collected is typically divided into three fractions, i.e. a plasma fraction, buffycoat fraction and cell concentrate fraction, of which two fractions are normally then transferred to their respective component containers. This division or stratification of the blood into said components is effected by centrifugation. When whole blood is centrifuged, the plasma fraction, which is the specifically lightest fraction, is uppermost, whereas the erythrocyte fraction, which is the specifically heaviest fraction, is undermost and the buffycoat fraction is located therebetween. Volumet cally speaking, the plasma fraction is the largest and therewith the most fluid of the components concerned.The most common type of blood container has an outlet opening to which there is connected a pipe which has at least one branch line leading to individual blood-component containers. Normally, two component containers are connected to the blood container. An arrangement for use in pressing stratified blood components from a blood container to respective component containers is known from EP-A- 0,348,682. This known arrangement includes a vertical plate which is provided with means on which a blood container containing stratified blood component layers can be hung. A second plate is mounted in the upper part of the first- mentioned plate, on a level with the upper limitation of the blood container. This second plate is pivotally mounted to the first plate by means of a vertical pivot axle spaced from said first plate.When transferring the blood components to respective component containers, the second plate is brought into abutment with the blood container and exerts pressure thereonto until essentially all plasma fraction has been transferred to its intended container. This component container is then closed and the next fraction, which is the buffycoat fraction, is transferred to the second container. This second container is closed when all buffycoat has been

Claims
1. A method of separating blood into blood components, comprising introducing blood into a blood container which has at least one blood compo¬ nent outlet opening at the upper limit of the container, and centrifuging the blood container in a relatively high centrifugal field to form an upper plasma fraction, an intermediate buffycoat fraction and an erythrocyte fraction, characterized by applying pressure to the blood container for removal of plasma fraction through the outlet opening and forming in the blood container during or after this pressure stage a connecting channel through which a second fraction is connected with the outlet opening or with a second outlet opening; and then applying a higher pressure for removal of the second fraction through the formed connecting channel.
2. A method according to Claim 1 , characterized by forming the connecting channel subsequent to having removed a desired quantity of plasma fraction. 3. A method according to Claim 1 or 2, in which the second fraction is the erythrocyte fraction, characterized by forming the connecting channel in a generally U-shape with the base of the connecting channel communicating with the outlet opening through which the erythrocyte fraction shall be removed and the legs of said channel connecting with the erythrocyte fraction. 4. A method according to one or more of Claims 1-3, characterized by applying the pressure for removal of the plasma fraction essentially on the upper part of the blood container.
5. Apparatus for removing blood components from a blood container (1a) which has at least one outlet opening (17) and which contains blood that has been stratified into blood components by centrifugation, said apparatus includ¬ ing a housing (16) which has mounted therein a first and a second pressure plate (3, 2) which are movable relative to one another, a suspension means (50) for positioning the blood container (1a) between the pressure plates (2, 3), and means (15) for causing the pressure plates (2, 3) to move relative to one another, characterized by a mandrel (5) in one of the pressure plates (2), said mandrel functioning to form a connecting channel (33) as the blood container (1a) is compressed for the removal of the plasma fraction contained therein, said connecting channel (33) connecting the blood container outlet opening (17) with the bottom fraction, and said connecting channel (33) being formed only when the plasma fraction has been removed.

8. Apparatus according to Claim 6, characterized in that the strip (4) is provided on that side thereof remote from the pressure plate (2) with a channel (11 ) which permits fluid to pass when no load is exerted on the strip (4) or when the strip is subjected to pressure which is lower than the first selected pressure. 9. Apparatus according to one or more of Claims 5-8, characterized in that one pressure plate (2) covers at least the whole of the blood container (1 a) and the opposing pressure plate (3) covers the upper part of said blood container (1a). 10.
