<ABSTRACT>
A process for processing a water-free lithographic 
printing plate comprising a photosensitive layer and a 

silicone rubber layer laminated on a support in this order is 
disclosed, the process comprising the steps of imagewise 

exposing the lithographic printing plate; developing the 
exposed lithographic printing plate with an aqueous developer 

capable of peeling off substantially only the silicone rubber 
layer on the unexposed area; and then dyeing the image area 

with a dye solution containing at least one sparingly water-soluble 
compound and at least one hydrotrope agent or a dye 

solution comprising at least one compound represented by the 
following formula (I):



R¹O-(C₃H₆O)
n
-R²   (I)



 
wherein R¹ represents a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl 

group, a substituted or unsubstituted aryl group, a 
substituted or unsubstituted aralkyl group or a substituted 

or unsubstituted alkenyl group; R² represents a hydrogen 
atom, an alkyl group, an aryl group, an aralkyl group or an 

alkenyl group; and n represents an integer of 2 or more. In 
accordance with the processing method according to the 

present invention, the non-image area can be efficiently 
plasticized without damaging the silicone rubber layer during  

 
processing, thereby improving the scratch resistance in 

handling and the press life during printing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
processing a photosensitive lithographic printing plate 
requiring no fountain solution comprising a photosensitive 
layer and a silicone rubber layer laminated on a support in 
this order and more particularly to a process for processing 
the photosensitive lithographic printing plate requiring no 
fountain solution which provides improvements in the scratch 
resistance and press life of the silicone rubber layer. Various photosensitive lithographic printing plates 
requiring no fountain solution (hereinafter referred to as 
"water-free lithographic printing plate") for lithographic 
printing without fountain solution have been proposed. Among 
them, those comprising a photosensitive layer and a silicone 
rubber layer coated on a support in this order as disclosed 
in JP-B-54-26923 (The term "JP-B" as used herein means an 
"examined Japanese patent publication"), JP-B-55-22781, JP-B-56-23150, 
and JP-A-2-236550 (The term "JP-A" as used herein 
means an "unexamined published Japanese patent application") 
have extremely high performances. As a process for the development of such a water-free 
lithographic printing plate there is disclosed a process 
which comprises the use of a hydrocarbonic organic solvent  
 
which swells only a silicone rubber layer or a hydrocarbonic 
organic solvent with a polar solvent added thereto in JP-B-56-23150, 
JP-A-57-13448, JP-A-59-146054, and JP-A-63-52145. 
However, this process requires a long development time. In 
order to obtain fine halftone dots on the highlight with a 
good reproducibility, it is necessary that the printing plate 
be brushed to a certain extent. Accordingly, this process is 
disadvantageous in that even the silicone rubber layer to be 
left as non-image area can be damaged. On the other hand, 
JP-B-63-46407 discloses a process which comprises eluting a 
part or whole of the photosensitive layer on the image area 
with a processing solution capable of dissolving at least a 
part of the photosensitive layer on the image area, and then 
rubbing the printing plate in the presence of water or a 
solvent mainly composed of water which doesn't swell the 
silicone rubber layer to peel off the silicone rubber layer. 
Further, JP-A-1-159644 and JP-A-3-231752 disclose a developer 
comprising water as a main component. These approaches can 
provide drastic reduction of damage of the silicone rubber 
layer on the non-image area during development but leave much 
to be desired in the prevention of damage on the
