<ABSTRACT>
Adherent traces of a carbide-forming conductive 
metal are produced on a diamond surface, without 

deposition of carbide in areas to be non-conductive, by 
depositing an undercoat layer of a non-carbide-forming 

metal such as palladium, patterning said undercoat layer 
and then depositing a bond layer of the carbide-forming 

metal. The undercoat layer and the portion of the bond layer 
deposited thereon are then removed, typically by etching.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the processing of 
diamond for electronic applications, and more particularly, 
to providing metal traces on diamond surfaces. Diamond is of high interest as a substrate 
material for use in integrated circuits and multi-chip 
modules. This is particularly true of synthetic diamond 
prepared by chemical vapor deposition (hereinafter "CVD 
diamond); i.e., by thermal activation of a mixture of 
hydrogen and a hydrocarbon at low pressure, whereupon 
diamond is deposited on a substrate surface. By reason of 
its low electrical and high thermal conductivity and 
consequent efficiency as a heat sink material, it is of 
particular interest for use in high density interconnect 
modules and circuits containing laser diodes, where the 
circuit elements are packed closely together and heat 
dissipation is essential. The manufacture of such modules generally 
requires the deposition of connecting conductive metal 
traces on the diamond surface. It is conventional to employ 
carbide-forming metals for such traces, since carbide 
formation by reaction of the metal at the surface of the 
diamond provides strong adhesion of the metal trace to said 
surface. Ordinarily, the entire diamond surface is 
metallized and the resulting metal layer is 
photolithographically patterned and etched to remove the 
metal in the areas where traces are not desired. A major problem with this technique is that 
while the metal may be removed by etching, the carbide 
generally is not. It is also highly conductive and would 
cause short circuits if it remained on the diamond surface.  
 
Therefore, additional steps to remove carbide are 
necessary. Such steps introduce a high degree of 
complexity, since the only etching solutions which are 
effective to remove carbide also attack photoresists. One technique which has been employed with 
some success is reactive ion etching. However, it is capital 
intensive and presents a risk of attack to the metal traces. 
Another technique is oxidation of the diamond underneath 
the carbide, followed by lifting the carbide away. However, 
its success depends to a high extent on the thickness and 
porosity of the carbide layer and submits the metallization 
to repeated thermal excursions, resulting in possible 
damage. Still another technique is laser ablation, but it 
forms grooves in the diamond and is not adaptable to fine 
detail work of the sort required for integrated circuits and 
multi-chip modules. Accordingly, the development of a method to 
prevent contact of
