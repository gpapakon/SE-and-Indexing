<ABSTRACT>
A system for separating lined-up 
seedlings, which separates an individual 

seedling from lined-up seedlings in a 
transplanting machine using the lined-up 

seedlings such as seedlings each contained 
in a paper tube, by use of paper-tube containers 

for growing the seedlings orderly 
connected with one another so as to be separable 

to provide individual seedlings in 
a transplantation culture of crops, characterized 

in that said system comprises: a 
first seedling moving mechanism (10) 

mounted thereon with the lined-up seedlings 
(P) orderly connected with one another 

so as to be separable into individual 
seedlings and reciprocatingly movable in 

one direction; a second seedling moving 
mechanism (20) provided on the first seedling 

moving mechanism (10) and intermittently 
movable in a direction perpendicularly intersecting the moving direction of the first seedling moving mechanism (10) at a 

moving end of the first seedling moving mechanism (10), for delivering one line of the lined-up seedlings (P) at a time; and a pair 
of rotors for separation (31, 32) positioned in front of the moving direction of the second seedling moving mechanism (20) and 

opposed to the foremost line of the delivered lined-up seedlings, whereby one (31) of the rotors for separation comes into abutting 
contact with a foremost seedling (Pa), is forwardly rotated with respect to the moving direction of seedlings by the first seedling 

moving mechanism (10) and is rotated at a circumferential speed higher than the moving speed of the first seedling moving mechanism 
(10), while, the other (32) of the rotors for separation is reversely rotated with respect to the moving direction of seedlings 

and is positioned close to the side of the succeeding line of the seedlings.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for 
separating arranged nursery plants into an individual 
plant in a transplanter using arranged nursery plants 
such as paper cylindrical nursery plants orderly connected 
to be separatable into the individual plant in 
the a paper cylindrical nursery cabinet in a 
transplanting culture of agricultural products. In an apparatus for automatically separating the 
arranged nursery plants like paper cylinder into an 
individual plant, there has been tried that a needle 
material is stuck into the paper cylindrical nursery 
cabinet to separate the arranged nursery plants into 
each plant. However, such an apparatus has not been 
completed yet. In Japanese Patent Application KOKAI Publication 
No. 63-50962, there is proposed a separating apparatus 
using a plurality of rolls rotating to press on the 
front surface of a plant to be separated from the 
arranged nursery plants. In the above conventional apparatus in which the 
needle material is stuck into the paper cylindrical 
nursery cabinet to separate the arranged nursery plants  
 
into each plant, paper forming the paper cylindrical 
nursery cabinet is rotted during the period of raising 
of seedling, and its strength is lowered. As a result, 
paper is broken, a separation mistake occurs. Then, the 
residual plants are an obstacle to a next separation. 
Due to this, there was a case that the separation 
mistake continuously occurs. Moreover, in the above separating apparatus using 
a plurality of rolls rotating to press on the front 
surface of a plant to be separated from the arranged 
nursery plants, one separation roll corresponds to one 
plant to be separated. After raising of seedling, the 
connecting strength of the paper cylindrical nursery 
cabinet is not fixed by the degree of rotting paper and 
amount of water. Moreover, since the plant to be 
separated is peeled from the connecting section with the 
continuous plant array, the plant to be separated is not 
individually separated, and the separation is performed 
in a mass of two or three plants. Due to this, there 
was a case that the separation become uncertain. In order to solve the above problems, and surely 
separate the arranged plants into an individual plant, 
an object of the present invention is to provide an 
apparatus having a high performance and a high efficiency 
in which the arranged nursery plants can be 
consciously and surely separated into an individual 
plant, and a transplanting culture can be considerably 
expanded.

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for separating arranged nursery plants 
comprising a first nursery plant moving mechanism 

mounting arranged nursery plants orderly connected to be 
separatable to an individual plant, and being capable of 

reciprocating in one direction; a second plant nursery 
plant moving mechanism, provided on said first nursery 

plant moving mechanism, intermittently moving in a 
direction perpendicular to the moving direction at an 

end of the movement of said first nursery plant moving 
mechanism, and delivering only one row of said arranged 

nursery plants; and a pair of separation rotators, positioned 
at a front surface of the moving direction of 

said second plant moving mechanism to be opposite to the 
front row of said arranged nursery plants to be delivered, 

characterized in that one of said separation 
rotators contacts the plant of the front row of the 

plants, is positively rotated in a plant moving direction 
by said first moving mechanism, and rotated at a 

higher peripheral speed than the moving speed, and the 
other separation rotator is rotated in a direction opposite 

to said plant moving direction, and positioned 
close to a continuous row of the plants.
