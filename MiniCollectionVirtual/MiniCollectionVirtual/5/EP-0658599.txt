<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polyacetal
resin having an excellent weather (light) resistance.
More specifically, a UV absorber and two kinds of the
specific hindered amine series light stabilizers are
used in combination for a polyacetal resin to provide a
polyacetal resin composition having excellent weather
resistance and environment resistance, which suppresses
resin deterioration and discoloration and gloss
reduction caused by bleeding of additives in extended
exposure to light to the utmost and maintains an initial
molded product surface condition.As known well, in recent years, a polyacetal
resin is utilized in a very wide field as an engineering
resin which excels in the physical characteristics such
as a mechanical property and an electrical property and
the chemical characteristics such as a chemical
resistance and a heat resistance. However, expansion of
the field in which the polyacetal resin is utilized is 
accompanied with further requirement of a specific
property to the character thereof as a material in some
cases. Further improvement in a weather (light)
resistance is desired as one of such specific
properties. That is, an environment in which the
interior and exterior parts for automobiles and the
parts for electric appliances are used under sun light,
humidity (rain and bedewing) and other aerial contacting
causes discoloration on a molded product surface and
gloss reduction attributable to loss of a surface
flatness and in addition, generates cracks on the parts
surfaces to cause inconveniences such as damaging the
appearances in some cases. In order to prevent these
defects, it has so far been proposed to add various
weather (light) stabilizers to the polyacetal resin to
improve the weather (light) resistance of the polyacetal
resin. In particular, it is known that combined use of
various UV absorbers and hindered amine series light
stabilizers give an effect to the weather (light)
resistance.However, in order to maintain the weather (light)
resistance over a long period of time, a lot of the
additives described above have to be added. However,
addition in large amounts brings about reduction of a 
mechanical property and provides a problem that in
molding, adhesion and deposition (so-called mold
deposit) on a die generate inferior dimension and poor
appearance of a molded product. Further, in case of the
polyacetal resin, since it is a high crystalline
polymer, the additives are bleeded due to
recrystallization caused by heat and a temperature
difference (bedewing) under an
