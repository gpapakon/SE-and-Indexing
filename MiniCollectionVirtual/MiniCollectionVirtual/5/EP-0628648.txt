<ABSTRACT>
Device for loading the spindles (10) of a bobbin creel (11) with full yarn bobbins (12), having a loading apparatus (13) which attaches the full yarn bobbins (12) of a bobbin stock onto the horizontal spindles (14), arranged one above the other, of a transfer trolley (15)   - which is movable by a travelling drive out of a loading position (27), located next to the creel (11), in a rail-bound manner into bobbin-transfer positions (17) serving for loading the winding stations (15) of this creel (11), - of which the spindles (14) receiving full yarn bobbins (12) form a single vertical spindle row and, in a bobbin-transfer position (17), are in alignment with spindles (10) of the creel (11),   - and which is provided with a bobbin push-over apparatus.   In order to improve a device having the features mentioned in the introduction, in such a way that the bobbin creel can be loaded according to a particular pattern by simple means, the latter is designed so that there can be moved jointly with it by remote control on a bottom rail (21) a tube-removing apparatus (44) having a position of rest (45) which is located on the creel draw-off side and out of which, for the purpose of removing bobbin tubes (46), it can be controlled towards the spindle row (48) which is furthest away from the creel draw-off (47) and from which it can successively remove the bobbin tubes (46) from the winding stations (16) bobbin row by bobbin row, and so that, during the operation of the tube-removing apparatus (44), the transfer trolley (15) can be controlled towards the creel rows free of tubes.

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for the loading of the bobbin pins (10) of 
a spool frame (11) with full yarn spools (12), comprising a 

loading device (13) which pushes the full yarn spools (12) of 
a spool supply onto the horizontal pins (14) of a transfer 

carriage (15) which are arranged above one another, 

the transfer carriage is displaceable on a united rail 
by a travel drive means (23) from a loading position (27) 

adjacent to the frame (11) into spool transfer positions (17) 
serving for the loading at the spool positions (15) of this 

frame (11), 
the pins (14) of the transfer carriage receiving the full 
yarn spools (12) form a single vertical row (18) of pins and 

are in alignment with bobbin pins (10) of the frame (11) in 
a spool transfer position (17), 
and the transfer carriage is provided with a spool 
overthrust device (19), 
 
characterised in that a sleeve removal device (44) is 

displaceable jointly with the apparatus on a base rail (21) 
and is remotely controllable, the sleeve removal device having 

a rest position (45) on the frame withdrawal side, from which 
it is controllable for the removal of bobbin sleeves (46) 

towards the pin row (48) which is most remote from the frame 
withdrawal (47), from which row of pins the sleeves can be 

removed one after another in spool row manner from the spool 
positions (16), and in that the transfer carriage (15) is 

controllable during the operation of the sleeve removal device 
(44) towards the sleeve-free frame rows. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the travel drive means (23) and/or a spool overthrust device 

(19) is or are controllable by a computer which has regard for  
 

spool loading pattern of the frame (11), characterised in that 
the travel drive means of the sleeve removal device (44) also 

is controllable by a computer which has regard for a loading 
pattern of the spool frame (11) for the yarn spools (12). 
Apparatus according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that a length measuring device cooperating with the base rail 

(21) or its toothing is provided for the travel drive means 
(e.g. 23) of the transfer carriage (15) and/or of the sleeve 

removal device (44).
