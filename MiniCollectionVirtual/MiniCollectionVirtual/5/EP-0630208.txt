<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a monitoring device for physical condition, including a wrist-held detector and transmitter unit (1) and at least one separate receiver (2), to which a surveillance message or an alarm is delivered by means of a radio frequency message. The detector means include a sensor (4) for physiological condition and an acceleration sensor (5) which controls a fuzzy logic (7) such that, depending on the movement activity, sliding alarm limits are set for the physical condition sensor (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a wrist-held monitoring device
for independently observing the physical condition of a person
by means of motoric activity and physiological condition, e.g.,
temperature and/or electric conductivity of the skin. The
anomalous condition data is transmitted by conventional
technique on a radio frequency message to one or more
receivers, which either set off a local alarm or the data is
transferred by conventional technique to a centralized
receiving point for alarms. A wrist-mounted pulse rate and body
temperature monitor with means for storing upper and lower
emergency pulse rates and body temperatures by means of which
an emergency situation is defined is known from US-A-48 19 860.
To alert rescue services an emergency signal is generated. A wrist-held device for the independent and on-line
surveillance of movement and physical condition is not yet in
sight. Traditionally, the surveillance has been effected by
using extra-personal sensors, e.g. by monitoring the use of a
door. The problems include a long monitoring time, high
installation costs as well as false alarms as a person under
surveillance leaves the space without switching off the
surveillance. There are also portable radio transmitters
provided with a switch for indicating the posture of a person;
a problem with such devices are false alarms as the user must
remember to take off the device when lying down. Another
problem is that the surveillance is only active when a person
is on his or her feet.Prior known is also monitoring of the
heart, but that does not provide information about motoric
activity and is not suitable for motion control. The heart
monitoring devices are also traditionally expensive and require
a frequent battery replacement and are not suitable for
applications with a lot of users in a restricted area or when a
long-time surveillance is required.An object of the invention is to provide a wrist-watch type of
device, which the carrier wears constantly in his or her wrist
and which monitors physical condition independently and on-line 
as well as issues an alarm upon detecting an abnormal
situation. This object is achieved with the invention as defined in
claim 1. The wrist-held device delivers an alarm, which carries
an ID-code specifying the transmitting device, to a separate
receiver or a plurality of receivers which can even cover an
entire hospital or region. The receivers can be connected to
various local alarms or to an emergency phone. The device may
offer the user a conventional chance

<CLAIMS>
A monitoring device for monitoring physical condition
comprising:


a wrist-held detector and transmitter unit (1), fitted with
first sensor (4) for monitoring physiological conditions

selected from the group consisting of skin temperature, skin
electrical conductivity, and heartbeat rate, and with a radio

transmitter (9) for delivering a surveillance or alarm signal;
the output from

said first sensor (4) including at least two signals,
each representing one of said physiological conditions; 
a receiver unit (2) or receiving a radio signal from said radio
transmitter (9), said receiver unit (2) including a second alarm;

the detector and transmitter unit (1)

further comprising:
a second sensor (5) for monitoring hand movements;
a first counter (7A) for counting pulses delivered by said
second sensor (5); and
a fuzzy logic circuit (7) in electrical communication with
said first sensor (4) and said first counter (7A);

whereby said fuzzy logic circuit (7) monitors said first
sensor (4) and said second sensor (5) such that the output from said

second sensor (5) via said first counter (7A) sets sliding upper and lower alarm
limits,

whereby an alarm is triggered on if one of said two signals
falls outside said sliding alarm limits.
The monitoring device of claim 1 further comprising a
second counter (7B) in electrical communication with said

first sensor (4) and said fuzzy logic circuit (7), said
second counter (7B) capable of switching on said radio transmitter

(9).
The monitoring device of claim 2, further comprising a
pulse detector (6) of said second sensor (5) in electrical 

communication with said first counter (7A) and a third counter
(8), said third counter (8) capable of switching on said radio

transmitter (9) in response to counting a predetermined number
of pulses from said pulse detector (6).
The monitoring device of one of the foregoing claims,
wherein said second sensor (5) is an acceleration sensor.
The monitoring device of claim 4, wherein said second
sensor (5) measures the rate of acceleration of individual hand

movements.
