<ABSTRACT>
An ostomy coupling has one coupling element 10 attachable 
to a medical grade pad and a second coupling element 30 attached 

to a bag or pouch. In such a coupling a stretchable ring or wall 
36 can be shifted ("snapped") by manual pressure between a 

locking position e.g. Figure 4 wherein the two coupling elements 
are locked together and an unlocking position e.g. Figure 5 

wherein the two coupling elements can be separated to permit 
removal of an ostomy bag attached to one or other of the coupling 

elements.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an ostomy coupling. Such couplings are used to attach
a bag for receiving discharged material to a medical grade adhesive pad which
is attached to the wearer's peristomal skin surface.Many designs of such couplings have been made. A large number of these
have been unduly complex and expensive. A few have been simple in design and
fewer still have been simple and effective.European Patent Application No. 286501A shows an ostomy coupling
system in which a rotable lock ring can assume two positions, in one of which
two coupling rings are connected and in the other of which they can be
disconnected.European Patent Application No. 519586 shows a pair of coupling rings,
one of channel form, into which is pushed a non-compressible bulbous insert
having a pivot stem and forming part of the other coupling ring.European Patent Application No. 489017 shows a two piece coupling
system of the general kind shown in EP 519586 or EP 509764. The '017 system
involves two inter-engaging parts of particular shape and design. The intention
is to obtain a remarkable imperviousness between the closure elements of the
male and female coupling elements.European Patent Application No. 629388 (published 21/12/94 claiming a priority of
03/06/93) shows a two-piece ostomy
appliance having a flip-over ring structure (in principle but not in detail similar
to US Patent Application No. 5167651) mounted on a faceplate.Among the characteristics which are desirable in an ostomy coupling are:- 
ease of manipulation, particularly for elderly or infirm
users;the mutual interconnection between the first and second
coupling elements, and hence between the bag and the medical
grade adhesive pad, must be reliable but not require high forces;the overall appliance must have a small thickness and hence
minimise the possible embarrassment due to the appliance
projecting so much that it is visible under clothing; in other
words the "outstand" must be minimised; andmanipulation of the coupling elements must be such that it
is easy to disconnect a bag when it is full and to replace it a
fresh, empty bag.In the Applicants' opinion, no existing design of
ostomy appliance is fully satisfactory under all these headings.
It is an aim of the present invention to provide a particularly
simple yet effective ostomy coupling. Also, ostomy systems
featuring a "locking" mechanism generally employ a third
component. It is believed this application embodies the first
practical "two piece" locking system in an ostomy coupling.According to a

<CLAIMS>
An ostomy coupling which includes a body side coupling element
comprising a flange (10,66,142) from which extends a substantially cylindrical

rib or wall (12, 64, 145), the flange having a medical grade adhesive pad
attached thereto, the rib having a flexible and deflectable seal strip (14, 68, 148),

located radially inwardly thereof, the bag side coupling element having a base
wall (30, 83, 96) attached to a substantially annular wall (32, 64, 94) positioned

for engagement with, and so as to be encircled by, the seal strip (14, 68, 148)
on the body side coupling element, the bag side coupling element also having an

annular outer wall (36, 82, 92) of resilient stretchable synthetic plastics material
which encircles the base wall (30, 83, 96) and is joined to the base wall by an

integral annular plastics hinge (38, 85, 95), whereby in use the said outer wall
(36, 82, 92) acts as a flip-over ring and can be snapped between two limiting

positions by direct finger action, the wall in its first or open position extending generally
outwardly of the base wall (30, 83, 96) and in its second or closed

position being located adjacent to both the flange (10, 66, 142) and the wall (12,
64, 145) of the body side coupling element. 
An ostomy coupling according to claim 1 in which there is at least one
gripping tab (49A, 49B) on the bag side coupling element.
An ostomy coupling according to claim 1 or 2 in which construction is
such that there is a detent or locking relationship existing between an overhang (18)

on the radially outer rim of the substantially cylindrical rib and a step (48) on the
radially inner surface of the outer wall of the bag side coupling element.
An ostomy coupling according to any of claims 1 to 3 and of which one
coupling element is ring-like and has a channel shape in cross section, defined

by radially inner and outer walls and a floor, the element being characterised in
that (i) the floor of the element has a plurality of depressions therein adjacent to

the inner wall, the depressions being equally spaced around the channel, and (ii)
the radially outer wall has a plurality of inwardly-projecting shelf-like roof

portions, equally spaced around the channel and extending partly across the
channel from that part of the outer wall furthest from the floor of said channel.
A bag side coupling element for use in an ostomy coupling, the element
comprising a base wall (30) attached to a substantially annular wall (32), and an annular

outer wall (36) of resilient stretchable synthetic plastics material which encircles the
base wall and is joined to the base wall by an integral annular plastics hinge (38)

whereby in use the said outer wall can be snapped between two limiting
positions.
