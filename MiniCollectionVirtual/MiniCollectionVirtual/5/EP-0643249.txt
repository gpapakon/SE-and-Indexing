<ABSTRACT>
The invention refers to the technical field for 
manufacturing flexible apparatuses for oleo-hydropneumatic 

controls of mechanical members. 
The technical problem to be resolved consist of 
manufacturing with a new process, also matter of 

this invention, a flexible equipement which 
includes metal end joints obtained by cold pressing 

metal portions making up its components. 
The equipment includes a flexible tube (3) with a 
sleeve (2) on the end (c) obtained from a metal 

circular disc (18) in association with a revolving 
nut (7) with linked bushing (8). 
On the other end (d) of the tube (3) is positioned 
the connection (9). 
The manufacturing process concerns respectively the 
end (c) and (d) connections (1) and (9), 

particularly the ring nut (6), the nut (7), the 
bushing (8), the nut (10) and all other components.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns the manufacturing process of connections for a flexible tight
equipment for oleo-hydropneumatic controls of
mechanical members.The equipment includes a flexible tube with
permanent tight connections for coupling the above
mentioned flexible tube to
mechanical members.Various types of connections, pipe unions, hose sockets and other
joints have been suggested in the last years.The prior art connections are disclosed and known in the U.S.
Patent Nos. 4.691.550 and 4.991.876.These prior art connections have met with varying degree of
success but they have found some problems for high pressure
fluid-tight uses.Particularly the U.S.Patent No.4.691.550 discloses a hose socket
making method in which the said socket is placed on the hose and
its shoulder is pressed into a groove.The U.S. Patent No.4.991.876 discloses a connector assembly
according to the preamble of claim 1
for
hot water heaters in which a tubular crimping member crimps the
compression fitting to the hose assembley.The connections described and claimed in the above U.S. Patents
have some inconvenients when high pressure fluid enters in the
circuit for the fluid distribution to the working mechanical
members, because the high pressure can brake the connection
joints.For these reasons it is desirable to provide an improved
manufacturing process which overcomes most of the above
mentioned problems.An improved manufacturing process is provided
which efficiently connects a flexible tight equipment for high
pressure of oleohydropneumatic controls of mechanical members.The manufacturing process relates in particular to the manufacturing of the
sleeve applied on the external layer of the
flexible tube.Concisely, the new manufacturing process of the  
external part or metal sleeve begins by cutting,
using an appropriate press and counter press, an
iron sheet, its thickness being between 2 and 7 mm.
and continuous with the mechanical cold curving by
means of machines, planned and builded especially
for this operation, for the above mentioned part
until an hollow small cylinder is obtained, which
is then moulded (always by cold pressing), by
rolling and stamping.The part or sleeve above mentioned is then applied
and stapled by another appropriate machine which
produces the cold deformation on the flexible tube
pressing it into its internal part or shank,
obtaining a permanent tight coupling, perfectly
sealed.Other processes concerne the manufacturing of the
other components of the flexible equipment such as
ring nuts (with

Manufacturing process of joints or connections (1; 9) at
the ends (c; d) of a flexible tight equipment for

oleohydropneumatic controls of mechanical members, said flexible
tight equipment comprising a flexible tube (3) made up of an

external layer (4) and internal layer (5) in which a metal ring-nut
(6) is inserted, the one end (c) of the tube (3) having a metal

connection (1) with an external sleeve (2) shaped as a right
cylinder (29) or a small cup with a lateral surface (31), a base

(32) with hole (33) and an outlet (34) opened on the opposite end,
said right cylinder (29) or small cup or sleeve (2) being placed and

strongly pressed on the external layer (4) of the flexible tube (3)
containing the ring-nut (6), the tube (3) having on the other

opposite end (d) a metal connection (9) with nut (10) with rotating
threaded bushing or fixed, to be connected to components or

mechanical parts, characterised in that said right cylinder (29) or
small cup is manufactured departing from a sheet-iron belt (11),

obtaining a circular disc (18) therefrom through a stamp operation
using a stamp (16) and a counter stamp (17) and using a shaft

(23) to carry the disc (18) against idle mandrels (27), thus causing
a cold deformation of the disc (18) so that to obtain said right

cylinder (29) or small cup in the form of the sleeve (2). 
Manufacturing process of joints or connections (1; 9) at
the ends (c; d) of a flexible tight equipment for

oleohydropneumatic controls of mechanical members, according to
claim 1, characterised in that said disc (18) is obtained with a

concentric hole (19) by means of a cutter (15), with male stamp
(16) which inserts itself into a female counter-stamp (17) and thus

carrying said disc (18) by means of a shaft (23), with rotatory and
translatory movement along its axis (25), slipping the disc (18) by

means of its circular hole (19) into the segment (24) of the shaft
(23) in normal position until it is brought into forced contact with

the mandrels (27) hinged horizontaly on the vertical support (26)
of the disc curving machine (21), due to the friction of the same on

the above mentioned outlined mandrels (27) obtaining the funelled
upturing of the disc (18) on the shaft (23) in the opposite sense

that of feed thus forming a right cylinder (29) or a small cup
coinciding with the sleeve (2).
