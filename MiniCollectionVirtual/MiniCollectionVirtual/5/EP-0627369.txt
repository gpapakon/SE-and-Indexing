<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to liners 
for cargo containers, and more specifically, to liners for 
containers used to carry bulk cargos. Standardized containers or boxes have come into 
very extensive use for the shipment of freight by land and 
sea, and the many advantages of such containers have made it 
extremely desirable to adapt them for use with as many types 
of cargo as possible. Accordingly, there have been attempts, 
with varying degrees of success, to use conventional 
containers to carry bulk cargo such as dry bulk chemicals, 
powdered and pelletized resins, flour, coffee and grains. When cargo containers are used to carry such bulk 
cargo, it is important that the container itself either be 
kept clean or be cleaned after each load of cargo is emptied 
from the container, so that the container can be subsequently 
used with another load of cargo. Moreover, it is important 
to protect the bulk cargo from contamination and from 
undesirable exposure to the natural elements. For these reasons, large plastic removable liners 
are often used to line the interior walls or surfaces of the 
cargo containers that are used to carry bulk cargo. The 
liner protects the cargo during shipment, for example, from 
rain and debris; and after the cargo is delivered, the liner 
can be removed so that the container is again usable, without 
significant cleaning, to carry other cargo. Various difficulties have been encountered, 
however, in using plastic liners in the above-described 
manner; and in particular, it has been found that the liners  
 
often tear or rupture under certain conditions. For example, 
a cargo container carrying bulk cargo is often emptied by 
opening the rear doors of the container, and raising the 
front end of the container to tilt the container so that the 
cargo slides out the back of the container. Prior art 
container liners often tear or rupture as the cargo slides 
rearward through the container and over the liner. Numerous 
attempts have been made to solve this problem by using braced 
cardboard or wood bulkheads to help support the liner inside 
the container, or by hanging the liner from the container 
roof or walls by means of a multitude of hooks connected to 
the top perimeter of the liner. These prior art attempts 
have not been completely successful, however. It is believed that at least many tears that 
develop in a liner for a cargo container are caused by 
wrinkles in the bottom of the liner. Such wrinkles create 
pockets that trap product inside the
