<ABSTRACT>
Seal in the form of a pair of fastening elements, of which the first exhibits a head (2) and a shank (1) and the second (4) contains a device for connection to the shank (1), one of the elements being provided with a predetermined breaking point. A high degree of reliability in handling and retaining capacity, even after the seal has been broken, is achieved in that the device for connection of the second fastening element to the shank (1) is formed by a resilient clamping plate (6) which is enclosed by the second fastening part (4) and is covered by the latter, on its side directed away from the head (2), and is retained via a predetermined breaking point, on its side directed towards the head (2).

A seal in the form of a pair of fastening elements, 
the first of which has a head (2) and stem (1), and the 

second (4) of which comprises a means (6) for connection 
with the stem (1), wherein one of the elements is provided 

with a predetermined breaking point, wherein the means for 
connection with the stem (1) is formed by a spring-clip disc 

(6) which is enclosed by the second fastening element (4) 
and is covered thereby on its side remote from the head (2) 

and is retained on its side nearest the head (2) via a 
predetermined breaking point (9). 
A seal according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the stem (1) and the seal element (4) are made from plastics 

material. 
A seal according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that the disc-shaped second fastening element (4) includes a 

recess (10) to accommodate the spring-clip disc (6), which 
on its side nearest the head (2) is bounded by a retaining 

member (8) which forms an opening (7) for the passage of the 
stem (1) and engages behind the disc (6) and which is 

connected with the rest of the seal element (4) via 
predetermined breaking points. 
A seal according to Claim 3, characterised in that 
the spring-clip disc (6) can be inserted into the recess 

(10) through a slot which is open towards the narrow side of 
the second fastening element (4). 
A seal according to Claim 4, characterised in that 
the spring-clip disc (6) is held by friction in the recess 

(10) formed by the slot.  
 
A seal according to Claim 4 or 5, characterised in 
that the spring-clip disc (6) is held in the recess (10) by 

elastic form-locking co-operation with the second fastening 
element (4). 
A seal according to any one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that an identification surface (13,14) is 

provided on the head (2) and/or on the second fastening 
element (4).
