<ABSTRACT>
A one-way clutch has a plurality of engagement members 
disposed between an inner ring and an outer ring and spaced 

at regular intervals in a circumferential direction of the 
one-way clutch, an annular retainer (11) having a 

cylindrical part with pockets (12) for receiving the 
engagement members and a flange (13) being continuous from 

an axial end of the cylindrical part and protruding 
radially outwardly, and an annular spring for urging the 

engagement members in a direction of engagement with the 
inner and outer rings. The retainer (11) has at least one 

pair of engagement portions (19) to be engaged with the 
outer ring. The paired engagement portions (19) being 

located substantially symmetrically relative to an axis of 
the retainer (11). Each engagement portion is defined 

between two pockets (12) and between two slits (20) 
respectively connected to the two pockets and passing 

through the flange (13) to the outside of the retainer. 
The flange (13) in each engagement portion (19) has an 

outer radius larger than that of a portion of the flange 
other than the engagement portions and larger than a radius 

of an inner surface of the outer ring.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to one-way clutches 
for use in starters or speed change gears for automobiles, 
or the like. A conventional one-way clutch is shown in Figs. 
5A and 5B. Figs. 5A and 5B are a front view and a cross 
sectional view of the one-way clutch, respectively. As shown in Figs. 5A and 5B, the one-way clutch 
has a plurality of sprags 8 serving as engagement members, 
an inner retainer 5 for retaining radially inner portions 
of the sprags 8, an outer retainer 1 for retaining radially 
outer portions of the sprags, and an annular ribbon spring 
6 for urging the sprags 8 in one direction. The inner 
retainer 5, the outer retainer 1 and the ribbon spring 6 
have generally rectangular pockets spaced at regular 
intervals in the circumferential direction for receiving 
the sprags 8, respectively. The one-way clutch is 
interposed between an inner ring 9 and an outer ring 7 and 
transmits a rotating torque from the inner ring 9 to the  
 
outer ring 7 through the sprags 8 only when the inner ring 
9 rotates in one direction relative to the outer ring 7. Fig. 4A is a partially cut-away front view of the 
outer retainer 1 of the one-way clutch and Fig. 4B is a 
fragmentary side view of the outer retainer 1. As shown in 
these figures, the pockets 2 of the outer retainer 1 are 
formed in a cylindrical part of the outer retainer 1. The 
outer retainer has an outer flange 3 extending radially 
outwardly from an axial end of the cylindrical part. In the outer retainer 1, two slits 10 are 
provided. The slits 10 are connected with pockets 2 
respectively and pass through the flange 3 to the outside 
of the outer retainer 1 such that a portion having a shape 
of generally connected letters of T (referred to as 
"connected-T bar" below) 4 is formed. The connected-T bar 
4 is protruded radially outwardly, so that the distance 
between the center of the flange 3 and a radially outer 
surface of a flange portion 3' of the connected-T bar 4 is 
larger than a radius of an inner surface of the outer ring 
7 where the outer retainer 1 is fitted. By an elastic 
force of the connected-T bar 4 which occurs when the outer 
retainer 1 is placed in position inside the outer ring 7, 
the radially outer surface of the flange portion 3' of the 
connected-T bar 4 is pressed against the inner surface of  
 
the outer ring 7, whereby the outer retainer 1 is fixed to 
the outer ring 7. In the above-described conventional one-way 
clutch, however, the distance from the center of the outer 
flange 3 to the radially

<CLAIMS>
A one-way clutch comprising a plurality of 
engagement members (14) disposed between an inner ring (18) 

and an outer ring (17) and spaced at regular intervals in a 
circumferential direction of the one-way clutch, an annular 

retainer (11) having a cylindrical part with pockets (12) 
for receiving the engagement members (14) and a flange (13) 

being continuous from an axial end of the cylindrical part 
and protruding radially outwardly, and an annular spring 

(16) for urging the engagement members (14) in a direction 
of engagement with the inner and outer rings (18 and 17), 

the retainer (11) having 
engagement portions (19) to be engaged with the outer ring 

(17), each engagement portion 
(19) being defined between two pockets (12) and between two 

slits (20) respectively, the two slits (20) being connected to the two pockets (12) 
and passing through the flange (13) to the outside of the 

retainer (11), the flange (13) in each 
engagement portion (19) having an outer radius larger than 

that of a portion of the flange other than the engagement 
portions and larger than a radius of an inner surface of 

the outer ring (17),
characterized in that
 
said engagement portions (19) being disposed in 

pairs of engagement portions, the engagement portions 
(19) of one pair of engagement portions being 

symmetrically relative to an axis of the retainer 
(11), and the slits (20) defining the engagement 

portions (19) being press-cut slits.
