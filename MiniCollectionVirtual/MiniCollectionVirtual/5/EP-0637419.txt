<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to improvements in the design and construction
of apparatus for dispensing microwaveable hot melt adhesives and other heat sensitive
materials. The apparatus comprises a dispenser which is heated by microwaves and
then used to dispense a material therefrom. The dispenser is specifically designed to
convert microwave energy into heat and to transfer the heat to the material to be
dispensed in a more efficient and/or safe manner. The dispenser is particularly useful
for heating and dispensing a material (e.g. a hot melt adhesive) which is capable of
changing from a solid state or a state of high viscosity to a state of low viscosity
when heated above a predetermined threshold temperature, thereby enabling the
material to be dispensed when in the state of low viscosity. Conventionally, hot melt adhesive was applied using hot melt
adhesive applicators (glue guns). These glue guns were designed to
be connected to a wall socket by an electrical cord and plug for
continuously applying electrical power to the glue gun, thereby
melting the adhesive in the glue gun. This meant that the range over
which the glue gun could physically operate was determined by the
length of the electrical cord coupling the glue gun to the wall
socket. Moreover, the cord at times presented a physical obstacle
for the user to maneuver around when using the glue gun.To solve these problems, a cordless glue gun was designed. A
cordless glue gun is a glue gun that can be detached from its source
of electricity so that it can operate without an electrical cord.
In designing a cordless glue gun, significant attention needs to be
paid to the support structure for the gun. The support structure
must conveniently support the glue gun and enable the glue gun to be
electrically energized (heated) while it is on the support structure.
Moreover, the support structure and the glue gun need to be designed
to enable convenient release of the glue gun from the support
structure and from the source of electricity when it is desired to
use the glue gun. Toward these purposes, the support structure
includes a socket for transmitting electrical energy to the glue gun
and a release mechanism enabling the glue gun to be disconnected from
the socket when it is released from the support structure.Despite the improvements that a cordless glue gun offers over a
conventional glue gun, a cordless glue gun still has drawbacks.
Although the cordless glue gun does not require continuous electrical
power, it must be initially
