<ABSTRACT>
Intermittently-rotating device for supporting lower 
half-molds that can be used in sand core molding machines 

of the type with a vertically movable upper half-mold (10); 
the device is constituted by a prism-shaped structure which 

has flat faces, is internally hollow and is rotatably 
mounted, with preset stops, about a horizontal axis which 

lies at right angles to the direction of movement of the 
casting head (4). A core box (27,28) is mounted on at least 

two oppositely arranged faces of the rotating prism-like 
structure (23) and supports a lower half-mold (32,33) and 

associated plates (28a) for extracting the finished core; 
each one of the lower half-molds (32,33) can be placed in 

succession, upon rotation of the prism-like structure (23), 
at the movable upper half-mold (10) so as to allow, by 

means of a single upper half-mold (10), to mold a core in 
each one of the lower half-molds (32,33) and to 

simultaneously extract the previously finished core from 
the oppositely arranged half-mold (32,33).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a prism-shaped
intermittently-rotating device for supporting, in
equidistant positions, a plurality of lower half-molds of
the type used in automatic sand core molding machines in
order to allow, with a single upper half-mold, to expel one
or more finished cores simultaneously with the molding of
another core.As is known, for example from US-A-4 204 569, sand
core molding machines use openable molds, i.e. molds
constituted by two half-molds arranged opposite to each
other in a vertical direction and mounted on supports so
that they can be closed by mating, in such a manner that
they can be filled with sand, which is cast or injected
under pressure through a casting head, and are subsequently
opened, normally by spacing one of said half-molds with
respect to the other one, in order to allow extraction of
the molded core.The lower half-molds are generally supported by a box-like
containment body, commonly termed "core box", which is
supported by a quadrangular plate and is removably anchored
thereto: said plate has, in its peripheral region, a raised
border which has a quadrangular cross-section, so as to
form a flat frame for the support and anchoring of the core
box; said frame is essentially formed by supporting plates
which have a limited width.In all sand core molding machines that use an upper
half-mold movable toward and away from the corresponding
half-mold which is mounted in fixed position on the core
box, after molding and consequent degassing in a known 
manner, the upper half-mold is raised, whereas the core,
formed in the lower fixed half-mold and partially
protruding from the edge of said half-mold, is raised and
extracted from the half-mold by means of extractor pins
which are carried by two extraction plates actuated in a
vertical direction by a hydraulic cylinder. The core is
then gripped by clamps or the like and then moved laterally
and immersed in a deburring tank or in other devices
capable of eliminating burr. The core, thus cleaned, is
then removed on trolleys or the like.In practice, this method of operation entails
considerable downtimes between one molding operation and
the next. This is due to the need to extract the core when
the machine is not moving and to remove said core from the
fixed half-mold, and is also due to the time required to
close the upper half-mold on the lower half-mold before
performing the subsequent casting of the molding sand.
Furthermore, the finished core must be extracted with
particular care, and its removal requires

Intermittently-rotating device for supporting lower
half-molds, which can be used in sand core molding machines

of the type having a movable casting head (4) and an upper
half-mold (10) that can move vertically with respect to a

lower half-mold (32,33), characterized in that it comprises
a prism-shaped structure (23) which has flat faces, is

internally hollow and rotatably mounted with preset stops,
about a horizontal axis which lies at right angles to the

direction of movement of said casting head (4); a core box
(27,28) being mounted on each of at least two oppositely

arranged faces of said rotating prism-shaped structure,
each core box supporting a lower half-mold (32,33) and

associated plates (28a) for extracting the finished core;
each one of said lower half-molds (32,33) being arrangeable

in succession, upon rotation of said prism-shaped
structure, at the movable upper half-mold so as to allow,

by means of a single upper half-mold, to mold a core in
each one of said lower half-molds and to simultaneously

extract the previously finished core from the oppositely
arranged half-mold.
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that
said prism-shaped structure (23) with flat faces is shaped

like an internally hollow cubic body that has, on two
opposite faces, aligned shafts (24,24a) which protrude

centrally therefrom, said shafts being mounted so that they
can rotate freely within bearings (25,25a,26,26a) which are

accommodated in the uprights (1,1a) of the molding machine,
said prism-shaped structure (23) being rotated by means of 

a rack (37) meshing with a gear (36) which is rigidly
associated with one of said shafts and is made to move in a

reciprocating manner by means of a hydraulic cylinder (38)
so as to cause said prism-shaped structure (23) to rotate

in successive steps with a stop every 180Â°, i.e. when a
lower half-mold (32,33) is arranged opposite to the upper

half-mold (10) and thus in unloading position.
Device according to any one or more of the
preceding claims, characterized in that a conventional core

box (27,28) is located on at least two of the faces of the
prism-shaped structure (23) which are parallel to the

rotation axis thereof, a lower half-mold (32,33) being
removably locked to said core box, conventional plates

(28a) with extractor pins and associated guides (29,29a)
being provided at the base of said lower half-mold, each

one of said plates being actuated by a hydraulic cylinder
(30,30a), said hydraulic cylinders being accommodated in

mutually opposite positions inside the cavity of said
prism-shaped structure.
Device according to any one or more of the
preceding claims, characterized in that it has, in

combination with said prism-shaped structure (23), a roller
conveyor (39,40,42) with parallel shafts (39) with rollers (40) that

support a conventional resting surface or pallet for
accommodating the finished core after expulsion from an

inverted half-mold (32,33), the rollers of said roller
conveyor being driven by a hydraulic motor (41) while the

frame (42), together with the roller conveyor and associated
motor, can be raised toward and away from said inverted

half-mold in a reciprocating manner by means of hydraulic 
cylinders (43) or the like.
Device according to claim 4, characterized in that
a similar roller conveyor (45) is provided laterally to

said roller conveyor (39,40,42) and accommodates the pallet with the
finished core that is pushed by the rollers of said first

roller conveyor, said lateral roller conveyor (45) being also
movable vertically up and down by means of hydraulic

cylinders to allow to place the core laterally to
conventional automatic removal devices.
Device according to claim 2, characterized in that
said shafts (24,24a) provided for the rotation of said

prism-shaped structure (23) are axially hollow to allow to
remove by aspiration the noxious gases, solvents and the

like which are present inside the cavity of said prism-shaped
structure.
