<ABSTRACT>
The device for suction and storage of waste includes a casing (3) which, on the one hand, comprises waste storage means and at least one separation compartment (6), the lower part of which is open and opens onto the waste storage means, and which, on the other hand, is equipped with ventilation means and includes a waste introduction opening and an air evacuation opening (15). According to the invention, the ventilation means consist of at least a first fan (5) which is placed inside the casing (3), the intake orifice (8) of which fan is connected, towards the exterior of the casing (3), to a waste collection conduit, and the delivery orifice (7) of which fan opens into the upper part (6a) of the separation compartment (6), so that the air flow delivered by the first fan (5) is projected substantially horizontally into the separation compartment (6); the device furthermore comprises a grille (9) for separating air and waste, which grille is interposed between the separation compartment (6) and the evacuation opening (15) of the casing (3), and which is inclined downwards from the delivery orifice (7) of the first fan (5).

Waste suction and storage device, including a box 
(3) which, on the one hand, comprises waste storage means 

and at least one separation compartment (6) whose lower 
part is open and connects with the waste storage means 

and which, on the other hand, is equipped with 
ventilation means and includes a waste introduction 

opening and an air discharge opening (15), characterized, 
on the one hand, in that the ventilation means consists 

at least of a first fan (5) which is placed inside the 
box (3), has its suction orifice (8) connected, towards 

the outside of the box (3), to a waste collection pipe 
and has its delivery orifice (7) leading into the upper 

part (6
a
) of the separation compartment (6) so that the 
air flow delivered by the first fan (5) is projected 

substantially horizontally into the separation 
compartment (6) and, on the other hand, in that the 

device furthermore comprises a grille (9), for separation 
of air and waste, which is interposed between the 

separation compartment (6) and the discharge opening (15) 
of the box (3), and which is inclined downwards from the 

delivery orifice (7) of the first fan (5). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the first fan (5) is provided with blades so as to 

obtain shredding of the waste at the entry of the 
separation compartment (6). 
Device according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the box (3) furthermore comprises a filtration 

compartment (13) which is located above the separation 
compartment (6) and a filtration system (14) which is 

placed in the filtration compartment (13), between the 
separation grille (9) and the discharge opening (15) of 

the box (3). 
Device according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the filtration system (14) consists of a dust bag 

(6) [sic] which is placed just above the separation 

compartment (6) and which is provided with vibration 
means, in that the grille (9) can be retracted from its 

normal position to a second position in which it is no  
 

longer interposed between the two compartments (6,13) for 
separation and filtration. 
Device according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that the grille (9) is retracted by pivoting it about a 

horizontal axle (10) which is integral with the edge of 
the grille (9) and which is located towards the upper 

part of the delivery orifice (7), the grille then being 
placed along one of the inner faces of the separation 

compartment (6), adjoining the first fan (5). 
Device according to Claim 4 or 5, characterized 
in that the dust bag (16) is fixed on a support frame 

(17) and the vibration means consist of a handle (20) 
which is accessible from outside the box (3) and of 

rubber pads (19) on which the said frame (17) is mounted 
and which can be subjected to repeated displacements by 

actuation of the handle (20). 
Device according to Claims 1 to 6, characterized 
in that the storage means consists of a waste container 

(22) which is located in the box (3), below the 
separation compartment (6) and in that the said device 

includes connection means between the open face of the 
separation compartment and the opening of the container, 

the box having an access hatch facing the container (22). 
Device according to Claims 1 to 6, characterized 
in that the lower face of the separation compartment (6) 

connects with the storage means via a compacting screw 
(24) accommodated in the lower part of the box (3), so 

that its feed opening (27) is connected onto the open 
face of the separation compartment (6) and its discharge 

opening (31) emerges onto the storage means. 
Device according to Claim 8, characterized in 
that the discharge opening (31) of the compacting screw 

(24) emerges from the box (3) through an orifice around 
which an annular part (32) for fastening the storage 

means is placed, externally to the said box (3). 
Device according to Claim 9, characterized in 
that, the storage means consisting of a plastic bag (33) 

fixed onto the annular part (32), outside the box (3), it 
includes:  

 

a) at least one shutoff contactor (35) whose finger (36), 
forming a switch, passes through the said annular part 

(32) and projects above it, and 
b) at least one pivoting bar (39) which is arranged above 
the said finger (36) and the annular part (32), 

so that, when the bag (33) is placed around the annular 
part (32), this bag (33) is placed above the pivoting bar 

(36) and, when the bag (33) is being fastened using a 
fastening tie (34), such as a strap, the bar (36) pushes 

in the finger (36) of the contactor (35) by pivoting 

under the tightening action of the tie. 
Device according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that it comprises additional ventilation means which 

are connected to the discharge opening (15) of the box 
and which makes it possible to discharge the air 

contained in the box (3) with a flow rate which is 
sufficient to compensate at least partly for an 

overpressure inside the box (3). 
Device according to Claim 11, characterized in 
that the additional ventilation means consists of a 

second fan (44) which is fixed in the box (3) at the 
level of the discharge opening (15), which discharge 

opening is equipped with an air flow-rate regulation 
means of the graduated ring type (45). 
Device according to one of Claims 1, 2, 11 or 12, 
characterized in that the lower face of the separation 

compartment (6) connects onto a baling press which is 
accommodated in the lower part of the box (3) so that its 

feed opening is connected onto the open face of the 
separation compartment (6) and which acts as storage 

means.
