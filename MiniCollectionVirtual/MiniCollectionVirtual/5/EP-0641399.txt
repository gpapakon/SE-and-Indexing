<ABSTRACT>
Fibre or film of water-absorbent water-insoluble fibrous material has a matrix of a cross-linked copolymer formed from 50 to 95 % by weight of ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic monomer and 5 to 50 % by weight of copolymerisable ethylenically unsaturated monomer. The matrix contains regions of a dispersed polymeric material, the matrix copolymer and the dispersed polymeric material being mutually immiscible and chemically substantially non-reactive under ambient conditions. The fibre or film can be produced by extruding a solution or dispersion of the polymeric material in a solution of the matrix copolymer in its non-cross-linked state into a gaseous environment.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Fibre and FilmTechnical FieldThis invention relates to fibre and film of water absorbent water-insoluble material. Water-absorbent water- insoluble materials are of use in many absorbent products, particularly products for absorbing aqueous body fluids such as baby diapers, incontinence pads, sanitary napkins and tampons, and in wiping materials for mopping up spills of aqueous fluids. Most water-absorbent water-insoluble materials are available only in powder form. There are problems in retaining an absorbent powder in the desired position in the absorbent product, for example in diapers. Fibre, whether staple fibre or continuous filaments, can be more effectively retained in position by incorporation in a fabric, and fibre or film can also be effectively retained in position in other products.Background ArtEP-A-268498 describes a water-absorbent water-insoluble polymeric fibre, film, coating, bonding layer or foam, made by forming a substantially linear polymer of water-soluble ethylenically unsaturated monomer blends comprising carboxylic and hydroxylic monomers and then reacting the carboxylic and hydroxylic monomers in the linear polymer to form internal crosslinks within the polymer.EP-A-269393 describes a water-absorbent water-insoluble crosslinked polymer fibre or film made by dry extrusion of a solution of a substantially linear polymer formed from a water-soluble blend of monoethylenically unsaturated monomers comprising a plasticising monomer and evaporation of the solvent. The fibre or film is further plasticised, stretched and then crosslinked. 

 EP-A-342919 describes film or fibre made by extrusion and stretching from a polymer of water-soluble ethylenically unsaturated monomers that include ionic monomer. A counterionic lubricant compound is absorbed into the surface of the fibre or film before or during the stretching.EP-A-397410 describes a water-soluble linear polymer of carboxylic acid monomers such as acrylic acid and a hydroxylic monomer which can be crosslinked, after being shaped by extrusion of an aqueous solution of the polymer as fibres or film, to form crosslinks between the carboxyl and hydroxyl groups.GB-A-2082614 describes a dry, solid, water-swellable absorbent comprising a blend of a water-insoluble absorbent polymer, which may be a covalently crosslinked or ionically complexed anionic polyelectrolyte, and an extender material selected from the group consisting of uncrosslinked derivatives, starch, montmorillonite clay, attapulgite clay, seracite, talc, kaolin, silica
