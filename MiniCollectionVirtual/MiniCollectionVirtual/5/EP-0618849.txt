<ABSTRACT>
Oxide-free metallic, alloy or intermetallic compound formed by coating a powder of at least one member selected from the group consisting of elemental metallic, alloy and intermetallic compound with an oxide-replacing metal. The oxide-free compound may be compacted without the addition of a liquid sintering agent and at temperatures below the melting point of the compound, under sufficient pressure to form a uniform, consolidated intermetallic body.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PROCESS FOR FORMING ALLOYS IN SITU IN ABSENCE OF LIQUID-PHASE SINTERINGFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe invention relates to a process of forming intermetallic alloys. In a preferred embodiment, the invention relates to processes for forming the interme¬ tallic alloys as in situ dental restorations.BACKGROUND Amalgams and related alloys have been incorporated into a variety of commercial applications and thus a number of processes for producing such amalgams are known. For example, U.S. Patent No. 4,664,855 discloses a univer¬ sally employed process which triturates elemental metal- lies or an intermetallic alloy, in the form of comminuted filings or atomized spherical powders, with the sintering agent mercury and compacts the resulting amalgam into a uniform, consolidated intermetallic alloy. The process may be considered a combination of liquid phase and reactive metal sintering. The finely comminuted metallic or intermetallic powders react with the Hg and when pres¬ sure is applied to the reaction product, form a compact, high density mass. U.S. Patent No. 3,933,961 discloses a process for preparing a pre-weighed alloy tablet of uniform weight which is then triturated with a weighed quantity of Hg to form a traditional amalgam alloy.Metallic powders have two basic forms: 1) minute lathe-cut filings and 2) atomized, spherical particles. Lathe-cut filings are subsequently milled and sifted to produce the desired particle size. The length of parti- cles in a commercial lathe-cut alloy might range from 60- 120μm long, 10-70μm wide and from 10-35μm thick. On the other hand, spherical particles, produced by means of an atomizing process whereby a spray of tiny drops is allowed to solidify in an inert gaseous (e.g., argon) or liquid (e.g., water) environment, have a maximum size between 40 and 50μm (Dental Amalgams, William J. O'Brien, Ph.D., Quintessence Publishing Co., 1989, at p. 264, 266). 

 For more than 150 years, dental practitioners have applied a Ag-Sn system and related intermetallic alloys as dental amalgam preparations for use in dental restorations such as fillings and prostheses. The amalgamation reac- tion which forms Ag-Sn dental preparations is best repre¬ sented below (Dental Materials, supra, at p. 269);Ag3Sn + Hg ► Ag2Hg3 + Sn7Hg + Ag3Sn; orgamma + Hg ► gamma 1 + gamma 2 •+- gamma(residual) .After completion of the amalgamation reaction, the high-melting Ag3Sn (gamma) products are embedded in a matrix of mercury reaction products. Both the Ag2Hg3 (gamma 1) and Sn7Hg (gamma 2) phases form a
