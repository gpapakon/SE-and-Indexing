<ABSTRACT>
In an improved postage scales system, soft-selection 
keys are used for selecting options including shipping 

service options provided by the system. The soft keys 
are multi-function, being assigned a function according 

to previous selections input through the soft keys. A 
changeable indication of the function of each soft key 

appears on teh screen in alignment therewith. The system 
is capable of interfacing and communicating with other 

devices such as a printer, a remote computer, an optical 
scanner, an integrated circuit (IC) card, etc. Certain 

data and code for use in the system can be updated by 
downloading new data and code from IC cards to the 

system. A security measure is instituted such that, 
after an update of the data or code, a system user is 

required to enter a valid authorization number in order 
to enable the system. Such a measure is, in part, 

necessary for deterring unauthorized copying of software 
of the system onto another similar system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electronic scale
system and method.In recent years, multifarious postage scales
incorporating digital circuitry and microprocessors have
been developed. These specialized postage scales are
typically equipped with means of weighing packages
including letters and parcels, and are capable of
combining the weight and the shipping rate information
stored therein to determine the postage and other charges
for shipment of the packages.Many of the electronic scales are also equipped with
means of displaying the weight of a package, along with
the postage and other shipping charges during the
weighing process. For aesthetic reasons, the display
screens of such scales are compact and relatively small.
As such, the amount of information displayed on one such
screen is extremely limited.The shipping cost for a package to be delivered to
a destination is dependent upon not only the weight of
the package, but also the particular carrier used, the
destination zone, the class of shipment, and the selected
service options. In the United States, carriers such as
the United States Postal Service (USPS), United Parcel
Service (UPS) and Federal Express each have independent,
different postage rates and charges for different service
options. For example, USPS has various rates for first,
second and third mailing classes, parcel post service,
priority mail service, book rate service, etc. UPS
levies extra charges for service options such as Collect
on Delivery (COD), Delivery Confirmation Response (DCR),
Declared Value (DV) and the like.Because of the existence of the many different
carriers and their associated rates and charges, the
amount of data to be stored in electronic scales is 
substantial, and normally requires a dedicated memory in the form of a
programmable read-only memory (PROM). However, whenever there is
a change in the postage rates, or other cost factors, such memory needs to
be replaced by an updated memory. The replacement undesirably calls
for the service of a technician to disassemble the scales to physically
remove the existing memory inside.Because of the many different rates and service options involved,
the operating portion of an electronic postage scales normally includes
many keys, each of which corresponds to a rate or a service option. The
size of the operating portion is accordingly large and the presentation of
the keys is confusing. The large keyboard would intimidate unskilled
operators and leads to errors during a complicated operation. Attempts

An electronic scale system comprising:

a system memory (250)
a weight evaluator (11) for determining the weight of a package to
be shipped via a selected service, characterised by:
a first receiver (261) for receiving an integrated circuit card (401)
having a card memory (403, 405);
an interface within said first receiver for transferring data and
information identifying said data between said card memory and said

system memory;
a second receiver (17, 230) for receiving an authorisation code
