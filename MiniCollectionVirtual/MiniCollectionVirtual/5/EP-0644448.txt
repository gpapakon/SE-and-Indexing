amplitude of acoustic resonances is provided. Acoustic 

energy is efficiently removed from the electro-optic

acoustically matched to the electro-optic crystal, that is, 

materials that have acoustic impedances within ±15% of that 
of the electro-optic material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved electro-optic 
modulator for reducing the amplitude of crystal resonance. 
Acoustic energy is efficiently removed from the 
crystal by the acoustically matched electrodes and side 
bars where it is dissipated by scattering and absorption. All wideband frequency modulated (FM) chirped CO₂ lasers 
exhibit pronounced amplitude modulation (AM), as a 
side effect to the desired FM modulation. Excitation of 
the FM electro-optic modulator crystal's acoustic resonance 
is one of the drivers of the AM modulation. Reduction of 
the crystal's resonance amplitude will directly reduce the 
unwanted AM modulation. Some solid state lasers having high repetition rate 
solid state Q-switches also suffer from acoustic oscillation, 
causing the switch to ring open when it should be 
shut. Prior to the present invention, copper was used as the 
electrode material and alumina (Al₂O₃) or beryllia (BeO) was 
used as a side bar material (electrically, it works as an 
insulator) in many CdTe electro-optic modulators. Indium 
was also used between the electro-optic modulator crystal 
and the electrodes to fill up any surface irregularities 
that improve the acoustic coupling between electrodes and 
CdTe crystal. These materials do not exhibit acoustic impedances 
which closely match that of electro-optic modulator's 
CdTe crystal and therefore contribute to an increase  
 
in the amplitude of the electro-optic crystal's acoustic 
resonance. Two references that exemplify the use of intracavity 
CdTe modulators for CO₂ lasers are: R.L. Shoemaker et al, 
"Frequency-switchable CO₂ laser: design and performance", 
Applied Optics, Vol. 21, No. 5, pp. 961-966 (1 March 1982) 
and J.E. Kiefer et al, "Intracavity CdTe Modulators for CO₂ 
Lasers", IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics, Vol. QE-8, 
No. 2, pp. 173-179 (February 1972). An electro-optic crystal must be damped in some manner 
to reduce the amplitude of the acoustic resonances. This 
must be done for a variety of reasons. The crystal can actually 
fracture under some circumstances if it is not properly 
damped. Less catastrophic though often vital, the 
crystal will ring at its natural resonance, giving rise to 
many problems. These include leakage through an electro-optic 
shutter, unwanted lasing spikes, frequency chirping, 
and other effects. Thus, a need exists for an improved electro-optic modulator 
that minimizes the above-mentioned disadvantages. In accordance with the invention, an improved electro-optic 
modulator is provided
