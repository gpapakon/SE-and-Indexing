<ABSTRACT>
The attributes of an image are classified, and 
optimal processing for each attribute is performed, 

thereby improving the overall quality of the image. 
When this processing method is applied to a copying 

machine, a high processing efficiency can be realized, 
and an area designating operation can be omitted. An 

image processing apparatus of the invention is 
characterized by including a block selection processing 

unit for classifying images stored in a storage unit 
according to various attributes and providing area 

information for each attribute.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image
processing apparatus having a function of classifying
input images according to various attributes (or
attribution), and an image processing method.Conventionally, in extracting a certain portion
(e.g., a photograph portion or a table portion) from an
image, the portion is manually designated by using an
editor or the like.In addition, the attributes of an image are
classified as two portions, i.e., a photograph portion
and a character portion, and methods such as image
processing methods are variably used.Extraction of a portion of a given attribute from
an image, however, requires a cumbersome manual
operation. In addition, since the attributes of an
image can only be classified as a photograph portion and a
character portion, finer processing corresponding to
each attribute of the image cannot be performed.Especially, attributes cannot be automatically
classified. For this reason, edit processing in, e.g.,
a copying machine is complicated. Classification of attributes is disclosed in
U.S. Patent Application Serial Nos. 771,220 (filed on
October 4, 1991), 787,615 (filed on November 4, 1991),
832,594 (filed on February 7, 1992), 832,725 (filed on
February 7, 1992), and 873,012 (filed on April 24,
1992), and U.S. Patent No. 5,303,381 issued on April
12, 1994.There is, however, room for improvement in
application to a copying machine.Especially, there is room for improvement in
operability and apparatus arrangement.The present invention has been made in
consideration of the above situation, and has as a
concern to provide an image processing apparatus and
method which can efficiently edit image data. European Patent Specification No EP-A-0415373
discloses a document reader having a scanner and means
for analysing the layout of the data read by the scanner.
In response to the analysis the image data is divided
into blocks and the order in which characters can be read
from the blocks for display can be varied by manual input
means.According to the present invention, there is
provided a copying apparatus as set out in claim 1.The above and other features, and advantages of the
present invention will be apparent from the following
detailed description in conjunction with the accompanying
drawings and the appended claims. Fig. 1 is a block diagram showing the overall
arrangement of an image forming apparatus;Fig. 2 is a sectional view showing a reader unit 1
and a printer unit 2;Fig. 3 is a block diagram showing an image
processing unit in the reader unit 2;Fig. 4 is
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A copying apparatus comprising:

means (1) for converting an object image into an
image signal;
display means (125) for displaying to an operator
instruction information concerning the operation of said

copying apparatus; and
means (9) for discriminating between a character
area and a non-character area of the object image on the

basis of the image signal;

   
characterised by
:

means for displaying as a graphical visual image on

said display means (125) at least a character area or a
non-character area as discriminated by said

discrimination means,
editing means (128-134) for performing mutually
different editing processes on a character area and a

non-character area as displayed by said display means as
a graphical visual image; and
means (2) for forming an image based on the output
of said editing means.
Apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said
displaying means is arranged on an operation panel of 

a copying apparatus.
Apparatus according to claim 2, wherein the panel is
a liquid crystal display panel and the editing means

comprise a plurality of touch areas on said panel.
Apparatus according to any preceding claim, wherein
said converting means (1) is a flat bed scanner.
Apparatus according to any preceding claim, wherein
said discriminating means is adapted to discriminate

between a character area and a non-character area by
detecting edges of the object image.
Apparatus according to any preceding claim, wherein
said editing processing includes variable magnification

processing of a discriminated area.
Apparatus according to any preceding claim, wherein
said editing means is adapted to reduce areas other than

an area discriminated as a character.
Apparatus according to any preceding claim, wherein
said editing means is adapted to enlarge an area

discriminated as a character.
