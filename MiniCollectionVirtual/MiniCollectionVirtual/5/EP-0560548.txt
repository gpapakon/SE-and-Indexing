<ABSTRACT>
A power control circuit for use in radio 
transmitters such as portable telephone sets. The circuit 

comprises a power amplifier for amplifying in terms of power 
a transmission signal to obtain an output signal; control 

circuits (35-37) for controlling the amplitude of the signal output (S13) 
by the power amplifier (13); a limiter (41) for partially limiting the 

amplitude of the signal from the power amplifier (13) in order to 
obtain an output signal; a multiplication circuit (42) for 

multiplying the output signal from the limiter (41) and part of 
the signal from the power amplifier (13) in order to acquire an 

output signal (S13); a low-pass filter (44) for extracting a DC 
component (V44) of the output signal (S42) from the multiplication 

circuit (42); and a comparison circuit (33) for comparing the DC 
component (V44) from the low-pass filter with a reference voltage 

(V32) in order to obtain a comparison output (S33). The comparison 
output (S32) from the comparison circuit (33) is supplied to the 

control circuits (35-37), and the control circuits control the level 
of the signal (S13) from the power amplifier (13) so that the DC 

component (V44) from the low-pass filter (44) will become equal to the 
reference voltage (V32) regardless of temperature change.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a power control 
circuit for use in radio transmitters such as portable 
telephone sets. In movable telephone systems such as a cellular 
phone system, it is the base station that controls or 
changes the transmission output of each of the mobile 
stations configured. This scheme is adopted so that the 
distance of radio transmissions stemming from each mobile 
station may be minimized and that the same frequency may be 
used by different mobile stations in different locations 
without interference therebetween. This allows the system 
to accommodate under its control the largest possible number 
of mobile stations that may communicate with one another. To have its transmission output changed 
externally, the mobile station employs a transmission output 
section shown illustratively in Fig. 4. In Fig. 4, 
reference numeral 11 is a microphone; 12 is a transmission 
circuit; 13 is a power amplifier; 14 is a microstrip line; 
15 is a band-pass filter for an outgoing channel; and 16 is 
a transmitter-receiver antenna. During a transmission, a voice signal Sll from the 
microphone 11 is fed to the transmission circuit 12. The 
transmission circuit 12 converts the voice signal Sll to an 
outgoing channel transmission signal (FM signal) S12. The 
transmission signal S12 is amplified in power by the power 
amplifier 13 to become a signal S13. The power-amplified 
signal S13 passes through the microstrip line 14 and a 
filter 15 before reaching the antenna 16. From the antenna 
16, the signal is transmitted by radio to the base station. Reference numeral 20 represents a microcomputer 
for system control. The microcomputer 20 receives from the 
base station predetermined command signals or data via the 
transmission circuit 12 and via a reception circuit, not  
 
shown. In turn, these command signals or data allow the 
microcomputer 20 to control the transmission circuit 12 and 
the reception circuit. Reference numeral 30 represents an APC circuit 
that controls the transmission output. In operation, the 
microcomputer 20 loads into a latch circuit 31 data D31 for 
designating the transmission output. From the latch circuit 
31, the data D31 are sent to a D/A converter 32 for 
conversion to an analog voltage V32. The voltage V32 is 
supplied to a voltage comparison circuit 33 as the reference 
voltage. The signal S13 from the power amplifier 13 is sent 
to a detection circuit 34. This causes a DC voltage V34 to 
be output, the level of the voltage V34 corresponding to the 
level
