<ABSTRACT>
The reduction in wall deposits in reaction containers (reactors) in the suspension polymerisation of monomers containing acrylic and/or methacrylic groups, and the use of a buffer and a dispersant to reduce wall deposits in reaction containers in the suspension polymerisation of monomers containing acrylic and/or methacrylic groups.

<CLAIMS>
A process for reducing the wall coating in reaction containers 
in the suspension polymerization of monomers containing 

acrylate and/or methacrylate groups, wherein the polymerization 
is carried out in the presence of a buffer selected 

from the group consisting of citric acid, alkali metal 
citrates, alkaline earth metal citrates and ammonium citrates, 

and of a dispersant, a part of the dispersant being 
added only when the polymerization has progressed, and a copolymer 

obtainable from methacrylic acid and a C
1
-C
4
-alkyl 
ester of methacrylic acid being used as the dispersant. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the dispersant used 
is a copolymer obtainable from 50-90 % by weight of methacrylic 

acid and 10-50 % by weight of methyl methacrylate and/ 
or an alkali metal salt thereof. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein from 5 to 30 % 
by weight of the dispersant are added at a monomer conversion 

of from 20 to 80 % of the most rapidly reacting monomer. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, wherein the reaction 
container used is an enameled stainless steel container. 
The use of a buffer and of a dispersant as claimed in claim 1 
for reducing the wall coating in rection containers in the 

suspension polymerization of monomers containing acrylate 
and/or methacrylate groups.
