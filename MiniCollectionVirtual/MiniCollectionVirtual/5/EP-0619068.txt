<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a displaceable feeding fence. 
This feeding fence (1) comprises an elongate frame (2), a fence (3) 

arranged on the frame (2) with a number of passage openings (4) for 
the head (5) of an animal, and support and guide means connected 

to the frame which support and guide the frame such that it 
can be displaced transversely of its longitudinal direction 

forward and backward through a stroke length over a ground 
surface. The feeding fence (1) further comprises a mat (10) of 

flexible material which is connected to the frame (2) with a 
longitudinal edge (11) over the length of the fence and which is 

connected to the floor with an opposite longitudinal edge (12). 
In the fully advanced position the mat (10) extends over the 

floor surface to the rear of the frame.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a displaceable feeding fence 
comprising an elongate frame, a fence arranged on the frame 
with a number of passage openings for the head of an animal, 
and support and guide means connected to the frame which 
support and guide the frame such that it can be displaced 
transversely of its longitudinal direction forward and 
backward through a stroke length over a ground surface. Such a displaceable feeding fence is known from EP-A-61817 
and EP-A-397 357 and is used in an animal stall. A 
quantity of fodder such as silage blocks is placed in front 
of the feeding fence. The animals can reach the fodder via 
the passage openings. The fence is regularly displaced by 
drive means or by the animals themselves pushing the fence 
forward so that the whole quantity of arranged fodder can be 
successively consumed. Once the arranged fodder has been consumed, the fence 
is moved back and a fresh quantity of fodder is placed, 
whereafter the cycle is repeated. It has been found in practice that the animals take up 
more bulk fodder with his manner of feeding, which is 
favourable for efficient management. With the displaceable feeding fence according to the 
invention characterized in claim 1 a further improvement is 
obtained in the take-up of bulk fodder. The mat employed 
according to the invention prevents the floor surface being 
dirtied by excreta. The floor surface on which the animals 
stand in the advanced position of the feeding fence is the 
same surface from which the animals feed in the moved back 
position of the feeding fence. In the feeding fence  
 
according to the invention the animals do not therefore have 
to take up fodder from a floor dirtied with manure as with 
the prior art devices known from the mentioned publications. 
It has been found that cattle have an aversion to fodder 
lying on a surface dirtied with manure and thus consume less 
thereof than is desirable. This drawback is obviated with 
the invention. A simple embodiment of the feeding fence according to 
the invention is characterized in claim 2. In the moved back 
position of the feeding fence the mat is folded beneath the 
frame, and in the advanced position the mat extends rearward 
from the frame. In order to prevent the animals destroying the mat with 
their stamping or the mat obstructing the proper movement of 
the feeding fence the step of claim 3 is preferably applied. A suitable embodiment of the tensioning means is herein 
characterized in claim 4. A very favourable embodiment of 
the

<CLAIMS>
Displaceable feeding fence (1) comprising an 
elongate frame (2), a fence (3) arranged on the frame with a 

number of passage openings (4) for the head (5) of an 
animal, support and guide means (6, 7) connected to the 

frame which support and guide the frame such that it can be 
displaced transversely of its longitudinal direction forward 

and backward through a stroke length (8) over a ground 
surface, 
characterized by
 a mat (10) of flexible material 
which is connected to the frame (2) with a longitudinal edge 

(11) over the length of the fence and which is connected to 
the floor with an opposite longitudinal edge (12) such that 

in the fully advanced position the mat extends to the rear 
of the frame (2). 
Displaceable feeding fence as claimed in claim 1, 
wherein the mat (10) has a width substantially equal to half 

the stroke length (8) and is fixed to the frame (2) at a 
distance equal to this width rearwardly of a leading edge 

thereof. 
Displaceable feeding fence as claimed in any of the 
foregoing claims, wherein tensioning means (44, 47) engaging 

on the mat are arranged on the frame (41) for holding 
tensioned along the floor surface a part of the mat (42) 

extending to the rear of the frame. 
Displaceable feeding fence as claimed in claim 3, 
wherein the tensioning means comprise an elongate gripping 

member for the mat guided slidably on the frame and urging 
means loading the member in the direction tensioning the 

mat. 
Displaceable feeding fence as claimed in claim 3, 
wherein the tensioning means comprise rolling-up means (33, 

54) which grip the end of the mat connected to the frame.  
 
Displaceable feeding fence as claimed in claim 5, 
wherein the rolling-up means comprise a drive device (57). 
Displaceable feeding fence as claimed in any of the 
foregoing claims, wherein the frame bears a scraping edge 

(36) making contact with the upper side of the mat.
