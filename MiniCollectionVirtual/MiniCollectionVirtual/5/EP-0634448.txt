<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use as vulcanization
accelerators of compounds belonging to the
class of enamines.More particularly, the present invention relates
to the use as vulcanization accelerators of
compounds, derived from secondary amines, belonging to
the class of enamines.It is well known that the vulcanization of either
natural or synthetic rubbers takes place by cross-linking
between the polymeric chains, thanks to the
use of sulfur or peroxides.The vulcanization process in the presence of
sulfur was optimized by means of the use of
accelerators capable of reducing the vulcanization
times and of securing the reproducibility of the
results relating to the properties of the manufactured
articles.US- A- 4082706 discloses
enamines of the general formula (I), wherein R and
R1 are each primary or
secondary. saturated or unsaturated alkyl groups having from 1- 8 carbon atoms.
or together with the nitrogen atom form a cyclic ring structure having 4- 6 carbon
atoms in the ring; R7 and R3
are each hydrogen or alkyl groups having from 1 - 6 carbon atoms or can be joined
together to form a cyclic structure containing 5- 7 carbon atoms and are e.g.
methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl or phenyl; and R4
is hydrogen or a primary or secondary alkyl group having from 1 - 4
carbon atoms and is preferably hydrogen, methyl or ethyl. Suitable enamines are
e.g. 1-(2,6- dimethylmorpholino)- 2- ethyl hexene- 1 or N-cyclohex-1-enyl
dibutylamine.Said enamines are used as non- staining antiozonants in vulcanized products.
The enamines are added to the rubber mixture before vulcanization
and a white- wall tyre stock
is prepared thereof.The known products used as vulcanization
accelerators, as described, e.g., in Kirk-Othmer:
"Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology", Vol. 20, pages
337-364, are many. From these, we wish to remind here
aniline and its derivatives, mercaptobenzothiazole and
its sulfenamides, dithiocarbamates and thiuram
disulfides. In order to obtain good results, often
such products are not used as individual compounds,
but as combinations with each other.Among the vulcanization accelerators a class
exists of products which are defined as "secondary  
accelerators", useful as activators for thiazole-based
primary accelerators. Examples of such products are:
N,N'-diphenylguanidine (DPG), N,N'-di-orthotoluylguanidine
(DOTG), 2,4,6-tris-dimethylaminomethylphenol
and the condensation
products of aromatic amines with aliphatic aldehydes.The present Applicant has found now that
compounds, derived from secondary
