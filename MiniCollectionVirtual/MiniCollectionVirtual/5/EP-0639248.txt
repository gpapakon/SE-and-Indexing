<ABSTRACT>
The rope connector proposed is suitable for heavy-duty synthetic-fibre ropes (5). Cut in the envelope (2) of a rope-holding element (1) designed in the shape of a truncated cone is a spiral groove (3). In the first section (4) of the groove, the depth of the groove is the same as the diameter of the rope (5) but decreases towards the bottom, so that the rope (5), as it passes from top to bottom, progressively emerges from the groove (3). The angle of inclination of the groove (3) decreases from top to bottom, so that the rope (5) passes in through the entry aperture (6) straight and vertical, but terminates approximately horizontal at the lower end (7) of the rope-gripping element. The truncated-cone rope-holding element (1) is surrounded by a coaxially located conical cover (8) which has an opening at the upper end for the rope to pass in and which goes over to a cylindrical sleeve (9) at the lower end said sleeve being provided with a hole (10) for fixing a load. When the rope in under tension, the cover (8) rests against the holding element (1) and presses the rope (5) into the groove with a force which depends on the depth of the groove (3).

Cable end connection for a synthetic material cable (5) and 
consisting of an equipment (10) for the fastening of a cage or a 

counterweight of a lift plant and an equipment for the retention of the 
synthetic material cable, which equipment next to the entry of the 

cable (5) comprises a first sleeve-shaped portion (4), the internal 
cross-section of which is at least as wide as the cross-section of the 

entering cable and the inlet (6) of which is oriented in the direction 
of the tensioned cable, and which equipment comprises a second portion 

(14), which is arranged behind the first portion and in which the cable 
(5) is retained preferably by lateral pressure which increases with 

increasing tension force of the cable (5), wherein the first sleeve-shaped 
portion (4) of the equipment for the retention of the cable (5) 

displays a curved groove (3), which extends around an axis (11) lying 
in the direction of the tensioned cable (5) and in which the incoming 

cable (5) in the case of tension stress stands in connection with the 
groove walls (3, 21) merely under friction so that the tension force is 

successively taken up by the groove (3, 21). 
Cable end connection according to claim 1, characterised thereby, 
that the curvature of the groove (3, 21) increases becoming gradually 

ever greater from the initially rectilinear inlet (6). 
Cable end connection according to claim 2, characterised thereby, 
that the radius of curvature of the groove (3, 21) after the more 

weakly curved portion amounts to about 1 to 6 times the cable diameter. 
Cable end connection according to one of the claims 1 to 3, 
characterised thereby, that the equipment for the retention of the 

cable (5) comprises a retaining body (1), at the frusto-conical 
envelope surface (2) of which the groove (3) is incised spirally.  

 
Cable end connection according to claim 4, characterised thereby, 
that the groove depth in the first portion (4) corresponds with the 

cable diameter of the synthetic material cable (5) and reduces in the 
further course so that the cable (5) as seen from the inlet (6) 

protrudes increasingly from the groove (3) and that the second portion 
comprises a hollow conical bell (8), which is co-axial with the 

retaining body (1) of frusto-conical outline and surrounds the 
retaining body (1) and which comprises an opening for the cable entry 

at the upper end and the equipment (10) for the fastening of a load at 
the lower end. 
Cable end connection according to claim 4 or 5, characterised 
thereby, that the pitch of the spiral groove (3) as seen from the inlet 

(6) reduces and ends in a helical line at the body end (7) at the end 
of the cable. 
Cable end connection according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised thereby, that the retaining body (1) at the body end (7) 

arranged therebehind comprises a cylindrical body part (15), wherein 
the groove (3), which has been cut in spiral shape into the retaining 

body (1), continues in helical shape at the cylindrical body part (15) 
and is encompassed by a cylindrical sleeve part (9) of the bell (8). 
Cable end connection according to one of the claims 5 to 7, 
characterised thereby, that the bell wall of the bell (8) displays a 

smaller slope than the envelope surface (2) of the frusto-conical 
retaining body (1). 
Cable end connection according to one of the claims 1 to 3, 
characterised thereby, that the equipment for the retention of the 

cable (5) comprises a first retaining plate (17) with a first meander-shaped 
half groove (19) and a second retaining plate (18) with a 

corresponding second meander-shaped half groove (20), which retaining 
plates (17, 18) in the state, in which they lie each gaplessly against 

the other, display one groove (21), which is formed of the two half 
grooves (19, 20) and receives the synthetic material cable (5) 

completely.  
 
Cable end connection according to claim 9, characterised by a 
pressing device at the cable end and consisting of a conical sleeve 

(22), into which the cable end fanned out into a moulded cone (23) is 
laid.
