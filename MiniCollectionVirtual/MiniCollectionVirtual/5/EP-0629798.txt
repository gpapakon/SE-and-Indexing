<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a
compliant seal device for sealing a high pressure area from a low
pressure area, as defined in the preamble of claim 1. A compliant seal
of this type is known from DE-A1-1 475 588. Another compliant seal is
known from EP-A2-0 473 018.Many classes of machinery use clearance seals to contain a
gas under pressure. Often these seals are simple labyrinth seals
which break down pressure by using a series of teeth or blades in
close proximity to a rotating shaft. Such devices are well known
and reliable, but allow high rates of gas leakage. Typically,
clearances between the blade tips of a labyrinth seal and the
shaft are as high as 0,001 - 0,002 mm per mm (inches per inch) of shaft
diameter.Much work has been done to reduce the leakage of labyrinth
seals. Typically, the approach of past efforts has been directed
toward improved blade geometry (e.g., backward angled blade
designs), step seals, or interlocking blade designs to reduce
losses. Abradable labyrinth seal designs have also been developed
and are employed, particularly, on jet engines. The blades of
such abradable seals are initially installed with a line-to-line
clearance, and then wear in to their own clearance as the machine
rotates. However, after the rotor has gone through an operating
history of radial vibration combined with axial excursions, a
crescent-shaped clearance is often cut into the abradable seal,
and leakage can increase dramatically. In spite of many improved 
designs, therefore, leakage losses for labyrinth seals continue to
represent a considerable energy loss in rotating machinery.Another significant problem with high pressure labyrinth
seals is the occurrence of rotordynamic effects. Since high
pressure gas is quite dense, a labyrinth seal begins to act as a
bearing with high gas pressures, but tends to destabilize the
rotor due to a lack of concentricity with the actual machine
bearings. Significant effort has been made recently to decrease
rotordynamic excitation effects. The product of these efforts
includes swirl breaks in front of a labyrinth, reverse swirl
inducers, and injecting tangentially non-moving gas into the first
stagnant region of the labyrinth. Other work has been
concentrated on optimized geometry and creating a rough surface
within the labyrinth seal to retard circumferential gas velocity
buildup. Also, honeycomb design labyrinth seals have been
developed to reduce rotordynamic excitation effects. However,
further reduction of rotordynamic effects is needed.As an alternative
