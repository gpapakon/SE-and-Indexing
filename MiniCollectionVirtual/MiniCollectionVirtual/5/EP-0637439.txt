<ABSTRACT>
A spinal implant (10) comprising an integral 
member formed by upper and lower walls (12,14) a front 

wall (22), a rear wall (38) and side walls (16,18), said 
member defining an enclosed interior chamber accessible 

through an opening (33) in a wall (12) of said member, 
said opening (33) permitting insertion of cancellous 

bone material into said interior chamber, and further 
comprising a removable cap (32) for covering said access 

opening (33) to said interior chamber, and a plurality 
of openings (20,36) defined through said implant (10) 

capable of receiving bone ingrowth material 
therethrough.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an artificial 
fusion implant to be placed into the intervertebral space 
left after the removal of a damaged spinal disc. The purpose of the present invention is to 
provide an implant to be placed within the intervertebral 
disc space and provide for the permanent elimination of all 
motion at that location. To do so, the device is space 
occupying within the disc space, rigid, self-stabilizing to 
resist dislodgement, stabilizing to the adjacent spinal 
vertebrae to eliminate local motion, and able to 
intrinsically participate in a vertebra to vertebra bony 
fusion so as to assure the permanency of the result. At present, following the removal of a damaged 
disc, either bone or nothing is placed into the spacea 
left. If nothing is placed in the space the space may 
collapse which may result in damage to the nerves; or the 
space may fill with scar tissue and eventually lead to a 
reherniation. The use of bone is less than optimal in that 
the bone obtained from the patient requires additional 
surgery and is of limited availability in its most useful 
form, and if obtained elsewhere, lacks living bone cells, 
carries a significant risk of infection, and is also 
limited in supply as it is usually obtained elsewhere, 
lacks living bone cells, carries a significant risk of 
infection, and is also limited in supply as it is usually 
obtained from young accident victims. Furthermore, 
regardless of the source of the bone, it is only marginal 
structurally and lacks a means to either stabilize itself, 
against dislodgement, or to stabilize the adjacent 
vertebrae. A review of all possibly related prior art will 
demonstrate the novelty of the present invention. There have been an extensive number of attempts 
to develop an acceptable disc prothesis (an artificial  
 
disc). Such devices by design would be used to replace a 
damaged disc and seek to restore the height of the 
interspace and to restore the normal motion of that spinal 
joint. No such device has been found that is medically 
acceptable. This group of prosthetic or artificial disc 
replacements seeking to preserve spinal motion which are 
different from the present invention include:

flexible disc implant. Patent No. 4,349,921 KUNTZ - describing a 
flexible disc replacement with rope or file like surface 
projections to discourage device dislocation. Patent No. 4,309,777 PATIL - describing motion

A spinal implant (10) comprising an 
integral member formed by upper and lower walls (12,14) 

a front wall (22), a rear wall (38) and side walls 
(16,18), 

   characterized in that said member defines an 
enclosed interior chamber accessible through an opening 

(33) in a wall (12) of said member, said opening (33) 
permitting insertion of cancellous bone material into 

said interior chamber, and in further comprising 
   a removable cap (32) for covering said 

access opening (33) to said interior chamber, and 
   a plurality of openings (20,36) defined 

through said implant (10) capable of receiving bone 
ingrowth material therethrough. 
The spinal implant of claim 1, 
characterized in that said implant (10) has the 

plurality of openings (20,36) through the walls 
(12,14,22,38) of said implant (10) 
The spinal implant of claim 1, 
characterized in that said implant (10) is substantially 

the same shape and dimensions as a disc. 
The spinal implant of claim 1, 
characterized in that said implant comprises a front 

wall (24) having an threaded opening (26) therein for 
engagement with a threaded driving member (30). 
The spinal implant of claim 4, 
characterized in that said front wall (32) has a driver 

engaging portion (24). 
The spinal implant of claim 5, 
characterized in that said engaging means comprises a 

depression (24) on the front wall (32). 
The spinal implant of claim 1, 
characterized in that said removable cap (32) includes 

threads for attachment to said implant (10). 
The spinal implant of claim 1, 
characterized in that said plurality of openings (20) 

are defined in said upper and lower walls (12,14). 
The spinal implant of claim 1, 
characterized in that said cap (32) defines a plurality 

of openings therethrough for receiving bone ingrowth 
material. 
The spinal implant of claim 1, 
characterized in that said opening (33) to said interior 

chamber is defined in said upper wall (12) of said 
implant (10). 
The spinal implant of claim 10, 
characterized in that said opening (33) is sized so that 

the area of the opening (33) constitutes a substantial 
portion of the area of said upper wall (12). 
The combination of the spinal implant 
(10) of claim 1 with a driving member (30) for driving 

the spinal implant (10), characterized in that said 
driving member (30) comprises a first hollow tubular 

member (40), said hollow member (40) having an irregular 
end for conforming to the external shape of the front 

wall (22) of the spinal implant (10) and a second rod 
member (42) fitted within said hollow tubular member 

(40), said rod member (42) having a threaded portion 
(46) at one end (28) and an enlarged knob portion (44) 

at the other end. 
The combination of claim 12, 
characterized in that said irregular end (28) comprises 

an extended portion (48) for fitting within a depressed 
portion (24) of the spinal implant (10).
