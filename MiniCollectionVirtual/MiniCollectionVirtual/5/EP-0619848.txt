<ABSTRACT>
A product containing silicon dioxide contains silicon dioxide in the form of polysilicic acid in a supporting structure of cellulose. The polysilicic acid contains aluminium silicate sites. In the preparation of the product the cellulose and the silicon dioxide in the form of polysilicic acid are blended to obtain the blended product in a solid form. The blended product obtained is modified with a compound containing aluminium, such as a solution of sodium aluminate, which causes the formation of aluminium silicate sites on the polysilicic acid. The cellulose used is viscose cellulose.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a product containing silicon
dioxide according to the preamble of the claim 1 attached
and a method for its preparation according to the
claim 4 attached.Considerable demand has grown on markets in recent years
for fibres which are either incombustible or resistant
to combustion. Consequently a number of fibres have
appeared on the market which are suitable for textiles
inhibiting fire. Fibres containing silicon dioxide are
outstanding in their fire-resistance, and they are
manufactured by various methods including the Enka
method in which regenerated silicon dioxide fibres are
spun by the dry method from a waterglass solution from
which the excess water has been removed prior to regeneration;
this method is described in the patent
literature in publications DE-2900990, US-4332601 and
EP-160232. In other methods silicon dioxide or silicate
glass are used as the raw material, but products made by
the former method are expensive while those made by the
latter method are too fragile.GB patent 1064271 presents a relatively inexpensive
method for the manufacture of a product containing
silicon dioxide. In this case the viscose containing an
evenly distributed quantity of sodium silicate is spun
in an acid spinbath, where the viscose is regenerated
into cellulose and the sodium silicate contained in it
is precipitated as polysilicic acid, which is a water-containing
form of silicon dioxide evenly distributed
throughout the cellulose.The products manufactured by the above method, for
example in the form of fibres, have proved to be extremely
usable and inexpensive by virtue of the production 
method, and because of the water bound in them fire
resistant in specific conditions. The fibres have been
used in a number of applications including particularly
nonwovens and upholstery textiles. During applications
development a number of shortcomings have been revealed
owing to which the fibres are not very suitable for
clothing textiles or textiles where a very high level of
fire resistance is required. In order to obtain a
sufficiently high level of fire resistance the proportion
of polysilicic acid should be as high as possible,
but for technical reasons it cannot be raised much above
40 percent. One severe disadvantage in textiles which
are likely to be washed frequently is that polysilicic
acid has a low tolerance of alkaline conditions. It has
been observed that using ordinary washing agents the
content of polysilicic acid falls to about half the
original after only 20 washing cycles. Even

<CLAIMS>
A product containing silicon dioxide in the form of polysilicic acid
in a cellulosic supporting structure, 
characterised
 in that the
polysilicic acid contains aluminium silicate sites.
A product according to claim 1, 
characterised
 in that the weight

characterised
 in that the
cellulose is regenerated viscose cellulose in which the cellulose and

the polysilicic acid are homogenously distributed in the same phase.
A method for the preparation of a product containing silicon
dioxide in a cellulosic supporting structure in which method the

silicon dioxide in the form of polysilicic acid is caused to become
distributed throughout the cellulosic supporting structure to obtain a

solid composite product, 
characterised
 in that the composite
