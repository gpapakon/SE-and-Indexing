<ABSTRACT>
Method for evaluating the damage to the structure of a rock (114) surrounding a well (110), comprising the following steps:   - injecting into the rock (114), already saturated with a first fluid of a first viscosity, an oil of viscosity greater than the first viscosity, - recording the pressure of the injected oil as a function of time;   - analysis of the change in the pressure of the injected oil in order to deduce the zones of different permeability present in the rock (114).

Method for evaluating damage to the structure of rock 
surrounding a well, comprising the following steps: 


from a chamber set in the well, injecting the 
rock, which is already saturated with a first fluid 

having a first viscosity, with an oil and recording 
the pressure of the injected oil as a function of 

time, 
analysing the development of the pressure of the 
injected oil in order to deduce the areas of 

different permeability present in the rock, 
characterised in that an oil having a viscosity 

between 10 and 100 times that of the first fluid is 
used, that the development of the pressure of the 

injected oil is analysed from the chamber, and that 
the analysis of the development of the permeability 

as a function of the distance from the well is 
performed using the derivative with respect to time 

of the oil pressure development curve as a function 
of time. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the saturation of the rock with the first fluid is 

due to a fluid already present in the drilled well. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the saturation of the rock with the first fluid is 

done from the surface. 
Method accoding to claim 3, characterised by the use 
of an oil as the first fluid. 
Method according to any of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised by the use of an oil having a viscosity 

30 times greater than that of the first fluid.
