<ABSTRACT>
A hinge that provides equilibration and variable friction for a display screen or a laptop lid (7). In the preferred embodiment, a torsion rod (25) provides a restoring force which increases as the lid is moved either direction from its vertical position. A friction hinge, of well know design, uses a spring band (23) about a shaft (21). One end of the torsion rod is coupled to the end of the band of the friction hinge, so that the moment in the torsion rod increases or decreases the moment in the spring band of the hinge, modifying the frictional torque accordingly. This allows the frictional torque to be low as the lid is first opened, and larger as the display reaches the useful range of its motion.

<DESCRIPTION>
 EQUILIBRATED HINGE WITH VARIABLE FRICTIONAL TORQUEThis invention relates to friction hinges for such devices as electronic displays and other objects requiring accurate, but adjustable angular positioning.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONFriction hinges are used to mount displays to the bases of laptops. The frictional torque they provide holds the displays in position during use. This frictional torque must be sufficient to keep the display from falling, even when the laptop is lightly bumped or bounced. Most prior art hinges in use today provide torque which remains essentially constant over their angular range of motion. This results in the need, by the user, to overcome this torque when opening the laptop. Laptop computers have become progressively lighter, but their displays have not kept pace in so far as weight reduction is concerned. Modern color displays now constitute a larger fraction of the total weight of laptops than did those of a few years ago. If sufficient frictional torque is provided to hold the lid satisfactorily in position during use then, using the hinges of the prior art which provide constant torque, the base of the laptop may lift as the user attempts to open the lid, requiring the user to hold the base down with one hand while the other hand raises the lid. This is regarded by users as a deficiency, and laptop manufacturers are eager for a solution to this problem. Torsion rods have been used to alleviate this problem by affixing one end of the rod to the lid and the other to the base. The torsion rod is in its relaxed position when the lid is open or partially open. As the lid is closed, the torsion rod is wound. Some of the 

force required to wind the torsion rod comes from the weight of the lid; the remainder is provided by the user. When closed, a latch or a detent keeps the lid closed. When the lid is opened, torque from the torsion rod holds down the base and assists in opening the lid. Touchscreen applications required additional torque to resist the pressure exerted on the screen during operation, and the increase in torque for the open positions is of great advantage in those cases.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONIn the present invention, a torsion rod is used as described above except that one end of the torsion rod is attached to an element of the friction hinge to control the torque so that the friction is low as the lid is first opened, and progressively enhanced as the display reaches the useful range of its motion. U.S. Patent number 5,231,734 discloses a hinge whose
