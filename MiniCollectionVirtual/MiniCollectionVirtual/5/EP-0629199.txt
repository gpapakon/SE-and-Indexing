These compounds are useful psychotherapeutics and are potent serotonin (5-HT1) agonists and may be used in the treatment of depression, anxiety, eating disorders, obesity, drug abuse, cluster headache, migraine, pain and chronic paroxysmal hemicrania and headache associated with vascular disorders, and other disorders arising from deficient serotonergic neurotransmission. The compounds can also be used as centrally acting antihypertensives and vasodilators.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to indole derivatives, to processes and
intermediates for their preparation, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them and
to their medicinal use. The active compounds of the present invention are useful in
treating migraine and other disorders.United States Patents 4,839,377 and 4,855,314 and European Patent Application
Publication Number 313397 refer to 5-substituted 3-aminoalkyl indoles. The
compounds are said to be useful for the treatment of migraine.British Patent Application 040279 refers to 3-aminoalkyl-1H-indole-5-thioamides
and carboxamides. The compounds are said to be useful in treating hypertension,
Raymond's disease and migraine.European Patent Application Publication Number 303506 refers to 3-poly:hydropyridyl-5-substituted-1H-indoles.
The compounds are said to have 5-HT1 receptor
agonist and vasoconstrictor activity and to be useful in treating migraine.European Patent Application Publication Number 35477 refers to N-piperidinyl:indolyl:ethyl-alkane
sulfonamide derivatives. The compounds are said to
have 5-HT1 receptor agonist and vasoconstrictor activity and to be useful in treating
cephalic pain.International patent application No. WO91/18897 discloses indole-substituted
six-membered heterocyclic compounds which are said to have
exceptional "5-HT1 -like" receptor agonism and excellent absorption following
oral administration. This makes the compounds particularly well suited for the
prophylaxis and treatment of migraine and related headache disorders. European Patent Application Publication Numbers 438230, 494774, and 497512
refer to indole-substituted five-membered heteroaromatic compounds. The compounds
are said to have 5-HT1-like receptor agonist activity and to be useful in the treatment
of migraine and other disorders for which a selective agonist of these receptors is
indicated.The present invention relates to compounds of the formula
 
where A represents a direct bond, C1-C4 alkyl, or C1-C4 alkenyl; n is 0, 1, or 2; R1 is
hydrogen, C1-C6 alkyl, aryl, C1-C3 alkylaryl, C1-C3 alkylheteroaryl, or -(CH2)mR6; W, X,
Y, and Z are each independently oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen or carbon, provided that at
least one of W, X, Y, or Z is nitrogen and, in the cases where W, X, Y, or Z are
independently nitrogen or carbon, R2, R3, R4 and R5 are each independently
