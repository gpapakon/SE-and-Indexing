<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the use of sodium cromoglycate in the therapeutic treatment 
of upper respiratory tract infections. The term "upper respiratory tract infections" (URTIs) is used by those skilled in the 
art to describe those acute respiratory illnesses, including the common cold and 
influenza, which are caused by a variety of different viruses. Such illnesses are characterised by their sudden onset, and highly infectious and self-limiting 
nature, with symptoms varying in severity depending upon the virus which is 
responsible. Symptoms of the common cold typically start with a mild malaise, fatigue, a dry or 
sore throat and nasal discomfort, usually reaching maximum severity on the second 
or third day. At this stage additional, more incapacitating symptoms such as nasal 
discharge and congestion, sneezing, hoarseness and a cough are observed. In more 
severe cases patients experience fever with associated headache and muscle pain, 
vocal impairment and loss of the senses of smell and taste. Symptoms of influenza are usually more intense and include fever, which may be 
severe and persist for several days, general fatigue and weakness, and severe 
discomfort due to intense muscular aching and headache. Although the symptoms of URTIs are typically not regarded as serious, they often 
result in lost time at work or school and in this respect impose a substantial cost on 
society. In addition, even mild URTIs have been known to lead to more serious 
conditions such as bronchitis; influenza is known to be fatal when acquired by 
vulnerable individuals. Existing treatments which find utility in the symptomatic treatment of URTIs 
comprise active ingredients which target individual or closely related symptoms.  Treatments indicated for overall relief of the symptoms of URTI are thus merely 
combinations of these active ingredients. Thus a treatment indicated for relief of all the symptoms of an URTI would typically 
comprise an analgesic (eg aspirin or paracetamol) to combat fever and relieve pain; 
a decongestant (eg ephedrine or pseudoephedrine) to reduce nasal congestion; an 
antitussive (eg codeine) or expectorant (eg ammonium chloride) to alleviate cough; 
and an antihistamine (eg diphenhydramine or triprolidine) for use as a sedative. Treatments indicated for sore throats are usually administered separately and may 
comprise an anaesthetic agent (eg benzocaine) to relieve pain. There is thus no treatment presently available, comprising a single active ingredient, 
which is effective against
