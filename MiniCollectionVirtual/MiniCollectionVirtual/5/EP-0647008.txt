<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a method for winding commutator armatures for electric motors, two coils of the same armature are in each case wound at the same time. In this case, the processed length of the wound-on wire of each coil is measured continuously and the difference between the processed wire lengths is detected as a signal. Using the method, it is possible via the difference in the wire lengths, to identify immediately differences in the wire diameter and the wire quality as well as forming errors of the winding tools, and to correct these differences in an appropriate manner, so that winding asymmetries which lead to the armature being unbalanced can be avoided. In the case of a winding machine which is suitable for carrying out the method and has two wire feed devices for simultaneous winding of in each case two coils on the same armature, each of the wire feed devices (10) has a device (28, 30) for measuring the length of the wound-on wire (11), as well as a control unit (32) for providing an electrical signal if a predetermined wire length difference is exceeded.

Process for winding commutator rotors for electric 
motors in which two coils of the same rotor are wound 

simultaneously, characterized in that the processed 
length of the wound wire of each coil is measured 

continuously and the difference between the processed 
wire lengths detected as a signal.
