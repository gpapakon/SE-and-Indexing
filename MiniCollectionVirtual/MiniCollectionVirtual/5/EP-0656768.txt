<ABSTRACT>
A penile prosthesis (12) or implant utilizes expandable cylinders or bladders (14) implanted in the penis along with a fluid transfer system including a pump (18), hydraulic reservoir (24), and interconnecting fuid lines, connectors, etc. The prosthesis includes a biocompatible triglyceride with radiopaque dye as the hydraulic fluid (20) utilizes radiolucent materials to form the bladder (14) to enhance leak detection, and textures the exterior surface of the reservoir and bladders in order to decrease the likelihood of failure through fold flaw or capsular contracture.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PENILE IMPLANT WITH TRIGLYCERIDE FILL Cross-Reference to Related ApplicationsThis application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Application Serial No. 07/932,603 filed August 20, 1992; and is related to U.S. Application Serial No. 07/952,687 filed September 29, 1992Background and Summary of the InventionImplantable penile prostheses are well known in the art and generally include a pair of bladder-like penile implants for implantation into the two corpora cavernosa, a fluid transfer system including a reservoir for containing 50 c.c. of a hydraulic liquid fill, and a pump with a set of valves in fluid lines interconnecting the implants with the reservoir. The fluid transfer system is generally constructed of elastomeric compo- nents, including tubing and connectors, and silicone is a typical material used for their construction. Because of its size, the reservoir is generally implanted in the abdomen while the pump is generally bulb-shaped and is typically implanted within the male scrotum. Erection is typically achieved by pumping the bulb-like pump to 

transfer fluid from the reservoir into the bladder-like penile implants. Examples of these devices are shown in the following U.S. Patents: Patent No. 3,954,102; Patent No. 4,360,010; Patent No. 4,424,807; Patent No. 4,558,693; Patent No. 4,881,530; and Patent No. 5,101,813.The hydraulic fluid generally used in the prior art includes silicone oil, saline, water, and other kinds of non-specific "biocompatible filler". These materials are generally chosen because of their presumed biocompat- ability and/or lubricity. In U.S. Patent No. 3,954,102, a biocompatible fill is suggested which may be doctored with a biocompatible radiopaque dye in order to facili¬ tate the tracing of any leaks from the system to thereby localize and minimize the required surgical intrusion to correct the leak. The tracing of leaks is an important consideration for prior art penile implants because of their regular use and resulting significant incidence of failure. In performance of the intended use of penile implants, there is a regular cycling of the hydraulic fill from the reservoir to the bladders and then back again. Because of this cycling of fluid, there is a focus on the abrasive effect that the fluid has on the bladders, as well as the pump and its valves, and the tubes and connectors, over time. This is because of the risk of deterioration, leakage, and even rupture of one or more of the system components. With the fill material suggested and used in the prior art,
