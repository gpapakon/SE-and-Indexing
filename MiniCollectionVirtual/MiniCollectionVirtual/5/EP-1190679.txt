<ABSTRACT>
The location and position of a position-detector (5) in the form of an arm can be altered in relation to a functional unit (1) in the form of an operation microscope. The position-locator-arm has a cantilevered element (14) joined to the functional unit by means of a ball and socket joint (10). The arm has a position-detector part (16) connected to the cantilevered element by a ball and socket joint (12) and spaced apart from the functional unit. The position-detector arm has a transmitter with at least three transmitter elements (19,21,23,25,27,29).

Medical therapy and/or diagnosis operation

- having a functional unit (1) and
- having a position detection device which is intended to cooperate with a further detection device (7) to be arranged fixed in orientation and position and separated from the position detection device (5) by a signal path, in order to detect the position of the medical therapy and/or diagnosis apparatus upon activation,
characterized in that
- means are provided for detecting the respective orientation of the position detection device (5) relative to the functional unit (1) of the medical therapy and/or diagnosis apparatus, so that the activated position detection device (5) can have its position and orientation changed relative to the functional unit (1) in the course of operation.
Therapy and/or diagnosis device according to Claim 1, wherein the functional unit (1) is an operation microscope.
Therapy and/or diagnosis device according to Claim 1 or 2, wherein the position detection device is designed as a position detection arm (5) extending away from the functional unit (1).
Therapy and/or diagnosis device according to Claim 3, wherein the position detection arm (5) has a boom element (14) connected to the functional unit (1) via a ball joint (10).
Therapy and/or diagnosis device according to Claim 3, wherein the position detection arm (5) has a position detection part (16) which is connected to the boom element (14) via a ball joint (10) and is arranged at a distance from the functional unit (1).
Therapy and/or diagnosis device according to one of Claims 1 to 5, wherein the functional unit (1) has sensing points (35, 37, 39).
Therapy and/or diagnosis device according to one of Claims 2 to 6, wherein the position detection arm (5) comprises a transmitter device having at least three transmitter elements (19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29) arranged spatially distributed.
