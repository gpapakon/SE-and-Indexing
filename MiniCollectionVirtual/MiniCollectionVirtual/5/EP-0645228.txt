<ABSTRACT>
A mold clamping apparatus used for an electric injection molding machine, designed so as to improve the 
durability of a toggle mechanism and increase the clamping force. A motor support (33) is supported resiliently on a 

rear platen (31), and a motor (35) is fixed to the motor support (33). A toggle mechanism is provided between the 
motor support (33) and a movable platen (2), and this platen (2) can be moved by rotating the motor (35). A rod 

(45) is also provided, one end portion of which extends so that it can engage the rear platen freely, and the other end 
portion of which supports the toggle mechanism. A reaction force of the clamping force is transmitted directly to the 

rear platen (31).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a clamping device for an 
electric-powered injection molding machine. In a conventional injection molding machine designed so that 
a resin heated and fluidized in a heating cylinder is injected and 
poured into a cavity in a mold under a high pressure, cooled, 
solidified and cured in the cavity, and then, the mold is opened 
to remove a molded product, a clamping device is provided to 
prevent the resin poured into the cavity from being leaked 
therefrom through matched surfaces of dies. In an electric-powered 
injection molding machine using a motor as a drive source, the 
opening and closing of the mold are carried out by a crank 
mechanism or a ball screw feed mechanism, and the die-clamping is 
carried out by a clamping cylinder. In this case, when the die-clamping has been completed, an 
oil within the clamping cylinder is drained, and the opening of 
the mold is carried out by the crank mechanism or the ball screw 
feed mechanism (see Japanese Patent Application Laid-open 
No.39223/91). Fig. 1 is a schematic view of a clamping device for the prior  
 
art electric-powered injection molding machine. Referring to Fig. 1, the injection molding machine includes a 
stationary platen 1 and a movable platen 2 which are mounted to 
dies 3a and 3b of a mold, respectively, and a toggle support 4 
movable on a base 5. The movable platen 2 is moved by a single-toggle 
mechanism 6 disposed between the toggle support 4 and the 
movable platen 2, thereby performing the opening and closing of 
the mold. Four parallel tie bars 7 are disposed at four corners of the 
toggle support and each slidably passed through holes 1a and 2a 
defined in the stationary and movable platens 1 and 2. Each of the 
tie bars 7 is fixed at one end thereof to the toggle support 4 
and at the other end to a piston 9 in a clamping cylinder 8 
mounted to the stationary platen 1. An oil chamber adjacent a rod 
of the clamping cylinder 8, i.e., adjacent the tie bar 7 is in 
communication with a small-sized hydraulic pressure generating 
unit 11. The single-toggle mechanism 6 includes a bracket 12 fixed to 
the toggle support 4, a first link 13 pivotally supported on the 
bracket 12, a second link 14 pivotally mounted to the first link 
13 through a link pin 18, and a bracket 15 rotatably supporting 
the second link 14 and fixed to the movable platen 2. The first 
link 13 has a shaft 16 connected to a drive shaft of a motor with 
a reducing device (e.g., a servo motor having a planetary gear 
reducing device
