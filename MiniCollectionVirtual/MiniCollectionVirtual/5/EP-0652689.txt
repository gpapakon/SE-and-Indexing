<ABSTRACT>
A modular lamp power supply is adapted to provide lamp 
power supply signals to a plurality of different lamps, each lamp 

having different power requirements. The power supply can be 
reconfigured to supply power to a new group of lamps simply by 

replacing the power circuit modules within the supply chassis.

<DESCRIPTION>
When lighting a stage or other performance area, it
is the usual practice to hang lighting instruments or
luminaires from pipes or trusses about the area and
locate the luminaires' lamp power supplies, or
intensity "dimmers", on the floor adjacent to the area,
closer to a source of electric energy. Dimmers can be
heavy and, where there is no special need for them to
be hung with the luminaires, it is usually simplest and
most practical to put the dimmers in one place, such as
in a rack upon the floor, close to the power source,
where they are accessible for maintenance.When it is desired to power incandescent lamps,
power cables are run from a dimmer rack up into the
lighting rig to carry controlled voltage AC electrical
energy to the lamps in the luminaires. To minimise the
number of separate cables which must be run up into the
lighting rig, as many as six separate power circuits,
each consisting of two power conductors and a safety
ground conductor, can be combined into one multiple-conductor
cable. Once in the rig, the cables are
connected to a "break-out box" which provides six
separate output connections for individual luminaires.This is sufficient cabling for conventional, fixed-focus
luminaires having no motorised sub-systems. For
automated luminaires, however, which have motorised
mechanisms for adjusting multiple parameters such as the
color, focus, pan tilt, etc., of the beam, a separate
constant-voltage power circuit must be provided to 
supply the motors and control electronics, and control
signal wiring must also be provided to connect the
control electronics to some kind of manual or automated
control facility. Systems of this kind are described
in US Patents No. 4 392 187 and 4 980 806. Luminaires
used in these systems usually contain a lamp power
supply housed within a chassis along with the control
electronics and DC power supplies used for the lamp's
motors and electronic circuits. The power input cable
provides a single AC power circuit for the luminaire
and also provides one or two data transmission circuits
for control signals and, in some cases, status
reporting signals.The means for varying the intensity of a luminaire
depends upon the type of luminaire. For instance,
incandescent luminaires require a dimmable power supply
(often housed within the luminaire itself), while arc-lamp
luminaires must be dimmed by means of a mechanical
dimmer, because arc lamps require constant power.Recently, a new configuration of automated
luminaire has appeared, characterised by features that
