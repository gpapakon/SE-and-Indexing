<ABSTRACT>
A process for production of a steel component having a hard, 
rich carbon soluted surface and a tough, low carbon soluted 

core, incorporating the following steps: 

using an alloyed steel with a carbon content of 0.3-1.2 % C 
and with an alloy element acting as a strong carbide former, 

and 
subjecting a component formed from this material to induction 
heating, whereby the core is heated to a level in the lower 

region df the austenite area, thereby creating a certain 
soluted low carbon level in the component core, and rapidly 

heating the surface region to a higher region within the 
austenite area, thereby creating a high soluted carbon 

content in the surface region of the component.

<DESCRIPTION>
For producing components which are subjected to fatigue
stresses case-hardening (carburization) is often used. This
carburization gives the component a hard, carbon-rich surface
at the same time as a tough, low-carbon core is obtained
after hardening and annealing. Such a component has a very
good resistance to wear and fatigue. The profile of hardness/residual
stress obtained is schematically illustrated
in the accompanying Fig. 1, and the surface residual stresses
obtained are very favourable from fatigue life point of view.However the case-carburizing procedure is a rather expensive
and slow process and therefore many attempts have been made
to use surface hardening with induction heating. Thereby is
normally used a low-alloyed steel having a higher content of
carbon, e.g. 0.5-0.6% and the surface zone of the component
is heated rapidly, whereupon the component is subjected to
quenching. The profile of hardness/residual stress then
obtained is illustrated schematically in the accompanying
Fig. 2. For instance, FR-A-1 441 317 discloses a process of
induction hardening in which only the surface is fully austenitized.This profile of hardness/residual stress obtained from a
surface induction hardened component in combination with the
low alloy steels used is sufficient in several situations,
but often gives a limited contact fatigue strength and it
also gives raise to problems under other fatigue conditions.
One factor contributing to the often inferior properties is
the reduction of hardness which is experienced at a distance
below the surface of the material, and also the fact that
most of the positive residual stresses are concentrated to
the same depth. This occurs especially when using a medium
hard core.The martensite formed at the conventional induction heating
using a low-alloyed steel will almost immediately reach the
full carbon content, i.e. 0.5 - 0.6 %. The purpose of the
present invention now therefore is to propose a process using
induction hardening, thereby giving a more in-expensive and 
more rapid result than case-carburization but which eliminates
the drawbacks earlier experienced with induction hardening,
and this has been obtained with a process as defined in
the accompanying claim 1.For obtaining such a result it now is proposed a process
adapted to give a result resembling to that obtained with
case-carburizing, i.e. with a core having a solid soluted
carbon content of 0.1 - 0.5 % and a surface layer having a
carbon content of 0.5 - 1.2 %, and for this purpose is used
an alloyed

<CLAIMS>
A process for production of a steel component having a hard, rich carbon soluted
surface and a tough, low carbon soluted core,

using an alloyed steel with a carbon content of 0.3 - 1.2% C and with an alloy element
acting as a strong carbide former, and subjecting a component formed from this material

to induction heating, whereby the core area is heated to a level in the lower region of the
austenite area, at a temperature between 800 and 1000°C, thereby creating a

certain soluted carbon level in the component core of 0.1 - 0.5 % C, and heating the
surface region to a higher region within the austenite area, at a temperature of about 900

- 1200°C, thereby creating a certain soluted carbon level in the surface region of the
component of 0.5 - 1.2 % C.
A process as claimed in claim 1, in which
the strong carbide-forming alloy element chromium is used in an amount of 1 - 25 %.
