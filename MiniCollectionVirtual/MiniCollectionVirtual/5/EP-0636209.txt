<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a solenoid actuated valve
assembly and, more particularly, to means for controlling the bounce of an
armature of a solenoid valve.Typically, a solenoid valve comprises an armature movable
between a first and second position. The extremes of these first and
second positions are often defined by mechanical stops. Armatures can
be moved in one direction by an electro-magnetic force generated by a
coil of wire and moved in the opposite direction by a return spring. When
the armature impacts a stop, it bounces.In high speed fluid metering solenoids, armature bounce is a
problem because each bounce of the armature, or valving element,
meters a small uncontrolled amount of fuel into the engine, to the
detriment of emissions. As can be appreciated, the leakage of fuel into
the engine will result in very unfavorable fuel economy. At either end of its
motion, the armature has kinetic energy as a result of its mass and
velocity. With no means for dissipating that energy, it is returned to the
armature by the elastic collision with the stop. Eventually, the energy is
dissipated after a series of collisions and bounces. The bounce of the
armature affects the operation of a fuel injector by prolonging or
shortening the duration of injection, causing excessive wear in the valve
seat area.It is seen then that there exists a need for a means for damping the
motion of an armature to diminish bounce, thereby diminishing the amount
of fuel into the engine and the wear in the valve seat area.From JP 59-5872A it is known to provide a spring disk washer
to hold parts of an eddy current chamber in the outlet of a fuel injector
nozzle. The spring disk washer has no interaction with the valve seat.From US 4 915 354A it is known to provide a spring disk washer
as a valve seat member at the valve's outlet end. From US 4 971 254 A, which represents the closest state of the art, it is known to provide an electrically
operated valve assembly comprising: a housing having an outlet end at
which is disposed a valve seat member which comprises a seat surface; a
needle valve; actuating means comprising an electric actuator, for moving
the needle valve in a first direction and a second direction to cause the
needle valve to contact and separate from the seat surface and thereby
control flow from the outlet end; and a guide for guiding the motion of the
needle valve.From this prior art it is not known to arrange a damping means
such that the damping means biases the valve seat against the needle
valve and

<CLAIMS>
A solenoid actuated valve assembly (10) comprising:

a valve housing (12) comprising an outlet end (24) at which is
disposed a valve seat member (30) which comprises a seat surface;
a needle valve (44);
an armature (14), a coil (36) and a return spring (38)
comprising an electrical actuator, for moving the needle valve (44) in a first

direction and a second direction to cause the needle valve (44) to contact and
separate from the seat surface and thereby control flow from the outlet

end (24);
a swirl guide (32) having an axially aligned bore (42) through
which the needle valve (44) reciprocates for guiding the motion of the

needle valve (44) 
characterized in that
a damping means (46) is disposed at the outlet end (24);
the valve seat member (30) is disposed between the swirl guide (32)
and said damping means (46); and
said damping means (46), the swirl guide (32), and the valve
seat member (30) are arranged such that said damping means (46)

biases the valve seat member (30) against the needle valve (44) for preventing fuel
seepage between the valve seat member (30) and the needle valve (44) and also

for dampening the impact of the needle valve (44) with the valve seat member (30).

further characterized in that an O-ring (48) is disposed between the swirl

guide and the valve seat member.
