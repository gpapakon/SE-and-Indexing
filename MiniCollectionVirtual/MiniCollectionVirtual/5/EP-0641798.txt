where 


R¹,
R² and R³ in the molecule are identical or different 
and are aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon radicals, 
R⁴

12 carbon atoms and a laterally bonded hydroxyl 

group, where the hydrocarbon radical can be interrupted 
by an ether oxygen, 
R⁵
is a hydrophilic ionic radical. 
Silanes according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that R¹, R² and R³ are alkyl radicals having from 1 to 4 

carbon atoms, where one of these radicals can be replaced 
by a phenyl radical. 
Silanes according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that at least 90% of the radicals R¹, R² and R³ are methyl 

radicals. 
Silanes according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the radical R⁴ is one of 

the radicals  
 


Silanes according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the radical R⁵ is a radical 

of the formula 

 
where 


R⁶,
R⁷ and R⁸ are alkyl radicals having from 1 to 6 
carbon atoms, which can be identical or different in 

the molecule, 
X⁺
is a hydrogen, alkali metal, 1/2 alkaline earth 
metal or an unsubstituted or substituted ammonium 

ion and 
Y⁻
is any anion, preferably halide or acetate ion. 
Process for preparing the compounds according to 
any of Claims 1 to 5, characterized in that 


a) epoxides having an olefinic double bond are added 
onto silanes of the general formula  

 

 
in the presence of a hydrosilylation catalyst and 
b) the silane-modified epoxides obtained are, in a 
manner known per se with opening of the epoxide 

ring, 

b1) sulphonated or 
b2) quaternized by reaction with tertiary amines of 
the formula 


 
in the presence
 of an acid YH or 
b3) converted into the betaine by reaction with a 
compound of the formula 


Process according to Claim 6, characterized in 
that the hydrosilylation is carried out at elevated 

temperature and/or in the presence of a solvent. 
Process according to Claim 6 or 7, characterized 
in that the hydrosilylation is carried out in the presence 

of a platinum catalyst.

to 5 as biodegradable, hydrolysis-stable surfactants in 

water-containing media.
