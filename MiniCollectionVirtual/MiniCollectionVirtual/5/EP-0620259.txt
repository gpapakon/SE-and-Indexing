<ABSTRACT>
Hot melt compositions comprise from 2 to 95 
parts of an epoxy-containing material, correspondingly, 

from about 98 to 5 parts of a polyester component, an 
effective amount of a photoinitiator for radiation 

curing the hot melt composition, and an optional 
hydroxyl-containing material. The hot melt composition 

is a solid at room temperature but can be melted to a 
liquid upon heating. The invention also relate to a 

method of adhesively bonding two substrates together 
using the hot melt compositions.

<DESCRIPTION>
In general, this invention relates to
epoxy/polyester hot melt compositions and, more
particularly, to such compositions which, upon exposure
to radiation, cure to provide a high strength adhesive
having good green strength build-up.Many adhesive and coating compositions are
known, particular advantages and disadvantages being
associated with each. For example, polyester based
moisture curable hot melt compositions are a solid at
room temperature but upon heating melt to a viscous
liquid that can be readily applied to a substrate.
The compositions react with ambient moisture to provide
a cured, crosslinked thermoset adhesive. Because of
their moisture sensitivity, special packaging is
required and care must be taken during processing to
avoid the accumulation of uncured residue that could
react with moisture in the manufacturing equipment.
Furthermore, because of their moisture sensitivity,
these materials cannot be readily provided in film form
and work best when applied to moisture permeable (e.g.
plastic and wood) substrates.Thermally cured hot melt compositions have a
limited pot life because application in the melted
state also initiates the curing reaction. These
compositions typically require elaborate clamping
mechanisms to secure the bonded parts during the
elevated temperature curing cycle and are not
particularly favored for use with heat sensitive
substrates. However, hot melt compositions are desirable
because they are easily used and some formulations do
not require clamps. Moreover, the compositions are
free from solvents.Many well known adhesive and coating
compositions are based on epoxies. Some cure at room
temperature but these are typically two part systems
that require separate inventories of the individual
components which can only be mixed shortly before use.
Such compositions tend to have relatively short pot
lives, are not generally provided in film form, and
frequently require clamps to hold the bonded parts in
place until the compositions cure. Epoxy adhesives are
sought after, however, because of their excellent
ultimate strength and heat resistance.Consequently, it would be desirable to have a
single adhesive composition that is free from as many
of the foregoing disabilities as possible. That is,
there would be a considerable demand for an easily
applied, one part adhesive that is not sensitive to
moisture and which cures quickly to a high strength
structural adhesive but which also has good green
strength build-up so that clamps are not needed to
secure the bonded
