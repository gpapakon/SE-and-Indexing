elutriation, the clay is fixed to the surface of the perlite 
granules by a water-insoluble fixing agent which fixes the clay 

particles. 
A soil conditioner according to Claim 6, characterized in 
that the clay is fixed to the surface of the perlite granules by 

a water-insoluble network of a polymer which binds the clay 
particles.

characterized in that the fixing agent is applied to the clay 

covering. 
A soil conditioner according to one or more of Claims 7 to 
9, characterized in that the fixing agent is present in the form 

of phenyl-terminated polybutadiene in a quantity of more than 3 

g per litre of perlite granules. 
A soil conditioner according to one or more of Claims 1 to 
6 and 8 and 9, characterized in that the clay is fixed to the 

surface of the perlite granules by a ketone formaldehyde in 
combination with cellulose esters. 
A soil conditioner according to one or more of Claims 1 to 
6 and 8 and 9, characterized in that the clay is fixed to the 

surface of the perlite granules by an agent substantially 
containing gelatine. 
A soil conditioner according to one or more of Claims 1 to 
12, characterized in that, to increase the bulk density, it 

contains pumice granules comprising granules of pumice whereof 
the externally accessible surface is also covered with unfired 

clay. 
A soil conditioner according to Claim 13, characterized in 
that the pumice granules are present in a grain size of from 0 

to 4, preferably from 1 to 3, mm. 
A soil conditioner according to Claim 13 and/or 14, 
characterized in that it contains from 10 to 50% by volume of 

pumice granules and from 50 to 90% by volume of perlite granules. 
A soil conditioner according to one or more of Claims 13 to 
15, characterized in that it has a pH value of between 5 and 8.  

 
A soil conditioner according to one or more of Claims 1 to 
16, characterized in that it contains, in and/or on the covering, 

water-containing fine perlite particles, preferably having 
particle sizes which are 99% 
<
 40 µm, in particular 
<
 32 µm, in 
quantities which because of the adsorbed water have a wet density 

which has the effect of increasing the bulk density of the soil 
conditioner. 
A soil conditioner according to Claim 17, characterized in 
that the fine perlite has a dry bulk density of from 70 to 140 

g per litre, a rammed density of from 100 to 200 g per litre and 
a wet density of from 300 to 400 g per litre.

characterized in that the fine perlite is present in a weight 

quantity ratio of clay to fine perlite of from 4:1 to 1.5:1. 
A soil conditioner according to one or more of Claims 17 to 
19, characterized in that it has more than one covering layer of 

clay and fine perlite.

6, and in particular according to one or more of Claims 13 to 20, 

characterized in that the covering is dewatered and calcined. 
A soil conditioner according to Claim 21, characterized in 
that the covering is fixed by a hardened fine perlite melt phase. 
A process for the production of the soil conditioner 
according to one or more of Claims 1 to 22, characterized in that

in quantities of from 0.5 to 5% by weight in relation to the clay 
content of the slip. 
A process according to one or more of Claims 23 to 26, 
characterized in that the clay slip contains a fixing agent which 

acts to prevent the clay from elutriating. 
A process according to Claim 27, characterized in that the 
clay slip contains as the fixing agent a liquid phenyl-terminated 

polybutadiene in a quantity of more than 3 g per litre of perlite 
granules.
