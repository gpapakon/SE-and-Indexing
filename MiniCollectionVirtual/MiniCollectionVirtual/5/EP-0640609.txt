<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to fused phenol derivatives, processes for their 
preparation and pharmaceutical compositions containing them. Animal tissues have a metabolic system called the arachidonic acid 
cascade. Arachidonic acid, which is stored in the form of phospholipid, is 
release by the action of an esterase, phospholipase. Arachidonic acid is converted into 5-hydroxyperoxy-6, 8, 11, 14-eicosatetraenoic 
acid (5-HPETE) by the addition of molecular oxygen by the 
action of 5-lipoxygenase. Part of the peroxy acid 5-HPETE is converted to 
form 5-hydroxy-6, 8, 11, 14-eicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE). Further, 5-HPETE 
is converted into leukotriene A₄ (LTA₄) and leukotriene B₄ (LTB₄). 
Furthermore, LTA₄ is converted into leukotriene C₄ (LTC₄), leukotriene D₄ 
(LTD₄), and leukotriene E₄ (LTE₄). On the other hand, arachidonic acid is converted into prostaglandin 
G₂ (PGG₂) by cyclooxygenase. PGG₂ is converted into prostaglandin H2 
(PGH₂) by PG hydroperoxytase. PGH₂ is converted into thromboxane A₂ 
(TXA₂) by thromboxane (TX) synthetase. It is known that TXA₂ thus obtained 
is very unstable, and therefore, immediately converted into thromboxane B₂ 
(TXB₂).  LTB₄ has migratory and adhesive activities on leukocyte, and 
degranulation activity on leukocyte. LTC₄, LTD₄ and LTE₄ have contractile 
activity on pulmonary and bronchial muscles, and artery. It is known that TXA₂ has platelet aggregation activity, and contractile 
activity on vascular smooth muscle and on bronchial smooth muscle. Recently, energetic investigations relating to lipoxygenase, TX and 
active oxygen species have been carried out. It has become apparent that 
these are related to many kinds of disease. Therefore, investigations 
relating to inhibitors which inhibit their synthesis are considered to be  
 
important for the purpose of treatment of many diseases. In particular, many 
literature references on 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors, TXA₂ synthetase 
inhibitors and oxygen species scavengers have been reported. For example, it is disclosed that the 3,4-dihydro-2H-benzopyran 
derivatives of the formula (X) 
(wherein nX is 1-3, RX is a hetero ring containing nitrogen atom, optionally 
selected from 
in which R1X and R2X each, independently, is hydrogen, alkyl which may 
have substituents, aralkyl, arylalkenyl, allyl or acyl, R3X is hydrogen or alkyl) 
have at least one of an inhibitory activity on 5-lipoxygenase, anti-allergy 
activity, anti-histamine activity, an inhibitory activity on lipid peroxidation and 
an inhibitory activity on platelet
