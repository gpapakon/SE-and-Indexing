<ABSTRACT>
Process for purification and biodeodorisation of a gaseous effluent laden with polluting substances, characterised in that it includes the stages consisting in:   - passing the said gaseous effluent through a bed of inert inorganic granular material acting as support for a biomass consisting of predominantly autotrophic bacteria intended to degrade the said polluting substances,   - spraying the said bed with a spraying liquid, - recovering the purified and biodeodorised gaseous effluent at the exit from the said bed, the nutrient elements necessary for the biomass being supplied entirely by the said spraying liquid and/or by the said gaseous effluent, the unit formed by the said bed of inert inorganic granular material and the said autotrophic biomass making it possible to degrade the said polluting substances by a physicochemical route and by a biological route.
