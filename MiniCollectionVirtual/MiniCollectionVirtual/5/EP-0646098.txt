<ABSTRACT>
The method proposed for increasing the viscosity of water is charcterized in that, for the instantaneous production of increased-viscosity water which does not lose its viscosity characteristics on storage, a slurry is prepared containing 1-9 %, preferably 2-5 %, of high-disperse synthetic, preferably pyrogenic, silicic acid in water with only a small amount of added ethers of fatty alcohols or saccaric alcoohols or esters of fatty acids with poly(ethylene glycol) or poly(propylene glycol) with a molecular weight between 250 and 50,000, at a concentration of 0.005 to 1.5 %, poly(ethylene glycol) or poly(propylene glycol) with a molecular weight between 600 and 50,000 at a concentration of 0.05 to 1.5 %, poly(ethylenimine) at a concentration 
>
 0.003 or poly(N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone) at a concentration of 0.05 to 0.5 %. Characteristic of this system is its marked rheopexic properties which are shown instantaneously under the action of shear forces. Under such conditions, the viscosity increases and a stable, homogeneous terminal state is produced. The increased-viscosity water thus produced can be used as, for instance, a fire extinguishant, a carrier for crop sprays and cleaning agents or as the liquid in water beds.

<CLAIMS>
Process for the preparation of thickened water by 
preparing a sol of 1 - 9% by weight of finely divided 

synthetic, preferably pyrogenic, silica in water with an 
addition of additives, characterized in that the additive 

used is 0.05 - 0.5% by weight of poly(N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone) 
(PVP). 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that PVP is used in admixture with the known additives of 

ethers of fatty alcohols, sugar alcohols, or esters of 
fatty acids of polyethylene glycol or polypropylene 

glycol having molar masses of 
>
 250 - 50,000, of 
polyethylene glycol or polypropylene glycol having molar 

masses of 
>
 600 - 50,000 or of polyethylenimine. 
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that reinforcement of the thickening action is 

achieved by vigorous stirring, action of shear or by 
spraying processes. 
Thickened water, characterized in that it has 
been obtained according to at least one of Claims 1 to 3. 
Use of the thickened water according to Claim 4 
as a binder or carrier substance for colour pigments, 

cleaning agents, crop protection agents, drilling fluids, 
fire extinguishing media or as filling for water bed 

mattresses or seating cushions.
