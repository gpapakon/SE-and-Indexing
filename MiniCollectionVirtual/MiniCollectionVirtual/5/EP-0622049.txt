<ABSTRACT>
What is described herein is a system wherein a common 
handle can be attached to either an endoscopic instrument 

or an open surgical instrument. For instance, a common 
handle may have attached to it an open surgical clip 

applier. Or, this may have attached to it an endoscopic 
clip applier. Or, there may be attached to it an 

endoscopic stapler. Or, there may be attached an open 
stapler. This capability continues across all procedures 

and product lines. What is necessary is that the surgeon 
has on hand, at virtually an instance, the capability of 

converting the procedure from an endoscopic one to an open 
one, or converting one instrument to another without 

having to change an essential part, the handle used in the 
device. With the common handle, also, there can be reuse 

of the handle, with disposal of the cartridge held 
therein. Of course, the cartridge can be either an open 

procedure surgical cartridge or an endoscopic cartridge.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to surgical mechanisms. More
particularly this invention relates to surgical mechanisms
capable of being converted from being useful for open
endoscopic procedures to being useful for procedures at a
moment's notice.Recently, there have been quite a few important
technical advances in the surgical field. Through the
1980's, all of these advances were in the field of open
surgical procedures. That is, the advances in the
surgical field were accomplished in procedures which
involved the cutting open of the body through large
incisions, and the use of medical instruments within this
large incision, with the body open. Thus, these
procedures placed very little emphasis on the size of the
instruments used, because the incision was large and such
instruments could be used in this large volume. The head
size of the instruments (in these cases) were never larger
than the opening.In more recent years, there has been a revolution in
the surgical field to procedures which are accomplished
endoscopically or laparoscopically. These procedures can
be accomplished so that a very small incision is made.
Usually, an incision is made by a trocar so that the
trocar punctures a portion of the body. For instance, in
laparoscopic procedures the abdomen is punctured. 
Thereafter, surgical instruments are inserted through the
trocar cannula so that the procedure can take place
through the trocar and within the "closed" volume of the
body.Necessarily, these latter procedures rely on devices
with reduced size. Because the procedure takes place
through a reduced size incision and a reduced size
cannula, an instrument head must be capable of fitting
through the incision and cannula. In this fashion, an
emphasis has been placed on the head of the device, with
size itself placed at a premium.Until now, endoscopic instruments would generally not
be used in open procedures and, certainly, open procedure
instruments could not be used laparoscopically. Thus, two
separate procedural fields have been created. In fact,
much emphasis has been placed on endoscopic procedures; in
some instances, there have been more advances in
endoscopic procedures as compared to the formerly very
common open procedures.Nonetheless, there remains a recognized need in the
medical community. This need exists in instances where
the surgeon inadvertently causes bleeding during an
endoscopic procedure. When there is this inadvertent
bleeding, it is frequently necessary to convert the
procedure from an endoscopic procedure to an open
procedur

<CLAIMS>
A surgical handle (20) in combination with a plurality
of surgical shafts (15, 50), each of said shafts (15, 50) being

mateable with said surgical handle (20), and at least a first one
of said shafts (15, 50) being useful for accomplishing a step in an

endoscopic procedure, characterised in that a second one of
said shafts (15, 50) provides a functionality which is different from

the functionality provided by said first shaft, said second
shaft being useful for accomplishing one of a different step

in said procedure or a step in an open surgical procedure.
The combination of claim 1 wherein one of said shafts
enables a stapling step.
The combination of claim 1 wherein one of said shafts
enables a ligating step.
The combination of claim 1 wherein one of said shafts
enables a grasping step.
The combination of claim 1 wherein one of said shafts
enables a dissecting step.
The combination of claim 1 wherein one of said shafts
enables a cutting step.
The combination of claim 1 wherein one of said shafts
is circular.
The combination of claim 1 wherein one of said shafts
enables an adhesion step.
