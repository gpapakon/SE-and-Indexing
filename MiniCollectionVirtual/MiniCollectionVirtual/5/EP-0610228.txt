<CLAIMS>
p-Channel transistor having a drain electrode 
(12), a source electrode (13) and a gate electrode (16), 

the drain electrode (12) and the source electrode (13) 
being constructed as p-regions in an n-well (10) and the 

n-well (10) itself being embedded in a surrounding p-region 
(11), the drain electrode (12) being connected to 

the positive pole (U
+
) of an operating voltage, the 
source electrode (13) being connected to the n-well (10) 

via an ohmic contact (17, 18), and the gate electrode 
(16) being connected to a potential U
G
 
<
 U
+
 - ¦U
TH
¦ which 
is lower than the positive potential (U
+
) of the operating 
voltage, U
TH
 being the threshold voltage of the p-channel. 
Transistor according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the p-region of the source electrode (13) is contacted 

with an n
+
-region (17) in the well (10). 
Transistor according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the n
+
-region (17) spatially adjoins the p-region of 
the source electrode (13). 
Transistor according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the drain electrode (12) is 

contacted with a conductor track (21) which is connected 
to the positive pole (U
+
) of the operating voltage. 
Transistor according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the gate electrode (16) is connected to a frame. 
Transistor according to Claim 1 or 5, characterized 
in that the gate electrode (16) is contacted with a 

p
+
-region (20) in the P-insulation region (11). 
Transistor according to Claim 1 or 5, characterized  
 

in that the gate electrode (16) is contacted with a 
conductor track connected to a frame.
