<ABSTRACT>
A hydraulic controller of an automatic transmission 
(AT) for vehicles have an integrated valve. The integrated 

valve has a cylindrical cam shaft including convex and concave 
parts on the outer periphery thereof, and connected to a motor 

for automatic control and a connecting part which is 
interlocked with an outer select lever to be operated by a 

driver. The integrated valve is of such structure that 
hydraulic control thereof is made in two different wa
ys of 
automatic control and manual control, and whereby, even if the 

automatic control is dysfunctioned due to an error, the manual 
control can maintain the control of the AT and avoid any 

inconvenience. The structure of this integrated valve has 
high degree of freedom, and can comply with any AT to be used. 

Accordingly, a light, compact and reliable AT equipped with 
both an automatic control mechanism and an manual control 

mechanism can be provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a hydraulic 
controller for automatic transmissions that hydraulically 
controls the speed change mechanism of automatic 
transmissions. More particularly, the present invention 
relates to a hydraulic controller for automatic transmissions 
for vehicles. Conventionally, an automatic transmission (AT) widely 
used for vehicles to smoothly transmit torque according to 
loads has achieved speed change control by means of a 
hydraulic circuit mounted with a plurality of dispersed 
hydraulic control valves, accumulators and solenoid valves. 
Therefore, the conventional AT is large in size and number of 
parts and components, complicated in structure and high in 
cost. In order to solve these problems of being large and 
complicated, an idea has been proposed, as disclosed in the 
Japanese Examined Patent Publication (Koukoku) No. 4-77183, 
that speed change is controlled by one integrated control 
valve. This idea can downsize, lighten and simplify the 
hydraulic controller for the conventional AT. If the oil pressure is to be directly varied to 
control the oil pressure of each friction engaging element, as 
many hydraulic control valves as the number of the friction  
 
engaging elements within the AT are required, and so much so 
that the hydraulic controller becomes larger and less 
economical. For this reason, the integrated valve is used for 
hydraulic control. In order to achieve the proper oil pressure 
distribution according to the engagement state of the required 
friction engaging elements, automatic speed change is achieved 
by smoothly switching the oil pressure with minimum number of 
the hydraulic control valves as possible by using the 
hydraulic valves of the integrated valve and by further 
switching the hydraulic valves with a hydraulic control means. In a system in which dispersed hydraulic control 
valves control each friction engaging element for speed change 
control, speed change control is achieved by specifying the 
speed change instruction (which selects friction engaging 
elements within an AT to obtain the proper gear ratio) by an 
operation of a selector lever (which a driver can select the 
desirable gear position freely to some extent) and an engine 
control computer (electronic control unit, ECU) based on an 
opening of an engine throttle and vehicle speed. In this 
case, it is taken into consideration that, even if the 
automatic control function of the ECU should be failed, due to 
an ECU fail-safe system and others, a driver can
