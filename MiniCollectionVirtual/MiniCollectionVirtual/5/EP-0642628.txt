Double pump with following features: 

a radial-flow plunger pump (1) and a vane pump (2) combined to 
form a pump unit; 
a single shaft (6) drives both pumps; 
the housing (4) of the radial-flow plunger pump (1) surrounds a 
ring insert (8) which contains the pump plungers (11); 
a pump package consisting of a rotor (20) vanes (21) and curved 
ring (22) seals front plates lying on both sides of the pump 

package (24), 
characterized in that
 the ring insert (8) and the 
front plate (face 23) of the vane pump (2) facing the radial-flow 

plunger pump (1) form a single component. 
Double pump as per Claim 1,
characterized in that
 the ring insert (8) has an 
axial bore (36) for supporting the shaft (6). 
Double pump as per Claim 1,
characterized in that
 the ring insert (8) forms 
a thrust face (38) for the shaft (6) in the area of the radial-flow 

plunge pump (1) cam (12). 
Double pump as per Claim 1,
characterized in that
 a pin (broken line 40) 
passes through the ring insert (8), the curved ring (22) and the front 

plate (24) facing the radial-flow plunger pump to prevent pump 
components twisting in the housing (7). 
Double pump as per Claim 1,
characterized in that
 the ring insert (8) is made 
from sinter metal. 
Double pump as per Claim 1,
characterized in that
 the ring insert (8) is made 
from aluminium die-cast.
