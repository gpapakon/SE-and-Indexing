<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of manufacturing bodies 
with improved fracture toughness by means of hot-isostatic 
pressing/isostatic pressure sintering, in the form of composites 
in which long fibres are arranged in a matrix of 
ceramic. More specifically, the invention refers 
to a method of manufacturing fibre-reinforced composites, 
wherein a fibrous material, in the form of long fibre 
thread comprising a large number of fibres, a single long 
fibre, a mono-filament, or a fibre fabric is infiltrated 
with material from which a ceramic matrix is built up, said 
infiltrated fibrous material is preformed into a green 
body, said preformed green body is encapsulated, said encapsulated 
green body is consolidated and sintered by means 
of isostatic pressure sintering. In many demanding applications, such as components for gas 
turbines, rocket engines and other types of structural members 
for which a high reliability is required, a brittle 
fracture behaviour is unacceptable. Brittle materials often 
lead to fracture without plastic deformation having preceded 
the fracture, or if the breaking stress is locally 
exceeded following the stress concentration which arises  
 
near a microcrack or other defect. This reduces the possibility 
of detecting faulty parts by inspection or estimating 
service lives by statistical methods and replacing 
these parts prior to a breakdown. The above applies preferably to ceramics which are very 
strong but for which the strength is reduced and the variation 
in strength values between individuals becomes great 
as a consequence of the inability of absorbing stresses by 
plastic deformation as well as the occurrence of internal 
defects in the form of microcracks and other inhomogeneities. 
Thus, they result in fracture when the weakest link 
breaks. The same is also true of certain metallic materials, 
preferably in high-temperature applications, where 
changes in the microstructure as a result of diffusin and 
grain growth increase the tendency to brittle fracture behaviour.  
 One way of avoiding brittle fractures is to reinforce with 
fibres. Fibre reinforcement gives greater fracture toughness 
and safety against fracture because when the strength is 
locally exceeded, the fracture does not propagate spontaneously 
through the part but the fibres take up and redistribute 
the stresses in the same way as when one of a large 
number of parallel-connected links breaks. In this way, 
defects can be detected and critical components be replaced 
during a regular
