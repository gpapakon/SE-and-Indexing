<ABSTRACT>
An embodiment of the present invention 
includes a GPS receiver capable of concurrently 

tracking up to eight GPS satellites. The GPS 
receiver comprises computer-implemented methods 

for parallel search, split search and 
precomputation. The parallel search method 

causes the apparent Doppler frequency spectrum 
to be sectioned into several segments and a 

first GPS satellite signal is searched for in 
parallel in each of the segments. When the 

first GPS fix is not found after a predetermined 
time has expired, a split search is begun.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for searching for
acquisition of a signal from a GPS satellite with a multiple
channel GPS receiver according to the preamble of claim 1
and to a multiple channel GPS receiver according to the
preamble of claim 4.Global positioning system receivers use
signals received from typically three or more
overhead satellites to determine navigational
data such as position and velocity, and such
systems may also provide altitude and time. GPS
signals are available worldwide at no cost and
can be used to determine the location of a
vehicle, such as an automobile, to within one
city block, or better. Dual-frequency carrier
GPS receivers typically track a pair of radio
carriers, L1 and L2, associated with the GPS
satellites to generate accumulated delta-range
measurements (ADR) from P-code modulation on
those carrier frequencies and at the same time
track L1 C/A-code to generate code phase
measurements. Carrier frequency L1 is allocated
to 1575.42 MHz and carrier frequency L2 is
positioned at 1227.78 MHz. Less expensive
receivers tune only one carrier frequency, and
therefore do not have adequate information to
compute the local ionospheric delays that will
appear as position errors. At such frequencies,
radio carrier signals travel by line-of-sight. 
Thus buildings, mountains and the horizon can
block reception.The constellation of GPS satellites in
orbit about the earth presently comprises
approximately seventeen individual satellites.
Each transmits one of thirty-two unique
identifying codes in a code multiple access
arrangement. This allows all of the many GPS
satellites to transmit in spread spectrum mode
at the same frequency (plus or minus a Doppler
frequency shift of that frequency as results
from the satellite's relative velocity).
Particular satellites are sorted out of a
resulting jumble of signals and noise by
correlating a 1023 "chip" code to one of the
thirty-two pseudo random number (PRN) sequence
codes that are preassigned to individual GPS
satellites. These codes are not necessarily
being transmitted in phase with one another.
Therefore, "finding" a GPS satellite initially
involves searching various carrier frequencies,
to account for Doppler frequency shift and
oscillator inaccuracies, and searching for a
code match, using 1023 different code phases and
twenty or more possible correlation code
templates.In large cities with many tall buildings,
one or more of the GPS satellites being tracked
by a particular receiver, may be temporarily
blocked. In some situations,

A method for searching for acquisition of a signal from
a GPS satellite with a multiple channel GPS receiver

having a local oscillator with a frequency uncertainty,
wherein a Doppler frequency search range is divided into

ranges and each range is searched in parallel by a
separate receiver channel, and wherein Almanac data is

stored before a signal interruption,
the method comprising the steps of:


pre-computing a table of pseudo random number (PRN)
codes associated with GPS satellites predicted to be

visible at a plurality of times in the future based on
said almanac for current time and the GPS satellites and

a predetermined geographic position of the GPS receiver,
and
fetching a PRN code from said table according to a time
said GPS receiver is repowered up after a period of non-operation

that followed the step of pre-computing said

searching for a signal from a first GPS satellite
associated with said fetched PRN code in parallel using

said multiple channels of said GPS receiver such that a
first search range is positioned with a nominal

frequency for said GPS satellite signal at its mid-point
and a first channel is appointed to search said first

search range and a second channel is appointed to search
in parallel a second search range adjacent to said first

search range, and
splitting said multiple channels between searching for
said first GPS satellite and a second GPS satellite if 

said first GPS satellite signal was not found.
The method of claim 1 or 2, wherein the pre-computing of
said table includes ephemeris information obtained

previous to said period of non-operation and said table
extends forward in time for period limited by the

validity of said ephemeris information.
