uniaxial stretching, (5) the ratio of sample diameter to

initial sample diameter and the time for sample breakage
during uniaxial stretching under a constant tension,

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel ethylene (co)polymer,
and laminate and hollow molding or blow molded products made
by using the same. More particularly, this invention relates
to an ethylene (co)polymer which is excellent in mechanical
strengths such as impact resistance, moldability, etc. and
applicable to extrusion molding, injection molding, blow
molding, etc., which is excellent for use in large blow molded
products required of drawdown resistance, puncture
resistance, parison thickness controllability (parison
control response), pinch-off properties, durability, etc.,
in particular excellent in fire resistance required for fuel
tanks, to hollow moldings, laminates and hollow multilayer
moldings made by using the same.Generally, detergent bottles, food containers such as
beverage bottles and vegetable oil bottles, large vessels
such as drum cans and industrial cans, fuel containers such 
as kerosene cans and gasoline tanks, spoilers, bumpers and
the like are produced by a blow molding process. The blow
molding process is to pinch with a mold a cylindrically
extruded parison composed of a melted resin, blowing air into
the parison to blow up and change the shape of it so as to
conform to the shape of the cavity of the mold, and then cooling
it.The blow molding process is widely utilized since it
is applicable widely to large fuel tanks having complicated
shapes, drums, and further panel-like moldings as well as
hollow moldings such as bottles and since molding is simple
and molding costs covering molds are inexpensive.Recently, in the field of large vessels such as drum
cans and large containers, substitution by plastics is being
carried forward positively taking into consideration freedom
in shape, economy, safety, and adaptability to environmental
problems.It is also the case in the field of automobile industry
such as fuel tanks, bumpers and spoilers. Particularly in
the field of fuel tanks, substitution by plastics proceeds
remarkably along with the development of fuel permeation
preventing technology by a co-extrusion technology, a sealer
technology, a continuous multi-ply technology, etc.When large products are blow molded, a phenomenon that
a parison droops down due to its own weight (drawdown) tends
to occur. To make the drawdown small, it has been known to 
use a resin having sufficiently high viscosity and melt
tension.In molding hollow moldings having a complicated shape,
there tends to occur a local increase in blow ratio to cause
puncture or local thinning of a parison. To prevent the
