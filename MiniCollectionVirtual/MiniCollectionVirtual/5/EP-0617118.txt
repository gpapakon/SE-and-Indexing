<DESCRIPTION>
Forging of metals, as relates to this invention, is the process whereby 
solid metal is deformed under pressure by means of dies or tools, in one or several 
stages resulting in the final shape and size of the metal conforming to that of the dies 
or tools, or a cross section thereof. Such processes are described as hammer or drop 
forging or stamping, press forging, warm forging, cold forging, isothermal forging, hot 
or warm forwards and/or backwards extrusion, cold forwards and/or backwards 
extrusion, hot or warm or cold drawing, hot or warm or cold pressing and hot or warm 
or cold deep drawing. Forging or extrusion operations are generally described as 
falling into one of three broad areas, namely hot forging, warm forging and cold 
forging. The term "forming" is synonymous with "forging" in the following context. Hot forging or forming generally describes processes of deformation of 
a metal workpiece pre-heated to a temperature where it is ductile and malleable and 
such that the deformation will not work harden the metal. Typically for example, these 
temperatures range in the case of ferrous alloys and steels from 760°C to 1350°C, and 
for aluminum alloys from 315°C to 500°C. Warm forming takes place at temperatures below the normal hot-working 
ranges and offers certain advantages over both hot and cold forming, in that there can 
be significant reductions in forming loads as compared with cold forming, while the  
 
problems of scaling, due to oxidation, and decarburization of steels encountered in hot 
forging, can be eliminated. Lubrication can be more effective than with hot forging 
and the dies can be made to higher tolerances producing forgings of greater accuracy, 
thus reducing the need for final machining operations. Typical temperatures for warm 
forging steel alloys are in the range of 650°C to 850°C. Cold forging is the forming of metal at ambient temperatures by force 
between dies or by pushing or drawing through dies in the case of extrusions. With 
little thermal change in dimensions, lack of scale or oxide formation and no 
decarburization of steels occurring, cold forming can produce components to a high 
dimensional precision. In all the above forging processes a lubricant is required to reduce 
friction between the workpiece and the die. Reduced friction means that the forging 
loads will be lowered, because the metal can flow and conform to the die shape more 
easily, wear on the die and tools will be reduced, giving longer lives and lower 
operating costs and, just as
