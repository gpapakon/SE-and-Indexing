<ABSTRACT>
A reinforcing fiber sheet (1) permitting reinforcement 
of a concrete structure with a smaller number of layers than 

conventional reinforcing fiber sheets, and which fractures 
within a range of yielding of conventional concrete 

reinforcing bars, comprises high-elasticity and high-elongation 
carbon fibers (4) having a modulus of elasticity of 

at least 35 ton/mm² and a fracture elongation of at least 
0.9%. The fibers are arranged in an amount of at least 250 

g/m² in one direction through an adhesive layer (3) on a 
substrate sheet (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a reinforcing fiber sheet
and structure reinforced thereby.More particularly the invention concerns a reinforcing
fiber material for use in reinforcing a concrete structure by
sticking same on the concrete structure and impregnating the
fiber with a resin, particularly a reinforcing fiber sheet
prepared by arranging carbon fiber on a substrate sheet in one
direction. The invention comprehends a concrete structure
having a reinforcing layer of a fiber-reinforced composite
material using such a reinforcing fiber sheet on the surface
thereof.It is a conventional practice to reinforce or repair a
concrete structure, such as a pier of a bridge for automobiles
or trains, or a beam or a column of a building, with a fiber-reinforced
composite material.Conventional reinforcement has usually been to use a
fiber-reinforced composite material prepared by sticking a
prepreg to the surface of a concrete structure and curing the
prepreg. However, the prepreg has had troublesome storage-related
problems leading to inability to cure properly or at
all, and difficulties in execution including difficult cutting
into desired size and shape at the reinforcing site.The present applicant has therefore developed a
reinforcing fiber sheet as a reinforcing material permitting
reinforcement with a fiber-reinforced composite material for
easy application onto the surface of a concrete structure
without the need for troublesome storage as in a prepreg, and
has proposed the reinforcing fiber sheet and a method of
reinforcement with the use thereof (Japanese Patent
Application Laid Open Nos. 3-222,734, 3-224,901, etc.).The proposed reinforcing fiber sheet as described
above comprises reinforcing fibers arranged, for example, in
one orientation via an adhesive layer on a substrate sheet.
To reinforce a concrete structure, the reinforcing sheet is
stuck onto the surface of a portion of the concrete structure
to be reinforced and then a resin impregnated into the fiber
either before or after application to said surface is cured,
to convert the reinforcing fiber sheet into a fiber-reinforced
resin composite material.According to this reinforcing fiber sheet, excellent
effects are available, including absence of storage problems
as in a prepreg, simple handling at a reinforcing site, and
easy execution on the surface of a concrete structure. Since a reinforcing bar arranged in a concrete
structure yields with a strain of only about 0.15 to 0.20%,
in the case where the concrete structure is continuously
loaded it
