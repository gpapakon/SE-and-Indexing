<ABSTRACT>
A biodegradable polymeric multiphasic release system of one or more biodegradable bursting units capable of delivering biologically active substances in a burst or pulse at predetermined times and a method for constructing those units is disclosed. The individual bursting units of the system may take the form of a biodegradable, membrane coated capsule (12) surrounding a core material which may include an active agent. The membrane ruptures after a predetermined time upon exposure to water or bodily, or other aqueous environmental fluids. The bursting units may be used in any situation in which a controlled pulsed release of an active substance is desired. The predetermined time release of each bursting unit is controlled by the composition of the core material, the initial radius and wall thickness of the membrane and the porosity of the membrane. The core material may also contain a chemical composition which generates gas as fluid is drawn into the bursting unit thus adding an additional design variable for predetermined bursts. A cylindrical bursting unit (10) of the invention describes biodegradable, biocompatible cylinder (open ended) shell (12) or capsule filled with a bioactive agent or other carrier/core components (14). A polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PGLA) copolymer membrane (16), fastened with a medical grade adhesive (such as ''silastic'') (20).

<DESCRIPTION>
 5 BIODEGRADABLE BURSTING RELEASE SYSTEMFIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to delivery systems of biologically active substances, and more particularly to bursting release systems capable of delivering substances in 10 a burst or pulse at predetermined times.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION There are a variety of situations in which it is advantageous to have a system for delivering biologically active substances in bursts or pulses at predetermined times 15 without human or mechanical intervention.For example, some hormones only exhibit their effect if they are administered in pulses. At the present time, patients and laboratory animals, in order to be administered periodic pulses of hormones, wear hormone pumps that are20 programmed to inject hormones at particular intervals. These pump-like devices are subject to leaks, require maintenance, and are cumbersome. By reason of their size, they are unsuitable for rats, mice and other small laboratory animals.A small implantable, bioco patible and biodegradable25 system which would make the controlled administration of bioactive agents to both animals and man, easier, less painful, and less time consuming, and which additionally is less cumbersome than the portable pumps, is therefore desirable.30 For example, in a classical immunization procedure, which may achieve short-term immunity, a single dose of antigen is delivered in one injection. Antigen initially is present at a high level for a short time, but is soon lostâ–º from the inoculation site. However, with repeated 35 treatments, a strengthened immune response is evoked which- may impart lasting immunity. An implantable, biocompatible and biodegradable polymeric system for immunization offers several attractive features. Such a controlled release 

system would deliver a second burst of antigen at a predetermined amount of time following a first burst. The second burst would elicit a secondary immune response without the need for a second or third booster vaccination. Another example in which a controlled pulsed release of a bioactive substance would be desirable is in the distribution of pesticides on, for example farm land. In some cases, it is desirable to release some insecticides or insect pheromones in response to rain. This is desirable because many insect pests hatch shortly after rain, when fields are too wet for farmers to enter with tractors to spread pesticides. Thus, rather than apply unnecessary pesticides continuously, thereby possibly killing helpful insects and spiders, a
