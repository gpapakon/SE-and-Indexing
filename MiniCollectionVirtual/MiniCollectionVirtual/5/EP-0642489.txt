 CYCIΛPEWΓANE AND CYOOPENTENE DERIVATIVES WITH ANΠA LERGIC ANTIINFLAMMATORY AND TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR INHIBITING ACTIVITYField of Invention The present invention relates to novel cyclopentane and cyclopentene derivatives, pharmaceutical compositions containing these compounds and their use in treating allergic and inflammatory diseases, and for inhibiting the production of Tumo Necrosis Factor (TNF).Background of the Invention Bronchial asthma is a complex, multifactorial disease characterized by reversible narrowing of the airway and hyperreactivity of die respiratory tract to external stimuli.It is now understood that the symptoms of chronic asthma are the manifestations of three distinct processes: 1) an early response to antigen, 2) a delaye or late response to antigen, and 3) chronic inflammation and airway hyperreactivity. Cockcroft, Ann. Allergy 55:857-862, 1985; Larsen, Hosp. Practice 22:113-127, 1987.The agents currently available (b-adrenoceptor agonists, steroids, methylxanthines, disodium cromoglycate) are inadequate to control the disease; none of them modify all three phases of asthma and nearly all are saddled with limiting side effects. Most importantly, none of the agents, with the possible exception of steroids, alter the course of progression of chronic asthma.Identification of novel therapeutic agents for asthma is made difficult by the fact that multiple mediators are responsible for the development of disease. Thus, it seems unlikely that eliminating the effects of a single mediator will have a substantial effect on all three components of chronic asthma. An alternative to the "mediator approach" is to regulate the activity of the cells responsible for the pathophysiology of the disease.One such way is by elevating levels of cAMP (adenosine cyclic 3',5'- monophosphate). Cyclic AMP has been shown to be a second messenger mediating the biologic responses to a wide range of hormones, neurotransmitters and drugs (RobisonSI si-, Cyclic AMP Academic Press, New York, pgs. 17-47, 1971; Krebs Endocrinology Proceedings of the 4th International Congress Excerpta Medica. pgs. 17-29, 1973). When the appropriate agonist binds to specific cell sulface receptors, adenylate cyclase is activated which converts Mg2+-ATP to cAMP at an accelerated rate. The actions of cAMP are terminated by cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs), which hydrolyze the 3'-phosphodiester bond to form 5 -AMP, an inactive metabolite.T.TUTE SHEET 

 Cyclic AMP modulates the activity of most, if not all, of the cells that
