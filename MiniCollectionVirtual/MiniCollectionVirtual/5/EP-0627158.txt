<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus and method is disclosed for 
cultivating soil and turf by utilization of pressurized 

liquid injected into the soil and turf. A roller 
assembly (33) is provided for applying mechanical 

pressure to the turf after cultivation. Further, a 
means for setting a first speed in a transport mode and 

a second speed in a cultivating mode is provided. The 
apparatus is designed to be bidirectional to allow the 

apparatus to be used in both a forward and reverse 
direction. The apparatus is such that, in use, there 

is created a water hammer effect which is sufficient to 
effect the flow of liquid out of the nozzles in the 

form of a square wave pulse.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to an
apparatus for cultivating turf and more particularly to an
apparatus which utilizes the discharge of a high
pressure fluid to cultivate and aerate turf.Turfgrasses are utilized for functional, recreational
and aesthetic purposes, including, but not limited to, the
playing surfaces of turf facilities among them golf
courses, parks, sports fields, cemeteries, highway rights
of ways and industrial and home lawns. While this
specification will discuss turf maintenance specifically
with respect to golf course greens, it is to be understood
that these maintenance problems exist with all turf
surfaces.Intensive use of a turf area and maintenance
operations often result in turf wear and soil compaction.
This compaction reduces large, or macro, pore space and
total pore space in the soil which in turn reduces water
infiltration into the soil, percolation through the soil,
and drainage through the soil; limits exchange of soil
gases, especially soil oxygen, with the atmosphere; and
tends to restrict and reduce root growth and development of
turfgrasses, for example, causing, in some cases,
substantial reduction of the root system and often death of
deeper roots.The proper cultivation of turf to enhance drainage,
and thereby thorough root growth, and improve the soil-air-water
relationship has long been a problem within the
industry, and a great number of devices have been proposed
in the past in an effort to find a solution.Core cultivation (aerification) is widely utilized as
a long-term program to alleviate compacted conditions in
the soil root zone. Several different types of core 
cultivation equipment are available commercially. One such
type is the Toro Greensarator. Core cultivation equipment
utilize vertically operating hollow metal tines which are
forcibly driven into the turf to a depth of 2-1/2 to 3
inches (6.35 to 7.62cm) to extract a plug, or core, of the
turf which is then deposited on the turf surface of the
green. (In some instances the cores are collected and
removed from the green).Research has shown that core cultivation creates a
serious problem. Repeatedly forcing the metal tines into
the turf to a common depth will, over time, create a
compacted subsurface layer of soil, sometimes called plow
sole, at a depth about one inch (2.54 cm) deeper than the
length of the tines, in other words at about 3-1/2 to 4
inches (8.89 to 10.16 cm) below the surface of the turf.
Further, the metal tines also tend to glaze the soil and
create some compaction along the

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus (10) for cultivating turf by
hydraulic action, comprising:


(a) a frame (11);
(b) means operatively connected to said frame
(11) for propelling said apparatus (10) over the turf

and soil to be cultivated;
(c) a plurality of fluid nozzles (55) operatively
connected to said frame (11), each of said nozzles (55)

having input and output ports;
(d) means for pressurizing liquid operatively
connected to said frame (11), said nozzles (55) being

in fluid communication with said pressurizing means,
said pressurizing means having suitable flow on and

flow off duration times;
(e) means for providing a source of liquid to be
in fluid communication with said pressurizing means;
(f) means for controlling flow of the liquid from
said pressurizing means to said inlet ports, whereby

the liquid exits said outlet ports at a pressure
sufficient to cause the liquid to penetrate the turf

and create cultivation holes; and
(g) a manifold (54) having an inlet in fluid
communication with said pressurizing means;

characterised in that:

(1) each of said nozzle outlet ports has a cross-sectional
area with a diameter of from about 0.838mm to

about 2.286mm(about 0.033 inch to about 0.090 inch);
(2) said pressurizing means provides a flow of
liquid from about 15,858 kPa to about 37,922 kPa (about

2300 psi to about 5500 psi);
(3) said manifold (54) has an elongate bore (54a)
in fluid communication with said nozzles (55); and
(4) the cross-sectional area of the bore (54a) is
sized in relationship to the pressure and an

accumulation of the cross-sectional area of the nozzle 
outlet ports, wherein a water hammer effect is created

which is sufficient to effect the flow of liquid out of
the nozzles (55) more in the order of a square wave

pulse and the water hammer effect is not enough to
destroy the manifold (54), wherein the relationship of

the pressure (P), the cross-sectional area (A

bore (54a) and the accumulated area (A

ports of the nozzles (55) is given by the following:
