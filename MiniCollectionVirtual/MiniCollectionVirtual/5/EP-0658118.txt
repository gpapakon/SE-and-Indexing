<ABSTRACT>
An immunogenic conjugate comprising a modified group C meningococcal polysaccharide (GCMP) coupled to a carrier molecule. The GCMP is modified by O-deacetylation to a varying extent. This modified GCMP conjugate stimulates a strong immunogenic response. The antiserum, produced by immunization with this conjugate, is cross-reactive with the native polysaccharide. In addition, these antisera elicit a class of antibodies that have potent bactericidal activity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the preparation
of vaccines useful against group C Neisseria meningitidis
wherein these vaccines comprise conjugates of modified
group C capsular polysaccharides.Group C Neisseria meningitidis is the cause of a
large percentage of bacterial meningitidis worldwide.
Current measures to prevent this disease consist of
vaccines composed of purified group C capsular
polysaccharide. These vaccines are effective in adults but
are poorly immunogenic in children. The poor results in
infants is highly undesirable since this section of the
population has the highest incidence of these infections.The group C meningococcal polysaccharide (GCMP)
is a weak immunogen and, hence, there have been efforts to
enhance the immunogenicity of these polysaccharides to
expand their usefulness as vaccines. One possible method
of achieving this goal, which has shown some promise is by
conjugation of these polysaccharides to a carrier, such as
a protein.Various investigators have isolated and purified
intact capsular polysaccharides and have covalently
coupled them to carrier proteins. These conjugates are
more immunogenic than the polysaccharide alone. Many
examples can be found in the literature which illustrate
the success of these conjugate antigens. One such
example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,673,574 describes the use of
bacterial capsular polysaccharides conjugated to carrier
proteins to form immunogenic compounds. Another example, 
U.S. Pat. No. 4,356,170 describes the immunogenicity of
conjugates consisting of a specific polysaccharide, group
A meningococcal polysaccharide (GAMP) coupled to a carrier
protein. These conjugates provide an improved method for
delivering effective levels of antigen to a host.Another method for increasing immunogenicity has
shown promise with the group B meningococcal
polysaccharide (GBMP) antigens, as seen in U.S. Pat. No.
4,727,136. This method entails the replacement of N-acetyl
groups of the sialyl moiety of the polysaccharide
with N-propenyl groups followed by conjugation of the
modified polysaccharide to a carrier protein. These
conjugates are good immunogens and effectively cross-react
with the native GBMP. This finding demonstrates that the
addition of substituents onto the polysaccharide antigen
can create additional immunogenic sites or epitopes for
recognition by antibodies.Vaccines which are currently prepared from O-acetyl-positive
group C N. meningitidis are known to be
poorly immunogenic. There have been reports that vaccine
derived from an O-acetyl-negative
