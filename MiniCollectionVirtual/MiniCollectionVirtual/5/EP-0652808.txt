<ABSTRACT>
A process is disclosed for manufacturing paper web containing a CF layer for pressure sensitive recording paper. In order to ensure full sizing, the paper web (1) is subjected to intermass sizing and the coating ink (4) containing colour acceptors constituted of colour-reactive, mineral pigments is applied with a coating device in which the paper web (1) is guided between two transfer rollers (2, 2') separated by a gap or set at minimal pressure. One of the transfer rollers applies volumetrically pre-dosed coating ink (4) by means of a rotary and driven surface-profiled doctor bar (3'), forming the CF layer (4') on one side of the paper web (1), and the other transfer roller at the same time applies a volumetrically pre-dosed aqueous solution (5) on the other side of the paper web, also by means of a rotary driven surface-profiled doctor bar (3). The amount of colour-reactive pigment in the dried CF-layer is comprised between 3.5 and 5g/m2.
