<CLAIMS>
A photoelectric length or angle measuring device with grating graduations movable
relative to one another, of which at least one is in the form of a transmission phase

grating, which has graduation structures spaced from one another, wherein the graduation
structures (T) have a refractive index differing from that of the graduation carrier (M) and

the refractive index of the graduation carrier material is altered in these regions by
physical and/or chemical processes, characterized in that the surface of the transmission

phase grating has a flat protective layer which is in the form of a diffusion barrier layer.
A photoelectric length or angle measuring device according to claim 1, characterized in
that the phase grating (M) is produced according to one of the known methods:


ion exchange
proton exchange
ion implantation
crystallisation processes
orientation of molecules - molecule chains.
A photoelectric length or angle measuring device according to claim 1, characterized in
that the phase grating (M) has a so-called super-structure.
A photoelectric length or angle measuring device according to claim 1, characterized in
that the phase grating has a grating structure on parallel surfaces (O).
A photoelectric length or angle measuring device according to claim 1, characterized in
that the protective layer is applied to the transmission phase grating by means of a dipping

process.
A photoelectric length or angle measuring device according to claim 1, characterized in
that the protective layer is applied to the transmission phase grating by means of thin film

technologies.
