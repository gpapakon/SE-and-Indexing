<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for sterilizing a fine powder comprises a 
tubular sterilizing duct 13 and a heating jacket for heating 

the duct 13 to a sterilizing temperature. A feed hopper 11 
and feed screw 12 are provided for introducing fine powder 

at one end of the duct 13 and an insulated hopper 16 is 
provided for collecting fine powder from the other end of 

the duct 13. Air introduction means is provided at one end 
of the duct 13 for fluidising powder in the duct 13. In the 

method, the duct 13 is heated to a temperature of 
approximately 500°C and fine powder is introduced at one end 

of the duct 13 and removed from the other end of the duct 13 
with a duct residence time sufficient to heat the powder to 

above 120°C. Air is introduced into the duct 13 at a rate 
of 30-60 litres per minute.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus and method for
sterilizing fine powders such as talcum powder.Talcum powder for personal use requires sterilization
to kill potentially harmful organisms. One prior art
sterilization method comprises placing a bulk quantity of
talcum powder in a vacuum chamber, evacuating the air, and
subsequently flooding the chamber with ethylene dioxide.
This method is effective but has the disadvantage that under
certain conditions ethylene dioxide may be explosive; to
counter this threat it has become common to mix a quantity
of CFC's (chloro-fluoro carbons) with the ethylene dioxide.
Current legislation to limit the use of CFC's is rendering
this method of sterilization less desirable, and may
eventually force manufacturers and processors to cease using
the method.Radiation might as an alternative be used to sterilize
talcum powder but this method is rather expensive, and
requires close control of the process and skilled staff.Another method of sterilization is to use heat, but a
heat process must be designed to ensure that no relatively
cool pockets of unsterilized material remain, for otherwise
the process may serve only to encourage multiplication of
dangerous organisms. Furthermore the temperature must not
be so great as to cause burning or degradation of the
powder.It has been suggested to use an air conveyor to carry 
powder through a duct sufficiently hot to give effective
sterilization. However an airspeed of around fifteen metres
per second is required to carry the powder, and this results
in an excessively long duct if temperatures are to be kept
at a reasonable level. The shorter the duct, the higher the
temperature required. In any event sterilization times are
measured in seconds rather than minutes, thus requiring very
close control of the process if effective sterilization
without powder degradation is to be achieved.The apparatus and method of the present invention
provides for heat sterilization in an effective manner with
a relatively long residence time and without the risk of
powder degradation at excessive temperatures.According to one aspect of the invention there is
provided apparatus for sterilizing a fine powder and
comprising a tubular sterilizing duct, means for heating the
duct to a sterilizing temperature, means for introducing
fine powder at one end of the duct and for collecting fine
powder from the other end of the duct, and air introduction
means at one end of the duct for fluidising powder in said
duct.In a preferred embodiment the heating

Apparatus for sterilising a fine powder
and comprising a tubular sterilising duct (13), means

for heating the duct to a sterilising temperature,
means (11,12) for introducing fine powder at one end of

the duct and for collecting the fine powder from the
other end of the duct, and air introduction means

at one end of the duct for fluidising the fine powder in
said duct.
Apparatus according to Claim 1, wherein
the heating means comprises a jacket encircling

the duct and capable of heating the duct to above
a temperature of 180°C.
Apparatus according to Claim 1 or Claim
2, wherein the duct is a substantially vertical

tube through which fine powder passes downwardly,
air being introduced at the base of the tube and

passing upwardly to fluidise the powder.
Apparatus according to Claim 3, wherein
the tube has a diameter in the range of 75-150 mm and

a height in the range of 4-5 metres. 
Apparatus according to any preceding
claim and including a hopper (16) at the outlet end of

said duct to collect hot powder.
Apparatus according to Claim 5, wherein
the hopper is insulated.
Apparatus according to Claim 5 or Claim 6
and further including a cooler (17) downstream of said

hopper.
Apparatus according to Claim 7, wherein
the cooler (17) comprises a substantially vertical tube

through which the powder passes from top to
bottom, and an external water jacket through which

coolant is passed in use.
Apparatus according to Claim 7 or Claim
8, wherein the sterilising tube and the cooling

tube are upright and arranged adjacent one
another, the hopper (16) being above the cooling tube (17)

and lift means (15) being provided to transfer powder
from the base of the sterilising tube to the

hopper.
A method of sterilising fine powders and
comprising the steps of: 


a) heating a sterilizing duct to a
temperature of approximately 500°C;
b) introducing fine powder at one end of the
duct and removing fine powder from the

other end of the duct with a powder residence
time in the duct sufficient to heat the

powder to above 120°C;
c) introducing air into the duct at a rate
of 30-60 litres per minute.
A method of sterilizing fine powders
according to Claim 10 and further including the

steps of:

d) permitting the fine powder to soak at an
elevated temperature for at least 15

minutes on exit from the sterilizing
duct; and
e) cooling the fine powder for discharge and
further processing.
