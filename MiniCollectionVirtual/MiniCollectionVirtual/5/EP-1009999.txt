<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and a device for identifying active substances in order to determine the formation of complexes between reactants. According to the inventive method, at least two reactants are mixed and made to react to form a complex. The infrared spectrum of the individual reactants with have not yet been reacted in the mixture is measured during a first time interval and at least a second infrared measurement is conducted to measure the complex formed by the reactants during a second interval. The difference between the two spectra measured during different moments is then determined. The reactants whose differential spectrum exhibits a band structure are selected as active substances. The invention further relates to a device, wherein two loop valves are filled with the reagent and the organic compound by means of two pumps, the loop vales are made to communicate to form a closed area, a mixture is produced with a third pump in the closed area and then fed to an infrared cuvette.

<CLAIMS>
Method of identifying active substances, wherein at least two
reactants, which form a complex, are mixed together, and the IR

spectrum of the individual reactants, which have not yet reacted in
the mixture, is detected at a first point in time, and the complex of

the reactants is determined with at least one additional IR spectrum
at a second point in time, a differential spectrum of two IR spectra,

which were detected at different points in time, is formed, and
those reactants, where the differential spectrum has a band

structure, are selected as the active substances.
Method according to claim 1, wherein the point in time
immediately after the mixing of the reactants is selected as the first

point in time.
Method according to claim 1 or 2, wherein at least one of the
reactants is a low-molecular compound.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 3, wherein at least one of
the reactants is a protein.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 4, wherein at least one of
the reactants is a DNS molecule.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 5, wherein a waiting time
in the region of between one millisecond and one day lies between

the first point in time and the second point in time. 
Method according to one of claims 1 to 6, wherein the method is
accomplished in succession or parallel with a plurality of reactants,

the reactants being displayed in a microtitre plate.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 7, wherein the
measurement of the IR spectra is effected at a layer thickness of 1

to 25 Âµm.
Apparatus for accomplishing the method according to claim 1,
wherein


a first sample loop valve (3) is fillable with a first reactant
by a first pump (6), and
a second sample loop valve (4) is fillable with at least one
second reactant by a second pump (7),
the sample loop valves (3, 4) are interconnectable in such a
manner that the first reactant and the second reactant can be

enclosed in a sealed chamber,
the first reactant and the second reactant can be mixed with
a third pump and conveyed from the sealed chamber into an

IR cell, and
means are provided for detecting IR spectra.
