<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid
crystal light valve apparatus which produces an optical
image by spatial modulation of light, and further to a
projection display apparatus using the liquid crystal
light valve apparatus.In a projection display apparatus for displaying
an optical image obtained by a "light valve" (spatial
modulation means of light) onto a screen through a
projection lens, a liquid crystal panel (hereinafter is
referred to as LC panel) is widely used for the light
valve. Such a display apparatus is disclosed in the
Japanese published unexamined patent applications Sho 63-73782
and Hei 3-71110, for example.In general, an LC panel of twisted nematic type
(hereinafter is referred to as TN type) is used for the
display apparatus of projection type. An example of the
display apparatus using the LC panel of the TN type in the
prior art is shown in FIG.1. Referring to FIG.1, a light
beam 301A emitted from a light source 301 is applied to
the LC panel 312 of the TN type, and an optical image of 
the LC panel 312 is projected on a screen 304 through an
optical lens 303.The LC panel 312 comprises a liquid crystal cell
302 (hereinafter is referred to as LC cell), an incident
side polarizing plate 305 and an outgoing side polarizing
plate 306. The LC cell 302 comprises two transparent
glass substrates 302A and liquid crystal 307 filled
between both glass substrates 302A. Transparent
electrodes for forming pixels and a plurality of thin film
transistors (hereinafter referred to as TFT) for
controlling the transparent electrodes are disposed on the
inner surfaces of the glass substrates 302A. The TFTs are
controlled by an image signal which is supplied from an
external device. The above-mentioned LC cell 302 is
called an active matrix type LC cell and the TFT serves as
a switching element.The liquid crystal 307 in the LC cell 302 turns
the phase of an incident light in compliance with an
electric field created between both the transparent
electrodes, and accordingly, an optical image is generated
in the LC cell 302. The LC panel 312 of the active matrix
type is adequate to the LC apparatus of projection type in
order to obtain a superior image quality. A color image
is realizable by attaching color filters to the pixels of
the LC cell 302.The LC panel 312 of the TN type may be driven by 
two display modes. One of two the display modes is called
a "normally black mode" (hereinafter is referred to as NB
mode). In the NB mode, the polarization axis of the
incident side polarizing plate 305
