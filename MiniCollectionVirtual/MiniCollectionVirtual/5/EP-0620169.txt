<ABSTRACT>
A conveyor chain assembly (10) including a multiplicity of rows 
of chain modules (12), each module includes a plurality of link 

ends (24) 
with coaxially aligned openings (30). A chain pin (46) passes through the 

coaxially aligned openings of adjacent modules. On the opposite 
ends of each module is a plug socket (54) which is adapted to house a 

plug (80). The plug includes a shaft (82) and an arm (96). The arm 
is moveable 

when the shaft is mounted in the socket between a first position 
in which the arm restricts axial movement of the chain pin and a 

second position in which the arm does not restrict axial movement 
of the chain pin.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a modular conveyor chain assembly of the
type as defined in the preamble of claim 1, a plug for use with that
chain assembly, and a module for use in that chain assembly.Some prior art conveyor chains are comprised of rows of
molded plastic chain modules pivotally joined together by chain
pins. Each module of such chains has a plurality of spaced lid
ends which intermesh with the complementary lid ends projecting
from a module in an adjacent row. Further, each link end has
therein a bore which is coaxially aligned with the bores of other
link ends to house the chain pin. In some arrangements, the
chain pin projects from each edge or side of the conveyor chain
and is provided with a head on one end of the chain pin to
restrict axial movement of the chain pin. The head can be
preformed but, in most cases, the head is formed by heat and
pressure after the chain pin has been placed in position in the
module. The head also projects from the side of the conveyor and
can catch or drag on adjacent structures thus requiring
additional lateral clearance between the conveyor and the
conveyor guide or between adjacent conveyor chains. To remove
the chain pin from an assembled chain, the head on one end of the 
chain pin has to be cut off. Once the head is severed, the chain
pin becomes unusable because its length is too short to form a
new head.Prior art conveyor chains
of the type as described in the preamble of claim 1
include plugs housed in the
opposite ends of the link end bores to restrict axial movement of
the chain pins
(EP-A-288 409, EP-A-459 691 or EP-A-503 333).
The plugs of such chains are normally small
parts that can be lost or dropped on the floor of a production
facility when they are inserted or removed from the modules. In
some prior art constructions, these plugs have a tendency to be
dislodged or pop out of the module when the conveyor chain is in
use. Without the plug restricting axial movement of chain pin,
the chain pins can become dislodged from their proper position
and cause a disruption in the conveyor assembly.The invention as claimed in claim 1 provides a conveyor chain assembly including
a multiplicity of rows of chain modules. Each module includes an
intermediate section, a plurality of link ends projecting
forwardly and rearwardly from the intermediate section with
respect to the direction of movement of the conveyor chain. The
link ends of each chain module intermesh with the link ends of
the chain module in the adjacent row. A chain pin passes through
align
