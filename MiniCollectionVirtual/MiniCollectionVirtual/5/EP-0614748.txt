<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a method for producing a thermoplastic resin sheet or 
film (3), 

wherein a raw resin material to which have been added one or more 
additives 

selected from the group consisting of a nucleating agent, fine powder 
of a high 

melting point polymer, a petroleum resin, a terpene resin and an organic 
peroxide is melted under heat to form a resin sheet or film, the 

resulting resin 
sheet or film is brought into contact with and adhered to the outer 

surface of 
a cooling roll (4) having a mirror-finished surface or the outer surface 

of an 
endless metal belt (5) having a mirror-finished surface and then moved 

along with 
the roll or the belt, and thereafter it is inserted, pressed and cooled 

between 
the outer surface of said cooling roll and the outer surface of said 

endless metal belt. 
Also disclosed is a method for producing a thermoplastic resin sheet 
or film, 

wherein a raw resin material to which have been added one or more 
additives 

selected from the group consisting of a nucleating agent, fine powder 
of a high 

melting point polymer, a petroleum resin, a terpene resin, an organic 
peroxide 

and a crystalline polypropylenic copolymer is melted under heat to form 
a resin 

sheet or film, the resulting resin sheet or film is inserted between a 
cooling 

roll (34) having a mirror-finished surface and an endless metal belt (35) 
having a 

mirror-finished surface, then it is moved and cooled while being kept 
in contact 

with the outer surface of said cooling roll between said cooling roll 
and said 

endless metal belt, and thereafter it is pressed from the inside of 
said endless 

metal belt, then it is released from the contact with said cooling 
roll, and it 

is further moved while being kept adhered to said endless metal belt 
and then 

peeled from the belt. The non-oriented sheet or film thus produced, 
having a 

high surface gloss, a high surface smoothness and a high transparency, is 
suitable for wrapping foods, medicines, etc.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for efficiently producing a
non-stretched, super-transparent sheet or film of a thermoplastic resin, which
is favorable to wrapping materials for foods and medicines, etc.Sheets or films made of crystalline thermoplastic resins, especially
polypropylene resins, have different physical properties such as transparency,
depending on the crystalline morphology thereof. Heretofore, the use of
polypropylene resins has been limited though the resins have excellent physical
properties such as heat resistance, moisture-proofness and oil resistance and
they are lightweight and are cause no environmental pollution. This is because
when the resins are shaped into sheets or further into containers from the
shaped sheets, the sheets and the containers have poor transparency.In order to make polypropylene resin sheets transparent, it is necessary
to make the both surfaces of the sheet glossy and additionally to make the
inside of the sheet transparent. To make the both surfaces of the sheet glossy,
for example, there are known a method of transferring a roll mirror face to
them, a method of transferring a metal mirror face to them using an endless
belt having the face, a method of increasing the surface gloss of a melt web
extruded from a die, etc. On the other hand, in order to make the inside of the
sheet transparent, for example, there are known (a) a method of inhibiting
crystallization of the sheet or letting the sheet have fine crystals (having a 
particle size smaller than the minimum wavelength of visible rays) by modifying
the raw materials, (b) a method of inhibiting crystallization of the sheet by
rapidly cooling it, (c) a method of breaking the crystals in the sheet by
stretching or orientation, etc.Accordingly, various methods comprised of these means as combined have
heretofore been proposed. For instance, there has been proposed a method of
transferring a roll mirror face to the surfaces of a resin sheet while a
nucleating agent is added to the raw resin, whereby the both surfaces of the
resin sheet are made glossy while the inside of the sheet is made transparent.
According to the method, however, it is difficult to form a thin sheet and the
transparency of the sheet formed is not complete.Apart from the above, another method has also been proposed, in which a
roll mirror face is transferred to the both surfaces of a resin sheet while the
sheet is rolled under pressure. According to the method, however, since the
sheet is stretched and oriented by rolling under
