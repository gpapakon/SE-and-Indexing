<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a soot filter device for diesel engines with a plurality of filter tubes 8 arranged parallel side by side with one another in a cylindrical chamber, through the walls of which filter tubes the exhaust gas passes from the outside inwards, it being possible to lead the exhaust gas through an inlet connection 2 into a prechamber 4 which is situated in front of the filter tubes and from which the exhaust gas flows to the filter tubes, and it being possible to burn off the layer of soot deposited on the outside of the filter tubes at intervals by means of hot air, which can be generated by a hot air device, the prechamber 4 having two cylindrical perforated plates 17, 18, arranged coaxially, which between them form an annular space 5, a second annular space 4, into which the inlet connection 2 opens, existing between the outer perforated plate 17 and the chamber inside wall.
