<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides an aqueous ink composition
for ball-point pens comprising a titanium oxide as a white

pigment, a viscosity modifier and flat-shaped resin particles.
The color of the aqueous ink composition can be adjusted by

coloring agents (such as a pigment). The viscosity of the
aqueous ink composition is 100 cps to 20,000 cps at 20 °C.

The average particle diameter of said flat-shaped resin
particles is 0.05 µm to 10 µm and the content thereof is 1 %

by weight to 35 % by weight with respect to the total amount
of the aqueous ink composition. The content of the titanium

oxide is 5 % by weight to 55 % by weight with respect to the
total amount of the aqueous ink composition. As a viscosity

modifier, a polysaccharide is used and the content thereof
is 0.1 % by weight to 2 % by weight with respect to the total

amount of the aqueous ink composition.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an aqueous ink composition
for ball-point pens. More specifically, the present invention
relates to the improvement of stability to dispersibility and
concealing power of an aqueous ink composition for ball-point
pens wherein a titanium oxide is contained as a white pigment.With regard to a conventional aqueous ink composition, for
example, an aqueous ink composition with high viscosity
comprising a coloring agent, water, a water-soluble organic
solvent, a viscosity modifier and spherical fine particles of
polymer has been disclosed in the Japanese Examined Patent
Publication No.5-46389. And an aqueous ink composition
comprising alkylene-bis-melamine derivatives as a white
pigment is disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication
No.8-48930.However, in case that a ball-point pen with an ink container
tube charged with a conventional aqueous ink composition with
high viscosity comprising, for example, the titanium oxide and
spherical fine particles of polymer is allowed to stand with 
its writing tip oriented downward for a long time (for storage,
and the like), the titanium oxide contained in the mentioned
aqueous ink composition precipitates and non-uniformity of the
density of the ink composition arises inside the ink container.
This non-uniformity of the density of the ink composition causes
clogging at the writing tip and then, the writing characteristic
deteriorates. Inside the ink container, the ink composition
separates into various layers (such as a layer including the
titanium oxide, a layer without the titanium oxide and the like).
Thus, with a ball-point pen comprising a transparent or
semitransparent ink container, the outward appearance
deteriorates.On the other hand, when the mentioned ball-point pen is
allowed to stand with its writing tip oriented upward for a
long time (for storage, and the like), the titanium oxide
contained in the mentioned aqueous ink composition
precipitates at the opposite end of the ink container to the
writing tip, so that the titanium oxide has difficulty in
flowing out during writing. As a result, its writing portion
has poor color development (particularly, that of white color
and the like) and the lowered concealing power.Conventional aqueous ink composition for-ball-point pens has
the above mentioned disadvantages. Therefore, when a
ball-point pen with such an aqueous ink composition (the
conventional aqueous ink composition comprising the titanium 
oxide and spherical fine particles of polymer) is displayed
at a shop
