<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a storage case for a disc-shaped information carrier substrate with a central hole, especially for an optically readable digital audio disc (CD) in which the case has a box-like container section and a supporting section inserted therein and substantially espousing the shape of the information carrier which has a central securing component transfixing the hole in the information carrier and has spring-loaded tongues as the locking component which engage by a radially outward-facing thickening over the inner edge of the hole in the information carrier. According to the invention, there are at least two raising components (16; 28) which engage beneath the edge of the information carrier in the region of the locking component and an actuating means (13; 21) for deliberately releasing the locking device and to act on the raising components (16; 28). Pressure on the actuating means releases the locking components and at the same time the information carrier is raised by the raising components, thus facilitating removal.

A storage case for a disc-shaped data carrier
having a cutout in the central region, in particular

for an optically readable digital audio disc, the case
having a box-shaped container part (1) and a bed part

(3) inserted therein and substantially matched to the
contour of the data carrier, which part is provided

with a contact surface (9) and with a central holding
element (8) which passes through the cutout in the data

carrier and which has resilient tongues (12) designed
as locking means, which each engage over the inner edge

of the cutout in the data carrier with a thickened
section (14) pointing radially outwards, with at least

two lifting elements (16; 28) being provided which
engage underneath the edge of the data carrier in the

region of the locking element, and with an actuating
means (13; 21) being provided for selectively releasing

the locking element, characterised in that at least
part of the resilient tongues (12) designed as locking

elements are each securely connected to a finger-like
lifting element (16; 28) extending radially outwards in

the plane of the contact surface (9) and to actuating
means (13; 21) directed radially inwards for acting on

the lifting elements (16; 28) and that in each case the
resilient tongue (12) connected to a lifting element

(16) is connected to the bed part (3) via resilient
crosspieces (17) which extend in the plane of the

contact surface (9).
A storage case according to Claim 1, characterised
in that the lifting element (16; 28) is provided on its

underside at a distance from the associated resilient
tongue with a supporting foot (18; 29) which lies on

the base (19) of the container part (1). 
A storage case according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that the free ends of the resilient

tongues (12) are each provided with extensions (13)
directed radially inwards to form a finger pressure

surface.
A storage case according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the actuating means is triggered

by a loosely inserted, positively held button (21).
