<ABSTRACT>
Efficient paving operation requires that the levelling 
operation of asphalt be carried out accurately along a reference 

line (A) which follows a given direction along a roadside. A simple 
and effective automatic control device for controlling the 

steering direction in conjunction with adjustments of the screed (6) 
for an asphalt finisher (1) (shortened to finisher) is presented. 

The control device automatically regulates the extension or 
contraction of the screeds (6) on both sides of the finisher (1) in 

reference to a visual display of the reference line (A) following 
some objects along the roadside. The visual detection system of 

control is simple and economical and provides an accurate 
control over the direction of paving.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device as contained in the preamble of
claim 1.A device of this type is know from the JP. Utility Model H3-34781.Automation is a key factor in efficient and economical road
construction, and much effort is expended in developing
automated control systems for various aspects of asphalt
finishers. For example, the inventors of the present invention
have previously disclosed an automatic directional control
device for use with an asphalt finisher (Japanese Patent
Application, Second Publication, H4-32883), and a device for
controlling the operation of screeds of an asphalt finisher
(Japanese Utility Model Application No. H3-34781).The automatic directional control device (H4-32883) was
designed to detect the travel direction of an asphalt finisher
(referred to as the finisher herein below) in accordance with
the signals emitted from three light sensors which are arranged
laterally on the front section of a finisher body to detect a
reference line disposed on a roadside.The screed is a device for levelling the asphalt within a
defined region of the road so as to align appropriately to the
edges of the road, and is disposed on the side sections of the 
finisher. The screeds are required to be extended or retracted
depending on the position of the finisher with respect to the
reference line. In a conventional finisher, this operation is
performed manually by a finisher operator who controls fluid
pressure in a plurality of hydraulic cylinders so as to move the
cylinders to left or right in accordance with his visual
confirmation of the reference line and instructions from a
screed manager. The screed manager is responsible for the
quality of the paved road, and he may be required to travel from
side to side to check the direction of the travel or he may
choose to assign the task of monitoring the road width to a
couple of sidemen to watch the edges of the laid down asphalt,
so that he may concentrate on the duty of maintaining the paving
quality. Such working conditions are generally not satisfactory
and ultimately resulted in manual adjustments of the road width,
and other such labor-intensive corrective measures.An improvement in the conventional approach was achieved in
the above-noted invention (H3-34781), by providing a detector,
such as a CCD camera to detect the reference line, so as to
control the extension or retraction of the screed by a screed
controller.This screed controller described above presented the
following problem, however. When the detector is disposed at
the
