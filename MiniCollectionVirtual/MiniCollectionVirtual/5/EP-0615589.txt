<ABSTRACT>
The invention pertains to a control device of a hydrostatic transmission with a hydraulic pump (1), an adjustable hydraulic motor (2) and a brake valve (5) in two working lines (15, 16) connected to the hydraulic motor and the hydraulic pump, which brake valve closes one of the working lines when the transmission is in override, with a regulating device (8) working from a control pressure taken from the working lines between hydraulic motor and brake valve and used to adjust the displacement volume of the hydraulic motor, and with a control valve (9) for regulating the control pressure admission depending on a control signal. While maximum braking torque is maintained, the braking action of the hydrostatic transmission is improved in that the control signal is proportionate to the speed of the hydraulic motor and, as this speed increases, controls the pressure control admission, via the control value (9), toward minimal displacement volume of the hydraulic motor (2), and in that when a predetermined pressure difference appears in the working line segments (15, 19; 16, 22 and 15, 20) between hydraulic pump (1) and brake valve (5) as well as brake valve (5) and hydraulic motor (2), with a higher pressure in the latter working line segments (15, 20; 16, 23), an override valve (11) overrides the control valve (9) by controlling the control pressure admission toward maximum displacement volume of the hydraulic motor.

comprises at least one hydraulic pump (1), at least one 

adjustable hydraulic motor (2) and a brake valve (5) which 
is arranged in two operating lines (15, 16) connected to 

the hydraulic motor, of which lines at least one leads to 
the hydraulic pump, and which, upon overrun operation of 

the hydrostatic transmission, in each case at least 
partially closes one of the operating lines,
