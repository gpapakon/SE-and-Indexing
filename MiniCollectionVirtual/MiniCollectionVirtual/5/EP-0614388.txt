<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Patent Application
Serial No. 07/740,004, filed August 2, 1991, entitled "Two Dimensional
Scanner-Amplifier Laser", corresponding to the intermediate document
WO93/03521.This invention relates to a pulsed laser apparatus,
and more particularly to a laser-based
apparatus for corneal surgery.The concept of correcting refractive errors by changing the
curvature of the eye was brought forth early on, as illustrated in the
notable mechanical methods pioneered by J. Barraquer. These
mechanical procedures involve removal of a thin layer of tissue from
the cornea by a micro-keratome, freezing the tissue at the
temperature of liquid nitrogen, and re-shaping the tissue in a
specially designed lathe. The thin layer of tissue is then re-attached
to the eye by suture. The drawback of these methods is the lack of
reproducibility and hence a poor predictability of surgical results. With the advent of lasers, various methods for the correction of
refractive errors have been attempted, making use of the coherent
radiation properties of lasers, and the precision of the laser-tissue
interaction. A CO2 laser was one of the first to be applied in this
field. Peyman, et al., in Ophthalmic Surgery, vol. 11, pp. 325-9,
1980, reported laser burns of various intensity, location, and
pattern were produced on rabbit corneas. Recently, Horn, et al., in
the Journal of Cataract Refractive Surgery, vol. 16, pp. 611-6,
1990, reported that a curvature change in rabbit corneas had been
achieved with a Co:MgF2 laser by applying specific treatment
patterns and laser parameters. The ability to produce burns on the
cornea by either a CO2 laser or a Co:MgF2 laser relies on the
absorption in the tissue of the thermal energy emitted by the laser.
Histologic studies of the tissue adjacent to burn sites caused by a
CO2 laser reveal extensive damage characterized by a denaturalized
zone of 5-10 microns deep and disorganized tissue region extending
over 50 microns deep. Such lasers are thus ill-suited to corneal
laser surgery.In U.S. Patent No. 4,784,135, Blum et al. discloses the use of far-ultraviolet
radiation of wavelengths less than 200 nm to selectively
remove biological materials. The removal process is claimed to be
by photoetching without requiring heat as the etching mechanism.
Medical and dental applications for the removal of damaged or
unhealthy tissue from bone, removal of skin lesions, and the
treatment of decayed teeth are cited. No specific use for cornea
surgery is suggested, and
