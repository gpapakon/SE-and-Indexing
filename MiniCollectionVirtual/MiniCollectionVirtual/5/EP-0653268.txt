<ABSTRACT>
A buffer/brake system (12) is provided for carriers (11) used in an 
automated assembly system. The rear ends (17) of the carriers are 

equipped with a flexible ring (28) that is compressed when the queued 
carrier is struck by an oncoming carrier. Compression of the 

flexible ring engages the sidewalls (36,37) of the track support (27) that 
accommodates the conveyor (25) and the frictional engagement of the 

ring against the sidewalls of the track support act as a brake 
for the queued carrier. The ring also acts to absorb the shock 

resulting from the collision between the queued carrier and the 
oncoming carrier. The buffer/brake system is fully incorporated 

in and fixedly attached to the carrier and is not placed on the 
conveyor separately.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to
carriers and combinations of carriers and
conveyor systems for use
in manufacture operations such as automated assembly systems or
machine tool loading operations
and a method of conveying in such systems.
A specific application of this
invention relates to conveyor systems for use in synchronous or
non-synchronous assembly systems. Improved carriers are provided
with bumper/braking capabilities to reduce shock transmitted when
one moving or oncoming carrier slams into a stationary or queued
carrier located downstream from the oncoming carrier on the
moving conveyor. For ease of description, the invention will be
described in the context of automated assembly operations.Automated conveyor systems for the assembly of products are
well-known. Automated conveyor systems can be divided into two
principal categories: synchronous and non-synchronous. The
present invention is directed to non-synchronous assembly systems
and specifically to the problem encountered when a moving carrier
slams into or otherwise is stopped by a stationary or queued
carrier located downstream from the moving carrier. The present
invention is directed to an improved system that buffers the
collision between two carriers thereby reducing shock transmitted
to the products disposed on top of the carriers. The present
invention further provides a means for preventing forward
movement of a queued carrier and eliminating or drastically
reducing shock transmission to the queued carrier as it is struck 
from behind by an oncoming carrier. The present invention may
also provide a means for stopping an oncoming carrier as it
engages a queued carrier.Workpieces are transported from stage to stage in an
assembly system by carriers or carrier assemblies which ride on
top of the conveyor or conveyor chain. In a synchronous assembly
system, a workpiece and carrier proceed through each stage of the
assembly process and do not proceed to the next stage until the
remaining workpieces are also ready to proceed to the next stage
(i.e., each workpiece is in synch with the other workpieces).
Thus, in synchronous assembly systems, the conveyor stops after
each workpiece arrives at its respective processing stage and the
stage or task that takes the greatest amount of time will limit
the rate at which all other tasks or stages can be completed
because the conveyor will not resume a forward motion until all
the workpieces, including the workpiece at the slowest stage, are
ready to proceed to the next stage.In contrast, in
