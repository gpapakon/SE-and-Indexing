<ABSTRACT>
A shaft clutch mechanism, and method and apparatus for its production are disclosed. The shaft clutch mechanism has an upper body (32) folded into a polygonal cross section with a plurality of fingers (34), each finger attached to and extending from a flat section of the upper body. The shaft clutch mechanism is pressed on to one end of an inner nested element of a telescoping body and is placed inside an outer element where the fingers are slightly deformed, providing slight friction sufficient to hold the inner element in place, but still allowing it to slide relative to the outer element. The method and apparatus for producing the shaft clutch mechanism use a two stage press and a bending device to take a continuous strip of material to form blanks which then are bent to form the shaft clutch mechanism that is pressed on to the inner element of the telescoping body.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for manufacturing a
shaft clutch mechanism and apparatus for its production. More
particularly, both the method and apparatus for its production
relate to a clutch which allows relative movement between two
elements in a telescoping body where one element is nested inside
the second element and adjustment to relative position is
required, and yet the mechanism holds the two elements stationary
relative to each other after the desired adjustment is made.The document DE-A-2 029 896 discloses an apparatus for bending a
metal strip, especially for the production of a straddling sleeve
with a plurality of resilient fingers and a polygonal upper
portion. The fingers have a slight convex bow. The apparatus
comprises a bending tool with bending jaws which are adapted to a
mandrel where about the metal strip is bent to gain the polygonal
configuration.The use of telescoping bodies which have nested elements to make an object
more compact is well known, and has been practiced for a long time. One of the
problems presented by any sort of telescoping body using nested elements is in
controlling movement of the elements relative to one another. This can be a
particularly vexing problem when the telescoping body is load-bearing, such as the
support member for a music stand.In a music stand there is typically a support member comprised of an outer
tube, and an inner tube which is slidably mounted within the outer tube. This
support member is vertically oriented, with the music holder mounted on top of the
upper end of the inner tube. The weight of the music holder and any music placed
on the music holder presents a problem, given the telescopic nature of the music
stand. It is important that the height of the music stand be easily adjustable, but
it is equally important that the adjustment be retained and that the inner tube of 
the music stand remain stationary relative to the outer tube of the music stand
when adjustments are completed and the stand is in use.Attempts to achieve the desired adjustment with music stands is illustrative
of attempts to achieve adjustments with telescoping bodies in general. The simplest
and most straight forward way of achieving this adjustment is to crimp the upper
end of the outer tube against the inner tube body, using the friction from the outer
tube upper end to hold the inner tube stationary, while allowing it to be adjustable.
This method has a number of limitations, including the fact that it requires a very
precise fit with the inner
