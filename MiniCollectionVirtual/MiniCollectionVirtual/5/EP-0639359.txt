<ABSTRACT>
An endoprothesis for a shoulder joint, comprising a head 
portion (10) including a spherical joint surface (16) and an elongate 

shank portion (12) which is to be driven into the proximal 
humerus and which is to be connected to said head portion (10), 

wherein the head portion (10) includes a first threaded portion (18) 
cooperating with a second threaded portion (34) provided at the 

proximal ending of the shank portion (12) such that the distance 
between the head portion (10) and the shank portion (12) is 

adjustable.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an endoprosthesis for a shoulder joint as defined by claim 1.An endoprosthesis of this type usually includes a tapered plug-in connection between
a head portion including a spherical joint surface and the elongate shank portion.
The axis of the plug-in connection coincides with the axis of the shank and the
center of curvature of the joint surface is spaced from said axis.For this structure the distance between the joint surface or, respectively, the center of
curvature thereof and the shank portion depends on the shape of the head portion
and cannot be varied any more after the head portion has been manufactured. In particular,
the lateral distance of the humerus from the joint cannot be adjusted.US-A-3 102 536 discloses an endoprosthesis for a hip joint
which endoprosthesis comprises an elongate shank portion having a distal and a
proximal portion, the proximal portion having an end portion which is inclined with
respect to the axis of the shank portion, the endoprosthesis further comprising a
separate head portion having a spherical joint surface. 
The neck portion of the
shank portion or stem is cylindrical and adapted to be accommodated by a blind bore
or a ball head. The wall of the blind bore has peripherally spaced grooves extending
parallel to the axis of the bore and having different lengths. A radially extending pin
on the neck portion is adapted to engage one of the grooves in order to vary the
position of the ball head on the neck portion. The ball head is fastened to the neck
portion by a screw extending through a hole coaxial to the blind bore of the ball
portion and adapted to be threaded into a threaded bore at the proximal end of the
neck portion. In another embodiment of the known hip joint, the neck portion has an
outer thread to be threaded into the threaded blind bore of the ball head. It is an object of the present invention to provide an endoprosthesis for a shoulder
joint that provides for an adjustable distance between the head portion and the shank
portion.According to the invention the head portion of the endoprosthesis is connected to the
proximal end of the shank portion through a threaded connection such that the
distance between the head portion and the shank portion can be varied. The head
portion is screwed into the shank portion until the desired distance is obtained.The threaded portion is formed as a threaded pin having an outer thread and the
second threaded portion is formed by a threaded blind bore. On the one side this
facilitates

<CLAIMS>
An endoprosthesis for a shoulder joint, comprising an elongate shank portion (12)
adapted to be driven into the proximal humerus and having a distal portion (52) and a

proximal portion (48), the proximal portion (48) having an end portion (32) which is
inclined with respect to the axis of the shank portion (12) and having a blind bore (34,

34')
and being provided with an internal thread (36), a separate head portion (10) having a

spherical joint surface (16) and a pin portion (18) opposite to the joint surface (16),
