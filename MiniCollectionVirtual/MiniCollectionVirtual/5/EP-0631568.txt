<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for preparation of chloroprene 
monomer in which quaternary ammonium phase transfer catalyst is 
removed from the crude product by treatment with an oxy acid. Chloroprene (2-chlorobutadiene-1,3) is an important 
monomer used in the manufacture of a number of synthetic elastomers. It is 
normally prepared by dehydrochlorination of 3,4-dichlorobutene-1 ("DCB") 
with aqueous alkali, for example sodium hydroxide. U.S. Patent 3,981,937, 
Campbell et al., discloses a catalytic process for carrying out the 
dehydrochlorination in the presence of a quaternary ammonium salt 
catalyst. In one variant of the Campbell et al. process, DCB, aqueous 
alkali, and the catalyst are introduced into one or more agitated reaction 
vessels and allowed to react at moderately elevated temperature (e.g. 50°. 
70°C) until the DCB is substantially completely dehydrochlorinated. The 
reactor effluent contains the chloroprene product, excess aqueous alkali, 
brine formed in the process, the catalyst and various organic byproducts. 
Chloroprene is recovered from the effluent by steam-stripping. U.S. Patent 4,605,800 discloses an improvement in the process 
for manufacture of chloroprene. The effluent from the dehydrochlorination 
reactor is separated into phases, and the organic phase is steam-stripped at 
low temperature (below about 80°C) to recover chloroprene product, while 
the steam stripper heels (containing the catalyst) are returned to the 
dehydrochlorination reactor. The organic phase may be treated with an acid 
such as, for example, acetic acid or sulfuric acid, to neutralize residual alkali 
prior to the steam stripping step. Although the use of quaternary ammonium salt catalysts 
results in the attainment of high yields in the above-described 
dehydrochlorination processes, the use of these compounds is associated 
with certain disadvantages. For example, the presence of the catalyst causes  
 
corrosion of equipment used in recovery of chloroprene from the organic 
phase. In addition, the presence of catalyst in the organic phase results in 
entrainment of water and brine in that phase due to the surfactant 
properties of the catalyst. The present invention provides a method for removal of 
catalyst from the dehydrochlorination product, thereby minimizing problems 
of entrainment and corrosion and permitting more efficient recycle of the 
relatively expensive catalyst. Accordingly, the invention provides a process 
for manufacturing chloroprene, comprising the steps of
