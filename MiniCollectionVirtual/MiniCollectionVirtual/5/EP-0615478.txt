<ABSTRACT>
A device for linking two tool parts has a projecting shaft (12) on the first tool part (10), as well as an annular surface (20) that surrounds the shaft (12) at its root, and a projecting coupling sleeve (16) on the second tool part (14) that has a cavity (18) for receiving the shaft (12) and a front face (22) that can be pressed against the annular surface (20) during clamping. In order to achieve, besides end face clamping, also a self-centering radial clamping of the shaft (12) within the coupling sleeve (16), the shaft (12) has a cavity (24) axially open towards the front face end of the shaft and a clamping body (28) axially movable within the cavity (24). The clamping body (20) is loosely screwed with an outer thread (72) in an inner thread (70) of the hollow shaft and secured against rotation. The wall (38) of the cavity is sized so that it can elastically bulge or expand in the radial direction over the slanted flanks (26, 30) of the thread and be pressed against the inner side of the coupling sleeve (16) when the clamping body (28) is pressed in the axial direction.
