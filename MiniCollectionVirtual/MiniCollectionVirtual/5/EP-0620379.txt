<ABSTRACT>
Torsional vibration damper in which a first inertia ring (5) is arranged at least partially radially to the outside of an inner ring 1 and is bonded to the latter by an intermediate ring (3) made of rubber, the intermediate ring (3) resting axially against the inertia ring (5) without clearance spaces and adhesion, the inertia ring (5) being bonded to the intermediate ring (3) essentially only in the region of its inside diameter, and a belt contact ring (4) which surrounds the inertia ring (5) radially on the outside, at least over a partial area, additionally being bonded to the intermediate ring (3).

A torsional vibration damper in which a first 
inertia ring (5) is arranged at least in part radially to 

the outside of an inner ring and is adhesively bonded to the 
latter by means of an intermediate ring (3) made of rubber, 

characterized in that the intermediate ring (3) touches the 
inertia ring (5), resting against it axially in a manner 

which avoids free spaces and sticking, in that the inertia 
ring (5) is adhesively bonded to the intermediate ring (3) 

essentially only in the region of its inside diameter, and 
in that the intermediate ring (3) additionally has 

adhesively bonded to it a belt contact ring (4) which 
surrounds the inertia ring (5) radially to the outside, at 

least in a partial area. 
A torsional vibration damper according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the intermediate ring (3) touches a 

second inertia ring (12), resting against it in a manner 
which substantially avoids free spaces and sticking, at the 

end remote in the axial direction from the first inertia 
ring (5), and in that the second inertia ring (12) is 

adhesively bonded to the intermediate ring (3) essentially 
only in the region of its inside diameter. 
A torsional vibration damper according to claim 3, 
characterized in that the second inertia ring (12) has a 

different inertial mass from the first inertia ring (5). 
A torsional vibration damper according to either 
of claims 2 and 3, characterized in that the adhesively 

bound zones of the first and of the second inertia ring (5, 
12) bound annular projections (13, 14) of the intermediate 

ring (3) which differ in their length L and/or width B. 
A torsional vibration damper according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the inner ring (1) is provided at the 

end remote in the axial direction from the inertia ring (5) 
with a supporting collar (7) which projects outwards 

radially and touches the intermediate ring (3), resting 
loosely against it in a manner which essentially avoids free 

spaces and sticking.  
 
A torsional vibration damper according to any of 
claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the intermediate ring 

(3) fills the radial interspace between the inner ring (1) 
and the belt contact ring (4) essentially completely. 
A torsional vibration damper according to claim 6, 
characterized in that the intermediate ring (3) has a 

profile which has a progressively shorter length in the 
axial direction towards the central region of its radial 

extent. 
A torsional vibration damper according to any of 
claims 1 to 7, characterized in that those areas in which 

the intermediate ring (3) touches the inertia rings (5, 12) 
and/or the supporting collar (7) and rests against them/it 

in a manner which avoids sticking can be wetted by a 
lubricant. 
A torsional vibration damper according to claim 8, 
characterized in that the supporting collar (7) and/or the 

inertia rings (5, 12) are penetrated by a lubrication 
opening. 
A torsional vibration damper according to any of 
claims 1 to 9, characterized in that the belt contact ring 

(4) is separated from an inertia ring (5, 12) and/or the 
supporting collar by a rubber layer of film-like 

configuration which forms an integral part of the 
intermediate ring (3). 
A torsional vibration damper according to any of claims 
1 to 11, characterized in that the belt contact ring is 

provided approximately in the central region of its axial 
extent with a guide ring (15) which projects radially 

inwards and has an inside diameter which is smaller than the 
outside diameter of each inertia ring (5, 12) and/or the 

supporting collar (7).
