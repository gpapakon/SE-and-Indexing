<ABSTRACT>
Particles of water soluble polymers such as poly(olefin oxides) are formulated to readily dissolve without agglomerating by associating polymer particles with particles of gas producing compounds, suitably a bicarbonate and an acid salt, which are non-reactive to the polymer but produce gas when wetted with water whereby the generated gas maintains polymer particles in separation as the particles dissolve.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHODS FOR DISSOLVING WATER SOLUBLE POLYMERS AND COMPOSITIONS USING SAMETechnical FieldThis invention relates to methods for formulating polymers in a manner which allows them to dissolve rapidly when mixed with water and to compositions employing those polymers.Specific embodiments of this invention include polymer formulations which dissolve rapidly without agglomeration and clumping when added to water and to compositions employing those formulations to obtain solutions of the polymer and materials associated therewith. Background ArtA host of water soluble polymers, both synthetic and naturally occurring, have found extensive use in a variety of fields. Illustrative synthetic polymers include olefin oxide polymers such as poly(ethylene oxide) and copolymers of ethylene oxide with other lower olefin oxides such as propylene oxide, butylene oxide and the like, water soluble vinyl addition polymers such as the various acrylamide polymers, polyvinyl alcohol and many others. Naturally occurring water soluble polymers include a wide variety of plant-derived gums, resins, polysaccarides and the like.Solutions of the polymers typically exhibit flocculating and thickening properties. Illustrative industrial applications include use as a flocculating agent in the clarification of aqueous solutions and suspensions as, for example, sewage and industrial wastes and in the secondary recovery of petroleum through water flooding. Certain of the high molecular weigh polymers, particularly high molecular weight poly(ethylene oxide) , can reduce the turbulent frictional drag of water flowing through a conduit by as much as 80% at concentrations of a few parts per million. That effect is especially useful in fire fighting and similar applications wherein it is desired to deliver a large volume of water through a restricted 

conduit at a high rate.It can be quite difficult to obtain a uniform water solution of many of the highly soluble polymers, particularly if the particles of the polymer are very small. As the polymer particles start to dissolve, a very concentrated and sticky solution forms around each particle. Contact of the partially dissolved particles, one with another, forms aggregates and lumps of polymer which resist dissolution. In almost all cases the simple addition of polymer particles to water, with or without stirring, results in agglomeration of the polymer particles into clumps which are then very difficult to dissolve.A number of different approaches and techniques for dissolving water soluble

1. A water soluble polymer formulated to rapidly dissolve in water without agglomeration characterized in that particles of the water soluble polymer are arranged in intimate association with particles of at least two other compounds, one of said compounds being a basic salt and another of said compounds being an acid salt, said compounds being non-reactive toward said polymer and non- reactive toward each other when dry but reacting to produce a gas when wetted with water.
