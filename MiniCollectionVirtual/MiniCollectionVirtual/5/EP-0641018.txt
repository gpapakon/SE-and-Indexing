<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor device, e.g. a TFT, is made by recrystallizing a 
thin silicon film (4) the thickness of which is comprised between 

50 Å and 250 Å, deposited on a light fermeable substrate (1). The 
recrystallizing step is a excimer laser one.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a manufacturing method 
of semiconductor device for forming a thin film transistor 
(TFT) on a light permeable substrate, and a TFT fabricated 
by the same manufacturing method. In a TFT using a polycrystalline silicon as 
semiconductor layer, the polycrystalline silicon is formed 
by a method of depositing a polycrystalline silicon thin 
film directly on a substrate made of quartz or the like at a 
temperature of 600°C or more by LPCVD (low-pressure chemical 
vapor deposition) method or the like, a method of forming a 
polycrystalline silicon by solid phase growth of 
hydrogenated amorphous silicon thin film, fine crystalline 
silicon thin film or the like at a temperature of 600°C or 
more, and a method of forming a polycrystalline thin film by 
fusing and polycrystallizing hydrogenated amorphous silicon 
thin film, fine crystalline silicon thin film or the like by 
laser light or other energy source, among others.  However, when the polycrystalline silicon TFT is 
fabricated by the conventional method of depositing the 
polycrystalline thin film directly on the substrate or the 
method of forming the polycrystalline silicon thin film by 
solid phase growth of hydrogenated amorphous silicon thin 
film or the like, the substrate must be heated at least 600 
°C more, and hence the substrate to be used in the TFT is 
limited. Or, in the forming method of polycrystalline silicon 
thin film by fusing and polycrystallizing with laser light 
or other energy source, it is important to keep uniformity 
of crystalline property and thin film, and fabrication of 
TFT showing stable characteristic was difficult. The invention is intended to offer a manufacturing 
method which can make transistor characteristics stable ,of 
the TFT using polycrystalline silicon thin film which is 
formed by irradiating a excimer laser on the hydrogenated 
amorphous silicon thin film . In the present invention the thickness of the 
hydrogenated amorphous silicon thin film to be fused and 
crystallined is 500 Å - 1250 Å . Here when the thickness is 
less than 500 Å, the irradiated laser energy largely affects 
the layer under the hydrogenated amorphous silicon thin film  
 
and when the thickness is more than 1250 Å, the irradiated 
laser energy does not reach the lowest part of the 
hydrogenated amorphous silicon thin film to make the 
characteristics of the lower part of the thin film and that 
of the upper part different each other. Then by make the 
thickness of the hydrogenated amorphous silicon
