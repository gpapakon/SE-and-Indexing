<ABSTRACT>
A method of manufacturing a hydraulic actuator body (10) such as, for example, a brake wheel cylinder or a clutch or brake master cylinder. The method includes the steps of forming a basic actuator body (10) having at least one spigot (14) projecting externally therefrom, holding the body (10) by gripping the spigot (14) between co-operating jaws and machining the body (10) whilst it is held by the spigot (14). If desired the spigot (14) can be removed from the body (10) when all other machining is complete.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of manufacturing 
hydraulic actuators such as brake and clutch master and slave 
cylinders. Internal shoe drum brakes of motor vehicles are typically 
operated by hydraulic wheel cylinders which are mounted on a 
backplate. Even though a particular size wheel cylinder may 
be fitted to a number of different vehicles, it is not 
unknown for different vehicle manufacturers to require 
different mounting flanges on their wheel cylinders and even 
for single vehicle manufacturers to have differing mounting 
flange requirements from vehicle to vehicle. Wheel cylinder bodies are generally produced as basic 
castings which are then machined to provide the final wheel 
cylinder body shape. Because of the differing requirements, 
particularly with reference to the mounting flange, the basic 
castings have different shapes and therefore require 
different jigs for holding the castings during the machining 
processes. Also different jigs may be required for different 
machining processes. Thus the manufacture of a range of wheel 
cylinders for a large number of different vehicles will 
require the use of a large number of different jigs.  
 This is both expensive and complicated to administer since 
each jig and casting must arrive at the particular machining 
process station as matched pairs. The same production problems also apply to other hydraulic 
actuators such as clutch and brake master cylinder. It is an object of the present invention to provide a method 
of manufacturing an hydrawlic actuator body whcih mitigates 
the above described production problems. Thus according to the present invention ther is provided a 
method manufacturing an hydraulic actuator body 
characterised by comprising the steps of: 
a) providing a casting mould for a basic actuator 
body, the mould defining a gripping 
spigot projecting from the body; b) casting the basic actuator body in the mould:  c) removing the body from the mould;  d) gripping the body in a machining jig using 
co-operative jaws which grip the spigot, 
and  e) machining the body whilst gripped in the jig.  The invention further provides a basic actuator body for use 
in the above described method, said body being characterised 
in that the body is cast with at least one gripping spigot 
projecting therefrom whereby the body can be subsequently 
gripped in a machining jig during a machining operation. There is also provided a wheel cylinder for a vehicle drum 
brake and a master cylinder manufactured by the above 
described

body (10), the mould defining a gripping spigot 

(14) projecting from the body; 
b) casting the basic actuator body in the mould: 
c) removing the body from the mould; 
d) gripping the body in a machining jig using 
co-operative jaws (21, 22) which grip the spigot, 

and 
e) machining the body whilst gripped in the jig.
