<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is a method and apparatus to 
control a pointing trajectory of an aim point with respect 

to one or more targets for a momentum bias spacecraft in an 
orbit inclined relative to an equatorial geosynchronous 

orbit wherein the spacecraft is provided with an onboard 
computer capable of using orbit information available to the 

spacecraft and spacecraft hardware to move the aim point 
according to a predetermined tracking model which may be 

either time-varying or invariant. The tracking model allows 
the controller 
to remove short-term nutational and long-term 
orbit rate dynamical disturbances, beyond simple-order 

sinusoidal functions having a single frequency.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus 
for attitude control of a spacecraft in orbit. It is known 
to provide attitude control for spacecraft in a 
geosynchronous equatorial plane orbit to correct for roll 
and yaw errors. For communication satellites, maintenance 
of a geosynchronous equatorial orbit greatly simplifies 
attitude control to obtain necessary pointing accuracy for 
the spacecraft. Maintenance of this equatorial orbit necessarily 
expends considerable propellant as spacecraft in equatorial 
orbit are subject to various destabilizing forces. These 
destabilizing forces include gravitational effects from the 
sun and moon which alter orientation of the geosynchronous 
orbit from an equatorial orbit with zero inclination, to a 
slightly inclined orbit. Stationkeeping is a function 
implemented by the spacecraft to maintain the spacecraft at 
a particular inclination. As more stationkeeping maneuvers 
are required, more propellant is used by the spacecraft, 
resulting in a determinable cost per operational lifetime. 
As an amount of propellant is increased to provide for 
extended stationkeeping, this cost necessarily increases. 
There is a well-recognized trade-off between the amount of 
propellant needed to fulfil stationkeeping maneuvering over 
the lifetime of the spacecraft versus its operational life. 
As more propellant is needed, the more cost is associated 
with putting the spacecraft into orbit. Similarly, as 
operational lifetime of the spacecraft is increased, 
additional propellant is required which again adds to the  
 
spacecraft's cost. It is therefore a desire associated with 
existing spacecraft to extend operational life without 
significantly increasing cost. One solution is to operate the spacecraft in its 
geosynchronous equatorial orbit until propellant is 
substantially exhausted. Thereafter, the spacecraft enters 
into an inclined orbit due to the disturbance forces. 
Generally drift of the inclination of the spacecraft's orbit 
is at a rate of about 0.8 degrees to about 0.9 degrees 
annually. Unfortunately, as inclination of the spacecraft 
increases, maintenance of a particular desired pointing 
accuracy becomes increasingly more difficult. This 
difficulty in maintaining a desired pointing accuracy is 
further increased by the lack of propellant which 
necessitated operation of the spacecraft in the inclined 
orbit. It is known that at a particular inclination, 
roll, pitch and yaw errors in spacecraft pointing are 
introduced. In an equatorial orbit, the
