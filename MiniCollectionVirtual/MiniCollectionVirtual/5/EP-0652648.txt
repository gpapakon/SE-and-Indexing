<ABSTRACT>
In a transmitting and receiving apparatus 
(31) for transmission and reception of signals based on 

the frequency hopping spread spectrum scheme, hopping 
patterns used for a transmitter and a receiver are 

respectively constructed of frequencies which belong to 
the same frequency band and which are selected such 

that frequencies of both hopping patterns do not overlap 
with each other at the same instant and besides, 

there are provided a level detecting circuit (42) for 
detecting a received power level of a received signal 

at each hopping frequency and a level control circuit 
(51) for performing transmission power control for each 

hopping frequency by using information detected by the 
level detecting circuit (42).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a
transceiver apparatus based on the frequency
hopping spread spectrum scheme and used for mobile communication
in, for example, digital car telephones and
portable telephones and more particularly, to this type
of apparatus which is constructed so as to easily practice
transmission power control aiming at countermeasures
against fading.In the frequency hopping spread spectrum
scheme, a frequency of a carrier used for modulation of
a digital signal is changed with time. In consequence,
the frequency can be averted from staying at a value
which degrades the communication condition and the
quality of communication can be uniformed.As shown in Figs. 1A and 1B, a conventional
transmitting and receiving apparatus based on the
frequency hopping spread spectrum scheme comprises a
transmitter 1 including a coder 3 for coding transmission
data 2, a modulator 4 for modulating a coded
signal to a first intermediate frequency signal 5, a
first frequency synthesizer 6 for performing the frequency
conversion of the first intermediate frequency 
signal 5 into an RF (radio frequency) signal 9, a first
frequency control circuit 7 for controlling a carrier
frequency used for the frequency conversion by the
first frequency synthesizer 6, a first band-pass filter
(BPF) 10 for cutting surplus signals, and an antenna 11
for transmission and reception of an electric wave.The apparatus comprises a receiver 12 including
a second BPF 13 for cutting surplus signals
from a received signal, a synchronous circuit 15 for
setting up synchronization on the basis of a received
signal 14, a second frequency synthesizer 18 for converting
the RF received signal 14 into a second intermediate
frequency signal 19 by multiplying the received
signal 14 by a carrier frequency, a second frequency
control circuit 16 for switching the carrier frequency
used for the frequency conversion by the second frequency
synthesizer 18 in accordance with the same
pattern as that in the transmitter, a demodulator 20
for demodulating the second intermediate frequency
signal 19, and a decoder 21 for performing decoding to
original data.As exemplified in Fig. 2, the first frequency
control circuit 7 of the transmitter 1 sequentially
switches the carrier frequency in the first frequency
synthesizer 6 to frequencies f1, f2, f3 and f4 each
time that a constant time has elapsed. This frequency
changing pattern (frequency hopping pattern) is predetermined.
The minimum unit of the frequency hopping 
pattern (defining the time for which
