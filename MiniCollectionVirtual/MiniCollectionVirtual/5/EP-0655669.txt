<ABSTRACT>
A circuit for generating a stable reference voltage (Vref) 
as temperature and process parameters vary, comprising at 

least one field-effect transistor (M1) and an associated 
resistive bias element (R) connected in series between a 

supply voltage (Vcc) and ground (GND), further comprises a 
second field-effect transistor (M2) connected to the first 

transistor such that the reference voltage (Vref) can be 
picked up as the difference between the respective 

threshold voltages of the two transistors. This provides a 
reference voltage which is uniquely stable against 

variations in temperature and process parameters.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a circuit for generating a stable
reference voltage.In particular, the invention relates to a circuit capable
of providing a reference voltage which is compensated for
temperature and process parameters, and is highly stable
with respect to the value of a supply voltage.As is known, many types of electronic circuits require a
reference voltage Vref which be stable over time.Several solutions have been proposed to derive, for
example, such a reference voltage Vref from the supply
voltage Vcc to the electronic circuit.The simplest way of achieving this is, for example, to
provide a resistive partition of the supply Vcc. In other
words, it might suffice that a resistive divider be
connected between a supply voltage pole and ground, with
the reference voltage being picked up from a resistor
linking node. But this solution is not devoid of serious
problems:
integrated circuit resistors are made to wide
manufacturing tolerances, which disallows their values to
be known with any accuracy; this may result in a reference
voltage being obtained which varies from the target
voltage; andthe integration of the resistors is disadvantageous from
the standpoint of circuit area occupation, which reflects
unfavorably on integrations costs.In addition, the reference voltage may be affected by
thermal drift from the circuit operating temperature and/or
interferences with the supply voltage. An improved
resistive divider can be implemented using a transistor-type
of divider as shown in Figure 1 herewith. A series of
three MOS transistors can provide, for example, a reference
voltage which is unaffected by temperature.The last-mentioned solution would, however, have a drawback
in that it produces a reference voltage which is closely
dependent on the supply voltage Vcc. Furthermore, the
latter voltage cannot amount to anything less than three
times the threshold voltage of the MOS transistors, which
rules out the use of the circuit with low voltages.A voltage regulator is known from the Patent Abstract of
Japan No. JP-A-60 252 923 (HITACHI K.K.). Such a regulator
includes insulation type field effect transistors (IGFETs),
connected in series in order to produce an output reference
voltage, which is the difference between the Fermi voltages
of the IGFETs.Also known from the Patent Abstract of Japan No. JP-A-60
243 717 (HITACHI K.K.) is a semiconductor integrated
circuit device, which includes two MOS transistors and
obtains a reference voltage as difference between their
drain voltages, i.e. their
