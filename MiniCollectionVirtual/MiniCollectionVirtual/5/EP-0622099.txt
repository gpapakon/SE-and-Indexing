<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a belt filter of the flat bed type, in which the filter belt (6) has a purely mechanical belt guidance (8, 10) and a belt cleaning device (38) is provided. The filter belt (6) is advantageously an endless belt. The belt filter is advantageously furnished with a drying aid in a form such that the outlet-side reversal roll has a peripheral surface furnished with orifices.

Gravity filter of the flat bed type, comprising

a filter band (6), a band drive with direction-changing
rollers (2, 4),
a mechanical band guide and a band cleaning device (38,
40),
a purely mechanical band guide which is provided for the
linear travel of the band (6), where a guide (8) is provided

on the guide rollers (2, 4) and corresponding guide means (10)
are provided on the underside of the band,
a filter basin (12),
a trough (28) for collecting liquid underneath the filter
band (6),

characterised in that
rigidly mounted side plates (16, 18) are provided as
lateral boundaries of the filtration chamber (14), with the

undersides of the side plates being curved in such manner that
the band (6) forms a filter basin between the direction-changing

rollers (2, 4), and
the guide (8) includes at least one longitudinal groove
in the direction-changing rollers (2, 4) and projections (10)

are fitted on the underside of the band correspondingly as
guide means in the longitudinal direction, and
the trough (28) comprises a device (34) for supplying the
liquid to the filtration chamber (14).
Band filter according to claim 1, characterised in that
the filter band (6) is an endless band.
Band filter according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that the filter band (6) is a flexible, high-tensile porous

band of a corrosion-resistant material. 
Band filter according to one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the endless band (6) is of stainless

steel or plastics material.
Band filter according to one of claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the projections (10) are guide pins.
Band filter according to one of claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that between the direction-changing rollers

there are provided a guide above the band and corresponding
guide means.
Band filter according to one of claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that the side plates (16, 18) have a sliding

surface for the band (6) on the underside.
Band filter according to claim 7, characterised in that
the side plates are of plastics material.
Band filter according to claim 7 or 8, characterised in
that the side plates have a coating on the underside.
Band filter according to one of claims 1 to 9,
characterised in that the inlet (42) for the solid/liquid

mixture lies opposite the removal location for solid material.
Band filter according to claim 10, characterised in that
a distribution device (46) is provided at the inlet which

extends over substantially the whole width of the band.
Band filter according to one of claims 1 to 11,
characterised in that a cleaning device (38) is provided which

flushes through the filter band with liquid from the clean
side to the dirty side, and wherein below the cleaning device

is provided a collecting device (28) for solids and/or run-off
contaminated cleaning liquid.
Band filter according to claim 12, characterised in that
return means (34, 36) is provided for leakage liquid and any

liquid overflowing from the filtration chamber into the 
collecting device.
Band filter according to claim 12 or 13, characterised
in that the collecting device (26, 28) is provided for the

lateral collection of leakage liquid and contaminated cleaning
liquid.
Band filter according to one of claims 1 to 14,
characterised in that the direction-changing roller on the

discharge side comprises a shell provided with apertures.
Band filter according to one of claims 1 to 15,
characterised in that the direction-changing roller on the

discharge side is a perforated sheet roller.
