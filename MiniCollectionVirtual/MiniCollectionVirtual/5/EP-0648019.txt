A circuitry (to, 1) for increasing the electric strength of a CMOS circuit (3, 5) comprising at least first and second subcircuits (3, 5) which have different operating potentials and are coupled with each other through first and second circuit nodes (k1, k2),

- a cascade circuit (1) serving for absorbing the voltage, which is inserted between the first and second circuit nodes (k1, k2) and comprises at least one p-channel transistor (t) provided in cascade arrangement,
- the at least one p-channel transistor (t) being connected with the first circuit node (k1) by means of its source terminal (S), with the second circuit node (k2) by means of its drain terminal (D), and with the associated output (o) of a bias source (2) by means of its gate terminal (G), the bias source generating a fixed potential (HV) at the gate of the at least one p-channel transistor (t) provided in cascade arrangement, which fixed potential lies between a positive supply voltage (VDD) and a negative supply voltage (VSS),
- the well terminal (W) of the at least one p-channel transistor (t) being connected with a terminal potential which is essentially equal to the respective source potential or is slightly higher than this, and
- the bias source (2) generating the fixed potential(s) (HV or V1, V2, V3) as a function of the level of the positive supply voltage (VDD) such that during a transient effect of the positive supply voltage (VDD), in which the increasing positive supply voltage (VDD) lies between a voltage value of 0V and a further voltage value which is equal to a second limit value (F), the fixed potential(s) (HV; V1, V2, V3) of the negative supply voltage (VSS) is/are equal, and that beyond of these voltage values (0V, F) with a growing level of the positive supply voltage (VDD), the fixed potential(s) (HV; V1, V2, V3) rises/rise with the supply voltage such that a voltage breakthrough will not occur with any voltage value of the positive supply voltage (VDD),
characterised by
 the following features:
- the first subcircuit (3; 3.1; 3.5) comprises between a terminal (4) for the positive supply voltage (VDD) and the first circuit node (k1) a p-channel transistor structure (to) embedded in a n-well (w) and having source, drain and gate regions (s, d and g, respectively), the n-well (w) being connected through a resistor (R; R'), serving for limiting the current in the event of a polarity reversal, with the source terminal (So) of the p-channel transistor structure (to), said source terminal being coupled by a low-impedance path to the positive supply voltage (VDD),
- the drain terminal (Do) of the p-channel transistor structure (to) is coupled to the first circuit node (k1), and
- the gate terminal (Go) of the p-channel transistor structure (to) is fed with one of the fixed potentials (VH; V1, V2, V3) from the bias source (2) in case of a switched protective circuit (3.5), and is fed with the output signal of a regulating circuit (7) in case of a regulated protective circuit (3.1), which regulates the output current (ih) coming from the regulated protective circuit (3.1) and flowing in particular through the cascade circuit (1).
The circuitry according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the bias source (2), at the latest when the maximum value of the positive supply voltage (VDD) is reached, sets the level of the fixed potential(s) (HV or V1, V2, V3) in such a manner that they define sections with essentially the same magnitude with regard to the supply voltage which is available in each case.
The circuitry according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the current regulated by means of the regulating circuit (7) is the operating current (ih) of a co-integrated Hall plate (5.1).
The circuitry according to any one of the claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that
 the second subcircuit (5) comprises an analogue and/or digital signal processing circuit.
The circuitry according to any one of the claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that
 the second subcircuit (5) comprises at least one voltage-proof n-channel transistor (tn).
The circuitry according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the protective circuit (3.1; 3.5) has its well terminal (Wo) connected with a Zener diode or with a field oxide transistor as an overvoltage protection element (se).
