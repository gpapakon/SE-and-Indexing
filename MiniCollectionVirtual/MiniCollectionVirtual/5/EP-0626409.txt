<ABSTRACT>
A method is provided for making 
polycarbonate utilizing an effective amount of a phase 

transfer catalyst, such as tetrabutylammonium bromide 
as a condensation catalyst during the interfacial 

phosgenation of a bisphenol, such as bisphenol A. 
Improved phosgene utilization is achieved.

<DESCRIPTION>
Reference is made to copending applications RD-22,833
(USSN 08/066,380) and RD-22,841 (USSN 08/066,381) filed concurrently
herewith.The present invention relates to a method
for making polycarbonate by phosgenating a bisphenol
in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst (PTC).More particularly, the present invention relates to
the employment of a PTC, such as a tetraalkylammonium
or tetraalkyl phosphonium bromide as a condensation
catalyst for the polymerization of bisphenol under
interfacial reaction conditions.As shown by Freitag et al, The Encylopedia
of Polymer Science and Engineering, John Wiley & Sons,
New York (1988), Second Edition, polycarbonates have
been made by phosgenating bisphenols under interfacial
reaction conditions using a tertiary organic amine,
such as triethylamine as a condensation catalyst.
Although tertiary organic amines having been found to
be effective as bisphenol condensation catalysts,
experience has shown that use of tertiary organic
amines results in excess phosgene usage. Efforts
have been made therefore to develop procedures to
minimize excessive phosgene losses. For example, a
reactor with an overhead condenser can be used to trap
phosgene, as shown by Silva, U.S. patent 4,701,544, or
the rate of heat generated during the course of 
bisphenol condensation can be monitored, as shown by
Brunelle et al, U.S. patent 4,814,420.Although tertiary organic amines have been
found to be highly effective as condensation catalysts
for building polycarbonate molecular weight during
phosgenation, experience has shown that tertiary
organic amines often lead to excessive phosgene usage
as a result of phosgene hydrolysis, and/or
chloroformate hydrolysis prior to the termination of
capping. For example, in a phosgene hydrolysis rate
study, it was found that at a triethylamine
concentration of 6.64 x10-3 M, triethylamine effected
phosgene hydrolysis at a relative rate of greater than
200 compared to a reference value of 1 without
catalyst. With respect to rate of chloroformate
hydrolysis, where a relative value of less than 0.01
has been found for a catalyst-free system,
triethylamine shows a value of greater than 100.In Campbell et al, U.S. patent 4,471,105,
an interfacial polycarbonate poly condensation process
is shown for making sterically hindered polycarbonate
utilizing a quaternary phosphonium amino halide
catalyst. Additional investigations with respect to
phase transfer catalyst usage, such as the synthesis
of copoly(carbonate-thiocarbonate)s from bisphenols
and a mixture of
