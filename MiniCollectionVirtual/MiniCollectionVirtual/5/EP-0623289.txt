<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed to a composition suitable for 
making fuel elements (10) for smoking articles, which comprises at least 

about 
50 weight percent, preferably at least about 60 weight percent, and most 

preferably at least about 70 weight percent powdered elemental carbon, 
preferably carbon obtained from the controlled carbonization of hardwood 

paper pulp. The fuel composition also comprises at least about 1 weight 
percent, preferably at least about 5 weight percent, and most 

preferably at 
least about 10 weight percent of a suitable binder. The fuel 

composition of 
the present invention can include at least about 3 weight percent, 

preferably at least about 5 weight percent, and most preferably at least 
about 8 weight percent powdered graphite. Finally, the fuel composition 

of 
the present invention can include at least about 1 weight percent, 

preferably at least about 2 weight percent, and most preferably at least 
about 3 weight percent of a suitable inorganic filler such as calcium 

carbonate, or the like. If necessary or desired, other additives can be 
included in the fuel compositions of the present invention, including 

up to 
about 10 weight percent powdered tobacco and/or up to about 1.5 weight 

percent sodium carbonate; and the like.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to improvements in smoking 
articles, particularly smoking articles employing tobacco. Cigarettes, 
cigars and pipes are popular smoking articles which use tobacco in 
various forms. Many products have been proposed as improvements 
upon, or alternatives to, the various popular smoking articles. For 
example, numerous references have proposed articles which generate a 
flavored vapor and/or a visible aerosol. Most of such articles have 
employed a combustible fuel source to provide an aerosol and/or to heat 
an aerosol forming material. See, for example, the background art cited in 
U.S. Patent No. 4,714,082 to Banerjee et al. The present invention relates to smoking articles such as cigarettes, 
and in particular to those smoking articles having a short fuel element and 
a physically separate aerosol generating means. Smoking articles of this 
type, as well as materials, methods and/or apparatus useful therein and/or 
for preparing them, are described in the following U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,708,151 
to Shelar; 4,714,082 to Banerjee et al.; 4,732,168 to Resce; 4,756,318 to 
Clearman et al.; 4,782,644 to Haarer et al.; 4,793,365 to Sensabaugh et 
al.; 4,802,568 to Haarer et al.; 4,827,950 to Banerjee et al.; 4,870,748 to  
 
Hensgen et al.; 4,881,556 to Clearman et al.; 4,893,637 to Hancock et al.; 
4,893,639 to White; 4,903,714 to Barnes et al.; 4,917128 to Clearman et 
al.; 4,928,714 to Shannon; 4,938,238 to Barnes et al., 4,989,619 to 
Clearman et al., 5,027,837 to Clearman et al., 5,038,802 to White et al., 
5,042,509 to Banerjee et al., 5,052,413 to Baker et al., 5,060,666 to 
Clearman et al., 5,065,776 to Lawson et al., 5,067,499 to Banerjee et al., 
5,076,292 to Sensabaugh et al., 5,076,297 to Farrier et al, 5,088,507 to 
Baker et al., 5,099,861 to Clearman et al., 5,101,839 to Jakob et al., 
5,105,831 to Banerjee et al., and 5,105,837 to Barnes et al., as well as in 
the monograph entitled Chemical and Biological Studies of New Cigarette 
Prototypes That Heat Instead of Burn Tobacco, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco 
Company, 1988 (hereinafter "RJR Monograph"). These smoking articles 
are capable of providing the smoker with the pleasures of smoking (e.g., 
smoking taste, feel, satisfaction, and the like). Such smoking articles 
typically provide low yields of visible sidestream smoke as well as low 
yields of FTC tar when smoked. The smoking articles described in the aforesaid patents and/or 
publications generally employ a combustible fuel element for heat 
generation and an
