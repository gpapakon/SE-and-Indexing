<ABSTRACT>
A ski binding has a heel piece movable in the longitudinal direction with respect to a ski-fixed guide (2), which can be clamped in different positions by a locking piece (3) mounted in a housing (3) which can be slidingly moved pressable in the longitudinal direction and pressed by means of a spring (13) against a stop (14) fixed to the housing and is also tiltable to a limited extent. The locking piece (5) with catching means (10) is tilted by means of a spring (13) which engages it above the stop (14) in the direction of counter-catching means (15) of the ski-fixed guide (2). A two-armed opening lever (16) releases the catch. One arm of the opening lever (16) is substantially U-shaped, seen from behind. The bar (18) which links its two branches engages from below the rear end of the locking piece (5) and both branches of the opening lever (16) extend upwards form the linking bar (18) up to a bearing point (17) on the housing (3). At least one of the branched of the opening lever (16) is bent forwards at the side of the housing (3), forming a branch section which at its free end bears an outwardly projecting handling portion (23a).

<CLAIMS>
A ski binding comprising a heel assembly mounted for 
sliding displacement in the longitudinal direction relative 

to a guide (2) fixedly positioned on a ski, and adapted to 
be locked at different positions, a housing (3) containing 

a locking member (5) mounted for sliding displacement in the 
longitudinal direction and biased by a spring (13) into 

abutment with a stop (14) fixedly connected to said housing 

for limited pivotal movement thereabout, said locking member 
(5) being provided with detent means (10) adapted to be 

engaged with complementary detent means (15) of said ski-mounted 
guide (2), said locking member (5) being pivotally 

biased with its detent means (10) in the direction of said 
complementary detent means (15) by the engagement therewith 

of said spring (13) above said stop (14), a two-armed 
release lever (16) mounted in said housing (3) having one of 

its lever arms provided with handle means while its other 
lever arm engages the rear end of said locking member (5), 

the pivoting of said release lever (16) causing said locking 
member (15) to pivot away from said guide (2) and said 

detent means to be disengaged,
 
characterized in that as viewed from the rear, the lever arm 

of said release lever (16, 16') acting on said locking 
member (5) is of substantially U-shaped configuration, with 

the cross-bar (18, 18') interconnecting its two legs (19a, b; 
19'a,b) engaging the rear end of said locking member (5) 

from below, the two legs (19a,b; 19'a,b) of said release 
lever (16, 16') extending upwards from said cross bar (18, 

18') to a mounting location (17) on said housing (3), and 
that at least one leg (19a; 19'a) of said release lever (16, 

16') is angularly extended by a leg portion (22a; 22'a) 
extending forwards along the side of said housing (3) with 

its free end portion carrying an outwards protruding handling 
projection (23a; 23'a).  

 
A ski binding according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the second leg (19b) of said release lever (16) is 

likewise angularly extended by a leg portion (22b) extending 
forwards along the side of said housing (3) in parallel to 

the first leg portion (20b) of said release lever (16) and 
likewise provided with a laterally outwards protruding 

handling projection (23b). 
A ski binding according to claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the or each leg (19a,b; 19'a,b) of said release 

lever (16, 16') is formed with an outwards directed crank 
bend portion (21a,b; 21'a,b) adjacent the junction between 

its first leg portion (20a, 20b; 20' a) and its second leg 
portion (22a,b; 22'a). 
A ski binding according to claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that said locking member (5) consists of a bearing and 

spring guide body (6) and a locking plate (7) provided at 
its rear end with an upwards directed offset portion (11) 

engaged from below by said cross bar (18) interconnecting 
said two legs (19a,b; 19'a,b) of said U-shaped release 

lever (16, 16'). 
A ski binding according to claim 4, characterized in 
that said locking member (5) has the lower portion of its 

bearing and spring guide body (6) provided with skid projections 
(24) adapted to take support on said ski-mounted 

guide.
