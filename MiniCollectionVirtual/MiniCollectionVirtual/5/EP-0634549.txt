<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to self-closing latches and in 
particular, to a new and improved latch suitable for use on motor 
vehicles, cabinet doors and the like, where it is desirable for 
the door to latch closed automatically. Various forms of self-closing latches have been utilized 
in the past. These prior designs suffer from a variety of 
problems and it is an object of the present invention to provide a 
new and improved latch which will eliminate or overcome such 
disadvantages. Most latches have the bolt positioned at a fixed 
location. When such latches are used on storage compartment doors 
of trucks or motor homes, they sometimes end up facing the wrong 
direction. It is generally desirable to have the handle pointing 
toward the rear of the vehicle or downward, so it does not catch 
on tree branches or other obstacles. In latch installations where 
the handle is pointing upward, the finger well can fill with mud 
or snow and ice, and cause the latch to become inoperative. 
Automobiles do not have this problem because the door latches are 
designed specifically for each model, but for trucks and other 
large vehicles, existing designs are purchased whenever possible. Many of the latches being used today are either 
overdesigned or underdesigned for use on storage compartment 
doors. Some latches are intended for driver and passenger doors 
and are overweight because of the heavy duty all-metal 
construction that is required for strength. Other latches  
 
intended for simple interior cabinetry do not have the design 
integrity to handle the vibration and mechanical abuse that is 
present on a motor vehicle. In many presently available latches, 
the linkage mechanism for actuating the latch bolt and locking 
feature is too complex and requires a large number of components. It is an object of the present invention to provide a 
new and improved latch which is self-closing, and one which can 
be locked and still be self-closing. It is another particular 
object of the invention to provide a latch with a bolt design 
which can be used for left or right hand operation and which can 
be mounted on a door or panel or the like in a variety of 
orientations. Another object of the invention is to provide a 
latch which can be substantially water-tight so that there is 
little or no water leakage through the latch structure. An 
additional object is to provide such a latch with a new and 
improved double-axle bushing for pivoting of the handle in the 
latch housing. A further specific object of the
