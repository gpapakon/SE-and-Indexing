<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is a cooking appliance or an 
electronic control for a cooking appliance and method of 

controlling the same. A remote control unit having a built-in 
temperature sensor, positional switch and low-battery detection 

circuit is in two-way intermittent wireless communication with 
the appliance control unit of the present invention. The 

appliance control unit includes a switch means for controlling 
the heating elements of the cooking appliance wherein the switch 

means for each heating element includes two power switches 
connected in series and coupled with a redundancy detection 

circuit for the detection of a failure of one of the two power 
switches. Two-way communication between the two control units of 

the present invention is constantly monitored to ensure proper 
operation of the cooking appliance and to provide a mechanism to 

report errors to the user or to shut down the cooking appliance, 
as appropriate, soon after an error is detected. Mechanisms are 

also provided whereby the wireless communication means of the 
control units may be diagnosed to ensure the control units are 

properly communicating with each other.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the control of
a domestic appliance and, in particular, to a remote control
system for the control of a cooking appliance.Traditionally, controls for the operation of a
cooking appliance such as controls for the heating elements
of a cooktop surface as found on an electric range
have been located either on the cooktop surface or on
a surface which extends vertically from the rear or front
of the cooktop surface. Each of these locations have
caused problems for either the consumer or the manufacturer.Selectors, such as buttons or knobs, located
on the cooktop surface are susceptible to the collection
of dust, food particles and grease thereon and are often
subjected to intense heat from the proximately located
heating elements. Usually, such cooktop-positioned
controls are readily accessible and visible to the operator,
but, undesirably, may also be accessible to small
children. Furthermore, such controls detract from the
space available on the cooktop surface for the heating
elements and cause the area around the controls to be
difficult to clean.Many manufacturers of electric ranges place
the heating element control selectors on a surface extending
vertically from the rear of the cooktop surface.
This allows the cooktop surface to be used solely for the
heating elements and makes the selectors much less
accessible to children. Such selectors are also susceptible
to collecting dusts, grease and food particles, but
due to their vertical orientation, may be less affected
than are cooktop surface positioned controls. However,
these rear controls pose additional hazards for the operator
as the individual may incur burns or the individual's
clothing may be scorched or set on fire when reaching
over hot heating elements or over spattering or
steaming foods located on the cooktop in order to adjust
the controls. Furthermore, rear controls and displays are
difficult for some operators to see and the vertical orientation
imposes difficulty for some in interpreting the displays
or the position of selectors.Detached control panels for cooktop surfaces
have been developed in which the control panel is installed
in a countertop proximate the cooktop surface
and communicates via wiring to the cooktop surface. Although
detached control panels are easy to see and allow
the cooktop surface to be used solely for the heating
elements, installation of the detached control panel decreases
available countertop surface, is limited by the
length of cable provided, and increases the
