<ABSTRACT>
To ensure interference-free transmission of digital information, oscillators with a high quality factor and reliability and a long life are needed. For these purposes, voltage-controlled oscillators are used which are tuned via a microprocessor and a digital/analogue converter and are part of a phase-locked loop. In these arrangements, a compromise must be found between control range and stability, the control characteristic is not linear and resolution is limited by the step length of the digital/analogue converter. In the method according to the invention and the circuit arrangement used for it, an oscillator is specified, the frequency of which can be varied linearly within a wide control range without influencing the stability of the oscillator. The circuit is supplied with a conventional 5-V operating voltage. For this purpose the frequency of a fixed-frequency generator (1) is divided to the desired frequency by means of a frequency divider (2), the divider ratio of which can be varied in very small steps, and the resultant jitter is filtered by means of a simple phase-locked loop (3). The oscillator can be universally used as clock generator in all digital circuit arrangements.
