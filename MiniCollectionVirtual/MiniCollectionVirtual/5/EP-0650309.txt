<ABSTRACT>
A hearing aid with a microphone, a preamplifier following the microphone and connected to a voltage-controlled circuit processing the signals, which exhibits, for example, a voltage-controlled filter and which, in turn, is connected to an output amplifier which drives an earpiece. To provide for optimum matching, it is provided that the voltage-controlled circuit processing the signals is connected to a signal-analysing circuit (MAC) which controls the voltage-controlled circuit and which is connected at the input to the preamplifier or output amplifier (30, 50) and is essentially formed by a Hilbert circuit (HS), the two outputs of which (A, F), supplying the instantaneous values of the frequency and the amplitude of the input signal, are connected via high-pass filters (HP1, HP2) to the inputs of similar Hilbert circuits, and the outputs of all three Hilbert circuits are connected to control inputs of a voltage-controlled signal-processing circuit (40).
