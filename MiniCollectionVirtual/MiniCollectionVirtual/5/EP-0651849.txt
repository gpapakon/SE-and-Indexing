Device for operating a pivotable closing element such 
as a pivoting window or roof of a vehicle, of the type 

comprising a connecting rod articulated at one end on the 
said closing element and of which the other end is 

connected to a rotating piece carrying one end of a cable 
arranged to wind and unwind on at least a part of the said 

rotating piece, the other end of the said cable being 
firmly fixed to a driving member, characterised in that the 

articulated connecting rod and the rotating piece (3) are 
linked by means of a conical pinion (4) engaged with a 

toothed sector (5) of the said rotating piece (3), the axis 
of the said conical pinion being substantially orthogonal 

to the axis of rotation of the said rotating piece (3), the 
driving member being comprised of a pneumatic linear 

actuator (6) mounted on a support (12) firmly fixed to a 
casing (9, 10) receiving the said rotating piece (3). 
Operating device according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the said cable (1) is extended by a second cable (18) 

of which one of the ends is carried by the rotating piece 
(3), the said cables (1, 18) being disposed so that 

traction on one or other of the cables (1, 18) rotates the 
rotating piece (3) in one direction or the other. 
Operating device according to claim 2, characterised in 
that the free end of the second cable (18) is firmly fixed 

to a second pneumatic linear actuator. 
Operating device according to claim 2, characterised in 
that the end of the second cable (18) is firmly fixed to 

the diaphragm of the pneumatic linear actuator (6), which 
separates two chambers which can be placed under negative 

pressure respectively.  
 
Operating device according to claim 4, characterised in 
that the other chamber of the pneumatic linear actuator (6) 

is placed under excess pressure. 
Operating device according to claim 1, characterised in 
that an elastic return means disposed in the proximity of 

the rotating piece (3) drives the rotating piece (3) in a 
rotating movement in the opposite direction to that 

controlled by the actuator (6). 
Operating device according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the rotating piece (3) is a pulley. 
Operating device according to one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the rotating piece (3) comprises 

radial projections (7
a
, 7
b
) for guiding the cable (1, 18). 
Operating device according to one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that the whole of the device except the 

actuator (6) is disposed inside a casing (9) comprised of 
two complementarily-shaped, mutually-juxtaposed elements, 

the two elements being provided with projecting portions 
(8
a
, 8
b
, 8
c
) and recesses in such a way as to form a 
conduit for guiding the cable (1, 18) and to provide 

apertures (19) for the passage of the cable (1, 18) outside 
the casing (9). 
Operating device according to one of claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that at least one of the elements of the 

casing (9) comprises a projecting portion which passes into 
an axial bore of the rotating piece (3) to form the axis of 

rotation of the rotating piece (3). 
Operating device according to one of claims 1 to 10, 
characterised in that the elements of the casing (9) are  

 
provided at one of their ends with an indexed sector (11) 

for prepositioning, intended to cooperate with 
complementary arrangements on the support (12) of the 

actuator so as to permit a variation in the angular 
position of the actuator (6) during assembly.
