<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to copolymers of ethylene and 
longer α-olefins. More particularly, this invention relates 
to high molecular weight ethylene copolymers of α-olefins 
having from 10 to 100 carbon atoms. This invention also relates 
to a process for copolymerizing ethylene with longer 
α-olefins utilizing certain transition metal compounds from 
Group IV B of the Periodic Table of Elements that produces 
high molecular weight copolymers. Prior art copolymers of ethylene and longer α-olefins, 
i.e. olefins having about 10 or more carbon atoms, have 
suffered a number of disadvantages. Primarily, it has not 
been possible to prepare such copolymers, having 
sufficiently high molecular weight for most applications, 
using a traditional Ziegler-Natta catalyst. Generally, as 
the longer α-olefin comonomer content increases, the 
molecular weight decreases significantly. Also, the 
ethylene copolymers have had a very broad molecular weight 
distribution, as well as a broad α-olefin composition 
distribution. This arises from the prior art catalyst 
systems having a high ratio of ethylene:comonomer 
reactivity, as well as a low ratio of polymerization 
propagation to termination. As a result, the low molecular 
weight species have substantially higher α-olefin comonomer 
content and the high molecular weight species have a very 
low comonomer content. It has been proposed to use certain metallocenes such 
as bis(cyclopentadienyl) titanium or zirconium dialkyls in 
combination with aluminum alkyl/water cocatalyst as a 
homogeneous catalyst system for the polymerization of 
olefins. For example: German Patent Application 2,608,863 
teaches the use of a catalyst system for the polymerization 
of ethylene consisting of bis(cyclopentadienyl) titanium 
dialkyl, aluminum trialkyl and water; German Patent 
Application 2,608,933 teaches an ethylene polymerization 
catalyst system consisting of zirconium metallocenes of the  
 
general formula (cyclopentadienyl)nZrY4-n, wherein n stands 
for an integer in the range of 1 to 4, Y for R, CH2AlR2, 
CH2CH2AlR2 and CH2CH(AlR2)2, wherein R stands for alkyl or 
metallo alkyl, an aluminum trialkyl cocatalyst and water; 
European Patent Application No. 0035242 teaches a process 
for preparing ethylene and atactic propylene polymers in the 
presence of a halogen-free Ziegler catalyst system of (1) 
cyclopentadienyl compound of the formula 
(cyclopentadienyl)nMY4-n in which n is an integer from 1 to 
4, M is a transition metal, especially zirconium, and Y is 
either hydrogen,
