<ABSTRACT>
A plastic, three-part adjustable stop comprising 
a carrier member (11) that can be mounted, for example, on a 

door frame, an axially adjustable stop member (16) carried in a 
bore (12) provided in the carrier member and a rotatable 

locking member (20) operable to lock the stop member (16) in a 
preferred position in the carrier member (11). To install the 

stop, the assembly is mounted in the door frame, the door 
is closed so that the stop member (16) is pushed into the 

carrier member (11) whereupon the stop member (16) is locked in the 
position by rotation of the locking member (20). The stop 

subsequently ensures that the door always closes to the 
same position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a bump stop 
used to cushion the impact of a moving element such as a 
door. Such stops may be found, for example, in motor 
vehicles, fastened to a car body to accommodate a limit of 
movement of a car door. It is desirable to fit such a 
stop to the car body and then to adjust it to fit the 
desired position of the car door. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide an adjustable stop that can easily be adjusted and 
then secured in its correct position. According to the present invention we provide a 
three-part adjustable stop assembly made of plastics 
material comprising a carrier member adapted to be 
fastened to a substrate and provided with a bore normal to 
the substrate, the inner surface of the bore having a 
series of closely-spaced peripheral ridges, a stop member 
having a resilient hollow stem having the same section and 
being adapted and arranged to fit within the bore of the 
carrier member and having an external surface formed with 
a series of closely-spaced peripheral ridges corresponding 
to the series of peripheral ridges in said bore and a 
rotatable locking member located in axial alignment within 
said hollow stem, said locking member having at least two 
cam flanges which, when the locking member is rotated 
through, say 90Â°, bind against the inner wall of the 
hollow stem so that the stem is expanded and locks 
together the series of peripheral ridges on the inner 
surface of the bore and the series of peripheral ridges on 
the external surface of the hollow stem. The carrier member may have a base flange by 
which it can be screwed or, bolted to the substrate or 
secured by adhesive or it may be adapted to engage a 
fastener such as a weld stud fixed to the substrate. The bore and hollow stem may be of round or 
rectangular section but are preferably of square section.  The series of peripheral ridges formed in the 
inner surface of the bore and the external surface of the 
hollow stem may be a series of annular ridges or, if the 
stem and bore are of round section may take the form of a 
tight helical thread. A pair of cam flanges may be provided on 
diametrically opposite sides of the locking member or 
three or four cam flanges may be disposed, preferably 
symmetrically, round the locking member. The locking 
member is provided with turning means such as a hexagonal 
cavity or a slot whereby it can be turned using a tool 
such as an Allen key or a screwdriver. The axes of the locking member, of the hollow 
stem and of the bore

A three-part adjustable stop assembly made 
of plastics material comprising a carrier member adapted 

to be fastened to a substrate and provided with a bore 
normal to the substrate, the inner surface of the bore 

having a series of closely-spaced peripheral ridges, a 
stop member having a hollow stem having the same section 

and being adapted and arranged to fit within the bore of 
the carrier member and having an external surface formed 

with a series of closely-spaced peripheral ridges 
corresponding to the series of peripheral ridges in said 

bore and a rotatable locking member located in axial 
alignment within said hollow stem, said locking member 

having at least two cam flanges which, when the locking 
barrel is rotated through 90 bind against the inner wall 

of the hollow stem so that the stem is expanded and locks 
together the series of peripheral ridges on the inner 

surface of the bore and the series of peripheral ridges on 
the external surface of the hollow stem. 
An adjustable stop according to Claim 1, 
wherein the carrier member has a base flange by which it 

can be screwed or bolted to the substrate or secured by 
adhesive. 
An adjustable stop according to Claim 1, 
wherein the carrier member is adapted to engage a fastener 

such as a weld stud fixed to the substrate. 
An adjustable stop according to Claim 1, 2 
or 3, wherein the bore in the carrier member and the 

hollow stem of the stop member are of rectangular, 
preferably square, section. 
An adjustable stop according to Claim 1, 2 
or 3, wherein the bore in the carrier member and the 

hollow stem of the stop member are round in section. 
An adjustable stop according to any one of 
Claims 1 to 5 wherein the series of peripheral ridges 

formed in the inner surface of the bore and the external 
surface of the hollow stem are a series of annular ridges. 
An adjustable stop according to Claim 5, 
wherein the series of peripheral ridges formed in the 

inner surface of the bore and the external surface of the 
hollow stem take the form of a tight helical thread. 
An adjustable stop according to any one of 
the preceding claims, wherein a pair of cam flanges are 

provided on diametrically opposite sides of the locking 
member. 
An adjustable stop according to any one of 
the preceding claims, wherein three or four cam flanges 

are disposed, preferably symmetrically, round the locking 
member. 
An adjustable stop according to any one of 
the preceding claims, wherein the hollow stem carries a 

profiled head. 
An adjustable stop according to any one of 
the preceding claims, wherein the stop member and the 

locking member are moulded at the same time by a one-shot 
injection moulding process.
