<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed are sterile surgical needles 
comprising a protective layer or cap which encases the 

tip of the needle and which is adherent to the tip and 
removable therefrom manually. The needle may have a 

friction-reducing coating of a silicone polymer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to surgical
needles.Surgical needles have been known for some time
and such needles with sutures attached are commonly used
in various types of surgical procedures. The surgical
needles are usually made from stainless steel and have a
blunt end to which a suture is attached. The blunt end
may be drilled or have a channel placed therein and the
suture is usually swaged or crimped in the drilled hole
or channel. In order to reduce trauma in placing
sutures in tissue, the suture itself generally has a
diameter less than the diameter of the needle. Also,
the point and cutting edge of the needle should be made
as sharp as possible so as to require as little force as
possible to penetrate the tissue and place the suture
and consequently to cause the least amount of trauma to
the sutured area.Surgical needles are straight or curved, that
is, they have the shape of some part of a circle. This
may be from a quarter of a circle to five-eighths of a
circle. At one end of the needle is the point or the
extreme tip of the needle. The section from that point
to the maximum width of the needle is termed the "blade"
of the needle. In cutting needles, the blade includes
the cutting edge from the point towards the blunt end.
Behind the cutting edge is the body portion of the
needle; that is, the area of the needle to be grasped by
an appropriate needle holder. At the blunt end of the 
needle is the swage or the portion of the needle into
which the suture is inserted and affixed. In placing
the needle, the needle is grasped by a suitable needle
holder which usually is a forceps type instrument that
grasps the needle at the body portion with sufficient
force to insure that the needle will not move or turn in
the instrument when the needle is being placed by the
surgeon.Use of a needle can exert stressing forces on
the needle, since the force used to drive the needle
into and through tissue (e.g., a blood vessel, the
cornea of the eye, and the like) needs to be sufficient
to drive the needle and overcome frictional drag through
the tissue. If the frictional drag is excessive, then
applying this force along the shaft of the needle from
the point at which the needle is held risks causing the
needle to flex, which is undesirable as it causes loss
of control of the needle.The cutting edge and the point of the needle
should also be as sharp as possible. The harder the
needle the sharper it can be made. The sharper the
needle, the less force required to make the initial
penetration and the less the
