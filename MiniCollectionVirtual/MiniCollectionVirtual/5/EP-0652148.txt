<ABSTRACT>
Running gear with adjustable axle for double-axle rail vehicles to be used for solving the problem of providing automatic radial adjustment in bends in the track, a high degree of operational quietness in straight sections of track and of avoiding, under extreme conditions, counter-radial adjustments when there is only a small amount of installation space. According to the invention, this is achieved by the combination of the following features: an imaginary rotational and coupling point is provided in the centre of the wheel set by directly coupling the wheel set (8) by means of axle and wheel set links (1) and a compensation device (5). The vertical, lateral and longitudinal movements of the axle bearings or wheel-set bearings (2) are damped by hydraulic dampers (22) and the spring constant and characteristic in all three coordinates are adjusted by means of helical springs (10) with a defined degree of lateral rigidity with additional partial effect of elastomer padding (3).

<CLAIMS>
Steering-axle running gear having coil springs, 
axle or wheel-set links (1), axle or wheel-set bearings 

(2) and wheel set or axle, characterized in that the axle 
or wheel-set bearings (2) are mounted in the axle or 

wheel-set link (1) in a cardanically elastic manner by 
means of elastomeric cushions (3), the axle or wheel-set 

link (1) being linked at one end to a compensating device 
(5) by an elastic spherical bearing (4), and coil springs 

(10) being arranged on or next to spring-deflection 
limiting devices (11) on both sides next to the axle or 

wheel-set bearings (2) in a transversely elastic manner 
between underframe or vehicle frame (27) and axle or 

wheel set link (1), and hydraulic dampers (22) being 
arranged vertically between underframe or vehicle frame 

(27) and axle or wheel-set bearing (2) or axle or wheel-set 
link (1), longitudinally between underframe or 

vehicle frame (27) and compensating device (5) and 
laterally between underframe or vehicle frame (27) and a 

cross-member (21) or axle or wheel-set link (1), the 
compensating device (5) containing a compensating lever 

(6) or an inclined compensating shaft (23) or a longitudinally 
loaded compensating rod (28) having deflection 

angles (29), and a disc-brake unit (16) being supported 
via an articulated suspension device (17, 17a) on the 

compensating device (5) and on the two axle or wheel-set 
links (1). 
Steering-axle running gear according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that an eccentric torque support (26) of 

axle gearing (25) is linked to the compensating device 
(5).  

 
Steering-axle running gear according to Claims 1 
and 2, characterized in that the spring-deflection 

limiting devices (11) limit the longitudinal and transverse 
play at their bottom end in interaction with 

flexible lateral stops (12) which are connected to the 
axle or wheel-set link (1).
