<ABSTRACT>
The metering device includes a storage tank 3, a positive-displacement extractor 30 which introduces coarsely calibrated metered quantities of material into an intermediate hopper 4 which is periodically emptied into a weighing hopper 1. Below the latter, a fast-stabilization balance (scales) 2 measures the weight of the metered quantity contained in the weighing hopper 1. The latter is emptied onto the belt 5 after a delay proportional to the weight of the metered quantity or of one of the preceding metered quantities.

A metering device comprising: 

a reservoir (3) containing the material to be 
metered, 
an extractor (30) for withdrawing the material to 
be metered from the reservoir (3) in a controlled 

manner, 
 
characterised in that it comprises: 


an intermediate hopper (4) receiving the material 
which is introduced therein by the extractor (30), 
a weighing hopper (1) receiving the material which 
is introduced therein when the intermediate hopper 

(4) is opened in order to empty it, 
weighing means (2) giving the weight of the 
material contained in the weighing hopper (1) when 

the two hoppers are closed, 
means for triggering the following sequence of 
operations: opening the weighing hopper (1) in 

order to empty it, then closing it after a given 
delay, then opening the intermediate hopper (4) in 

order to transfer the contents thereof into the 
weighing hopper (1), then closing it after another 

given delay, 
means for adjusting the time interval elapsing 
between a given sequence and the following 

sequence on the basis of the measurements from the 
weighing means, as a function of the desired 

nominal weight output. 
A metering device according to claim 1, 
characterised in that it moreover comprises means for 

removing the series of successive weighings, these 
means being capable of effecting smoothing of said 

successive weighings coming from the weighing hopper,  
 

and making it possible to deliver a substantially 
continuous output of material. 
A device according to claim 2, characterised 
in that the smoothing means are formed by a vibrating 

belt (5) or an inclined vibrating ramp (5'). 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that said extractor (30) is a 

volumetric extractor. 
A device according to claim 4, characterised 
in that said volumetric extractor (30) extracts the 

material in successive batches introduced one after the 
other into the intermediate hopper (4). 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the quantity of material 

withdrawn by the extractor (30) is determined as a 
function of a chosen number of preceding weighings, or 

a chosen number of preceding time intervals, and by 
comparing these values to desired mean values. 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the time interval elapsing 

between two sequences is calculated from the weight of 
material recorded during one of the weighings preceding 

that carried out just before triggering a sequence of 
operations. 
A metering method consisting of continuously 
repeating the following cycle: 


a) introducing a unit quantity of material into a 
weighing hopper, 
b) recording the weight of the unit quantity in order 
to characterise a weighing, 
c) removing the quantity of material contained in the 
weighing hopper at the end of a time interval proportional 

to the weight stored in memory during a 
weighing effected in one of the cycles preceding the 

current cycle, and as a function of the desired output. 
A metering method according to claim 8, 
characterised in that a unit quantity of material is  

 
introduced into said weighing hopper by withdrawing one 

batch. 
A method according to claim 9, characterised 
in that the quantity of material in each batch is 

regulated as a function of the mean weight of the 
preceding weighings or of the time interval elapsing 

between two successive removals of a weighing, and as a 
function of the desired theoretical output. 
A metering method according to claim 8,
 
characterised in that, in order to introduce a unit 

quantity of material into said weighing hopper, 
material is withdrawn in a continuous flow from a 

storage reservoir, this flow is transferred during a 
given time towards the weighing hopper, then this 

continuous flow of material is branched off in order to 
reintroduce it into the reservoir, during the time 

necessary to record the weight, then emptying the 
quantity of material already introduced into the 

weighing hopper, and, as soon as the weighing hopper 
has been emptied of its contents, the flow of material 

is transferred again briefly in order to allow the 
material to enter again into the weighing hopper. 
A metering method according to claim 11,
 
characterised in that the continuously withdrawn flow 

is regulated as a function of the mean weight of the 
preceding weighings or of the time interval elapsing 

between two successive removals of a weighing, and as a 
function of the desired theoretical output.
