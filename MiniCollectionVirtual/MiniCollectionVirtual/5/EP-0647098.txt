<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus and methods of fabricating half products in the field of puffed snack piece fabrication are disclosed including a rotary cutter (16) having an opposed pair of rollers (18). At least one of the rollers (18) of the rotary cutter (16) has cavities (112) arranged in a first portion (110) which stamp out first pieces and cavities (118) arranged in second and third portions (114, 116) for stamping out second pieces from the remaining portions of a continuous dough sheet (14). The first pieces are of the desired shape and size for the half products, and the second pieces are of a size and shape mechanically separable from the first pieces. After stamping, the first and second pieces are dried in an oven (134) and then separated by a separator (136). The dried first pieces form the half product. The dried second pieces can be ground in a grinder (138) and added to the ingredients (120) forming the dough prior to or during mixing in mixer (122).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to
apparatus and methods for recouping scrap material, and
particularly to apparatus and methods for recouping
scrap material remaining after the desired shaped and
sized pieces are cut from a continuous dough sheet for
the preparation of a snack product by conventional deep
fat frying.US 3124990 (Anetsberger et al.) discloses apparatus
for cutting substantially annular doughnut blanks from a
sheet of dough. The cutting of the blanks leaves
marginal scrap strips at the edges of the sheet.
However, there is no mention of reusing or recouping
these scrap strips.One type of snack product which has gained wide
market acceptance is the "puffed" snack product. In
certain methods of preparation, a cooked farinaceous
dough is formed into a single continuous dough sheet.
This dough sheet is then run through a piece forming
apparatus or rotary cutter which includes an opposed
pair of rollers at least one of which has depressions
which stamp out the desired shape and size pieces from
the dough sheet. After formation of the dough pieces,
the pieces are dried under controlled conditions from a
moisture content of about 18% down to a moisture content
of between 10% and 15% to form a half product or pellet.
The moisture content of the half product is sufficiently
low to exhibit extended shelf stability. The snack 
product is prepared from the half product by conventional
deep fat frying. The frying of the half product generates
steam volumes inside of the half product to puff the half
product resulting in a light, puffed snack product having
surface corrugations.The sale of snack food products is a highly
competitive business. The novelty of snack food products
decline rapidly, as new and different types of snack
foods are introduced to maintain or increase market share.
Puffed snack products can be varied in various ways such
as by changing the shapes, sizes, and surface corrugations
of the pieces or by changing the composition of the dough
from which the half products are prepared. Another
variation is to have the puffed snack product of a hollow
structure, with the hollow configuration resulting from
the fabrication of the half products from a two-layer
laminated dough sheet. One method of forming a laminated
dough sheet is to fold a single continuous dough sheet
into a two-plied dough sheet as set forth in U.S. Patent
Nos. 5,092,757 and 5,217,739.As set forth previously, the frying of the half
product generates steam volumes inside of the half
product to puff the half
