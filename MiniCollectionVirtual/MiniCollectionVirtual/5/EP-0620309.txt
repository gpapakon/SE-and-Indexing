<ABSTRACT>
An activated-carbon solvent treatment unit for dry-cleaning 
machines with improved regeneration unit which 

comprises a cylindrical container (2) with a vertical axis 
that extends vertically and has a convex hood (7) and base 

(6); the container (2) is internally provided with a 
deflector (10) that forms an activated-carbon containment 

compartment (11) in an upward region and, in a downward 
region, a water containment compartment (12) which contains 

heating elements (13) that are suitable to generate steam 
for flushing the carbon; said upward region and said lower 

region of said container (2) are connected by a flushing 
water return duct (14) that includes a condensation unit 

(15) and a water-solvent separator (16).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an activated-carbon 
solvent treatment unit for dry-cleaning machines with 
improved regeneration unit. Dry-cleaning machines are known which include the so-called 
deodorization cycle in order to eliminate residual 
solvent traces from the cleaned garments: in practice, the 
washing drum is flushed by a stream of warm air that is able 
to remove even small traces of solvent and moisture from the 
garments; this stream is discharged outside through an 
activated-carbon filter which is suitable to recover part of 
the solvent present in the expelled air. When the carbon is saturated with solvent, the 
activated-carbon filters are flushed in countercurrent with 
superheated steam for a so-called regeneration cycle: after 
flowing through the filter, the contact water is discharged 
into the sewage system. At present, however, due to more restrictive pollution-control 
rules, the discharge of water containing solvent is 
no longer allowed if the solvent percentage exceeds 
extremely low values. A regeneration unit for activated-carbon used as filtering means in a dry-cleaning apparatus is known from US-A-4 513 510. In addition to this, conventional activated-carbon 
filters have some drawbacks related to the fact that often 
the shape, dimensions and orientation of the filter are not 
such as to produce effective air treatment. The technical aim of the present invention is to 
obviate the above described drawbacks of conventional 
devices, i.e. to provide an activated-carbon solvent 
treatment unit for dry-cleaning machines with an improved  
 
regeneration unit that does not entail the discharge of 
contact water containing solvent traces into the sewage 
system and produces very high solvent absorption. Within the scope of this technical aim, an object of 
the present invention is to achieve the above aim and 
objects with a structure which is simple, relatively easy to 
produce in practice, safe in use and effective in operation, 
and has a relatively low cost. This aim and these objects are all achieved by the 
present activated-carbon solvent treatment unit for dry-cleaning 
machines with improved regeneration unit, 
characterized in that it comprises a cylindrical container 
with a vertical axis that extends vertically and has a 
convex hood and base, said container being internally 
provided with a deflector that forms an activated-carbon 
containment compartment in an upward region and, in a 
downward region, a water containment compartment which 
contains heating
