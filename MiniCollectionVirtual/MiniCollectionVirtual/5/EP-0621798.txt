<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for playing games relating to time comprises two dice and a clock. The dice (12, 13) are dodecahedral. One dice represents hours and has its facets numbered from 1 to 12. The other dice represents minutes and is numbered at intervals of 5 from 5 to 60. The clock is made up of a central circular core (45) and twelve sector-shaped outer segments (22, 46). Various games can be played with the apparatus.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to apparatus for playing
games, especially but not exclusively, games relating to time.US-A-4489946 describes an apparatus for playing games
comprising a die and a planar object, with markings thereon,
the die having twelve facets, each facet having markings to
indicate numerals.The present invention in one aspect provides apparatus for
playing games according to claim 1.GB-A-2069218 describes apparatus for playing games
relating to time comprising a clock face.The present invention in another aspect provides apparatus
for playing games relating to time according to claim 4.The first die represents an "hour die" and its facets may
be marked 0 to 11 or 1 to 12. The second die represents a
"minute die" and its facets may marked 0 to 55, or 5 to 60 at
intervals of 5.The die may be formed of dodecahedron. They may have
pentagonal facets with straight edges between adjacent facets,
or they may have facets of other shapes, for example, circular,
with curved transitions between adjacent facets.The clock face may be made up of pieces which fit
together. It 
may include twelve sector pieces, each marked to indicate an hour 1
to 12. The clock face may include a central piece. The sector
pieces may include interlocking portions along their adjacent
radial edges, for example, tongue and groove. The sector pieces may
also include means for interlocking with the central piece. The
central piece may be circular.The clock may include an hour hand and a minute hand for
indicating the time. The hands may be attached to the central
circular piece.Alternatively the clock may be formed by a tray with clock
pieces that fit into the tray. The tray may have an outer wall and
an inner wall and the clock face pieces fit into the space between
the inner and outer walls.The apparatus may also include sets of numbered cards. Each
set may be distinct from the others, for example by being coloured
a different colour. In one embodiment there are six sets coloured,
for example, red, green, blue, yellow, brown and black. The cards
may be numbered in a binary progression. There may be 10 cards in
each set numbered 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256 and 512. These
cards are used to keep the score of each player. Any number from 1
to 1023 may be formed by combinations of these cards.In an alternative embodiment there are twleve 'hour' cards and
twelve 'minute' cards, each card being marked with a number
corresponding to a number on a facet of one of the dice. The
'hour' and 'minute' cards may also be marked with
