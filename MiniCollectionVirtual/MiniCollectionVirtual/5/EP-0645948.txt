<ABSTRACT>
Described are a process for soldering at least one component having 
solder bumps (12) to a substrate and a process for forming solder 

bumps (12) on metal pads (13) of 
an element, such as an IC package (10) or substrate (11) or both. The 

bumps (12) are formed by 
stencil printing solder paste deposits (21) on the metal pads (13), 

heating the solder paste 
deposits (21) to reflow temperature of the solder in the solder paste 

deposits (21), and allowing 
the molten solder in each deposit to coalesce and during subsequent 

cooling solidify 
forming the bumps (12) on the metal pads. The bumps are formed by 

conducting the 
stencil printing through apertures (20) in an ultra-thick stencil (19), 

the apertures (20) having 
trapezoidal crossection in the plane normal to the broad surfaces of 

the stencil with 
the top opening being smaller than the bottom opening and with the walls of the 

aperture sloping at an angle within a range of from 1 to 45 degrees from the 
vertical, 

the solder paste having a low tackiness and high metal loading, and the 
solder paste 

deposits (21) covering an area which is equal to or exceeds an area of 
the metal pad (13) in 

any ratio between 1.5:1 and 5:1. Bumps formed in this manner lead to the 
formation of reliable solder joints.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns surface mount solder assembly of leadless 
integrated circuit packages to substrates. In the evolution of electronic packaging many electronically operated 
devices include mounting boards having one or more of solder bumped packages, 
such as integrated circuit (IC) packages, surface mounted thereon. Each IC package 
may include one or more IC units, such as an IC chip or an IC module. While many 
interconnections are accomplished within the package, connections to the outside of 
the package, such as power, ground, signaling, etc., require numerous external I/Os 
between the package and the board. This is conveniently accomplished by means of 
leadless solder joints on the IC package. The term leadless solder joint means that 
there are no flexible conduction leads or rigid pins for establishing an electrically 
conductive path between contact pads on the flip side of the package and terminal 
pads on the board. The first objective of any leadless attachment technology, regardless of 
whether it is a perimeter or an area array, is to achieve the greatest possible 
interconnection height so as to minimize the effects of thermally driven fatigue 
(which might otherwise be accommodated by lead compliance in a leaded package). 
This need for solder joint height is generally interpreted as striving for the greatest 
possible solder bump/joint volume for a given pad area, pitch, etc. For this reason, 
relatively large solder preforms are used conventionally to assure solder volume. 
The large volume solder bumps are needed to maximize the IC package-to-board 
stand off (joint height as a direct means of minimizing the development of thermally 
induced shear strain in the resulting solder joints). See P. M. Hall et al., "Thermal 
Deformations Observed in Leadless Ceramic Chip Carriers Surface Mounted to 
Printed Wiring Boards", IEEE Transactions on Components, Hybrids and 
Manufacturing Technology, Vol. CHMT-6, No. 4, December 1983, pages 544-552. 
The thermal mismatch strains increase as the size and/or number of the IC packages 
increases. To understand the influence of component size on thermal strain 
magnitude and of the latter on the fatigue life of leadless interconnections see 
Microelectronics Package Handbook, Section 5-5, Thermal Mismatch and Thermal 
Fatigue, Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1989 edition, pages 277-320.  
 U.S. Patent 4,878,611 issued on November 7, 1989 to Francis LoVasco 
et al., describes a process for controlling solder joint geometry when surface 
mounting
