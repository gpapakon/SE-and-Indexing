<ABSTRACT>
In accordance with the present invention a 
novel wound dressing providing superior absorption 

and preventing leakage is disclosed. The present 
dressing comprises a hydrocolloid-containing 

polymeric support layer either continuous or non-continuous 
and an occlusive backing layer overlying 

the support. In a preferred embodiment the present 
dressing further includes an adhesive on a skin-contacting 

surface of the support and an absorbent 
region interposed between the support and the 

backing layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to new wound dressings that have a superior
ability to absorb wound fluid and prevent dressing leakage and wound maceration. The
dressings of the present invention are particularly adapted for application on wounds that
heavily exudate wound fluids during the healing process. There are numerous dressing
products in the art that are used in treating patient wounds in medical applications, however,
these products do not achieve the beneficial results of the present invention for these heavily
exudating wounds.Chen in U.S. Pat. No. 3,339,546 discloses an adhesive composition
comprising a blend of one or more water soluble or water swellable hydrocolloids and a
viscous substance such as polyisobutylene. The adhesive mass has a film of water insoluble
material affixed to one surface. Such a bandage is commercially available under the
trademark Stomahesive from Bristol Myers Squibb Company and is employed primarily as a
skin barrier by ostomates.Pawelchak et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 4,393,080 discloses adhesive compositions
for medical use comprising an homogeneous mixture of polyisobutylenes and one or more
natural or synthetic polymers, capable of developing elastomeric properties when hydrated,
such as gluten and long chain polymers of methyl vinyl ether/maleic acid. The composition 
may also include one or more water soluble hydrocolloid gums and may additionally contain
one or more water swellable cohesive strengthening agents. Additionally, one or more
thermoplastic elastomers such as styrene copolymers and small amounts of mineral oil may
he included within the composition.Pawelchak et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 4,538,603 discloses an occlusive dressing
comprising a first adhesive layer which contacts the skin and wound, a semi-open
cell elastic
foam layer, and a film overlying said foam layer. A second more aggressive adhesive layer
is interposed between said first adhesive and foam to more suitably accommodate the
difference in the adhesive requirements for the skin and the foam. This structure, based on a
fluid-interactive adhesive, provides an excellent wound dressing which has enjoyed much
commercial success in that the integrity of the structure is enhanced by the presence of the
second adhesive.The fluid-interactive adhesive of Pawelchak is one in which a considerable
portion of the fluids must be able to permeate through, or be absorbed into, the adhesive
while the adhesive still maintains enough "wet tack" to adhere to the wound and the
surrounding normal skin. As the

<CLAIMS>
A wound dressing comprising a non-continuous,
hydrocolloid-containing polymeric support layer (12, 33, 42, 45) and an

occlusive backing layer (11, 30, 40, 43) overlying said polymeric
support layer.
A skin-contacting baseplate for an ostomy or other
medical application wherein said baseplate comprises

a non-continuous, hydrocolloid-containing polymeric
support layer (12, 33, 42, 45) and, an occlusive layer (11, 30, 40, 43) overlying said

polymeric support.
The article of claim 1 or 2 wherein said polymeric
support layer is a web.
The article of claim 1 or 2 wherein said polymeric
support layer is a net.
The article of claim 1 or 2 wherein said polymeric
support layer is perforated.
The article of claim 1 or 2 wherein said article has
a wound contacting surface (15), said wound contacting

surface having an adhesive (34, 46) on at least a portion
thereof.
The article of claim 6 wherein said adhesive is
present on a peripheral portion of said wound

contacting surface.
The article of claim 1 or 2 wherein said occlusive
layer has a wound facing surface (13), said wound facing

surface being larger than said polymeric support layer
and wherein an adhesive is present at least on that

portion of the wound-facing surface of said occlusive
layer which extends beyond said polymeric support

layer.
The article of claim 1 or 2 wherein the occlusive
layer comprises a layer of fiber material with a layer

of film adhered to the surface of said fiber opposite
said polymeric support layer.
The article of claim 1 or 2 wherein said polymeric
support layer is comprised of a polyolefin.
The article of claim 1 or 2 wherein said polymeric
support layer is a water soluble polymer. 
The article of claim 1 or claim 2 wherein said
polymeric support layer is a polyvinylpyrrolidone.
The article of claim 1 wherein said polymeric support
layer is a polyvinyl alcohol.
The wound dressing of claim 1 wherein the support has
a wound contacting surface with an adhesive thereon and the

dressing further comprises an absorbent region (16, 31, 41, 44) overlying
said polymeric support, the occlusive layer overlying said

absorbent region.
The wound dressing of claim 1 wherein the polymeric
support layer is a blend of hydrocolloid and polymeric

material having a melting temperature of less than about
105Â°C.
The wound dressing of claim 1 wherein the polymeric
support layer has been coated with a hydrocolloid.
A skin contacting baseplate as claimed in claim 2
wherein the support layer has been coated with a

hydrocolloid.
A wound dressing as claimed in claim 2 wherein the
occlusive layer is a layer of polyurethane film, and the

dressing additionally comprises an absorbent region of a:

I) polymeric web;
II) a first layer of polypropylene fibres;
III) a mixture of hydrocolloids and superabsorbents;
IV) a second layer of polypropylene fibres;
