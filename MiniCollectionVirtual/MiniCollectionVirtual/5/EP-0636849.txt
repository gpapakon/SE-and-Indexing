<ABSTRACT>
An armour tile that can be used in an appliqué armour 
system and includes a generally flat ceramic component of 

relatively low tensile strength and an impedance match 
enhancing sheet component of greater tensile strength than 

the ceramic component is described. The sheet component 
overlies the major surface opposite the impact surface and 

the side surfaces of the ceramic component.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an armour tile for 
survivability enhancement. It is frequently desirable to enhance the survivability 
of various structures, including fixed and movable 
structures, and depending on particular applications, 
survivability enhancement structure may be placed on 
internal or external surfaces, or both, of the structure 
whose survivability it is desired to enhance. In particular applications, survivability enhancement 
structures are applied to external surfaces of a vehicle or 
other structure. Armoured vehicles, for example are 
designed to provide ballistic protection commensurate with 
a specific threat. In connection with such vehicles and 
other structures, the ability to readily vary the ballistic 
protection configuration or to quickly repair damaged armour 
as a function of particular threats to which the vehicle or 
other structure may be exposed may enhance survivability. 
Appliqué armour, that is, supplemental armour applied on top 
of the basic armour designed into the vehicle or other 
structure, has been proposed to enhance survivability. It 
has been proposed to attach such appliqué armour to the 
basic armour by adhesive bonding, by mechanical bolting, and 
by mechanical attachment. US Patent 4 928 575 describes a 
system employing separable fastener structure for attaching 
appliqué armour to basic armour. Such separable fastener structure arrangements have 
effective force dissipation characteristics and maintain 
attachment at effective levels even as the survivability 
enhancement structure is subjected to large shear forces 
(for example, upon ballistic impact and shattering of an 
adjacent tile or flexing of an armour sheet member). Such  
 
systems enable easy installation of auxiliary armour 
structure, as well as easy removal and reapplication to 
facilitate future armour revisions and upgrades. Easy 
replacement of damaged armour members in the field is 
possible. The structural integrity of the attachment system 
withstands normal system shocks, vibrations, brush loads, 
etc. However, the compliantly mounted ceramic armour tiles 
tend to require greater thicknesses (and accordingly, 
increased weight) to provide armour effectiveness comparable 
to rigidly mounted appliqué armour of the same material. US Patent No: 5 191 166, the disclosure of which is 
hereby incorporated by reference, describes an appliqué 
armour system that includes a plurality of ceramic armour 
tiles that have thin sheets of metal or polymer material 
that are adhered to

sheet component has a portion overlying and secured to said 
mounting surface, and side walls overlying and secured to 

respective said side surfaces.
