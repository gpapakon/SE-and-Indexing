<ABSTRACT>
Peptide derivatives serving as thrombin receptor antagonists are disclosed, which bear specificity for the cellular thrombin receptor without interfering with the catalytic activities of thrombin. The derivatives generally have formula (I) in which R1 and R3 are amide linkages, N-alkylamide linkages, or isosteric replacements of such linkages; R2 is either a neutral amino acid side chain or a hydrophobic radical; R4 is hydrophobic radical; R5 is CO, CH2 or SO; X is either of formula (II) in which R6 and R7 are H, alkyl, cycloalkylalkyl, alkoxyalkyl, alkylthioalkyl or arylalkyl, and R8 is a hydrophobic radical, or a hydrophobic residue; Y is alkoxy, hydroxy, amino, alkylamino, dialkylamino, in which any of the alkyl groups may be substituted with a basic moiety; Z is an amino acid or peptide residue; and m is zero or one.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to materials which modulate the action of thrombin on
cells of the vascular and circulating blood system. It is well known that thrombin has
multiple activities. Perhaps the most well known activity of this serine protease is to
convert fibrinogen to fibrin which clots blood. Additional functions of thrombin are
widespread and diverse and appear to involve cellular activations which are mediated
through cellular thrombin receptor(s). For example, thrombin is the most potent activator
of platelets; it is chemotactic for monocytes; it is mitogenic for lymphocytes and
mesenchymal cells including vascular smooth muscle cells and; it promotes numerous
responses within the vascular endothelium. See, Coughlin, et al., J. Clin. Invest. 89:351-355
(1992). Because these cell activating functions of thrombin occur within the range of
concentrations normally required for the clotting of blood, thrombin has been proposed to
play important physiological roles not only in hemostasis and thrombosis but may also
have principle roles in mediating responses to vascular injury such as leukocyte chemotaxis
to mediate inflammation, cellular proliferation to mediate restenosis, glomerulonephritis,
and wound repair such as occurs in bone remodeling.The role of thrombin in acute thrombosis has been clearly established. For
a review, see, Chesbro et al., Thromb. Haemostas., 66:1-5 (1991). However, thrombin's
role in thrombosis is not limited to its blood clotting activity but also extends to platelet
aggregation as thrombin appears to be the principle physiological mediator of platelet
aggregate formation at sites of vascular injury resulting from the activation of the platelet
thrombin receptor. Recent antithrombotic approaches inhibit or modulate the enzymatic
activity of thrombin and include compounds such as heparin, low molecular weight
heparins, PPACK, hirudins, argatroban, and the hirulogs. All of these agents inhibit the
catalytic activity of the enzyme. Therefore, these agents not only inhibit the pro- and
anticoagulant actions of thrombin but also the cell activating functions of thrombin as well.
Accordingly, none of these agents are useful for specifically inhibiting the cellular actions
of thrombin. No agent which specifically targets the thrombin receptor has been clinically
developed. Previous attempts to identify a thrombin receptor inhibitor have been thwarted
by the inability of researchers, until very recently, to identify the physiologically relevant
and functional thrombin
