<ABSTRACT>
A crawler block rubber pad for a crawler (10) which has an 
endless path of movement and which is used for a vehicle. 

Links (1) are axially supported and connected by pins (6) in 
an endless shape, and crawler blocks (2) are attached to 

outer surfaces of the links. In the crawler block rubber pad, 
a rubber pad (3) is formed integrally, by vulcanization and 

adhesion, to an outer side surface of a crawler block and to 
end portions of the crawler block as seen from a longitudinal 

direction of the links. Preferably, the rubber pad is 
vulcanized and adhered to both end portions of the crawler 

block in the longitudinal direction of the links. 
Even if a small stone or the like becomes caught in a space 
between crawler blocks which space widens when the crawler is 

trained around an idler of the like, because a thickness of 
rubber material is provided so as to be larger than a radius 

of a small stone, no unwanted force is applied to the pins 
and the links.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a rubber pad of crawler block for a crawler.
Furthermore the invention relates to a crawler comprising links
connected together by connecting members to form an endless
shape such that the links can be assembled onto a drive
mechanism of a machine
such as a machine used for construction, a machine used for
civil engineering or the like.When machines for construction or machines for civil
engineering work travel on paved roads, the paved surface
may be damaged. As a result, crawler blocks having rubber
pads on the outer surfaces thereof have come into use in
place of steel crawler blocks.Fig. 23 is a side view of a conventional crawler using
crawler blocks having rubber pads. Fig. 24 is a side view
of the crawler trained around a sprocket or an idler.In the drawings, 10 is a link, 20 is a crawler block,
and 30 is a rubber pad vulcanized and adhered to the outer
surface of the crawler block 20. The links 10 and the
crawler block 20 are fixed by bolts 40 and nuts 50.
Adjacent links 10, 10 are axially supported by pins 60. The
crawler is trained around unillustrated track rollers or
sprockets or around idlers 70 which contact the upper 
surfaces of the links 10 so that the crawler rotates and
travels.Further, when the crawler is trained around a sprocket
or the idler 70, as illustrated in Fig. 23, the line
connecting the pins 60, 60 of the crawler becomes a neutral
line. The crawler rotates with the portions thereof at the
inner side of this line narrowing, while the portions
thereof at the outer peripheral side of the line widen.When the crawler is trained around the idler 70 or the
like, the spaces (W0) between outer peripheral sides of
adjacent crawler blocks 20, 20 become very large.
Therefore, small stones, pieces of ore or the like may
become caught in the spaces such that damage to the crawler
blocks 20 and the rubber pads 30 is unavoidable.Further, crawler rubber shoes in which rubber is
vulcanized and adhered to the ground-contacting surface
thereof have by preference come into use. Fig. 25 is a
ground-contacting surface side plan view illustrating an
example of a crawler rubber shoe. Fig. 26 is a side view
thereof, and Fig. 27 is a cross sectional view taken along
line N-N of Fig. 25.In the conventional crawler rubber shoe, a metal
crawler block 54 is attached by bolts 52 and nuts 53 to
connection links 51 which form the crawler. Usually a
grouser 55 is formed at the ground-contacting surface side 
of the metal crawler block 54, i.e., at the outer surface
side of

<CLAIMS>
A rubber pad (13, 23, 33) of a crawler block (12, 22, 32)
for a crawler having an inner pad surface vulcanized and

adhered to outer side surfaces of said crawler block (12,
22, 32) and to inner side end surfaces thereof, a
