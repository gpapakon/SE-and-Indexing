<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an aqueous crosslinkable coating 
composition containing a certain carboxyl-functional copolymer derived from 
the polymerisation of two or more olefinically unsaturated monomers. The provision of polymeric coatings on a variety of substrates, 
e.g. for protective, decorative, adhesive or sealant purposes, is a well 
established field of technology. It is well known to improve the 
performance of such coatings by causing them to become crosslinked (cured) 
during and/or after coating formation from the composition and various 
crosslinkable aqueous polymer compositions for achieving such an objective 
have been used or proposed. One such type of crosslinkable composition incorporates an aqueous 
dispersion of a carboxyl-functional polymer made from two or more 
olefinically unsaturated monomers, such a composition including a carboxyl-reactive 
material that will effect a crosslinking reaction involving the 
carboxyl groups of the polymer and the material during and/or after film 
formation. For example aqueous crosslinkable compositions which include 
carboxyl-functional polymers and polyepoxy compounds or certain multivalent 
metal compounds have been proposed, in which crosslinking occurs 
respectively by reaction of the carboxyl groups with epoxide groups of the 
polyepoxy compound or by the carboxyl groups taking part in ionic 
crosslinking with metal ions from the metal compound. Also proposed have 
been aqueous crosslinkable compositions which include carboxyl-functional 
polymers and polymers having hydroxyl groups wherein crosslinking occurs by 
an esterification reaction involving the carboxyl and hydroxyl groups. The source of the carboxyl groups in the polymers of such 
crosslinkable compositions has hitherto been widely-used α-β olefinically 
unsaturated acids such as, in particular, acrylic acid, methacrylic acid and 
(sometimes) itaconic acid, the acid(s) being used as one of the monomers in 
the polymerisation so as to provide polymerised units thereof in the 
copolymer. We have now discovered that by selecting certain olefinically 
unsaturated carboxylic acid-containing monomers as the source of at least 
part of the carboxyl group content of the polymer a coating composition of 
significantly improved performance is unexpectedly achieved.  
 According to be present invention there is provided an aqueous 
crosslinkable coating composition comprising an aqueous dispersion of: 
(A) at least one copolymer, said copolymer being obtainable or derived 
from
