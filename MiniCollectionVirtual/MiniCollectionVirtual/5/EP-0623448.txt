<ABSTRACT>
A molding process for producing molded articles by 
extrusion blow molding, thermoforming or injection 

molding, which continually replicates the mold cavity 
surface comprises heating the mold cavity surface to a 

temperature below the softening temperature of the 
thermoplastic resin, bringing the thermoplastic resin 

into contact with the mold cavity surface while venting 
the air therebetween, heating the mold cavity surface to 

a temperature that peaks above the softening temperature 
of the thermoplastic resin, cooling the mold cavity 

surface from the peak temperature to a temperature below 
the softening temperature of the thermoplastic resin, 

continuing cooling until the molded article is 
sufficiently rigid for removal from the mold, and then 

removing the molded article from the mold.

<DESCRIPTION>
An improved process for producing a thermoplastic 
article, the surface of which replicates or 
reproduces the surface configuration of the mold, 
including a gloss having a Class A surface and, at 
cycle times, less than currently disclosed processes 
for replicating of mold cavity surfaces. In 
addition, imperfections displayed in the surface 
of the plastic parts, such as splay, die lines, or 
pits, are greatly reduced or even eliminated. A 
Class A surface has been defined in many different 
ways with no universal definition. One accepted 
definition is a glossy, smooth and polished surface 
which should be as smooth as that of a current 
automobile exterior part made from sheet metal. 
Another definition is that the visible surface of 
the article in the finished state is free of 
exposed glass fibers, flash, sharp edges, visible 
parting lines, crazing, porosity, hair line cracks, 
blisters, and obvious repairs, including pits or 
other imperfections in the surface. In the present 
invention, another way of determining a Class A 
surface is based on employing a Gloss Reflectometer 
and ranking the samples, as described in the 
Examples of this invention.  The improved process of this invention involves 
controlling the surface temperature of the mold 
surface during the molding cycle. The improved 
process of this invention is applicable to extrusion 
blow molding, injection molding or thermoforming 
either by vacuum or pressure thermoforming. 
The process briefly involves heating the temperature 
of the surface of the mold against which the 
thermoplastic resin is to be brought into contact 
to a temperature below which the surface of the 
thermoplastic resin is softened under the temperature 
and pressure of the molding conditions; 
heating the mold surface to a temperature that 
peaks above said softening temperature; cooling 
said mold surface temperature from the peak 
temperature to a temperature below said softening 
temperature of the surface of the thermoplastic 
molded article; continuing cooling of said mold 
surface until the molded article is sufficiently 
rigid for removal of said molded article from the 
mold; and then removing the molded article from 
the mold. There is considerable art in the thermoplastic 
molding technology arena with respect to such molding 
processes as blow molding, thermoforming and 
injection molding. The replication or reproduction 
of the mold surface is an important critical 
feature of most, if not all, molding processes and 
techniques. For surface
