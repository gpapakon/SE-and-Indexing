<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a contact system for current limiting units which are combined with power circuit breakers (power switches) or motor protective circuit breakers. The problem to be solved is to improve the reliability of a current limiting unit which is fitted with such a contact system while reducing the assembly cost (installation cost) for said contact system. To this end, the contact systems consist of a contact carrier with a stationary contact piece and a partial system (24) which can be preinstalled using small amounts of force and can be installed in the switching chambers in a condition which is stable and is subject to the action of the force of contact pressure springs (72). The partial system contains the contact arm (34) which is provided with the moving contact piece (28) and is mounted on a connecting conductor (36), with a direct electrical connection. Supporting points in the partial system (24) limit the movement of the contact arm in both directions. A retaining block (58), which is provided with a retaining groove (64) and an auxiliary groove (62), in order to hold those parts which are connected to the contact pressure springs in a force-fitting manner, makes preliminary assembly of the partial system possible via an intermediate condition, which is likewise stable.

Contact system for a current-limiting unit with moulded casing, consisting of 

a movable contact wiper (34) including a movable contact piece (28) located 
at one end and a swivelling axle (44) located at the other end; 
a connecting attachment (36) which is to be connected with the contact wiper 
(34), and which presents a transition into a first power terminal (30); 
a fixed contact carrier (22) including a fixed contact piece (26) located at one 
end, and a second power terminal (32) located at the other end, preferably 

presenting a partial section with a current direction running opposite with 
regard to the contact wiper (34); and 
consisting, in addition to this, of contact pressure springs (72), fixed at the 
contact wiper (34) by one of their ends, 
wherein
the connecting attachment (36) presents a transition to and forms a single 
element with a bearing point (46) which supports the swivelling axle (44) in a 

bearing and which forms a conducting connection brought about to the 
contact wiper (34) by surface pressure forces; 
the contact pressure springs (72) are fixed at the connecting attachment (36) 
by means of their other end; 
the contact wiper (34) rests upon the connecting attachment (36) by means 
of a first supporting point (74, 76) and in the direction of the force exerted by 

the contact pressure springs (72) after having passed the complete lift-up; 
the contact wiper (34) rests upon the connecting attachment (36) by means 
of a second supporting point (78, 80) and against the direction of the force 

exerted by the contact pressure springs (72) when having reached the 
maximum angle of aperture;  

 
the contact pressure springs (72) can be fixed at the connecting 
attachment(36) by means of their other end in such a way that the force, 

acting during the process of assembly, is smaller than the force which acts in 
the final assembled condition. 
Contact system as claimed in claim 1, 
wherein
helical contact pressure springs (72) are arranged and subjected to tension 
by both sides of the contact wiper (34), and apply to two retention pins (68; 

70) that are arranged in transverse direction with regard to the application of 
the force, while the first retention pin (68) is fixed at the contact wiper (34), 

and while the plane formed by the points of application of the contact 
pressure springs (72) is located between the contact carrier (22) and the 

swivelling axis (44); 
a retention block (58) is made of insulating material, fixed at the connecting 
attachment (36) at least by non-positive fit under the action of the force 

exerted by the contact pressure springs (72), and presents a retention 

groove (64) that serves for the non-positive final fixing of the second 
retention pin (70); 
the retention block (58) provides an auxiliary groove (62) for the non-positive 
intermediate fixing of the second retention pin (70), while the auxiliary groove 

(62) is located in front of the retention groove (64) with regard to the contact 
carrier (22) and is connected with this retention groove (64) by means of an 

inclination (66). 
Contact system as claimed in claims 1 or 2, 
wherein
 the contact wiper (34) 
consists of contact wiper strips (42) which are in a laterally reversed position 

with regard to one another and which embrace the bearing point (46) from both 
sides, while they are kept at a distance with regard to one another.  

 
Contact system as claimed in one of the above-mentioned claims, 
wherein
 a 
surface pressure spring (51) is fixed at the swivelling axle (44) for surface 

pressure. 
Contact system as claimed in one of the claims 2 through 4, 
wherein
 the 
connecting attachment (36) presents a transition to and forms a single element 

with a prismatic retention web (56) which is turned away from the movable 
contact piece (28) and on which retention web (56) the retention block (58) rests 

by means of a corresponding prismatic form (60). 
Contact system as claimed in one of the above-mentioned claims, 
wherein
 the 
first supporting point (74, 76) is located essentially between the swivelling axle 

(44) and the points of application of the contact pressure springs (72) fixed at 
the end. 
Contact system as claimed in claims 3 and 6, 
wherein
 the first supporting point 
(74, 76) consists of the steps (74) formed at both sides of the connecting 

attachment (36), and of front-side supporting surfaces (76) which belong to the 
contact wiper strips (42) and can rest against these steps (74). 
Contact system as claimed in claims 5 and 7, 
wherein
 the steps (74) are formed 
by the transition of the bearing point (46) into the retention web (56) that is 

thicker by comparison with this bearing point (46). 
Contact system as claimed in one of the above-mentioned claims, 
wherein
 the 
second supporting point (78, 80) consists of a stop surface (78) which is 

inclined in accordance with the maximum angle of aperture of the contact 
system (12), and which is formed at the front side at a stop web (82) that  

 
projects from and forms a single element with the connecting attachment (36), 

and of surface parts (80) which can rest upon the stop web, which belong to the 
contact wiper (34) and which are turned away from the movable contact piece 

(28). 
Contact system as claimed in one of the claims 2 through 9, 
wherein
