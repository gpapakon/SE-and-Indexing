<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to safety device for a cylinder 
valve automatic switching unit, wherein said valve is 

automatically closed when some abnormality such as down 
of an air pressure takes place. 
A first air-operated selector valve 8 is installed which 
causes air flowing out of a reservoir tank 10 to flow 

into a second supply line 3 when air pressure is reduced, 
whereby a cylinder valve automatic switching unit 1 in 

the opening situation is caused to make a closing motion 
for closing a cylinder valve in the opened situation. 

And, a second air-operated selector valve 9 is further 
installed which discharges air flowing out of a first 

supply line 2 to the atmosphere when the air pressure is 
reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a safety device for a
cylinder valve automatic switching unit which causes a
cylinder valve automatic switching unit (a double-acting,
air operated rotary actuator) in the open position to
make a closing motion, thereby preventing any danger.An automatic switching unit for a cylinder valve
according to the prior art is disclosed on Fig. 4. On
this figure, a cylinder valve automatic unit 1 is able to
make an opening or closing motion, with the flowing-in of
air which is being fed thereto from a driving air
pressure source 4 by way of an electromagnetic selector
valve 5, thereby opening or closing a cylinder valve (not
shown).The aforementioned cylinder valve automatic switching
unit 1 is constructed in the form of a cylinder closed in
top and bottom sides, and on a portion of the inner
peripheral wall thereof, a control plate la is projected
in the vertical direction, which is directed to the
center. On a portion of the peripheral wall of the cylinder valve
automatic switching unit 1, there are a first port 1b and
a second port 1c bored so as to be projectedly juxtaposed
which are of through holes. The aforementioned control
plate la is mounted as it is hidden, between these first
port 1b and second port 1c.To the first port 1b is connected a first supply line 2
which makes a supplying operation, and to the second port
1c is also connected a second supply line 3 which makes
the same supplying operation. These first supply line 2
and second supply line 3 are connected to the driving air
pressure source 4 by way of the electromagnetic selector
valve 5.On the other hand, a turnable rotary shaft 1d is provided
running vertically at the center of the inside of the
cylinder valve automatic switching unit 1. To the bottom
portion of the rotary shaft ld which is hanging downward
and outward is connected a cylinder valve (not shown)
which stores a gas. A vane plate (vane) le which is in
contact with the control plate la is attached as one body
on the rotary shaft 1d.This vane plate le rotates counterclockwise 270 degrees
for opening when air is permitted to flow from the first
port 1b to the inside of the cylinder valve automatic
switching unit 1, whereby air between the control plate 
1a and the vane plate 1e is discharged from the second
port 1c to the second supply line 3 and the rotary shaft
1d is rotated in the same direction to open the cylinder
valve (see : an arrowmark in Fig.4).The same vane plate 1e functions reversely to rotate
clockwise 270 degrees for closing when air

<CLAIMS>
A safety device for a cylinder valve automatic switching unit, which
comprises :


a cylinder valve automatic switching unit (1) for opening or closing a
cylinder valve;
a first conduit means (2), through which a fluid from a fluid supply

source (4) is caused to flow into a first fluid port (1b) of said cylinder valve
automatic switching unit (1), thereby causing the same cylinder valve automatic

switching unit (1) to make an opening motion;
a second conduit means (3), through which the fluid from the fluid
supply source (4) is caused to flow into a second fluid port (1c) of said cylinder

valve automatic switching unit (1) to make a closing motion;
a first selector valve (5) for flowing the fluid from the fluid supply source
(4) selectively to the first conduit means (2) or second conduit means (3), and

for discharging the fluid led to the second conduit means or first conduit means
to the atmosphere;
a second selector valve (8) for permitting on normal operation the flow
of the fluid between the second conduit means (3) and the first selector valve

(5) on the basis of the fluid pressure coming from the fluid supply source (4),
and for causing the fluid flowing out of a storage means (10), to flow into the

second fluid port (1c) when the fluid pressure is reduced, whereby the cylinder
valve automatic switching unit (1) in the opening situation is caused to make a

closing motion; and
a third selector valve (9) for permitting on normal operation the flow of
the fluid between the first conduit means (2) and the first selector valve (5) on 

the basis of the fluid pressure coming from the fluid supply source (4), and for
discharging the fluid flowing out of the first fluid port (1b) to the atmosphere

when the fluid pressure is reduced.
