<ABSTRACT>
A liquid crystal device is constituted by a 
pair of substrates respectively having thereon a 

plurality of scanning lines and a plurality of data 
lines intersecting the scanning lines, and a liquid 

crystal disposed between the substrates so as to form 
a matrix of pixels each at an intersection of the 

scanning lines and the data lines. The liquid crystal 
device is driven under conditions that (1) the 

scanning lines are sequentially selected so that every 
N-th scanning line is selected in a field, (2) N is an 

odd number, (3) a period for selecting each scanning 
line is changed depending on an environmental 

temperature at which the device is placed, and (4) N 
is changed depending on the environmental temperature. 

As a result, a uniformly good image is displayed 
regardless of a temperature change and with minimum 

flicker liable to occur depending on a repetitive 
display pattern.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid 
crystal apparatus, such as a display panel or a 
shutter-array printer, using a liquid crystal, 
particularly a chiral smectic liquid crystal. Hitherto, there has been well-known a type of 
liquid crystal display devices which comprises a group 
of scanning electrodes and a group of signal or data 
electrodes arranged in a matrix, and a liquid crystal 
compound is filled between the electrode groups to 
form a large number of pixels thereby to display 
images or information. These display devices are driven by a multiplexing 
driving method wherein an address signal is 
selectively applied sequentially and periodically to 
the group of scanning electrodes, and prescribed data 
signals are parallelly and selectively applied to the 
group of data electrodes in synchronism with the 
address signals. In most of the practical devices of the type 
described above, TN (twisted nematic)-type liquid 
crystals have been used as described in "Voltage-Dependent 
Optical Activity of a Twisted Nematic Liquid 
Crystal" by M. Schadt and W. Helfrich, Applied Physics 
Letters, Vol. 18, No. 4, pp. 127 - 128.  
 In recent years, the use of a liquid crystal 
device showing bistability has been proposed by Clark 
and Lagerwall as an improvement to the conventional 
liquid crystal devices in U.S. Patent No. 4,367,924; 
JP-A (Kokai) 56-107216; etc. As the bistable liquid 
crystal, a ferroelectric liquid crystal (hereinafter 
sometimes abbreviated as "FLC") showing chiral smectic 
C phase (SmC*) or H phase (SmH*) is generally used. 
The ferroelectric liquid crystal assumes either a 
first optically stable state or a second optically 
stable state in response to an electric field applied 
thereto and retains the resultant state in the absence 
of an electric field, thus showing a bistability. 
Further, the ferroelectric liquid crystal quickly 
responds to a change in electric field, and thus the 
ferroelectric liquid crystal device is expected to be 
widely used in the field of a high-speed and memory-type 
display apparatus, etc. However, the above-mentioned ferroelectric 
liquid crystal device has involved a problem of 
flickering at the time of multiplex driving. For 
example, European Laid-Open Patent Application (EP-A) 
149899 discloses a multiplex driving method comprising 
applying a scanning selection signal of an AC voltage 
the polarity of which is reversed (or the signal phase 
of which is reversed) for each frame to selectively 
write a "white" state (in combination with
