<ABSTRACT>
In a control device for a motor-vehicle lock, with a control pin which is movable in two directions of rotation and which, depending on the direction of rotation, cooperates with pivotably mounted levers, by means of which the operating states of the lock can be set, and with switching means for emitting a signal characteristic of the prevailing operating state, the control pin is assigned a switching cam which describes an arc of a circle having an arc length corresponding to the angle of rotation of the control pin between two operating states. The switching cam actuates a switch with two switching positions, and the signal change when the switch goes from one switching position to the other can be evaluated. It is thereby possible to set four different states by means of only one switch and a predetermination of the direction of rotation.

<CLAIMS>
A control device for a lock on motor vehicles, comprising a control spigot
movable in two directions of rotation and switching means for delivering a signal

characterising the current functional state, characterised in that the control
spigot, depending on the direction of rotation, cooperates with pivotably

mounted levers for adjusting the functional states of the lock; the control spigot
(1) is associated with a trip cam (7) which describes an arc having a length

corresponding to the angle of rotation by the control spigot (1) between two
functional states; the trip cam (7) actuates a switch (8) having two positions;

and when the direction of rotation of the trip cam (7) is preset, the change of
signal after the switch moves from one position to the other can be evaluated.
A control device according to claim 1, characterised in that the trip cam (7)
describes an arc of approximately 180Â°.
