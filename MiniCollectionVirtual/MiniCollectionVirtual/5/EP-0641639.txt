<ABSTRACT>
The invention comprises multi-layered plastics composites and a method for their production from at least two incompatible plastics A and B with good adherence between layers, the sequence of layers alternating between A and B, the layers of plastic B being interrupted at regular intervals and the gaps in the layers being filled with plastic A. In preferred embodiments of the invention, the amorphous, crystalline or semi-crystalline plastic B has a higher coefficient of thermal expansion than the amorphous plastic A. The plastics composite is preferably produced by coextrusion.

<CLAIMS>
A multi-layered plastic laminate of at least two
thermoplastic materials (A) and (B), wherein the

layer sequence alternates between (A) and (B), the
layers of material (B) being interrupted at regular

intervals and the gaps in the layers (B) being
filled with material (A), characterised in that the

materials (A) and (B) are incompatible.
A multi-layered plastic laminate according to claim
1, characterised in that the layers of material (B)

are embedded in material (A) as unidirectional
strands.
A multi-layered plastic laminate according to
claims 1 and 2, characterised in that the material

(B) has a larger thermal expansion coefficient than
material (A).
A multi-layered plastic laminate according to
claims 1 to 3, characterised in that material (A)

is amorphous and that material (B) is amorphous,
partially crystalline or crystalline.
A multi-layered plastic laminate according to
claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the cross-sections

of the laminated segments of material (B)
change periodically.
A process for preparing multi-layered plastic
laminates according to claims 1 to 5, characterised

in that the laminated structure is prepared by coextrusion.
