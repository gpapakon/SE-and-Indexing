<ABSTRACT>
Method and apparatus for providing a gas seal in a CFB reactor, which is provided with a vertical, slot-shaped return duct (16), and for regulating the flow of circulating mass therein. The gas seal (22) is formed by arranging barrier means (22, 24, 26) on two different levels in the regulation zone of the return duct to slow down the flow of the circulating mass through the regulation zone. The flow of the circulating mass through the regulation zone is regulated by injecting fluidizing gas (56, 58, 60) into the regulation zone.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus 
for providing a gas seal in a return duct and/or controlling 
the circulating mass flow in a circulating fluidized 
bed reactor, which is provided with a slot-shaped, vertical 
return duct defined by two, mainly vertical plane 
wall panels and ends joining these. Circulating fluidized bed reactors are used, to an ever 
increasing extent, for combusting and gasifying various 
fuels, and as reactors in diverse chemical processes. 
They provide efficient mixing of gaseous and solid particles, 
which results in a uniform temperature of the 
process and faultless process control. In circulating 
fluidized bed reactors, the gas flow rate is maintained 
so high in the reaction or combustion chamber that a 
considerable portion of the bed material, entrained with 
the gases, flows out of the chamber. The major part of 
this solid material, i.e. the circulating mass, is separated 
from the gases in a particle separator connected 
with the chamber and is returned to the lower section of 
the combustion chamber via a return duct. In circulating fluidized bed reactors such as PYROFLOW 
boilers, cyclone separators are used for separating circulating 
bed material from the gas. The circulating 
material is in this case returned via a return duct from 
the lower section of the cyclone to the lower section of 
the combustion chamber. The lower part of the return duct 
is provided with a member which serves as a gas seal preventing 
the gas from flowing via the return duct to the 
separator.  
 Fuel feed in the circulating fluidized bed reactors is 
often arranged in the return duct, where the fuel efficiently 
mixes with the circulating mass. The fuels generally 
contain some volatile substances which are separated 
from the solid fuel already in the return duct. 
Therefore, the fuel feed has to be arranged in the return 
duct below the loop seal so that these volatile substances 
are introduced into the combustion chamber thereby 
not causing any trouble, which would be the case if 
they flowed upwardly in the return duct. Heat recovery from the circulating mass is awkward to 
arrange in a conventional loop seal construction. For 
regulating the circulating mass temperature in the return 
duct, the return duct is equipped with a separate heat 
exchanger, e.g., such as is provided with a fluidized 
bed. However, such an arrangement takes a lot of space, 
it is complicated and, naturally expensive. In circulating fluidized bed boilers, heat is generally 
recovered
