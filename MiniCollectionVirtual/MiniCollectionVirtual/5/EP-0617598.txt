<ABSTRACT>
A prosthetic, resorbable articular cartilage (10) and methods of its fabrication and insertion are disclosed. The prosthetic articular cartilage (10), when implanted in a humanoid joint, acts as a resorbable scaffold for ingrowth of native articular chondrocytes and supports natural articulating joint forces. The prosthetic articular cartilage (10) is a dry, porous, volume matrix of biocompatible and bioresorbable fibers (12). These fibers include a natural polymer or analogs thereof, at least a portion of which may be crosslinked. The matrix (12) is adapted to have an in vivo outer surface contour substantially the same as that of natural articular cartilage in an articulating joint, and has a pore size in the approximate range of about 100 microns to about 400 microns.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PROSTHETIC ARTICULAR CARTILAGEBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to implantable medical devices. More particularly, this invention is directed to medical devices useful as prosthetic articular cartilage and in vivo scaffolds for regeneration of articular cartilagenous tissue, and to methods for fabricating such devices.Articular cartilage covers the ends of all bones that form articulating joints in humans and animals. The cartilage acts in the joint as a mechanism for force distribution and as a lubricant in the area of contact between the bones. Without articular cartilage, stress concentration and friction would occur to the degree that the joint would not permit ease of motion. Loss of the articular cartilage usually leads to painful arthritis and decreased joint motion. 
It is known that chondrocytes, the cells that produce articular cartilage, have the ability to migrate into a defect filled with a fibrin clot and form tissue substantially similar to natural cartilage (Arnoczky et al. (1985) Arthroscopy .1:247). Additionally, it has been shown that chondrocytes in tissue culture are capable of cell division and matrix synthesis (Webber et al. (1985) J. Ortho. Res. 3(1) :36) . However, the amount of cartilage formed by these procedures is generally not adequate to replace severely damaged joint surfaces in vivo.Prior art treatment of injured or diseased cartilage has generally been both by attempts, at surgical repair, replacement, or by excision. With repair or excision, regeneration of tissue may occur, although the tissue is usually temporary and inadequate to withstand the normal joint forces.Replacement of articular cartilage usually has been by allografting (Sengupta et al. (1974) _______Bone SurÏƒ. 56B(1) .-167-177; Rodrigo et al. (1978) Clin. OrthOp. 134:342-349) by periosteal grafts (see, e.g., Engkvist (1979) Scan. J. Plast. Reconstr. Surer. 13_:361-369; Rubak (1982) Acta Orthop. Scan. j53_:181-186) or with metal and/or plastic components (Rubash et al., eds. (1991) Clin. Orth. Rel. Res. 271:2-96) . Allografting dead cartilage tissue has been tried for years with minimal success. This approach has been only partially successful over the long term due to the host's immunologic response to the graft, failures in the cryopreservation process, and failures of the attachment sites. Replacement of 

 an entire joint surface with metal and plastic components has met excellent success for the older, more sedentary patients, but is generally considered insufficient for
