<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus and methods for a system and process for 
applying a flux coating to a circuit board by pulsing an 

airless spray gun on and off to achieve excellent circuit 
board through-hole penetration and uniform film 

thickness. An overspray collection system is provided 
which reduces overspray and increases material 

utilization and transfer efficiency. A gun positioning 
mechanism, which can be automated, accurately locates the 

gun relative to the circuit board.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of fabricating 
printed circuit boards and more particularly to an 
apparatus and method for applying soldering flux to the 
circuit boards with an airless spray gun prior to 
soldering leads of electrical components to the board. The production of circuit boards typically 
includes loading the boards onto a conveyor system and 
transferring them down a conveyor line where the leads of 
electrical components are inserted into the holes through 
the circuit board by a machine and/or manually. The 
boards are then transferred to an edge handling conveyor 
which transfers the boards through a flux station where 
solder flux is applied to the circuit boards so that the 
leads of the electrical components can later be soldered 
to the metallized areas of the board with a high quality 
solder bond. After the flux application station, the  
 
boards are transferred through a preheat zone to flash 
off the solvents from the flux and to preheat the board 
to minimize thermal shock from contact with solder wave. 
Continuing the process, the board is transported through 
a wave solder machine where the board moves over a wave 
of solder. The solder is drawn or forced up into 
through-holes containing the leads of the electrical 
components and solder bonds between the leads and the 
metallized sections of the board are formed. After 
leaving the wave solder machine, the board is sent 
through a cleaning machine to remove the residue left 
from the flux. The effectiveness of the flux 
application, the type of flux being applied, the need to 
clean the board subsequent to soldering, and the need to 
clean the coating chamber in which the solder flux is 
applied, each present problems which are addressed by the 
present invention. Presently, three types of flux, i.e. rosin flux, 
organic acid flux, and low solids flux, are being used in 
the manufacture of circuit boards. Rosin flux and 
organic acid flux are the most prevalently used fluxes at 
this time. These two fluxes are normally applied by 
contacting the circuit board with either a liquid wave or 
a foam of flux, the latter being obtained by bubbling a 
gas through a flux which is made to foam. Alternatively, 
the flux can be applied to the circuit board by brushing 
or spraying. In both the liquid wave and foam 
application systems, an open vat or barrel containing the 
flux must be constantly monitored to keep the percent of 
solid to solvent within a range of predefined levels 
since solvents evaporate out of fluxes. The
