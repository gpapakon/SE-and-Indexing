<ABSTRACT>
A body-implantable lead (10) for use in cardiac 
pacing having a proximal end and a distal end, the 

proximal end being adapted to be connected to a medical 
device, a tissue securing means such as a helix (40) 

extending from the lead body distal end, an electrical 
conductor extending between the proximal and distal ends 

of the lead, and a longitudinally extending radiopaque 
marker (35) affixed to the lead body (10) proximal to 

the tissue securing means, the radiopaque marker (35) 
showing rotational movement or distortion of the 

radiopaque marker (35) under fluoroscopy.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a lead bearing an 
electrode for electrically connecting an organ inside a 
living animal body to an electrical device and is 
particularly, though not exclusively, applicable to 
cardiac pacing leads. There are generally two types of body-implantable 
leads used with cardiac pacemakers, myocardial and 
endocardial. Myocardial leads presently require surgery 
to expose the myocardial tissue to which the electrode 
is affixed. Endocardial leads have an electrode or electrodes 
located at the distal end, are inserted in and guided 
through a body vessel such as a vein into the heart 
where the electrodes contact, and in some cases, are 
secured to the heart through the endothelial tissue 
lining the heart interior. Endocardial leads are 
divided into active and passive fixation leads. Passive 
fixation leads are nonpenetrating leads. Tined leads 
are an example of passive fixation leads. Active 
fixation leads are penetrating leads. Applicant's fixed 
screw lead is an example of an active fixation lead. An important feature of an endocardial lead is that 
of having a means of securing the electrode to the heart 
without dislodgment. Active fixation leads reduce 
dislodgments. A disadvantage of prior art leads is that 
it is difficult to know when the lead has been 
successfully embedded in the cardiac tissue. With a 
fixed screw lead it is difficult to judge how many turns 
are necessary to embed or remove the helix without 
turning the lead too many times thereby causing undue 
trauma to the tissue. With such leads, the physician 
must tactually determine the number of rotations 
necessary to achieve lead fixation. Endocardial screw-in type leads are well known in  
 
the art as for example, U.S. Patent No. 4,146,036 to 
Dutcher et al which discloses a unipolar fixed screw 
lead. With such leads, the physician tactually 
determines the number of rotations necessary to achieve 
lead fixation. U.S. Patent No. 4,570,642 to Kane et al discloses 
an endocardial, unipolar, extendable screw-in lead. 
With such leads, the physician observes helix extension 
under fluoroscopy during lead fixation. U.S. Patent No. 3,974,834 to Kane et al discloses 
an endocardial, bipolar, screw-in lead. With such 
leads, the physician tactually determines the number of 
rotations necessary to achieve lead fixation. U.S. Patent No. 4,046,151 to Rose discloses an 
endocardial, bipolar, screw-in lead. With such leads, 
the physician tactually determines the number of 
rotations necessary to achieve
