<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a central buffer coupling for rail vehicles with a closure with rotatable disk hooks and a coupled coupling eyelet (2), in which the coupling eyelet (2) is located retracted in the interior of the centring projection (3) when the coupling is not in use, and the coupling head is provided on the funnel side with a guide mouth (9). The exact axial alignment between two central buffer couplings of two rail vehicles travelling towards one another is virtually impossible during operational use before the said couplings engage one in the other. The cause of this is on the one hand the tracks and on the other hand the parameters of the vehicles. Vertical and lateral offset, but also angular offset, therefore have to be compensated before the coupling process. A central buffer coupling according to the invention is characterised by means of a novel design of the guide mouth (9) as a guide on the funnel side and the arrangement of an oblique guiding surface as a further guide on the protruding centring projection (3) for vertical precentring. As a result, in comparison with central buffer couplings without a guide mouth (9), an increase in the interception range, within which a coupling process with central buffer couplings which are offset axially with respect to one another can still be initiated as specified and can be terminated after the said central buffer couplings have been adjusted with respect to one another, is achieved.

Central buffer coupling for rail vehicles with a coupling head 
which exhibits a flat vertical front face and has a rotatable disc hook 

and an articulated coupling eye which, when the coupling is not in use, 
lies retracted inside a centring projection which, tapering conically on 

one front face half, protrudes beyond this towards the front, whereas a 
funnel disposed symmetrically in relation to the centring projection and 

extending into the inside of the coupling head and a guiding horn are 
provided on the other front face half so that two guides are formed by the 

guiding horn and the inner edge of the protruding centring projection for 
coupling the centring projection of a counterpart coupling head of the 

same design, characterised in that the guiding horn (9), which starts 
under the lower edge of the front face (1), protrudes from its starting 

point an amount further perpendicularly in front of the front face (1) and 
is firmly connected completely to the lower edge of the front face (1) 

from the starting point to almost its end by means of an angled piece 
(12), exhibits a straight guiding edge (11) which runs inclined downwards 

relative to a horizontal and the plane of the front face (1) so that the 
catcher tip (10a) at the end of the guiding horn (9) is located a vertical 

distance K below the lower edge of the front face (1) which is greater 
than half the vertical opening height P of the funnel (4) and less than 

the distance O from the horizontal middle axis b of the coupling head to 
the lower edge of the front face (1), with a perpendicular protrusion D in 

front of the plane of the front face (1) which roughly corresponds to the 
distance O, and in that the centring projection (3), which at its tip is a 

horizontal distance S of 1.25 times the breadth of the funnel (4) H to the 
catcher tip (10a) located at the end of the guiding horn (9), has at its 

lower edge a guiding bevel which is inclined at an angle of 64 - 52° to 
the front face (1), with a cone height L perpendicular to the front face 

(1) which roughly corresponds to half the opening height P of the 
funnel (4). 
Central buffer coupling according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the lower edge of the front face (1) ends a distance of approximately 

O minus P under the inner edge (5a) of the centring projection (3) whose 
recess (7) for passage of the coupling eye (2) lies completely on the side  

 
of the centring projection (3) running to the middle of the front face (1) 

which has an outward curvature. 
Central buffer coupling according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that on the upper and lower sides and on the side facing the edge of 

the front face (1) the centring projection (3) exhibits sloping flat faces 
which run into one another to the tip of the centring projection (3) in a 

perpendicular elongated ridge area. 
Central buffer coupling according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that on its edge located on the front face side the 

funnel (4) exhibits a guiding bevel (8) with extensions running to the 
upper and lower edge which run at an angle of 45° to the plane of the 

front face (1).
