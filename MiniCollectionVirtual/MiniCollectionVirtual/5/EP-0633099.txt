<ABSTRACT>
A tool for use with a ratchet wrench for removing and/or installing various types and 
sizes of fuel and oil filters, unscrewing and/or screwing different sizes of threaded 

pipe, turning and/or twisting fence posts, and moving and/or rolling logs. The tool has 
a belt or strap, with a buckle at one end and a magnet at the other end. The buckle 

grips the ratchet of a ratchet wrench and the belt is wrapped around the filter, pipe, 
post, or log. When the handle of the ratchet is moved, the buckle is pressed against 

the filter, pipe, post, or log, causing it to turn at the ratchet is turned. The magnet 
makes for more secure contact between the belt and a filter or pipe, which are made 

of metal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a mechanical tool. More particularly, the invention 
relates to a tool for use in combination with a ratchet wrench. In general, the present invention provides a tool for use with a ratchet wrench for 
turning a workpiece. The invention provides a tool which comprises an elongate 
flexible member adapted to wrap around a workpiece and a plate-like member which 
operatively abuts the elongate member such that when the tool is turned the plate-like 
member and elongate member cooperate to cause the workpiece to turn. The ratchet wrench preferably has a ratchet connected to a handle. The tool can 
comprise a rigid plate-like member; a rigid, straight elongated member, and an 
elongated flexible member. The plate-like member can have a planar face and a 
concave face, and first, second and third sides. The first and second sides of the plate-like 
member can be substantially parallel to one another, and the third side can be 
substantially perpendicular to the first and second sides. The first side can include an 
indentation constructed and arranged to engage the ratchet of the ratchet wrench. The 
straight elongated member can connect the indentation in the first side to the second 
side of the plate-like member. The elongated flexible member can have first and 
second ends. The first end of the elongated flexible member can be connected to the 
straight elongated member. The tool can be constructed and arranged so that, when 
the elongated flexible member is wrapped around the workpiece to be turned, when the 
ratchet is engaged by the indentation in the first side of the plate-like member, and  
 
when the handle of the ratchet wrench is moved to turn the ratchet, the concave surface 
of the elongated rigid member is pressed against the workpiece and causes the 
workpiece to turn as the ratchet is turned. 
FIGURE 1 is a side elevation of a ratchet tool made in accordance with the principles 
of the present invention; FIGURE 2 is a plan view of the tool shown in Figure 1; FIGURE 3 is a top view of the ratchet tool in combination with the universal 
extension; and FIGURE 4 is a cross-sectional view of the tool and extension shown in Figure 3 taken 
along the cutting line 4-4. The tool 2 comprises a plate or buckle 4 having a planar face 4a, a concave face 4b, 
a first side 4c, a second side 4d, and a third side 4e. There is a first square indentation 
4f in the first side 4c, and a second square indentation 4g in the second side 4d of the 
buckle 4. A pin 6 connects the

A tool for use with a ratchet wrench for turning a workpiece, the ratchet wrench 
having a ratchet connected to a handle, the tool comprising: 

   a rigid plate-like member having a planar face and a concave face, and 
first, second, and third sides, the first and second sides being 

substantially parallel to one another, the third side being substantially 
perpendicular to the first and second sides, the first side including an 

indentation which fits the ratchet; 
   a rigid, straight, elongated member connecting the 

indentation in the first side of the plate-like member to 
the second side of the plate-like member; and 

   an elongated flexible member having first and second 
ends, the first end of the elongated flexible member being 

connected to the elongated rigid member; 
the tool being constructed and arranged so that whereby, when the elongated flexible 

member is wrapped around the workpiece, when the ratchet is engaged by the 
indentation, and when the handle of the ratchet wrench is used to turn the ratchet, the 

concave face of the plate-like member is pressed against the workpiece and causes the 
workpiece to turn as the ratchet is turned. 
A tool according to claim 1 wherein the indentation is square. 
The tool of claim 1 or 2, further comprising:
 

   a magnet connected to the second end of the elongated 
flexible member, for holding the second end of the 

elongated flexible member in contact with a metallic 
workpiece. 
The tool of claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein the plate-like member is made of metal. 
The tool of any preceding claim, wherein the surface of the elongated flexible 
member is made of an elastomer. 
The tool of any preceding claim, wherein the surface of the elongated flexible 
member is made of rubber. 
The tool of any preceding claim, wherein the elongated flexible member is made 
of an elastomer. 
The tool of any preceding claim, wherein the elongated flexible member is made 
of rubber. 
A tool for use with a ratchet wrench for turning a workpiece, the ratchet wrench 
having a ratchet connected to a handle, the tool comprising: 

   a rigid plate-like member having a planar face and a 
concave face, and first, second and third sides, the first 

and second sides being substantially parallel to one 
another, the third side being substantially perpendicular 

 
to the first and second sides, the first side including a 

square indentation which fits the ratchet, and the second 
side has a square indentation therein; 

   a rigid, straight, elongated member connecting the 
indentation in the first side of the plate-like member to 

the indentation in the second side of the plate-like 
member; and 

   an elongated flexible member having first and second 
ends, the first end of the elongated flexible member being 

connected to the elongated rigid member; whereby, when 
the elongated flexible member is wrapped around the 

workpiece, when the ratchet is engaged by one of the 
square indentations, and when the handle of the ratchet 

wrench is used to turn the ratchet, the concave face of 
the plate-like member is pressed against the workpiece 

and causes the workpiece to turn as the ratchet is 
turned.
