<ABSTRACT>
Two fluids having different temperatures are to be mixed while supplying one fluid (A) through a main pipe (1) and conducting the other fluid (B) from a secondary pipe (2) into the main pipe. A mixing device (6) comprises a connecting branch which extends essentially radially into the main pipe (1) from the secondary pipe (2) and along whose outside the first fluid (A) may pass and which is formed with at least one nozzle-shaped aperture through which the second fluid (B) can be conducted into and mixed with the passing first fluid. The connecting branch comprises at least one through channel (13) extending transversely of the connecting branch and suitably in parallel with the longitudinal extent of the main pipe (1) and through which part of the first fluid can pass in a central partial flow. The inlet end of the channel (13) has a larger cross-sectional area than the outlet end, thereby giving the first fluid (A) an increased flow rate at the outlet end, the nozzle-shaped aperture being located adjacent this channel. In this manner, the second fluid is intimately mixed with the first in a centrally positioned area, while minimising every inclination of the second fluid to flow from the mixing device directly or abruptly, radially outwards towards the peripherally positioned main pipe (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device designed 
according to the preamble of claim 1 and intended for 
mixing two fluids, especially liquids, having different 
temperatures. In the systems of water pipes included in nuclear 
power plants and serving to conduct water to and from, 
inter alia, the reactor and the condenser, there are a 
plurality of points at which water having a certain temperature 
is to be mixed with water having a different temperature. 
This took previously place in simple T-piece 
connections or branch pipe points at which an open branch 
pipe opens directly into an aperture in the circumferential 
wall of a main pipe. At such branch points, the two 
water flows meet in an uncontrolled manner during rather 
intensive vorticity which, inter alia, implies that vortices 
or streaks of water having a certain, e.g. higher 
temperature than other streaks of water move back and 
forth both axially and sideways along the inside of the 
pipe wall of the main in the area downstream of the branch 
point. This means that at least the inside of the main 
pipe is subjected to intermittently repeated variations in 
temperature, leading to the pipe material, which in practice 
in most cases is acid-proof steel, alternately being 
subjected to compressive and tensile stress. This phenomenon, 
so-called thermal fatigue, shows itself in crack formations 
in the pipe material. If the differences in temperature 
between the two intermixed fluids are great, for 
example 50Â°C or more, and the fatigue continues for a long 
time, the crack formation may advance so far as to jeopardise 
security. The inclination to form cracks will be 
especially pronounced in the area of welds which are  
 
frequently to be found in the vicinity of the branch point 
downstream thereof. For the purpose of at least reducing the above-mentioned 
problems, attempts have recently been made to mount 
in the branch point between main and secondary pipes a 
special mixing device serving to control the mixing process 
in such a manner that the number of variations in 
temperature per unit of time along the internal surfaces 
of the pipe walls is reduced. For such mixing, use has 
been made of a connecting branch which extends essentially 
radially into the main pipe from the secondary pipe and in 
whose cylindrical circumferential surface there are formed 
a plurality of small perforations through which the water 
from the secondary pipe flows radially outwards in the 
form of a corresponding number of jets. In one embodiment,

<CLAIMS>
A device for mixing two fluids, especially 
liquids, having different temperatures, comprising a connecting 

branch (7) extending essentially radially into a 
primary pipe or main pipe (1) - through which a first 

fluid (A) is supplied - from a secondary pipe (2) - 
through which a second fluid (B) is supplied, the first 

fluid passing along the outside of said connecting branch 
which is formed with one or more nozzle-shaped apertures 

(16) through which the second fluid (B) can be conducted 
into and mixed with the passing first fluid (A), said connecting 

branch (7) having at least one through channel 
(13) which extends transversely of said connecting branch 

and suitably in parallel with the longitudinal extent of 
said main pipe (1) and through which part of said first 

fluid (A) can pass in a central partial flow spaced from 
the wall (3) of said main pipe, and said nozzle-shaped 

apertures (16) being positioned adjacent and surrounding 
said channel, thereby providing mixing of the second fluid 

in the first fluid in an area which is centrally positioned 
or spaced from the wall (3) of said main pipe, 


characterised
 in that the cross-sectional 
area of the inlet end (14) of said channel (13) is larger, 

for instance 2-8 times larger, than that of the outlet end 
(15), the channel becoming narrower from the inlet end 

towards the outlet end in order to give the first fluid 
(A) entering said channel an increased speed at the outlet 

end such that the first fluid entrains the surrounding 
flow of said second fluid (B) through said nozzle-shaped 

apertures (16), while minimising every inclination of the 
second fluid to flow from the mixing device directly or 

abruptly, radially outwards towards the peripherally positioned 
main pipe.  

 
Device as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised
 
in that the transverse channel (13) is defined by 

a duct (12) having an inlet end (14) which opens into an 
upstream portion of a circumferential wall of the connecting 

branch (7), and an outlet end (15) which is disposed 
in an aperture (16) formed in a diametrically opposite, 

downstream wall portion (7'), that said aperture (16) has 
a greater diameter or width than the outlet end of said 

duct (12), thereby forming, between the outside of the 
duct and an edge (17) in the circumferential wall (7') 

which defines the aperture, an annular gap which serves as 
a nozzle-shaped aperture for discharging the second fluid 

(B) in the main pipe, and that said duct (12) is composed 
of a conical tube portion (18) widening towards the inlet 

end, and a cylindrical tube portion (19) connecting with 
the outlet end. 
Device as claimed in claim 1 or 2, 
characterised
 
in that the nozzle-shaped aperture (16) is 

formed in a flat wall portion (7') which extends perpendicular 
to the longitudinal axis of said main pipe (1) and 

passes into the otherwise essentially cylindrical circumferential 
wall of said connecting branch via softly rounded 

wall portions. 
Device as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, 
characterised
 in that said nozzle-shaped 
aperture (16) comprises a number of, for instance 

four, wings (21, 21'; 22, 22') which project radially from 
the duct (12) and which sectorwise separate partial apertures 

(23, 24, 25, 26) for a corresponding number of partial 
flows through the nozzle-shaped aperture and of which 

two diametrically opposite wings (21, 21') pass into a 
substantially L-shaped guide plate (27) dividing the interior 

of the connecting branch into two separate flow paths 
(28, 28') having essentially equally large flow areas, 

thereby forming two equally large partial flows on opposite 
sides of said two wings.  

 
Device as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, 
characterised
 in that the free end 
(8) of said connecting branch (7), which is spaced from 

the secondary pipe (2), is closed by means of a cross-sectionally 
arc-shaped wall portion (31) having a straight 

back which is inclined relative to the centre axis of the 
main pipe (1), more precisely in such a manner that the 

upstream end of said back is positioned at a greater 
radial distance from the pipe wall (13) of said main pipe 

than the downstream end thereof. 
Device as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, 
characterised
 in that the connecting 
branch (7) has along its entire length a smaller diameter 

or width than the secondary pipe (2) or the mouth thereof 
in said main pipe, whereby said connecting branch can be 

mounted in an existing main pipe (1) without this being 
interfered with. 
Device as claimed in claim 6, 
characterised
 
in that the open end (9) of said connecting 

branch, which is spaced from the transverse duct (12), is 
fitted with a flange (10) which preferably together with 

suitable seals (11, 11') is clampable between flanges (4' 
4'' in a flange joint (4) for connecting two pipe portions 

(2', 2'') included in the secondary pipe (2).
