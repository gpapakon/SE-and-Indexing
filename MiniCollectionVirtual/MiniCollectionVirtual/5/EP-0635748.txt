<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid
crystal display apparatus with a wide viewing angle and
a method for producing the same.In a liquid crystal display (LCD), a liquid
crystal layer including liquid crystal molecules is
provided between a pair of substrates. When the
orientation direction of the liquid crystal molecules
is changed, the birefringence of the liquid crystal
layer is also changed. By utilizing the change in the
refractive index, the LCD performs the display. Accordingly,
it is important that the liquid crystal
molecules are arranged as regularly as possible in the
initial state. In order to regularly arrange the
liquid crystal molecules in the initial state, the
surface conditions of the substrates which sandwich the
liquid crystal layer should regulate the interactions
between the liquid crystal molecules and the surfaces.In the method for performing such a regulation
which is currently the most widely used, material
for a liquid crystal alignment film is applied to each
of the surfaces of the substrates which face the liquid
crystal layer. The applied material is dried and
cured, so as to form the alignment film. Thereafter,
the surface of the alignment film is rubbed. Thus, the
liquid crystal molecules can be aligned in the rubbing
direction. The rubbing treatment is unidirectionally
performed on the entire substrate, so that the liquid 
crystal molecules in the liquid crystal layer which are
in the vicinity of the substrate surface are aligned in
one direction. In addition, the tilt angles (i.e.,
pretilt angles) of the liquid crystal molecules in the
vicinity of the substrate with respect to the substrate
surface are substantially equal to each other.In an LCD which uses thin film transistors
(TFTs) as switching elements, i.e., in a TFT-LCD, the
construction of a twisted nematic (TN) type liquid
crystal layer is adopted (an LCD of the TN mode). In
such an LCD of the TN mode, the liquid crystal molecules
between the pair of substrates are continuously
twisted by 90° along the direction perpendicular to the
surfaces of the substrates, by means of the alignment
films formed in the inward-facing surfaces of the
substrates.Figure 18 is a plan view of an exemplary TN
type LCD, and Figure 19A shows a cross section of a
picture element portion of the TN type LCD. The LCD is
a TFT-LCD of an active matrix type. As is shown in
Figure 19A, a liquid crystal layer 133 is sandwiched
between substrates 131 and 132 which are provided so as
to face each other. The substrates 131 includes a
glass
