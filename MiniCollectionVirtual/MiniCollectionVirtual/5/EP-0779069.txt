<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an agent for 
activating hair matrix (or mother) cells, and a method 
of activating hair matrix cells. The present 
invention is applicable to in vivo or in vitro 
activation of hair matrix cells (promotion of cell 
division of hair matrix cells) in animals such as human 
being (including various kinds of pet animals, mink, 
etc.). With respect to the in-vivo activation of hair 
matrix cells (or production/growth of hair), there have 
heretofore been proposed many species of hair growth 
promoting agents or hair-nourishing agents (most of 
which are compositions), as disclosed in, e.g., 
Japanese Patent Publication (JP-B) Nos. Hei 6-4521 
(4521/1994) to 6-4524 (4524/1994), Japanese Patent 
Publication Nos. Hei 6-4526 (4526/1994) to 6-4528 
(4528/1994), etc. It has been observed that some of these 
conventional hair growth promoting or hair-nourishing  
 
agents show a certain effect of preventing alopecia (or 
baldness) or promoting hair growth, but the degree or 
magnitude of such an effect is not necessarily 
satisfactory. The reason for such insufficiency is 
considered to be that the cause of male-type alopecia 
includes complicated entanglement of various kinds of 
factors such as imbalance between sex hormones, 
incompetence of blood circulation, decrease in the 
activity of hair matrix cells, etc. Accordingly, at 
present, there has been desired a more effective hair-growing 
or hair-producing (or hair-developing) 
prescription. Further, very few examples of the conventional 
hair growth promoting or hair-nourishing agents have 
shown a function (resting phase-breaking function) of 
converting hair in the resting phase (or resting 
period, telogen) into that in the growth phase (or 
growth period, anagen) in its hair cycle. In other 
words, very few examples of these agents have shown an 
effect of producing hair (or developing hair). An object of the present invention is to provide 
an agent for activating hair matrix cells and a method 
of activating hair matrix cells, which has solved the 
above-mentioned problems encountered in the prior art. Another object of the present invention is to 
provide an agent for activating hair matrix cells or a  
 
method of activating hair matrix cells, which is 
capable of showing an effect of producing hair on the 
basis of a function (resting phase-breaking function) 
of converting hair in the resting phase into that in 
the growth phase in its hair cycle. As a result of earnest study, the present 
inventors have found that
