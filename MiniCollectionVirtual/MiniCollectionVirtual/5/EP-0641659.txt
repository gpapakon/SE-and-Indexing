<ABSTRACT>
A method is provided for assembling thermal ink-jet 
printheads. The method comprises: (a) providing a circuit 

layout (
10
) comprising a first substrate (
12
), a plurality 
of conductive traces (
14
) thereon in a pre-selected pattern, 
and a plurality of openings (
32
, 
34
) through the substrate 
defining ink-jet nozzles; (b) providing a die layout 

(
16
) comprising (1) a plurality of resistors (
24
), each resistor 
formed on a second substrate (
18
) and matched to an 
opening and (2) a plurality of channels (
14
') formed in a 
barrier material (
20
) and matched to a portion of the plurality 
of conductive traces; (c) inverting one layout with 

respect to the other so as to align the plurality of conductive 
traces with the plurality of channels; and (d) laminating 

those portions of the first substrate that contact 
the barrier to the barrier so as to bond the two layouts 

together. In one embodiment, the resistors are each formed 
in a well defined in a layer of the barrier material already 

on the substrate, which is extended to encompass the 
resistors. In a second embodiment, the barrier material 

around the resistors is omitted, and the resistors are 
simply formed on the substrate. In either case, the 

barrier material comprises a photopolymerizable material 
and each resistor matched to a nozzle forms a firing chamber 

(
30
). The advantage of the invention over what has 
been done before is the ability to utilize photodefinable 

features on the two primary components so as to provide 
both performance and cost advantages.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to thermal ink-jet pens,
and, more particularly, to an improved construction of the
printheads used in such pens.Thermal ink-jet pens comprise a reservoir of ink and
a printhead for expelling droplets of the ink onto a print
medium, such as paper. The printhead includes resistor
elements located in firing chambers fed with a supply of
ink from a plenum chamber, which is fluidically connected
to the ink reservoir. Resistor elements are selectively
heated to expel the droplets of ink from the firing chamber
through an orifice in an orifice plate.During fabrication of the printhead, there are a number
of elements in the process that either are expensive or
have the potential to result in an inferior product. For
example, complex vision systems are currently required to
align the orifice plate to the resistors during assembly of
the printhead. The better the alignment, the better the
print quality. A simple method of alignment, coupled with
a high degree of precision, would be desirable.Another recurring problem is adhesion of the orifice
plate to the substrate, on which the resistors are formed.
Delamination can occur from residual stresses. A present 
goal is improved adhesion of the orifice plate to the
substrate.While current manufacturing techniques offer
marginal alignment for consistent print quality, they are
costly. Thus, a need remains for an improved process for
aligning the orifice plate so that the orifices therein line
up with the resistors.US-A-4612554 describes the manufacture of an inkjet
printhead from two substantially identical parts, each
having V-grooves anisotropically etched between a linear
array of heating elements having addressable electrodes
parallel to each other. The grooved parts permit them to
be mated face-to-face, so that they are automatically
self-aligned by the inter-meshing of the lands of one
part with the grooves of the other part.In accordance with the invention, a method is
provided for assembling thermal ink-jet printheads. The
method comprises:
(a) providing a circuit layout comprising a first
substrate, a plurality of conductive traces thereon in a
pre-selected pattern, and a plurality of openings through
the substrate defining ink-jet nozzles;(b) providing a die layout comprising (1) a
plurality of resistors, each resistor formed on a second
substrate and matched to one of the openings and (2) a
plurality of channels formed in a barrier material and
matched to a portion of the plurality of conductive
traces, the barrier material
