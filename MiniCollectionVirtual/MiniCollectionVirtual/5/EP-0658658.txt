<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a framework (7) for construction panels, the framework essentially being formed of intersecting wooden elements (1, 8, 10), the panels (21, 22, 30, 31, 32) including such a framework, as well as buildings constructed from such panels (21, 22, 30, 31, 32). The framework of these panels has two series of planks (1, 8, 10) arranged substantially along two perpendicular axes. The planks (1, 8, 10) of the first series (A) are placed with their wide faces (2) parallel to each other, perpendicular to the plane of the panels (21, 22) and have cutouts (3) aligned one after another. The planks (1, 8, 10) of the second series (B) are slipped through the cutouts (3) of the planks of the first series (A) and secured thereto. This type of framework for panels lends itself to the construction of semi-prefabricated buildings and to the construction of buildings on site using unskilled labour.

Framework (7, 20) for building-panel, the 
framework being formed of elements which intersect at two 

orthogonal axes, comprising an assembly of two series (A, 
B) of planks (1, 8, 10) each arranged substantially 

parallel to one of the two axes, each plank (1, 8, 10) 
comprising two broad faces (2) extending longitudinally; 


the first series (A) of planks comprising at least two 
planks (1, 8, 10) arranged with their broad faces (2) 

perpendicular to the plane of the panel, these broad faces 
(2) being pierced with longitudinal cut-outs (3), the cut-outs 

(3) in the various planks of the first series (A) 
being aligned in a row; 
the second series (B) of planks comprising at least one 
plank (1, 8, 10) arranged with the broad faces (2) parallel 

to the plane of the panel, characterized in that the said 
cut-outs (3) are sha
ped as buttonhole slots and that the 
planks (1, 8, 10) of the second series (B) are slipped 

through the cut-out buttonhole slots (3) of the planks (1) 
of the first series, the planks (1, 8, 10) of the two 

series (A, B) being fastened together where they intersect 
by fastening means (9). 
Framework according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the planks (1, 8, 10) of the two series (A, B) are 

pierced with longitudinal cut-outs in the shape of buttonhole 
slots (3) spaced out along their length. 
Framework according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the fastening means 

(9) are angle brackets (9). 
Framework according to any one of Claims 1, 
2, 3, characterized in that the broad faces (2) of the 

planks (1, 8, 10) comprise, along each of their 
longitudinal edges, a line of perforations (4) which are 

perpendicular to these broad faces (2) and are arranged at 
uniform spacings (6) apart.  

 
Framework according to Claim 4, characterized 
in that it comprises planks (1, 8, 10) of rectangular 

section, with different widths and thicknesses, the width 
and length of the longitudinal cut-out buttonhole slots (3) 

being such that they allow the largest section of plank (1, 
8, 10) used to be inserted therein. 
Framework according to Claim 5, characterized 
in that the dimensions of the planks (1, 8, 10) and the 

spacings (6) between the perforations (4) are calculated as 
multiples of a modulus E. 
Framework according to Claim 6, characterized 
in that it comprises modular planks (1) the thickness (5a) 

of which is equal to E and the width of which is equal to 
6 E. 
Framework according to any one of Claims 6 
and 7, characterized in that it comprises modular planks 

(10), the width of which is 6 E and the thickness (5b) of 
which is 2 E. 
Framework according to any one of Claims 6, 
7 and 8, characterized in that it comprises-modular planks 

(8) of thickness 2 E and of width 10 E. 
Framework according to Claim 6, 
characterized in that the modular planks (1, 8, 10) 

comprise at least one additional line of perforations (11) 
on their broad faces (2). 
Framework according to Claim 10, 
characterized in that the modular planks (1, 8, 10) 

comprise at least one series of longitudinal cut-outs in 
the shape of buttonhole slots (3) which is aligned between 

one central additional line of perforations (11) and a line 
of perforations (4) running along the longitudinal edge of 

the broad faces (2). 
Framework according to any one of Claims 6 to 
11, characterized in that the spacing (6) between the 

perforations (4) is 4 E, the distance separating the edge 
of the broad faces (2) and the line of perforations (4)  

 
being equal to E. 
Building panel comprising a covering on at 
least one of its faces, characterized in that it comprises 

a framework (7) according to any one of the preceding 
claims. 
Panel according to Claim 13, characterized 
in that it comprises at least one cut-out (35), the dimensions 

of which are a multiple of the modulus E forming a 
reveal (35) for the insertion of a casing having the 

corresponding modular dimensions. 
Building characterized in that its structure 
comprises at least one framework (7, 20) for a panel (21, 

22, 30, 31, 32) according to any one of Claims 1 to 12. 
Building according to Claim 15, 
characterized in that the dimensions of the frameworks (7) 

built into its structure are multiples of the value E.
