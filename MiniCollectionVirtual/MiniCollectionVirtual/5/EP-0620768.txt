<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an adjustable device 
for exhaustion and/or supply of gases and gas supported particles, 
said device comprising at least one exhaustion and/or 
supply conduit which is pivotable in at least vertical direction, 
whereby at least one force-producing balancing device 
including at least one tension spring is provided for balancing 
the exhaustion and/or supply conduit, and whereby the 
force-producing balancing device cooperates with a compensating 
device. The document FR-A-2 525 930 is describing an adjustable 
device, whereby helical springs are used as balancing means 
for an exhaust device with a hood at the end of tubular articulating 
conduits. The springs act two ways in this device, 
i.e. according to the extension thereof and owing to friction 
against the walls of a guiding groove. Moreover, this 
device relies on additional friction discs to maintain the 
hood in position.  
 A problem with this and other balancing devices for adjustable 
devices of said type is that said balancing devices 
do not produce balanced forces corresponding with the actual 
balancing need. This means that one must use friction links 
which provide sufficient friction for maintaining the conduit 
in all positions set. A drawback with friction links 
providing sufficient friction for maintaining the conduit in 
said positions is however, that a large frictional effect 
must be overcome when the conduit is pivoted in vertical direction, 
which means that it is heavy to manipulate. The object of the present invention is among other 
things to see to, at adjustable devices of the abovementioned 
type, that the balancing device produce balanced forces which 
correspond with the correct balancing need. This is arrived 
at according to the invention by providing the abovementioned 
device with the characterizing features of claim 1. By means of said characterizing features an easily controllable 
conduit is provided, which maintains substantially 
all its set positions without needing friction links therefor, 
producing great friction forces for this maintenance. The invention will be further described below with reference 
to the accompanying drawings, wherein fig. 1 is a  
 
side view of an adjustable device according to the invention 
having two adjustable conduit members; fig. 2 is a side view 
of a first alternative embodiment of the adjustable device 
according to the invention, whereby two adjustable conduit 
members are provided on an extension device; fig. 3 is a
