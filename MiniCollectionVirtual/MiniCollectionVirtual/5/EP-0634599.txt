<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a flexible pipe connection, in particular for a vacuum toilet system on board an aeroplane, flanges being arranged on the pipe ends which are to be connected, the invention consists in the fact that each pipe end is provided with a flange element which comprises a socket 4,5 and a flange 6,7, which are connected integrally to one another, the flange elements consisting of an elastic material and exhibiting a contact layer and, by means of their sockets 4,5, enclosing the pipe ends from the outside and being fastened in each case by at least one bracing clamp 8, and in each case one supporting ring 9,10 with an outer conical surface being arranged on the rear sides of the flanges 6,7. In this arrangement, it is, in particular, advantageous that the connections between the flanges and the pipes can be easily produced and released.
