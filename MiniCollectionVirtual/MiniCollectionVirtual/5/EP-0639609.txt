<ABSTRACT>
A process for making reduced gloss 
thermoplastic resin compositions is provided. The 

process involves compounding a nitrile polymer with 
an electrophilic reagent to form a polymeric gel 

compound, blending the polymeric gel compound with a 
first thermoplastic resin and a weight ratio of 

between 5:1 and 0.5:1 to make a concentrate 
comprising gels dispersed in the first thermoplastic 

resin, and admixing the concentrate with a second 
thermoplastic resin produced the desired composition, 

wherein the concentrate is used at a level of from 2 
to 60 percent by weight based on the total weight of 

the composition. The process provides improved 
product consistency, and consistently yields a 

product exhibiting reduced gloss and high levels of 
impact strength with a uniformly dispersed 

concentration of polymeric gels therein. The 
compositions are useful in making molded articles 

exhibiting consistent reduced gloss and high impact 
strengths.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to processes for
making reduced gloss thermoplastic compositions, and
more particularly relates to a process for producing
reduced gloss thermoplastic compositions having
improved impact strengths, gloss levels, and
flammability ratings.Low gloss compositions comprising a polymer
blend of a polycarbonate and an emulsion grafted ABS
polymer, and a low gloss enhancing amount of a
polyepoxide are known. See Jalbert et al. U.S.
Patent No. 5,026,777 which is incorporated herein by
reference. A single step compounding process can
result in undesired side reactions, including side
reactions of the polyepoxide with additional
ingredient such as phosphite stabilizers and some
organic and metal pigments which may affect product
consistency and quality. Also, in general, a single
step compounding processes as set out in Jalbert
exhibit consistency problems in obtaining consistent
combinations of desired levels of low gloss and high
impact strength, as well as other properties. Attempts to overcome some of these problems include
pending EP applications (1) EP-A-0590847, entitled
Process Improvement for Improved Color Reduced Gloss
Thermoplastic Compositions which involve compounding an
acrylonitrile polymer with an electrophilic reagent to
form polymeric gels and admixing an effective amount of
water with the polymeric gels sufficient to reduce the
yellowness index of the gels, and blending an effective
gloss reducing amount of the reduced color gels with a
thermoplastic resin; and (2) EP-A-0561512, titled Reduced
Gloss Thermoplastic Compositions and Processes for Making
Thereof, which involves compounding an acrylonitrile
polymer with an electrophilic reagent to form polymeric
gels, and blending an effective gloss reducing amount of
the gels with a thermoplastic resin. These prior EP
applications set out solutions to some of the problems
encountered in the single step process set out in Jalbert
et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,026,777, but a problem still
exists in the inconsistency of producing a product having
adequate physical properties such as surface gloss and
impact strength.Consequently, there is a need to provide a
process which provides a consistent dispersion of the
gels in the matrix resin, and thereby provides a
consistently low gloss and consistently high impact
strength in the final composition. Figure 1 is a chart showing improved
consistency obtained by the process of the present
invention.The present invention is directed to a process
for making a reduced gloss

ratio first thermoplastic resin to

polymeric compound of between 5:1 and
0.5:1 to make a concentrate comprising

gels dispersed in the first thermoplastic
resin, and
