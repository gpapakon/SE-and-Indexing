<ABSTRACT>
In an engine starter comprising a one-way clutch 
provided around a pinion support shaft carrying a 

pinion in a torque transmitting relationship but in an 
axially slidable manner, and an annular input gear to 

transmit torque to a clutch outer member of the one-way 
clutch, to prevent an eccentricity of the clutch outer 

member from seriously affecting the coupling structure 
between the motor and the input gear, the outer 

circumferential surface of the clutch outer member is 
provided with an external teeth serration while the 

input gear 12 is provided with an internal teeth 
serration so as to form a serration coupling. The 

serration coupling is provided with a sufficient 
radially play to accommodate a maximum eccentricity of 

the clutch outer member. Thus, the engine starter can 
be made reliable in use without requiring any undue 

precision during the fabrication process.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an engine 
starter, and in particular to an engine starter 
provided with a one-way clutch interposed between a 
torque transmitting member such as an input gear and a 
pinion which is adapted to be selectively engaged with 
a ring gear of an engine. Conventionally, in an automotive engine starter, 
the torque of a motor is transmitted to a pinion via a 
one-way clutch, for instance, of a roller clutch type, 
and the pinion is in turn selectively meshed with a 
ring gear of an engine as disclosed, for instance, in 
Japanese utility model laid-open publication (kokai) 
No. 3-41169. According to such an engine starter, the clutch 
outer member of the one-way clutch surrounds the base 
end of the pinion support shaft which forms the clutch 
inner member, and the clutch outer member is integrally 
coupled with a torque transmitting member which is in 
turn coupled with an output shaft of a motor via gears. 
The radially central part of the torque transmitting 
member is provided with means for coupling with the 
clutch outer member while its outer circumferential 
surface is provided with external teeth to be coupled 
with the output shaft of the motor via gears. According to such a one-way clutch, the clutch 
outer member inevitably involves a small eccentricity 
during its operation or due to a fabrication error 
which could affect the gear coupling with the motor 
output shaft, and if the eccentricity is excessive, it 
could not only produce noises from the gears but also 
could damage the gear coupling structure. Therefore, 
it has been necessary to machine and assemble the  
 
various component parts with a sufficient precision so that the 
bearings for the clutch outer member may be free from any such 
eccentricity as much as possible, and / or to design the gear 
coupling portion to have a sufficient durability. In either 
case, the fabrication cost and the amount of necessary work 
increase, and the size of the engine starter has to be 
increased. In view of such problems of the prior art, a primary 
object of the present invention is to provide an improved 
engine starter in which an eccentricity of the clutch outer 
member would not seriously affect the coupling structure 
between the motor and the torque transmitting member. A second object of the present invention is to provide an 
engine starter which is easy and economical to fabricate. A third object of the present invention is to provide an 
engine starter which is durable in use. According to the present
