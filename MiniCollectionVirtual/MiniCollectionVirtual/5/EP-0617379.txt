<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a data transmission system comprising 
a first device (2) having first clock generator (24) for 

generating a first clock signal for data exchange with a 
second device (1), second clock generator (25) for 

generating a second clock signal for resetting the 
second device (1) to be operable, and clock supplying 

unit (23, 26, 27) for supplying the first and second 
clock signals to the second device (1), and the second 

device (1) for performing data exchange with the first 
device (2) in response to the first clock, the second 

device (1) being reset by the second clock. It is thus 
possible to ensure data exchange using existing hardware 

such as a UART, while supplying a reset clock whose frequency 
will not be a multiple of 1200 bps even by 

frequency division by 2
n
, to the IC card. This data 
transmission system will therefore cope with both the 

demand for the ISO standardization and the use of 
existing hardware.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a data transmission system which is capable of the compatibility of the demand for the ISO standardization with the use of existing hardware.Recently, data transmission systems which use an IC card as a portable data storage media are noted. This IC card is generally operable upon reception of power, clocks, etc. from an external device. With regard to signals supplied to IC cards, there is an international standard already established by, particularly, ISO/IEC7816-3. This standard specifies that, upon receiving the initial response data (which will be called "Answer to Reset") from an IC card, a clock of 3.5712 MHz should be supplied to the IC card to cause the Answer to Reset to be transmitted at a rate of 9600 bps. After that, different ratios between the input frequency and the data transmission rate should selectively be used for subsequent data exchanges, as needed. A technique for switching clock signals supplied to the IC card is disclosed in USP 5,099,141. The ISO standard requires a frequency of 3.5712 MHz to reset IC cards.EP-A-0 347 894 describes an IC card reader/writer with a frequency mode identifying means for determining whether or not an IC card loaded therein has an identifiable frequency. When the frequency mode of the IC card is identifiable, clock frequency determining means reads frequency data representative of an operating clock frequency out of the IC card to determine the operating clock frequency particular to that card. Based on the determined operating clock frequency of the IC card, frequency setting means in the IC card reader/writer converts clock pulses generated by a reference clock generating means into clock pulses which match the clock frequency of the IC card, and feeds those clock pulses to the card.However, a basic clock used in the conventional hardware for data exchange at the rate of 9600 bps cannot be obtained by simply 2n frequency-dividing this frequency of the ISO standard, 3.5712 MHz. If an external device tries to accomplish data exchange with an IC card using a UART or the like, it should divide this frequency irregularly or employ some other method to produce the basic clock. This makes the hardware of the external device complex and redundant. What is more, it is difficult to produce a clock with a highly precise frequency even by the irregular frequency division. Further, in the apparatus disclosed in the above USP 5,099,141, the clock used for transmitting/receiving data between the apparatus and the IC card is not
