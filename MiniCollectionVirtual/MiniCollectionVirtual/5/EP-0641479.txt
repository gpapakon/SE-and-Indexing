<ABSTRACT>
The combinational system consists essentially of combination plates (1) which can be joined together by linear and angular connecting strips (3, 3') on their back sides to form flat and cuboid combinations (Fig. 1 and 8). On their front sides the combination plates (1) have in each case a storage bed (1b) used to hold a compact disk box (2) which is secured in place by means of an angle bracket (1d) and a snap-in pin (1e) so that a compact disk (5) can be removed without displacing the box (2). An additional storage plate (21) with box insertion channels (21a) for CD boxes (2) can be both inserted into the spaces (20) of a cuboid combination and used as a cover plate. In flat combinations (Fig. 8) angular magazines (30) can be inserted for additional storage of CD boxes (2). This is thus a new combinational system with large storage capacity, one that allows the end user room to exercise imagination in devising diverse, extremely decorative, stable combinations. The handling is very simple.

<CLAIMS>
A combination system for receiving compact discs (5) packaged
in hinged-lid cases (2), hereinafter referred to as CD-cases for the sake

of brevity, which has rectangular combination plates (1) and bar-like
connecting means (3) for mutually fixing them, wherein the combination

plates (1) are provided at the front side with angular, storage bedforming
portions (1d, 1e) formed thereon for securing the CD-cases (2) in

position, characterised in that formed on the combination plates (1) at
the front side per respective storage bed (1b) which is allocated for only

one CD-case along a storage bed peripheral side is a projecting angle (1d)
which is open towards the storage bed (1b) and which is shorter in its

longitudinal direction with respect to the length of said storage bed
peripheral side at both sides, for engaging over a hinge-side edge region

(2a) of a placed CD-case (2), while disposed in the region of the storage
bed peripheral side which is parallel to said angle is a retaining tongue

(1e) which acts towards the storage bed (1b) for engaging over a
projecting bottom edge (2b) of the CD-case (2), and that the combination

plates (1) have at the rear in the region of each side edge at least one
mounting seat (1g) formed thereon for connecting bars (3, 3') provided

with counterpart mounting seats (3b), wherein formed in part on the
mounting seats (1g) and in part on the counterpart mounting seats (3b) are

retaining means which correspond to each other, in the manner of
projections and recesses (3d, 1m), and which form retaining connections

which have a self-resilient action.
A combination system according to claim 1 characterised in
that the connecting bars are in the form of angle bars (3') for the

purposes of combining the combination plates (1) to afford three-dimensional
spatial shapes.
A combination system according to one of claims 1 and 2
characterised in that the combination plate (1) is provided for each side

edge with a plurality of mounting seats (lg) which are at a mutual spacing
of nX, 
wherein n is an integer. 
A combination system according to one of claims 1 to 3
characterised in that the mounting seats (11g) and the counterpart

mounting seats (13b) are enclosed by web portions (11f and 13a
respectively) which in turn have projections and recesses (13d and 11m

respectively) of the self-resilient retaining connections.
A combination system according to one of claims 1 to 3
characterised in that the mounting seats (1g) and the counterpart mounting

seats (3b) are enclosed by web portions (1f and 3a respectively) and are
provided with portions (1h, 3g) which are in the form of hollow

projections and which engage one over the other and which are provided all
around with retaining means comprising projections and recesses (3d and lm

respectively) and which at least partially comprise self-resilient
segments (3c).
A combination system according to one of claims 1 to 5
characterised in that formed on the combination plates (1) in their rear

edge regions are flange-like spacer feet (1p) which are provided with
stacking recesses (1p') in the edge region of storage bed flange portions

(1a) at the front side.
A combination system according to one of claims 1 to 6
characterised in that by virtue of the omission of a perpendicular

combination plate an arrangement comprising at least one cuboidal
combination unit (B) comprising combination plates (1) which are joined

together in right-angled relationship has a laterally accessible space
(20), and that a magazine plate (21) provided with mutually parallel

insertion passages (21a) is arranged at least in one of the planes which
extend perpendicularly to the opening of the space (20) and which extend

around same, for additionally positioning CD-cases (2).
A combination system according to claim 7 characterised by a
magazine plate (21) which is to be placed in cuboidal combinations as a

horizontal intermediate or cover member and which is so dimensioned that 
spacer slots (21e) for connecting bars (3) to pass therethrough remain

between the magazine plate (21) and the perpendicular combination plates
(1), surrounding same, of the corresponding cuboidal combination units (A

to C).
A combination system according to one of claims 1 to 6
characterised by an angular magazine (30) for insertion into a flat

assembly of combination plates (1), wherein a magazine limb (30b) is
provided at the inside of the angle with parallel insertion passages (30d)

for CD-cases while the other magazine limb (30a) is of the same size as a
combination plate (31) and is provided at the rear with identical mounting

seats (such as lg) for connecting bars (3).
A combination system according to claim 2 characterised in
that the two magazine limbs (30a, 30b) represent separate components which

are to be assembled by the consumer.
