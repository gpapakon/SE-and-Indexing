<ABSTRACT>
In a vacuum casting method, a molding cavity (6) 
is reduced in pressure to a vacuum, and when a gate (10) is 

opened, a molten metal which has been raised to a molten 
metal retaining dome (8) is charged into the molding cavity 

(6) at a high speed. When a portion of a molten metal held 
in a molten metal holding furnace (22) is raised to the 

molten metal retaining dome (8) via a stalk (20), (a) the 
rising speed of a portion of the molten metal (24) is set at 

5 - 10 cm/sec, or (b) the rising speed is varied between an 
early stage of the rising motion and a later stage of the 

rising motion. In the latter method, the rising speed at 
the early stage of the rising motion is set at a speed 

higher than 10 cm/sec, while the rising speed at the later 
stage of the rising motion is set at 5 - 10 cm/sec. Due to 

the rising speed control, air involvement by the rising 
molten metal (24) is effectively prevented.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vacuum casting
method of the type wherein a molding cavity is reduced in
pressure to a vacuum and upon opening a gate, a molten metal
is charged into the molding cavity at a high speed
according to the features as laid out in the preamble of claim
1. Such a method is e.g. known from JP-A-2155557.
More
particularly, the present invention relates to an improved
vacuum casting method in which bubbles and solid metal
pieces are prevented from being involved in the molten metal
as it is charged into the molding cavity.As one example of a light alloy casting method of
a high quality and a low cost, a vacuum precharged closed
squeezed casting method was proposed by the present
applicant in Japanese Patent Application No. HEI 4-309534
filed on October 23, 1992.In the proposed vacuum casting method, a molding
cavity is shut off from an interior of a molten metal
retaining dome by a gate. Then, the molding cavity is
reduced in pressure to a vacuum, and substantially
simultaneously a portion of a molten metal held in a molten
metal holding furnace is raised to the molten metal
retaining dome. Thereafter, the gate is opened so that the
molten metal in the molten metal retaining dome is charged
into the molding cavity at a high speed due to the vacuum in 
the molding cavity. The molding cavity is then shut-off by
a shut pin, and the molten metal in the molding cavity is
pressurized by inserting a pressure pin into the molding
cavity. Thereafter, the molten metal in the molding cavity
is cooled to be solidified.In the proposed vacuum casting method, since the
molding cavity is reduced in pressure to a vacuum before the
molten metal is charged into it, the molten metal has few or
no bubbles once in the molding cavity. But, because of the
vacuum generated in the molding cavity, the charging speed
of the molten metal is very high. The vacuum casting method
allows the molten metal to run smoothly in the molding
cavity and, as a result, slimmer and lighter casting
products are possible.However, to realize a higher quality of casting
using the above-described vacuum casting method, it is
necessary to prevent the molten metal from involving air
when it rises in the molten metal retaining dome via a stalk
from a molten metal holding furnace, because the molten
metal contacts air in the stalk and in the molten metal
retaining dome.An object of the present invention is to provide a
vacuum casting method which prevents air involvement by a 
molten metal when rising in a stalk and in a molten
