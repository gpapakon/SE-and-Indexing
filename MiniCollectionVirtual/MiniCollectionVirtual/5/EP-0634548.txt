<ABSTRACT>
In a door locking system of the type having a 
security mechanism (10) for locking a locking button (4) when a 

lock cylinder (2) is locked, a switch lever is installed on 
a lock cylinder main body for rotation therewith, and 

an operating force transmitting lever is rotatably 
installed on the lock cylinder main body and 

operatively connected to the locking button (4). The 
switch lever and the operating force transmitting lever 

are connected in such a manner as to allow, when the 
lock cylinder main body is rotated from a locking 

position to a security mechanism unlocking position, 
the switch lever to rotate relative to the operating 

force transmitting lever. When the switch lever is 
rotated into the security mechanism unlocking position, 

the security mechanism (10) is electrically or 
electromagnetically actuated to unlock the locking 

button (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to a
locking system for vehicle doors and particularly to an
automotive door locking system of the type having an
antitheft deadlock or security mechanism.A known door locking system is provided with an
antitheft deadlock or security mechanism adapted to
hold a locking lever, which is movable between a
locking position and an unlocking position for locking
and unlocking a locking mechanism, in the locking
position and prevent movement of the locking lever out
of the locking position when the locking mechanism has
been locked by a lock cylinder which is operated from
the outside of the door with a key. Insofar as the
security mechanism holds the locking lever in the
locking position, the locking mechanism cannot be
unlocked by a locking button which is operated from the
inside of the door. By this, it is intended to attain
an improved antitheft effect since the locking
mechanism cannot be unlocked even when an access to the
locking button is attained by breaking a door
glass. A door locking system having such a locking
lever is disclosed in GB 2,034,802.When the locking mechanism is to be unlocked, an
unlocking switch is operated to make the security
mechanism unlock the locking lever, prior to an
operation of the lock cylinder for unlocking the
locking mechanism. A problem of the prior art door locking system of
the above described kind is that unlocking of the
locking mechanism requires a troublesome operation
since an addition operation of an unlocking switch for
unlocking the security mechanism is necessary prior to
an unlocking operation of the lock cylinder.In accordance with the present invention, there
is provided an improved locking system for a
door. The locking system comprises a locking mechanism
capable of being locked and unlocked for respectively inhibiting and
enabling opening of the door, a lock cylinder
connected via a first rod to the locking mechanism and
operated from the outside of the door, the lock
cylinder having a lock cylinder main body rotatable
between a locking position and an unlocking position
for causing the locking mechanism to be locked and
unlocked, respectively, a locking button connected via
a second rod to the locking mechanism and operated from
the inside of the door, the locking button being
movable between a locking position and an unlocking
position for causing the locking mechanism to be locked
and unlocked, respectively, a security mechanism
electrically or electromagnetically actuated to lock
the locking button in the

said locking mechanism and operated from the inside of

the door, said locking button being movable between a
locking position and an unlocking position for causing

said locking mechanism to be locked and unlocked,
respectively;
a security mechanism (10) electrically or
electromagnetically actuated to lock said locking

button (4) in said locking position thereof or unlock said
locking button;
control circuit means (13) for controlling electric or
electromagnetic actuation of said security mechanism (10);
locking switch means (22a) for supplying, when closed
in response to rotation of said lock cylinder main body (21)

into said locking position thereof, to said control
circuit means (13) a signal for causing said security

mechanism (10) to lock said locking button (4) in said locking
position thereof;
unlocking switch means (22b) for supplying, when closed
in response to rotation of said lock cylinder main body (21)

into said security mechanism unlocking position, to 
said control circuit means (13) a signal for causing said

security mechanism (10) to unlock said locking button; and
a lever unit (8) installed on an end portion of said
lock cylinder main body (21) for transmitting an operation

force applied to said lock cylinder to said first rod (9)
whilst converting rotary motion of said lock cylinder

main body to reciprocating motion of said first rod;
said lock cylinder main body further being
rotatable into a security mechanism unlocking position

located between said locking position and said
unlocking position;
said lever unit (8) having a switch lever (8a) installed
on said end portion (21a) of said lock cylinder main body (21) for

rotation therewith for causing said locking switch
means (22a) to be closed when said lock cylinder main body is
