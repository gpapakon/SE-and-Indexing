<ABSTRACT>
An antenna system, comprising two similar 
antennas (1) with a monopulse feed system, is scanned 

while transmitting in phase radio waves from the two 
antennas. Reflected radio waves are received by the 

two antennas (1) and fed to a hybrid circuit (4) which 
in turn produces a sum signal (Σ) and a difference 

signal (Δ). After detection is performed by a 
detector (5), a signal processing unit (6) performs 

double differential processing on the sum signal (Σ) 
and the differential signal (Δ). In this processing 

step, the sum signal is output only if the double 
differential coefficient of said sum signal is equal 

to or less than a predefined positive real number 
value if the double differential coefficient of said 

difference signal is equal to or greater than a 
predefined negative real number value, and a zero 

signal is output in any other cases. Thus, the beam 
width of an antenna pattern is compressed without 

missing a necessary output signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of performing 
beam compression of an antenna pattern, which can provide 
better performances in the beam compression process of an 
antenna pattern of a radar including a monopulse power feed 
system. In general, the beam width is one of the indexes representing 
the performance of an antenna pattern of a receiving 
antenna or other type antennas. A narrower beam width in an 
antenna pattern will give a better performance. However, 
there is a relationship of inverse proportion between the 
beam width and the size (length) of an antenna. Therefore, 
if the beam width is reduced, then the size of the antenna 
will be increased. Conversely, if the dimension of the 
antenna is reduced, then the beam width will be broadened. For example, in an antenna for a radar system, if it is 
desired to double the ability or the resolution to 
discriminate objects, it is required to halve the beam width 
and thus it is required to double the size of the antenna.  
 
The doubling of the size leads to not only a larger occupied 
region but also various disadvantages such as an increase 
in the weight of the antenna and in the size of a structure 
for supporting the antenna. Conversely, if the size of an 
antenna is halved, then the beam width will be doubled and 
the discrimination ability will be degraded by a factor of 
two. It is well known that there is such a conflicting 
relationship between the beam width and the size of an 
antenna. In most cases, an actual antenna has a limitation 
in the region it can occupy. Therefore, under these limited 
conditions, a certain degree of compromise associated with 
the beam width has to be made. One known beam compression technique to alleviate the 
above-described problems is to employ two similar antennas 
with a monopulse power feed system so as to reduce the beam 
width by subtracting the difference signal pattern between 
the two antennas from the sum signal pattern of the two 
antennas as disclosed in EP 540 249. Figure 1 of the accompanying drawings is schematic diagram illustrating a 
radar system which can perform the beam compression in such 
a manner described above. In this figure, reference numerals 
101, 101 designate a pair of antennas with a monopulse 
power feed system, wherein each antenna has a length of a, 
and the center-to-center distance between the antennas is 
d. Reference numeral 102 designates a power divider and  
 
reference numeral 103 designates a transmitting circuit.

A method for compressing the beam width of the 
antenna pattern of a radar antenna, comprising the steps of: 


providing a radar antenna system comprising two 
similar antennas including a monopulse feed system; 
scanning said antenna system while transmitting radio 
waves from said two antennas of the antenna system in such 

a manner that both the radio waves transmitted from the 
respective antennas are in the same phase; 
receiving by the antenna system the radio waves which 
were transmitted from said antenna system and reflected by 

scattering objects and have finally come back to said 
antenna system; 
calculating a double differential coefficient of a 
sum signal by differentiating twice the sum signal of 

signals received by said two antennas of the antenna system 

with respect to the scanning angle; 
calculating a double differential coefficient of a 
difference signal by differentiating twice the difference 

signal of signals received by said two antennas of the 
antenna system with respect to the scanning angle; and 
processing the output signal such that said sum signal 
is output as a final output signal only if the double 

differential coefficient of said sum signal is equal to or 
less than a predefined positive real number value and if the  

 
double differential coefficient of said difference signal 

is equal to or greater than a predefined negative real 
number value, and a zero signal is output in any other 

cases.
