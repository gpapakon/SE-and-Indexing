phonemes constituting the audiofrequency signal. 
Device according to any one of the preceding Claims, characterized 
in that the means forming an input amplifier (AP, AP') comprise 

two amplifier stages, each proper for amplifying separately and 
independently of one another a respective audiofrequency signal Oe.
