<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a hitherto unknown class of 
compounds which shows antiinflammatory and immunomodulating 
effects as well as strong activity in inducing differentiation 
and inhibiting undesirable proliferation of certain 
cells, including cancer cells and skin cells, to pharmaceutical 
preparations containing these compounds, to dosage 
units of such preparations, and to their use in the treatment 
and prophylaxis of hyperparathyroidism, particularly 
secondary hyperparathyroidism associated with renal failure, 
and a number of disease states including diabetes 
mellitus, hypertension, acne, alopecia, skin ageing, imbalance 
in the immune system, inflammatory diseases such as 
rheumatoid arthritis and asthma as well as diseases characterized 
by abnormal cell differentiation and/or cell proliferation 
such as e.g. psoriasis and cancer, and for promoting 
osteogenesis and treating osteoporosis. The compounds of the invention constitute a novel 
class of vitamin D analogues and are represented by the 
general formula I 
 
in which formula X is hydrogen or hydroxy; R1 and R2, which 
may be the same or different, stand for hydrogen or a  
 
C1-C6 hydrocarbyl radical; or R1 and R2, taken together 
with the carbon atom (starred in formula I) bearing the 
group X, can form a C3-C8 carbocyclic ring; R3 stands for 
hydrogen or a C1-C10 hydrocarbyl radical or for YR4, in 
which Y stands for the radicals -CO-, -CO-O-, -CO-S-, 
-CS-, -CS-O-, -CS-S-, -SO- or -SO2-, and R4 stands for 
hydrogen or a C1-C10 hydrocarbyl radical; Q is a single 
bond or a C1-C8 hydrocarbylene diradical. R1, R2, R3 and/or 
Q may be optionally substituted with one or more deuterium 
or fluorine atoms. In the context of this invention, the expression 
hydrocarbyl radical (hydrocarbylene diradical) indicates 
the residue after removal of 1 (2) hydrogen atom(s) from a 
straight, branched or cyclic saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbon. Examples of R1 and R2 when taken separately include 
(apart from hydrogen), but are not limited to, methyl, trifluoromethyl, 
ethyl, vinyl, normal-, iso- and cyclo-propyl, 
and 1-methylvinyl. Examples of R1 and R2 when taken together include 
di-, tri-, tetra- and penta-methylene. Examples of R3 and R4 include (apart from hydrogen), 
but are not limited to, methyl, trifluoromethyl, ethyl, 
propyl, normal-, iso- and cyclopropyl, normal-, iso-, sec-, 
and tert-butyl, normal- and iso-pentyl, phenyl and benzyl. Examples of Q include a single bond, methylene, di-, 
tri- and tetra-methylene, -CH2-CH=CH-,
