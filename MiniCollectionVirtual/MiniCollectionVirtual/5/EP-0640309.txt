<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a suspension device for suspending
and lighting prints, paintings and other objects to
be exposed to view.The invention furthermore relates to a lighting device and
a live conducting rail for use with such a suspension device.The invention further relates to a suspension element for
use with such a suspension device and to a ceiling rail
for arranging a suspension element and/or a lighting
device.Hanging up paintings and the like with the help of a
suspension rail is known
(see FR-A-2 609 323).
The paintings can then be
movably attached to the suspension rail with the help of
suspension elements, which can have the shape of a hook or
a clamping block, and to which, for example, a suspension
wire or suspension rod for the painting can be attached.
For lighting the suspended painting, a lighting device is
attached to the suspension, for example to the clamping
block and/or to the suspension wire.This has the disadvantage that the lighting device cannot
be placed or moved independently of the painting. In addition,
the lighting device applies force to the clamping
block and/or to the suspension wire.Another disadvantage is that the power cable leading to
the lighting device is in view, which, near the painting,
is not such an attractive sight. There is also the possibility 
that when hanging up the painting the cable gets
tangled up with the suspension wire.It is an object of the invention to provide a suspension
device in which the lighting device can be moved independently
of the objects to be exposed to view and in
which the power supply to the lighting device is concealed.
Such a device is disclosed in DE-U-8 813 627.This object is achieved by the suspension device according
to claim 1.With this it is achieved that by means of the conducting
rail the lighting device is movable independently of the
objects to be suspended. On account of the conducting rail
being live, no loose power cables are necessary. With the
help of the clamping means and the tension means the
lighting device can be arranged at every desired place in
the conducting rail, and the tension means will push the
clamping means against the holding means of the conducting
rail, and the contact part of the lighting device against
the conducting strip, so that a good electric contact is
established.A preferred embodiment of the device is described in claim
2. By means of the grip, the clamping plate is easily
inserted at the desired place in the conducting rail,
after which the compression spring, which was somewhat
