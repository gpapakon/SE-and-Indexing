<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a dispensing package, particularly for a pasty cosmetic product in stick form. The package is of the type comprising a hollow body (1, 2), a piston (4) carrying the said product mounted axially movable but immobilised in rotation in the hollow body, a screw (9) for the axial displacement of the said piston and a thumb wheel (13) for driving the screw in rotation. The package is characterised in that the hollow body (1, 2) has a non-circular, advantageously oval, transverse section, in that the means for driving in rotation of the thumb wheel (13) comprise an endless band (33) which is mounted on the lower end of the body (1) displaceable in the direction of the periphery (F1) of the latter, includes on its inner surface projecting elements (36) interacting with the drive elements (31) on the outer surface of the thumb wheel (13) for driving the latter in rotation during displacement of the band, and in that the hollow body comprises, at the level of the drive band (33), openings (38) permitting the engagement of the complementary drive elements (31, 36) of the thumb wheel and of the band. The invention can be used in the field of cosmetic products.

Distributor packing in particular for stick-shaped cosmetic pasty
products, of the type comprising a hollow body (1, 2), a piston (4)

carrying the said product and axially movably mounted but held against
rotation in the hollow body and provided with a threaded portion, a

device for the axial displacement of the said piston, comprising a screw
(9) which extends axially in the body (1, 2) and co-operates with the

threaded portion of the piston and means for rotatably driving the screw,
which comprise a knurled knob (31) made fast to for rotation with the

screw (9), arranged at the level of the lower portion of the hollow body
and carrying on its external surface elements permitting its rotary

driving, the hollow body (1, 2) exhibiting a non-circular advantageously
oval cross-section, characterized in that the means for rotary driving the

knurled knob (13) comprise an endless strip (33) which is mounted onto
the lower end of the body (1) displaceable in the direction of the

periphery (F1) of the latter, comprises on its inner surface projecting
elements (36) co-operating with the drive elements (31) on the external

surface of the knurled knob (13) for rotatably driving the latter during
the displacement of the strip and in that the hollow body comprises at

the level of the drive strip (33) openings (38) permitting the engagement
of the complementary drive elements (31, 36) of the knurled knob and

of the strip.
Packing according to claim 1, characterized in that the hollow body
comprises an external hollow body (1) of cylindrical shape and with a

non-circular cross-section and of which the upper and lower ends are
open and closed (at 40), respectively, and an internal hollow body (2)

with a shape corresponding to that of the external body (1) but of which
the lower portion located at the level of the openings (38) for mutual

engagement of the complementary drive elements (36, 31) of the strip
(33) and of the knurled knob (13) is provided as a cylindrical portion

with a circular cross-section and in that the knurled knob (13), which is 
open at one end and closed at its other end, is fitted in a rotary manner

over the said circular portion (14).
Packing according to claim 2, characterized in that the wall (40) closing
the lower end of the external body (1) comprises a circular recess (39)

permitting the insertion and the fitting of the knurled knob (13) over the
circular portion (14) of the internal body (2).
Packing according to one of claims 2 or 3, characterized in that a
peripheral groove (34) for the guiding of the drive strip (33) is provided

in the external face of the external body (1) at the level of the openings
(38) for mutual engagement of the drive elements of the strip (33) and of

the knurled knob (13).
Packing according to one of claims 2 to 4, characterized in that the
circular portion (14) of the internal body (2) comprises, on its outer face,

small collars (22) which constitute sealing means between the
cylindrical portion (14) and the knurled knob (13).
Packing according to one of the foregoing claims, characterized in that it

comprises a cap (3) for the closing of the packing which exhibits a shape
corresponding to that of the hollow body and is adapted to be fitted over

the upper open end of the latter, in that a strip (42) for the locking of the
cap onto the hollow body is mounted for being displaceable about the

cap in the peripheral direction of the latter, which carries on its internal
face ramp-shaped elements (44) which are adapted to co-operate

through openings (46) in the wall of the cap with ramp-shaped elements
(45) provided on the peripheral surface of the hollow body, so that the

rotary movement of the locking strip (42) causes an axial mouvement of
the cap on the end of the hollow body.
Packing according to claim 6, characterized in that the ramp-shaped
elements (44, 45) exhibit each one the configuration of an L and 

inclined portions to permit the engagement, the rotation and the locking
of the cap (3) with and onto the hollow body.
