<ABSTRACT>
The present invention involves assay methods and devices for performing binding assays, wherein the detectable label is a magnetically responsive material. Direct and indirect, competitive and sandwich assay formats are used to partition the magnetically attractable label between a solid phase and a fluid phase in proportion to the presence or amount of analyte in the test sample. The magnetic responsiveness of the magnetically attractable label in one or both phases results in the exertion of a force upon the label. By determining the extent of the force or influence of the force exerted upon the label, the amount of the analyte in the test sample is determined.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for determining the presence of analyte in
a test sample using a detectable label attached to a binding member. In particular,
the invention relates to the use of magnetically attractable materials as the
detectable label.Diagnostic assays have become an indispensable means for detecting analytes
in test samples by using the mutual reaction between the anatyte and a specific
binding member, as typified by the immunoreaction between an antigen and the
antibody to that antigen. In detecting binding reactions, use has been made of
detectable tags or labels attached to antibodies, which in turn bind to the analytes of
interest. The detection of the resultant labeled antibody/analyte complex, or of the
labeled antibody which remains unbound, is used to indicate the presence or amount
of the analyte in the test sample.Two commonly used binding assay techniques are the radioimmunoassay
(RIA) and the enzyme immunoassay (EIA), both of which employ a labeled binding
member. The RIA uses a radioactive isotope as the traceable substance attached to a
binding member. Because the radioactive isotope can be detected in very small
amounts, it can be used to detect or quantitate small amounts of analyte. There are,
however, a number of substantial drawbacks associated with the RIA. These
drawbacks include the special facilities and extreme caution that are required in
handling radioactive materials, the high costs of such reagents and their unique
disposal requirements.The EIA uses an enzyme as the label attached to a binding member, and
enzymatic activity is used to detect the immunoreaction. While the EIA does not have
the same disadvantages as the RIA, EIA techniques typically require the addition of
substrate materials to elicit the detectable enzyme reaction. Enzyme substrates are
also often unstable and have to be prepared just prior to use or be stored under
refrigeration. In addition, enzyme labels may be difficult to purify and conjugate to
binding members, and may be unstable during storage at room temperature. Enzyme 
immunoassays are also unsatisfactory in that the methods typically require complex
incubations, multiple liquid additions and multiple wash steps.More recently, assay techniques using metallic sol particles as visual labels
have been developed. In these techniques, a metal (e.g., gold, silver, platinum), a
metal compound, or a nonmetallic substance coated with a metal or a metal compound
is used to form an aqueous dispersion of particles. Generally, the binding
