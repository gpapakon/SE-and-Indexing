<ABSTRACT>
An intraluminal prosthesis (40) is provided with a plurality of annular elements. Each annular element includes a plurality of struts (42, 44) and apices (46) connected to form an annular configuration. Each annular element has a compressed state and an expanded state, and has a longitudinal dimension which is smaller in the expanded state than in the compressed state. A plurality of connecting members (48) connect the apices of adjacent annular elements. The connecting members have a plurality of alternating segments that function to compensate for the smaller longitudinal dimension of each annular element in the expanded state. The stent may be provided with varying flexibility along its length and/or circumference, and may include segments that have different diameters.

<DESCRIPTION>
 NON-FORESHORTENING INTRALUMINAL PROSTHESIS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to an intraluminal prosthesis for implantation into a mammalian vessel, and in particular, to an intraluminal stent that is delivered in a compressed state to a specific location inside the lumen of a mammalian vessel and then deployed to an expanded state to support the vessel. The intraluminal stent is provided with a structural configuration that maintains the prosthesis at substantially the same length in both the compressed and expanded states. The intraluminal stent may also be provided with varying rigidity or flexibility along its length.2. Description of the Prior Art Intraluminal prosthesis, such as stents, are commonly used in the repair of aneurysms, as liners for vessels, or to provide mechanical support to prevent the collapse of stenosed or occluded vessels. These stents are typically delivered in a compressed state to a specific location inside the lumen of a vessel or other tubular structures, and then deployed at that location of the lumen to an expanded state. The stent has a diameter in its expanded state which is several times larger than the diameter of the stent in its compressed state. These stents are also frequently deployed in the treatment of atherosclerotic stenosis in blood vessels, especially after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) procedures, to improve the results of the procedure and to reduce the likelihood of restenosis. 

 The positioning of a stent at the desired location in the lumen of a body vessel is a critical factor that affects the performance of the stent and the success of the medical procedure. Since the region in a lumen at which the stent is to be deployed is usually very difficult for a physician to access, it is essential that the stent 's deployed diameter and length be known before the physician can accurately position a stent with the correct size at the precise location. For example, since the diameter and the length of the diseased or damaged segment or region of the body vessel can vary for different body vessels, disease states, and deployment purposes, it is important that a stent having the precise diameter and length be delivered to this region for deployment. Careful sizing of this region of the lumen of the body vessel may pose a difficult challenge for many physicians who know the exact dimensions of the body vessel at this region, but are not certain about the stent 's deployed diameter and
