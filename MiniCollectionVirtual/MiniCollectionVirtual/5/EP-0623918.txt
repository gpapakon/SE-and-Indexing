<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic layer is formed on a non-magnetic substrate through a non-ferromagnetic layer. This non-ferromagnetic layer 
contains spherical, non-ferromagnetic fine granular iron oxide. Alternatively, it contains non-structural carbon having a mean 

grain size of 10 to 60 nm, a specific surface area of up to 150 cm²/g by a BET method and a DBP oil absorption quantity of up 
to 100 ml/100 g in addition to, or in place of, this iron oxide. In this way, a magnetic recording medium having excellent 

surface property and electromagnetic conversion characteristics can be accomplished.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a coated type of magnetic
recording medium.In magnetic recording media represented by high-performance
audio cassette tapes, various video tapes, DATs and diverse
magnetic discs there is now left much to be desired in terms of
high-density recording. To make high-density recording possible,
for instance, it has been proposed to use magnetic metal powders as
a magnetic powder material, and this is now put to practical use.To achieve high-density recording, on the other hand, media
must be fabricated while taking their thickness and self-demagnetizing
losses into account and the magnetic layers are
required to be thinned from this point-of-view. With a thin
magnetic layer, however, the surface properties of the base or
substrate are reflected on the magnetic layer, often causing the
electromagnetic transducing characteristics to be adversely
affected. For this reason, it has so far been put forward to
provide on the surface of a substrate a nonmagnetic layer in which,
for instance, thermosetting resin is used as a binder, and provide
a magnetic layer with the nonmagnetic layer interposed between it
and the substrate. However, a grave problem with this nonmagnetic
layer is that its durability is less than satisfactory. In the medium arrangement mentioned above, the magnetic layer
is formed on the previously coated and dried nonmagnetic layer.
Although depending on the binder resin used, this causes the
surface properties of the magnetic layer to be adversely affected
by the surface properties of the nonmagnetic layer.To solve this problem, JP-A-63-191315 and 63-191318 disclose
the so-called wet-on-wet procedure in which a nonmagnetic undercoat
having magnetic powders dispersed in a binder of, e.g.,
thermoplastic resin, is provided, and this undercoat and a magnetic
layer are superposed on each other while both the coating solutions
remain wet. The examples of both the specifications teach that α-Fe2O3
is used as the nonmagnetic powders, but this α-Fe2O3 appears
to be in an acicular form. They also state that such arrangements
enable the electromagnetic transducing characteristics, durability
and head wear losses to be improved.In the case of magnetic recording media such as video tapes and
floppy discs (FDs) that are used on a digital recording mode,
however, it is required to make the magnetic layers much thinner in
association with high-density recording. Thus, since the surface
properties of even media obtained with such nonmagnetic layers as
set forth in the
