<ABSTRACT>
In a method of detecting the spatial position of a 
laser beam relative to a body locatable in the path of the 

laser beam by detecting an acoustic signal produced by the 
beam in the body, wherein the laser beam carries a power 

modulation signal and the body has a plurality of acoustic 
sensors for detecting the acoustic signal produced in the 

body by the laser beam, the method includes detecting in 
the outputs of the acoustic sensors signals corresponding 

to the power modulation of the incident laser beam and 
detecting any difference in phase between the detected 

signals. A processor may be provided for processing the 
outputs of the acoustic sensors, the processor including 

means for sensing in the respective outputs signals 
corresponding to the power modulation of the output beam 

of the laser and a phase sensitive detector for detecting 
differences in phase between the detected signals. There 

may be at least three acoustic sensors whereby the spatial 
position of the laser beam may be detected in two 

dimensions. 
The invention has particular applicability in systems, 

eg for use in remotely controlled operations, in which a 
laser beam is to be guided to a point of application via a 

series of beam steering mirrors. Errors in the detected 
positions of the beam relative to the mirrors may be 

employed to control the positions of the mirrors.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus and a
method for detecting the position of a laser beam.In systems employing laser beams it is desirable in
some applications to be able to change the direction of
the beam using one or more mirrors. In some cases it is
necessary to be able to measure the position of the beam
accurately relative to a datum point on the mirror.Previously reported research has shown that acoustic
waves are produced when a laser beam is incident upon a
mirror employed to deflect the beam. These signals have
been attributed to thermal absorption in a thin surface of
the mirror. Owing to thermal expansion a pressure is
exerted in the surrounding area. The thermal energy is
deposited so rapidly by the beam that the adjacent
material has no time to relax, and hence quench the
acoustic wave. The laser beam thus acts as a source of
elastic waves on the surface of the mirror.It has been suggested in the prior art that the
acoustic signal produced by a laser beam in a reflector
may be used to detect characteristics of
the beam such as beam power or beam size and position. For example, prior
patent application GB 2158942A describes such an
arrangement in which the acoustic signal is proposed to be
picked up by one or a plurality of electromechanical transducers mounted on a
beam reflector.According to the present invention there is provided a
method of detecting the spatial position of a laser beam
relative to a body located in the path of the beam by
detecting an acoustic signal produced by the beam in the
said body, wherein the laser beam carries a power
modulation signal and the body has a plurality of acoustic
sensors for detecting the acoustic signal produced in the 
body by the laser beam, the method including detecting in
the outputs of the acoustic sensors signals corresponding
to the power modulation of the incident laser beam,
detecting any difference in phase between the detected
signals and using the differences in phase to detect the spatial position of the laser beam relative to a datum point on the body.According to the present invention in a second aspect
there is provided an apparatus for detecting the position
of a laser beam relative to a body locatable in the path
of the laser beam, including a laser having in use an
output beam carrying a power modulation signal, a body
locatable in the path of the laser beam the body having a
plurality of acoustic sensors for detecting an acoustic
signal produced by the laser beam in the body and a
processor for processing the
