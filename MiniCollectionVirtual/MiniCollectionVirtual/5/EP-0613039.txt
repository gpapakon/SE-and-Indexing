<ABSTRACT>
A method of filling an electrochemichromic device 
comprises providing the device with a filling aperture 

and evacuating it, lowering the device into an 
electrochemichromic solution and exposing the 

electrochemichromic solution to an inert gas at a 
pressure above that of the inside of the evacuated device 

to cause the solution to enter the device. The aperture 
in the device is then sealed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of at
least partially filling an electrochemichromic device.
Such devices are designed to either colour or clear,
depending on desired application, under the influence of
applied voltage.Patent Abstracts of Japan, 8:188(P-297), 29th August
1984 (JP-A-59/077415) refers to electrochromic display
devices which use methylsulpholane in an electrolyte.EP-A-0240226 refers to image display apparatus
containing a solution of a reversibly reducible organic
substance.Such devices have been suggested for use as
rearview mirrors in automobiles such that in night
driving conditions, application of a voltage would
darken a solution contained in a cell incorporated into
the mirror (U.S. Patent 3,280,701, October 25, 1966).
Similarly, it has been suggested that windows
incorporating such cells could be darkened to block out
sunlight, and then allowed to lighten again at night.
Electrochemichromic cells have been used as display
devices and have been suggested for use as antidazzle
and fog-penetrating devices in conjunction with motor
vehicle headlamps (British Patent Specification 328017,
May 15, 1930).United States Patent 4,090,782 to Bredfeldt

anodic and cathodic electrochromically colouring
components which provide self-erasing, high colour
contrast, single compartment cells. Such anodic and
cathodic coloring components comprise redox couples
selected to exhibit the following reaction:

The redox couple is selected such that the equilibrium
position of the mixture thereof lies completely to the
left of the equation. At rest potential, the
anodically colouring reductant species RED1, and the
cathodically colouring oxidant species OX2 are
colourless. To cause a colour change, voltage is
applied and the normally colourless RED1 is anodically
oxidized to its coloured antipode OX1, while,
