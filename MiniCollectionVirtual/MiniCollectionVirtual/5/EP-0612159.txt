<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the efficient information coding of
digital audio signals for transmission or digital storage media.Compression algorithms for wide band audio signals are finding
wide-spread applications in recent years. In the area of consumer
electronics, the digital compact cassette (DCC) and the mini-disc
system (MD) are two applications of these compression algorithms.
While the DCC system uses a compression algorithm that is based on
subband coding, the MD system uses an algorithm that is based on a
hybrid of subband and transform coding with the transform coding
portion forming the backbone of the algorithm. This invention is
related to the quantization in the MD coder.The MD system uses the ATRAC compression algorithm that is
documented in chapter 10 of the MD system description by Sony in
December 1991. The ATRAC algorithm compresses the input audio signals
at a bit rate of 705.6 k bit/s/channel to a bit rate of 146.08 
k bit/s/channel.Fig. 5 shows the block diagram of the encoding process. The input
time signals are first passed through a splitting filter bank, 1, 2, 3,
to obtain the signals in three frequency bands. The lower two bands
are each at half the bandwidth of the uppermost band. Block size
decision, 4, is made for each band to determine the sample size or
block mode for the windowing and transform process, 5, 6, 7. One of
the two block modes available - short block mode or long block mode,
will be selected for each of the bands. The transformed spectral
samples are grouped into units and in each unit, a scale factor is
derived from the peak values of the samples in the unit, 8. These
units are non-uniform frequency intervals with a closer interval in
the low frequencies and a wider interval in the higher frequencies.
Quantization, 10, is carried out on the samples using the scale factor
and bit allocation information from the dynamic bit allocation module,
9.The quantizer used in the prior art is a uniform midtread quantizer.
The relationship between the original spectral sample (ASD) and the
quantized spectral sample (AS) is given by: 
AS[m] = Trunc{ASD[m]SF[n] (2WL[n]-1-1) + 0.5}   if ASD[m]≧0
AS[m] = Trunc{ASD[m]SF[n] (2WL[n]-1-1) - 0.5}   if ASD[m]<0
where m is the sample index, SF[n] is the scale factor value at unit n
and WL[n] is the word length or bit allocation at unit n. Trunc{x}
means discarding the digits after the decimal point irregardless of
the sign of x. The meaning of the "unit" is described as follows.The audio signal is transformed into ,for example ,
