<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a device for fixing an electronic component (11) on to a flexible printing circuit (14). This device particularly includes a support means (13) equipped with a plurality of openings (15, 16) suitable for receiving the fixing leads (12) of the component to be fixed. At least two of the openings (16) have a cross-section substantially equal to that of the leads (12). The other openings (15) have a cross-section which is substantially greater. The support means is integral with a casing, and is arranged between the flexible circuit (14) and the component to be fixed (11). The leads of the component to be fixed are inserted into the openings (15, 16) of the support means. These fixing leads are also inserted into orifices (22) of the flexible circuit (14). The end of the leads (12), extending from the flexible circuit, is soldered to the lower face of the flexible circuit (14). The present invention also relates to a housing including such a device.

Device for fastening an electronic component (11) 
to a flexible circuit (14), the component being furnished 

with fastening lugs (12) having a specified cross-section 
and the flexible circuit (14) being set in place at least 

partially in a casing (21), the said device being characterized 
in that it is composed of
 
   a support means (13) secured to the casing (21), 

placed between the component (11) to be fastened and the 
flexible circuit (14), the said support means (13) being 

furnished with a plurality of apertures (15, 16), at 
least two (16) of which have a cross-section substantially 

equal to that of the lugs of the component to be 
fastened whilst the others have a cross-section substantially 

greater than that of the fastening lugs (12). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the two apertures (16) with cross-sections substantially 

equal to that of the fastening lugs are adapted to 
receive fastening lugs arranged diagonally on the component 

(11) to be fastened. 
Device according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the support means (13) has a recess (17) adapted 

to receive, at least partially, the component to be 
fastened. 
Device according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the support means (13) includes at least one stiffening 

rib (19) made at the periphery of the recess (17). 
Device according to Claim 3 or 4, characterized 
in that at least one knurl (18) is made at the internal 

periphery of the recess (17).  
 
Casing for an electronic device, of the type 
including at least one electronic component (11) to be 

fastened to a flexible circuit, the said component having 
a plurality of fastening lugs (12) with specified cross-sections, 

the said casing being characterized in that it 
includes: 


the flexible circuit (14) placed in the casing, 
and adapted so as to be connected to a plurality of 

electronic components (23), furnished with fastening lugs 
penetrating through the flexible circuit and welded to a 

lower face thereof, and having a plurality of orifices 
(22) with a cross-section greater than that of the lugs 

(12) and adapted so as to receive the lugs of the component 
to be fastened, and 
a support means (13), placed between the 
flexible circuit and the component to be fastened, the 

said support means being secured to the casing and 
including a plurality of apertures (15, 16), of which at 

least two apertures (16) have cross-sections substantially 
equal to those of the lugs of the component to be 

fastened whilst the others have a cross-section which is 
substa
ntially greater than those of the fastening lugs 
(12).
