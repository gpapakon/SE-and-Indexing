<ABSTRACT>
A packing box (case/carton) constructed from sheet material, such as corrugated cardboard, comprises a base (10), side structure walls (12) and foldable flap members (1 and 2) with slits forming slots (3), tongues (4), or combined slot/tongues (3+4) and which incorporate creased bending lines (5), and/or slit bending lines (16 or 17), with creased and perforated bending lines (7) forming ledges (8), when folded with creased bending lines (13), and closure lide flaps (9). When flaps (1 and 2) are folded so that they are in contact with the article surface and engaged within the box, a thin walled structure is created within the void space between an article, less in height than the side structure wall height, and closure lid. This enables the article to be restrained from excessive movement or to enable the separation of articles during handling, transportation and storage.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DescriptionIntegral Packing BoxTechnical FieldThis invention relates to a packing box (case/ carton) used for containing articles and is constructed from sheet material, such as corrugated cardboard, and which comprises a base, side wall structure and at least one hinged, foldable flap.The more common methods of packing levels of articles that will vary, from box to box, are by either the use of boxes specifically designed to suit the article level, or by using extraneous packing material to fill the void space between the article surface and closure lid.These methods of packing levels of articles that will vary, can be relatively expensive and relies upon the availability and storage of either a variety of box heights or bulky void filling material, otherwise packing may not be adequately achieved.Packing methods developed to reduce cost, to be more convenient in use and reduce packaging storage space, range from the use of technology, in the form of specialised equipment, to the redesign of the packing box, in the sense of incorporating a form of packing material.Background ArtU.S. Patent No. 3,313,467 indicates a box formed into a rectangular shape from a piece of cardboard and comprises a base, side wall structure, and hinged, foldable flaps that are .scored with a plurality of lines and which are vertically slotted to enable packing levels of articles that will vary. 

 When the article level is above the side wall structure height, the flap score lines are folded to correspond with the height, so that they are in contact with the article surface. When the article level is below the side wall structure height, opposing flaps are folded into square type sections, by manipulation of convenient score lines, so that one surface of the square section is in contact with the article surface. The remaining flaps are then folded to rest upon the top of the square sections.The flaps are secured into the article retaining position by the use of adhesive tape applied to the outer surface of the flaps and side wall structure.Disclosure of InventionAccording to the present invention, a packing box (case/ carton) comprising a base, a side wall structure and at least one flap, detachable or not, that will fold inside to engage the surface of the article contained within and engage with another part of the box, such that the article is restrained.The advantages being that if the article level is the same or less than the height of the side wall structure, the majority of the void between the article surface and

 Clai s
1. A packing box comprising a base, a side wall structure and at least one flap, the flap having an edge connected with the side wall structure and a free edge and being arranged to fold, in one sense of rotation, into the box about its connection with the side wall structure, characterised in that the flap has at least one line of weakness between the said edges about which it yields, generally in the other sense of rotation of the edges relative to one another, when the flap engages the surface of an article contained within the box, such that the flap is foldable between an open position in which the article is held within the box, the said one flap being held in the article retaining position by its engagement with another part of the box.
2. A packing box as claimed in claim 1 including a pair of generally opposed flaps which both have lines of weakness and are foldable into article retaining positions to engage the surface of articles stored within the box, each flap having means for engaging the other flap in the respective article retaining positions.
3. A packing box as claimed in claim 2 in which each flap has a plurality of lines of weakness between the edge connected with the side wall structure and the free edge, the lines of weakness extending generally parallel to the connection between the side wall structure and the flap.
4. A packing box as claimed in claim 2 in which the lines of weakness on one flap are coincident with the means for engaging the other flap. 


5. A packing box as claimed in claim 3 in which the means for engaging a series of slits or openings between the said edges of the flap which slits or openings will be engaged by projections formed in the opposite flap when the flaps are in the article retaining positions, the height of the upper surface of the article within the box determining the election of the opening and projection for engagement.
6- A packing box as claimed in claim 5 in which the slits define the -pro ections, which projections are deformable out of the general plane of one flap to enter a slit in the other flap.
7. A packing box as claimed in claim 6 in which the projections are tongues defined by the slits in the flaps.
8. A packing box as claimed in claim 2 in which slits providing intermittent lines of weakness, will deform into shapes providing resistance to folding the flap to angles of 90 degrees or less along the said lines of weakness.
9. A Packing box as claimed in claim 1 in which at least one flap is detachable to engage the surface of an article contained within the box such that the flap is held in the article retaining position by the flap engagement with another part of the box.
10- A packing box as claimed in claim 1 in which at least one flap will engage with material added to the box, such that the article within the box is held in a retaining position within the box. 


11. A packing box as claimed in claim 1 comprising at least one lid connected with the side wall structure which lid is foldable over the flap in the article retaining position to close the box.
12. A packing box as claimed in claim 8, including mutually opposed lids having depending lips which are receivable in a slot in the flap in the closed position of the lids.
13. A packing box as claimed in claim 1 in which the flap is foldable *about both its connection with the side wall structure and a further fold region of the flap such that the flap projects into the box in the article retaining position spaced from the side wall structure.
14. A packing box as claimed in claim 1 which is constructed from unitary cut and scored blank of sheet material.
