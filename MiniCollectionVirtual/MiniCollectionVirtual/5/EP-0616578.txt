<ABSTRACT>
An inflator (110) comprising: a pressure means (12, 14, 16, 20) for storing a quantity of stored inflation gas under pressure. The pressure means comprising a first burst disk (46) in communication with the stored inflation gas and preventing egress of the gas from the chamber and a hollow sliding piston (172) having at one end thereof cutting edges (174) for puncturing the first burst disk (46). A shear disk (180) having a stationary outer portion (187) and a central or inner portion (186), the central portion is secured to one end of the piston (172) opposite the cutting edges (174). The central portion is capable of separating from the outer portion and moving with the piston (172). The central portion also functions as a second disk. A quantity of propellant material (218) is provided near the second burst disk (80) to produce gaseous combustion products when burned. The piston is propelled into the first burst disk (46) after the central portion (186) of the shear disk separates from the outer portion in response to the build up of pressure generated due to the burning of a propellant (218), thereby permitting the egress of the stored inflation gas. The central portion (186) or second burst disk is ruptured by the continued build up of pressure due to the burning propellant material whereupon after the rupturing of the second burst disk the heated products of combustion resulting from the burning propellant material flow through the sliding piston (172) to increase the temperature of the stored inflation gas prior to its exit from the inflator.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to an 
inflator for an air bag or cushion and more 
specifically to the type of inflator known as a 
hybrid inflator. It is known that if the early inflation rate of 
an air bag is too high, the resulting deployment 
forces can contribute to the possible injury of an 
occupant who is out of the normal seated (either 
driver or passenger) position. If, however, the air 
bag inflation rate is maintained at a relatively low 
value, primarily to reduce such deployment forces, 
full deployment of the air bag may not be timely 
achieved. It has for some time been appreciated that one 
goal of air bag inflator design is to provide an 
inflator which initially has a relatively low or soft 
inflation rate (for a relatively few milliseconds) 
primarily to protect the out-of-position passenger, 
such as a standing child, who would be subject to 
large deployment forces and thereafter to rapidly 
increase the inflation rate of the air bag to cause 
rapid and full inflation. The prior art shows 
techniques for achieving this staged (bi-level) 
inflation of an air bag by utilizing an inflator 
which is capable of producing inflation gases with at 
least a low and a higher rate of gas production. 
With regard to air bag inflators generally, whether  
 
they are of the hybrid or stored gas variety or of 
the solid propellant (typically sodium azide) variety 
is the inclusion of an initiator or squib and a mass 
of gas producing or propellant material. As is known 
in the art and in response to a crash signal, the 
squib (or initiator) is activated which in turn 
causes the propellant material to burn. In the case 
of a hybrid inflator the purpose of the propellant 
material is to heat the stored inflation gas thereby 
increasing the effective, released volume of same 
while also increasing the rate of egress of the 
inflation gases from a pressure tank. In this case 
heated, stored gas is the primary source of inflation 
gases. In the solid propellant type of inflator, the 
squib causes the propellant to burn, the purpose of 
which is to generate a relatively inert, large volume 
of inflation gases. In order to achieve the above-mentioned staged, 
variable inflation rate for an inflator, the prior 
art has proposed using a plurality of detonating 
devices to sequentially open restricted and 
unrestricted flow paths (see United States Patent 
3,741,580). Another type of device for generating 
the staged inflation has been proposed in United 
States Patent 3,774,807, wherein upon

   a pressure means (12,14,16,20) for storing a 

quantity of stored inflation gas under pressure, the 
pressure means comprising a first burst disk (46) in 

communication with the stored inflation gas and 
preventing egress of the gas from the chamber,
 
   a sliding piston (72, 172) including at one end 

thereof first means (174) for puncturing the first burst 
disk (46),
 
   a shear disk (180) having a stationary outer 

portion (187) and a central or inner portion (186) the 
central portion secured to one end of the piston (172) 

opposite the first means (174), the central portion 
capable of separating from the outer portion and moving 

with the piston (172), the central portion functioning as 
a second burst disk;
 
   propellant material (90) provided near the 

second burst disk (80), said propellant producing gaseous 
combustion products when burned;
 
   the piston being propelled into the first 

burst disk (46) after the central portion (186) of the 
shear disk separates from the outer portion (187) in response 

to the build up of pressure generated due to the burning 
of propellant material 218, thereby permitting the egress 

of the stored inflation gas, the central portion (186) or 
second burst disk being ruptured by the continued build 

up of pressure due to the burning propellant material 
whereupon after the rupturing of the second burst disk 

the heated products of combustion resulting from the 
burning propellant material flow past the sliding piston 

(172) to increase the temperature of the stored inflation 
gas prior to its exit from the inflator. 
The inflator (10) as defined in Claim 1 
wherein the pressure means (12) comprises a cylindrical 

sleeve (14), a first end cap (16) secured at one end (14)  
 

thereof and a second end cap (20) secured at another end 
(18) thereof, the second end cap (20) being of generally 

cylindrical shape and including a narrowed portion (40) 
extending into the sleeve (14), the narrowed portion 

defining a first opening (44), the first burst disk (46) 
being secured to the narrow portion to close the first 

opening (44), the second end cap (20) further including 
at least one orifice opening (226) through which gases 

escape upon the puncturing of the first burst disk (46). 
The inflator as defined in Claim 1 wherein a 
propellant housing (52) is positioned with and generally 

spaced from the interior of the second end cap (20), the 
housing (52) including a second opening (54) facing the 

first burst disk (46).

housing (52) and extends through the second opening (54), 
the sliding piston (172) is received within the sleeve 

member (160) and wherein the outer portion of the shear 
disk is secured to the sleeve member. 
The inflator (110) as defined in Claim 3 wherein 
the shear disk (180) includes a stress riser (184) 

between the outer portion and central portion, the stress 
riser (184) providing a weakened region along with the 

central portion separates from the outer portion. 
The inflator (110) as defined in Claim 4 wherein 
the shear disk (180) includes a second stress riser 

located within the central portion (186) defining a 
weakened region therein, the central portion or second 

burst disk opening along this region at a determinable 
pressure to allow the products of combustion of the 

burning propellant to mix with the stored inflation gas. 
The inflator as defined in Claim 1 wherein the 
piston (172) and sleeve member (160) cooperate to provide  

 
an interference fit therebetween when the piston has 

moved to its burst disk piercing position, thereby 
preventing the piston from being moved backwardly by the 

escaping inflation gas. 
The inflator (10) as defined in Claim 1 wherein 
the sliding piston (172) is hollow and the heated 

products of combination flow through the sliding piston 
to the pressure means.
