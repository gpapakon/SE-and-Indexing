<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a rotary joint for
fluids, that is a device used to transmit a pressurised fluid
from a fixed part to a rotating one while preventing spilling of
the fluid through proper seals or gaskets.A rotary joint generally comprises a fixed part named
stator or body, and a rotary or rotatable part named rotor. Such
rotary joint may be provided either with only one passage (or
way), or with two or more passages independent from each other,
according to the required applications in a plant.More particularly, the rotary joint of the present
invention is of the type comprising two independent passages
each comprising two (axial or radial) inlet ports provided in
the stator, and one axial outlet port and one radial outlet port
in the rotor. Joints of this type are generally fitted to the
bottom of oleodynamic or pneumatic cylinders of take-up reels of
metal sheets.The two ways are used to drive the cylinder, i. e. one
way is used for the rod extension and the other for retracting
the rod, respectively.Two examples of rotary joints of this type, with an
axial outlet port 21 and a radial outlet port 22, are described
in the partially cross-sectioned side views of Figures 3 and 4.
The body 10 of the joint includes two inlets 11 and 12,
connected to the outlets 21 and 22 respectively, with the body
being further secured to the cylinder (not shown in the Figures) 
by means of a mounting on the cylinder bottom.The known devices of this type show an inconvenience due
to fact that the joint rotor has to be threaded for being
connected to the cylinder bottom, and therefore it is not always
posssible to obtain a desired angular arrangement, after the
parts have been tightened together. This inconvenience is
particularly felt in the joint maintenance operations, for
example when replacement of the joint is needed.It is an an object of present invention to overcome the
above mentioned drawback, and particularly to provide a two-way
rotary joint having a radial outlet port that allows a
positioning thereof according to any given or desired direction.According to the invention, this object is accomplished
by means of a rotary joint provided with the characteristics
recited in claim 1.Further advantageous characteristics are recited in the
dependent claims.The invention will now be disclosed with reference to
the attached drawings illustrating preferred non-limiting
embodiments thereof, in which:
Figures 1 and 2 are partially cross-sectioned side views
illustrating two embodiments of a rotary joint
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A two-way rotary joint for fluids comprising a main body
(10) provided with a first (1) and a second (2) inlet ports, and a

rotor (3) rotatably coupled to said main body (10) and provided
with a locking threaded end portion (13), said rotor (3)

comprising an axial outlet port (12, 21) connected to said first
inlet port (1) and at least a second outlet port which is an intermediate radial outlet port (22)

connected to said second inlet port (2), 
characterized in that

said intermediate radial outlet port (22) is angularly orientable independently
from the rotation of said rotor (3).
A joint as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 both
said inlet ports (1, 2) are radially extending ports.
A joint as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 that
both said inlet ports (1, 2) are axially extending ports.
A joint as claimed in the preceding claims, 
characterized
in that
 a rotatable ring-shaped hub (9) is fitted to said rotor
(3) through sealing means (5), said ring-shaped hub (9) being

provided with an annular channel (8) and with a radial outlet port
(22) communicating with each other, said annular channel (8)

further communicating, through a radial hole (7) in said rotor
(3), with one of said inlet ports (1, 2).
A joint as claimed in claim 4, 
characterized in that
 said
rotor (3) is provided with two axial ducts (11, 12) one of which

communicates with said annular channel (8), while the other is
closed by a plug (6).
A joint as claimed in claim 4, 
characterized in that
 said 
rotor (3) is provided with an axial duct (21) and an annular

chamber (14), this latter being in communication with said annular
channel (8).
A joint as claimed in claim 4, 
characterized in that
 said
rotor (3) is provided with a threaded portion (13), and that said

annular hub (9) is mounted far from said threaded portion (13),
with a spacer (4) inserted between said hub (9) and said body (10)

of the joint to prevent any axial displacement thereof.
A joint as claimed in claim 4. 
characterized in that
 said
rotor (3) is provided with a threaded portion (13) and that said

annular hub (9) is assembled near said threaded portion (13).
A joint as claimed in the preceding claims, 
characterized
in that
 said sealing means (5) include gaskets having circular
cross-section and located in seats formed between said hub (9) and

said rotor (3).
A joint as claimed the preceding claims, 
characterized in
that
 said sealing means include gaskets (15) having a flat cross-section.
