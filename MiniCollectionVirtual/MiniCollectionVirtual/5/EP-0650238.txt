<ABSTRACT>
A coil winding machine has at least one integrated stripping/wire guide unit which contains a stripping head (20) which is connected to a hollow drive cylinder (21). Three tilting levers (26), which are fitted with cutting tools (blades 28), are mounted in the stripping head such that they can pivot, are pressed by flyweights (29) against the wire (40), which passes through between them, when the stripping head is rotating, and remove the insulation from said wire (40). An adjusting spindle (23) passes through the hollow drive cylinder (21), is fitted at its outer end with a scale ring (25) and, at its other end, engages in the thread of a stop screw (24) which can be displaced in the axial direction by rotation of the adjusting spindle and forms a stop for the conically running tilting lever (26). The movement of the tilting lever is limited earlier or later depending on the position of the stop screw, so that the stripping blades can be set exactly to the wire thickness.

Device for stripping varnish-insulated or 
plastic-insulated round wires (40) by means of an 

insulation stripper, having at least three material-removing 
cutting tools which are mounted in a stripping 

head, can be activated, rotate around the wire when 
driven by a motor (14), and can be adjusted to 

correspond to the respective wire diameter, and having 
wire guides (30) that are provided for winding an 

electric coil, the insulation stripper, together with 
the wire guides, being combined on a common carrier to 

form in each case art integrated stripping/wire-guiding 
unit for each winding point of a coil-winding machine, 

and the motor being arranged at the side of the 
insulation stripper and, together with the latter, 

being mounted on a common mounting plate (51), and 
being connected via a drive belt (16) to a drive 

cylinder (21) for the stripping head (20), 

characterized in that a stop ring (24a), which is 
located centrally between the material-removing cutting 

tools (28) and belongs to a stop screw (24), is 
connected to an adjusting spindle (23) which is 

provided at its other end with a scale ring (25). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the mounting plate (51) is connected via damping 

elements (53) to a carrier part (52). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the drive belt (16) is a toothed belt.  

 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the carrier part (52) has a suction duct (54) that 

is restricted to the region of the stripping head (20).
