<ABSTRACT>
Diglycidyl ether epoxy resins are reacted with a 
prepolymer produced from an organic diisocyanate and a 

bifunctional active hydrogen compound having a soft segment 
whose terminal isocyanate groups have been blocked to 

chain-extend the epoxy resin with the prepolymer. The 
chain-extended epoxy resin is then reacted with a cationic 

active hydrogen compound alone or incombination with an 
aliphatic monoalcohol, alkylphenol, glycol monoether or 

bisphenol to open the terminal epoxy rings of the chain 
extende
d epoxy resin. The modified epoxy resin thus produced 
is dispersed in an aqueous medium containing a neutralizing 

agent together with a crosslinker to give a cathodic 
electrodeposition paint having improved impact strength and 

other properties.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a modified epoxy resin. More 
particulary, it relates to the modified epoxy resin 
containing a soft segment for use as a binder resin of 
cathodic electrodeposition paints. Modified epoxy, resins to be incorporated into cathodic 
electrodeposition paints are conventionally produced by 
reacting a starting epoxy resin with a cationic active 
hydrogen compound such as primary or secondary amines to 
open at least a portion of the epoxy rings with the active 
hydrogen compound in order to introduce a hydrophilic and 
electrically chargeable group into the resin. These resins 
may be thermally cured either by the reaction with an 
external crosslinker such as melamine resins or blocked 
polyisocyanates, or by the self-crosslinking reaction of a 
pendant blocked isocyanato moiety bound to a secondary 
alcoholic hydroxyl group present in the starting epoxy 
resin. Since epoxy resins containing aromatic rings such as 
biphenol epoxy resins generally produce a cured film having 
decreased flexibility, it is known that the flexibility may  
 
be improved by reacting the starting epoxy resin with an 
alkylphenol such as t-butylphenol or nonylphenol; or a 
long-chain fatty acid so that these components are 
introduced into the resin molecule by the ring opening 
reaction of a portion of epoxy rings with these components. 
Modified resins thus produced, however, have a defect that 
the curability thereof is decreased and the curing requires 
relatively high temperatures. Another known approach for improving the flexibility is 
the use of an epoxy, resin having a soft segment in the 
resin molecule. For example, bisphenol epoxy resins may be 
chain extended by the reaction with a bifunctional polyol 
containing the soft segment such as bifunctional polyether 
polyols. This approach has a defect that other performance 
of the cured film and corrosion resistance in particular 
are not satisfactory. It is, therefore, a major object of the present 
invention to provide a novel modified epoxy resin which 
eliminates or ameliorates the defects of known modified 
epoxy resins. This object may be accomplished by incorporating the 
soft segment into the resin molecule through a unique 
chemical linkage. According to the present invention, a 
method is provided for producing a modified epoxy resin  
 
having a soft segment in the middle of resin molecule and a 
plurality of cationic groups at terminals. This method is 
distinguished over the prior art method in that it uses as a 
chain extending
