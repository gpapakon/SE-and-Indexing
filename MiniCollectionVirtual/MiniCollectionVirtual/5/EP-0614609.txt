<ABSTRACT>
For the production of bread snacks, the glutine in the 
bread dough is hydrolysed so that the dough no longer has 

any residual elasticity. 
A sheet obtained by successive rolling of the dough is 
then worked in a pasta-shaping machine to obtain bread 

shaped in the form of butterflies, shells, ears and the 
like.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a method for
the production of bread derivatives; more particularly
the invention concerns bread dough and a method for the
industrial production of bread tit bits and like products
commonly called snacks.By the term: bread derivatives, in the description and in
the claims which follows, it is intended to identify food
products obtained from a bread dough, comprising mainly
flour, water, yeast, salt and possibly edible fats,
sugars, malt extracts and other conventional additives of
this type.By the term "snacks" it is intended to identify edible
products made available in small sizes, which are
attractive, appetizing, and ready to be eaten as such or
in combination with other "snacks", all with full regard
to conventional food standards.It is well known, on the one hand, that the desire for
these particular products (snacks) is ever increasing
and, therewith, there is continual research into new
forms of snacks with new flavours for ever greater 
satisfaction of consumer tastes.On the other hand it is known that, among these tastes in
the food field, the taste of bread, the true bread
flavour, still has a considerable position.As a consequence it has been proposed that snacks should
be produced with a bread flavour, with the use of bread
doughs and reproducing several (very few) bread shapes in
miniature, and this has indeed been brought about.The technique used for this production is based
fundamentally on the shaping of small pieces of dough by
press moulding, essentially by means of a rotary press
process.This technique does not enable production to be carried
out on an industrial scale and, particularly, results in
products being obtained with a squashed and pressed
appearance, that is not always agreeable and not always
acceptable; products with slightly elaborate shapes
cannot be obtained.Other production techniques and other shapes of bread
snacks have not had any success, even when made on a
small scale, artisan level, particularly because of the
toughness and visco-elasticity of the bread doughs. These characteristics are in fact such that, immediately
the dough has been given a particular shape it tends to
return, more or less rapidly and to a greater or lesser
extent, to its original lack of shape.The idea which is at the root of the present invention is
that of providing true bread snacks in more unexpected
shapes which are as different as possible from those in
which bread is currently found, for example, and in
particular, in the shapes
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method for the production of bread snacks on an industrial
scale, including the following operative steps:


- preparing a bread dough comprising gluten containing flour, water
and yeast, having a total moisture content of no more than 33% by weight

of the total weight of the dough,
- partially hydrolysing the gluten in the dough by means of a gluten
hydrolysing agent incorporated in the dough itself,
- resting-fermenting the dough in conditions of controlled
temperature and humidity, characterised in that it comprises the steps of:
- shaping the raised dough by means of machines for shaping pastas
to obtain the corresponding bread snacks,
- baking and drying the snacks.
A method according to claim 1, characterised in that the
hydrolysing agent is a protease.
A method according to anyone of Claims 1 and 2 characterised 
in that the step of partially hydrolysing the gluten is carried out

simultaneously with the fermentation of the dough during the
corresponding rest period.
A method according to Claim 3, characterised in that the steps
of fermenting the dough and partially hydrolysing the gluten therein are

carried out in a controlled environment with a temperature of between
25°C and 35°C and with a relative humidity of between 80% and 85%

over a period of about 4 hours.
A method according to Claim 3, characterised in that the
fermented dough is subjected to a series of successive rolling steps to

obtain a sheet of predetermined thickness, the sheet then being supplied
continuously to a machine for shaping pasta.
A method according to Claim 5, characterised in that the
product leaving the pasta-shaping machine is baked at a temperature of

between 180°C and 220°C over a period of 6 to 8 minutes to obtain the 
corresponding baked bread snacks.
A method according to Claim 6, characterised in that the baked
bread snacks are subsequently dried/desiccated by heat treatment at

130°C-150°C for 10-15 minutes.
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in that the pasta-shaping
machine is a stamping/pinching machine for forming snacks in

the shapes of butterflies.
