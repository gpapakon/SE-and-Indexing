Process for separating off higher hydrocarbons 
from a gas mixture containing these and lower-boiling 

components by rectifying fractionation, in which the gas 
mixture (6) is partially condensed (7; 7') and passed to 

a separation column (9), at the bottom of which a fraction 
(27) rich in higher hydrocarbons is taken off and at 

the top of which a fraction (10) rich in lower-boiling 
components is taken off, the overhead fraction (10) being 

partially condensed (11) and the condensate being added 
as reflux to the top of the separation column (9), 

characterized in that the condensation (7; 7') of the gas 
mixture (6) and the condensation (11) of the overhead 

fraction (10) is effected by indirect heat exchange with 
a refrigerant which comprises a plurality of components 

and is externally circulated (18) and in that the compressed 
refrigerant is separated within the external 

refrigeration circuit (18) into a gaseous (20) and a 
liquid (21) fraction and in that the gaseous fraction 

(20) is cooled and thus condensed in indirect heat 
exchange with the portion (14) which has remained in the 

gaseous state in the condensation of the overhead fraction 
and is then passed for the indirect heat exchange 

(11) with the overhead fraction (10). 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that an intermediate fraction is withdrawn from the 

separation column (9) at a central point, this intermediate 
fraction is at least partially condensed in indirect 

heat exchange with the refrigerant and is passed back 
(29) to the separation column (9).  

 
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the process is carried out with time-variable 

throughput and/or time-variable composition of the gas 
mixture (6) to be separated. 
Process according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the throughput and/or the composition of the gas 

mixture (6) to be separated is measured (30) and the 
throughput of refrigerant in the various condensation 

stages (7; 7', 11, 15, 24) is set (25, 26,; 26a, 26b) as 
a function of this measured value. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that a heat exchanger is used for the 

indirect heat exchange (11) between overhead fraction 
(10) and refrigerant, which heat exchanger is produced 

from a material having high long-term stability against 
mechanical stresses. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that a heat exchanger is used for the 

indirect heat exchange (15) between the portion (14) 
which has remained in the gaseous state in the condensation 

of the overhead fraction and the gaseous fraction 
(20) of the refrigerant, which heat exchanger is produced 

from a material having high long-term stability to 
mechanical stresses. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that a heat exchanger is used for the 

indirect heat exchange (7) between the gas mixture (6) to 
be fractionated and refrigerant, which heat exchanger is 

produced from a material having high-long term stability 
to mechanical stresses. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that a plate heat exchanger is used for 

the indirect heat exchange (7') between the gas mixture 
(6) to be fractionated and refrigerant. 
Process according to Claim 8, characterized in 
that an aluminium plate heat exchanger is used for the 

indirect heat exchange (7') between the gas mixture (6) 
to be fractionated and refrigerant. 
Process according to one of Claims 2 to 9,  
 

characterized in that a heat exchanger is used for the 
indirect heat exchange (24) between the intermediate 

fraction (28) and the refrigerant, which heat exchanger 
is produced from a material having high-long term stability 

to mechanical stresses.
