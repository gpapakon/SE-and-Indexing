<ABSTRACT>
A traction device for transportation means is disclosed. The following modules are provided: a connection device (22) which can be connected to an electric power supply (23) and is connected to a power converter (21); a first drive unit in the form of an electric drive motor (20) which is connected to the power converter (21); a second drive unit in the form of an internal combustion engine (2); a generator (3) which is connected to the internal combustion engine (2) and to the electric drive motor (20) via the power converter (21); and various secondary units. The generator (3) is continuously mechanically connected to the respective secondary units (10, 11, 12) while the internal combustion engine (2) can be connected in a switchable fashion both to the secondary units and to the generator (3). In this arrangement, on the one hand, the generator (3) is disconnected from the internal combustion engine (2) and the generator (3) supplied by the power supply (23) is operated as an electric motor and drives the secondary units (10, 11, 12) when the electric drive motor (20) is operating by means of an external power supply (23). On the other hand, when the electric drive motor (20) is operating by means of the internal combustion engine (2), the internal combustion engine (2) is configured in such a way that it drives the generator (3) and the secondary units (10, 11, 12).
