<ABSTRACT>
Holes (7a) must be drilled into the bone material (4) in order to anchor implants, such as artificial acetabulae. The drilling axes (5b, 5c) must not deviate by more than an angle  alpha  from an axis (5a) extending normally to the anchorage body (3). An apparatus (12) for determining the course of drill holes (7a) in bone (4) comprises a hole gauge (1) with drill bush (1c) and handle (1a), as well as a sleeve (2) connected in articulated fashion to the drill bush (1c). The sleeve (2) has a support surface (2b) and, if appropriate, an extension (2h) which can be placed in a positively locking manner onto a passage hole (3a) in the anchorage body (3). While the sleeve (2) rests on the passage hole (3a) the drill bush (1c) can be moved in a fixed angular range  alpha . A limiting stop (2a) of the sleeve (2) and a limiting stop (1g) of the drill bush (1c) delimit the angular range  alpha .

A device for determining the path of drill holes
(7a) in bone (4), wherein the drill holes (7a) are

used to attach implants such as artificial
acetabula, consisting of a swivelling hole gauge (1)

having a guide channel (1f) for guiding a drill (7b)
and also a handle (1a) for the manual determination

of the direction (5a) of the guide channel (1f),
wherein the guide channel (1f) is formed by a drill

bush (1c) which in the region of its outlet aperture
(1h) is connected in articulated manner with a

socket (2), which socket (2) comprises a bearing
face (2b) in order to lay the socket on a member (3)

during drilling, and wherein both the socket (2) and
the drill bush (1c) have a limit stop (2a, 1g),

which limit the range of the swivel angle (Î±)
between the socket (2) and the drill bush (1c),
characterised in that
 the socket (2) has a concave
inner face (2g) and the drill bush (1c) has a convex

outer face in the region of its outlet aperture
(1h), which each have a spherical construction and

together form a spherical joint, which is designed
so that pressure exerted via the handle (1a) on the

member (3) can be transmitted via the spherical
joint to the socket (2) and enables the bearing face

(2b) of the socket (2) to be pressed onto the member
(3).
A device according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the inner face (2g) of the
socket (2) surrounds the outer face (1k) of the

drill bush (1c) in such a manner that the socket (2) 
and the drill bush (1c) are inseparably connected to

one another.
A device according to one of Claims 1 or 2,
characterised in that
 the bearing face (2b) of the
socket (2) is constructed in such a manner that it

can be laid with form fit on the bearing face (3b)
of a through-hole (3a) in the member (3).
A device according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that
 the bearing face (2b) has a
prolongation (2h) in the region of the outlet

aperture (2c) of the socket (2).
A device according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that
 the outer face of the
prolongation (2h) has a cylindrical or conical

design.
A device according to Claim one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that
 the limit stop (2a) of the
socket (2) and also the limit stop (1g) of the drill

bush (1c) are constructed rotationally symmetrically
with respect to the axis (5a) of the drill bush (1c)

when the drill bush (1c) is situated in the central
position between the limit stops (2a).
