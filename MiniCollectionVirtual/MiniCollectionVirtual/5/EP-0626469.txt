<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for pickling workpieces of highly alloyed materials, wherein the workpieces are dipped or passed into a bath. To provide a pickling process which is more advantageous with respect to its overall costs as compared with the known state of the art and can be safely handled in a simple manner without expensive controls, it is proposed that the bath contains less than 5% by weight of sulphuric acid, less than 4% by weight of hydrofluoric acid and less than 4% by weight of hydrogen peroxide as well as water as the starting composition. The bath temperature is held in a range between room temperature and 50@C. The replenishment with sulphuric acid and hydrofluoric acid, required according to consumption, is carried out in accordance with the determination of the actual concentration, and the replenishment with hydrogen peroxide is carried out in accordance with an indicator, hydrogen peroxide being held in an excess for operation in the transpassive range.
