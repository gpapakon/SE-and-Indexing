<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a combined method consisting of a prescription for the mode of operation of a temperature-controlled vessel for chemical reactions and of a mathematical method with which the heat transmission coefficient, which varies during a chemical reaction, of the reactor wall is determined based on the heat balance of the reactor internal space, but without a knowledge of the instantaneous reaction speed, from the temperatures, measured during the chemical reaction, of reaction medium and heat exchanger medium. According to the invention, a periodic heat flow is fed to the reactor, so that the temperatures of reaction medium and heat exchanger medium are excited into oscillations as a consequence of the heat transmission through the heat exchange surface of the reactor. The individual terms of the heat balance of the reactor internal space are integrated over one oscillation period, weighted periodically, and the heat transmission coefficient is expressed as the ratio of the integrated terms.

A method for determining the changeable heat
transmission coefficient of a container, in which a

periodic flow of heat is released and the resulting
changes in temperature are measured inside and outside

the container, furthermore the individual terms of the
heat balance of the interior of the container are

multiplied with periodic, preferably harmonic,
functions and preferably are integrated over an

oscillation period and that the heat transmission
coefficient is calculated therefrom,

characterised in that

the container is a chemical reactor, preferably a
stirred-tank reactor,
in order to dissipate the reaction heat, the
reactor has a reactor casing space in which a

heat-exchange medium is conveyed,
the reactor temperature T
R
 and the casing input and
casing output temperatures T
Ci
, T
Co
 are measured,
the periodic changes in the reactor and reactor
casing temperatures yielded by the periodically

supplied heating energy are detected and recorded,
the change over time of the heat transmission
coefficient during the reaction results in a

change of the phase relation over time, and
upon numerical evaluation of the temperature
oscillations the change in phase relation yielded

from the time constants of the heat transmission
of the reactor and of the sensors of the

temperature measurement means are jointly taken
into account when assigning the individual

measuring points.
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in
that the temperature of the reaction medium is

regulated.
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in
that the temperature of the heat-exchange medium is

regulated.
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in
that the periodic flow of heat is released as a

harmonic oscillation.
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in
that an electric heat source which is operated with

temperature-controlled liquid heat-exchange medium or
with superheated steam is used to produce the periodic

flow of heat.
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in
that the reactants are metered into the reactor at

periodically changeable temperature to produce the
periodic flow of heat.
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in
that a suitable term is included in the algorithm of

the regulation of the reactor temperature to produce
the periodic flow of heat.
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in
that the temperature-controlled reactor is given a

temperature regulation means with disturbance-variable
feed-forwards in such a form that the oscillations of

the reactor temperature are greatly damped or
eliminated.
