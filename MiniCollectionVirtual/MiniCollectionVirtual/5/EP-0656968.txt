<ABSTRACT>
A secondary belt for papermaking. The belt has a framework of protuberances (20) arranged in a semicontinuous pattern to provide a semicontinuous pattern of deflection conduits (40). The semicontinuous pattern is distingushed from the discrete and continuous patterns of the prior art. The protuberances may be generally parallel, or may provide individual cells within the deflection conduits between the protuberances. Also disclosed is the paper made on such a scondary belt.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus used for making cellulosic
fibrous structures, such as paper, according to the preamble of claim 1. Particularly this invention relates
to a belt used in a through-air drying process for making cellulosic
fibrous structures, and more particularly to a belt having a particular
pattern thereon which imparts properties to the paper in a like pattern.
The invention further relates to a cellulosic fibrous structure made on such an apparatus.Cellulosic fibrous structures, such as paper, are well known in the
art. For example, cellulosic fibrous structures are a staple of every
day life and are found in facial tissues, toilet tissue, and paper
toweling.One advancement in the art of cellulosic fibrous structures is
cellulosic fibrous structures having multiple regions. A cellulosic
fibrous structure is considered to have multiple regions when one region
of the cellulosic fibrous structure differs in either basis weight,
density, or both from another region of the cellulosic fibrous structure.Multiple regions within a cellulosic fibrous structure can provide
several advantages, such as economization of materials, increasing
certain desirable properties and decreasing certain undesirable
properties. However, the apparatus used to manufacture the multiple
region cellulosic fibrous structure will greatly influence these
properties.Specifically a secondary belt, or comparable other apparatus, can
affect the properties imparted to the cellulosic fibrous structure. As
used herein, a "secondary apparatus" or a "secondary belt" refers to an
apparatus or a belt, respectively, having an embryonic web contacting
surface and which is used to carry or otherwise process an embryonic web 
of cellulosic fibers after initial formation in the wet end of the
papermaking machinery. A secondary belt may include, without limitation,
a belt used for molding an embryonic web of the cellulosic fibrous
structure, a through-air drying belt, a belt used to transfer the
embryonic web to another component in the papermaking machinery, or a
backing wire used in the wet end of the papermaking machinery (such as a
twin-wire former) for purposes other than initial formation. An
apparatus or belt according to the present invention does not include
embossing rolls, which deform dry fibers after fiber-to-fiber bonding has
taken place. Of course, a cellulosic fibrous structure according to the
present invention may be later embossed, or may remain unembossed.An apparatus used in manufacturing a

<CLAIMS>
A macroscopically monoplanar apparatus used in manufacturing a cellulosic
fibrous structure and having two mutually orthogonal principal directions,

namely a machine direction (MD) and a cross machine direction, said
apparatus comprising a reinforcing structure (30) and a semi-continuous

patterned framework of protuberances (20) joined to said reinforcing structure
(30) and extending outwardly therefrom to define deflection conduits

(40) between said protuberances (20), 
characterized in that
 the semicontinuous
patterned framework of protuberances (20) forms a wave pattern of

protuberances (20) which by being unequidistantly spaced define individual
cells (42) within the deflection conduits (40), through which cells (42) a

cellulosic fibrous structure with regions of three mutually different densities
is manufacturable.
An apparatus according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 it is a secondary
belt (10) used in manufacturing a cellulosic fibrous structure.
An apparatus according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 said
framework of protuberances (20) comprises photosensitive resin.
An apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that

adjacent protuberances (20) of said wave pattern are offset from one another
with respect to the phase of the wave pattern.
An apparatus according to claim 2, 
characterized in that
 the protuberances
(20) span the entire cross machine direction of the belt (10). 
An apparatus according to claim 2, 
characterized in that
 said protuberances
(20) endlessly encircle said belt (10) in the machine direction (MD).
An apparatus according to claim 2, 
characterized in that
 said protuberances
(20) run diagonally relative to the machine (MD) and cross machine

direction of said belt (10).
A cellulosic fibrous structure manufactured by using an apparatus according
to one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that
 said cellulosic fibrous
structure has three types of regions of mutually different densities

comprising discrete low density regions bounded by semicontinuous high
density regions and discrete intermediate density regions.
