<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an
image sensor having a filter, and more particularly to an
image sensor having a filter for converting optical signal in the not
only visible but also non-visible region into
electrical signal.And the invention is suitably employed for an
image sensor having a filter for use in an image information
processing device such as a facsimile, an image scanner,
or a copying machine.In recent years, the uses of solid-state image
pickup devices have been diversified, with new
functions needed. For example, in addition to having
higher image quality and color picture of the copying
machine, they are required to recognize, reproduce and
record an invisible image. Such image, or invisible
image may be an image formed by the ink having the
characteristic of absorbing the ultra-violet or infrared
ray. The sensor technology for recognizing such image
uses both a sensor for sensing the visible light and a
sensor for sensing the invisible light.In a copying machine for forming the image by
sensing only the visible light, an infrared cut-off 
filter has been disposed on the optical path between a
solid-state image pickup device having color filters of
red (R), green (G), and blue (B) provided on an IC chip
of an image sensor such as a CCD and the original to
enhance color separation ability. Accordingly, when
reading and reproducing a printed image as the visible
image, using an infrared absorbent ink, for example, one
method can be conceived in which an optical system
dedicated for infrared rays without infrared cut-off
filter is prepared, apart from the optical path of
visible light, to image the infrared rays onto the
solid-state image pickup device for the detection of
infrared rays.However, since the above-mentioned method is
associated with a complex optical system, the present
inventors have sought a new method which adopts a
sensor in which a sensor for sensing the infrared rays
and a sensor for sensing the RGB rays are integrated
monolithically into one chip. However, this new method
can not provide a conventional infrared cut-off filter in
the optical path, because of its necessity of sensing the
infrared rays.Accordingly, a way of disposing an invisible
light cut-off filter represented by an infrared cut-off
filter must be improved, because one could not possibly
make effective use of the advantages of the above new
method. For example, in Japanese Laid-open Patent
Application No. 59-225564 or No. 62-174716, attempts
have been made to integrate together a sensor for
sensing
