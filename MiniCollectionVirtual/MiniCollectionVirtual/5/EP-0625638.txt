<ABSTRACT>
Power-generating system by quantum force comprises a 
plurality of structural members connected to one another at 

points A, B and C and adapted to be operated such that 
instantaneous transition from a balanced state where the 

reaction from earth is transferred through some members 
under the condition that external forces act on the points A 

and B to unbalanced system is caused by the release of the 
external force. This release causes the unbalance of 

vectors V2 at the point B and V4 at the point C. Some 
amount of external forces are applied to two of the members, 

No. 24 and No. 27 and the connection placed at the point B 
and pulled inwardly instead of the external force. 

Therefore the infinite repetition of instantaneous 
transition from balanced system to unbalanced system and the 

inverse transition is caused. Whereby torque which rotates 
some member in the structural system is produced 

simultaneously; during these repetition and generation of 
torque, extra energy utilized as moment of rotation is 

taken out mechanically.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a power-generating system by 
quantum force and, more particularly, to a power-generating 
system in which a link-motion mechanism is formed and 
infinite energy utilized as moment of rotation is taken out 
mechanically by using quantum force. If there is a system in which an input energy is not 
utilized directly for driving force and the reaction from 
earth generated by an input energy is able to be put into 
use in a moment, the additional acquisition of energy 
becomes possible. To accomplish this purpose, it is 
necessary to form a link-motion mechanism in the system. 
The word 'link-motion' means the action that the infinite 
repetition of instantaneous transition from balanced state 
to unbalanced state and the inverse transition occurs in a 
system. Thus once a link-motion mechanism is formed in a 
system, it may be possible to get infinite energy by 
introducing a constant energy. This invention is the power-generating system in which 
all of structural members are connected and/or equipped 
cleverly so as to operate as follows; instantaneous  
 
transition from balanced structural system -- where the 
reaction from earth is transferred through some members -- 
to unbalanced system is caused by some manipulation; and the 
infinite repetition of instantaneous transition from 
balanced system to unbalanced system and the inverse 
transition occur; during this repetition, extra energy 
utilized as moment of rotation is taken out mechanically. Fig. 1 is a sectional view of the embodiment of the

Power-generating system by quantum force in which all 
of structural members are connected and/or equipped cleverly 

so as to be operated as follows; instantaneous transition 
from balanced structural system - where the reaction from 

earth is transferred through some members under the 
condition that external forces act on points A and B - to 

unbalanced system is caused by the removal of the external 
force No. 100; at the same time, the connection shaft 

placed at the point B works instead of No. 100; the above 
removal causes the unbalance of vectors V2 at the point B 

and V4 at the point C; some amount of external forces are 
applied on the members No. 24 and No. 27; therefore the 

infinite repetition of instantaneous transition from 
balanced system to unbalanced system and the inverse 

transition is caused internally; torque which rotates 
some member in the externally stable structural system is 

newly produced; accordingly extra energy utilized as 
moment of rotation is taken out mechanically during these 

repetition and generation of torque.
