<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for defuzzing and depilling 
cellulosic fabrics. Without the application of finishing components, most cotton fabrics 
and cotton blend fabrics have a handle appearance that is rather hard and stiff. 
The fabric surface also is not smooth because small fuzzy microfibrils protrude 
from it. In addition, after a relatively short period of wear, pilling appears on the 
fabric surface thereby giving it an unappealing, worn look. A high degree of fabric softness and smoothness can be obtained 
by using fine (low-denier) yarns in weaving. However, the resulting cost is high 
as the loom output decreases concurrently with the (weft) yarn diameter. A less expensive way of ensuring a soft and smooth fabric "handle" 
is to impregnate the finished fabric with a softening agent, typically a cationic, 
sometimes silicone-based, surface active compound. This treatment also has 
some functional disadvantages. It does not remove pills and fuzz. The fabric 
obtains a somewhat greasy "handle" and its moisture absorbency is often 
considerably reduced, which is a great disadvantage, especially with towels and 
underwear. Moreover, the fabric is not wash-proof. Another method for obtaining a soft and smooth fabric is subjecting 
cellulosic fabrics to treatment by cellulytic enzymes during their manufacture. 
This treatment is known as Bio-Polishing. Bio-Polishing is a specific treatment of the yarn surface which 
improves fabric quality with respect to handle and appearance without loss of 
fabric wettability. The most important effects of Bio-Polishing can be 
characterized by less fuzz and pilling, increased gloss/luster, improved fabric 
handle, increased durable softness and improved water absorbency.  
 Bio-Polishing usually takes place in the wet processing of the 
manufacture of knitted and woven fabrics. Wet processing comprises such steps 
as e.g. desizing, scouring, bleaching, washing, dying/printing and finishing. 
During each of these steps, the fabric is more or less subjected to mechanical 
action. In general, after the textiles have been knitted or woven, the fabric 
proceeds to a desizing stage, followed by a scouring stage, etc. Desizing is the 
act of removing size from textiles. Prior to weaving on mechanical looms, warp 
yarns are often coated with size starch or starch derivatives in order to increase 
their tensile strength. After weaving, the size coating must be removed before 
further processing the fabric in order to ensure a homogeneous and wash-proof 
result.

<CLAIMS>
A process for achieving Bio-Polishing effects during the 
manufacture of a cellulosic fabric comprising the successive steps of: 


(a) cellulase treatment of the fabric, wherein a mechanical treatment 
inadequate to achieve Bio-Polishing effects is exerted; 
(b) inactivation of the cellulytic enzymes; and 
(c) mechanical treatment of the fabric to achieve Bio-Polishing 
effects during one or more of the remaining fabric manufacturing processes or as 

an additional step. 
The process according to claim 1, wherein cellulase treatment of 
the fabric and desizing are carried out simultaneously. 
The process according to claim 1, wherein cellulase treatment of 
the fabric and scouring are carried out simultaneously. 
The process according to claim 1, wherein the process is 
performed as a continuous process. 
The process according to claim 1, wherein cellulase treatment of 
fabric is accomplished in a J-Box, on a Pad-Roll or in a Pad-Bath. 
The process according to any of claims 1-5, wherein the cellulosic 
fabric is a towel.
