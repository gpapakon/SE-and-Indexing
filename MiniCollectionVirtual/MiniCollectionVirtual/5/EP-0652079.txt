Corner clamps for gluing or bonding at least two workpieces forming an angle, comprising two legs which are connected to one another at a fixed or adjustable angle, preferably consist of a rectangular metal section and each of which carries a clamping device by means of which the workpieces arranged between the legs can be pressed against one another and held in position. The clamping devices, in various embodiments, each comprise a part which can be fixed on the leg and a movable part which can be clamped against the workpieces by means of a threaded rod. In order to glue large workpieces, a plurality of corner clamps arranged with spacings on a suitable common support may be used.
