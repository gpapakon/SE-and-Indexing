<ABSTRACT>
The weft insertion needle (4) consists of a needle body (31) and a curved bracket (32) with two parallel legs (33) and a connecting section (35). The curved bracket is secured by the free ends of its legs to the needle body in such a way that there is a slot (34) between the needle body and the legs and a distance between the needle point and the connecting section (35) to accept weft threads (17, 18, 19). In a ribbon loom with such a weft insertion needle (4), the latter is arranged in such a way that the weft thread (18) to be inserted is held by the needle body and the slots (34) above and beneath the needle body (31) in relation to the plane of movement of the weft insertion needle (4) take the remaining weft threads (17, 19). Thus the weft threads which are not inserted do not float and are held after the insertion of the weft thread loop beside the warp threads (15, 16) to ensure proper securing thereof.

<CLAIMS>
Weft insertion needle (4, 5) for a ribbon weaving 
machine, having at least one slot (34, 55) formed over 

the active portion of the weft insertion needle and 
intended for receiving at least two weft yarns (16-19), 

and having a recess (30) open towards the free needle end 
and intended for gripping a weft yarn to be inserted, 

characterized by a needle body (31, 51), which has the 
recess (30), and a bow (32, 52) with legs (33, 53) 

running parallel and with a connecting portion (35, 54), 
the bow being connected by means of the end portions of 

its legs (33, 53) to the needle body (31, 51) in such a 
way that a slot (34, 55) is present in each case between 

each leg (33, 53) and the needle body (31, 51), in order 
to receive the weft yarns (17, 18, 19) not to be 

inserted, and a clearance which remains free is present 
between the needle point having the recess (30) and the 

connecting portion (35, 54). 
Ribbon weaving machine having a weft insertion 
needle according to Claim 1, which is arranged on one 

side of the warp yarns and which can be moved to and fro 
in order to insert a weft loop into a shed, characterized 

in that a slot (34, 55) is located in each case above and 
below the needle body (31, 51), the said slots extending 

at least over the entire fabric width, the opening plane 
of the slots lying transversely to the plane of movement 

of the weft insertion needle. 
Ribbon weaving machine according to Claim 2, 
having a weft-yarn and/or auxiliary-yarn tie-off device, 

characterized in that the connecting portion (35, 54) is  
 

intended for tensioning the weft yarns (17, 18, 19) 
located in the slots (34, 55) and the weft yarn last 

inserted, after the weft insertion needle (4, 5) has 
emerged from the shed, in order to facilitate retention 

and tie-off by the tie-off device.
