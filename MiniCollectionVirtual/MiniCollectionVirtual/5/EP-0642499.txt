 RETINOIDS AND THEIR USE IN TREATING SKIN DISEASES AND LEUKEMIATechnical Field The present invention relates to novel retinoids, methods for their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions comprising such compounds and the use of the compounds in treating the skin and in treating leukemia.Background Art Caucasians who have had a good deal of sun exposure in childhood will show the following gross cutaneous alterations in adult life: wrinkling, leatheriness, yellowing, looseness, roughness, dryness, mottling (hyperpigmentation) and various premalignant growths (often subclinical) . These changes are most prominent in light skinned persons who burn easily and tan poorly. The baleful effects of sunlight are cumulative, increasing with time. Although the anatomic degradation of the skin is most advanced in the elderly, the destructive effects of excessive sun exposure are already evident by the second decade. Serious microscopic alterations of the epidermis and dermis occur decades before these become clinically visible. Wrinkling, yellowing, leatheriness, and loss of elasticity are very late changes.It is known to use vitamin A acid for the treatment of acne as set forth in U.S. Patent No. 3,729,568. Other known uses of vitamin A acid which were reviewed by Thomas and Doyle in the Journal of American Academy of Dermatology. _, 505-513 (1981) , include, in addition to acne treatment, treatment of senile comedones, nervus comedonicus, linear verrucous nevus, plantar warts, pseudofolliculitis, keratoacanthoma, solar keratosis of extremities, callosities, keratosis palmaris et plantaris, Darier's disease, ichthyosis, psoriasis, acanthosis nigricians, lichen planus, molluscum contagiosum, reactive perforating collagenosis, melasma, corneal epithelial healing, geographic tongue, Fox-Fordyce disease, cutaneous metastatic melanoma and keloids or hypertrophic scars. Vitamin A acid derivatives (retinoids) are known to have prophylactic and 

 therapeutic effects on a great variety of tumors and are being increasingly used as anti-tumor drugs. The use of oral retinoic acid in treating leukemia has been reported by R. P. Warrell, Jr. et al. , New England Journal of Medicine, 324. 1385-1393 (1991) .Disclosure of the Invention The present invention relates to a compound of the formula:
