<ABSTRACT>
The connector assembly comprises a center connector (14) adapted to engage the end of the inner conductor (12) of the coaxial cable, a dielectric spacer (30) around the inner connector, an outer connector (20) in the form of a hollow cylinder with a thick central portion (21) for supporting a coupling nut (22), and thin end portions which form a pair of barrels (25, 26) projecting from opposite ends of the central portion. One of the barrels has a threaded inside surface (27) for threadingly engaging the corrugated outer surface of the outer conductor (11) of the cable. The inside wall of the outer connector forms a circumferential shoulder (28) which extends radially inwardly along the end of the corrugated outer conductor of the cable so that when the outer connector is threaded onto the outer conductor, the shoulder is pressed into engagement with the end of the outer conductor to make electrical contact therewith.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to connectors for coaxial cables, and,
more particularly, to an improved connector for coaxial cables having corrugated
outer conductors. The invention also relates to methods of attaching such connectors
and cables.Connectors for coaxial cable having corrugated outer conductors are generally
used throughout the semi-flexible coaxial cable industry. For example, Rauwolf U.S.
Patent No. 5,167,533 describes a connector for coaxial cables having hollow inner
conductors. Vaccaro et al. U.S. Patent No. 5,154,636 describes a connector for
coaxial cables having helically corrugated outer conductors. Doles U.S. Patent No.
5,137,470 describes a connector for coaxial cables having helically corrugated inner
conductors. Juds et al. U.S. Patent No. 4,046,451 describes a connector for coaxial
cables having annularly corrugated outer conductors and plain cylindrical inner
conductors. Van Dyke U.S. Patent No. 3,291,895 describes a connector for cables
having helically corrugated inner and outer conductors. A connector for a coaxial
cable having a helically corrugated outer conductor and a plain cylindrical inner
conductor is described in Johnson et al. U.S. Patent No. 3,199,061. DE-A-3708241 describes a connector for a coaxial cable having an inner conductor
and a corrugated outer conductor comprising an inner connector adapted to engage
the inner conductor of the coaxial cable, and an outer connector and a dielectric
spacer between the inner and outer connectors.A connector assembly having the features of the preamble of claim 1 is known from
DE-C-4202813.It is the primary object of the invention to provide an improved coaxial cable connector
which can be installed more easily and quickly than previous connectors. A related
object is to provide such an improved connector that is self-locating as it is applied to
the end of a coaxial cable, and which can be easily applied by hand in preparation for
a permanent attachment.A related object of the invention is to provide such an improved connector which
minimizes tolerance stack-ups.It is another object of the invention to provide such an improved connector which can
be efficiently and economically manufactured at a lower cost than previous
connectors.Still another object of this invention is to provide an improved method of permanently
attaching a connector to a coaxial cable, so good electrical contact is maintained
between the connector and the cable over a long operating life. A related object is to
provide an improved

<CLAIMS>
Connector assembly for a coaxial cable (10) having an inner conductor (12)
and a corrugated outer conductor (11), said connector assembly comprising:


an inner connector (14) adapted to engage the end of the inner conductor (12)
of the coaxial cable (10),
an outer connector (20) having a thick central portion (21) for supporting a
coupling nut (22), and a portion with a threaded inside surface (27) for

threadingly engaging the corrugated outer surface of the outer conductor (11)
of said cable (10), and
a dielectric spacer (30) between said inner and outer connectors (14,20),
characterized by
said outer connector (20) being unitary, and being in form of a hollow cylinder
having thin end portions forming a pair of barrels (25,26) projecting from

opposite ends of said central portion (21), one of said barrels (26) having said
portion with said threaded inside surface; and
the inside wall of said outer connector forming a circumferential shoulder (28)
which extends radially inwardly such that when said outer connector (20) is

threaded onto said outer conductor (11), said shoulder (28) is pressed into
engagement with the end of said outer conductor (11) to make electrical

contact therewith.
Connector assembly of claim 1, wherein said inside diameter of said shoulder
is approximately the same as a minor inside diameter of the corrugated outer

conductor.
Connector assembly of claim 1,
characterized in that
the portion (27) of said one barrel (26) having said threaded inside surface is
sufficiently thin to be crimped.
Connector assembly of claim 1,
characterized in that
the second barrel (25) of said outer connector extends coaxially along the free
end of said inner connector (14) to receive a mating (20) connector.
Connector assembly of claim 1,
characterized in that
the dielectric spacer (30) encircles the inner connector (14) so as to center it
respective to the outer connector (20).
Combination of a connector assembly according to claim 1 and a coaxial cable
(10) having a helically corrugated outer conductor,
characterized in that
said shoulder (28) has an inside diameter approximately as small as the inside
diameter of the helically corrugated outer conductor (11), of said coaxial cable

(10), for engaging the end of said outer conductor (11).
Method of attaching a connector assembly and a coaxial cable (10) having an
inner conductor (12) and a corrugated outer conductor (11), said method

comprising:

attaching the end of the inner conductor (12) of the coaxial cable (10) to a
center connector (16) of the connector assembly,
threading onto the corrugated outer conductor (11) of said cable (10), an outer
connector (20) having an at least partially threaded inside surface (27), the

inside wall of said outer connector (20) forming a circumferential shoulder (28)
which extends radially inwardly along the end of the corrugated outer conductor

(11) of the cable (10), so that said shoulder (28) is pressed into engagement
with the end of said outer conductor (11) to make electrical contact therewith,

and
crimping at least a portion of said threaded portion (27) of said outer connector
(20) into the corrugations of said outer conductor (11).
