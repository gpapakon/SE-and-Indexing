<ABSTRACT>
Method and system alters audio data for a synthesized 
voice so that when it is produced on a speaker system, it 

appears to emanate from a specific spatial position. First, 
the voice is synthesized into a speech waveform from a set of 

stored data representative of a text string using standard 
techniques. The speech waveform is converted into analog 

signals for a right and left channel. Then, the analog 
signals to the right and left channels are altered according 

to position data stored with the text string so that the 
synthesized voice appears to originate at the specified 

spatial position when the analog signals are sent to a speaker 
system.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to sound reproduction
and speech synthesis on a data processing system. More
particularly, it relates to a method and system for speech
synthesis in which spatial information is added to a
synthesized voice.While the visual images presented by the personal
computers compatible with those built by the IBM Corporation
have undergone a continual evolution of improvement, the
typical speaker system of such a computer remains a single,
inexpensive speaker buried somewhere in the system unit. The
sound emanating from the speaker is of poor quality being
unidirectional, fuzzy and difficult to discern. The personal
computer has been regarded as an important agent of change in
many areas of society, including education. Nonetheless,
repetitive tasks, such as language drills, which are not
regarded with universal enthusiasm on the part of students
even in the best of classroom situations, become even less
appealing in the acoustically impoverished environment
generated by a typical computer.Yet high quality sound reproduction for a personal
computer has only recently been regarded as particularly
important with the advent of multimedia. Although not yet
equal to even inexpensive stereo systems, some multimedia
computer systems use two external speakers for two channel
"stereo" sound. While stereo sound will help add excitement
and intelligibility to multimedia applications, further
improvements in sound quality from the personal computer and
its application programming are necessary to exploit the full
potential of multimedia.The stereo art teaches some lessons which have
application to generating high quality sound from a computer.
Indeed, many multimedia applications store conventionally
recorded audio such as a sound track on a tape or CD. This is
not surprising, as a considerable effort has already been 
devoted to stereo and there is little need to reinvent the wheel.
Researchers have been steadily refining stereo technology since the 1930s
when Alan Blumlein in US Pat. No. 2,093,540 taught the basic precepts
upon which much of the audio art is built. Despite the vast body of
improvements to the stereophonic art, it remains true that a conventional
recording does not faithfully reproduce the spatial sound field of the
original sound space and tends to produce a less satisfying listening
experience than a live performance.An appropriately programmed computer differs in many important
respects and possesses many additional capabilities than the most
elaborate stereo systems.

A method for providing an apparent spatial position to a voice
synthesized by a computer system, comprising the steps of:


storing a speech file (54) containing text data (155) and position
data (145) in a computer memory;
synthesizing a speech waveform from the text data contained in the
speech file;
converting the speech waveform into analog signals for a right and
left channel;
altering the analog signals according to the position data
contained in the speech file so that the synthesized voice appears to

originate at the spatial position specified by the position data when the
analog signals are sent to a speaker system; and
determining a user position with respect to the speaker system,
wherein the altering step is carried out according to the user position.
The method as recited in claim 1 wherein the speech file contains a

plurality of text strings (eg 100, 102, 104) each of which is associated
with a respective set of position data (145, 146, 148), and the

synthesizing, converting and altering steps are repeated for each of the
text strings so that each of a plurality of synthesized voices appears to

originate at a respective spatial position when the analog signals are
sent to the speaker system.
The method as recited in claim 1 wherein the speech file also
contains dialect data (151) and further comprises the step of first

altering the speech waveform synthesized from the text data according to
the dialect data prior to conversion to the analog signals so that the

synthesized voice appears to speak in a dialect specified by the dialect
data when the analog signals are sent to the speaker system.
The method as recited in claim 1 wherein the speech file contains a
plurality of text strings each of which is associated with a respective

comprises the step of first altering each speech waveform synthesized
from each text string according to the respective set of dialect data

prior to conversion to analog signals so that each of a plurality of
synthesized voices appears to originate at a respective spatial position

in a respective dialect when the analog signals are sent to the speaker 
system.
The method as recited in claim 1 wherein the determining step is

performed according to user input to a user interface presented by the

computer system.
