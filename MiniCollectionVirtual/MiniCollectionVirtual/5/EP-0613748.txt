<ABSTRACT>
A welder wherein metal fume is prevented from adhering to the vicinity of the surface of the weld, the flatness of the surface 
of the weld is improved and the deposition of the chrome carbide can be decreased. The welder is adapted for fusing respective 

predetermined portions (weld) of a plurality of members so as to connect the plurality of members to one another, and is 
characterized by having a means for applying magnetic fields having vertical components with respect to the surface of the weld.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a welder, and in 
particular, to a welder which is capable of preventing 
contamination by fumes such as metal atoms, and the burning 
of the surface of the welded portion, and moreover, has 
little welding heat input and is capable of welding with 
respect to welded members having various shapes. The 
welder in accordance with the present invention can be 
particularly advantageously applied to the production of 
semiconductor apparatuses of super high cleanliness. Tungsten-inert gas welding, arc gas welding, electron 
beam welding, and the like, can be employed in the joining 
of metal members. In this conventional welding technology, 
almost no consideration is given to the surface roughness 
of the welded portion, or to the deposition of metal fumes 
released from the fused portion. For this reason, problems 
were present in that burning, surface cracking, the 
deposition of chrome carbide and the like occurred, and in 
that impurities, primarily metal powder, were generated, 
and the long term reliability of the physical strength 
declined. In the conventional welding technology, the 
evaporation and dispersion of metal atoms and metal fumes  
 
comprising conglomerations thereof from the metal fused 
portion comprising the welding position occurred, these 
were cooled in the vicinity of the welded portion, and 
redeposited. It has been determined that these deposited 
metals separate in a corrosive gas flow, and as a result, 
it has been determined that this presents great problems in 
that it leads to a contamination or deterioration of the 
processing atmosphere, and this presents a particularly 
large problem in semiconductor production apparatuses 
requiring an atmosphere with an extremely high degree of 
cleanliness. Furthermore, because the welding heat input was high 
in the conventional welding technology, the welding bead 
was wide, and the surface thereof was rough. Furthermore, 
problems were caused in that there was considerable chrome 
carbide deposition, and particle boundary corrosion and the 
like was generated. The adhering of metal fumes, the surface cracking of 
the welded portion, and deposition of chrome carbide on the 
surface will be explained in greater detail using the 
figures. The structure of tungsten-inert gas welding of 
piping materials in accordance with the conventional method 
is shown in Fig. 16. In the figure, reference 1603 
indicates a tungsten electrode, while reference 1601 
indicates the piping materials which are to be
