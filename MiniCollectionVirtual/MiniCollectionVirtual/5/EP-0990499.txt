<ABSTRACT>
A compression mold apparatus (300) for compressing a segment (400) has a base (310) having an
elongated and substantially semi-circular mold cavity (312) and an end plate including a

blade (322) mounted thereon. The mold cavity (312) has a top opening. A ram (340) is aligned with
the top opening. The ram (340) includes two fixed opposing planar flank surfaces (342). The

two fixed opposing planar flank surfaces (342) are nominally centrally separated by a ram
groove (344) for mating with the blade (322) while allowing linear movement within the mold

cavity (312). A ram press (350) is connected to the ram (340) for translating the ram (340) linearly along
the blade (322) within the mold cavity (312). A plurality of cartridge heaters (382) is mounted in the

base (310) and arranged around the mold cavity (312) for heating the segment (400).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is generally related to a compression molds for compressing a composite having the shape of an arcuate segment of a cylinder with unidirectional carbon fiber in a thermoplastic or thermoset prepreg.Fiber reinforced thermoplastic or thermoset material, commonly referred to as thermoplastic or thermoset prepreg, or simply, prepreg, is used in the construction of structural parts for various devices. Prepreg has the advantages of being strong and rigid, yet lightweight, and thus, prepreg is used to make devices for aerospace, military, electrical and computer science applications.Prepreg materials generally consist of carbon or glass fibers impregnated within an epoxy or thermoplastic resin that is often formed into unidirectional rolled goods or other shaped ply. The fibers within the ply are oriented according to the device being constructed to provide the various structural parts of the device with the requisite strength and rigidity. Ply orientation is determined by the cut of the material. A ply is strongest in the direction of its fiber alignment. Thus, a portion of the fibers is aligned parallel to the direction in which strength is required by the structural part.Usually, several plies with different, but specifically designed, fiber orientations are assembled into a multi-ply assembly. Moreover, several multi-ply assemblies are then stacked on top of each other to compose a laminate, or layup, with a specific orientation of fibers to bolster the structural integrity of the part under construction. The layup is then cut into composite pieces and assembled into a prepreg wedge to form a particular structural part of the device under construction. Assembly of the prepreg wedge requires stacking and welding the composite pieces in sequence and orienting the pieces according to a geometry envelope. Typically, a plurality of prepreg wedges is compression molded to form one composite segment of the part under construction and several composite segments are assembled to form the entire part. One area where segment molding is used frequently is in the construction of segmented cylinders.For some useful applications, including composite sabots, compression molding of a segmented cylinder generally requires that sufficient prepreg wedges be loaded into a mold cavity to form a 120-degree composite segment of the cylinder, wherein three 120-degree composite segments form the entire cylinder. Subsequently, the mold cavity is heated and a press applies pressure to mold the prepreg wedges
