<ABSTRACT>
A casting mold for a low-pressure casting 
apparatus can be opened and closed and is closed to form 

therein a cavity (7) which is filled with molten metal to 
form a cast product. The casting mold includes an upper 

mold (3) of metal, a lower mold (2) of metal and a sand mold (4) 
which is disposed between the upper and lower molds and 

forms a part of the cavity (7). A top wall of the cavity is 
formed by a lower surface (3a) of the upper mold, at least a 

part of a side wall of the cavity is formed by the sand 
mold so that the upper mold contacts with the molten 

metal filled in the cavity (7) in a larger area than the 
lower mold.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of and an
apparatus for low-pressure casting, and more particularly
to those which facilitate automation of the casting step.Low-pressure casting has been wide used for mass
production of, for instance, cylinder heads of automotive
engines. In the low-pressure casting, molten light metal
such as aluminum alloy held in a tightly enclosed vessel
is cast in a cavity in a mold under a relatively low
pressure of inert gas or air applied to the surface of
the molten metal.Generally the mold employed in such low-pressure
casting is of metal and comprises a lower mold, an upper
mold which is moved up and down toward and away from the
lower mold and a pair of slide molds which are disposed
between the upper and lower molds to be movable left and
right and are slidably engaged with the upper and lower
molds. When these molds are closed, a cavity having a
shape conforming to the shape of a product to be cast is
formed.In such a casting mold, since the cavity is
entirely surrounded by metal walls, molten metal cast in
the mold is robbed of a large amount of heat upon contact
with the cavity wall and especially the molten metal cast 
in a part of the cavity which defines a thin part of the
product is very quickly cooled.As a result, molten metal cannot be fed deep into
the cavity or flow marks can be generated on the surface
of the product. Further the mold can expand due to heat
of the molten metal and the cavity can be partly
narrowed, which can result in short molding and/or
products with defects due to residual gas in the cavity.When a sand mold having a small specific heat is
used instead of the metal mold, temperature drop of the
molten metal and short molding can be minimized. However
since a pressure is applied to the molten metal during
casting and solidifying step, the sand mold can be broken
or moved. Accordingly, this approach cannot be applied
to casting of precision products.In order to overcome these problems, a novel
method of low-pressure casting and a novel structure of a
casting mold have been proposed, for instance, in
Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 63(1988)72466.In the method of low-pressure casting, the cavity
is formed by a sand mold, and the sand mold is supported
by metal molds. Then molten metal is cast in the cavity
and is held under a pressure.The structure of the casting mold comprises a
sand mold forming a cavity, metal molds supporting the
sand mold, and a gas discharge passage which communicates 
with the sand mold through the metal molds
