<ABSTRACT>
An item of data, such as data defining an image of a document (10), and identifying image 
data are stored in memory. The identifying image data define a human-produced identifying 

image (18) for the item of data. In response to query image data defining a human-produced 
query image (24) similar to the identifying image (18), the query image data and the 

identifying image data are used to access the item of data. The identifying image and query 
image can be produced making marks by hand, by controlling a machine to make marks, or by 

interactively using a machine to produce data defining an image. The identifying image (18) 
can be in a field (16) on a form requesting a store operation, and the form can be part of an 

image set that includes images of a document that the identifying image identifies. Similarly, 
the query image (24) can be in a field (22) on an access form (20) requesting an access 

operation. In response to the access form, a machine can automatically create a retrieval 
request form listing identifying images that are sufficiently similar to the query image to meet 

a criterion. In response to the marked retrieval request form, the machine can access and 
retrieve each requested document.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to data filing techniques.Using PaperWorks™ on a PC., Xerox Corporation, 1992, pp. 1-4 and 71-86, describes document
handling features of PaperWorks™ software, a product of Xerox Corporation Page 2 indicates
that the software stores a document as an electronic image and that a document from a
personal computer (PC) can be delivered to a fax machine, whether a document faxed to the PC
or a version of a document created on the PC. Page 73, near the bottom, shows an image of a
window entitled "Marketing Reports" within which an image of a name that had been writen
on a form is shown for a document sent to a PC from a fax machine. Page 79 indicates that such
a document can be renamed. Pages 82-83 show how a DOS document is included.Using PaperWorks™ from a Fax Machine., Xerox Corporation, 1992, also describes document
handling features of the PaperWorks™ software. Page 1 indicates that a user can retrieve
documents from a personal computer from a fax machine, whether a document faxed to the PC
or a version of a document created on the PC. Pages 9-11 illustrate forms used to retrieve
documents, and explain how to mark the forms to retrieve a document. Pages 20-23 illustrate
forms used to file a document on a PC from a fax machine, and page 21 shows a form in which a
user can write a name for a document.The PaperWorks™ software manages documents using a database. Each document is assigned
an identifier within the database, and this identifier can be used to access the document. In
addition, the document can have an identifying image in the database, stored so that the
document identifier can be used to access the identifying image and vice versa. In
automatically creating a retrieval form, the software can use the document identifier to access
the identifying image and can then include the identifying image in the form with a check box.
If an image of the form is subsequently received with the check box marked, the software can
use a description of the form to access the document identifier, and can then use the document
identifier to access the document and perform the requested retrieval operation.A system that performs data storing and retrieval operations must have a way of selecting a
stored item of data for access. Conventionally, an item of data can be stored in such a way that
it can be accessed based on an identifier that includes ASCII codes or other character codes.Conventional techniques for providing ASCII codes or other character codes to a filing system
can be
