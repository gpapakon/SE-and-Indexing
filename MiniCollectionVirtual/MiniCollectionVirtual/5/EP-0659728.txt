<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to 2-cyclopentenone 
derivatives and mixtures thereof, more specifically 
relates to novel 4-hydroxy-2-cyclopentenone derivatives 
and mixtures thereof having superior pharmacological 
activities such as an anticancer activity and bone 
formation activity and an anticancer agent and a bone 
formation accelerator containing the same as an active 
ingredient. Prostaglandins are compounds having specific 
biological activities, such as a platelet agglutination 
inhibitory activity, a vasodepressor activity, etc., and 
are useful naturally occurring substances which have been 
used in recent years in the field of medicine as 
therapeutic agents for diseases of peripheral 
cardiovascular system. Among the prostaglandins, 
prostaglandin A compounds are known as a prostaglandin 
having a double bond in the cyclopentane ring. For 
example, European Published Application No. 0106576 
(published April 25 , 1984) discloses a 4, 5-substituted 
2-cyclopentenone compounds including prostaglandin A 
compounds, which include a 5-alkylidene-4-substituted-2-cyclopentenone 
having the following formula: 
wherein W represents a C₁ to C₁₂ hydrocarbon group which 
may be substituted and Y represents a C₁ to C₁₂ 
hydrocarbon group which may be substituted and a 5-(1-hydroxy-hydrocarbon)-4-substituted-2-cyclopentenone 
having the following formula: 
wherein W' and Y' are the same as W and Y, respectively. 
Further, it is disclosed therein that these compounds are 
effective against malignant tumors. Further, European Published Application No. 0131441 
(published January 16, 1985) discloses 5-alkylidene-2-halo-4-substituted-2-cyclopentenone 
compounds having the 
following formula: 
wherein Ra represents a substituted or unsubstituted 
C₁ - C₁₂ hydrocarbon or a substituted or unsubstituted 
phenyl group; Rb represents a substituted or 
unsubstituted C₁ - C₁₂ hydrocarbon group; and X represents 
a halogen atom. It is further disclosed that these 
compounds are similarly effective for malignant tumors. Furthermore, it is also known in the art that 
prostaglandin D and J compounds, which are different from 
prostaglandin A compounds, are useful as antitumor agents 
(Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 58-216155  
 
and Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.), 81, 
1317 - 1321 (1984)). The present inventors clarified in European 
Published Application No. 338796 and International 
Disclosure No. WO91/05766 that there are an antitumor 
activity and bone-formation accelerating activity in
