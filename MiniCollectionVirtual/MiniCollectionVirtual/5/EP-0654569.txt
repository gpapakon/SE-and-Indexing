<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a corner edge profile for covering edges of stairs (steps), having a virtually vertically running section and a section which runs perpendicularly thereto and is designed partly as a strip for bearing on the border of the structure and partly as a covering flap for the material to be laid. In the case of said corner edge profile, the covering flap can be deformed plastically to adapt to the material height, and a predetermined breaking point is provided between the covering flap and the profile body.

Comer bead for covering a structure, in particular for the nosing of stairs,
comprising an approximately vertically extending portion and a portion extending

perpendicularly thereto which is designed partly as a bearing strip on the edge of
the structure and partly as a covering flank for floor material to be laid and is

plastically deformable so that it can be adapted to the height of the material,
characterised in that a nominal bending point (5) is provided between the covering

flank (1) and the bead body and that at least one recess (15) is formed on the
underside of the bead, said recess extending in the longitudinal direction of the

bead and receiving a free edge (29) of a seat angle (28) secured to the front of the
step (20) and that the inwardly directed underside of the portion (8) extending

perpendicularly to the bearing strip is stepped.
Comer bead according to claim 1, characterised in that the recess (15) is U-shaped
with straight walls.
Comer bead according to claim 2, characterised in that at least two steps (9, 10)
with partial surfaces extending perpendicularly to one another are provided.
Comer bead according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that a channel (16)
is provided in the bead above the bearing plane, said channel extending in the

longitudinal direction of the bead.
Comer bead according to claim 4, characterised in that the cross section of the
channel is adapted to the outer surfaces of the bead.
Comer bead according to one of claims 3 to 5, characterised in that the wall
thickness between the channel, on the one hand, and the recess and the joint

between the covering flank (1) and the bearing strip (2), on the other hand, is
approximately equal.
Comer bead according to one of claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the bearing
strip (2) can be secured to the edge by means of countersunk screws (6, 7)

optionally offset relative to one another. 
Comer bead according to one of claims 1 to 7, characterised in that the surface of
the bead is inclined in the transition region between the two portions.
Comer bead according to claim 8, characterised in that the angle with the verticals
is between 30° and 60°.
Comer bead according to one of claims 1 to 9, characterised in that the surface of
the bead is at least partially a non-skid surface.
Comer bead according to one of claims 1 to 10, characterised in that the bead
consists of aluminium.
