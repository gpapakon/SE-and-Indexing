<ABSTRACT>
A central inventory manager (12) accesses resource information 
in a central information repository (16) which in turn 

communicates with a database repository (20) storing past 
transactions. An inventory yield processor communicates with an 

inventory value enhancer (24), which is connected with the 
central information repository (16), and with a local 

information repository (28).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an information system for controlling inventory resources, for
example, architecture for maximising revenues derived from the sale of a given
inventory resource to a customer. In particular, the present invention according to claim 1 relates to a
system for accessing availability information on a computer system and continuously
computing a new minimum acceptable price for a given itinerary based on the current
market value of the itinerary, thus allowing the resource provider to maximise
incoming revenues from the sale of its inventory of reservations. Growth in the transportation business and, in particular, the airline industry has
resulted in the increased use of central reservation host computers for managing
flights, scheduling, and fare information on a real-time request basis. In past systems,
the host computer response to customer requests has employed a method and
architecture of accessing an available inventory of flights stored on a central
reservation database and categorising them by a numerical driven scheme. Examples
of such prior methods and architectures include systems such as American Airlines,
Inc., SABRE, EDS', System One, Covia, World Span, and other similar reservation
systems. While these prior systems have been effective in prioritizing available
inventory flight segments by such factors as class and seating availability the prior
systems fail to prioritize available inventory flight segments by the current market
value of the inventory flight segment.Operations Research, vol 37, no 2, March 1989, Baltimore, US, p 183-197
describes a model for controlling an airline seat inventory which takes account of the
uncertainty associated with estimates of future demand for seats as well as a structure
of booking limits in an airline reservation system.Nor can prior systems determine the correct market value by using the
customer itinerary as can the present invention.Additionally, present systems fail to adjust the value of an inventory element
by increasing fare prices when demand is high or decreasing prices when demand is
low.The current market value is determined by the present demand and supply as
well as the forecasted future demand and supply of the inventory element.
Consideration of the current market value allows the resource provider to maximise
revenues by determining the current demand, current average market value, and
current available supply for a given inventory element. The present invention provides an information system for controlling
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An information system for controlling inventory resources comprising:

a central inventory manager (12) for accessing and regulating via a first
communication means (14) inventory resource information which is stored in a

centrally located information repository (16);
a centrally located information repository (16) for storing said inventory
resource information, said repository (16) being communicably attached to the

inventory manager (12) via the first communication means (14);
a database (20) having means for storing, accumulating, and organising past
transactions related to the inventory resources and being communicably attached to the

centrally located information repository (16) via a second communications means (18);
an inventory value enhancer (24) communicably attached to the centrally
located information repository (16) via a third communications means (22) and having

means for acquiring inventory resource information from the centrally located
information repository (16) and information relating to past transactions related to the

inventory resources from the database (20) to calculate an optimal value of an
inventory resource taking into account the availability of the inventory resource;
a local information repository (28) for storing information relating to past
inventory resource allocation transactions and being communicably attached to the

inventory value enhancer (24) via a fourth communications means (26); and
an inventory tracker (32) communicably attached to the inventory value

enhancer (24) via a fifth communications means (30) and having means for accessing
the local information repository (28) via a sixth communications means (34) for

generating a report relating to transactions involving the allocation of inventory
resources.
A system according to Claim 1 wherein access to a plurality of centrally
located information repositories (16) via a plurality of communication means (22)

attached to the inventory value enhancer (24) is provided.
A system according to Claim 1 wherein the inventory value enhancer (24)
further comprises: 


means for acquiring type and value information related to the inventory
resources;
means for maintaining a database for storage of information related to past
transactions involving inventory resources; and
means for allocating the inventory resources.
A system according to Claim 1 wherein the inventory value enhancer (24)
further comprises:


an inquirer subsystem having means for acquiring inventory resource type
information from an information repository; means for acquiring inventory resources

value information from an information repository; means for accessing and acquiring
type and value information from a plurality of foreign information repositories; means

for executing an inventory resource allocation process; and means for rejecting
customers requests for specific inventory resources.
A system according to Claim 4 comprising:

means for acquiring type and value information communicably attached to the
means for allocating the inventory resources; and
means for maintaining a database communicably attached to the means for
allocating the inventory resources.
A system according to Claim 5 wherein the inventory tracker (32) further
comprises:


means for forecasting the future demand for inventory resources;
means for optimizing the allocation of inventory resources by using a scale
factor to allocate more inventory resources than are currently available; and
means for generating a report relating to transactions involving the allocation
of inventory resources.
