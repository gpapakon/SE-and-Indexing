<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for producing a containerised liquid is described. A container (90) is provided with a barrier (92) mounted therein. A gas (97) is introduced into the container (90) prior to the barrier (92) and after the barrier (92), a liquid (96) is introduced. The liquid (96) is pressurised with the gas to a higher than atmospheric pressure. The barrier (92) is permeable to the gas but is substantially impermeable to liquid. When the container is opened by rupturing using the rupturing mechanism (91), the pressure of the liquid (96) closes the atmospheric pressure and gas on the other side of the barrier from the liquid flows through the barrier into the liquid.

<DESCRIPTION>
 "A Pressurised Container for Providing an Effervescent Liquid"The invention relates to a pressurised container for providing an effervescent liquid in a container and especially, but not exclusively, for releasing a gas such as carbon dioxide or nitrogen into a consumable liquid, such as beer contained in a can.Traditionally, it has not been possible to reproduce the taste and quality of draught beer in beer contained in a can. One of the problems with achieving this has been the difficulty of releasing a gas, such as nitrogen into canned beer immediately before the beer is served.In accordance with a first aspect of the present invention, a method of producing a containerised liquid comprises providing a container having a rupturable wall portion, introducing a gas into the container, providing in the container a barrier which is gas- permeable and is substantially impermeable to liquid, introducing a liquid pressurised with gas in the container on the other side of the barrier, and sealing the container. 

 1 In accordance with a second aspect of the present2 invention, a pressurised container having a rupturable3 wall portion comprises a barrier which is gas-permeable4 and is substantially impermeable to a liquid in the5 container, the barrier dividing the container into6 first and second chambers, the barrier permitting7 passage of a gas in the container between the chambers8 so that when the wall portion is ruptured to permit one9 of the chambers to communicate with atmospheric10 pressure and creates a differential pressure between11 the chambers, gas in the other chamber flows through12 the barrier into the one chamber. 1314 Typically the barrier may comprise a material 5 impermeable to liquid and gas, and having a aperture 6 therein, and a gas permeable material covering the 7 aperture. Typically, the aperture has a diameter of 8 0.010 to 0.015 inches and preferably is approximately 9 0.012 inches. 0 1 Preferably the barrier is fixed in position before the 2 container is filled with liquid. However, 3 alternatively the barrier could be fixed in position 4 after the container is filled with liquid. 5 6 In accordance with a third aspect of the present 7 inventio , a method of producing a container liquid 8 comprises providing a container having a rupturable 9 wall portion, introducing a fluid into the container, 0 providing in the container a barrier which is 1 substantially impermeable to the fluid on one side of 2 the barrier, the barrier having means for selectively 3 allowing passage of the

CLAIMS
1. A method of producing a containerised liquid comprising providing a container having a rupturable wall portion, introducing a gas into the container, providing in the container a barrier which is gas- permeable and is substantially impermeable to liquid, introducing a liquid pressurised with gas in the container on the other side of the barrier, and sealing the container.
2. A method according to Claim 1, the method further comprising the steps of pressurising the liquid to force gas from the liquid through the barrier to the one side of the barrier.
3. A method according to Claim 2, wherein the step of pressurising the liquid comprises raising the temperature of the liquid in the can.
4. A method according to any of the preceding Claims, wherein the barrier is fixed within the container.
5. A pressurised container having a rupturable wall portion comprises a barrier which is gas-permeable and is substantially impermeable to a liquid in the container, the barrier dividing the container into first and second chambers, the barrier permitting passage of a gas in the container between the chambers so that when the wall portion is ruptured to permit one of the chambers to communicate with atmospheric pressure and creates a differential pressure between the chambers, gas in the other chamber flows through the barrier into the one chamber. 


 6. A pressurised container according to Claim 5, wherein the liquid is contained in the one chamber.
7. A pressurised container according to Claim 5 or Claim 6, wherein the barrier comprises a body member substantially impermeable to the gas and the liquid and having an aperture therein, and a gas-permeable membrane covering the aperture.
8. A pressurised container according to Claim 7, wherein the aperture has a diameter of approximately 0.010 to 0.015 inches.
9. A pressurised container according to Claim 8, wherein the aperture has a diameter of approximately 0.012 inches.
10. A pressurised container according to any of Claim 5 to 9, wherein the barrier comprises a material which swells when in contact with the liquid.
11. A pressurised container according to any of Claims 5 to 10, wherein the barrier comprises a movable portion which moves to fix the barrier within the container.
12. A method of producing a containerised liquid comprising providing a container having a rupturable wall portion, introducing a fluid into the container, providing in the container a barrier which is substantially impermeable to the fluid on one side of the barrier, the barrier having means for selectively allowing passage of the fluid through the barrier, providing a liquid in the container on the other side of the barrier, and sealing the container. 


 13. A pressurised container having a rupturable wall portion comprises a barrier substantially impermeable to a pressurising fluid and a liquid in the container, the barrier dividing the container into first and second chambers and including a pressure operable valve mechanism movable between a closed position and an open position, the valve mechanism allowing passage of the fluid and/or liquid between the chambers when the wall portion is ruptured to permit one of the chambers to communicate with atmospheric pressure to create a differential pressure between the chambers, the valve mechanism preventing such passage when the pressures are equal.
14. A method of producing a pressurised liquid comprises introducing a fluid into the container, providing in the container a barrier which is substantially impermeable to the fluid and the liquid, so that the liquid is maintained on one side of the barrier, the barrier having means for selectively allowing passage of the fluid through the barrier, introducing a liquid into the container on the other side of the barrier, pressurising

 the liquid to displace the barrier to pressurise the fluid, and sealing the container.
