Lathe adapted to turn workpieces (1), said 
lathe comprising a bed carrying: 


at least one headstock spindle rotated by drive means 
about a headstock spindle axis (I-I) and shaped to hold a 

workpiece (1) to be machined, 
at least one toolholder carriage (17) adapted to carry 
at least one turning tool (3) and to move in translation 

on the lathe bed along a radial infeed axis (III) 
perpendicular to the headstock spindle axis (I-I), 
means for causing relative movement in translation of 
the toolholder carriage (17) and the headstock spindle on 

the lathe bed along a carriage axis (IV),
 
characterised in that: 
at least one of the turning tools (3) has a continuous 
toothed cutting edge (4) and is mounted to rotate on the 

toolholder carriage (17) about a rotation axis (II) which 
is not parallel to the headstock spindle axis (I-I), 
said turning tool (3) is rotated by a gearwheel (5) 
mounted on the toolholder (17) and meshing with a lead 

screw (6), 
the lead screw (6) is mounted on a shaft (7) oriented 
in a direction (V) fixed relative to the lathe bed and 

parallel to the carriage axis (IV), the lead screw shaft 
(7) being fixed in the direction of axial translation 

relative to the lathe bed and being rotated by the means 
for rotating the headstock spindle of the lathe. 
Lathe according to claim 1 characterised in 
that the lead screw shaft (7) is rotated by the headstock 

spindle motor to which it is coupled by an appropriate 
mechanical transmission of the lathe. 
Lathe according to claim 2 characterised in 
that the lead screw shaft (7) is coupled mechanically to a 

power take-off (53) of the lathe by a universal joint 
transmission (54).  

 
Lathe according to claim 1 characterised in 
that the lead screw shaft (7) is driven by an 

auxiliary motor controlled by the numerical controller 
of the lathe. 
Lathe according to any one of claims 1 to 4 
wherein the lathe is a mutispindle lathe with a main 

drive shaft (50) driving all parts of the lathe and in 
particular a plurality of workpiece-holding headstock 

spindles (51, 52) each associated with a toolholder 
movable in translation on the lathe bed, one of the 

toolholders (17) associated with one of the headstock 
spindles (51) carrying a tool (3) rotatable about a 

tool rotation axis and rotated by a gearwheel meshing 
with a lead screw carried by a lead screw shaft (7) 

rotated by a power take-off (53) of the lathe to which 
it is coupled by a universal joint transmission (54). 
Method of turning a workpiece (1) using a 
lathe fitted with at least one workpiece-holding 

headstock spindle and turning tools mounted on at 
least one toolholder (17) characterised in that : 


a lathe according to any one of claims 1 to 5 is 
used, 
the method comprises a cutting step in which one of 
the turning tools (3) is progressively rotated about 

an axis (II) which is not parallel to the headstock 
spindle axis (I-I) to bring successive portions of the 

cutting edge (4) of said turning tool (3) into contact 
with the workpiece (1). 
Method according to claim 6 characterised in 
that said turning tool (3) is rotated at a speed such 

that there is substantially no apparent longitudinal 
slip between the active portion of the cutting edge 

(4) and the surface of the workpiece (1).
