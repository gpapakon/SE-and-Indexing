<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed to a method of improving 
the interface between a surface and a layer which is 

deposited on the surface. The surface can be the surface of 
a body (38) or the surface of a layer deposited on a body 

(38). The surface is subjected to the plasma of an inactive 
gas which does not adversely affect the surface or deposit 

a layer thereon. Then the surface is subjected to a plasma 
of a deposition gas which causes the deposition gas to 

decompose and deposit a layer on the surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a method of
improving the interface between layers formed by plasma
chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and, more particularly, to
a method of treating a device being coated to improve the
interface between the device and a layer deposited thereon
by plasma CVD.Plasma chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is a process
used for the deposition of layers of various material on a
body (substrate), particularly in the manufacture of
semiconductor devices and the like formed on an insulating
body, such as glass or a semiconductor body. In plasma CVD,
a body is placed in a deposition chamber which includes a
pair of spaced electrodes. The body is generally mounted on
a susceptor which can also serve as one of the electrodes.
A flow of a deposition gas is provided in the deposition
chamber. A radio frequency (rf) voltage is applied between
the electrodes which has a rf power sufficient to cause a
plasma to be formed in the deposition gas. The plasma
causes the deposition gas to decompose and deposit a layer
of the desired material on the body. Additional layers can
be deposited on the first layer by providing in the
deposition chamber a flow of a deposition gas containing the
materials of the additional layer to be deposited. Each 
deposition gas is subjected to a plasma which results in the
deposition of the layer of the desired material.One problem which has arisen in this process is a
tendency toward a poor interface between a deposited layer
and the body or between adjacent deposited layers. Such
poor interface can result in poor adhesion between the
deposited layer and either the body or the previous layer on
which the layer is deposited. Consequently, poor device
performance resulted. The poor interface is generally
discernable by the deposited layer having a hazy appearance
and/or having bubbles formed therein. It is believed that
the poor interface is the result of contaminants on the
surface being coated, such as particles or undesired gas
species, or different film properties at the interface as
compared to the bulk film properties. Therefore, it would
be desirable to be able to improve the interface between the
deposited layer and the body or layer on which it is
deposited to improve the adhesion therebetween.In GB-A-2 245 600 a process of metallizing a surface using a
plasma is disclosed. In particular, the surface to be
metallized is pretreated in the enclosure by a nitrogen post-discharge
microwave plasma without an addition of carbonyl
metal compound, in order to

A method of growing a structure by plasma vapor
deposition, comprising the steps of:


placing a substrate onto a processing position in a
plasma reaction chamber (12);
a first step of flowing a first gas into said chamber
(12) and exciting it into a plasma to deposit a layer of

silicon nitride onto said substrate placed at said processing
position;
a second step of flowing an inert gas into said chamber
(12) and exciting it into a plasma to treat a surface of said

layer of silicon nitride while said substrate is placed at
said processing position;
a third step of flowing a third gas into said chamber
and exciting it into a plasma to deposit a layer of

amorphous
silicon

onto said layer of silicon nitride while said substrate
placed at said processing position;
whereby the inert plasma treatment of the second step
improves the interface between the silicon nitride layer and

the silicon layer.
The method of claim 1, wherein

said first step includes applying a first level of RF
power to said chamber;
said second step includes applying a second level of RF
power to said chamber;
said third step includes applying a third level of RF
power to said chamber; and
said second level is less than said first and third
levels.
The method of claim 1 or 2,

wherein said inert, second gas consists essentially of a gas
selected from the group of hydrogen, nitrogen, argon and

ammonia.
The method of claim 3,

wherein said inert, second gas consists of
hydrogen.
The method of claim 1 to 4,

wherein said first gas comprises silane, ammonia and nitrogen
and said second gas comprises silane and hydrogen.
The method of claim 1 to 5, wherein said first, second,
and third steps continuously maintain a plasma in said

chamber (12).
The method of claim 1 to 6, further comprising a step
performed before said first step of flowing a inert, fourth

gas into said chamber (12) and exciting it into a plasma to
treat a surface of said substrate.
