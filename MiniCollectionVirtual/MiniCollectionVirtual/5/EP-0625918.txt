<ABSTRACT>
An inhalator has a vessel containing the substance to be inhaled and a lid that helps to vaporize and distribute the substance to be inhaled. The lid is provided with a substantially central opening (3) and with several holes (4) arranged substantially in a ring around the central opening (3). The cross-section of the central opening (3) is substantially equal to the sum of the cross-sections of the holes (4) arranged in a ring. The central opening (3) is more deeply recessed into the container (1) than the holes arranged in a ring, thus furthering the vaporization of the substance to be inhaled. The container (1) has an inner container (11) and a cavity (1c) located between the container (1) and the inner container (11). The cavity (1c) is filled with a heat-accumulating material (1b), in particular a tetradocanol (C14 H30 0).

Inhaler device with a vessel (1) containing the substance to be inhaled and with a lid
(2) helping to vaporize the substance to be inhaled ,which lid is provided with a

substantially central opening (3) and several openings (4) arranged substantially in a
ring around the central opening, whereby the central opening (3) is arranged deeper in

the vessel (1) than the openings arranged in a ring, whereby the cross-section of the
central opening (3) is substantially equal to the sum of the of the cross-sections of the

openings (4) arranged in a ring, and whereby the central opening (3) together with the
said several openings (4) positioned in a ring and the interior of the vessel (1) form an

air passage for breathing.
Inhaler device according to claim 1, characterized in that the lid is locked or lockable
on ist outside by a disc (5) sealing the vessel (1) contents evaporation-tight.
Inhaler device according to claim 2, characterized in that the disc (5) is rotatable
relative to the lid (2) and comprises holes (41) which form an air passage in the lid (2)

with the openings (4) in the lid (2).
Inhaler device according to claim 2 or 3, characterized in that a ring-shaped groove (8)
is provided for the mounting of the disc (5) in the lid (2).
Inhaler device according to any one of claims 1 - 4, characterized in that the opening
(3) is formed by a tube (31) which is shaped as an adapter for mouth and nose pieces

or for breathing masks .
Inhaler device according to claim 5, characterized in that there is provided in the tube
(31) a valve sealing the tube, which offers a slight resistance to the inhalationg of the

patient.
Inhaler device according to claim 1, characterized in that on the inside of the lid (2) or
vessel (1) there is provided a carrier (22) which is to be provided with the substance to

be inhaled, for increasing the surface of this substance.
Inhaler device according to claim 7, characterized in that on the inside of the lid there
is provided a holder (23) for the mounting of the carrier (22) which is to be provided

with the substance to be inhaled.
Inhaler device according to claims 5 and 8, characterized in that the tube (31) is
provided with the holder (23) ffor the mounting of the carrier (22).
Inhaler device according to any one of claims 7 - 9, characterized in that the carrier
(22) consists of paper, beard or crepe-board.
Inhaler device according to any one of claims 1 - 10, characterized in that the vessel
(1) contains an internal vessel (11) and between vessel (1) and internal vessel (11) a

cavity (10) is provided. 
Inhaler device according to claim 11, characterized in that the cavity (10) is
constructed thermally insulating.
Inhaler device according to claim 11 or 12, characterized in that the cavity (10) is filled
with a heat-storing material.
Inhaler device according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that between the openings
(3, 4) and the vessel (1) a membrane (26) sealing the openings is so arranged that the

flow path opens only on inhalation.
Inhaler device according to claim 14, characterized in that the membrane (26)
comprises a projection (27) projecting into the opening (3) with a slot (28) for forming a

lip membrane.
Inhaler device according to claim 15, characterized in that there is assigned to the
membrane (26) a supporting grating (32), which exerts on the membrane or parts of the

membrane a spring effect in the direction of the openings.
Inhaler device according to any one of the claims 1 - 16, characterized in that the
vessel (1) and/or the internal vessel (11) are constructed to be warmed, whereby for

vaporizing the substance to be inhaled there is provided an operating temperature lying
around or slightly above body temperature of about 50Â°.
