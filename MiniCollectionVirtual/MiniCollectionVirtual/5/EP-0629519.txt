<ABSTRACT>
A method of determining a pitch arrangement of a 
tire, to design and develop a tire efficiently. 
An initial value of the pitch arrangement is 
determined corresponding to a set value (100 - 104). A 

model of a noise pulse generated in each pitch of the 
tire, the objective function representing a physical 

amount for evaluating noise performance of the tire, a 
design variable for determining the pitch arrangement, 

and a constraint for constraining the pitch arrangement 
are determined for the initial value, and the pitch 

arrangement whose objective function converges and is 
minimized is determined while satisfying a constraint by 

varying a design variable (106). A pitch ratio whose 
value of the objective function is minimized is 

determined by fluctuating of the pitch ratio while the 
first and the last pitch ratio are fixed among 

determined pitch arrangements (108 - 110). The pitch 
arrangement and the pitch ratio whose value of the 

objective functions are minimized are selected among the 
pitch arrangements for a hundred initial values (112, 114).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
determining a pitch arrangement of a tire, and more
particularly to a method which makes it possible to
efficiently and easily determine the pitch arrangement
for attaining an improved noise performance of a tire,
as well as to determine the best pitch arrangement of
the tire at economic cost.Design work of a vehicle tire running safely and
quietly at a high speed on a dry, wet and an ice and
snow road has been well understood, and consideration of
a tire which runs quietly has been done theoretically.
Grooves arranged on a tread of the tire are designed
based on a repeated design cycle of a plurality of
variable pitches according to a formula calculated
mathematically.Land portions (called design elements hereinafter)
are divided by lateral grooves and circumferential grooves,
which form the pitch and the pitch arrangement on the
tire surface, and are arranged by a manual operation or a
tire mold based on a design value. The term pitch means a
relative length of the design element, and the pitch
arrangement means an order of the pitch arranged on the
tire surface. As described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open 4-232105,
though pitches can be different lengths, less than
approximately 9 kinds or less are used in practice. A
specific pitch length of a certain pitch arrangement can
be varied based on the circumferential length of the
tire. As a result, when a second tire runs at a lower
speed than a first tire, the specific pitch arrangement
of the pitch having a relative length of the first tire
whose diameter is greater than that of the second tire
generates the same acoustic fingerprint as that of the
second tire. (It can be simulated by a String Plot
which shows characteristics. The String Plot plots
amplitude〈ordinate〉 against harmonic
number〈abscissa〉 which shows the number of the times
of vibration during one round when the tire runs with
noise. )A method of design of the specific tread is
described by Landers in US-A-4327792 and US-A-4474223.
Another approach to optimize the design of the tread is
described by Flechtner in US-A-4598747. In this way,
slits are formed on each projection, and a wave length
and an amplitude of the slits to a dimension of the
slits are decreased as much as possible while satisfying
other standards. Further, Compos et al describe a
mathematical method of the design in US-A-4598748. In order to determine whether or not the above
mentioned approaches to the design of the quiet tire
succeed, a test must be done for the tire, and the
