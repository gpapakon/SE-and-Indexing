<ABSTRACT>
An automatic choking system designed to make a whole carburetor 
shorter and compact by comprising a case body (2) of nearly up-side-down 

L character shape; a thermo-element (3) housed in vertical portion  (2a) 
of the case body (2), a thermister (4) attached to a thermally expanding 

wax side at the lower end of the thermo-element heated up by electric 
current to increase its own electric resistance with the heat; a piston 

(3b) projected from the top end of the thermo-element (3) by the thermal 
expansion of the wax; a link (6) housed in the top portion (2b) of the 

case body (2) and supported therein so as to move downward the one end 
(6b) of the link (6) with the other end (6a) of the link (6) being 

pushed up with the piston (3b); a moving part downward by being pushed 
down with the other end of the link; a starter valve (10) provided at 

the lower end of the moving part (7) to close a by-pass connected with 
main air passageway with the moving part (7) downward; and a needle (12) 

to close an auxiliary fuel passageway.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a carburetor having an automatic choking system, 
said carburetor being provided for engines installed on 
motorcycles, motor scooters, etc. The automatic choking system for a carburetor installed on 
an engine is, as widely known, a system to increase fuel 
content at low temperatures of the engine in order to 
start the engine smoothly and to return the mixing ratio 
of the fuel with air automatically to a normal ratio 
for proper revolution of the engine with a 
rise in the temperature of the engine. Specifically, while a throttle valve of the carburetor 
is regulated by operating an accelerator lever, etc. to 
adjust the mixing ratio of a mixture of the fuel with 
the air in the main air passageway, a starter valve provided 
in a by-pass passageway by-passing the main air 
passageway and a needle provided in an auxiliary fuel 
passageway connected with the by-pass passageway are 
opened automatically at low temperatures of the engine to 
send a mixture richer than normal to the engine to 
start the engine smoothly. When the temperature of the engine goes up to reach the  
 
proper temperature, the starter valve closes the by-pass 
passageway automatically and the needle also closes the 
auxiliary fuel passageway automatically to return the 
mixing ratio of the fuel with the air to a normal ratio for 
proper revolution of the engine. US-A-4 815 427 on which the preamble of claim 1 is based 
discloses a fuel enrichment system for a multi-cylinder engine 
having a manifold balance line to deliver fuel to each of the 
cylinders as needed, including a valve located adjacent one of 
the carburetors to supply additional air/fuel mixture to 
approximately the center of the fuel balance line during the 
start-up of the engine. Figure 7 shows the outline of a conventional carburetor 
indicating main body 20 of the carburetor comprising main 
air passageway 21, by-pass passageway 22 by-passing the 
main air passageway 21, throttle valve 23 provided on the 
main air passageway 21, auxiliary fuel passageway 24 
connected with the by-pass passageway 22, starter valve 
25 and needle 26 forming the automatic choking system to 
open the by-pass passageway 22 and auxiliary fuel 
passageway 24 of the carburetor automatically while the 
engine is at low temperatures and to close these when the 
temperature was elevated. The Figure 7 omits to show the main fuel passageway 
provided on the main air passageway 21. The starter valve 25 and needle 26 are mounted on the 
tip end of moving part 28

<CLAIMS>
A carburetor (9) comprising: 

a by-pass passageway (8) bypassing a main air passageway; 
an auxiliary fuel passageway (11) connected with said by-pass 
passageway; and 
an automatic choking system (1) comprising: 
a case body (2); 
a thermo-element (3) housed in a portion of the case body 
(2); 
a thermistor (4) attached to a thermally expanding wax 
(3a); 
a piston (3b) projected from an end of the thermo-element 
(3) by thermal expansion of the wax (3a) ; 
a starter valve (10) 
to shut off a by-pass passageway 

(8); and 
a needle (12) to shut off the auxiliary fuel passageway, 
 
characterized by:
 
a lever (6) supported so as when one end (6a) is 

pushed up by the piston (3b), its other end (6b) is pushed down 
and pushes down a moving part (7) to operate the starter valve (10).  

 
The carburetor of claim 1 
wherein a thermally insulated cover (16) is provided on an 

outer surface of a portion (2a) of the case body (2) 
by a mono-block moulding with 

the case body (2) or separately.  
 
The carburetor of claim 
2 wherein the thermally insulated cover (16) is provided 

separately by means of a plurality of spaced circumferential 
walls of the cover (16), 

and a concave groove (16a) is formed on an inner surface 
of the cover (16) with a plurality of convex salients (2a') 

formed on a first part of an outer surface of the portion (2a) 
of the case body (2) and an annular salient (2a'') is also formed 

on a second part of the outer surface of the portion (2a) of the 
case body (2) and the thermally insulated cover (16) is put on 

from a first side of the portion (2a) of the 
case body (2) to mate the concave groove (16a) formed on the 

inner surface of the thermally insulated cover (16) 
with the annular salient (2a'') formed on the second part of the outer 

surface of the portion (2a) of the case body (2) so as 
to provide a space between 

the portion (2a) of the 
case body (2) and the thermally insulated cover (16). 
The carburetor of claim 
1, claim 2 and claim 3 wherein the relationship 

between an upward moving stroke of the piston (3b) of the 
thermo-element (3) and a downward moving stroke of the 

moving part (7) being pushed down by the other end of 
the lever (6) may be linear or variously curved by 

changing the shape of respective contact surfaces (5a,6a') of 
the piston (3b) projecting from the 

thermo-element (3) and one end (6a) of the lever (6), or of 
respective contact surfaces of the other end (6b) of the 

lever (6) and the moving part (7).  
 
The carburetor of claim 1, 
claim 2, claim 3 and claim 4 wherein the stroke ratio 

between the upward moving stroke of the piston (3b) of the 
thermo-element (3) and the downward moving stroke of the 

moving part (7) being pushed down with the other end (6b) of 
the lever (6) is variable by changing the supporting 

position of the rotatably supported lever (6).
