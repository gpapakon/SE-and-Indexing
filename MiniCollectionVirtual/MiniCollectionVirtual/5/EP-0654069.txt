<ABSTRACT>
Paint compositions containing (A) a vinyl type copolymer obtained by polymerizing (i) specific silicone type vinyl monomers 1-50 % by weight, (ii) vinyl monomers containing hydroxyl groups 5-60 % by weight, and (iii) other vinyl monomers 5-80 % by weight, (B) specific hydroxyl-group-containing silicone type compounds, and (C) a hardening agent that allows reaction with hydroxyl groups. Paint films can be formed which have excellent water-repellence and oil-repellence, and in which there is no lowering of water-repellence or oil-repellence when they are exposed for long periods in natural environments.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel paint compositions, 
and more specifically to paint compositions 
which allow paint films to be formed which have 
excellent water-repellence and oil repellence, and in 
which there is no decrease in water-repellence or oil-repellence 
even when exposed for a long period in a 
natural environment. Methods for conferring water-repellence and oil-repellence 
on paint by adding polysiloxane compounds 
have been generally known for a long time. This is 
because polysiloxane compounds have a low surface 
tension, and because they do not show phase solubility 
with usual paint resins the said polysiloxane compounds 
float to the top during the process of the drying of 
the paint film and form a layer of low surface energy. 
However, simple addition to paint resins of polysiloxane 
compounds alone, as is conventional, produces 
the problem that the low-surface-energy layer that 
forms on the paint film surface is prone to 
deciduation, and there is no escaping from a loss of 
water repellence and oil repellence with time. And the 
addition of large quantities of the said polysiloxane 
compounds to paint in order to suppress this decrease 
in water repellence and oil repellence with time also 
produces problems in that, because polysiloxane  
 
compounds have weak phase solubility with paint resins, 
it is difficult to obtain a uniform paint film. The purpose of the present invention is to offer paint 
compositions which allow paint films to be formed which 
have excellent water-repellence and oil-repellence, and 
in which there is no decrease in water-repellence or 
oil-repellence even when exposed for a long period in a 
natural environment. As the result of concerted research aimed at developing 
paints with the preferred qualities described above, 
the present inventors discovered that this purpose 
could be achieved with compositions containing vinyl 
type copolymers possessing a specific structure having 
a hydroxyl group and a polysiloxane moiety, and polysiloxane 
compounds possessing a specific structure 
having a hydroxyl group, and a hardening agent which 
allows reaction with hydroxyl groups; and we perfected 
the present invention on the basis of this information. 
Thus, the present invention offers paint compositions 
comprising (A) a vinyl type copolymer obtained by 
polymerizing (i) a silicone type vinyl monomer 
represented by the general formula 
 
(in the formula X is a hydrogen atom or a methyl group, 
R1 is a methyl group or a phenyl group, k is a
