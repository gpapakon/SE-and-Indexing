<ABSTRACT>
A file sheet storing device (1) comprising a first sheet (32a) 
made of a transparent material and adapted to cover one side 

surface of a file sheet (3), a second sheet (32b) made of a transparent 
or an opaque material and adapted to cover the other 

side surface of the file sheet. The first and the second 
sheets are connected together to form a bag-shaped cover (2;12;22;32) 

along three edge portions leaving the remaining edge portion 
at least partially unconnected to provide an opening for 

insertion of a file sheet. The bag-shaped cover is formed 
along one of the three edge portions with a bonded portion 

for binding the cover to a book-shaped binder (5;6;7). The cover is 
further formed along the edge portion where the bonded 

portion is provided with a line of attachment (8) between the 
first and the second sheets for preventing the file sheet 

from being displaced toward the edge portion where the 
bonded portion is formed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a file sheet storing 
device for storing a file sheet 
which is arranged for storing a plurality of information 
carrying mediums such as a picture slides in rows and/or 
columns in a plane. The present invention specifically 
relates to a file sheet storing device including a plurality 
of covers each comprising a first sheet and a second sheet 
which are made of a transparent material and connected 
together at least at three sides to form a storing bag 
having an opening at the remaining side for insertion of the 
file sheet, the storing bag being provided along one of the 
sides with binding means for making it possible to bind the 
bag with the file sheet stored therein in a binder. File sheets adapted to store information carrying 
mediums such as picture slides in rows and columns are 
widely used in view of conveniences that the information 
carrying mediums can be placed on a platen of an optical 
projector with the mediums held on the file sheet. The file 
sheet having a plurality of information carrying medium held 
thereon may be moved on the platen of the projector to place 
a desired one of the mediums at the projecting position. It is desired for this type of file sheets to provide a 
protective covers for covering the both side surfaces of the 
file sheets so that the information carrying mediums stored  
 
thereon can be protected from any possible scratches and/or 
deposition of dusts thereon. It is also desired that the 
covers are of transparent material so that the information 
carrying mediums such as picture slides can be visually 
observed through the covers. For the purpose, the Japanese utility model publication 
Hei 4-14225 which corresponds to US-A-4,997,089 
discloses a dust cover for a file sheet. The dust 
cover of this patent is made of a transparent material and 
comprises a first sheet adapted to cover one side surface of 
the file sheet and a second sheet to cover the other side 
surface of the file sheet. The first and the second sheet 
of the cover are attached together along three sides leaving 
an inlet opening formed along the remaining side. A cover 
flap is provided at the side where the inlet opening is 
formed. The cover is further formed along the side opposite 
to the side where the inlet opening is formed with a plurality 
of cuts at locations corresponding to the binder holes 
formed in the file sheet which is to be stored in the cover 
so that the file sheet in the cover can be bound in a binder 
of a conventional

<CLAIMS>
A file sheet storing device comprising a plurality 
of transparent bag-shaped covers (22, 32) each being arranged for 

storing a file sheet (3) for storing a plurality of planar 
information carrying mediums in rows and columns in a plane, 

each of the covers comprising a first sheet (32a) arranged for 
covering one side surface of the file sheet and a second 

sheet (32b) arranged for covering the other side surface of the 
file sheet, the first and the second sheets being connected 

together at three edge portions to form a configuration of a 
bag with opening means (22a, 33) formed along the remaining edge 

portion for inserting the file sheet, each of said covers 
being provided with binding means (7) to bind the cover along 

one of edge portions in a book-shaped binder; and 
prevention means (9) provided in each of said 

covers for preventing a file sheet stored in said cover from 
being displaced toward the edge portion of the cover where 

the binding means is formed, the prevention means being 
formed by a line of attachment between the first and the 

second sheets of the cover, said line extending substantially 
in parallel with and spaced by a predetermined distance 

from said binding means; characterised in that
 
said opening means (22a, 33) is formed substantially 

along the edge portion of the cover which is perpendicular 
to the edge portion where the binding means is provided;  

 
and in that said line of attachment (9) is located closer 

to the edge portion where the binding means (7) is provided at 
portions adjacent to said opening means to provide a wider 

opening for the insertion of the file sheet and extending 
gradually away from the binding means toward the direction 

of insertion of the file sheet through said opening means to 
narrow the space for inserting the file sheet into the 

cover. 
A file sheet storing device in accordance with 
claim 1, in which said first sheet (32a) of the cover is smaller in 

length than said second sheet (32b) so that said opening means (33) is 
offset by a predetermined distance from an edge portion of 

the second sheet of the cover. 
A file sheet storing device in accordance with claim 2, 
in which said second sheet (32b) is formed with flap means (11) 

along the edge portion of the second sheet adjacent to the 
opening means.  

 
A file sheet storing device in accordance with claim 
3, in which the flap means (11) is provided with means (11a) for 

biasing it in closing direction.  
 
A file sheet storing device in accordance with any one of the 
preceding claims, in which the cover is transparent at one of front and 

back sides, the other side being opaque.
