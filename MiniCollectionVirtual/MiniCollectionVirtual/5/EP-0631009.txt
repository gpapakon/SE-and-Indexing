<ABSTRACT>
Methods are described for the removal of core particles, 
fiber bundles and fines from a fibrous starting material 

obtained from hollow stalk plants such as kenaf, by field 
drying, chopping and coarse comminution of the plant stalks 

and subsequent summary removal of core particles. The 
material is pulped in hot water, and fine, lightweight 

fibers, other fines and residual core particles are 
separated from this first pulp. A fibrous pulp is 

recovered wherein the fibers include less than 10%, 
preferably less than 5 % by weight of non-fibrous 

materials. 
The separation of unwanted constituents may also be 
achieved by air classifying the plant material pretreated 

as above, in a special, vertical multistage wind sifter. 
The fibers which are obtained in a substantially 
uncontaminated state are useful as the sole fiber component 

or as reinforcing fibers in sheet materials such as mulch 
sheets, paper, cardboard, construction panels and packaging 

materials, etc.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for the recovery 
and processing of fibers from hollow stalk plants and to 
the use of the fibers obtained by the method. The invention 
particularly relates to fibers of dicotyledonous plants and 
more particularly to fibers of kenaf or hemp, their 
preparation, processing and use. The expression "hollow stalk plant" is intended to 
encompass all plants which form a hollow, generally rather 
long stem which is filled with a kind of woody marrow. 
Examples of such plants are the dicotyledonous plants such 
as kenaf and hemp, but also elder and some reed species. A dicotyledonous plant has two morphologically distinct 
regions in its stem, namely the outer bark fraction which 
contains the bast fibers, and the inner, woody core. The 
ratio between the stalk components varies according to the 
different species, the nature of the soil and others, and 
the outer portion comprises 40 to 10 % while the woody core 
comprises 60 to 90 % of the whole stalk. In this document, kenaf fibers will be taken as a basis for 
the following description of the invention. However, it is 
emphasized that the invention is not limited thereto but 
can be practiced in using all dicotyledonous plants which 
have an analogous structure. Kenaf (hibiscus cannabinus), an annual dicotyledonous 
plant, originates probably from Eastern Central Africa and 
is now cultivated all over the world. In Europe, it grows 
in a height of until 5 meters and produces a dry biomass  
 
substance of about 4 to 30 metric tons per hectare, 
depending on the growth conditions. During the last decade, plants have been searched for on a 
worldwide scale which grow rapidly and form cellulose since 
normal wood plants are growing too slowly for covering the 
rising demand for paper and paper-like materials. Due to 
this slow growth, cellulose prices are going up. 
Furthermore, especially conifers must be intensively 
chemically treated for providing paper pulp since they 
contain a considerable amount of resin and hemicelluloses 
which cannot be tolerated in paper. It has already become known to prepare paper pulp from 
kenaf. Thus, US-A-4,106,979 (Ruffini) discloses the 
preparation of paper pulp from kenaf and other 
dicotyledonous plants. It appears that for kenaf raw 
material to be acceptable as an economic papermaking fiber, 
it will be necessary to first separate the two said stem 
components which are greatly different in physical, 
chemical and morphologigal characteristics; only the 
fibrous components

A method for the recovery and processing of fibers from 
hollow stalk plants having bast fibers and core particles, 

comprising the steps of pulping a fiber material obtained 
by field drying, chopping and coarse comminution of the 

plant stalks and subsequent summary removal of core 
particles, in hot water to a solids concentration of from 4 

to 20 % by weight during about 5 to 50 minutes, of 
separating fine, lightweight fibers, other fines and 

residual core particles from this first pulp, and of 
recovering a fibrous pulp wherein the fibers contain less 

than 10 % by weight of non-fibrous materials. 
The method of claim 1 wherein said separation is 
carried out in a hydrocyclone having circumferential, 

central and intermediate collecting volumes, and recovering 
the fibrous pulp from said intermediate volume of the 

hydrocyclone situated between said circumferential and 
central collecting volumes. 
The method of claim 1 or 2 wherein residual fiber 
bundles and core particles are removed from the fibrous 

pulp obtained in the separation step. 
The method of claim 3 wherein the materials removed 
from said fibrous pulp, comprising fiber bundles and 

unopened core particles, are separated from the pulping 
water, milled for opening the bundles and the core 

particles, and the milled material is returned to the 
pulping step. 
The method of claim 2 wherein lightweight fibers and 
other fines are separated as a combined fraction, 

constituting the central collecting volume of said 
 

hydrocyclone, from said first pulp, and the lightweight 
fraction is combined with said fibrous pulp. 
The method of claim 2 wherein residual core particles, 
separating in said circumferential volume, are discharged 

as an aqueous suspension from said hydrocyclone, separated 
from the suspending water, and combined with the fiber 

bundles and unopened core particles removed from said 
fibrous pulp to be milled and returned to the pulping step. 
The method of any one of claims 1 to 3 wherein the

mm, and a second, long fiber fraction in which the fibers

comprising bleaching the fibrous pulp separated from fiber 

bundles and residual core particles. 
The method of claim 8 wherein the pulp is diluted to a

hydroxide is added to a concentration of about 1.5 % by 
weight, the mixture is heated for about 20 minutes to a 

temperature of from 80 to 90 Â°C, aqueous hydrogen peroxide
