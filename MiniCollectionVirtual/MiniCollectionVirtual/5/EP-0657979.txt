<ABSTRACT>
A device for producing a directed flow in air having at least one discharge electrode and at least two opposing electrodes which are arranged at the same distance from said discharge electrode and whose envelope lines located closest to the discharge electrode run parallel to said discharge electrode, and the opposing electrodes, seen in cross-section, have a curvature which is curved in the convex direction and faces the discharge electrode, and the distance between the discharge electrodes (1, 1') and the opposing electrodes (3, 3'; 3'', 6) is at least 50 mm. In order to achieve high efficiency, it is provided that the discharge electrodes (1, 1') and the opposing electrodes (3, 3'; 3'', 6) are arranged offset with respect to one another and that the discharge electrodes (1, 1') are arranged approximately on the cross-sectional centre plane (16') between two opposing electrodes (3, 3'; 3'', 6), the discharge electrodes (1) being at earth potential and the opposing electrodes (3, 3'; 3'', 6) being at a negative potential of at least 30 kV, and the convex curvature, facing the discharge electrodes (1), of the cross-section of the opposing electrodes (3, 3'; 3'', 6) having a radius of at least 2 mm.
