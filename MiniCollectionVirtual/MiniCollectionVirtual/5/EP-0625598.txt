Device for cleaning the Morel rollers of a 
card, the device being detachable and provided with a 

tool carrier (1) mounted on a carriage (3) movable on a 
tube (4) extending parallel to the axis of the Morel 

roller (2) and beneath the Morel roller (2) along its 
complete length, said device comprising at one end a 

cleaner (5) in the form of a semi-rigid self-cleaning 
lining, characterised in that it also comprises a 

counter-weight (6) at its other end and in that it is 
mounted pivotally on the carriage (3) by means of a 

pivot (7) fixed on said carriage (3) and so co-operates 
with said pivot (7) by means of a fixing lug (11) as to 

be detachable. 
A device according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that the carriage (3) is guided on the tube (4) by 

means of rollers (8) and is lockable on said tube (4) 
by means of a cam (9) actuated by means of a lever 

(10). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the upper surface of the cleaner (5) facing the 

Morel roller (2) so co-operates with the spiral winding 
of the clothing of said Morel roller (2) that the 

rotation of the latter results in an axial displacement 
of the tool carrier (1) and of the cleaner (5). 
Device according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that a number of tool holders (1) with cleaners (5) are 

operated beneath one and the same Morel roller (2).  
 
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that it is automated by provision on 

the carriage (3) of motorised means acting on the guide 
tube (4), means for pivoting the tool holder (1) also 

being provided on the carriage (3), such means acting 
on the tool holder in the direction of disengagement of 

the cleaner (5) from contact with the Morel roller (2). 
Device according to Claim 5, characterised in 
that the pivoting means for the tool holder (1) is 

advantageously in the form of a jack or an 
electromagnet.
