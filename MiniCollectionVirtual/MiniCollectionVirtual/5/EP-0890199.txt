<DESCRIPTION>
 The present invention relates to an electrical connector assembly comprising a seal disposed on an inner housing thereof. The seal includes slits formed therein for accommodating wires terminated to respective insulation-displacement type contacts of the connector assembly.Sealed electrical connectors are used in the automotive industry to protect electrical connections from moisture or other contaminants. Insulation- displacement type contacts are advantageously used in the automotive industry for inexpensive, reliable mass termination of wires in electrical connectors. Conventional automotive sealed electrical connectors are constrained to use wire crimp technology, and require the assembly step of inserting the crimped terminal or into the housing through the seal, thus risking damage to the seal. What is needed is a seal which can withstand the temperature and vibration inherent in an automotive environment, but is advantageously adapted for use with insulation-displacement type contacts without diminishing its sealing performance.A known sealed connector is disclosed in US-A- 4690478. This connector system requires two separate seals such that a first seal is placed around an inner housing, crimp terminals terminated to wires are assembled to the inner housing to form a subassembly, and then the entire subassembly is inserted into the other seal so that the seals are aligned with each other. This known connector requires many parts and assembly steps, and is not particularly suited for use with advantageous insulation-displacement type contacts. A known sealed connector is disclosed in US-A- 5100335. This crimp technology connector system requires a seal having slits formed therein, but the slits are not used to enhance assembly of the electrical contacts within the assembly. Rather, the slits are used to 

interlock the seal with projections on the connector housing wall.The present invention has solved the foregoing problem by providing an electrical connector which employs insulation-displacement type contacts but is fully sealed against moisture and other contaminants.An electrical connector assembly is provided which comprises a housing member with wire-receiving cavities for receiving respective electrical contacts therein, and a seal disposed on the connector housing having conductor-receiving apertures therethrough for receiving respective conductorÎµ adjacent to the recesses, the seal advantageously comprises at least one slit in communication with one of the apertures for receiving a

<CLAIMS>
a ms 1. An electrical connector assembly comprising a housing member (50) having wire-receiving cavities (56) for receiving respective electrical contacts (16) therein, and a seal (60) disposed on said housing member (50) having conductor-receiving apertures (63) there through for receiving respective electrical conductors (17) adjacent to said wire-receiving cavities, characterized in that, said seal (60) includes slits (67) extending from a periphery to respective conductor-receiving apertures (63) for receiving conductors (17) therethrough as the conductors are positioned within the conductor-receiving apertures. 2. An electrical connector assembly according to claim 1, wherein the seal (60) is mounted onto said housing member (50) by a retainer member (70).
3. An electrical connector assembly according to claim 2, wherein said retainer member (70) includes post-receiving holes (71) aligned with post-receiving apertures (61) in said seal (60) so that posts (51) on said housing member (50) extend therethrough to secure said retaining member (70) onto said housing member (50). 4. An electrical connector assembly as claimed in claim 2, wherein said retainer member (70) includes conductor-receiving slots (77) aligned with respective slits (67) in said seal (60).
5. An electrical connector assembly as claimed in claim 2, wherein said retainer member (70) includes recesses (74) into which protuberances (64) on said seal (60) are disposed for constricting the seal (60) around the conductors (17) within the conductor-receiving apertures (63) . 6. An electrical connector assembly as claimed in claim 2, wherein said retainer member (70) and said housing member (50) have latch members (72, 52) for 


latching said retainer member ( 70 ) and said housing member ( 50 ) together .
7. An electrical connector assembly as claimed in claim 1, wherein said conductor-receiving apertures (63) have undulated surfaces.
8. An electrical connector assembly as claimed in claim 7, wherein said conductor-receiving apertures (63) are staggered.
