<ABSTRACT>
The invention proposes a differential protection block (10) which can be fitted onto an electric circuit breaker (1) making it possible to avoid cabling mistakes. According to the invention, the differential protection block (10) includes two perpendicular branches (13, 17), a first branch (13) which encloses the totaliser transformer (11), and which encloses a passage (15) which must be followed for the cables for connecting to the terminals (7) of the circuit breaker, and a second branch (17) which encloses the triggering relay.

A differential protection unit (10) able to be fitted onto an electrical circuit breaker
(1), said electrical circuit breaker (1) being of appreciably parallelepipedic shape and

including:

a circuit breaker tripping mechanism,
a first side face (6) including a horizontal row of orifices (7) for connection to
terminals, and
a second side face (4), perpendicular to the first face (6);

said unit (10) including, in a case (12):

a summing transformer (11) comprising a magnetic toroid and a secondary
winding able to deliver a signal and
a trip relay controlled by said signal and serving the purpose of operating the
tripping mechanism of the circuit breaker (1);

characterized in that:

said case (12) of the differential protection unit comprises two perpendicular
branches (13, 17) both of which are of appreciably parallelepipedic shape ;
a first branch (13) which bears against said first face (6) of the circuit breaker case,
which contains the toroid of vertical axis and which presents at least one vertical

passage from end to end (15) so as to create an unavoidable path through said toroid
when connection of the cables (24) to the terminals is performed ; and
a second branch (17) which bears against the second face (4) of the circuit breaker
case and which contains the trip relay.
The differential protection unit according to claim 1, characterized in that the first
branch (13) and the second branch (17) are formed by separate cases (12B, 12A) so

that the separate case (12B) constituting the first branch can be fixed either on an
upper face (30) of the case (12A) constituting the second branch or on a lower face

(31) of the case (12A) constituting the second branch.
The differential protection unit according to either one of the foregoing claims,
characterized in that said vertical passage (15) is formed by several passages (15A

to 15D) arranged in correspondence with the orifices (7) of the circuit breaker (1). 
The differential protection unit according to any one of the foregoing claims,
characterized in that the first branch comprises in addition protruding connecting

strips, designed to engage via the orifices in the terminals, and designed to provide
the electrical power supply of the differential protection unit.
