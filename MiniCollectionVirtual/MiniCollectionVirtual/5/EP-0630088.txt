<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a pivoting chassis of a cabinet enclosing an electrical or electronic apparatus, comprising a rectangular frame in which the apparatus is mounted, and two cover plates. The frame comprises two horizontal crosspieces and two vertical uprights; the first vertical upright is fixed to the crosspieces at one of their free ends and the second vertical upright extends between the crosspieces and is spaced by a defined distance from their opposed free ends, defining an open surface between the said opposed free ends of the crosspieces and the second upright. The pivoting chassis furthermore comprises a first cover plate which is assembled with the second upright and a second cover plate capable of being assembled to the first cover plate or to the first upright.

A pivoting framework of a cabinet intended to receive switchgear equipment
notably electrical or electronic, of the type formed by a rectangular frame (7)

comprising two horizontal cross-members (9) and two vertical uprights (8) and at least
one cover plate (14), characterized in that the first vertical upright (8a) is fixed to the

cross-members at one of their free ends (9a) and the second vertical upright (8b)
extends between the cross-members and is separated by a set distance from their

opposite free (9b), defining an open surface between said opposite free ends of the
cross-members and said second upright, and that the framework comprises in

addition a first cover plate (14a), of reduced height, equal to that of the second
vertical upright (8b), and a second cover plate (14b) ; the first cover plate (14a) of

reduced height comprises first fixing means (37), cooperating with fixing means (82)
of the second vertical upright (8b) to be assembled with this second upright thus

occupying said open surface, and second means (27) of fixing to the second cover
plate (14b) ; the second cover plate (14b) comprises first fixing means (47)

cooperating with fixing means (84) of the first vertical upright (8a) and second fixing
means (57) cooperating with said second means (27) of the first cover plate (14a),

this second cover plate (14b) being able to be assembled to the first cover plate (14a)
or to the first vertical upright (8a).
The pivoting cabinet framework according to claim 1, characterized in that each
cover plate (14a, 14b), including its afore-mentioned means of fixing (27, 37 ; 47, 57),

is symmetrical with respect to a vertical mid-plane (60 ; 61).
The pivoting cabinet framework according to either one of the claims 1 to 2,
characterized in that the first upright (8a) has a height equal to that of the second

upright (8b) and extends between the cross-members (9).
The pivoting cabinet framework according to any one of the claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the second cover plate (14b) has a height equal to that of the

framework (7).
The pivoting cabinet framework according to any one of the claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that each cross-member (9) comprises in symmetry, at each of its

free ends, fixing means articulating on the cabinet. 
The pivoting cabinet framework according to any one of the claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the first and the second cover plate have an appreciably equal

width.
A cabinet comprising a pivoting cabinet framework defined according to any one of
the claims 1 to 6.
