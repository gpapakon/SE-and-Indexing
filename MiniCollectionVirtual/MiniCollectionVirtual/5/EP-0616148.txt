<ABSTRACT>
The invention proposes a stroke adjusting device for an eccentric drive which can be used, in particular, for an eccentric press. In order to obtain an eccentric drive with stroke adjustment without phase displacement of the resulting overall eccentric (e1 + e2) relative to a driving shaft (2) or a driving gear (7), two eccentric bushes (4, 5) of the same eccentricity are provided and are rotated relative to one another in such a way by way of a planetary gear mechanism (6) that the resulting overall eccentric does not turn relative to the driving shaft or driving gear.

Stroke adjusting device for an eccentric drive, in 
particular for an eccentric press, in which case by rotating at 

least one eccentric bush located on a shaft, with respect to a 
drive wheel or a drive shaft, a stroke adjustment of a connecting 

rod or the like takes place, characterised in that two eccentric 
bushes (4, 5) are arranged on a shaft (2), which is symmetrical 

with respect to its centre line (3), which bushes, for varying 
their identical eccentricities (
e
1
 = e
2
) may be rotated with 
respect to each other by way of gearing (6) or the like so that 

the resulting total eccentric (E) does not rotate with respect 
to the position of the drive shaft (2) or the drive wheel (7), 

the eccentric bushes (4, 5) being arranged detachably one against 
the other on the drive shaft (2) and for the stroke adjustment 

of the eccentric bushes, at least one eccentric bush (4) being 
held in a stationary manner and a further eccentric bush (5) 

being rotatably connected to the drive shaft (2). 
Stroke adjusting device according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the drive of a connecting rod (29) or the 

like takes place by means of the eccentric bushes (4, 5) during 
operation of the eccentric press (1) by way of a first gearing 

arrangement (7, 11, 13, 15, 16, 19) with displaceable gear wheels 
and toothed rings, t
he eccentric bushes (4, 5) being securely 
connected to each other (flux of force 28). 
Stroke adjusting device according to one of the preceding 
Claims, characterised in that a rotation of the drive shaft (2) 

by an angle β brings about a rotation of the co-rotary eccentric 
bush by 
α = 2β
, the vectorial arrangement of the interactive 
eccentrics e
1
, e
2
 leading to a total eccentric E, which always 
points in the direction of the angle of rotation β of the drive 

shaft (2). 
Stroke adjusting device according to one of the preceding 
Claims, characterised in that the adjustability of the eccentric  

 
bushes (4, 5) with respect to each other is achieved by way of 

a further gearing arrangement (7, 9, 23, 24, 20) (flux of force 
36). 
Stroke adjusting device according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the eccentric bushes (4', 5') are 

constructed as conical rings with external conical surfaces, 
which are located on an associated outer conical surface (49) of 

the drive shaft (2') and that clamping between the eccentric 
bushes (4', 5') with respect to each other and the clamping with 

respect to the drive shaft (2') is achieved by a hydraulic 
piston/cylinder unit (42).
