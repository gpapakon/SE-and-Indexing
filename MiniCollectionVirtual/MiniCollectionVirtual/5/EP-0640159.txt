<DESCRIPTION>
 PATENT APPLICATIONTITLE; A TISSUE MAKING APPARATUSBackground of the InventionField of the InventionThe present invention relates to a tissue making apparatus formaking tissue from stock. More particularly, the present invention relatesto a tissue making apparatus including a Yankee dryer.Information Disclosure StatementTypically, during the manufacture of tissue, a web is formed byejecting stock from a headbox onto a forming wire of a forming section.Subsequently the formed web is subjected to a pressing operation forremoving at least a portion of the water from the formed web.The partially dewatered web is then guided around the heatedsurface of a Yankee dryer. A Yankee dryer is essentially a rotatablecylinder having a diameter of approximately 25 foot. The cylinder is 

connected internally with a source of super-heated steam so that as the web is guided about the peripheral surface of the heated cylinder, the web is dried.Subsequently, the dried web is doctored from the surface of thecylinder and is then wound onto a reel. In order to assist in the drying ofthe web during passage thereof around the Yankee dryer, air caps encloseat least a portion of the peripheral surface of the cylinder. Hot air isdirected from such air caps onto the surface of the web in order to improvethe web drying process.By the provision of a through-drying means, which includes blowinghigh temperature air through the formed web, the present inventioneliminates the need for a costlypress section for initially dewatering theweb.Not only does the elimination of the press section greatly decrease the overall cost of the installation of a tissue making apparatus, but alsothe aforementioned through-drying, or air impingement arrangement,according to the present invention, greatly increases the speed at whichtissue can be manufactured. 

 Additionally, by the provision of the aforementioned air drying means, the diameter of the subsequent Yankee dryer can be much lessthan that of the typically installed Yankee dryer. Such reduction indiameter not only reduces the overall height of the resultant tissue makingapparatus, but also avoids the inherent problems encountered duringtransportation of the prior art large diameter Yankee dryers to aninstallation site.Therefore, it is a primary objective of the present invention toovercome the aforementioned inadequacies of the prior art tissue makingmachines and to provide a tissue making apparatus which makes asignificant and non-obvious contribution to the art of making tissue.An objective
