<ABSTRACT>
In a device for controlling the power consumption of a vacuum cleaner, it is proposed that the pulsating AC voltage which is present at the driving electric motor and fed by a phase-gating circuit is detected by a parallel voltage sensor, rectified, stabilised (smoothed), digitised and converted into a true r.m.s. value of the motor voltage on the basis of tabularly stored data from a memory assigned to a microprocessor, and subsequently compared with desired value voltages respectively corresponding to different power data, which are manually prescribed and assigned, and that the phase-gating circuit is driven in such a way that control is exercised at constant motor powers in accordance with the manual prescription independently of fluctuations or different supply system (network) AC voltage fluctuations or of the frequency.

A device for controlling the power consumption of a vacuum cleaner whose fan is driven
by an electric motor with a phase-angle circuit,


having a microprocessor as a control circuit,
having a voltage sensor (14) for the alternating voltage which is applied to the electric
motor (M) and is supplied by the phase- angle circuit (12) and
having a processing circuit which is connected downstream of the voltage sensor and
converts the sensed voltage value into a digitised voltage-actual-value,
the microprocessor converting this digitised voltage-actual-value into a root-mean-square
value of the motor voltage with the aid of a stored table and with regard to the set

operating angle and
having a voltage regulator which compares the root-mean-square value with a manually
pre-set voltage desired value and drives the phase-angle circuit (12) in an appropriate

manner.
A device in accordance with Claim 1,

having manually operable up/down push buttons for manually pre-setting the power,
having a booster stage for pre-setting a desired value, this booster stage effecting
maximum power output for a pre-determined period of time and
having an automatic stage which controls the suction pipe underpressure - lying
within pre-determined boundary values - upon cessation of the desired value

voltage/actual-value root-mean-square-value voltage comparison.
A device in accordance with Claim 2, having indicating means (LED1, LED2, LED3,
LED4, LED
A
, LED
B
) for the power stages controlled by the up/down push buttons, the
booster stage and the automatic stage.
A device in accordance with Claim 1, the voltage regulator being implemented in the
microprocessor. 
A device in accordance with Claim 1 or 2, having an optionally external store (17) for the
table, which store in addition stores and outputs booster-setting historical-data.
A device in accordance with Claim 1, the processing circuit comprising a rectifier, a
smoother for averaging and an analogue digital converter.
