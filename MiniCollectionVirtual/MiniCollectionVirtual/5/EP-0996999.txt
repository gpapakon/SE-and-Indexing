<ABSTRACT>
Bus driver having a P-channel output transistor (T1) for driving a first bus terminal (6) from a positive supply terminal (2), an N-channel output transistor (T2) for driving a second bus terminal (12) from a negative supply terminal (4), a P-channel driver transistor (T3) and an N-channel driver transistor (T4) series connected between the positive (2) and the negative (4) supply terminal. The control electrodes of the P-channel transistors (T1, T3) are interconnected and the control electrodes of the N-channel transistors (T2, T4) are interconnected to obtain a fixed relationship between the currents through the P-channel transistors (T1, T3) and through the N-channel transistors (T2, T4). The conduction of the driver transistors (T3, T4) is controlled by two floating control voltage sources (22, 24) which are connected between the interconnection node (20) of the driver transistors (T3, T4) and the respective control electrodes of the driver transistors. Any difference between the current through the P-channel driver transistor (T3) and the N-channel driver transistor (T4) is compensated for by a change in the voltage level at the interconnection node (20). In this way the currents through the driver transistors (T3, T4), and also through the output transistors (T1, T2) which are scaled copies of the driver transistors, are always equal and a highly symmetrical driving of the two bus wires (8, 14) is obtained. As a result, the electromagnetic radiation of the bus wires is low.

<DESCRIPTION>
 CAN bus driver with symmetrical differential output signals.The invention relates to a bus driver for transmitting data signals via wires of a bus, which bus driver comprises: a first supply terminal and a second supply terminal for the connection of a supply voltage for the bus driver, a first bus terminal and a second bus terminal for the connection of respective wires of the bus, a first transistor of a first conductivity type having a first main current path connected between the first supply terminal and the first bus terminal and having a first control electrode, a second transistor of a second conductivity type opposite to the first conductivity type having a second main current path connected between the second supply terminal and the second bus terminal and having a second control electrode, and drive means for driving the first control electrode and the second control electrode. Such a bus driver is known from European Patent Specification EP 0 576444 and is used in so-called Controller Area Network (CAN) bus systems which are used, inter alia, in cars. For this, use is made of transceivers (transmitter/receiver), information being transmitted as a differential signal via a two-wire bus having its two wires connected to the first and the second bus terminal. The transmitter supplies data signals to the bus and is from now on referred to as bus driver. The two bus wires are usually referred to as CANH andCANL and are connected to a pull-down resistor and a pull-up resistor at the receiver side. The voltages across the two bus wires have opposite polarities, as a result of which the spurious electromagnetic fields radiated by the two wires cancel one another. In the case of a high degree of symmetry the bus wires can take the form of a twisted pair and no expensive shielding is necessary. For this purpose the symmetry of the signals on the two bus wires should be as high as possible.It is an object of the invention to provide a bus driver having an optimum symmetry. To this end, the bus driver of the type defined in the opening paragraph is characterized in that the drive means comprise: 

 a common node, a third transistor of the first conductivity type having a third main current path connected between the first supply terminal and the common node and having a third control electrode coupled to the first control electrode, - a fourth transistor of the second conductivity type having a fourth main current path connected between the second supply terminal and the common node and having a fourth
