<ABSTRACT>
An optical branching device according to present 
invention comprises a cladding member, a first core member, 

a second core member, and a third core member. These core 
members are isolated each other, and the with of a edge face 

of the first core member is greater than total length of the 
widths of second and third core members' terminals facing 

to the first core member and a gap between the second and 
third core members. 
The waveguide type optical branching device comprises a substrate (1) 
made of a material comprising silicon, for example, and overlying 

transparent material layers (cladding member (2), and core members 
(10,20 and 21)) composed of, e.g. siO₂ (glass, silica glass). That 

is, these transparent material layers comprise the cores (10,20 and 21) 
with higher refractive indexes than the cladding (2). The transparent 

material layers comprise a non-branch waveguide (10), two separate 
branch waveguides (20,21), and a cladding (2) with a lower refractive 

index than the core (10) embedded therein. The waveguides (10,20 and 21) 
all are arranged in the direction of propagation of light. 
The non-branch waveguide (10) discussed here has a tapered waveguide 
(11) at the end of a straight waveguide (12). Both the branch waveguides 

(20,21) are bent waveguides of given widths and curvature radii, facing 
the edge face (11c) of the tapered waveguide (11) at a given space.

opposite to a first end face of the first waveguide at a
first given space. A third waveguide is also imbedded
in the cladding layer and is provided with a third end
face opposite to a first end face of the first waveguide
at a second space.Hereinafter, the first, second, and third waveguide will be referred to
as first, second, and third core member, respectively, and the first,
second and third end faces will be referred to as first,
second and third edge faces, respectively.The cladding member has a first surface. The first core
member comprises a first perpendicular section which is
defined by intersection with a first plane perpendicular to
the first surface; a second perpendicular section which is
defined by intersection with a second plane vertical to the
