<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for preparing light olefins by 
dehydrogenation of the corresponding paraffins, in particular C₂-C₅ 
paraffins (paraffins comprising between 2 and 5 carbon atoms). 
Olefins are important intermediates in the production of chemicals 
of widespread use, such as polypropylene, antiknock additives 
(MTBE), high-octane gasolines, alkylated derivatives and numerous 
other products. Notwithstanding the growth in the demand for these products, the 
expansion of industrial processes for their preparation is often 
limited by the poor availability of olefins, such as isobutene in 
MTBE production. This has lead to the identification of other sources of olefin 
supply in addition to the traditional sources (FCCs, crackers). 
Of these, one which is assuming an increasingly important role is 
the dehydrogenation of light paraffins. This, although 
stoichiometrically simple, presents both thermodynamic and kinetic 
problems. The reaction is endothermic and is controlled by the thermodynamic 
equilibrium. It requires for example a temperature exceeding  
 
500°C to dehydrogenate C₂-C₄ paraffins with economically 
acceptable conversions per pass. In addition heat must be 
supplied to the system to satisfy the endothermic requirements of 
the reaction. In spite of the high operating temperature the dehydrogenation 
rate is low, and it is consequently necessary to operate in the 
presence of a suitable catalyst. This must be thermally stable and able to ensure high selectivity 
towards the desired olefin, and in addition minimize isomerization 
side reactions, cracking, coking and aromatization, and provide 
industrially useful conversion yields. The inevitable formation of coke on the catalyst results in 
progressive reduction in catalytic activity, hence regeneration is 
periodically necessary. The formulation must consequently have high stability under both 
reaction and regeneration conditions. Numerous attempts have been made to identify catalytic 
compositions able to satisfy the requirements of this type of 
process. In this respect the patent literature describes numerous catalytic 
compositions both based on noble metals or combinations of these 
with other chemical species (US-3531543; US-4786625; US-4886928; 
EP-351067) and based on metal oxides in the presence of promoters, 
consisting in most cases of supported Cr₂O₃ (US-2945823; US-2956030; 
US-2991255; GB-2162082). However both these formulation families have drawbacks. Those 
based on noble metals require special
