<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides an ink jet printer and a 
water-soluble ink. Using the ink in the printer, the ink 

drying time after printing is extremely short. The ink is 
free from dot-dropouts and meandering of ink drops during 

printing with it. The base plates of the recording head are 
made of a plastic. The water-soluble ink contains a 

water-soluble dye having a chemical structure of formula 

(where R₁ to R₄ each represent OH group or NH₂ group),
 

a surfactant having a chemical structure of formula 

(where m and n each represent an integer of 1 or more), and a 
water-soluble organic solvent and water.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a recording head for a drop-on-demand type ink 
jet printer to be used primarily with electric calculators, 
cash registers, ATM's, facsimiles machines and similar devices. 
The invention further relates to an ink composition 
suitable for use in such a recording head. An ink jet printer of the above mentioned kind is desired to 
have the following characteristics: 
(1) The printer is free from dot-dropouts (missing dots on 
the print medium) and meandering of the flying ink drops 
expelled from the nozzle(s) of the print head. (2) After having reached the recording medium, the ink is 
immediately dried. (3) The electric power consumption of the printer as well as 
its size are small. (4) The commercial unit price of the printer is low. Several attempts have been made in the prior art in order to 
satisfy the above-mentioned requirements. For example, regarding characteristic (1), the technique of 
wetting the ink flow pathway from an ink reservoir to the 
nozzle surface of the ink-jet recording head was said to be 
an important factor, in order to attain uniform wetting of 
the nozzle surface of the recording head with an ink and preventing 
generation of bubbles in the ink. For instance, as 
disclosed in JP-A-1-123752, grooves are formed so that the 
distances between a center line of an array of nozzles and  
 
the respective edges are the same and the edges of the nozzles 
are made of Ni, Ti, SiO2, TiO2 or the like or are 
surface-treated by plating, vapor deposition, sputtering or 
the like coating means. As for (2), JP-A-1-111749 provides a heater-combined hot 
air-blowing unit so as to promote the drying of the printed 
ink by hot air. JP-A-1-252680 (corresponding to EP-A-0 320 223) discloses 
addition of more than 40 wt.% of a wetting agent and a nonionic 
acetylene diol surfactant or dioctyl sulfosuccinate surfactant 
to the ink for preventing the ink from becoming clogged 
and for smooth operation of printing on plain papers (but 
not on bad papers). Further, JP-B-58-6752 discloses addition of a tertiary alcohol-ethylene 
oxide adduct having the chemical formula [4] 
(for formula [4] and the other formulae mentioned hereinafter, 
see the list of formulae at the end of this description) 
to an ink so as to elevate the storage stability of the ink 
and to improve the smooth operation of printing with the ink 
on plain papers and the water-proofness of the printed images. However, the above-mentioned prior art has the following 
drawbacks: 
(1) The technique of
