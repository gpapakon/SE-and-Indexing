<ABSTRACT>
A technique for recording, reproducing, transmitting and/or receiving
compressed data utilizes frequency dividing filters (101, 102) for dividing the

frequency range of digital signals into plural frequency bands, orthogonal transform
circuits (103-105) for producing signal components in plural two-dimensional blocks

along time and frequency, an adaptive bit allocation and encoding circuit (108) for
quantizing and compressing the information for each two-dimensional block, and a

bit allocation and calculating circuit (107). When recording the information together
with information compressing parameters for each two-dimensional block, the

information compressing parameters for at least two two-dimensional blocks are
recorded collectively to avoid complexity in the structure of the sampling frequency

signal generating circuits or the like that would otherwise be caused in the case of
providing plural sampling frequencies, as well as to prevent an increase in hardware

scale.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods and apparatus for recording and/or
reproducing and/or transmitting and/or receiving data, for example bit-compressed
digital audio signals or the like, and recording media therefor. More particularly, but
not exclusively, the invention relates to an apparatus, technique and a recording
medium for recording with a compression mode of plural bit rates.Our United States Patents Nos. US-A-5 243 588 and US-A-5 244 705
disclose a technique consisting of bit-compressing input digital audio signals and
recording the bit-compressed signals in a burst fashion with a pre-set data volume as
a recording unit.This technique resides in employing a magneto-optical disc as a recording
medium and recording and/or reproducing AD (adaptive differential) PCM audio data
as prescribed in audio data formats such as CD- I (CD-Interactive) or CD-ROM XA.
The AD-PCM audio data is recorded in a burst fashion on the magneto-optical disc
with, for example, 32 sectors of the AD-PCM data and a few linking sectors for
interleaving, forming one recording unit.Several modes of the AD-PCM audio data may be selected in the recording
and/or reproducing apparatus employing the magneto-optical disc. For example, a
level A with a compression ratio twice that of the conventional compact disc (CD) and
a sampling frequency of 37.8 kHz, a level B with a compression ration four times that
of the conventional compact disc (CD) and a sampling frequency of 37.8 kHz and a
level C with a compression ratio eight times that of the conventional compact disc
(CD) and a sampling frequency of 18.9 kHz, are prescribed. That is, with the above-mentioned
level B, the digital audio data is compressed to approximately one fourth
of the original volume, with the replay time of the disc recorded with the level B
mode being four times that with the standard CD format. This indicates that the
apparatus may be reduced in size because a recording/reproducing time about as long
as that. 
achieved with a standard size disc of 12 cm in diameter may be achieved with a
smaller sized disc.However, since the rotational speed of the disc is the same as that of a
standard CD, the amount of the compressed data obtained with the level B per
a pre-set time is four times that of the standard CD. Consequently, the same
compressed data is repeatedly read four times, in a time unit of, for example, a
sector or a cluster, and only one of the four superimposed compressed data is
transmitted to audio reproduction. Specifically, during scanning or tracking
