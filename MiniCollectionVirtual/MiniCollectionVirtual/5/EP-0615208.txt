<ABSTRACT>
A self-organizing pattern learning system 
comprises an optical pattern correlation degree detecting 

means, which comprises a pattern storing means for 
storing a plurality of patterns, an input pattern 

displaying means for displaying a presented input 
pattern, and a photo detecting means. All or two of the 

input pattern displaying means, the pattern storing 
means, and the photo detecting means are located at 

positions adjacent to each other. The photo detecting 
means optically detects a degree of pattern correlation 

between the input pattern displayed on the input pattern 
displaying means and each of memory patterns stored in 

the pattern storing means. A learning pattern creating 
means creates a group of learning patterns in accordance 

with the degrees of pattern correlation, which have been 
detected by the optical pattern correlation degree 

detecting means, and the input pattern. A memory pattern 
updating means updates the memory patterns, which are 

stored in the pattern storing means, in accordance with 
the learning patterns, which have been created by the 

learning pattern creating means.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a self-organizing
pattern learning system according to the pre-characterizing part of claim 1.Matching techniques have heretofore been used
widely in the field of pattern recognition in image
processing. One of typical matching techniques is to
accumulate image pattern models, which have been selected
manually, as a knowledge and to carry out discrimination
of a target object by a matching operation. However, the
matching technique has various drawbacks in that, for
example, models of discrimination target objects are
fixed, and therefore the technique cannot cope with a
wide variety of changes in the target objects (such as
changes in sizes, directions, and shapes of the target
objects). Also, because ordering of image patterns is
not effected, if the number of models of image patterns
becomes large, it is difficult to ascertain whether or
not a pattern necessary for discrimination of a target
object is missing. Recently, in order to solve the problems
described above, a technique utilizing a neural network,
which simulates the principle of information processing
carried out by a brain of a human being, has been
proposed. The technique utilizing a neural network aims
at carrying out the learning of models of image patterns
by use of a learning model of the neural network and
utilizing the results of the learning operation during
the discrimination of a target object. Specifically,
with the technique utilizing a neural network, an attempt
is made to impart the flexible characteristics of the
neural network to templates at the learning stage such
that the templates can cope with a wide variety of
changes in target objects.By way of example, the learning models include
Kohonen's self-organized mapping, which is described in,
for example, "Self-Organization and Associative Memory"
by T. Kohonen, Springer-Verlag, 1984. The Kohonen's
self-organized mapping model learns topological mapping
through self-organization. The topological mapping means
that, for example, various signals which a human being
has received from the outer world, i.e., various signals
representing a certain group of patterns, are allocated
to neurons on the cortex in accordance with a certain
kind of rule reflecting the order of the patterns.With the system in which the pattern learning
technique utilizing Kohonen's self-organization is
employed, instead of various pieces of information 
representing the patterns presented from the outer world
being learned at random, such various pieces of
information are
