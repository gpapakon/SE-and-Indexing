<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel benzenesulfonamide 
derivative having endothelin antagonistic activity, and a process for preparing 
the same. Endothelin is a polypeptide consisting of 21 amino acids which is 
first isolated from the culture supernatant of porcine aortic endothelial cells. 
Now, it is known to be a potent vasoconstrictor, bronchoconstrictor and 
mitogen. It has also been reported that the level of endothelin is significantly 
increased in the blood of patients with essential hypertension, acute 
myocardial infarction, pulmonary hypertension, Raynaud disease, diabetes, 
atherosclerosis, and in the blood and the washing of airway of patients with 
asthma, compared with that of the normal human being. Thus, endothelin is an 
endogenous bioactive substance which stimulates durably and directly or 
indirectly the vascular or non-vascular smooth muscle. The excess production 
or excess secretion of endothelin seems to be one of the causes for 
hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, renal hypertension, Raynaud disease, 
bronchial asthma, gastric ulcer, inflammatory bowl disease (Crohn's disease), 
shock, carcinogenesis, restenosis after angioplasty, organ dysfunction after 
transplantation, diabetes, thrombosis, arteriosclerosis, heart failure, acute renal 
insufficiency, glomerulonephritis, cyclosporin-induced nephrotoxicity, 
myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, arrhythmia, glaucoma, migraine, 
cerebrovascular spasm and cerebral infarction. Thus, a compound which 
strongly antagonizes endothelin has been considered to be useful in the 
treatment of the above various diseases. On the other hand, Japanese Patent First Publication (Kokai) Nos. 
155864/1993 and 222003/1993 disclose as a benzenesulfonamide derivative 
having endothelin antagonistic activity N-{[5-substituted phenyl (or substituted 
phenoxy)]-6-hydroxyalkoxypyrimidin-4-yl}-substituted benzenesulfonamides, 
and the like.  
 An object of the present invention is to provide a novel 
benzenesulfonamide derivative having an excellent endothelin antagonistic 
activity. Another object of the present invention is to provide processes for 
preparing the same. The present invention relates to a benzenesulfonamide derivative 
of the formula [I]: 
wherein Ring A and Ring B are the same or different and each benzene ring having 
optionally 1 or 2 substituents selected from a halogen atom; C1-6 alkyl group; C1-6 
alkoxy group trifluoromethyl group; formyl group; a C2-7 alkoxycarbonyl group; a C1-6 
alkoxy group substituted by a
