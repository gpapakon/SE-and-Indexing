<ABSTRACT>
The crane tower is mounted with its base (2) on ball bearings (3). It has a structure (6) open at the top for insertion of a winding module (7), an installation module (8) and a driving cap (9) which projects forwards out of an opening (10) in the tower. The three modules are prefabricated and secured by bolts or screws to the structure and/or to one another. The top of the tower is closed with an attachment (11). Electric hydraulic equipment is housed in the installation module.

Method of producing and assembling crane
towers, particularly on-board crane towers (1),

characterised in that first of all a support structure
(6) for the crane tower (1) which is open at the top is

produced, ready treated with preservative and erected,
that prefabricated modules (7, 8, 9) including an

installation module (8) which contain individual
components (13 to 18) are inserted into the support

structure (6) and connected thereto and/or to one
another, and that the support structure (6) is then

closed from above.
Method as claimed in claim 1, characterised in
that modules (7, 8) are inserted from above into the

support structure (6).
Method as claimed in one of claims 1 or 2,
characterised in that at least one module (9) is pushed

laterally through an opening (10) in the tower and fixed
in the support structure (6).
Method as claimed in one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that individual or all modules (7, 8, 9)

are connected by force-locking and/or by form-locking to
the support structure (6) and/or to one another.
Method as claimed in one of claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that closing of the upper opening (5) of

the support structure (6) is carried out by placing a
hood-like top section (11) onto the support structure (6)

and connecting it thereto.
Method as claimed in claim 5, characterised in 
that the connecting is carried out by welding.
Crane tower, particularly an on-board crane
tower (1), with a support structure (6) in the inner

and/or outer regions of which individual components (13
to 18) are fixed and wherein some of the individual

components are assembled to form a replaceable winch
module (7) which can be introduced through an opening (5)

in the region of the support structure (8), characterised
in that others of the individual components (13 to 18)

are assembled to form further replaceable modules (8, 9)
which can be introduced into corresponding openings (5,

10) in the region of the support structure (6), one of
the further modules being an installation module (8).
Crane tower as claimed in claim 7,
characterised in that another of the further modules (8,

9) is a driver's cab (9) which is constructed as a module
and can be introduced through an opening (10) into the

region of the support structure (6).
Crane tower as claimed in one of claims 7 or 8,
characterised in that the installation module (8)

includes as individual components the main drive assembly
(14), feed pump assembly (15), hydraulic oil tank (16),

hydraulic valve elements (17, 18) and electrical switch
boxes (13) together with control means.
Crane tower as claimed in one of claims 7 to 9,
characterized in that the individual components (13 to

18) of the installation module (8) are electrically wired
and/or connected to one another by hydraulic lines.
Crane tower as claimed in one of claims 7 to
10, characterised in that the connecting lines for 

winches and slewing gears are provided in the region of
the modules (7, 8, 9).
Crane tower as claimed in one of claims 7 to
11, characterised in that the electrical and/or hydraulic

connections of the individual modules (7, 8, 9) to one
another are provided on the installation module (8).
Crane tower as claimed in one of claims 7 to
12, characterised in that the installation module (8)

itself can be made up of prefabricated steel sections
(12), in the region of which the individual components

(13 to 18) are fixed.
Crane tower as claimed in one of claims 7 to
13, characterised in that the support structure (6) is

closed on its upper face by a hood-like top section (11)
which for its part is provided with cable pulleys (
14).
