<ABSTRACT>
An angiographic catheter (1) exhibits elasticity as a whole and has at a distal end portion thereof a deformed portion (2) that is curved into a desired shape when no external force is applied thereto. The deformed portion (2) has at a distal end thereof a distal end opening. A plurality of minute side apertures (4) are formed in a portion that is located toward a proximal end of the catheter from the deformed portion. These side apertures (4) are arranged such that a reaction force generated by injection of a contrast medium (liquid) fed through a lumen of the catheter from the distal end opening is counterbalanced to the greatest possible extent by the contrast medium (liquid) injected from the respective side apertures.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an angiographic
catheter for using to radiography of a lumina of a human such
as a heart, a blood vessel of surrounding the heart, a liver,
a pancreas, a bile duct and the like.In general, a Judkins type catheter or an Anplatz type
catheter has been employed to form an image of a coronary
artery, whereas a pigtail type catheter has been employed to
form a X-ray image of a left ventricle.For example, the pigtail type catheter is introduced
into a blood vessel near the left ventricle from a femoral
artery using a Seldinger method or a sheath method. A guide
wire is inserted into the catheter so that the catheter is
able to proceed, retreat, rotate or perform other motions.
The catheter thereby selects a desired path from a plurality
of branching blood vessels and reaches an ascending artery.
Thereafter, a distal end portion of the catheter that is
curved like a loop is inserted into the left ventricle. In
this state, a contrast medium is fed from a proximal end
portion of the catheter and injected into the left ventricle 
in order to form an image thereof.Fig. 4 is a perspective view illustrating the
construction of the generally employed pigtail type catheter,
and Fig. 5 is a perspective view illustrating a state where
the contrast medium is injected from the catheter as
illustrated in Fig. 4.As illustrated in these figures, the generally employed
pigtail type catheter 11 has a distal end opening 13 and a
plurality of side apertures 14. The side apertures 14 are
located toward the proximal end portion of the catheter 11
from a loop-like deformed portion 12. Hence, a contrast
medium 8 is injected from the distal end opening 13 and the
respective side apertures 14.In this case, the respective side apertures 14 are
formed perpendicularly to an outer peripheral wall of the
catheter 11. However, the contrast medium 8, which is fed
under a high pressure, is not injected perpendicularly to the
outer peripheral wall of the catheter 11 but obliquely toward
the distal end of the catheter 11 (See arrows as illustrated
in Fig. 5). This is because the side apertures 14 have a
relatively large diameter (0.9mm).Hence, a reaction force generated by injection of the
contrast medium 8 moves (or displaces) the distal end portion
of the catheter 11 toward the proximal end portion of the
catheter 11, that is, toward a sinus of Valsalva. Also, the
reaction force generated by injection of the contrast medium 
8 from the distal end opening 13 of the catheter 11 moves the
distal end portion of
