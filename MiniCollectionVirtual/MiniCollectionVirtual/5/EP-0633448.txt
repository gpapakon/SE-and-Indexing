<ABSTRACT>
Anaerobic sealing is used on the interfaces between ammunition parts, 
e.g. of initiators, squibs, detonators, actuators, primers or other 

pyrotechnic devices and explosive devices. Said interfaces can comprise 
metal to metal, metal to non-metal or non-metal to non-metal interfaces 

between for example sleeve and plug, chamber and housing, insulator and 
sleeve or electrical structures and insulators. Said anaerobic sealing 

can comprise acrylate sealant.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a means of sealing the 
interfaces in energetic devices with anaerobic sealants. Anaerobic 
seals for interfaces between like-to-like materials or dissimilar-to-dissimilar 
materials in assembled devices such as squibs, 
detonators, mechanical actuators, initiators, and primers are found 
easier to produce commercially and equivalent in service to present 
seals. The present technology is aware that interfacial seals between 
like materials and interfacial seals between dissimilar materials 
remains a problem in the energetic devices art. Welding and 
soldering techniques are considered the benchmark technology which 
is known to this art and provide substantial means for sealing the 
troubled interfaces that concern the present invention. These 
techniques, however, do not easily lend themselves to the rigors of 
commercial production. Chemical sealant techniques have been used 
to seal interfaces, for example in U.S. patent 3,971,320, 
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, potting materials 
such as epoxy resins are disclosed to seal the interfaces of squibs 
to insure environmentally tight seals. Energetic devices comprise a generic group of assembled 
structures that require a chamber which provides a common reaction 
forum thus enabling explosive compositions to react. For reliable 
reactions, the chamber and its companion structural interfaces must 
be sealed against the ingress of moisture and other contaminants 
often found in the hostile environments in which these devices must 
function. Anaerobic sealing techniques are generally known to 
those skilled in the explosive ordnance art such as that used with 
percussion primers.  The present invention is directed to the use of anaerobic 
sealing techniques for interfaces in energetic devices. Such use 
is heretofore unknown for these devices and give significant 
manufacturing advantages, such as ease of sealing these surfaces in 
a fast and economic manner, thus reducing production costs. 
Additionally, means may be added to the anaerobic sealing technique 
to facilitate quality assurance, an important aspect of any 
energetic device manufacturing process. As those skilled in this 
art appreciate, once manufactured it is difficult to determine 
sealant presence at the interfaces, the present invention lends 
itself to such a determination. The present invention is useful for all manner of sealing 
interfaces in energetic devices, this is especially useful in 
the automotive airbag business in the
