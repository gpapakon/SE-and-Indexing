<ABSTRACT>
An arrangement has several analog input units (AE1, AE2) to which sensors (TE1, TE2, KD) arranged at measurement sites and at a comparison site are connectable. The analog input units derive measurement values from the signals of the measurement site sensors and from the signal of the comparison site sensor (KD). The units can be switched between a first and a second mode of operation, in the first mode of operation, one of the units detects the signal from the comparison site sensor and in the second mode of operation the other units receive said signal. The comparison values can thus be determined with less complexity. The invention is applicable in analog input units of store programmable controls.

<CLAIMS>
Arrangement having several analog input units 
(AE1, AE2) to which sensors (TE1, TE2, KD) applied to 

measuring points and to a reference point can be 
connected and which determine measured variables from 

the signals of the measuring point sensors and the 
signal of the reference point sensor, characterized in 

that 

the units (AE1, AE2) are each connectable into a 
first and into a second operating mode, 
one of the units (AE1) in the first operating mode 
detects the signal of the reference point sensor 

(KD) and relays it to the other units (AE2) and 
the other units (AE2) in the second operating mode 
receive the signal of the reference point sensor 

(KD). 
Arrangement according to claim 1,
 
characterized in that the measuring point sensors are 

thermal elements and the reference point sensor is a 
resistance thermometer. 
Arrangement according to claim 1 or 2,
 
characterized in that a central processor (ZP) adjusts 

the operating modes of the analog input units (AE1, 
AE2).
