<DESCRIPTION>
 HIGH DENSITY SERVERLETS UTILIZING HIGH SPEED DATA BUSFIELDThe present invention is directed to a system module for coupling a network to I/O resources. More particularly, the present invention is directed to a system module having a plurality of serverlets that share I/O resources such as disk systems.BACKGROUNDAs technology has progressed, the processing capabilities of computer systems has increased dramatically. This increase has led to a dramatic increase in the types of software applications that can be executed on a computer system as well as an increase in the functionality of these software applications. The increase in processing capabilities also allows modern computer systems to execute multiple software applications concurrently, such as by including multiple microprocessors in a computer system or by sharing microprocessor time. Additionally, technological advancements have led the way for multiple computer systems, each executing multiple software applications, to be easily connected together via a network. Conventional servers typically are self-contained units that include their own functionality such as disk drive systems, cooling systems, input/output (I/O) subsystems and power subsystems. If multiple servers are desired or needed then each server may be housed within its own independent cabinet (or housing). However, it is desirable to reduce the size of servers so as to provide the functionality of servers in smaller sized 

cabinets. At the same time, it is desirable to have a plurality of processors each capable of separately running simultaneously.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The foregoing and a better understanding of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of example embodiments and the claims when read in connection with the accompanying drawings, all forming a part of the disclosure of this invention. While the foregoing and following written and illustrated disclosure focuses on disclosing example embodiments of the invention, it should be clearly understood that the same is by way of illustration and example only and the invention is not limited thereto.The following represents brief descriptions of the drawings in which like reference numerals represent like elements and wherein:FIG. 1 is an example data network; FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an example processing system in order to show a processing system coupled to a data communications network;FIG. 3 is a block diagram of another example processing system in order to show
