<ABSTRACT>
In an apparatus for gel electrophoresis, a sample of 
fluorophore-labelled DNA fragments is caused to migrate by 

electrophoresis through a gel electrolyte layer in an electrophoresis 
plate 7 from top to bottom, thereby separating 

the sample into individual DNA fragments. A laser beam is 
launched horizontally into said electrolyte layer from one 

side of the electrophoresis plate 7 in a direction perpendicular 
to the longitudinal axis of said electrophoresis 

plate. The emitted fluorescenses are detected to determine 
the base sequences of the respective DNAs. A mirror 18 for 

reflecting fluorescenses is provided at the back of the electrophoresis 
plate 7 in such a way that it is parallel to the 

direction of laser beam application. The fluorescences reflected 
by this mirror 18 are received by a fluorescense detector 

22 such as a CCD sensor or MOS linear image sensor. In 
one embodiment, the mirror 18 is inclined by an angle of 45° 

with the electrophoresis plate 7 in such a way that it reflects 
the incident fluorescences upward, and the fluorescence 

detector 22 is positioned above the mirror 18 along the 
electrophoresis plate 7. In another embodiment, Texas Red 

having an excitation maximum wavelength of 596 nm and an 
emission maximum wavelength of 615 nm is used as the fluorophore 

and a He-Ne laser operating at a wavelength of 594 nm 
is used as a light source 10.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus for
electrophoresis. More particularly, this invention relates to
a compact vertical-type apparatus for gel electrophoresis.Gel electrophoresis is practiced extensively as a
technique for determining the base sequences of DNA and other
proteins. Conventionally, the sample to be subjected to
electrophoresis is labelled with a radioisotope for analysis
but this method has had the problem of being painstaking and
time-consuming. Furthermore, the use of radioactive
substances always calls for utmost safety and management and
analysis cannot be performed in areas other than facilities
that clear certain regulations. Under the circumstances, a
method that uses fluorophores to label the sample and which
detects fluorescences as emitted upon irradiation with light
is being reviewed.In this method, fluorophore-labelled DNA fragments are
caused to migrate through a gel and a light excitation portion
and a photodetector are provided for each electrophoresis
track in an area 15 - 20 cm below the start point of
electrophoresis. The DNA fragments are assayed as they pass
through the line connecting the light excitation portion and
the photodetector. A typical procedure of the method is
described below. First, using as template the DNA chain to be
determined for its base sequence, DNAs of various lengths with
known terminal base species are replicated by a method
involving an enzymatic reaction (the dideoxy method). Then,
the replicated DNAs are labelled with a fluorophore. Stated
more specifically, there are prepared a group of adenine (A)
fragments, a group of cytosine (C) fragments, a group of
guanine (G) fragments and a group of thymine (T) fragments,
all being labelled with a fluorophore. A mixture of these
fragment groups is injected into separate lane grooves in an
electrophoretic gel and, thereafter, a voltage is applied at
opposite ends of the gel. Since DNA is a chained polymer with
negative charges, it will move across the gel at a rate in 
inverse proportion to its molecular weight. The shorter the
DNA chain (the smaller its molecular weight), the faster will
it move and vice versa; this is the principle behind the
fractionation of DNA by molecular weight.Document EP-A-0 275 440

such a way that a line on the gel in an apparatus for
electrophoresis at which laser light is applied and the
direction in which photodiodes are arranged are both
perpendicular to the direction in which DNA fragments migrate
