A tyre comprising a bead (2) on both its 
sides, each bead (2) being defined by a substantially 

frustoconical seat (21) which is inclined slightly 
towards the outside of the inner cavity of the tyre 

with respect to the axis of the tyre, an inner edge 
(22), an inner side face (23) and an outer side face 

(24), the bead (2) being intended to be mounted 
radially on top of the seat of a rim comprising a 

flange oriented substantially perpendicular to the axis 
of rotation and a substantially frustoconical seat 

which is slightly inclined towards the inside of said 
rim with respect to the axis of the tyre, the inner 

side wall (23) being directed towards the inner cavity 
of the tyre and being of a shape corresponding 

substantially to the shape of the outer side face (24) 
in a zone opposite said flange of the rim on which the 

bead is intended to be mounted, the inner edge (22) 
forming a transition between said seat (21) and said 

inner side wall (23), the rigidity of the bead in 
rotation being greater than 5 mN/radian, characterised 

in that the inner edge (22) has a transition surface 
the inclination of which, measured by the tangent along 

the contour viewed in radial section, passes through an 
intermediate value between the inclination of the seat 

(21) and that of the inner side wall (23) and in that 
said inner edge (22) is without a rubber point at the 

transition between the seat (21) and the inner side 
face (23) of the bead (2). 
A tyre according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the inner edge (22) has a rounded shape in radial 

section. 
A tyre according to Claim 2, characterised in 
that the radius of curvature of said rounded shape is 

greater than or equal to 5 mm.  
 
A tyre according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the inner edge (22) has at least one conical 

bearing surface, the inclination of which is 
intermediate between the inclination of the seat (21) 

and that of the side wall (23). 
A tyre according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the zone (5) just adjacent to the 

inner edge (22), and included between said seat (21) 
and said inner side wall (23), does not comprise a 

reinforcement in the form of a textile strip or the 
like and is formed by material similar to that present 

above the rim seat. 
A tyre according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that at least the radially lower part 

of the inner side face (23) and part of the seat (21) 
of the bead located radially beneath the bead are 

moulded by the same reentrant moulding means, the other 
part of the bead seat being moulded by other moulding 

means.
