<ABSTRACT>
A novel electron beam apparatus window (35) having improved cooling 
associated therewith, which is in the form of heat pipes (37,39,41) 

located on the window of such apparatus for the cooling of such window 
by such heat pipes, whereby the heat pipes eliminates the need for air 

cooling and thus eliminate the production of ozone.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the art of electron beam 
accelerators and more particularly to the art of cooling such 
electron beam accelerators. Electron beam accelerators are used in a variety of 
environments. The most readily known environment is that of 
cathode ray tubes which in and of themselves have an extremely 
diverse variety of applications. While cathode ray tubes maintain accelerated electrons within 
the environment of the tube enclosure, applications exist for 
electron accelerators where the electrons must pass through a 
window for further utilization. Examples of this are applications 
such as crosslinking and grafting of polymeric materials, the 
curing of coatings and inks, the pasteurization of food stuffs or 
the sterilization of medical products wherein the electrons pass 
through a thin foil window to reach the product treatment area. Windows utilized in conventional electron beam accelerators 
in such applications are generally formed of a foil which is 
reasonably transparent to an electron beam. Generally such foils 
are formed of titanium or titanium alloys that are very thin, e.g. 
approximately 0.4 to 1.5 mils in thickness. In particular, a 
preferred alloy is formed of 96% (weight percent) titanium with 3% 
aluminum and 1% vanadium. When such windows are contacted by the accelerated electrons,  
 
a significant portion of the electron energy is imparted to the 
window resulting in heating thereof. This heat must be removed 
from the thin foil window or the window will overheat and melt 
resulting in catastrophic failure of the electron beam accelerator. Currently such windows are cooled by one of two methods. 
Water cooled support structures which are either ribbed or 
perforated cool the window by conduction. Such conduction cooling, 
however, has not been totally satisfactory since the windows have 
relatively short lives. A more effective method of window cooling utilizes a high 
velocity jet of air which passes over the exterior window surface. 
Windows cooled in this manner have long service lives, but there 
is a problem associated with the production of ozone when such air 
is irradiated by the electrons passing therethrough. There is thus a significant need for improvement with regard 
to the cooling of electron beam accelerator windows. It is thus an object of this invention to provide a novel 
electron beam apparatus window having improved cooling associated 
therewith. It is further an object of this invention to provide such an 
improvement which
