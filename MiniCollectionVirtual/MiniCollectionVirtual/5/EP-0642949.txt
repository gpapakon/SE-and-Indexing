Device for fixing a shell (C), especially of a
child's seat, to a seat part (P) of a motor vehicle in one

or other of two differently inclined positions, which
device is of the type comprising a male means (10) intended

to be associated with the shell (C) or seat part (P), a
female means (20) to receive the male means (10) by

displacement in a given direction (Δ) and which is intended
to be associated with the seat part (P) or shell (C), a

lock (40) with a catch (41) and a striker (42) which are
intended to engage and lock co-operating fastening means

(30) connected to the male means (10) and female means
(20), and a control means (50) for the lock allowing the

fastening means (30) to be engaged or separated in order,
respectively, to engage the male means (10) in the female

means (20) or to disengage it therefrom, 
characterized in
that
the male means (10) is constituted by a sole plate
(11), a shank (12) and an end-piece (13) with elongate axis

(100) having two opposed sides (130),
in that the female means (20) is constituted by a body
(21) with an opening (22) and having a seating (23) with

elongate axis (200) bounded by two opposed walls (230)
which are each intended to assume a position facing one of

the opposed sides (130) when the male means (10) is engaged
in the female means (20),
in that the fastening means (30) are borne by these
sides (130) and walls (230),
in that the catch (41) of the lock is associated with
the end-piece (13) and the striker (42) of the lock is

associated with the body (21), the striker (42) being movable
transversely with respect to the given direction (Δ)

from a normal median position towards one or other of two 
lateral positions in order to be inserted between one side

(130) and a facing wall (230) and to rest simultaneously
against the side (130) and facing wall (230) in order to

contribute to the engagement of the fastening means (30)
and to lock them,
and in that the control means (50) is connected to the
striker (42) in order to displace it longitudinally in the

given direction (Δ) starting from the normal median position
so as to introduce it between the side (130) and wall

(230) or to withdraw it therefrom.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the fastening means (30) comprise, projecting on each

of the sides (130), a tongue (31) with a ramp (311)
inclined relative to the axis (100) and diverging towards

the shank (12) and with a stop (312) substantially perpendicular
to the axis (100), and, projecting on each of the

walls (230), a lug (32) with a flank (321) inclined relative
to the axis (200) and diverging towards the opening

(22) and with a base (322) substantially perpendicular to
the axis (200).
Device according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that the catch (41) is formed of two depressions which

are each provided on one of the two opposed sides (130) of
the elongate end-piece (13) and in that the striker (42) is

a cylindrical roller (421) borne by a rod (422) connected
to the control means (50).
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the control means (50) comprises a

handle (51) mounted so as to be movable on the body (21).
Device according to Claim 4, characterized in
that the handle (51) carries guide columns (423) which are

subject to the action of return springs (424) and to which
is connected the rod (422) bearing the roller (421), an
d in
that the roller (421) is stressed resiliently.
Application of the device according to any one of
Claims 1 to 5, to a land motor vehicle, the seat part (P) 

of which is a movable part of a seat base (A).
