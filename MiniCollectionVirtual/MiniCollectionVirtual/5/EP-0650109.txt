<ABSTRACT>
A pressure reducer contains a housing part (10) with an inlet connection (12) and an outlet connection (14), a partition (16) between inlet connection (12) and outlet connection (14), which partition divides the internal space of the housing (10) into an inlet chamber (18) and an outlet chamber (20) and which has an aperture (22), and a stub (24) which is flush with the aperture (22), the stub being connected to the inlet chamber (18) and having an internal thread (32), and a pressure reducing insert (34) which is inserted into the stub (24) and the aperture (22). The pressure reducing insert (34) has an insert housing of funnel-shaped basic shape, which is closed off at its wide end by a control diaphragm (40) and forms a control pressure chamber (46), and also has a valve seat (48) which is held in the aperture (22) of the partition (16) in a sealing-off manner and is connected via webs (50) to the insert housing of the pressure reducing insert (34). The webs (50) contain ducts (52) which connect the outlet chamber (20) to the control pressure chamber (46). A tappet (54) which is connected to the control diaphragm (40) and a control diaphragm disc (60) extends through the valve seat (48) and carries at its end a valve disc (66) which interacts with the valve seat (48). A screw cap (42) is screwed by means of an external thread into the internal thread of the stub (24) and clamps the margin of the control diaphragm (40) firmly. The screw cap contains an adjustable spring counterbearing (64) and a prestressed helical spring (62) which is supported on the spring counterbearing (64) and bears on the control diaphragm disc (60) of the control diaphragm (40). A cylindrical dirt catching mesh (98) surrounds the pressure reducing insert (34) and is interchangeably held between the partition (16) and the insert housing of the pressure reducing insert (34). A tension anchor (102) extends through the spring counterbearing (64), is loosely connected at its control diaphragm end (104) to the tappet (54) in manner which does not impair the free mobility of the control diaphragm (40) and of the tappet (54) and carries, at its end (110) facing away from the control diaphragm (40), a stop element (112) which, in the operating position, is located at a distance from a stationary stop which is arranged at a distance from the stop element (112) on the control diaphragm side.
