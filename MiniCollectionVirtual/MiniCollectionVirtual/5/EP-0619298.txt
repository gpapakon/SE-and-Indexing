The invention is concerned with novel trisubstituted 
cycloalkane derivatives with useful pharmacological, particularly 
ulcus and gastric-acid-secretion inhibiting, effects, a 
process for preparing them as well as medicaments containing 
these compounds and the use of them. Some aminohydroxypropoxyimino derivatives have been known 
in the art. The fluorene derivative "IPS-339" of formula 
and the methyl cyclopropylketone derivative of formula 
known as Falintolol, exhibit beta-adrenergic blocking activity.  Published PCT patent application 8,402,908 describes carbostyrylketoxime 
derivatives possessing beta-adrenergic 
blocking activity. These compounds are useful in the treatment 
of glaucoma. Belgian patent specification 886,471 describes benzothiophene 
derivatives of general formula 
wherein 
Btrepresents a benzothiophene group
 
and Bstands for a basic group containing a 
nitrogen atom. Peraclopon of formula 
is a lipid level lowering agent, and Peradoxime of the formula 
has a hypotensive effect. US patent 4,652,586 relates to compounds of general formula 
VIII, wherein Bt is a fluorene group. The compounds reduce 
the inner pressure of eye and exhibit a selective β₂-adrenergic 
antagonist effect. Published German patent application 4,027,052 relates to 
disubstituted cycloalkane derivatives of formula 
wherein R stands for hydrogen or benzoyl and B is a basic 
group containing a nitrogen atom, possessing primarily antiarrhythmic 
properties. European patent 5,129 describes a new substituted benzimidazole  
 
derivative of formula 
which is the first representative of the compounds having 
H⁺/K⁺-ATP-ase inhibiting activity. Hungarian patent 194,244 describes compounds of general 
formula 
wherein n is 0 or 1, R₁ , R₂ and R₆ each represents hydrogen, 
alkyl or alkoxy and R₃ , R₄ and R₅ each stands for halogen, alkyl 
or alkoxy, exerting H⁺/K⁺-ATP-ase inhibiting effect. The problem underlying to the invention is to create novel 
trisubstituted cycloalkane derivatives showing valuable pharmacological 
properties, particularly ulcus and gastric-acid-secretion 
inhibiting effects, a process for preparing them as 
well as medicaments containing these compounds and the use of  
 
them. Surprisingly this has been solved by the invention. Thus a subject-matter of the invention are (phenylmethylene)-2-(alkyl)-1-[ω-(amino)-alkoxyimino]-cycloalkane
