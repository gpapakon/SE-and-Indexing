<ABSTRACT>
A circuit breaker rotary contact assembly employs a rotor
assembly (19) to operate the moveable contact arms (21, 22). Separate

pivots (20, 27) are provided to the rotor assembly (19) and the moveable
contact arms (21, 22) to ensure that the contacts (23, 24, 25, 26) close prior

to complete rotation of the rotor assembly (19). The additional rotation force
provided by the rotor assembly (19) then translates into lateral displacement

of the moveable contacts (23, 25) relative to the fixed contacts (24, 26),
resulting in contact wiping function. An alternate embodiment utilizes a

common pivot (27) for both the rotor assembly (19) and the moveable contact
arms (21, 22), while providing post closure motion by means of a fixed contact

compression spring (30).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to circuit breakers, and, more particularly, to a rotary contact assembly for high ampere-rated circuit breakers.U.S. Patent No. 4,616,198 entitled Contact Arrangement For A Current Limiting Circuit Breaker, describes the early use of a first and second pair of circuit breaker contacts arranged in series to substantially reduce the amount of current let-through upon the occurrence of an overcurrent condition. A more recent description is found within U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 09/087,038 filed May 29, 1998 entitled Rotary Contact Assembly For High Ampere-Rated Circuit Breakers.When the contact pairs are arranged upon one movable contact arm such as described within U.S. Patent No. 4,910,485 entitled Multiple Circuit Breaker With Double Break Rotary Contact, some means must be provided to insure that the opposing contact pairs provide a wiping action upon closure to remove any oxides or other contaminants developed upon the contact surfaces.One arrangement for providing such wiping motion within circuit breakers containing pivotally-arranged contacts is within U.S. Patent No. 5,361,051 entitled Pivoting Circuit Breaker Arm Assembly. This arrangement includes an elongate slot formed within the moveable contact arm to provide wiping action upon contact closure. Early teachings of the use of a slotted moveable contact arm for wiping the circuit breaker contacts is found within U.S. Patent No. 4,756,628 entitled Circuit Breaker, as well as U.S. Patent No. 4,484,164 entitled Braidless Movable Contact With Wiping Action.In so-called "vacuum" circuit interrupters, wherein continuous wiping of the contact surfaces is imperative to long term operation, the wiping motion is achieved by the addition of a wiping spring in addition to the contact closing springs for continued motion of the contacts in the parallel plane after the closing springs have initially become engaged. One example of a wiping spring used within vacuum circuit breakers is found in Canadian Patent No. CA 1,098,570 entitled Contact Controller For Vacuum-Type Circuit Interrupter.The Document "EP-A-0 889 498" discloses a circuit breaker moveable contact assembly according to the preamble of claim 1 and 9.It would be economically advantageous to provide rotary contacts with wiping action upon contact closure without having to employ elongated pivot openings within the contact arms and without having to employ an auxiliary wiping spring.In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, automatic contact wiping between

A circuit breaker moveable contact assembly comprising:

a rotor assembly (19) having a first pair of slots (28) on opposing perimeters;
a moveable contact arm (21, 22) having a moveable contact (23, 25) arranged on opposition ends and a contact pivot (27) through a central portion thereof; and
a spring assembly (30) attached between said rotor assembly slots connecting said contact arm to said rotor assembly; 
characterised in that
 it comprises a rotor assembly pivot (20) through a non-central portion of the rotor assembly (19).
The contact assembly of claim 1 including a fixed contact (24, 26) arranged proximate said moveable contact (23, 25).
The contact assembly of claim 2 whereby rotation of said rotor assembly (19) and said moveable contact arm (21, 22) drives said moveable contact (23, 25) into contact with said fixed contact (24, 26).
The contact assembly of claim 2 whereby further rotation of said rotor assembly (19) upon completed rotation of said moveable contact arm (21, 22) moves said moveable contact (23, 25) along a mating surface of said fixed contact (24, 26) to provide contact wiping action.
The contact assembly of claim 2, 3 or 4, wherein said fixed contact (24, 26) is longer than said moveable contact (23, 25).
The contact assembly of claim 4 wherein said rotor assembly pivot (20) is spaced from said moveable contact arm (21, 22) a predetermined distance
 of motion for said moveable contact (23, 25) along said mating surface of said fixed contact (24, 26).
The contact assembly of claim 1 wherein said spring assembly (30) comprise a plurality of extension springs (30) arranged on opposite surfaces of said rotor assembly (19).
The contact assembly of claim 7 wherein said rotor assembly (19) comprises a pair of circular rotors, one of said being arranged on either side of said moveable contact arm.
A circuit breaker moveable contact assembly comprising:

a rotor assembly (19) having a first pair of slots (28) on opposing perimeters and a rotor assembly pivot (20) through a central portion thereof;
a moveable contact arm (21, 22) having a moveable contact (23, 25) arranged on opposite ends and a contact pivot (27) through a central portion of said rotor assembly (19);
a rotor assembly spring (30) attached between said rotor assembly slots (28) connecting said contact arm (21, 22) to said rotor assembly (19) for allowing motion of said moveable contact arm (21, 22) relative to said rotor assembly (19); 
characterised in that
 it comprises
a fixed contact assembly having a fixed contact (24, 26) arranged opposite said moveable contact (23, 25), said fixed contact assembly including a fixed contact compression spring (32) subjacent said fixed contact (24, 26).
The contact assembly of claim 9 wherein said fixed contact assembly includes a receptacle (31), said fixed contact (24, 26) and said compression spring (32) being received within said receptacle (31).
The contact assembly of claim 9 wherein said fixed contact (24, 26) is longer than said moveable contact (23, 25) for providing relative motion between said moveable contact (23, 25) and said fixed contact (24, 26) when said compression spring (32) becomes compressed upon impact between said moveable contact (23, 25) and said fixed contact (24, 26).
The contact assembly of claim 11 wherein relative motion between said moveable contact (23, 25) and said fixed contact (24, 26) provides contact wiping action.
