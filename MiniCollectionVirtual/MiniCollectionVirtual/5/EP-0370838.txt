Process for the surface protection of a nickel-, cobalt- and/or 
iron-based metallic substrate, comprising a 

preplating treatment followed by a plating treatment, the 
plating treatment comprising the plating and/or the 

diffusion of aluminium on the surface of the pretreated 
substrate and the preplating treatment comprising one or 

more successive phases during which the material is applied 
by plating and/or diffusion on the surface of the 

substrate, where the composition of the added material can 
vary from phase to phase and the said material contains 

palladium during at least one phase, characterised in that 
palladium is the only platinum-ore metal present in the 

material and that this material contains, during all phases 
for which it contains palladium and/or at least one 

subsequent phase of the preplating treatment, at least one 
of the barrier metals nickel, cobalt or chromium. 
Process in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that 
during the plating treatment, the pretreated substrate is 

brought into contact with a plating material containing 
aluminium and chromium. 
Process in accordance with Claim 2, characterised in that 
the plating treatment is a high-activity aluminisation. 
Process in accordance with Claim 2, characterised in that 
the plating treatment is a low-activity aluminisation. 
Process in accordance with any of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that at least one phase of the preplating 

treatment includes an operation for the low-temperature 
plating of the added material followed by a high-temperature 

diffusion operation under vacuum.  
 
Process in accordance with Claim 5, characterised in that 
the diffusion operation is carried out at a temperature of 

approximately 850°C under an air pressure at most equal to 
1.3 mPa (10⁻⁵ torr). 
Process in accordance with any of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that at least one phase of the preplating 

treatment includes the plating and/or the diffusion of an 
alloy of palladium and at least one barrier metal. 
Process in accordance with Claim 7, characterised in that 
the preplating treatment includes a single plating phase. 
Process in accordance with any of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that in a first phase of the preplating 

treatment, the plating material is formed essentially of 
palladium and that in a second phase subsequent to the 

first, the plating material is formed essentially of at 
least one barrier metal. 
Process in accordance with Claim 9, characterised in that 
the first and second phases are immediately consecutive. 
Process in accordance with Claim 10, characterised in that 
the preplating treatment comprises two plating phases. 
Process in accordance with any of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the substrate is nickel-based, that 

the aluminiure is essentially a nickel aluminiure and the 
barrier metal is essentially nickel. 
Process in accordance with one of Claims 7 and 8, 
characterised in that the said alloy consists of a weight 

proportion of approximately 80% palladium and 20% nickel.  
 
Process in accordance with Claim 13, characterised in that 
the said alloy is applied by electrolysis. 
Process in accordance with one of Claims 9 to 11, 
characterised in that the plating material of the first 

phase is essentially palladium and that of the second phase 
is essentially nickel. 
Process in accordance with Claim 15, characterised in that 
the palladium is applied by chemical autocatalysis and the 

nickel by triode cathodic evaporation. 
Nickel-, cobalt- and/or iron-based metallic component, 
protected by the process in accordance with one of the 

preceding claims. 
Component in accordance with Claim 17, characterised in 
that it is designed to form one of the hot parts of a 

turbo-engine.
