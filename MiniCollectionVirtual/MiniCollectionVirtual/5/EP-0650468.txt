<ABSTRACT>
There is now provided a method of manufacturing a coated ceramic body with improved performance when used as a tool insert for metal cutting purposes. By subjecting the body after the coating to a hot isostatic pressing operation at a pressure of 10-300 MPa and a temperature of 
>
 1200  C, an improved adherence of the coating has been achieved. The method is particularly applicable to whisker-reinforced ceramic composites.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of improving the adhesion of 
wear resistant surface coatings on whisker-reinforced ceramics resulting in improved 
performance of the coated product. Cutting tool inserts made from SiC-whisker-reinforced alumina are an 
established product on the cutting tool market and are mainly used in cutting heat resistant 
materials and, to some extent, for use in cutting cast iron. However, when used for 
cutting steel and other iron-rich alloys SiC-whisker-reinforced alumina exhibits poor tool 
life time. It is believed that these poor tool lives are due to a strong chemical reaction 
which occurs between the iron in the steel and the silicon carbide whiskers in the cutting 
insert at the high temperatures produced at the cutting edge during machining. From, 
e.g., U.S. Patent 4,801,510, it is known that this kind of attack is reduced by an 
application of a wear resistant surface coating. This improves the whisker-reinforced 
ceramic cutting tool insert's performance in the cutting of steel and other iron-rich alloys. 
However, it is difficult to provide sufficient adherence of the surface coating and, for that 
reason, the area of application of coated SiC-whisker-reinforced alumina cutting inserts 
has been restricted. Hot isostatic pressing (HIP-treatment) using various encapsulating methods 
to facilitate the isostatic pressing operation is well-known. For example, U.S. Patent 
4,820,663 discloses a method of manufacturing a shaped, whisker-reinforced ceramic 
body of near theoretical density comprising forming a compact, encapsulating the compact 
by applying a coating by vapor deposition, heating and isostatically pressing the 
encapsulated compact in an atmosphere that reacts with the coating and/or compact  
 
substrate to increase the density of the resulting body. To make a cutting tool from that 
body, the coating is ground away and the body is shaped into a cutting tool insert having 
a cutting edge forward at the junction of a rake face and a flank face. It is an object of this invention to avoid or alleviate the problems of the 
prior art. It is further an object of this invention to provide a method of improving 
the adhesion of wear resistant surface coatings on whisker reinforced ceramics. The present invention provides a method of manufacturing 
a coated ceramic body as described in Claim 1. 
Preferred embodiments of the invention are described in 
Claims 2 to 5. It has now been found that the adherence of a surface coating on a ceramic 
body can be
