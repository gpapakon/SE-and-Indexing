<ABSTRACT>
An IV injection site (10; 10A) adapted to receive a blunt cannula (12). The injection site (10; 10A) comprises a housing (16; 16A) having a passageway (20; 20A) extending inwardly from its outside end (18; 18A), and an elastomeric septum (22; 22A) closely received in the passageway of the housing (16; 16A). The septum (22; 22A) has a bore (28; 28A) extending into the septum (22; 22A) from the inside end (24) of the septum (22; 22A) but not through the septum, and a slit extending generally in the axial direction into the septum (22; 22A) from the outside end (18; 18A) of the septum (22; 22A) to the bore (28; 28A). When a cannula (12) is introduced through the slit (30; 30A) of the septum (22; 22A), the elastomeric material of the septum (22; 22A) is displaced into the bore (28; 28A) of the septum (22; 22A) to sealingly engage the cannula (12) along the bore (28; 28A) of the septum (22; 22A).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to infusion 
therapy and IV injection sites, and more particularly to 
an IV injection site adapted for use with a blunt cannula 
as described in claims 1 and 12. In an effort to reduce the risk of transmitting 
infectious diseases, such as hepatitis and AIDS, via 
accidental needle sticks, various designs of IV injection 
sites have been developed that are adapted to receive a 
blunt cannula and/or shielded cannula. See, e.g., Special 
Report and Product Review, Needlestick-Prevention Devices, 
Health Devices, pages 154-180 (ECRI, Plymouth Meeting, 
Pennsylvania, U.S.A. 1991). One approach has been to 
employ a slit septum Y-site in which a slit elastomeric 
septum is compressed in the Y-site housing. A blunt 
cannula can be introduced through the slit of the septum, 
and assuming the design works as intended, the septum will 
seal against the cannula shaft. When the cannula is 
removed, the septum seals itself. Injection sites of this type are either 
available from or publicized by Baxter International, 
Inc., Deerfield, Illinois, U.S.A., under the trade 
designation "Baxter's Needle-Less Injection Sites"; Abbott 
Laboratories, Inc., Abbott Park, Illinois, U.S.A., under 
the trade designation "LifeShield Infection Control 
System"; and Kendall McGaw Laboratories, Inc., Irvine, 
California, U.S.A., under the trade designation "SafeLine 
No-Needle I.V. System". A blunt cannula has been 
available from Becton, Dickinson and Company, Paramus, New 
Jersey, U.S.A., under the trade designation "Interlink 
System". One problem with these systems is that 
they are sometimes incompatible. Some slit septum 
systems have permitted leakage either when a cannula is 
inserted or when no cannula has been inserted. In at 
least one slit septum site, it is possible to upset the 
septum in its housing by using an unspecified cannula or  
 
attempting to insert the cannula through the material of 
the septum somewhere other than through the slit. PCT Publication No. WO-A 91/07206 discloses a 
bayonet lock cannula for pre-slit Y-site. That Y-site 
includes a generally cylindrical septum to which axial 
forces are applied by swaging swaged end members, thereby 
creating a domed exterior peripheral surface and slightly 
deforming a region of the septum into a channel. The Y-site 
described in that PCT publication is available under 
the trademark "INTERLINK" from Baxter International Inc., 
Deerfield, Illinois, U.S.A. PCT Publication No. WO-A 91/10459 discloses a 
hemostasis valve
