<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to saccharin derivatives which inhibit the
enzymatic activity of proteolytic enzymes, to processes for preparation thereof, to
method of use thereof in treatment of degenerative diseases and to pharmaceutical
compositions thereof.Inhibitors of proteolytic enzymes are useful in treatment of
degenerative disorders such as emphysema, rheumatoid arthritis and pancreatic in
which proteolysis is a substantive element. Serine proteases are the most widely
distributed class of proteolytic enzymes. Some serine proteases are characterized
as chymotrypsin-like or elastase-like based upon their substrate specificity.
Chymotrypsin and chymotrypsin-like enzymes normally cleave a peptide bond in a
protein at a site at which the amino acid on the carbonyl side is Trp, Tyr, Phe, Met,
Leu or other amino acid which contains an aromatic or a large alkyl side chain.
Elastase and elastase-like enzymes normally cleave a peptide bond at a site at which
the amino acid residue on the carbonyl side of the bond is Ala, Val, Ser, Leu or
other small amino acid. Both chymotrypsin-like and elastase-like enzymes are
found in leukocytes, mast cells and pancreatic juice in higher organisms, and are
secreted by many types of bacteria, yeast and parasites.Dunlap et al. WO-A-9013549 describes a series of
2-substituted saccharin derivatives useful as proteolytic enzyme inhibitors.Barber et al., US-A-2,855,401 disclose compounds of the
formula:

wherein R1 and R2 are each selected from hydrogen, lower-alkyl and lower
hydroxyalkyl, n is an integer from 5 to 9 and R3 is a group selected from
methanesulphonamido, benzenesulphonamido and o-sulphonbenzimido. The
compounds are said to be useful in the treatment of bilharziasis. Brown et al., US-A-3,220,940 disclose the use in acidic
nickel baths of the compounds of the formula:

or the Ni, Na, Co, K, Li, Mg, etc. sulfonate salts thereof, wherein
A is selected from the group consisting of the benzene, biphenyl and napthalene
rings, R is selected from the group consisting of H, OH, Cl, Br, SO3H and CH3,
n is an integer from 1 to 4 inclusive, n1 is 0 or 1, n2 is zero, 1 or 2, and when
n2 is zero then n1 is zero.Sunket et al., EP-A-253092 disclose
2-saccharinyl-lower-alkyl-1,4-dihydropyridine-3-carboxylates having platelet
aggregation inhibitory and antithrombotic activities. A substantially similar
disclosure can be found in Sunket et al., J. Med. Chem. 31, 1886-1890 (1988).Mulvey et al., US-A-4,195,023 disclose
R1-2-R2 CO-1,2-benzisothiazol-3-ones, where R1 is halogen, alkoxy,
