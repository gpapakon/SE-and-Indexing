<ABSTRACT>
The invention features a method for assaying the 
ability of an oligonucleotide to form a hybrid with a 

target nucleic acid sequence. The featured assay comprises 
the following steps: (a) contacting a test sample 

containing a target nucleic acid sequence with an oligonucleotide; 
(b) treating the test sample with a duplex-altering 

agent; (c) contacting the treated test sample 
with a labeled probe under stringent hybridization conditions, 

wherein the probe can hybridize to non-altered 
target nucleic acid sequence such that the probe label is 

protected from subsequent chemical inactivation but the 
probe cannot hybridize to altered target nucleic acid 

sequence in a manner which would protect the probe label 
from subsequent chemical inactivation; and (d) measuring 

the hybridization of the probe to non-altered target 
nucleic acid sequence by measuring the amount of protected 

label. Also described is an assay to measure the ability 
of a ribozyme to cleave a target nucleic acid sequence, 

and an assay to measure the ability of an agent to alter 
nucleic acid.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns assays for measuring the 
ability of an oligonucleotide to hybridize to a target 
nucleic acid sequence, and the ability of an agent to 
alter a nucleic acid sequence. These assays are particularly 
useful for measuring the ability of an antisense 
oligonucleotide to hybridize to a target sequence, or a 
ribozyme to hybridize and cleave a target sequence, under 
essentially physiological conditions. Antisense oligonucleotides and ribozymes can hybridize 
to a target RNA, such as mRNA, and inhibit production 
of protein from the mRNA. A ribozyme can hybridize to its 
target site and inhibit production of protein from mRNA by 
cleaving mRNA. Numerous mechanisms have been proposed to explain the 
effects of antisense oligonucleotides. For example, see 
Helene and Toulme, Biochimica et Biophysica Acta1049:99 
(1990), and Uhlmann and Peyman, Chemical Reviews90:543 
(1990). These mechanisms include forming a DNA:RNA substrate 
for cellular RNAse H which degrades the RNA strand 
involved in the duplex; hybridization of antisense oligonucleotides 
to nascent mRNAs leading to premature transcription 
termination; and interfering with mRNA processing 
by hybridizing to a pre-mRNA intron/exon junction. 
These mechanisms are based upon the ability of an antisense 
oligonucleotide to hybridize to its target nucleic 
acid sequence. Hybridization of an oligonucleotide to a target 
nucleic acid sequence is thought to occur by hydrogen 
bonding between complementary nucleotides present on the 
oligonucleotide and the target nucleic acid sequence. If 
the individual nucleotides on the target nucleic acid 
sequence are not accessible to the oligonucleotide  
 
hybridization will be prevented. Inaccessibility of a 
target nucleic acid sequence can be due to various 
factors, including the secondary structure of the target 
nucleic acid sequence or the oligonucleotide, and proteins 
associated with those nucleic acids. Factors other than inaccessibility can affect hybridization 
of an oligonucleotide to a target nucleic acid 
sequence. Additional factors include the degree of 
complementarity between the oligonucleotide and the target 
nucleic acid sequence, and the hybridization conditions. Various procedures are available for determining the 
ability of an oligonucleotide to hybridize to a target 
sequence. Some of these procedures involve hybridizing a 
labeled oligonucleotide to a target site and then physically 
separating the formed duplex from non-hybridized 
labeled oligonucleotide.
