<ABSTRACT>
A multiple charged-particle detector system includes 
a plurality of charged-particle detector assemblies (10-12) 

which are each made up of a first arm (19-22) and a 
second arm (24-27) extending at an angle to each other. 

Charged particles (4-7) enter an aperture (14-18) at the 
entrance of the first arm (19-22) of each detector 

assembly (10-12) and strike a dynode (30-33) positioned 
at the intersection of the two arms causing electrons to 

be emitted by the dynode (30-33). Some of the electrons 
pass into the second arms (24-27) of the detector 

assemblies (10-12) and are detected by a continuous-dynode 
electron multiplier (35-38). The first arms (19-22) 

are narrower than the detectors (35-38), and the 
detector assemblies (10-12) are arranged in such a way 

that the minimum separation at which charged-particle 
beams (4-7) can be detected is determined by the widths 

of the said first arms (19-22) of the detector assemblies 
(10-12), and not by the widths of the detectors (35-38) 

themselves.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to multiple-detector systems 
for detecting charged particles. It is particularly, 
although not exclusively, relevant to multiple-detector 
systems used in spectrometers, for example Isotope-Ratio 
Mass Spectrometers which are used for the determination 
of the isotopic composition of materials. Many analytical devices involve the simultaneous 
detection of charged particles at a plurality of 
locations. In order to do this, an array of charged-particle 
detectors may be used. The minimum size of 
these detectors is a limiting factor in determining the 
minimum spacing apart at which the detectors may be 
positioned, and thus the minimum spacing at which 
particles may be detected, and this spatial limitation 
poses a problem which must be solved in designing the 
device. Another frequent requirement of multiple-detector 
systems is that the detectors be adjustable in 
their relative positions, so that charged particles may 
be simultaneously detected at a plurality of locations, 
the spacings of which locations may be varied. An 
example of a field in which both these requirements must 
be met is isotope-ratio mass spectrometry. Isotope-ratio mass spectrometers are well known in 
the prior art. Typically, such an arrangement will 
consist of an ion source for generating a beam of ions 
which are characteristic of the element (or elements) in 
the sample to be analyzed; a mass analyzer for dispersing 
the ions in the beam to follow different trajectories 
according to their mass-to-charge ratios; and a plurality 
of ion detectors, each of which is positioned to detect 
ions of a particular mass-to-charge ratio. The mass  
 
analyzer, for example a sector magnet, effectively 
separates the incident ion beam into a plurality of 
dispersed beams which are focused at different points on 
the focal plane of the magnet, the points at which 
particular particle beams are focused on the focal plane 
being determined by the mass-to-charge ratios of the 
particles. In such a device, a plurality of particle 
beams may be detected simultaneously, giving a rapid and 
accurate measurement of the isotopic composition. For a given mass spectrometer configuration, the 
spacing between the positions at which ions are detected 
will vary depending upon the different mass-to-charge 
ratios of the various isotope beams to be measured. 
Typically, the distance between isotope beams to be 
detected is in the range of a few millimetres, so that 
the detectors employed must be capable of detecting ion 
be
