<ABSTRACT>
A programmable analog multi-channel probe system is embedded within 
a device under test for coupling test points to external measurement points of the 

device under test. Programmable input buffer amplifiers are coupled to the test 
points to couple the data at those points to their outputs when enabled. The data 

from the input buffer amplifiers are input to respective routers to provide a 
plurality of outputs. Each common output from the routers is coupled as an input 

to an output buffer amplifier that provides the data as an output when enabled. 
The data at the output of the output buffer amplifiers is converted to a 

differential signal for transmission to the external measurement point by 
differential input/output amplifiers that have a reference level, selected from a 

plurality of reference levels including an internal reference level, as an input for 
comparison with the data from the output buffer amplifiers. A termination circuit 

may be provided for each output to provide appropriate impedance interface with 
the measurement points.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to analog probe systems, and more
particularly to an analog multi-channel probe system for embedment into a device
under test (DUT) that provides for high speed analog and digital signals to be
routed to points where they may be measured by conventional methods.There exist today several integrated circuits that are controlled by a
standard IEEE 1149.1 boundary scan interface. Current boundary scan based
methods of testing integrated circuits work well where the integrated circuits to
be tested are static and digital, but fall short when at-speed or analog testing is
required. Optimum solutions to these problems would be to embed an
"oscilloscope-on-a-chip" and a "VLSI-tester-on-a-chip" into the integrated circuit
or system to be tested (DUT). Unfortunately such chips presently do not have
the price/performance levels required to make them practical for most
applications. Also many potential test points are externally inaccessible due to
the spacing of leads on integrated circuits, the density of parts on a printed circuit
board, or the burying of such points within a multi-layer multi-chip module or
printed circuit board. Therefore testing with conventional instruments and
automated test equipment (ATE) is possible only at interfaces where the circuit
or board connections are accessible.What is needed is an analog multi-channel probe system for providing data
from inaccessible test points to points that are accessible for measurement by
conventional test and measurement instruments. EP-A-0 481 703 relates to a structure including test circuitry formed
on and within a substrate. This document describes a device under test and an embedded analog multi-channel probe system
formed on the same substrate, the analog multi-channel probe system comprising:
input buffer amplifiers having an input coupled to a test point of a device under test, an output and a
control terminal by which the input buffer amplifier can be selectively enabled, whereby when the input
buffer amplifier is enabled it provides a test signal at its output; anda test signal selector means comprising analog switches to convey the signal of selected test points to
selected outputs.Accordingly the present invention provides a system comprising a
device under test and an embedded analog multi-channel test probe system as
set out in claim 1.The objects, advantages and other novel features of the present
invention are apparent from the following detailed description when read in
conjunction with the appended claims
