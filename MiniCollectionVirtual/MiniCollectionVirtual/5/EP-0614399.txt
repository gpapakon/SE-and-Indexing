<ABSTRACT>
Oxidation catalyst compositions include a catalytic material containing ceria and alumina each having a surface area of at least about 10 m
<
2
>
/g, for example, ceria and activated alumina in a weight ratio of from about 1.5:1 to 1:1.5. Optionally, platinum may be included in the catalytic material in amounts which are sufficient to promote gas phase oxidation of CO and HC but which are limited to preclude excessive oxidation of SO2 to SO3. Alternatively, palladium in any desired amount may be included in the catalytic material. The catalyst compositions have utility as oxidation catalysts for pollution abatement of exhausts containing unburned fuel or oil. For example, the catalyst compositions may be used in a method to treat diesel engine exhaust by contacting the hot exhaust with the catalyst composition to promote the oxidation of the volatile organic fraction component of particulates in the exhaust.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a catalyst composition and
method for the oxidation of oxidizeable components of a
gas-borne stream, e.g., for the treatment of diesel engine
exhaust, and more specifically to the treatment of such
diesel exhaust to reduce the particulates content thereof.As is well-known, gas-borne streams or engine exhausts
often contain oxidizeable pollutants such as unburned
fuel and vaporized or condensed oils. For example,
diesel engine exhaust contains not only gaseous pollutants
such as carbon monoxide ("CO") and unburned hydrocarbons
("HC"), but also soot particles which, as described in
more detail below, comprise both a dry carbonaceous fraction
and a hydrocarbon liquid which is sometimes referred
to as a volatile organic fraction ("VOF"), which terminology
will be used herein, or a soluble organic fraction.
Accordingly, although sometimes loosely referred to as an
"exhaust gas", the exhaust of a diesel engine is actually
a heterogeneous material, comprising gaseous, liquid and
solid components. The VOF may exist in diesel exhaust
either as a vapor or as an aerosol (fine droplets of liquid
condensate) depending on the temperature of the diesel
exhaust.Oxidation catalysts comprising a platinum group metal
dispersed on a refractory metal oxide support are known
for use in treating the exhaust of diesel engines in order
to convert both HC and CO gaseous pollutants and particulates, 
i.e., soot particles, by catalyzing the oxidation
of these pollutants to carbon dioxide and water. One
problem faced in the treatment of diesel engine exhaust is
presented by the presence of sulfur in diesel fuel. Upon
combustion, sulfur forms sulfur dioxide and the oxidation
catalyst catalyzes the SO2 to SO3 ("sulfates") with subsequent
formation of sulfuric acid. The sulfates also react
with activated alumina supports to form aluminum sulfates,
which render activated alumina-containing catalysts inactive.
In this regard, see U.S. Patent 4,171,289 at column
1, line 39 et seq. Previous attempts to deal with the
sulfation problem include the incorporation of large
amounts of sulfate-resistant materials such as vanadium
oxide into the support coating, or the use of alternative
support materials such as α-alumina, silica and titania,
which are sulfation-resistant materials. Further, as is
known, the oxidation of SO2 to SO3 also adds to the particulates
in the exhaust by forming condensible sulfur compounds,
such as sulfuric acid, which condense upon, and
thereby add to, the mass of particulates.Generally, the
