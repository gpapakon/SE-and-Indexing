<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to dry powder inhalation 
devices. Asthma and other respiratory diseases have long 
been treated by inhalation of medicament. For many 
years, the two most widely used and convenient choices 
of treatment have been inhalation of medicament from a 
drug solution or suspension in an aerosol propellent 
from a metered dose pressurized inhaler, or inhalation 
of powdered drug, generally admixed with a powdered 
excipient, from a dry powder inhaler. With growing 
concern being voiced over the strong link between 
depletion of the earth's ozone layer and 
chlorofluorocarbon emissions, the use of these 
materials as aerosol propellants in pressurized 
inhalers is being questioned and interest in dry powder 
systems has been stimulated. Most single and multiple dose dry powder inhalers 
use either individual premeasured doses of medicament 
which are inserted into a dispensing chamber prior to 
use, or they incorporate a bulk powder reservoir from 
which successive quantities of medicament are 
transferred to the dispensing chamber. Such inhalers 
generally comprise an air passage leading from the 
dispensing chamber which terminates in a patient port 
adapted to be inserted into the mouth or nasal passage 
of the patient. Patient inhalation at the patient port 
generates an air stream through the dispensing chamber 
which carries particles of medicament into the lungs of 
the patient. Examples of such dry powder inhalers are disclosed 
in U.S. Patent Nos. 2,587,215, 3,669,113, 3,948,264, 
3,971,377, 4,046,146, 4,098,273, 4,137,914, 4,147,166,  
 
4,192,309, 4,240,418, 4,674,491, 4,846,168; British 
Patent Nos. 1,118,341, 1,268,051, 1,526,303, 2,041,763, 
2,061,735, 2,165,159, and 2,191,718; European Patent 
No. 237507 and International Patent No. WO 90/07351. A problem common to many dry powder systems is the 
tendency of the powdered medicament to agglomerate. 
Agglomeration is caused by individual particles of 
medicament adhering together in a semi-rigid mass, and 
requires an increased inspiratory effort by the patient 
to separate and entrain drug particles into the air 
stream. If the patient is unable to provide sufficient 
inspiratory effort the extent of drug penetration into 
the lower airways of the lung will be reduced. Larger 
agglomerated drug particles (> 10 µm) which result from 
inefficient aerosolization are not stably entrained 
into the patient's air stream and prematurely deposit 
in the mouth or throat region which may lead to 
unwanted systemic side effects,

<CLAIMS>
A dry powder inhaler (2) for dispensing powdered 
medicament (26) comprising a housing (4) defining a chamber (6) for 

receiving a dose of powdered medicament (26), one or more 
air inlets, and a patient port (8) adapted for insertion 

into the mouth or nasal passage of the patient, 
constructed and arranged to provide an air passage 

extending from the air inlet(s) (36) through the chamber (6) to 
the patient port (8) so that patient inhalation at the 

patient port (8) generates an airstream through the inhaler 
which entrains particles of medicament (26) from the chamber (6) 

for inhalation by the patient, 
the air passage being provided with one or more 

deagglomeration channel(s) (52) between the chamber (6) and 
patient port through which the airstream with entrained 

medicament (26) must pass, 
a first 

opening (54) communicating with the dispensing chamber (6), a 
second opening (56) communicating with the patient port, 

characterized in that  
 

each channel has a 
substantially constant cross-sectional profile with a 

cross-sectional area no greater than 40 mm², 
and 

intermediate of said first and second openings either: 

(i) a single bend of from 70 to 160° wherein the 
minimum radius of curvature of the center of the bend 

is no greater than 10 mm, or 
(ii) two or more bends each of 35 to 200°, wherein 
the minimum radius of curvature of the center of the 

bends is no greater than 10 mm.

which the minimum radius of curvature of the center of 

the bend(s) is no greater than 5 mm. 
A dry powder inhaler as claimed in Claim 4 in 
which the minimum radius of curvature of the center of 

the bend(s) is from 1.5 to 5 mm.

which the deagglomeration channel(s) is formed with a 

first bend of about 150° and a second bend of about 
135°. 
A dry powder inhaler as claimed in Claim 1 in 
which the overall path length between the first and 

second openings of the deagglomeration channel(s) is no 
greater than 4 cm. 
A dry powder inhaler as claimed in Claim 1 in 
which the deagglomeration channel(s) has a slot shaped 

profile of length 8 to 30 mm and width 1 to 2.5 mm.

which the slot has a central aperture to provide a 

route for air at high(er) flow rates.
