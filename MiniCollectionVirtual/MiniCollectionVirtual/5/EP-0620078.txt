<ABSTRACT>
In the device for automatically supplying, loading and evacuating workpieces at machine tools, in particular gear-cutting machines or the like, a manipulating appliance 4 is provided which has three work-gripping units 1, 2 and 3 which are offset at an angle to one another and which, by means of a common, combined swivelling and reciprocating mechanism 9, 10, can be pivoted cyclically between three positions about a pivot axis 5 running parallel to the rotation axis 20 of a work spindle 13 and can be displaced up and down in the direction of their pivot axis 5. This ensures that the gripping units 1, 2, 3 move one after the other into a first position, i.e. a position of the receptacle for unmachined workpieces, then into a second position, i.e. a loading position for loading the respectively accommodated workpiece into a clamping device 7, and finally into a third position, i.e. a depositing position for depositing the finish-machined workpiece 8. Automatic supplying, loading and evacuating of workpieces with short change times, low capital expenditure, simple operational control and reduced personnel costs as well as considerable adaptability in use are guaranteed by the novel device, in particular during the machining of workpieces.
