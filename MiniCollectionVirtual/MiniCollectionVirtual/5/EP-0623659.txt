<ABSTRACT>
This invention is directed to use of a multi-staged latex in a coating to 
improve the water whitening resistance of the coating. The multi-staged latex 

preferably comprises from about 50 to about 95 percent by weight of at least one 
first polymer stage having a Tg from about 0°C to about -30°C and from about 5 to 

about 50 percent by weight of at least one second polymer stage having a Tg from 
about 0°C to about 80°C. The multi-staged latex is preferably in the form of 

aqueous coating compositions, such as for example, sealers, renderings, caulks, 
sealants, adhesives and floor polishes. A process for making the multi-staged 

latex is also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to use of a multi-staged latex. This invention also 
relates to a process for making the multi-staged latex. In general, the multi-staged 
latex acts as a binder. Exterior aqueous coatings, such as for example, "sealers" and "renderings", 
are subjected to a wide variety of extreme weather conditions, such as rain, sleet, and 
snow. "Sealer" as used hereinafter, refers to a clear, unfilled polymeric coating, 
which is applied to a substrate, such as for example, wood, concrete and plaster, to 
protect the surface of the substrate and enhance its appearance. "Rendering", as 
used hereinafter, refers to a non-pigmented coating, consisting primarily of latex 
binder and decorative filler. Under these weather conditions, sealers and 
renderings are in contact with water for extended periods of time. Since these 
coatings are water-based they tend to "whiten", often considerably, on contact with 
water. This whitening is aesthetically undesirable. "Water whitening resistance" as used hereinafter, refers to the resistance of a 
coating to whitening during contact with water. Water whitening is a particular 
concern for coatings which are unpigmented, such as sealers and renderings, 
because the whitening is noticeable and visually unappealing. Water whitening is 
an additional concern for sealers and renderings applied over dark colored 
substrates and in renderings made with dark colored fillers. The aim of the present invention is to improve water whitening resistance of 
coatings. In accordance with the present invention, there is provided use of a multi-staged 
latex in a coating to improve the water whitening resistance of the coating. In a second aspect of the invention, there is provided a process for 
producing the multi-staged latex by polymerizing in at least one first stage at least 
one ethylenically unsaturated monomer, followed by polymerizing in at least 
one second stage at least one ethylenically unsaturated monomer, both stages 
being polymerized at a pH of less than 6.0.  When the multi-staged latex is used in coatings it provides good water 
whitening resistance. It also provides a good balance of water whitening resistance, 
film formation characteristics, and properties suitable for applications requiring 
flexibility. Use of a multi-staged latex in a coating has unexpectedly been found to be 
superior to the use of either a single staged latex of the same overall composition or 
a blend of separately prepared single staged latexes in a coating. By "single staged
