<ABSTRACT>
A tablet which dissolves rapidly in the oral cavity and can be prepared in a simple manner without resort to any special 
preparation technique. The tablet comprises a sugar alcohol or the like as the principal ingredient and is prepared by the wet 

granulation method wherein a kneaded mixture of the sugar alcohol or the like with a drug is compression molded before drying. 
This tablet can be prepared merely by modifying partly the conventional tableting method and has a sufficient physicochemical 

stability.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a drug-containing fast soluble
tablet that dissolves rapidly in the oral cavity.The fast soluble tablet usually dissolves in the oral cavity
within 15 seconds to 3 minutes, and is suitable for administration
to infants, the aged, severely affected patients and others
who have difficulty in taking tablets.Oral dosage forms of drugs include tablets, granules, powders and
liquids. Liquids, such as syrups, are suitable for administration
to the physically weakened aged and infants because they are
easily swallowable. However, they are not convenient because
they must be accurately weighed for each use. Another drawback
is that the tendency to deteriorate easily upon exposure to heat
or atmosphere degrades the drug's chemical and physical stability.Granules and powders are free of the above drawbacks, but they
are not easily swallowable, and taking the accurate dose is
difficult unless they are taken with water etc.Tablets are suitable for administration of a certain accurate
volumes and offers excellent chemical and physical stability for
the drug contained, but they have a drawback of difficult swallow
for infants, the aged, severely affected patients and others.
Overcoming the drawback of poor swallowability would make it
possible to provide an excellent preparation free of the above-described
drawbacks in other dosage forms. As a solution to the problem of poor swallowability in tablets, freeze-dried
preparations in a tablet form, based on a water-soluble polymer, have recently been
developed (e.g., Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication Nos. 44619/1978 and
86837/1991). They have overcome the drawback of poor swallowability in tablets by
causing the preparation to dissolve rapidly in the oral cavity. However, they require a
special preparation technology known as freeze-drying, resulting in drawbacks such as
difficulty in industrial mass-production, high production cost and poor physical
stability.In recent years, tablets have been produced by subjecting tablet components to
compressive shaping under high pressure in a dry state. This is because tablets are
essentially intended to be disintegrated in the gastrointestinal tract to cause drug
absorption and must be physically and chemically stable from completion of tableting
to reach to the gastrointestinal tract, so that the tablet components must be strongly
bound together by a compressive pressure. In early times, wet tablets were available,
which were molded and shaped into tablets while in a wet state, followed by

<CLAIMS>
A process for the production of pharmaceutical tablets which rapidly dissolve
in the oral cavity having a pharmaceutically active ingredient (drug) and an excipient,

comprising wet granulating the drug and an excipient which is readily soluble in
water, compressing the wet granulate into tablet form and drying the compressed

tablet.
A process according to claim 1, wherein the excipient is a sugar alcohol or a
sugar.
A process according to claim 2, wherein the sugar alcohol is xylitol.
A process according to claim 3, wherein the tablet is prepared at 480 - 2940 N
(50-300 Kg) of the compressive shaping pressure.
A process according to claim 1, wherein the excipient is a mixture of xylitol
and lactose.
A process according to claim 1, wherein the excipient is a mixture of xylitol
and mannitol.
A pharmaceutical tablet which rapidly dissolves in the oral cavity obtainable
by the process as defined in claim 1, having a pharmaceutically active ingredient

(drug), and the mixture of xylitol and at least one member selected from the group
consisting of lactose and mannitol.
