<ABSTRACT>
A dual chamber pump comprises a shaft (20) to each end 
of which is attached a driven member (30), a body member (45) 

being disposed over each driven member (30) to define 
therewith a pumping chamber (70), to which chambers (70) is 

alternately fed a supply of pressure. The driven members (30) 
each includes an expandable bellows (36) which reduces wear 

on the pump, while it is preferred that the body members (45) 
are secured to the pump by rotatable body rings (18) which 

enable ready disassembly of the pump by rotation of the body 
rings (18).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pump 
with the features of the preamble of Claims 1 and 2, and more particularly to 
a simple and compact design for a reciprocating, dual chamber, 
compressed air driven pump. The strength of the pump's design 
facilitates making the pump entirely of corrosion resistant 
materials. Dual chamber diaphragm pumps are known in the art. 
Pumps of this type are described in U.S. Patent No. 4,708,601 
to Bazan et al, U.S. Patent No. 4,817,503 to Yamada, and U.S. 
Patent No. 5,108,270 to Kozumplik, Jr. The pumps disclosed in 
these patents are pumps in which air pressure drives a pair of 
flexible diaphragms. Each diaphragm draws fluid through an 
inlet into a pumping chamber and forces the fluid out through 
an outlet as the diaphragm moves back and forth inside the 
pump. Such pumps have found widespread use pumping a diverse 
variety of fluids including water, chemicals, food products and 
other materials. Known diaphragm pumps often have complicated designs 
including small metal fittings and fasteners. These 
complicated designs hinder disassembly and reassembly of the 
pumps. This makes routine maintenance and overhaul somewhat 
difficult. It would be desirable, therefore, to provide an 
improved pump design that would require less frequent 
maintenance. It would be further desirable to provide a 
simpler pump design allowing for convenient disassembly and 
reassembly to make required maintenance easier to perform. Some dual chamber diaphragm pumps are adapted to pump 
corrosive fluids. These fluids would attack and corrode the 
metal parts commonly used in pumps designed for less demanding 
applications. In these pumps, some or all of the parts that  
 
normally come into contact with the pumped material (the wetted 
parts) are formed of or coated with chemically inert materials. 
United States Patent Numbers 4,817,503 and 5,108,270 (mentioned 
above), as well as U.S. Patent No. 4,867,653 to Mills et al, 
describe pumps having some parts formed of corrosion resistant 
materials. However, even those pumps whose wetted parts are 
formed of or coated with corrosion resistant materials almost 
invariably include some metal parts in other, exterior 
locations. In many cases metal parts are used as fasteners and 
fittings to hold the pump bodies and associated tubing 
together. This is presumably because metal parts are 
significantly stronger and more easily machined than are 
corrosion resistant parts, which are typically made of some 
type of soft (relative to metal)
