 DESCRIPTIONADJUSTABLE BOOK RESTTechnical Field This invention relates to adjustable and readily portable book rests. Background of the InventionThere are many occasions when a readily adjustable and portable book rest is useful, for example when an adult or child is reading in bed at home or in hospital. On such occasions, it is important that the book rest not only be readily portable but also readily adjustable in such a manner that the angle of the book relative to a reader's eyes be correctly set to suit a particular reader's preference. It is also an advantage if the book rest can be used for other purposes than reading a book, for example for supporting a writing pad or drawing paper. It is a further advantage if the book rest can be folded when not in use for convenience when carried from one place to another or when storing for future use. Many different designs have been proposed over the years but, so far as applicant is aware, none have met al] the criteria mentioned above. It is therefore an object of the invention to provide an improved book rest which can meet such criteria. Disclosure of the InventionAccording to the invention, an adjustable and readily portable book rest comprises a support member having a transversely extending fold line providing an upper support member portion above the fold line and a lower support member portion below the fold line, a rigid spine secured to the upper support member portion and projecting therefrom below the fold line, and a flexible adjustment strap extending from the lower support member portion and securable to the spine at different positions therealong to enable the book rest to be erected for use with the upper support member portion at a desired angle by angulating the lower support member portion about the fold line rearwardly relative to the upper support member portion and appropriately securing the adjustment strap to the spine to cause the desired angle to be maintained by the book rest when 

set down on a supporting surface with a lower edge of the lower support member portion and a lower end of the spine being supported thereby.The adjustment strap and the spine may each carry a strip of Velcro material to enable the adjustment strap to be secured to the spine at different locations to enable the upper support member portion to be set at different angles.The book rest may also include a pair of clips secured to an upper -edge portion of the upper support member portion on opposite sides of the spine to enable reading or writing

CLAIMS
1. A readily adjustable and portable book rest comprising a support member having a transversely extending fold line providing an upper support member portion above the fold line and a lower support member portion below the fold line, a rigid spine secured to the upper support member portion and projecting therefrom below the fold line, and a flexible adjustment strap extending from the lower support member portion and securable to the spine at different positions there-along to enable the book rest to be erected for use with the upper support member portion at a .desired angle by angulating the lower support member portion about the fold line rearwardly relative to the upper support member portion and appropriately securing the adjustment strap to the spine to cause the desired angle to be maintained by the book rest when set down on a supporting surface with a lower edge of the lower support member portion and a lower end of the spine being supported thereby.
2. A book rest according to claim 1 wherein the adjustment strap and the spine each carry a strip of Velcro material to enable the adjustment strap to be secured to the spine at different locations to enable the upper support member portion to be set at different angles.
3. A book rest according to claim 1 also including a pair of clips secured to an upper edge portion of the upper support member portion on opposite sides of the spine to enable reading or writing material to be secured by the clips to the upper support member portion.
4. A book rest according to claim 1 wherein the adjustment strap and the spine each carry a strip of Velcro material to enable the adjustment strip to be secured to the spine at different locations to enable the upper support member portion to be set at different angles, the book rest also including a pair of clips secured to an upper edge portion of the upper 


support member portion on opposite sides of the spine to enable reading or writing material to be secured by the clips to the upper support member portion.
5. A book rest according to any one of claims 1 to 4 wherein the support member has a pair of further fold lines extending from an upper edge to a lower edge thereof on opposite sides of and adjacent to the spine to enable the book rest to be folded when -not in use by folding the support member about the further fold lines.
