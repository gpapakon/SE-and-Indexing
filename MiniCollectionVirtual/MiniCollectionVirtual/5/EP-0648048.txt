<ABSTRACT>
A reflecting image projection screen (1) is described, as well as an image 
projection system (17) in which such a projection screen (1) is used. Viewed from the 

front side (3) of the projection screen (1), the image projection screen comprises, in this 
order, a linear polarizer (9), a λ/4 plate (11), a reflecting polarizer (13) in the form of a 

cholesteric filter and a reflecting layer (15) which is also active as a depolarizing 
diffuser layer. By combining a cholesteric filter (13) with a depolarizing reflecting layer 

(15), an image projection screen is obtained which is highly reflective to the direction of 
polarization supplied by the image projector (19) and substantially absorbs the other 

direction of polarization.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a reflecting image projection screen comprising a
polarizer and a reflecting layer for reflecting radiation which is incident on the
reflecting layer via the polarizer.The invention also relates to an image projection system comprising such
a reflecting image projection screen.An image projection system having a reflecting image projection screen of
the type described in the opening paragraph is known from
EP-A-295913. The image projection screen described in this Application is a
reflecting image projection screen and may be implemented, for example as a metal
screen. Since not only radiation supplied by the image projector, hereinafter referred to
as signal light, but also ambient light is incident on the image projection screen and is
reflected by this screen into the audience room, the ambience of this screen is to be
considerably darkened in order that an image which is rich in contrast can be observed.
For this reason the side of the image projection screen facing the viewer is provided
with a polarizer which absorbs substantially 50% of the ambient light. In this manner
the reduction of contrast of the image due to ambient light is reduced. The illumination
system of the image projector comprises a radiation source whose radiation is split into
p and s-polarized radiation by a polarization-sensitive beam splitter. One of the two
linearly polarized beams is incident on a liquid crystal element in which the direction of
polarization of the beam is modulated in conformity with the image generated by the
element. Subsequently, the modulated radiation is projected in the form of an image on
the image projection screen via a projection lens. Since the projected signal light is
linearly polarized in the direction of polarization of the screen polarizer, this light is
substantially completely passed to the audience room by the polarizer on the screen after
reflection on the reflecting layer.In the system described radiation incident on the image projection screen
is reflected at an angle whose size is substantially equal, but opposite to the angle of 
incidence. This is the case, inter alia, in image projection systems in which the image
projector is secured, for example to the ceiling and in which the screen is a specularly
reflecting screen, for example a metal screen. The radiation is then reflected towards
the audience room which is at a lower level than the projection screen.Due to the required mutual positioning of the projector, the projection
screen and the viewer(s), a
