<ABSTRACT>
The preparation of a zinc mercaptoacid ester by the reaction 
of zinc oxide with the mercaptoacid ester in a wax matrix provides 

an improved heat stabilizer for halogen-containing polymer 
compositions. The process obviates the necessity of isolating and 

transporting the normally very viscous zinc mercaptoacid esters. 
The zinc mercaptoacid ester/wax matrix is also an expedient medium 

for the preparation and utilization of calcium stearate as a 
lubricant in the heat stabilizer composition and the stabilized 

polymer composition containing it. A paraffin wax is the preferred 
matrix for the preparation and use of the heat stabilizer and 

lubricant.

<DESCRIPTION>
Halogen containing polymers, especially those containing
chlorine, are used widely and have great commercial significance.
Polyvinyl chloride (PVC), in particular, is used in packaging,
siding, pipe, and many extruded shapes. Such large scale and
diverse use of the halogen-containing polymers depends upon the
incorporation therein of good heat and light stabilizers. PVC, for
example, is known to have a tendency to degrade upon prolonged
exposure to heat and light during processing and use. Darkening or
other color change and the loss of tensile, flexural, and impact
strengths are the results of such degradation. Unless good low-cost
stabilizers are available for addition to the polymer
composition, the service life of articles made from the composition
will be limited, and its use severely restricted, as will be the
conditions for making it.One particularly troublesome form of degradation occurs when
the polymer composition is processed into articles by methods
employing heat to melt or soften the polymer. A color change can
occur during the first few minutes at high temperatures (e.g., from
175 to 200Â°C) and it is commonly referred to as early
color or early discoloration. The avoidance of such early color is
notably important in the manufacture of plastic pipe and siding.
It is, of course, also important to prevent or reduce discoloration
and deterioration of the polymer during extended exposure to high
temperatures, which can lead to sudden and catastrophic degradation
into a pitch-like abrasive material and cause the formation of
corrosive materials such as HCl inside the fabricating equipment.
The inner, highly polished surfaces of the equipment can thus be
rendered essentially useless. Attempts have been made to replace organo-tin
stabilizers at least in part with other organo-metal
compounds such as zinc mercaptoesters. The complete
replacement of organo-tin compounds by zinc mercaptoesters
such as [C8H17OC(=0)CH2S]2 Zn in combination with alkali metal
salts of organic acids is taught in JP-A-75 89451. In
US-A-4,515,916, Molt teaches that a composition comprising a
zinc mercaptoester, a basic inorganic alkali metal or
alkaline earth metal compound, and, optionally, a substituted
dihydropyridine is useful as a stabilizer for
halogen-containing polymers.The present invention consists in a method for the
preparation of a zinc mercaptoester comprising heating a
mixture of zinc oxide, a mercaptoester and hydrocarbon wax
and removing water as it forms.The method of this invention eliminates the need
