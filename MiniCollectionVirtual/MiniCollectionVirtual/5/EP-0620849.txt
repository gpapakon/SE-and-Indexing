<ABSTRACT>
The construction of transgenic animal models for testing potential treatments for Alzheimer's disease are described. The models are characterized by a greater similarity to the conditions existing in naturally occurring Alzheimer's disease, based on expression of all three forms of the  beta -amyloid precursor protein (APP), APP695, APP751, and APP770, as well as various point mutations based on naturally occurring mutations, such as the London and Indiana familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) mutations at amino acid 717, and predicted mutations in the APP gene. The APP gene constructs are prepared using the naturally occurring promoter, as well as inducible promoters such as the mouse metallothionine promoter, which can be regulated by addition of heavy metals such as zinc to the animal's water or diet, and promoters such as the rat neuron specific enolase promoter, human  beta  actin gene promoter, human platelet derived growth factor B (PDGF-B) chain gene promoter, rat sodium channel gene promoter, mouse myelin basic protein gene promoter, human copper-zinc superoxide dismutase gene promoter, and mammalian POU-domain regulatory gene promoter. The constructs are introduced into animal embryos using standard techniques such as microinjection. Animal cells can be isolated from the transgenic animals or prepared using the same contructs with standard techniques such as lipofection or electroporation. The transgenic animals, or animal cells, are used to screen for compounds altering the pathological course of Alzheimer's disease as measured by their effect on the amount and histopathology of APP and  beta -amyloid peptide in the animals, as well as by behavioral alterations.

<DESCRIPTION>
Transgenic technology is described for the
production of animals that exhibit symptoms of human
Alzheimer's disease through the expression of the
Alzheimer's precursor protein or a modified version
thereof.Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a degenerative
disorder of the brain first described by Alios
Alzheimer in 1907 after examining one of his patients
who suffered drastic reduction in cognitive abilities
and had generalized dementia ("The early story of
Alzheimer's Disease", edited by Bick K., Amaducci L.,
and Pepeu G. (Raven Press, New York 1987). It is the
leading cause of dementia in elderly persons. AD
patients have increased problems with memory loss and
intellectual functions which progress to the point
where they cannot function as normal individuals.
With the loss of intellectual skills the patients
exhibit personality changes, socially inappropriate
actions and schizophrenia ("A guide to the
understanding of Alzheimer's Disease and related
disorders", edited by Jorm AF.; (New York University
Press, New York 1987). AD is devastating for both
victims and their families, for there is no effective
palliative or preventive treatment for the inevitable
neurodegeneration. The most common problems in the
Alzheimer's patient are inability to dress unaided,
restlessness by day, urinary incontinence and sleep
disturbances. The family members report
embarrassment, anxiety, depression, and a decreased
social life.The impact of AD on society and on the national
economy is enormous. It is expected that the demented
elderly population in the United States will increase
by 41% by the year 2000. It is expensive for the
health care systems that must provide institutional
and ancillary care for the patients at an estimated 
annual cost of $40 billion (Jorm, 1987; Fisher, LM:
New York Times, August 23, 1989 D1 "Alzheimer's
Disease", edited by Reisberg, B.; (The Free Press, New
York & London 1983). These factors imply preventive
action must be taken to decrease AD incidence by
allocating resources into AD research.At a macroscopic level, the brains of AD patients
are usually smaller, sometimes weighing less than
1,000 grams. At a microscopic level, the
histopathological symptoms of AD include
neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), neuritic plaques, and
degeneration of neurons. AD patients exhibit
degeneration of nerve cells in the frontal and
temporal cortex of the cerebral cortex, pyramidal
neurons of hippocampus, neurons in the medial, medial
central, and cortical nuclei of the amygdala,
noradrenergic neurons in the locus
