<ABSTRACT>
Various levitation devices are disclosed in which an array of permanent magnets (12) is levitated by magnetic interaction with a diamagnetic material (16). Levitation is achieved without using a fixed permanent magnet or other device to supplement the magnetic field of the array. The cost and design constraints resulting from undesirable spring constants produced by such permanent magnets are thereby avoided.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the levitation of magnetic materials by magnetic fields, and more 
particularly to the suspension of such materials in a state of stable or indifferent equilibrium 
relative to gravitational attraction. The invention may be incorporated and used for measurement 
and control in a wide range of instruments such as accelerometers, flow meters, gravity meters, 
gyroscopes, magnetometers, micrometers, and tilt meters, as well as in nonmeasurement devices 
such as bearings and other apparatus. There are many applications where it would be desirable to levitate a magnet or a magnetic 
member. A levitated magnet can be acted on magnetically, and its position can be sensed 
magnetically. But it is very difficult to levitate magnets, and there are significant limitations to all 
the prior approaches. Magnetostatic or stationary electromagnetic fields will not levitate magnets 
or magnetic materials unless the field is specially modified to have a relative magnetic permeability 
that is less than one at one or more positions. Otherwise, the magnetic material to be suspended 
will either be expelled from the field or drawn into contact with a magnet providing the field. This 
phenomenon is referred to as instability. Magnetic fields with stable or indifferent equilibrium can 
be created by interaction between a permanent magnet and a material having a relative magnetic 
permeability less than one. The stabilizing magnetic force of such a field is inversely proportional 
to the relative magnetic permeability. Diamagnetic materials have relative magnetic permeabilities that are lower than one and can be used 
to provide stable levitation. But the permeabilities are only slightly lower than one and provide 
low lift force. Large permanent magnets have been used to levitate diamagnetic members. But 
that is very different from levitating a magnet. One prior reference suggests that the interaction 
between a magnet and a diamagnetic material could levitate a few microns of the magnetic material. 
That is not a sufficient volume for use in a practical device. Another reference uses a diamagnetic 
material to provide stability and a second fixed magnet located above a first magnet in order to  
 
provide sufficient lift force to levitate the first magnet. Some of the drawbacks of 
this design are that the second magnet creates substantial magnetic 
spring constants or forces that distort the motion and limit the stability of 
the first magnet. The lift magnet also increases size, weight, and

A method of levitating a magnetic member relative to the gravitational attraction of 
the earth comprising the steps of: 


arranging a plurality of magnets (14) to form a first member (12) comprised of said 
magnets having both a high magnetic strength and high magnetic gradient adjacent a 

predetermined portion of said first member, wherein said step of arranging comprises 

disposing said magnets in a consecutive sequence with each two consecutive magnets having 
opposite magnetic polarity; 
providing a second member (16) comprised of a diamagnetic material having a relative 
magnetic permeability less than one at ambient temperatures; and 
positioning said first and second members proximate each other with said predetermined 
portion to said first member (12) facing said second member (16), the materials of the first 

and second members being selected such that the magnetic interaction between said 
members is sufficient to levitate said first member relative to a full gravitational attraction 

of at least 1 g without requiring magnetic field supplement from another magnetic source. 
The method of claim 1 in which: 

said step of providing said second member (16) provides a diamagnetic member comprised 
of either graphite or bismuth; and 
said step of positioning said first (12) and said second member (16) members provides a 
magnetic interaction that levitates said first member relative to a full gravitational attraction 

of at least 1 g. 
The method of claim 1 in which: 

said step of arranging said magnets (14) comprises arranging a plurality of permanent 
magnets, each formed from a strongly magnetic material and each having a north magnetic 

pole and a south magnetic pole separated by a straight line section of magnetic material, 
into a consecutive sequence in which each two consecutive magnets define a closed loop 

magnetic flux path that intercepts both of said magnetic poles of said two consecutive 
magnets; and 
said step of positioning said first and second members comprises positioning said  
 

members such that a geometric extension of said straight line separation of said 
magnetic north and south poles for each of said magnets defines a direction that 

intercepts said second member. 
The method of claim 3 in which said step of arranging said magnets comprises 
arranging magnets having a first dimension parallel to said separation of said north 

and south magnetic poles and a second dimension perpendicular to said first 
dimension and a ratio of said first dimension to said dimension between about 0.3 and 

0.8. 
The method of claim 3 in which: 

said step of arranging magnets provides a plurality of disk shaped first members (58) 
that are substantially identical to each other and disposed at spaced intervals along a 

shaft (54); 
said step of providing said second member provides a plurality of disk shaped second 
members (60) comprised of said diamagnetic material that are disposed at spaced 

intervals from each other; and 
said step of positioning said first and second members comprises positioning said first 
and second disk shaped members such that they are interleaved and substantially 

parallel to each other. 
The method of claim 1 further including the step of moving said first member 
relative to said second member by magnetic interaction with said first member. 
The method of claim 1 further including the step of sensing the position of 
said first member relative to said second member.
