<ABSTRACT>
A plurality of different materials which are 
required for use in a process and which are to be kept 

separate up to a predetermined stage in the process are 
supplied with each different material being encapsulated 

within a plurality of discrete shells, the shells serving 
to keep the different materials separate from each other. 

The shells for the different materials are distinguishable 
from each other so as to permit subsequent sorting of the 

shells into batches of shells all containing the same 
material.

<DESCRIPTION>
THE PRESENT INVENTION relates generally to the field of
supplying photographic processing materials and more
particularly to the form in which several different
photographic processing materials may be supplied in a
single package for use in a process and to a method of
supplying those materials for use in the process.A unit for the processing of photographic materials
must be supplied with a developer material and a fixer
material. These materials usually consist of several
components which must be mixed together in the correct
proportions. These components are often supplied in the
form of concentrates which may be in either liquid or
powder form. The concentrates must be mixed with water in
order to dilute them to the required strength before they
are mixed together to produce the developer or fixer
material. Thus, whilst providing the component materials
as concentrates reduces the required volume of the
component, it does necessitate the provision of large
quantities of water which is heavy and awkward to handle.
It also necessitates the provision of large tanks for
storing the water.The supply of several different components which
need to be diluted and mixed together to form a developer
material or a fixer material also involves the use of large
amounts of packaging. In recent years there has been
increasing concern over the protection of the environment
and the earth's natural resources which has resulted in the
increased recycling of packaging. It is now not uncommon
for the suppliers of products to offer to remove and
recycle packaging within which their products are supplied,
thereby encouraging purchasers who are "environmentally
conscious" to invest in their products rather than in a
competitors' product where the competitor may not offer to
remove and recycle the waste packaging. Clearly in this 
situation the suppliers are most concerned to keep the
amount of packaging which has to be removed and recycled to
a minimum.The components for photographic developers and
fixers may be supplied either in the form of liquid
concentrates or powder concentrates. Each form has its own
advantages and disadvantages. Thus, powders are compact,
light and therefore relatively easy to transport, but can
create a dusty and hazardous environment when they are
removed from their containers. Liquids on the other hand
are less hazardous when used but, as mentioned above, are
heavy and bulky making them awkward to handle and
transport. It has also been proposed to freeze-dry the
concentrate components for

<CLAIMS>
A kit of photographic processing materials for use
in a process, the kit comprising a plurality of different

photographic processing materials in a single package,
which materials are to be kept separate up to a

predetermined stage in the process, each different material
being encapsulated within a plurality of discrete shells

which serve to keep the different materials separate from
each other, the shells for each different material being

distinguishable from each other so as to permit sorting of
the shells into batches of shells all containing the same

material.
A kit of materials according to Claim 1, wherein
the shells for each different material are of differing

sizes, differing shape or differing colour.
A kit of materials according to Claim 1 or Claim 2,
wherein the shells are substantially rigid.
A kid of materials according to any one of the
preceding Claims, wherein the shells are water-soluble and

are formed from a material comprising sugar.
A kit of materials according to any one of the
preceding Claims, wherein the plurality of different

materials in the package are in approximately the
proportions in which they are required when used in the

process.
A kit of photographic processing materials
according to any one of the preceding Claims, the materials

comprising the components of a photographic developer or
fixer. 
A method of supplying a plurality of different
photographic processing materials required for use in a

process where the materials are to be kept separate up to
a predetermined stage in the process, the method comprising

the steps of encapsulating each different material within
a plurality of discrete shells which serve to keep the

different materials separate from each other, the shells
for each different material being distinguishable from each

other and packing the plurality of different, encapsulated
materials into a single package and supplying the different

materials in said single package.
A method according to Claim 7, wherein the method
also comprises sorting the different materials from each

other after they have been supplied in a single package and
storing them separately.
A method of replenishing a stock of a plurality of
different materials used in a photographic processing unit,

the method comprising supplying the materials to the
processing unit in accordance with the method of Claim 7 or

Claim 8.
