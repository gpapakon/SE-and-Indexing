<ABSTRACT>
An igniter tube (24) for a gas-generating device 
(10) comprising an elongate cylinder, a primary igniter 

powder (26) within the cylinder, a closure at one end of 
the cylinder, and an auto ignition cup (14) disposed at the 

end of the cylinder opposite the closure has a resin-blocked 
screen (34, 36) as the closure between the igniter 

powder and the auto ignition cup. The screen retains the 
fine powder within the tube for an extended period of time 

but is capable of allowing a flame front from an auto-ignition 
device to pass into the igniter tube to ignite the 

primary igniter powder.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus for generating gas for 
inflating a vehicle occupant restraint in the event of a collision 
of the vehicle. More specifically, this invention relates to an 
inflator assembly which generates gas to expand an airbag in the 
vehicle at the instant of the collision. Still more specifically, 
this invention relates to such an assembly which comprises an 
igniter tube filled with a very fine igniter powder and an auto 
ignition cup in close engagement with the tube. Many forms of inflators for air bag restraint systems are 
known. One form utilizes a solid fuel composition for the 
generation of the inflating gas and includes an annular combustion 
chamber bounded by inner and outer casings as disclosed in U. S. 
Patent Nos. 4,296,084; 4,561,675; and 4,817,828; all of which are 
incorporated herein by reference. The casings are commonly made of 
aluminum because of its light weight. Situated in close proximity 
to the solid fuel, which is usually in granular form, is a primary 
ignition assembly which comprises an electrical squib, an igniter 
tube, powdered primary igniter material within the tube, and a 
metal foil seal at one or both ends of the tube. Upon the 
occurrence of a collision, the squib fires the primary igniter 
material whose combustion in turn initiates the burning of the 
solid, gas-generating fuel. Auto ignition of the primary igniter 
material may occur, however, in the event that the vehicle is 
exposed to very high temperatures (e.g., above 650°F) such as would 
occur when there is an electrical fire in the engine compartment. 
To overcome the problem arising from the degradation of the 
aluminum in the casings at such high temperatures and the potential 
injury to by-standers by fragments sent flying by a bursting of the  
 
weakened casings, an auto ignition cup filled with nitrocellulose 
or other material which undergoes spontaneous combustion at a much 
lower temperature (e.g., about 350°F) is aligned in close 
engagement with the igniter tube. The strength of the aluminum 
metal is substantially unaffected at such temperatures. The 
combustion of the primary igniter material is initiated by the hot 
gas rushing from the auto ignition cup and burning through the seal 
at the end of the tube facing the cup. The practice of installing air bags on the passenger side of 
vehicles is growing rapidly and may soon become standard procedure. 
In order to provide a very large surface area for fast ignition, 
the primary ignition system for the
