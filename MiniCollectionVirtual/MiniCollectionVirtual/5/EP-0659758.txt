<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a sterically rigid metallocene compound which, as ligands, contains at least two substituted or unsubstituted cyclopentadienyl groups which are bonded to one another via a mono- or polycyclic ring system, at least one cyclopentadienyl group being fused to the mono- or polycyclic ring system, and to a process for the preparation of a cycloolefin copolymer. The cycloolefin copolymers thus obtained have high tensile strengths and are suitable for the production of extruded parts and injection-moulded articles.
