<ABSTRACT>
A sigma-delta analog-to-digital converter (ADC) (80) 
includes first (81) and second (82) integrators, a quantizer (83) 

connected to an output of the second integrator (82), and a 
feedback circuit (84) connected to the output of the quantizer 

(83). In order to avoid the effects of delays through actual 
circuit elements, the feedback circuit (84) keeps the feedback 

signal to the first integrator (81) in a high-impedance state until 
the quantizer (83) resolves the output of the second integrator 

(82). Thus, the first integrator (81) avoids temporarily summing 
a possibly incorrect feedback signal. In addition, the feedback 

circuit (84) also keeps the first integrator (81) from integrating 
a sum of an input signal and the feedback signal until the 

feedback signal is driven to its correct state in response to the 
output of the quantizer (83). To accomplish these results, the 

feedback circuit (84) includes a compensation circuit (151) for 
continually determining when the quantizer (83) resolves.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to analog-to-digital 
converters (ADCs), and more particularly, to sigma-delta ADCs. There are two basic techniques for implementing analog-to-digital 
converters (ADCs), the open-loop technique and the 
feedback technique. An open-loop converter generates a digital 
code directly upon application of an input voltage, and is 
generally asynchronous in operation. A feedback converter 
generates a sequence of digital codes from an input signal, 
reconverts these digital codes to an analog signal, and uses the 
reconverted analog signal as a feedback signal. Sigma-delta ADCs use the feedback technique and have been 
known in the industry since the early 1960s. The sigma-delta 
technique is attractive because it achieves high resolution by 
precise timing instead of precisely matched on-chip components, 
such as resistors and capacitors used in open-loop converters. 
Thus, the sigma-delta technique is the technique of choice for 
many integrated circuit applications. A basic sigma-delta ADC receives an analog input signal, 
and subtracts a feedback signal from the analog input signal to 
provide an error signal. The error signal is processed through a 
lowpass filter, and then quantized to form a digital output signal. 
A feedback digital-to-analog converter (DAC) provides the 
feedback signal after converting the digital output signal to 
analog form. Aside from the feedback DAC, the basic sigma-delta 
ADC may be implemented with conventional analog components 
such as operational amplifiers, comparators, and switched-capacitor 
filters. The basic sigma-delta ADC usually provides 
high resolution because integrated circuit clocking speeds allow 
the analog input signal to be highly over sampled. The basic  
 
sigma-delta ADC also has high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) 
because the lowpass filter shapes quantization noise out-of-band, 
which can then be sufficiently attenuated by conventional 
filtering techniques. One source of error degrading performance of sigma-delta 
ADCs is the degree of settling achieved in the switched-capacitor 
integrators. The degree of settling limits the clock rate of the 
converter. An upper bounded clock rate limits the maximum over-sampling 
ratio, or limits the maximum conversion bandwidth. If 
the necessary clock rate for a given over-sampling ratio and 
conversion bandwidth have been met, better inherent system 
settling may be traded off for such things as reduced gain-bandwidth 
of operational amplifiers, making the overall system 
smaller
