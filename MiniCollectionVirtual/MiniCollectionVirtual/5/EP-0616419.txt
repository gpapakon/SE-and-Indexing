<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a programmable-frequency sinusoid generator, comprising a programmable-frequency rectangular-signal generator, a means of counting the periods of the rectangular signal, a decoding means for supplying successive discrete sinusoid values on the basis of successive states of the counting means, a low-pass filter receiving the successive discrete sinusoid values and supplying the sinusoid. According to the invention, the low-pass filter is a switched-capacitance filter, the switching of which is controlled by a signal whose frequency is proportional to the frequency of the rectangular signal, which results, via an appropriate choice of the values of the capitances of the filter, in the cutoff frequency of the filter always being close to the frequency of the sinusoid.

<CLAIMS>
A generator for producing at least one
programmable frequency sine wave signal, including:


at least one square-wave signal programmable
frequency generator (13);
at least one means (12, 22) for counting the
periods of said square-wave signal;
at least one decoding means (14, 15, 32) for providing
successive discrete sine wave values from successive

states of said at least one counting means;
a low-pass filter (20) receiving the successive
discrete sine wave values from said at least one

decoding means and providing said at least one sine
wave;

   characterized in that said low-pass filter (20) is
a switched-capacitor filter whose switching mode is

controlled by a signal (B8) having a frequency
proportional to the frequency of said square-wave

signal, whereby, by switably selecting the values of
the filter's capacitors, the cut-off frequency of the

filter is always in the vicinity of the frequency of
said at least one sine wave.
The sine wave generator of claim 1 wherein the
filter receives a constant input voltage (Vref) and

wherein the decoding means includes a switched
capacitor having a programmable value to set the filter

gain, said programmable capacitor being formed by a
plurality of capacitors (CS0-CS3), each of which is

switched on or off by a switch (k0-k3) controlled by a
decoder (14) decoding the state of the counting means. 
The sine wave generator of claim 2 wherein the
counting means includes a multi-bit counter (22),

receiving as an input said square-wave signal (B11),
the most significant bit (B15) serving to control the

inversion or non-inversion of the sign of the filter's
gain, and the remaining bits being provided to said

decoder.
The sine wave generator of claim 3 wherein the
programmable switched capacitor is contained in a

switch cell in which one of the terminals of the
programmable switched capacitor is connectable, through

a switch (kS) controlled by the most significant bit
(B15), to switches to put the
 cell in non-inversion
mode, or to switches to put the cell in inversion mode.
A generator for generating a plurality of
superposed sine waves having close frequencies which

are programmable according to claim 4, characterized in
that it includes a switched-capacitor filter that

provides the superposed sine waves and is controlled at
a frequency that is proportional to the highest of said

programmable frequencies, and in that it includes, for
each sine wave, a square-wave signal generator counting

means, decoding means and a switched capacitor that is
programmable by the decoding means.
