<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an optoelectronic measuring scale for determining and indicating the position of light incident on the measuring scale and emitted from a beam source. The measuring scale is a composite unit which includes a profiled body (19), a row of discrete photoelements (25) which are fixedly mounted on a circuit board (24) or like device in the body (19) and which are connected to a microprocessor (26) attached to the circuit board (24); in that mounted in the measuring scale is a diffusor (32) which functions to distribute the radiation intensity such that incident light in the measuring scale will be distributed over a plurality of mutually adjacent photoelements (25); and in that the microprocessor (26) functions to detect and compare the intensity of the light emitted by respective photoelements (25) and, subsequent to calculating the centre-of-gravity of the broadened intensity curve, produces output currents which cause the exact position of the light beam on the measuring scale to be indicated on a display (27) connected to the measuring scale.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to a measuring instrument, 
and more particularly relates to an optoelectronic 
measuring scale which is construced to et determine and to 
indicate the exact position at which a beam of light 
emitted from a radiation source, for instance a laser 
projector, impinges thereon through a window or an 
opening. When detecting optical radiation, it is normal to use 
light detecting components generally in the form of 
semiconductors. optoelectronic integrated circuits are 
used in the form of detector matrices equipped with so-called 
CCD-devices. Such devices (charge coupled devices) 
are normally very small (10-15Âµm) and despite the 
fact that each separate matrix may include a large 
number of elements, about 2,000 elements, the total 
geometric extension of such a matrix is relatively 
short. Matrices which comprise charge coupled devices 
cannot therefore be used for measuring scales of relatively 
long lengths. This would require the matrices to 
be disposed in mutually sequential rows, but since the 
matrices are not equipped with CCD-devices right out to 
their extremities, the detection gaps between the matrices 
would reduce the detecting ability of such-a linear 
measuring scale. Neither is it possible to use matrices that are equipped 
with other forms of integrated circuits, since these 
would render the construction of remaining electronics 
in the measuring scale far too complicated for the 
intended purpose. A system utilizing a photo detector array is described in US-A-4 898 464 that is also concerned with 
the measuring of wheel angles. Here an array of photosensitive elements is arranged doubled with a 
staggered relation between them preventing the incident light-beam from falling between detectors and 
thereby resulting in misreading. The reading of the sensors 
are then evaluated by a connected computer calculating the center of the beam from the signals from 
the different separate sensors. The object of the present invention is to provide an  
  
 
optoelectronic measuring scale of relatively short 
extension, about 0.5 metre. The invention is set out in claim 1. The use of a diffusor in the beam path of the measuring 
scale is justified because the light beam emitted, for 
instance, by a laser projector has a small beam divergence 
and a small degree of intensity distribution. The 
pitch or spacing of the photoelements mounted on a 
circuit board in the measuring scale is greater than the 
intensity distribution of the light beam. With a diffusor

An optoelectronic measuring scale which is constructed

light beam incident on the measuring scale and emitted from 
a laser projector, 

the measuring scale 
being a composite unit which includes a section-profiled 

body (19), a row of discrete photoelements (25) which 
are fixedly mounted on a circuit board (24) or like 

device in said body (19) and which are connected to a 
microprocessor (26) attached to the circuit board (24) 

which calculates the weighted average center location of the photoelements; 

characterized
 in that mounted in front of the photoelements is a diffusor 
(32) which functions to distribute the light beam intensity 

such that incident light on the measuring scale 
will be distributed over a plurality of mutually adjacent 

photoelements (25); and in that the microprocessor 
(26) functions to detect and compare the intensity of 

the light detected by respective photoelements (25) and, 
sub
sequent to calculating the centre-of-gravity of the 
broadened intensity curve, produces output currents 

which cause the exact position of the light beam on the 
measuring scale to be indicated on a display (27) connected 

to the measuring scale.

An optoelectronic measuring scale according to 
Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
 in that an 
elongated lens (31) is mounted in an opening (28) on the 

upper side of the measuring scale, such as to enlargen 
the detector surface of the measuring scale and therewith 

capture possible movements of the beam source.
