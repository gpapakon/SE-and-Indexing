<DESCRIPTION>
 A CARD PRINTER APPARATUS AND METHOD5 , FIELD OF THE INVENTIONI '* The present invention relates to a printer apparatus and method including novel features for manipulating movement of a workpiece relative to a printer apparatus10 which includes a print head, and a print head controller apparatus and method for controlling printing by the printer apparatus. More specifically, it relates to an apparatus for transporting a receptor material, such as a plastic credit card, on a belt system which enables15 multiple pass printing over the entire exposed face of the receptor material without encumbering the printing process, and includes a print head controller apparatus for interfacing between at least one microprocessor and at least one continuous tone print head.20BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION When printing a colored image onto a receptor material such as a plastic credit card, three primary colors are typically used to create the composite color25 image. This is typically accomplished in three separate printing passes using a print head to print each of the three primary colors successively from a ribbon onto the credit card. A printing pass is commonly accomplished by moving the credit card across a fixed print head. The30 credit card is typically moved either by the use of a set of rollers acting upon the surface of the card or by carrying the card along a carriage yoke. t There exist several known devices for transporting a workpiece such as a credit card. As above, the card may-■ 35 be urged forward through the use of various rubber roller sets, or less commonly, through the use of hardened pins. The roller sets may be used in conjunction with upper and lower guide rails to maintain card position stability. The carriage yoke is typically provided with leading and 

trailing fingers for retaining the card, and may be driven via a steel cable and roller set. Other known devices for transporting the card include a tabbed timing belt with a plastic finger for driving the card into and out of the device, and urethane belts situated along the front and back sides of the card which are also used in conjunction with roller sets.One problem encountered with some of these methods of transporting a card in association with a printing operation is the difficulty in being able to accurately line up the printing of each color on the card during each pass of the card before the print head so that the image has the desired clarity and resolution, particularly when printing tonal color images at the high rates
