<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a process 
cartridge mountable to an image forming apparatus, 

comprising a rotary member, a holding member for holding 
the rotary member, and a plurality of rolling members 

assembled between the rotary member and the holding 
member independently from the holding member.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for
assembling rolling members, a rotary member, a process
cartridge and an image forming apparatus. The image
forming apparatus may be, for example, an electrophotographic
copying machine, a facsimile machine, a laser
beam printer, an LED printer, a word processor and
the like. Further, the rotary member is rotated during
the image forming operation and may be, for example,
a photosensitive drum as an image bearing member, an
insulation drum, a developing sleeve as a developer
bearing member, a charge roller as a charge means and
the like.In an image forming apparatus such as a printer,
a latent image is formed on an image bearing member
by selectively exposing the uniformly charged image
bearing member, the latent image is visualized as a
toner image and the toner image is transferred onto
a recording medium, thereby recording the image. In
such an image forming apparatus, since the maintenance
of various elements can be performed only by expert
service men, the users felt inconvenience. To avoid 
such inconvenience, there has been proposed a process
cartridge wherein the image bearing member, charger,
developing device, cleaning device and the like are
integrally assembled as a unit which can be removably
mounted to an image forming apparatus by the user and
which can be exchanged by a new one when the toner
is used up or the service lives of the image bearing
member and the like are expired, thereby facilitating
the maintenance.Such a process cartridge is required to be
made small-sized in correspondence to the requirement
of the compactness of the image forming apparatuses.
To this end, sliding bearings have been used as
bearings for rotary members such as the image bearing
member (for example, a photosensitive drum) and a
developer bearing member (for example, a developing
sleeve). However, when the process cartridge is mounted
to the image forming apparatus and then is driven,
the great torque is applied to the rotary members such
as the image bearing member and the developer bearing
member. Thus, when such rotary members are supported
by the sliding bearings, since the sliding resistance
of the rotary member being rotated is great, the great
load is generated. Accordingly, in order to drive
such rotary member, a large motor capable of generating
the great torque is required, thereby making the image
forming apparatus more expensive. Document D1 (EP-A-0 419 122) discloses an image forming
apparatus and a process cartridge (1) having an
