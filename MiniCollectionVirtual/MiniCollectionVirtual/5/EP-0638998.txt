<ABSTRACT>
A fast-acting automatic gain control arrangement comprises a gain-controlled 
amplifier stage (35), a detector stage (34) and a time delay means (33). The amplifier 

stage and detector stage are both fed in parallel from an input signal and the output of 
the detector stage is used to adjust the gain of the amplifier stage. The time delay 

means is included in series with and upstream of the amplifier stage. Means may be 
included in the control circuit to modify (e.g linearise) the transfer function of the gain-control 

function, and this may include provisions for inputting an external modifying 
signal. The detector is preferably a successive logarithmic amplifier to ensure that the 

automatic gain control arrangement can handle a wide input dynamic range.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a fast-acting automatic gain control arrangement, in 
particular a fast-acting automatic gain control arrangement for use in electronic and 
communications systems in which there is a requirement to amplify signals of a wide 
dynamic range. Amplifier systems used in fields such as radiocommunications, radar, 
instrumentation, electronic control systems, broadcasting, etc, often need to be able to 
handle input signals of wide dynamic range, while outputting signals at a substantially 
constant level. In computer and other communication systems where a CSMA (Carrier 
Sense Multiple Access) protocol system is used, it is important that a receiver be able 
to receive a strong or a weak signal without overloading and be able rapidly to adjust 
to level variations in order to minimise the effective deadtime of a network. 
Techniques for doing this go under the general name of Automatic Gain Control (AGC) 
and are already well established in the art. One of the most commonly used forms of 
AGC is the arrangement shown in Figure 1. In Figure 1, an AGC stage 10 is based around a gain-controlled amplifier 12. 
The gain-controlled amplifier 12 has two inputs: a signal input 13 and a gain-control 
input 14. The gain-control input 14 is arranged to modify the gain of the amplifier 12 
in accordance with the value of a signal appearing on the gain-control input 14. The 
output of the amplifier 12 is taken along a line 15 to form, firstly, the output 16 of the 
AGC stage and, secondly, a feedback loop 17 consisting of a rectifier (detector) 18 and 
a low-pass filter 19. The detected and filtered output signal is passed along a line 20 
to the gain-control input 14 of the amplifier 12.  The operation of the AGC stage is as follows. It is first assumed that the signal 
on the input 13 is initially zero, or of very low amplitude (see Figure 2). At a time t‚ÇÅ, 
the input signal rises sharply to a peak-to-peak value of A volts (see line (a) of Figure 
2), which would result in an output signal on line 16 having an amplitude higher than 
desired. The AGC system acts to reduce the output signal level by feeding back a 
detected version of the output signal to the amplifier 12, using this fed-back signal to 
reduce the gain of the amplifier 12. Thus the output of the amplifier 12 takes the peak-to-peak 
value B, as shown in line (b) of Figure 2. In order for the AGC system to 
work properly and to avoid signal distortion in the amplifier 12, the filter 19 is 
arranged to have a low enough cut-off point,
