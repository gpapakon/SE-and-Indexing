<ABSTRACT>
Packaging material for self-supporting packaging container walls can 
be given the desired flexural rigidity by being laminated to an inherently 

rigid material such as cardboard. Rigidity can also be achieved if two 
material layers are fixed at a given spacing from one another. According to 

the invention, this can be attained in that two material layers (1, 2) define an 
interjacent chamber (4) which is filled with gas under pressure. The material 

is produced by the material layers (1, 2) being sealed to one another over a 
portion of their surface such that a chamber (4) is formed which is filled with, 

for example, air under pressure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a packaging material comprising flexible
material layers that are interconnected with one another in a pattern of linear
sealings distributed over the surface area of the material layers and dividing an
interjacent chamber defined by the material layers into a pattern of mutually
connected, elongated cells. The invention also relates to a method of producing a
packaging material and use of the packaging material.Consumer packages for, for example, liquid or pumpable foods are
often manufactured from web or sheet-shaped material. The material can
be a plastic film or a packaging laminate which includes layers of different
materials. At least one surface layer of the packaging material often consists
of thermoplastic which, on the one hand, ensures the liquid-tightness of the
material and, on the other hand, makes it possible to heat-seal the material
to itself to form a liquid-tight bond. A packaging material can normally be
given satisfactory tightness against both gas and liquid penetration with the
aid of thin (5 micrometres) layers of different plastic types, for example so-called
barrier plastics, such as ethyl vinyl alcohol (EVAL) or aluminium foil.
The sealing properties of the packaging laminate are ensured by the
laminate displaying, at least at those parts which are to be sealed to one
another, layers of thermoplastic material, for example polyethylene.
Essentially two methods can be employed in order to ensure that the
material possesses self-supporting properties, i.e. sufficient rigidity to be
usable in the manufacture of configurationally stable, eg. parallelepipedic,
packaging containers. First, the material can include a layer of inherently
flexurally rigid material, for example board or metal, and secondly, the
desired rigidity can be achieved if the layers of naturally flexible plastic
material included in the material are placed at such a distance from one
another by means of some spacer arrangement or device, that so-called
bulkhead effect is achieved. This can be realised by connecting the material
layers on either side of a relatively thick layer of, for instance, foamed plastic
material or some other lightweight and inexpensive material which, together
with the surface layers, forms a so-called sandwich construction. In a sandwich construction including foamed plastic material which is
clad on either side with a suitable, homogeneous plastic material such as
polystyrene, the weight of the material included will, granted, be relatively
light, but
