<ABSTRACT>
A stage switching unit for use in transformers has a number of fixed contacts (Kn) mounted on a frame. Auxiliary contacts (5) are mounted on a slide element (3) that is subjected to the force applied by a spring (4) when a leadscrew (2) is rotated by a geared drive (1). The movable contact is mounted on a coupled mass (7) that is subjected to a separate spring force. The changeover between contacts occurs with a snap action.

Tap selector switch for tapped transformers, wherein fixed tap 
contacts are arranged along a linear path and switchable to by a 

displaceable switching mechanism which consists of a continuously 
drivable tensioning carriage and a drive part which is tensionable 

through this by means of an energy storage device and which after 
release rapidly follows the tensioning carriage, characterised 

thereby, that an additional spring (11) is arranged between the 
tensioning carriage (3) and the drive output part (7) in such a 

manner that the additional spring (11) is tensioned during a downward 
movement of the drive output part (7) and relieved during an upward 

movement of the drive output part (7). 
Tap selector switch according to claim 1, characterised thereby, 
that the additional spring (11) is arranged nearly vertical and 

fastened by its upper end at the tensioning carriage (3) and by its 
lower end at the drive output part (7). 
Tap selector switch according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised thereby, that the additional spring (11) is a tension 

spring.
