<ABSTRACT>
β-amyloid peptide (βAF) production in cell culture 
and in vivo is inhibited by administering aspartyl protease 

inhibitors, particularly inhibitors of proteases of cathepsin 
D. Useful aspartyl protease inhibitors can be selected in a 

two-step assay, where test compounds are first screened for 
aspartyl protease inhibition activity in vitro in noncellular 

assays. Those test compounds which are found to 
display protease inhibition activity are then tested in 

cellular assays for βAP production inhibition. Those test 
compounds which are capable of inhibiting intracellular β-amyloid 

production may be incorporated in pharmaceutical 
compositions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to methods 
and compositions for inhibiting β-amyloid peptide (βAP) 
production in cells. In particular, the present invention 
relates to the screening and identification of cellular 
protease inhibitors, specifically aspartyl protease 
inhibitors, which are capable of inhibiting the intracellular 
production of βAP, and the use of such cellular protease 
inhibitors in methods for inhibiting βAP production. Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a degenerative brain 
disorder characterized clinically by progressive loss of 
memory, cognition, reasoning, judgment and emotional 
stability that gradually leads to profound mental 
deterioration and ultimately death. AD is a common cause of 
progressive mental failure (dementia) in aged humans and is 
believed to represent the fourth most common medical cause of 
death in the United States. AD has been observed in races 
and ethnic groups worldwide and presents a major present and 
future public health problem. The disease is currently 
estimated to affect about two to three million individuals in 
the United States alone. To date, AD has proven to be 
incurable. The brains of individuals with AD exhibit neuronal 
degeneration and characteristic lesions variously referred to 
as amyloid plaques, vascular amyloid angiopathy, and 
neurofibrillary tangles. Large numbers of these lesions, 
particularly amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, are 
generally found in several areas of the human brain important 
for memory and cognitive function in patients with AD. 
Smaller numbers of these lesions in a more restricted 
anatomical distribution are found in the brains of most aged 
humans who do not have clinical AD. Amyloid plaques and 
vascular amyloid angiopathy also characterize the brains of 
individuals with Trisomy 21 (Down's Syndrome) and Hereditary  
 
Cerebral Hemorrhage with Amyloidosis of the Dutch-Type 
(HCHWA-D). At present, a definitive diagnosis of AD usually 
requires observing the aforementioned lesions in the brain 
tissue of patients who have died with the disease or, rarely, 
in small biopsied samples of brain tissue taken during an 
invasive neurosurgical procedure. The principal protein constituent of the amyloid 
plaques and vascular amyloid angiopathy characteristic of AD 
and the other disorders mentioned above is an approximately 
4.2 kilodalton (kD) protein of about 39-43 amino acids 
designated the β-amyloid peptide (βAP). βAP is an 
approximately 39-43 amino acid fragment of a large membrane-spanning 
g
