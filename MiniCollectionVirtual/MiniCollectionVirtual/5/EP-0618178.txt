<ABSTRACT>
A thermally tempered glass ply (1) for use as a component of 
a high strength glazing is strengthened by etching to remove 

surface glass to a depth of at least 100 microns, and the etched 
surface (2, 3, 4, 5) is protected by a polymeric surface layer 

(6). The strengthened glass ply is useful as a component of high 
strength glazings including aircraft windshields.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of strengthening glass by 
acid etching and to glass components so strengthened and laminated 
glazings containing them. It has long been known that glass may be strengthened by 
etching the surface of the glass to remove the surface layer and 
any defects therein which may act as a site for crack propagation 
leading to failure of the glass. For example, it is proposed in 
Swiss patent specification 367 942 dated 1958 and US patent 3 711 
263 dated 1969, to enhance the strength of glass by etching the 
surface to up to a depth of 80 or 20 microns respectively to 
remove surface defects and thereby strengthen the glass; the 
patent specifications suggest applying silica or other inorganic 
layer over the etched surface as a protective or hard layer. 
According to the Swiss patent specification, optimal strengthening 
may be achieved by thermal treatment of the glass directly after 
etching and before provision of a protective layer. According to 
the US patent, the glass treated is chemically toughened before 
etching. GB patent specification 1 359 165 dated 1974 relates to 
laminated glass for use in buildings and vehicles; it teaches 
subjecting a face of a glass pane to a rectifying treatment which 
reduces the impairment of that face by faults liable to cause  
 
stress concentrations when tensioning forces are applied to the 
glass pane, and using that pane in a laminate with the face which 
has been subject to the rectifying treatment located internally of 
the laminate. The rectifying treatments described include fire 
polishing and chemical dissolution (etching) to remove, for 
example, a glass depth of 60 microns; the face of the glass which 
is subjected to the rectifying treatment may, before or after that 
treatment, be compressively stressed e.g. by chemical or thermal 
tempering (toughening), and advantageously the external layers of 
both sides of the pane may be subjected to the rectifying 
treatment and compressively stressed substantially symmetrically. 
The laminates of the invention are said to be particularly 
suitable for use as motor vehicle windscreens, and it is proposed 
to use such a laminate as a vehicle windscreen comprising two 
panes of glass, one pane having a face that has been subject to a 
rectifying treatment located internally of the laminate as the 
inner pane of the windscreen. This arrangement provides a 
combination of properties which are important for avoiding 
concussive injury to a person who may make impact with the vehicle
