<ABSTRACT>
A digital portable telephone apparatus with a 
holding function normally has a VOX function and 

previously notifies, when absence of sound is detected 
in a sound presence condition, transmission power off 

of the talking channel by way of a postamble signal. 
The postamble signal is sent out periodically during a 

sound absence period and includes mobile station 
background noise generation information. Holding tone 

data which are the same data in successive sound 
sampling times are incorporated into the background 

noise generation information, and a resulted signal is 
transmitted. Accordingly, the transmission time of 

holding tone may be intermittent, and the transmission 
power can be saved.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a mobile telephone
system, and more particularly to a digital portable
telephone apparatus with a holding function and a VOX
function and a method for transmitting a holding tone
of the apparatus.A conventional portable telephone apparatus with a holding function is for example described in EP-A-0 265 944.Fig. 1 is a block diagram showing the construction
of a conventional example of a digital portable
telephone apparatus which realizes a holding condition
of speech.Key inputting section 1 is used for a speaker to
depress operation keys to input a destination number or
various function inputs. Microphone 3 converts the
inputted sound into sound signal Sv, and ascending
sound signal processing section 4 converts sound signal
Sv into sound data TX. Transmission section 6
generates transmission signal STX from inputted sound
data TX, and antenna 7 radiates transmission signal
STX. Meanwhile, reception section 10 converts 
reception signal RTX inputted thereto by way of antenna
7 into sound data RX, and descending sound signal
processing section 8 converts sound data RX into sound
signal Sv. Loudspeaker 9 converts inputted sound
signal Sv into sound and outputs the sound. Holding
tone generation section 11 generates holding tone data
Sk upon holding, and change-over switch 12 changes
ascending and descending sound signals Sv for holding
tone data Sk and vice versa. Control section 2
controls the components described above.Next, operation of the conventional example of
Fig. 1 is described. Upon ordinary conversation, sound
signal Sv from microphone 3 is converted into sound
data TX by ascending sound signal processing section 4
and transmitted as transmission signal STX from antenna
7 by way of transmission section 6. Meanwhile,
reception signal RTX fetched by antenna 7 is sent to
and converted by reception section 10 into sound data
RX. Sound data RX are converted into sound signal Sv
by descending sound signal processing section 8 and
outputted by way of loudspeaker 9.On the other hand, in a holding condition, the
speaker makes change-over switch 12 to change over from
the output of microphone 3 to the output of holding
tone generation section 11. Consequently, holding tone
data Sk successively pass ascending sound signal 
processing section 4 and transmission section 6 and are
transmitted from antenna 7. Simultaneously, descending
sound signal Sv is changed over to the output of
holding tone generation section 11 by change-over
switch 12, so that descending holding tone is
