<ABSTRACT>
A landing area, in particular for helicopters, has a base element (4) which consists of two superposed layers (4A, 4B) of a flexible material which are joined together at their edges (5), in particular by welding. Attached to the outside of the upper layer (4A) are electroluminescent light sources (2) which are covered by a covering layer (7), fastened to the base element (4), of a transparent material. Located between the two layers (4A, 4B) are supply lines (9) for the electroluminescent light sources (2), said supply lines being arranged within a protective sleeve (8) fixed to the inside of the layer (4A) (Fig. 3).

<CLAIMS>
Airfield or landing area (1), in particular for helicopters, with at 
least one basic element (4) on which electroluminescent light sources 

(2) connected via power lines (9) to a power source are attached, 
characterized in that the basic element (4) consists of superimposed 

layers (4A, 4B) of a flexible material mutually connected on their 
edges (5), that the electroluminescent light sources (2) are disposed 

on the outside of the upper layer (4A) and that the power lines (9) 
are disposed between the two layers (4A, 4B), preferably within a 

protective sleeve (8) provided on the inside of one of the two layers 
(4A, 48). 
Landing area according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
electroluminescent light sources (2) are covered by a protective layer 

(7) of transparent material placed on the basic element (4). 
Landing area according to claim 1, characterized in that a circuit 
element (12) with an interface device for controlling the various 

illuminating functions as well as optionally a memory for programming 
the desired illuminating functions is interposed in the power lines 

(9). 
Landing area according to claim 1, characterized in that an 
inverter (10) for controlling the frequency and voltage of the power 

supplied by a battery (11) is interposed in the power lines (9). 
Landing area according to claim 3, characterized in that the 
circuit element (12) is coupled with a radio receiver (13) effecting 

the control of the various illuminating functions via radio signals. 
Landing area according to claim 1, characterized in that a position 
finder is provided as landing aid. 
Landing area according to any one of the claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that a battery (11) constituting the power source is 

attachable to a battery charging device (14).
