<ABSTRACT>
A system and method for controlling the bypass clutch 
of an automatic transmission includes an electronic 

microprocessor (50), an electronic memory (62) accessible to 
the microprocessor (50), a torque converter bypass friction 

clutch (82), and control algorithms that produce output 
signals to control the state of solenoid-operated valve (70, 

72, 74, 76, 78). The vehicle speed at which the bypass 
clutch engages and disengages, according to a reference 

schedule, is compensated for loss of engine torque at 
conditions that differ from the conditions at which the 

reference schedule is defined. Vehicle speed is compensated 
for torque variation with reference to the ratio of current 

calculated engine torque divided by current engine output 
torque.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to control of a torque
converter bypass clutch in an automatic transmission. More
particularly, the invention pertains to altering where
torque converter bypass clutch engagements and releases are
to occur according to a reference schedule, on the basis of
variations in engine output torque.Conventionally, the electronic control system for an
automatic transmission is provided with a gear shift
schedule that defines conditions of current engine throttle
position and vehicle speed at which each gear ratio change
is to occur. Generally, data located in look-up tables
stored in electronic memory, relating vehicle speed and
engine throttle position for each of the gear ratio changes,
are used to produce a signal representing the desired gear
ratio. When the desired gear ratio is different from the
current gear ratio, a command signal is produced by the
control to cause a change in state of solenoid-operated
shift valves. This changes the state of the planetary gear
units and causes the gear ratio to change.A reference schedule of gear shift boundaries is
continually referenced during execution of control
algorithms and used to produce an upshift signal and a
downshift signal when a boundary of the gear shift schedule
is crossed. Gear shifts are made by continually probing
computing memory with current values of throttle position
and vehicle speed, and determining, on the basis of the
stored shift schedules, whether an upshift or downshift is
required. Upshift points are determined also on the basis
of maximum engine speed when a wide-open throttle condition
is detected.U.S. Patent 4,943,921 describes an electronic control
for scheduling gear shifts in an automatic transmission on
the basis of variations in ambient barometric pressure.
Various functions relating vehicle speed and throttle 
position determine the occurrence of each upshift and downshift
by probing computer memory, in which the gear shift functions
reside, with current values of the throttle position and
vehicle speed. A reference gear shift schedule is corrected for
the difference between the operating barometric pressure and
a reference barometric pressure, at which the gear shift
schedules are calibrated, to automatically compensate for the
effect of barometric pressure variations on the gear shift
schedule.The present invention relates to a method and a system for
controlling operation of a torque converter bypass clutch for
use in a multiple-gear ratio automatic transmission of a motor
vehicle having an engine
