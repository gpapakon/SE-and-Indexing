<ABSTRACT>
There is provided a structure of a shim to be inserted in a clearance 
provided between a cam and a tappet in a moving valve mechanism of an 

internal combustion engine, wherein a volmeric density of the shim 
body is changed such that it is maximized at an upper surface of the 

shim, at which the shim is in contact with the cam when a compression 
load or shock from the cam is applied to the shim, and the density is 

gradually decreased from the maximized portion to a lower or 
peripheral portions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a new structure of a valve clearance 
adjusting shim to be provided and to be inserted directly between a 
valve tappet and a cam for an overhead valve engine with a camshaft 
placed in an internal combustion engine. Particularly, it relates to 
the shim structure with improved strength profile with specific 
density distribution, which allows to have optionally higher strength 
at the portion at which the shim be in contact with a cam surface. A typical moving valve in use for an internal combustion engine may 
comprises an engine valve, a valve spring to press the valve to a 
closed position, a valve spring retainer for transmitting a pressure 
of the spring to the valve, a valve holder to hold the valve spring 
on a valve shaft, a tappet reciprocating to open and close the valve, 
by a rotation of a cam shaft, and a rotating cam shaft. 
There are various ways of causing the intake and exhaust valves to 
open and close. For example, in four-stroke cycle engine, when the 
crankshaft turns, the camshaft must turn on which a number of cams are 
provided. These cams are simply raised sections or collars, with high 
spots on them. When the camshaft rotates, the high spots (called 
lobes) move around and push away anything they are in contact with. 
Riding on each cam is a valve tappet. As the lobe moves down on the 
valve tappet, the valve tappet goes down. This downward movement 
caused the valve above it to go down also. Thus, the valve goes down 
off its seat in the engine cylinder so that the valve opens. When the 
lobes on the cam moves on around out of the way, the pressure of the 
spring under the valve forces the valve to move up and reseat. At  
 
the same time, the valve tappet is also forced upward so that it 
remains in contact with the cam. There is provided a clearance between a cam and a tappet, for 
adjustment against dimensional change due to heat expansion and/or 
friction. A plate or disc is inserted in this clearance so as to 
adjust the valve movement. This plate is called, or referred to as a 
clearance adjustment shim or only a shim. Further, there may be 
provided a metal tip made of the same metal as that of the tappet, or 
the different metal at the end position with which the engine valve is 
in contact. In this case, this tip is called as "intershim", and then, 
the shim to be inserted in the clearance called as "outershim", so as 
to discriminate one from the other. The product of the present 
invention comprises an outershim. Such a structure
