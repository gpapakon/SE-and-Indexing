<ABSTRACT>
The application relates to a calorimetric measurement device having a decomposition vessel (2) whose internal space is designed as a reaction chamber and can be closed off in a leaktight manner, the decomposition vessel being arranged interchangeably in a casing (6) and having at least one temperature sensor (5) for measuring the temperature reached in the decomposition vessel. The measurement device according to the invention is characterised in that the casing has a measurement vessel which accommodates the decomposition vessel and has its wall made at least zonally of a thermally conducting material, in that the inner walls of this measurement vessel are separated from the outer walls of the decomposition vessel with formation of an intermediate space, in which a gaseous intermediate medium is provided, and in that the measurement device has at least a second temperature sensor (12, 20) for measuring the temperature change produced in the thermally conductive wall region of the measurement vessel. With the aid of the measurement device according to the invention, it is possible to make calorimetric measurements of thermal value with high precision and short measurement time, it also being possible to carry out comparatively many measurements in a day.

A bomb calorimeter with an decomposition vessel (2), 
the interior of which takes the form of a reaction 

chamber and is sealable, the decomposition vessel (2) 
being removably arranged in a jacket (6) and having at 

least one temperature sensor (5) for measuring the 
temperature reached in the decomposition vessel, 

wherein the jacket (6) surrounding the decomposition 
vessel (2) takes the form of a heat sink (6) and at 

least areas thereof consist of material of good thermal 
conductivity and high heat capacity, 
characterized in 
that
 the inside walls (9) and the outside walls (15) of 
the heat sink (6) are in spaced relationship to the 

outside walls (10) of the decomposition vessel (2) and 
inside walls of an outer casing (13) and compose 

thermal insulation spaces (11, 17), and that at least 
one second temperature sensor (12, 20) is located in 

the wall zone of the heat sink and is connected to a 
temperature-regulating device (19) for the 

decomposition vessel (2) and to an arithmetic and 
control unit (18). 
A calorimeter as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that the temperature-regulating device (19) temporarily 

accommodating the decomposition vessel (2) and serving 
for adjusting the temperature of the decomposition 

vessel (2) to the temperature of the heat sink (6) 
prior to a measurement is connected for control to the 

arithmetic and control means (18) and is connected to 
the at least one second temperature sensor. 
A calorimeter as claimed in either of claims 1 or 2, 
characterized in that two second temperature sensors 

(12, 20) are arranged at the heat sink (6), the one  
 

(20) being connected to the temperature-regulating 
device (19) and the other (12) being connected to the 

arithmetic and control means (18). 
A calorimeter as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the heat sink (6) consists of a 

combination of solid and liquid materials.
