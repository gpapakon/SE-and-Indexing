<ABSTRACT>
To bed down in a coffin a person who has died, a cushion-like or mattress-like device (8) is provided. This cushion or this mattress (8) comprises an outer sheath which is produced, at least in part, from a substantially biodegradable polymer, such as for example cellulose, starch, cellulose acetate, gelatine, polycaprolactam or polyvinylalcohol. The cushion or the mattress further comprises chambers (9) or interior spaces, which are intended to be filled in particular with air or a foamable, at least partially rottable material. By means of polymer sheets, produced from the substantially biodegradable polymer, it is furthermore possible to line the coffin, and by means of a covering sheet, which is for example welded to the lining, hermetically seal the coffin off completely from the outside.

Polymer foil for production of a cushion or mattress-like
device for embedding a corpse in a coffin, for lining a

coffin, for sealing a coffin and for production of a sack-like
casing for a corpse, which consists at least partly

of a biologically largely degradable polymer,
characterised in that the foil largely consists of a

polymer or a polymer mixture which comprises at least in
parts thermoplastically processable starch.
Polymer foil according to claim 1, characterised in that
the polymer mixture containing thermoplastically

processable starch also contains cellulose, cellulose
acetate, gelatin, polyhyd
roxy or polyvaleric acid,
polycaprolactone, polyvinylalcohol and/or other

biologically degradable materials which have adequate
water resistance and are biologically degradable.
Cushion or mattress-like device comprising an outer casing
for embedding a corpse in a coffin, characterised in that

at least the casing (8) consists at least partly of a
polymer foil according to any of claims 1 or 2 and

chambers (9) or interior areas are provided in order in
particular to be filled with air or a foamable, at least

partly decayable material.
Device according to claim 3, characterised in that the
inner chambers (9) are designed to be fillable from the

outside with air or a foaming material, where one or more 
filling connectors (11, 11a) are provided which are either

reusable or definitively closable after a single use.
Device according to any of claims 3 or 4, characterised in
that the mattress (8) is in one or more parts and

dimensioned such that it essentially largely covers the
entire coffin base (6).
Device according to any of claims 3 to 5, characterised in
that the mattress (8) has side projecting or overlapping

or welded edge foils (14) to line the side walls (2, 3, 4)
of the coffin (1).
Device according to any of claims 3 to 6, characterised in
that the chambers (9) are tubular, have three, four or

more corners, or are largely round or oval.
Device according to any of claims 3 to 7, characterised in
that the mattress comprises groove-like recesses (17) open

at the top, preferably arranged between chambers (9), to
receive moisture and thus keep the mattress surface

largely dry.
Device according to any of claims 3 to 8, characterised in
that the device is formed as a cushion (18, 20) in order

to serve as a head, neck, arm or foot support cushion.
Device according to any of claims 3 to 9, characterised in
that the casing is decoratively coated, printed, flocked 

or dyed in order to give the exterior of the cushion or
mattress at least almost the appearance of a cloth.
Device according to any of claims 3 to 10, characterised
in that the device is formed as a duvet or quilt or padded

cushion.
Device according to any of claims 3 to 11, characterised
in that a further casing is provided which surrounds the

device on the outside and is made of a cloth.
Cover foil for sealing a coffin, comprising a polymer boil
according to any of claims 1 or 2.
Coffin comprising a device according to any of claims 6 to
12 and a cover foil according to claim 13, characterised

in that the cover foil (25) is connected, preferably
welded or glued, to the edge foil (14) projecting or

overlapping or welded to the side of the mattress.
Sack-like casing for the wrapping, preferably largely
hermetically sealed encasing of a corpse, comprising a

polymer foil according to any of claims 1 or 2.
