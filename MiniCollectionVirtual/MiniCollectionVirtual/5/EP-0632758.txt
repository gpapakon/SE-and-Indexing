<ABSTRACT>
A plastic resin pelletizer system and method for controlling the position of the pellet cutting knife blades (46) in relation to a die plate face (12) includes vibration detection pick-up in the form of a piezoelectric accelerometer (200) mounted to the pelletizer die plate (12). Characteristic frequencies or a signature output is identified as representing the condition of contact between the blades and the die face, and the amplitude of the characteristic signature is used to indicate the extent or degree of pressure of the contact, in controlling the position of the knives with respect to the die plate.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to plastic resin
pelletizers and more particularly to apparatus and method
for the adjustment of pelletizer knives in relation to
the cutting plane or extrusion face of a multiple orifice
extrusion die.Underwater plastic resin pelletizers generally
incorporate either manual or motor driven apparatus for
adjusting the blades of a knife blade assembly in
relation to the cutting surface or face of the extrusion
die. It is important to define and maintain this
relationship to provide prolonged life of the cutting
edges of the knife blades and to ensure proper cutting of
polymers in an effective manner.Various control arrangements have been
suggested for determining the position of the cutting
knives with respect to the die extrusion face, or for
determining when the cutting knives have come into
physical contact with the die face. One such
arrangement, as shown in the U. S. Patent of Holmes et
al, 4,529,370, senses the onset of electrical
conductivity between the rotating knife and the die face.
Such an arrangement, which detect the presence or absence
of conductivity, requires that the knife mounting shaft
and bearings be electrically isolated from the die plate
itself. This results in substantial additional costs and
complications to the design and construction of the
pelletizer.Arrangements which rely upon the presence of
conductivity, to determine the position of the knife, can
only indicate that a knife blade is or is not in contact
with the die plate itself. They cannot accurately or
effectively determine the extent or degree of contact
pressure.A second concept which has been employed for
determining blade position resides in the employment of 
proximity detectors in the die plate as shown in Nagahara
et al, U. S. patent No. 3,912,434. The conductors or
sensors in the die plate are insulated from the nozzles.
A pulse counter is used to determine when contact is
made, as picked up by the sensors. When all of the
knives are contacting, all of the pulses should be
present. However, this arrangement does not provide
accurate information as to the extent or degree of
contacting pressure.A third concept for determining the blade position is the use of
a vibration detecting means, as shown in JP-A-5614810, the
document corresponding to the preamble of claim 1 and 5. The
method of JP-A-5614810 only detects contact, not however the
contact force. The invention is directed to a pelletizer knife
position control apparatus and method in which one or
more characteristic vibrations are

A pelletizer in which plastic resin material is
extruded through orifices (18) formed in the face of a die

plate mounted on a die plate body (12), and a knife assembly (42)
is mounted on a drive shaft (50) and has pellet cutting knife

blades (46) which coact with the face (24) of said die plate and
severs pellets of resin material at said face as said

knife assembly is rotated by said shaft, and a shaft
positioning device axially moves said drive shaft (50) and

said knife assembly (42) thereon toward and away from said die
plate face, comprising


a vibration detecting pickup transducer (200) mounted
in said die plate body (12) and responding to vibrational
