<ABSTRACT>
The thermal printing postage meter includes a base 
supporting a registration wall and a deck, a micro 

controller and a thermal tape cassette detachably mounted to 
the registration wall. A position assembly is provided for 

causing a platen roller to assume a print position or a 
non-print position and for causing the ejection roller to 

assume an engaged or disengaged position. A single motor is 
under the control a micro controller. A linkage system is 

provided which communicates with the motor and a take-up 
spool. The linkage system sequentially causes the position 

assembly to position the platen roller in the print 
position, position the ejection roller in the disengaged 

position and communicating with the take-up spool when the 
motor is rotated in a first direction by the micro 

controller, rotatively drives the platen and rotatively 
driving the take-up spool when the rotation of the motor is 

now driven in a reverse direction by the micro controller, 
causing the first position means to position the platen 

roller in the non-print position, position the ejection 
roller in the engaged position and terminating communication 

with the take-up spool when the motor is again rotated to 
its first direction by the micro controller, and rotatively 

driving the ejection rollers when the rotation of the motor 
is now again driven in the reverse direction by the micro 

controller.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the drive system for 
a thermal printing apparatus and, more particularly, to the 
drive system of a thermal printing postage meter. A thermal printing postage meter system, of the type 
more particularly described in U.S. Patent Application 
Serial No. 07/950,341 is composed 
of a number of system modules. Generally, upon the 
placement of an envelope on the deck of the thermal printer 
by an operator, the envelope is caused to encounter a 
position sensing assembly that includes an envelope stop 
arrangement. The envelope stop arrangement prevents the 
envelope from being longitudinally mis-positioned. Upon 
proper positioning of the envelope on the deck, the position 
sensing assembly senses the presence of the envelope and 
informs a micro controller to first duck the positioning 
sensing assembly out of the way, inclusive of a stop 
assembly, by actuating a first motor, and initiate the print 
sequence. The first motor and its associated drive assembly 
are also responsible for repositioning the platen roller to 
bias the print area of the envelope into contact with the 
print ribbon of a ribbon cassette. During the print cycle, 
the micro controller issues a command to cause second 
motor in combination with its associated drive assembly to 
then drive the platen roller. Rotation of the platen roller 
causes the envelope and cassette print ribbon to 
simultaneously traverse the print head while the micro 
controller concurrently enables the thermal print head. A 
third motor under the control of the micro controller is 
provided which acting through the associated drive assembly 
acts on the take-up spool of the thermal cassette to assure 
that the thermal ribbon remains tight during the printing 
process. Following completion of the print cycle, the micro  
 
controller causes the first motor and its associated drive 
assembly to duck the platen roller below the deck and 
engages the pressure roller for election of the envelope by 
the second motor and its associated drive assembly. The 
ribbon takeup motor stops. This allows the envelope to 
advance while the ribbon remains stationary, thus not using 
ribbon in non-print areas. It is really appreciated, that the presence of three 
motors represents a substantial cost consequence to the 
thermal print system. It shall be further appreciated that 
the cost consequence is compounded since the thermal 
printing system must be precisely controlled and, thereby, 
requiring a precise motor control system and associated
