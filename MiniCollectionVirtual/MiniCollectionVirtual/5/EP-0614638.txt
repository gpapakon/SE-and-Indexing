<ABSTRACT>
Product-holding device for the orderly display-show of 
boxes and product packages in general, constituted by 

two or more bar-elements associated to one another. The 
association of such bar-elements allows to circumscribe 

one or more parallel ways capable of supporting and 
stably hold several packages near to one another, while 

the stretching apart or the bringing near to one another 
of the bar-elements allows to change the width of 

said ways, to allow the positioning of packages of 
different sizes and shapes.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an object-holding device, 
constituted by the horizontal combination of modular 
sectional elements, particularly suitable for supporting 
and displaying prismatic containers, such as boxes 
and various packages of miscellaneous products, such as 
for instance drug packages, toiletries and the like, as 
well as for supporting and displaying items having 
different shapes, such as vases from glass, plastic 
materials or other materials, bottles and the like. As is known, the problem of tidily displaying products 
that are contained in boxes, small bottles and packages 
of different type and size, particularly drugs, toiletries, 
perfumes, medicinal herbs, anf food in general, 
is usually solved, in some cases, by laying out the 
packages side by side on the display surface (for 
instance, shop-windows, shelves and racks in general), 
in other cases, the packages of one only product or of 
several products are arranged on special trays, or the 
like, in order to keep them tidily arranged or placed 
side by side on the supporting surface. In still other cases, the packages of products to be 
displayed, for instance, on counters, are arranged on 
multilevel displayers, often rotatory and/or orientatable, 
so as to permit the choice and taking of the 
products one wishes. In practice, the present systems of presentation-display  
 
of products packaged on sale shelves or in shop-windows 
do not usually maintain stably tidy and arranged 
said products, as would be necessary for both 
practical and aesthetical reasons. Besides, they have 
the drawback of not allowing an easy and quick taking 
of the packages wished and the replenishment of empty 
spaces, as the lack of stabilizing means for the supporting 
surfaces involves almost always an unwished 
shifting and/or disalignment of the packages from the 
starting placement line. In those case in which packages are placed on tray-like 
supports provided with sideboards, it is imposssible to 
arrange on said fixed supports sets of packages having 
different size or shape, exploiting fully the displaying 
capacity of said supports. Therefore, an object of this invention is to provide an 
object-holding device so designed as to allow the 
presentation and/or display of the packages in a stable 
and tidy manner, whatever the size and shape of the 
individual packages may be, and independently on the 
fact that said packages contain different or equal 
products, and such as to allow an easy taking and 
replenishment of the empty spaces
