<ABSTRACT>
The drainage channel exhibits gratings which can be fastened on the channel body without additional fastening means. The channel body (2) exhibits, on its longitudinal sides (15, 16), in each case one guidance and bearing surface (17, 18) for the gratings (1, 1a, 1b) and the latter exhibit, on their two longitudinal sides (9, 10), in each case one bearing surface (13) which corresponds to the guidance and bearing surface (17, 18) on the channel body (2). On one longitudinal side (9) there are arranged, beneath the bearing surface (13), outwardly directed hooks (11) which engage in cutouts (19) arranged beneath the bearing surface (18) on the channel body. Such channel bodies and gratings can be produced cost-effectively and with conventional manufacturing tolerances and permit reliable fastening of the gratings, even in the case of heavy loading.
