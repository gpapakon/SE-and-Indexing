<ABSTRACT>
False floor support having a length-adjustable supporting member between the head and baseplates, of which at least one plate (10), with a concentric receiving section (16) bent out of the plane of the plate by deep-drawing, outwardly encloses a supporting-member end over a considerable length and, with a protrusion which extends concentrically from the plate (10) and is designed, for example, as a turned-in portion (18), guides and surrounds the tubular supporting-member end, that end of the receiving section (16) which is bent out of the plane of the plate being adjoined by a supporting section (12) which is bent back in the direction of the plate and contains deformation regions (28) which are distributed over the periphery of said supporting section and are configured such that, over its periphery, it merges, with different recurring angles, and at different radii into the plate (10).
