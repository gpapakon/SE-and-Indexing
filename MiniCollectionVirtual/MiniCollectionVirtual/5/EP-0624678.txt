<ABSTRACT>
A coordinated installation of textile machinery 
comprises a longitudinally extending support surface (T) 

along which two parallel support belts (1a, 1b) spaced 
at a suitable gap (G) are arranged to slide under the 

influence of a joint indexing drive. A feed station 
(0, 9) at one end feeds stacked pairs of socks so that 

the foot portions are on one belt (1b), the leg portions 
on the other (1a) and the heel portions slide along the 

support surface (T) in the gap (G). A take-off station 
(10,11) at the other end removes and optionally stacks 

pairs of socks after treatment. Along each side of the 
support surface is an elongate support member (F). One 

or more (five are illustrated) transverse bridge members 
(4c-8c) are carried by the elongate support members (F) 

for manipulating and/or incorporating elements on to or 
in the socks are carried on respective bridge members. 

Typically, different folding units (6, 7, 8), and/or a 
paper-incorporating unit (4), and/or a rider-incorporating 

unit (5) can be so supported, either 
selectively or permanently but with selective 

disenablement facilities. Other features such as a 
print head (3) or attachment means (2) for sock-uniting 

clips, can be separately incorporated.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a coordinated installation 
of textile machinery for preparing socks for despatch and 
sale. Although the millions of pairs of socks sold annually 
are manufactured predominantly on high-volume knitting 
machines there has historically been a large and 
labour-intensive handling requirement at the final stages 
e.g. checking, sizing, folding and packaging. Nowadays equipment is available to carry out such 
tasks. For instance, the tubular hosiery constituting 
the main element of the sock is typically knitted as a 
plurality of leg pieces (say) each connected to the next 
by a few breakable threads. Equipment exists for the 
purpose of separating such pieces and stacking them. After such pieces are further fabricated into actual 
socks they are inspected and accurately sized. In 
practice, a nominal size will at this stage have a 
slightly varying leg length (say long - medium - short) 
and slightly vary foot length (say, long or short). 
Machinery now exists to sort and pair socks with closely  
 
similar characteristics, within a nominal sizing, 
replacing labour-intensive visual pairing. Such socks, when formed and trimmed, need further 
operations prior to despatch and sale. The present 
invention is concerned with these further operations, 
such as a variety of possible folds; transfer labelling; 
clipping together at the toe; provision of a unifying 
rider, i.e. a robust wrap-over label locating over the 
welt or toe portions; provision of a paper infill; and 
so on. However, different lengths of sock may need 
different folds; not all socks possess a rider, or a 
paper infill, and some are not tranfer-printed or 
clipped. These final preparation steps therefore 
differ in detail from one textile factory to the next. 
Hitherto equipment has been developed in an 
uncoordinated or piecemeal fashion, alongside such 
labour-intensive operations as may be required. The present invention sets out to provide a 
coordinated installation of textile machinery, 
facilitating selective incorporation of treatment units 
in the number and sequence required, and/or selective 
enabling and disenabling of incorporated treatment units 
in dependence upon changes in the desired treatment 
procedures.  In one aspect the invention consists in an 
installation of textile machinery for preparing pairs of 
socks for despatch and/or sale, comprising: a 
longitudinally extending support surface along which two 
spaced parallel support belts are arranged to slide 
under the influence of a joint

An installation of textile machinery for preparing 
pairs of socks for despatch and/or sale, comprising: a 

longitudinally extending support surface along which two 
spaced parallel support belts are arranged to slide 

under the influence of a joint indexing drive; a feed 
station at one end of the support surface, including a 

means to locate a stacked pair of socks with leg 
portions supported on one belt, heel regions supported 

on the surface in the space between the belts, and foot 
portions supported on the other belt; a take-off 

station at the other end of the support surface for 
removing pairs of socks after treatment; elongate 

parallel support members extending one along each side 
of the support surface; at least one transverse bridge 

member supported on both support members at a selected 
index position of the belts, to extend across the 

support surface; and correspondingly at least one 
treatment unit carried by each transverse bridge member 

for manipulating, and/or incorporating elements on or 
in, a pair of socks arriving at the said selected index 

position. 
An installation as claimed in claim 1 in which a 
control unit is connected to each respective bridge 

member, respective control units having like input 
 

connections for compressed air, electrical power and 
control data. 
An installation as claimed in claim 1 in which two 
or more of the transverse-member-supported units are 

sock-folding units. 
An installation as claimed in claim 3 in which at 
least one folding unit is arranged to fold the foot 

portions of a stacked pair of socks up over the leg 
portion. 
An installation as claimed in claim 3 in which at 
least one folding unit is arranged to fold the foot 

portions of a stacked pair of socks back under the leg 
portion. 
An installation as claimed in claim 3 in which at 
least one folding unit is arranged to fold the upper leg 

portions of a stacked pair of socks back over the lower 
leg portions or over foot portions folded to lie thereon. 
An installation as claimed in claim 1 in which at 
least one of the transverse-member-supported units is an 

incorporation unit. 
An installation as claimed in claim 7 in which the 
incorporation unit is a paper-introduction unit for 

 
sliding a length of paper down within the leg of one 

sock of a stacked pair. 
An installation as claimed in claim 7 in which the 
incorporation unit is a rider-applying unit for 

introducing a rider at one end beneath a welt region of 
one sock of a stacked pair and folding it round to the 

welt region of the other sock. 
An installation as claimed in claim 1 further 
comprising a clipping unit to unite by a metal clip the 

toe portions of the socks of a stacked pair.

comprising a transfer printing unit to transfer indicia 

on a carrier tape by heat to a desired region of a sock 
of a stacked pair. 
An installation as claimed in claim 1 comprising a 
load station incorporating an angled former against 

which stacked pairs of socks can be successively 
positioned for onward indexing by the belts. 
An installation as claimed in claim 1 comprising an

An installation as claimed in claim 1 having three 
folding units and two incorporation units, comprising
