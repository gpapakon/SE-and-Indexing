<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hollow laminated 
molded article composed of a fiber-reinforced thermoplastic 
resin and a method for producing it. In the prior art, a molded article made of resin is 
mainly formed by laminating fiber-reinforced low molecular 
weight thermosetting resin plates and heating and molding 
them. However, the thermosetting resin has a low molecular 
weight, so that there is such a problem than the resin 
generates odors such as a styrene monomer odor in the case 
of an unsaturated polyester resin and an amine odor in the 
case of an epoxy resin during production operation, and bad 
influences are exerted on human bodies. In addition, also during the lamination, the resin 
is not integrated with reinforcing fibers, so that they are 
apt to deviate during the molding, and wrinkles are apt to 
occur. Thus, a considerable degree of technical skill is 
required for the molding, and a considerable period of time  
 
is also required for curing of a molded article, so that 
there are such problems that such a molding apparatus 
becomes extremely expensive, and production cost also 
becomes high. Thus, production of molded articles has been tried 
using fiber-reinforced resin plates including thermoplastic 
resins which can be relatively easily handled. As such one, in addition to a method described in an 
official gazette of Japanese Patent Laid-open Application 
No. 1-286823 entitled "Continuous shaping method and its 
apparatus for fiber-reinforced resin molded articles", there 
are generally known a method in which fiber-reinforced 
resin plates are heated and softened followed by 
pressurizing and molding at a high pressure in a mold using 
a pressing machine, that is a press molding method in which 
a predetermined number the fiber-reinforced resin plates 
are laminated on a surface of a male mold or a female mold, 
the molds are closed to perform pressurizing while heating 
them to not less than a temperature capable of fluidization 
of the resin, followed by cooling to not more than a 
melting temperature of the resin and performing mold 
release, and an autoclave molding method in which laminated 
fiber-reinforced resin plates are introduced into a mold,  
 
they are heated to not less than a temperature capable of 
fluidization under vacuum to perform shaping and 
deaeration, and thereafter the temperature in the mold is 
lowered to room temperature to perform mold release and the 
like. In these methods, generally it is possible to 
produce a shell-shaped molded article
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A hollow and cylindrical laminated molded 
product, wherein said product comprises at least one or more 

lengthy laminated articles (1, 2), said articles being 
formed by layered lamination of fiber-reinforced 

thermoplastic resin plates containing reinforcing fibers of 
not less than 30 % and not more than 85 % in weight 

content, said plates being able to be molded at a 
relatively low pressure, edge portions in a longitudinal 

direction of said articles (1, 2) being mutually overlapped 
and joined. 
A laminated molded product according to 
claim 1 wherein the reinforcing fiber is woven cloth. 
A laminated molded product according to 
claim 1 wherein the reinforcing fiber is stretched and 

aligned in one direction. 
A laminated molded product according to any 
one of claims 1 to 3 wherein each of the fiber-reinforced 

 
thermoplastic resin plates has a thickness of not less than 

0.05 mm and not more than 1 mm. 
A laminated molded product according to any 
one of claims 1 to 4 wherein a resin in a melted state in 

the fiber-reinforced thermoplastic resin plate has a melt 
viscosity of not less than 100 poise and not more than 5000 

poise. 
A production method for laminated products 
comprising: 

   a step in which at least one or more laminated 
articles (1, 2) formed by layered lamination of fiber-reinforced 

thermoplastic resin plates containing 
reinforcing fibers of not less than 30 % and not more than 

85 % in weight content capable of low pressure molding are 
heated, so that a thermoplastic resin thereof is allowed to 

be in a melted state to perform deaeration of air contained 
between layers; 

   a step in which the laminated articles (1, 2) in 
which said thermoplastic resin is in the melted state are 

arranged around a molding tool (3) having a desired cross-sectional 
shape;

 
   a step in which said laminated articles (1, 2) are 

closely contacted with an outer peripheral surface of the 
molding tool (3) so that the molding tool (3) is wrapped in 

a state in which side edge portions of each of the 
laminated articles are mutually overlapped with side edge 

portions of the other adjoining laminated article to provide 
closing
 in a loop shape, and the laminated articles (1, 2) 
are mutually joined and integrated, and 

   a step in which said integrated laminated article is 
cooled. 
A production method for laminated products

molding tool (3) is withdrawn after the cooling. 
A production method for laminated products 
according to claim 6 or 7 wherein the molding tool is a 

rod-shaped body. 
A production method for laminated products 
according to claim 6 or 7 wherein the molding tool is a 

hollow and cylindrical body. 
A production method for laminated products 
according to claim 9 wherein a hollow molding tool having 

venting holes (3e) at circumferential walls is used as the 
molding tool (3), and in the process of cooling said article 

after completion of the step in which the heated laminated 
articles (1, 2) are closely contacted with the outer 

peripheral surface of the molding tool and integrated, 
while the laminated articles have a temperature of not more 

than a melting point and not less than a softening point of 
the thermoplastic resin, compressed air is supplied to the 

inside of the molding tool (3), air extruded from the 
venting holes (3e) is used to form an air layer (6) between 

the outer peripheral surface of the molding tool and an 
inner circumferential face of the laminated article so as 

to release the integrated molded article from the outer 
peripheral surface of the molding tool, and thereafter the 

molding tool (3) is withdrawn.
