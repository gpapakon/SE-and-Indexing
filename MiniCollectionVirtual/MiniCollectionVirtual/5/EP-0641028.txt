<ABSTRACT>
A thin film device includes a substrate, a 
conductive oxide film formed on the substrate, and a 

metal film formed on the substrate and in contact with 
at least a part of the conductive oxide film. The 

metal film includes aluminum and a metallic material. 

The metallic material has a standard electrode potential 
higher than the standard electrode potential of 

the aluminum so that the standard electrode potential 
of the metal film is higher than the reduction potential 

of the conductive oxide film. This metallic material could be, 
for example, tungsten or paladium.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a thin film
device and a method for fabricating the same. More
particularly, the invention relates to a thin film
device having a transparent electrode made of conductive
oxide film, for example, thin film devices such as
liquid crystal display devices, electro-luminescence
display devices and photoelectric transducer devices,
and a method for fabricating the same.Thin film devices which employ conductive
oxide films as transparent electrodes include liquid
crystal display devices, electro-luminescence display
devices and photoelectric transducer devices. A technology
which uses a transparent electrode made of a
conductive oxide will be described below, taking an
example of an active matrix type liquid crystal display
device.An active matrix type liquid crystal display
device generally has an active matrix substrate, an
opposing substrate and a liquid crystal film interposed
between the two substrates. The active matrix substrate
has a plurality of gate bus lines, a plurality
of source bus lines arranged at right angles to the
gate bus lines, and a plurality of pixel electrodes
arranged within regions enclosed by these bus lines,
being formed thereon. Each of the pixel electrodes
receives a data signal from the source bus line via a
thin film transistor (hereinafter referred to as TFT) 
which switches on or off in response to a scanning
signal transmitted on the corresponding gate bus line.
The opposing substrate has a transparent opposing electrode.With reference to Figure 6, a TFT of prior
art will be described below.As shown in Figure 6, the TFT has a gate
electrode 2 formed on a substrate 1, a gate insulating
film 3 formed over the gate electrode 2, an amorphous
silicon (a-Si) film 4 formed on the gate insulating
film 3, phosphorous-doped a-Si contact films 5 formed
on the a-Si film 4, barrier metal layers 7, and
source/drain electrodes 8a and 8b made of aluminum
(Al). The gate electrode 2, the gate insulating film 3
and the a-Si film 4 may be arranged in a reversed
order. The drain electrode 8b is connected to a pixel
electrode 6 made from a transparent conductive film.
As the material for the transparent conductive film,
indium-tin oxide (ITO) is commonly used (cf. for example
Patent Abstracts of Japan, vol. 13, 116 and JP-A-63 289 533).A process of fabricating the TFT will be
described below. First, a Cr film is deposited on the
glass substrate 1 and the gate electrode 2 is formed
from the Cr film in the photolithography process. Then
the gate insulating film 3
