<ABSTRACT>
A state estimator (40) generates a plurality of candidates of estimated desired signal sequences corresponding 
to the transitions of state of desired signals estimated to be received, and a plurality of candidates of estimated 

undesired signal sequences corresponding to the transitions of state of undesired signals sequentially. The candidates 
are sent to a desired signal estimator (10) and a undesired signal estimator (20), respectively. In accordance with the 

conversion parameters set from a channel parameter estimator (50), the estimators (10 and 20) generate an estimated 
desired signal and an estimated undesired signal by use of the respective candidates. An error estimator (30) subtracts 

a signal of the sum of these signals from the received signal and generates an estimated error signal ε. The state 
estimator (40) estimates estimated error of desired signal sequences and undesired signal sequences with respect to 

the generated sequence candidates.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an interference
signal cancelling method and a receiver using the same
and, more particularly, to an interference signal
cancelling method which compensates for the degradation of
transmission characteristics due to co-channel or similar
interference signals from other adjacent cells in digital
mobile radio communication and a receiver and a
communication system using such an interference signal
cancelling method.There have already been proposed several types of
receivers that generate replicas from transmission symbol
candidates for desired and interference signals and
transmission line parameters corresponding to these two
signals, subtract these replicas from a received signal to
obtain an error signal, multiply the square of the error
signal by -1 and use the resulting signal as a log
likelihood to make a maximum likelihood decision by a
maximum likelihood sequence estimator for desired and
inter-channel interference signals under inter-symbol
interference generating environment.For example, W. Van Etten has proposed, as a
maximum likelihood sequence estimator, a receiver using
the Viterbi algorithm (W. Van Etten, "Maximum Likelihood
Receiver for Multiple channel Transmission System," IEEE
Trans. on Comm., Feb., 1976). However, this receiver is
based on the assumption that the value of the impulse
response of the transmission line is preknown. A receiver
of the type that estimates transmission line parameters
and employs a maximum likelihood sequence estimator has 
been proposed by Howard E. Nicols, Arithur A. Giordano and
Jhon G. Proakis. According to their proposal, the
transmission line parameters are estimated and updated by
an adaptation algorithm through use of an estimated value
for a symbol detection which is outputted from the maximum
likelihood sequence estimator after being delayed for the
same period of time as a received signal sample delayed
for a fixed period of time. This receiver operates well
when the radio channel undergoes relatively slow time-variations.
In the mobile radio channel, however, since
the amplitudes and phases of desired and interference
signals vary at high speed, the estimated value of the
received signal sample which is delayed for a fixed period
of time, as proposed by Howard E. Nicols, Arithur A.
Giordano and Jhon G. Proakis, is no longer a current
estimated value, the transmission characteristic is
seriously degraded.To improve the characteristic of an adaptive
equalizer based on the maximum likelihood sequence
estimation
