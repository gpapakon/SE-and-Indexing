<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to conductive polymer compositions, methods of making
such compositions, and electrical devices comprising such compositions.Conductive polymer compositions and electrical devices comprising them are
well-known. Such compositions comprise a polymer, and dispersed in the polymer, a
conductive particulate filler. The type and quantity of the conductive particles, as well
as the type of the polymer, influence the resistivity of the composition. Generally for
compositions with resistivities greater than about 1 ohm-cm, carbon black is a preferred
filler. For compositions with lower resistivities, metal particles are used.
Compositions comprising carbon black are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,237,441
(van Konynenburg et al), 4,388,607 (Toy et al), 4,534,889 (van Konynenburg et al),
4,560,498 (Horsma et al), 4,591,700 (Sopory), 4,724,417 (Au et al), 4,774,024
(Deep et al), 4,935,156 (van Konynenburg et al), and 5,049,850 (Evans et al).
Compositions comprising metal fillers are described in U.S. Patent No. 4,545,926
(Fouts et al) and in U.S. Application No. 07/788,655 (Baigrie et al), filed November 6,
1991.In order to improve the electrical stability of conductive polymers it has been
found that the addition of an inorganic filler such as alumina trihydrate is useful. Such
compositions comprising carbon black, which are particularly useful for high voltage
applications, i.e. exposure to voltages greater than about 100 volts, are described in
U.S. Patent Nos. 4,774,024 (Deep et al) and 5,049,850 (Evans et al). In addition,
metal-filled compositions have been found to be more stable when a second filler, either
another conductive filler such as a metal or carbon black or a nonconductive filler such
as alumina trihydrate, is present. Such compositions are described in U.S. Patent No.
4,545,926 (Fouts et al). These metal-filled compositions are designed to minimize
resistance increase after exposure to high temperature conditions. High temperature
conditions occur either as a result of cycling between an electrically powered and an 
unpowered state, or as a result of passive thermal treatment. Despite the objective of
maintaining a relatively constant room temperature resistance after such exposure, these
metal-filled compositions often do increase in resistance on cycling. Furthermore, it is
difficult to make them reproducibly at a given low resistivity value.We have further discovered,
that conductive polymers having improved properties can be obtained
by a conductive polymer
