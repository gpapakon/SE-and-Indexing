<ABSTRACT>
Linear or straight-chain trimethylsiloxy endcapped 
methylhydrogen polysiloxanes are made by contacting 

hexamethyldisiloxane with a highly pure methylhydrogen 
cyclic siloxane, in the presence of anhydrous 

trifluoromethane sulfonic acid catalyst at room temperature. 
Trimethylsiloxy endcapped alkylmethyl siloxanes are made by 

reacting the linear or straight-chain trimethylsiloxy 
endcapped methylhydrogen polysiloxanes with an alpha-olefin, 

in the presence of a platinum catalyst. Alkylmethyl cyclic 
siloxanes containing zero parts per million residual ≡SiH, 

are made by reacting anhydrous alpha-olefins and a highly 
pure methylhydrogen cyclic siloxane, in the presence of 

dried platinum catalyst supported on carbon particles.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to methods for preparing linear or
straight-chain polysiloxanes.US-A-5,395,956 discloses a process for preparing cyclic
organohydrogensiloxanes, in which an organohydrogendichlorosilane is reacted
with water. The hydrolyzate is contacted with an acidic rearrangement catalyst.EP-A-0,641,799 discloses a process for the production of pristine
alkylsiloxanes in which an SiH containing siloxane polymer and an olefinic
compound are reacted in the presence of a supported platinum catalyst and
oxygen.US-A-2,491,843 discloses a linear trimethylsiloxy endcapped
methylhydrogen polysiloxane having a degree of polymerisation of up to 500.The present invention provides a method of making linear
triorganosiloxy endcapped methylhydrogen polysiloxanes comprising (i) forming
a reaction mixture containing a silanol-free (1ppm or less residual ≡SiOH or
within the detection limits of Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy)
hexaorganodisiloxane, one or more silanol-free (1ppm or less residual ≡SiOH
or within the detection limits of Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy)
methylhydrogen cyclic siloxanes, and less than 100 parts per million water, (ii)
contacting the reaction mixture with anhydrous trifluoromethane sulfonic acid
catalyst, and (iii) agitating the mixture and the catalyst at below 100°C, to form
a linear triorganosiloxy endcapped methylhydrogen polysiloxane having a degree
of polymerization of 750-2200 and containing less than 0.2% branch sites.The invention also provides a linear triorganosiloxy endcapped
methylhydrogen polysiloxane having a degree of polymerization of 750-2200 and
containing less than 0.2% branch sites.The invention further provides a method of making triorganosiloxy
endcapped alkylmethyl siloxanes comprising contacting and reacting a linear
triorganosiloxy endcapped methylhydrogen polysiloxane as defined above, with
an alpha-olefin, in the presence of a platinum catalyst, until a triorganosiloxy
endcapped alkylmethyl siloxane containing less than 200 parts per million
hydrogen as residual ≡SiH is formed. Acid equilibration (polymerization) of siloxanes
such as tetramethylcyclotetrasiloxane (DH4) and
pentamethylcyclopentasiloxane (DH5) has been performed in
the past. Our invention, however, relates in one embodiment to the
polymerization of highly pure silanol-free hexamethyldisiloxane
and highly pure mixtures of silanol-free DH4 and
DH5 containing no more than 100 parts per million (ppm)
water, with anhydrous trifluoromethane sulfonic acid
(triflic acid, CF3SO3H),
