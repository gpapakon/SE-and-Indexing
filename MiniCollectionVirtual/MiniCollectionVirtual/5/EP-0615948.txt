Filling valve for a vessel-filling machine, more 
especially for decanting drinks into vessels such as 

bottles, cans and the like under counter-pressure, the 
filling valve including a raisable and lowerable gas 

pipe, which is guided internally of a valve closing 
means, and a bell-shaped centring means, which is 

raisable and lowerable independently of said gas pipe, 
for sealing the mouth of the vessel from the ambient 

atmosphere, and the control movements of the valve, or 
respectively of the displaceable valve members, being 

able to be introduced at least partially by a rotatable 
pinion, which is actuatable externally of the tank 

accommodating the filling valves, and said pinion is 
provided with control cams, characterised in that a 

first spring (18) is provided, which holds the gas pipe 
(15) and the valve closing means (8) at a spacing from 

each other, the gas pipe (15) being fitted onto an upper 
stop member (22) of the valve closing means (8) by means 

of a control cam, in that a second spring (25) is 
provided on the valve closing means (8) and has a 

greater initial tension than the first spring (18), and 
in that, during the downward rotation of the control cam 

(13), the gas pipe (15) is detached from its upper stop 
member (22) by means of a lifting movement and brought 

into its lower end position against a lower stop member 
(30) by means of the first spring, the valve closing 

means (8) remaining in its closed position and being 
able to be brought into the open position in opposition 

to the force of the first spring (18) as a result of the 
control cam (13) acting on the second spring (25). 
Filling valve according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the valve closing means (8) is 

retained in the closed position by means of the gas pipe  
 

(15), due to the internal pressure of the tank acting on 
a sealing member (23) of the gas pipe (15), via a stop 

connection (21, 22) which is effective in opposition to 
the force of a spring (18). 
Filling valve according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the first spring (18) executes the 

closing movement of the valve closing means (8) while 
the gas pipe (15) still remains in the lower stop 

position when the second spring (25) is relieved of 
pressure. 
Filling valve according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that, during a lifting movement of the 

control cam (13), the latter can be fitted against the 
lower end face of a sealing member (23) or on a 

different stop member of the gas pipe (15) and moves the 
sealing member (23) towards the inner end face of the 

tank (2). 
Filling valve according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the sealing member (23) of the gas 

pipe (15) is retained in the upper position by the 
internal pressure of the tank once the gas chamber of 

the vessel had been relieved of pressure. 
Filling valve according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that there is a connection with the 

pressurising valve when the sealing member is in the 
upper stop position. 
Filling valve according to the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the preliminary pressurisation of  

 
the vessel interior can be introduced by closing a 

rinsing valve (5). 
Filling valve according to the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the valve closing means (8) can be 

brought into the open position in a spring locking 
manner and by the rotational movement of the control cam 

(13). 
Filling valve according to the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the gas pipe (15) is connectable 

to the supply line (34) of an annular chamber for 
sterilising agents (33) in the upper stop position. 
Filling valve according to claim 9, 
characterised in that the annular chamber for 

sterilising agents (33) is configured as part of the 
annular tank (2). 
Filling valve according to claim 9, 
characterised in that the annular chamber for 

sterilising agents (33) is retained on the annular tank 
(2) at a spacing therefrom by isolating means.
