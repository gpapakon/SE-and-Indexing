<ABSTRACT>
A stop-log device for retaining high water or the like, with beam-like stop-log elements (2) which can be arranged one above the other in a horizontal position, are designed as hollow sections and engage at their ends in roughly U-shaped receptacles (1), seals (4) being provided between the bearing surfaces of the stop-log elements (2) and inside the receptacles (1). In order to be able to assemble the stop-log device simply, safely and quickly, extensions (5) in the longitudinal direction are provided at the end faces of the stop-log elements (2), and locking elements (3) interacting with these extensions (5) can be inserted into the receptacles (1). In the locking position, the locking elements (3) are supported in the receptacles (1) and exert a bearing pressure, directed at least vertically downwards, on the stop-log elements (2).

Blocking device for holding back high water or the like, with beam-like 
blocking elements (2), which can be arranged one above the other in 

horizontal position and are constructed as hollow profiles and which 
engage by their ends in approximately U-shaped receptacles, wherein seals 

(4) are provided between the contact surfaces of the blocking elements 
(2) and within the receptacles (1), characterised thereby that 

projections (5) extending in longitudinal direction are provided at the 
end faces of the blocking elements (2) and locking elements (3, 18) co-operating 

with these projections (5) are insertable into the receptacles 
(1), are supported in the receptacles (1) in locking setting and exert on 

the blocking elements (2) a pressing force directed at least vertically 
downwardly. 
Blocking device according to claim 1, characterised thereby, that the 
locking elements (3) and the projections (5) at the blocking elements (2) 

are substantially mechanically positively connectible together for 
lateral displacement of the blocking elements (2) against the seals (4) 

of the receptacles (1). 
Blocking device according to claim 1 or 2, characterisedthereby that 
the blocking elements are formed as wedge elements (3), which can be 

arranged on the projections (5) of the blocking elements (2) and in 
locking setting are drivable into counterbearings (16) at the receptacles 

(1) under exertion on the blocking elements (2) of a pressing force 
directed at least vertically downwardly. 
Blocking device according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised 
thereby that the counterbearing (16) has lateral abutments (7) for a 

lateral displacement of the locking elements (3) or the blocking elements 
(3) mechanically positively connected therewith against the seals (4) in 

the receptacles (1).  
 
Blocking device according to one or more of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised thereby that for formation of a mechanically positive 

connection between locking elements (3) and blocking elements (2) at 
least the projections (5) of the blocking elements (2) have a profiling 

(12) extending in longitudinal direction on their upper side and the 
locking elements (3) have a corresponding counter profiling (17) on their 

lower side. 
Blocking device according to claim 5, characterised thereby that the 
blocking elements (2) together with the projections (5) have a continuous 

profiling (9, 12), wherein the profiling (12) of the projection (5) is 
offset in its height with respect to the profiling (12) of the blocking 

element (2). 
Blocking device according to one or more of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised thereby that the locking elements (3) have at their end 

face, which is rearward in locking setting, a recess for engagement of a 
tool. 
Blocking device according to one or more of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised thereby that the locking elements (3) are constructed to be 

symmetrical in longitudinal direction and preferably consist of plastics 
material. 
Blocking device according to one or more of the preceding claims, 
characterised thereby that angle profiles (6) with recesses, which are 

arranged to be displaced in height and form the counterbearings (16), for 
the locking elements (3) are provided in the oppositely disposed corner 

regions of the U-shaped receptacles (1) and the lateral abutments (7) are 
formed as flat strips arranged in the corner region of the angle profiles 

(6). 
Blocking device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised thereby that the lateral abutments (7) are arranged on the 

water side of the receptacles (1).  
 
Blocking device according to claim 1 or 2, characterised thereby 
that the locking elements are constructed as eccentric bolts (18) which 

are pluggable into the limbs of the U-shaped receptale (1) and, on a 
rotational movement, act by its outer shell (28) on the upper side of the 

respective projection (5) of the blocking element (2) under exertion of a 
vertical pressing force. 
Arrangement according to claim 11, characterised thereby that the 
eccentric bolt (18) has a chamfer (21) which in the installed setting is 

inclined relative to a vertical plane and which engages at the one 
lateral surface (22) of the projection (5) of the blocking element (2) 

and on a rotational movement of the eccentric bolt (18) exerts a lateral 
pressing force on the blocking element (2) in the direction of the 

sealing strips (4) arranged at the one limb of the receptacles (1). 
Blocking device according to claim 12, characterised thereby that 
the chamfer (21) is formed as an approximately spirally wound contact 

surface (20), in a given case with a run-up chamfer (21). 
Blocking device according to claim 13, characterised thereby that 
the spiral abutment surface (20) goes over, preferably after about half a 

thread pitch, into a contact surface (23), preferably with a flattening 
(25) bringing to bear a detent setting, parallel with respect to the 

lateral surface (22) of the projection (5). 
Blocking device according to one of claims 11 to 14, characterised 
thereby that the eccentric bolt is sealingly mounted, preferably on its 

end opposite the sealing strip (4) at the one limb of the receptacle (1), 
at the receptacle (1). 
Blocking device according to one or more of claims 11 to 15, 
characterised thereby that the eccentric pin has at its one end an 

attachment (24) for a tool.  
 
Blocking device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised thereby that dogs (10), which are preferably semicircular, 

are provided at the limbs, which are at the water side, of the 
receptacles (1) as insertion aid and for alignment at least of the 

lowermost blocking element (2).
