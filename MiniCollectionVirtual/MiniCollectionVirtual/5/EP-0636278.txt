<ABSTRACT>
Photovoltaic cell comprising means providing protection against electrostatic charges, method of manufacture thereof and solar panel incorporating same. Said photovoltaic cell comprises an effective, low-weight system for removing electrostatic charges with only minor masking of incident solar radiation. Said system consists of a grid of transparent or non-transparent conductive material on the external surface of the protective glass cover of the cell. The grid is connected to the cell capture electrode and, advantageously, is positioned directly above the electrode grid collecting the charges generated by the photovoltaic cell.
