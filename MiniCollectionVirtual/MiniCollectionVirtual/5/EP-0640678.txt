<ABSTRACT>
A process for hydrotreating a heavy hydrocarbon 
oil, wherein the formation of coke is markedly reduced during 

operation whereby problems associated with the formation of 
coke, such as an increase in pressure drop in preheaters, a 

decrease in catalytic activity, clogging of apparatus and 
impairment of the quality of products, can be solved; 

therefore, a long-run operation of the hydrotreating plant in 
a stable state becomes possible. The present process is 

constituted of charging a heavy hydrocarbon oil feedstock to 
a hydrotreating reactor with a thermally treated hydrocarbon 

oil which is obtained by the thermal treatment of a 
hydrotreated heavy hydrocarbon oil boiling at above 250°C, 

and/or with a thermally treated hydrocarbon oil which is 
obtained by the thermal treatment of a fluid catalytically 

cracked petroleum boiling at above 250°C, and hydrotreating 
the charged feedstock in the presence of a hydrotreating 

catalyst, wherein said thermal treatment is accomplished at 
400 to 600°C, the amount of thermally treated hydrocarbon oil 

is 0.3 to 10% by weight on the basis of the heavy hydrocarbon 
oil feedstock, aromatic rings of said thermally treated 

hydrocarbon oil is partially hydrogenated prior to charging 
if necessary, and the hydrotreating catalyst is preferably a 

specific catalyst which satisfies a specific pore size 
distribution.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
hydrotreating a heavy hydrocarbon oil, and particularly to a 
process for hydrotreating a heavy hydrocarbon oil wherein the 
formation of carbonaceous material can be markedly reduced by 
incorporating a small amount of specific oil into the heavy 
hydrocarbon oil feedstock. Although hydrotreating has been practiced as a 
major process for converting heavy hydrocarbon oils into 
light hydrocarbon oils, a problem associated with the process 
is the formation of carbonaceous material (coke) which 
increases pressure drop and decreases catalyst activity, and 
causes the clogging of apparatus, and deteriorates the 
quality of products when an asphaltenes-containing heavy 
hydrocarbon oil such as topped crudes and vacuum residues is 
converted. Several reports have appeared, showing that the 
hydrotreating of a heavy hydrocarbon oil in the presence of a 
hydrogen-donor substance is effective for controlling the 
formation of coke. Recycling of part of hydrocracked oil to  
 
the reactor has been practiced in this respect; however, in 
these prior art processes, a great amount of hydrogen-donor 
substance needs to be added or recycling of hydrocracked oil 
is required, in addition to the fact that the effect of these 
additives for controlling the formation of coke is still 
insufficient. A principal object of the present invention is to 
provide an improved process for hydrotreating heavy 
hydrocarbon oils which will allow the hydrotreating of heavy 
hydrocarbon oils for longer continuous periods of time in a 
stable state by reducing the formation of coke, thereby 
solving the problems associated with the coke formation. The applicant of the invention has intensively 
researched to solve the foregoing problems, and as a result, 
has found that the formation of carbonaceous material may be 
greatly reduced by the incorporation of a small amount of 
specific oil into the heavy hydrocarbon oil feedstock. The 
present inventions are based on this finding. That is, the first aspect of the present invention 
is directed to a process for hydrotreating a heavy 
hydrocarbon oil, wherein the process comprises charging a 
heavy hydrocarbon oil feedstock to a hydrotreating reactor 
with a thermally treated hydrocarbon oil which is obtained by  
 
the thermal treatment of a hydrotreated heavy hydrocarbon oil 
boiling at above 250°C, and/or with a thermally treated 
hydrocarbon oil which is obtained by the thermal treatment of 
a fluid catalytically cracked petroleum oil
