A process for preparing sun protection compositions is 
describe
d. An aqueous dispersion of a particulate metallic oxide 
in which the primary particle size is less than 0.2 micrometre is 

mixed with an emulsifier and an oil phase to form an oil-in-water 
emulsion and also with a hydrophobic organic sunscreen. The 

amount of metallic oxide present in the emulsion is up to 10 per 
cent by weight and the amount of hydrophobic organic sunscreen 

present is up to 7 per cent by weight. The use of an aqueous 
emulsion of inorganic oxide together with a hydrophobic organic 

sunscreen produces a composition having a higher Sun Protection 
Factor (SPF) than would be expected as an additive effect 

produced by the quantities of metallic oxide and organic sunscreen 
used.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to compositions for application to
human skin and particularly to compositions containing a
combination of inorganic and organic sunscreens.The use of inorganic oxides which have a particle size such
that they are substantially transparent to visible light but reflect or
absorb UV light to provide sunscreen compositions is known.
However, in order to produce a sunscreen composition having a
high sun protection factor (SPF) it is sometimes necessary to use
relatively large amounts of such oxides and this can lead to
undesirable visible tinting due to a small absorbance of visible
light.A combination of an inorganic oxide and an organic
sunscreen can be used to obtain a high SPF with a relatively small
amount of inorganic oxide but physiological damage to the body
can occur following topical application of organic sunscreens in
effective concentrations and consequently safety limits have been
imposed on the quantity which is permitted in a composition for
topical application.It is therefore desirable to produce compositions which
optimise the effectiveness of compounds used as UV absorbers
and it is an object of this invention to provide a method of
preparing compositions which improve the effectiveness of a
combination of inorganic and organic UV absorbers. Some compositions having
improved effectiveness are disclosed in EP-A-0 456 458.According to the invention a process for the preparation of
a composition suitable for topical application to human skin
comprises mixing an aqueous dispersion of particles of a metallic
oxide having an average primary particle size of less than 0.2
micrometre with one or more emulsifiers and an oil phase under
conditions in which an oil-in-water emulsion is formed and with a
hydrophobic organic sunscreen wherein the composition contains
up to 10 per cent by weight metallic oxide and up to 7 per cent by
weight hydrophobic organic sunscreen provided that said hydrophobic organic sunscreen does
not comprise isoamyl p-methoxy cinnamate. Compositions prepared according to the process of the
invention have been shown to possess an SPF which is
considerably greater than would be expected by calculating an SPF
based on the additive effect of the metallic oxide and the organic
sunscreen.A particularly preferred embodiment of the process of the
invention is based on the process described in the pending
application filed in the United Kingdom under the application
.number GB 9301515.4. According to this preferred embodiment a
process for the preparation of a
