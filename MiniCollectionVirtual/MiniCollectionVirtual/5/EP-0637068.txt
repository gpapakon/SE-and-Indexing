<ABSTRACT>
In the manufacture of a liquid-crystal display or other large 
area electronic device, thin-film transistors are formed on a 

substrate (10) from a thin film (1) of disordered semiconductor 
material which accommodates the transistor channel regions and has 

a high density of trapping states. A masking pattern (13) masks 
areas of the semiconductor film (1) where the thin-film transistors 

are to be formed. The unmasked areas of the film (1) are etched 
away to leave the semiconductor film bodies for the transistors. 

The resulting transistors are found to have an undesirable leakage 
current through the channel region, even after adopting several 

prior art measures to reduce the high leakage. By implanting a 
dopant stripe (5) along their edges, the present invention reduces 

leakage currents along the edges of the channel region in the 
etched disordered semiconductor material (1). The implantation of 

ions (15) is effected through bevelled edge portions (13) of the 
masking pattern (13) so as to form the dopant stripe (5) across the 

thickness of the semiconductor film material (10). The thickness 
of the masking pattern (13) is sufficient to mask against 

implantation of the ions (15) except below the bevelled edge 
portions (14). The technology is compatible with the use of a 

substrate (10) not able to withstand temperatures of more than 
about 700
o
C.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods of manufacturing an 
electronic device comprising thin-film transistors formed on a 
substrate. The device may be, for example, a liquid crystal 
display or other flat panel display, or any other type of large 
area electronic device, for example, a thin-film data store or an 
image sensor. The invention also relates to such electronic 
devices manufactured by such methods. There is currently much interest in developing thin-film 
field-effect transistors (hereinafter termed "TFTs") on glass and 
other insulating substrates for large area electronics 
applications, for example flat panel displays. Such TFTs 
fabricated with amorphous or polycrystalline semiconductor films 
may form, for example, switching elements of a cell matrix, e.g. as 
described in published European patent application EP-A-0 464 897 
(our reference PHB 33646), the whole contents of which are hereby 
incorporated herein as reference material. A recent development 
involves the fabrication and integration of circuits from TFTs 
(often using polycrystalline silicon), for example integrated drive 
circuits for the matrix of a flat-panel display. In the manufacture of such electronic devices, it is usual to 
form thin-film transistors on a substrate by steps which include: 
(a) depositing a disordered material on the substrate to provide a 
semiconductor film in which channel regions of the transistors are 
to be accommodated, charge-trapping states being present in the 
semiconductor film, (b) providing a masking pattern on the 
semiconductor film to mask areas where the thin-film transistors 
are to be formed, (c) etching away the unmasked areas of the film 
from the substrate to leave semiconductor film bodies for the 
transistors, and (d) providing the semiconductor film bodies with  
 
electrodes forming a source, a drain and an insulated gate of each 
transistor, the transistor current flow through the channel region 
between the source and drain being by charge carriers of a first 
conductivity type under the control of the insulated gate in 
operation of the transistor. For polycrystalline silicon TFTs, the semiconductor film may 
be deposited as polycrystalline silicon, or it may be deposited as 
amorphous silicon which is subsequently converted in situ on the 
substrate into polycrystalline silicon by heating either in a 
furnace or with a laser beam. However, even when the resulting 
film is of large grain polycrystalline silicon, it has a high 
density of charge trapping states due to the
