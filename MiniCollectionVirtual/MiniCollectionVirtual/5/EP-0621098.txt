<ABSTRACT>
The casting apparatus comprises a metallurgical vessel equipped with a casting port (6), a casting gate comprising: at least one stationary refractory plate (14) including a port placed opposite the casting port; at least one movable refractory plate (16) including at least one port; displacement means (28) for displacing the movable plate (16) with respect to the stationary plate (14) so as to control the covering-over of the port of the stationary plate (14) and of the movable plate (16); means (26) for pressing the movable plate (16) against the stationary plate (14). The casting port (6) of the metallurgical vessel includes a surface (8) of joining to the stationary plate (14) of the casting gate. The stationary plate (14) includes a joining surface (32) adapted to the surface (8). Pressure means (30) make it possible to press the joining surface (32) of the stationary plate (14) against the joining surface (8) of the casting port so that a leaktight seal is guaranteed between these two surfaces in the absence of mortar, a cemented join or fibres, adhesive or any other means added to guarantee the leaktight seal.
