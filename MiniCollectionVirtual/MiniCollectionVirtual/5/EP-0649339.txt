<ABSTRACT>
A rotary kiln, particularly for producing uranium dioxide from uranium hexafluoride, has an inlet arrangement (1) and a heated rotatable barrel (14). Uranium hexafluoride and steam react together in the inlet arrangement (1) to form uranyl fluoride which is fed into the barrel (14) by the aid of a rotating scroll feed device (17). In the barrel, the uranyl fluoride reacts with a counterflow stream of steam and hydrogen to produce the uranium dioxide. A porous metal or ceramic filter (28) closely surrounds the scroll feed device (17) to remove particles from kiln-produced gases. The filter is maintained in a clean condition by the scraping action of a number of helical blades forming part of the scroll feed device (17). The uranium dioxide powder produced by the kiln may be processed to form nuclear fuel pellets.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to rotary kilns in which 
gaseous reactions are carried out to form a solid product. 
The invention has particular relevance, although not 
exclusively, to rotary kilns used to manufacture uranium 
dioxide powder suitable for subsequent conversion to 
nuclear fuel pellets. In one known type of rotary kiln 
(cf. FR-A-2 310 315) 
uranium hexafluoride 
vapour is fed with steam into an inlet end of the kiln. 
Reaction between the uranium hexafluoride and steam 
produces a solid intermediate product in the form of 
uranyl fluoride which passes into a heated rotating barrel 
by the aid of a scroll feed device. As the uranyl 
fluoride progresses along the barrel it reacts with a 
counterflowing stream of hydrogen and steam. This reduces 
the uranyl fluoride to a uranium dioxide powder which is 
discharged from the outlet end of the kiln. Off gases produced by reactions in the kiln flow 
towards the inlet end and pass into a filter hopper 
arranged above the scroll feed device. Mounted on the top 
of the hopper are several filter assemblies which are used 
to extract solid particles from the reaction gases. In use, a major portion of the uranyl fluoride 
particles circulate within the inlet region for a period 
of time during which particle can grow and agglomorate in 
a dendritic manner. Eventually, the particles become 
disentrained from the reaction gases and fall into the 
scroll feed device which transfers them into the kiln 
barrel. We have found that the filter hopper can be reduced in 
height by use of the construction hereinafter described 
without adverse effect on the product quality and reaction 
in the inlet region. It is an object of this 
invention to provide a rotary kiln having an improved 
inlet region.  
 According to one aspect of the invention there is 
provided a rotary kiln for producing a solid material from 
gaseous reactants, said kiln having an inlet arrangement, 
an outlet arrangement and a rotatable barrel extending 
between the inlet and outlet arrangements, means for 
introducing gaseous reactants into said inlet arrangement, 
said reactants reacting together to form a solid product, 
wherein the inlet arrangement includes a rotatable scroll 
feed device for feeding the solid product into the barrel, 
and a filter for separating particles from gases produced 
in the kiln, the filter being arranged so as to at least 
partially encircle the scroll feed device and located 
adjacent thereto. Preferably, the scroll feed device comprises a number 
of helical
