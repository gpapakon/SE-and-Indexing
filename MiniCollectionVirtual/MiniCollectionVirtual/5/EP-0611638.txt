<ABSTRACT>
A process capable of improving dimensional stability 
and surface properties of a lignocellulosic material is 

disclosed which comprises holding a lignocellulosic material (W) 
between hot platens (1a,1b) in a sealed condition, and heating 

the lignocellulosic material to vaporize moisture contained in 
the lignocellulosic material per se; thereby effecting high-pressure 

steam (V) treatment of the lignocellulosic material. In 
the treatment, the lignocellulosic material may be maintained 

in a compressed condition, or an external high-pressure 
steam (V) may be supplied from the surfaces of the hot 

platens toward the lignocellulosic material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
stabilizing a lignocellulosic material and a device therefor.
In particular, it relates to a process for stabilizing a
lignocellulosic material which is capable of improving
dimensional stability or surface properties of a
lignocellulosic material to obtain a lignocellulosic material
suitable for use in construction or furniture production, and a
device therefor.In recent years, hardwoods of good quality have been
on the decrease and sufficient supply of hardwoods has
not been attained, and accordingly attention has been
given to coniferous woods, medium duty fiber-boards
(MDFs), particle boards and the like as alternative
materials to hardwoods.However, coniferous woods are generally softer than
hardwood and have problems in surface properties such as
surface hardness and resistance to surface abrasion,
resistance to moisture and resistance to heat,
mechanical strength and the like when used as materials
for construction or furniture. On the other hand,
swelling in the thickness direction is a large problem 
to MDFs and particle boards.Accordingly, with respect to coniferous woods, a
technique is known which comprises boiling or steaming a
coniferous wood to effect softening, and then hot-pressing
the resulting coniferous wood by means of a
compression machine with flat platens to compress and
densify (hereinafter referred to as compaction) to a
thickness of about 20 to 70% of the original thickness
(Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No.126202/1992).
When a coniferous wood is compacted, remarkable effects
are obtained in the above-mentioned surface properties,
resistances, mechanical strength and the like. Upon
exposure to moisture and/or heat, however, force urging
the compacted coniferous wood to return to its original
state is caused by the action of moisture and/or heat,
and as a result, the coniferous wood which has been
copmacted on purpose to improve performance is adversely
restored substantially to the original state.In order to prevent the above-mentioned restitution
of a compacted coniferous wood and the swelling in the
thickness direction of MDF or a particle board, it has
been attempted to apply chemical treatment such as
acetylation or formallation to a lignocellulosic material
("Mokuzai Kogaku Jiten" published on May 20, 1982 by
Kogyo Shuppan K.K., pp.6 and 595). However, this method
has drawbacks that use of a large amount of chemicals is 
undesired from an environmental viewpoint, that it is
difficult to effect uniform treatment
