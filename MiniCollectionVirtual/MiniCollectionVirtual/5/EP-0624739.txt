Change-speed gearbox with an input and output 
shaft arranged coaxially and a parallel layshaft, with a 

constant mesh gear formed by a gear stage and used as the 
drive connection between the input shaft and the 

layshaft, and with a plurality of gear stages which are 
arranged as drive connections between the layshaft and 

the output shaft and can each be selected optionally and 
in conjunction with the constant mesh gear to form non-geometrically 

graduated gear ratios, characterized in 
that, in the case of use as a single-range gearbox (18), 

the constant mesh gear (11) has a smaller ratio than the 
constant mesh gear (12) in the case of use as a multi-speed 

gearbox (19), in which the constant mesh gear (12) 
can be selected optionally with a splitter group (20), 

formed by a gear stage, as the drive connection between 
the input shaft (8) and the layshaft (10), and in that, 

as members of a gearbox series, identical gear stages (13 
to 17) are used as the drive connection between the 

layshaft (10) and the output shaft (9) for the single-range 
gearbox (18), on the one hand, and for the multi-speed 

gearbox (19), on the other, and in that, in the 
multi-speed gearbox (19) designed as a member of the 

gearbox series, the quotient of the transmission ratio of 
the constant mesh gear (12) and the transmission ratio of 

the splitter group (20) is at least approximately equal 
to the square root of the ratio jump between the two 

highest gears (IX and XI) each formed without the 
splitter group (20).
