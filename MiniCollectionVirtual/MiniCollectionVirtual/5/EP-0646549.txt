<ABSTRACT>
Process for treating wastewater and/or water from 
industrial uses with flocculants constituted by at least 

one nitrate and/or basic nitrate of a trivalent metal, 
wherein the water thus clarified is then at least partially 

reused after a biological denitrification treatment, with 
great savings in consumption.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for treating 
water from industrial uses with flocculants consisting of 
at least one nitrate and/or basic nitrate of a trivalent 
metal, such as iron, aluminum or chromium, so that the 
water thus clarified is then preferably reused in a closed 
circuit after an appropriate biological denitrification 
treatment. It is known that the use of flocculants is often necessary 
in the treatment of industrial wastewater. Organic and 
inorganic products, such as polyelectrolytes and iron and 
aluminum salts, often in combination with each other, are 
furthermore known to be suitable for the purpose. Among the products used as inorganic flocculants, ferric 
chloride, ferric sulfate, ferric chlorosulfate, aluminum 
sulfate and aluminum hydroxychlorides, also known as 
polyaluminum chlorides (PAC), are preferably employed. 
However, when using these inorganic flocculants it is 
practically impossible to fully or otherwise significantly 
recycle the wastewater, as would be convenient to avoid 
excessive use of water, especially in regions and seasons 
in which it is a scarcely available resource. Total or partial recycling cannot be performed because the 
anion of the salt used as flocculant accumulates in the 
recycled water and can compromise the correct operation of 
the process and/or cause corrosion and/or deposits on  
 
equipment. Surprisingly, it has now been discovered that iron, 
chromium or aluminum nitrates or their corresponding basic 
nitrates have an excellent performance as flocculants; 
furthermore, their use does not entail the drawback of the 
accumulation of the anion in process water, since the 
nitrate anion can be easily biodegraded in appropriate 
biological plants. Furthermore, the advantage of the 
invention is that it is possible, when necessary, to 
discharge the treated water into the surrounding 
environment without its harming. The present invention therefore relates to a process for 
treating wastewater from industrial uses with flocculants 
consisting of at least one compound representeted by the 
following formula (I):

Me₂(OH)x(NO₃)y   (I)


 
where 
Meis Al, Fe(III) or Cr(III); xis a numeral between 0 and 5; yis a numeral between 1 and 6;  
and the sum 
x + y = 6  
;
 
characterized in that the clarified wastewater, which 
contains the nitrate ions deriving from the flocculant, to 
be reused at least partially, is subjected to a biological 
denitrification treatment by using a denitrifying anoxic 
sludge that can denitrify in the absence
