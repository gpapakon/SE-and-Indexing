<ABSTRACT>
A universal folding condenser (1) has a mounting plate (4) secured to the microscope and provided with a right-angled arm (4'). A fixed lens (5) is arranged in the mounting plate (4). A first right-angled swivelling arm (7) with a condenser head and a lens member (2) which can be selectively inserted into the path (11) of the lighting  beam is arranged above the mounting plate (4). A second right-angled swivelling arm (8) with a second lens member (3) is arranged below the mount (4). Both swivelling arms (7, 8) are coupled in a constrained manner by a switching linkage (6) so that when low magnification objectives are used both lens members (2, 3) are inserted into the path (11) of the lighting beam and when high magnification objectives are used only the condenser head is inserted into the path (11) of the lighting beam.

Universal folding condenser (1) for microscope instruments with a 
stationary lens member (5) arranged in a carrier plate (4) and further 

lens members (2, 3), which are switchable in and out above and below 
this lens member (5) into its optical axis (10), for change in 

aperture and illuminated field, characterised thereby, that 

a) the carrier plate (4) displays an arm (4') bent through 90Â°, 
b) two rotary bearings (12, 12'), which lie one above the other and 
stand perpendicularly to the optical axis (10), are arranged at the 

arm (4'), 
c) two pivot arms (7, 8), which are bent at a right angle, are 
provided, in the one limb of each of which the lens members (2, 3), 

which are to be switched, are fastened and the respective other limb 
of each of which is inserted into a respective one of the rotary 

bearings (12, 12'), wherein 
d) the limbs, which are borne to be rotatable, are coupled together for 
the transmission of a pivotal movement. 
Universal folding condenser according to claim 1, characterised 
thereby, that 


a) the rotary bearing (12') nearer to the carrier plate (4) is directed 
towards the optical axis (10) and the pivot arm (8), which is 

inserted into this rotary bearing (12'), is arranged by its limb 
carrying the lens member (3), which is to be switched, to be 

underneath the lens (5), 
b) the further rotary bearing (12) is directed away from the optical 
axis (10) and the pviot arm (7), which is inserted into this rotary 

bearing (12), is arranged by its limb carrying the lens member (2), 
which is to be switched, to be above the lens (5), 
c) a pin (13)-and-slot(14) coupling, which reaches through the arm 
(4'), is provided between the pivot arm (7) and the pivot arm (8). 
Universal folding condenser according to claim 2, characterised 
thereby, that a lens member (2) and a condenser head (9), which lie one 

beside the other in pivotal direction, are inserted in such a manner 
at that limb of the pivot arm (7), which is arranged above the lens 

(5), that in one pivotal setting of the arms (7, 8), the condenser head 
(9) on its own and, in the other pivotal setting, the lens members (2, 

3) together are switched into the optical axis (10). 
Universal folding condenser according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised thereby, that an elongate hole (22), which limits 

the pivotal setting of the pivot arms (7, 8), is provided at the arm 
(4'). 
Universal folding condenser according to claim 2, characterised 
thereby, that a turret disc (15), which is borne to be rotatable and 

for the reception of several light rings (16), prisms (17) and the 
like, which are selectably introducible into the optical axis (10), is 

arranged on the carrier plate (4) and the pivot arm (7) engages over 
the turret disc (15).
