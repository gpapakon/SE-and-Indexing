<ABSTRACT>
The method for cleaning pipes, in particular installed pipelines (49, 31) envisages that an abrasive medium is passed through a pipe to be cleaned with at least one liquid and one gaseous fluid. The gaseous fluid is in this case present in excess. The acceleration of the mixture can take place by high and/or low pressure. As a result of the use of a liquid, a more protective cleaning can be achieved in contrast to known dry methods. The cleaned pipe is blown dry and subsequently coated with a plastic. The coating takes place by sucking in a synthetic resin plug.

Method for renovating pipes of a pipeline system
having several connecting points wherein to remove

deposits an abrasive agent is wetted with a liquid fluid
and the fluid/abrasive agent mixture is fluidized through

a gaseous fluid and accelerated and passed through the
pipeline system which is to be cleaned characterised in

that first the pipeline system is filled with fluid, then
the wetted abrasive agent is added or forced in dosed

amount into a mixer pipe (21) where further fluid is
supplied to the mixture and that the pipeline system

filled with fluid between two connecting points is cleaned
in sectors or sections respectively.
Method according to claim 1 characterised in that the
abrasive agent/fluid mixture is passed through the pipe or

pipes at a rate of approximately 1m/s to 10 m/s.
Method according to claim 1 or 2 characterised in
that the abrasive agent, the liquid fluid and the gaseous

fluid are biased with approximately the same pressure
which lies between 2.0265 and 12.159 x 105 Pa (2 and 12

bar), preferably between 4.053 and 8,106 x 105 Pa (4 and 8
bar).
Method according to one of claims 1 to 3
characterised in that the pressure is applied

intermittently.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 4
characterised in that the pressure is adjusted so that the

mixture of abrasive agent, liquid and gaseous fluid
pulsates in the pipe. 
Method according to one of claims 1 to 5
characterised in that the running direction of the mixture

during the cleaning process is reversed at least once.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 6
characterised in that the abrasive agent, the liquid and

the gaseous fluid is passed through the pipe by applying
excess pressure and/or a vacuum.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 7
characterised in that the added abrasive agent and / or

the fluid is moved in circuit and used repeatedly.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 8
characterised in that the cleaned pipe is blow-dried and

then coated with plastics.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 9
characterised in that the coating is provided by using a

vacuum to suck through a synthetic resin plug.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 10
characterised in that the cleaned pipe is provided with a

second plastics coating after the first layer has already
polymerised at least in part.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 11
characterised in that the abrasive mixture is comprised of


1 part by volume abrasive agent
1 to 12 parts by volume, preferably 3 to 7 parts by
volume, of a liquid fluid and
80 to 3000 parts by volume, preferably 600 to 1200 parts
by volume of a gaseous fluid (at normal pressure),

wherein the mixture of abrasive agent, liquid and gaseous
fluid is sent through the pipe to be cleaned by applying

excess pressure and/or vacuum. 
Method according to claim 12 characterised in that
the liquid fluid is water and the gaseous fluid is air.
Method according to one of claims 12 or 13
characterised in that the mixture can have particle sizes

of up to approximately 10 mm, preferably up to
approximately 6 mm.
Method according to one of claims 12 to 14
characterised in that a binding agent is mixed in with the

mixture.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 15
characterised in that supply and return lines (22,51) are

each connected alternately to adjoining water connecting
points (47) of the pipeline system (31) and that cleaning

takes place of each pipe section lying between two
adjoining connecting points (10/ last section and ...).
Method according to one of claims 1 to 16
characterised in that the supply and return lines (22, 51)

are each connected blockwise to the cleaning device and
that the running direction of the cleaning composition is

reversed by changing the supply and return lines (22, 51)
blockwise (9/2nd section).
Device for renovating pipes with a container (13) for
holding an abrasive agent, a mixer pipe (21) which is

connected to the container (13) through a shut-off member
which is formed as a dosing device or dosing valve (32)

wherein the mixer pipe is attachable to at least one pipe
which is to be cleaned, with a pump (43), at least one

supply line (20) provided on the container (13) for
feeding in a liquid fluid, a supply line (17) provided on

the mixer pipe for feeding in a gaseous fluid and with
pressure means connected to this supply line (17) for 

accelerating the gaseous fluid, characterised by a further
supply line (19) provided on the mixer pipe (21) for

feeding in a liquid fluid wherein the pipe to be cleaned
is part of a pipeline system having a number of connecting

points.
Device according to claim 18 characterised in that a
separator (33) as well as supply and return lines (22, 51)

are provided wherein the supply lines (22) serve to supply
the cleaning composition to the water connecting points

(47) and the return lines (51) serve to return the
cleaning composition from the water connecting points (47)

into the separator (33).
Device according to claim 19 characterised in that
the separator (33) is connected through a first line (41)

having a pump (43) to the lines (19) and/or (20) for the
liquid fluid, and through a second line having a valve

(35) to the container (13) and that the return lines are
connected to the separator (33) and the supply lines (22)

are connected to the mixer pipe.
Device according to claim 19 or 20 characterised by a
distributor battery (53) on the mixer pipe (21) and a
