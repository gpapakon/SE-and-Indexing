<ABSTRACT>
The cylinder head of an internal combustion engine has three inlet valves on one side of a longitudinal central plane (L) and two outlet valves on the other side. The inlet valves are arranged in a circumferential direction of a cylinder of the internal combustion engine and a first inlet valve which is arranged near to the edge of a combustion space is permanently driven by a cam shaft with intermediate connection of a space-saving actuation lever (22). The other inlet valves are connected into the circuit successively or simultaneously depending on requirements. A fuel-saving change of charge can be achieved under low load by the first inlet valve being subjected to a tangential inflow whilst under increased load requirement and optimised throughput of gas over the valves connected into the circuit is possible.

A cylinder head for an internal-combustion engine, with a first group of gas-exchange 
valves arranged on one side of a median longitudinal plane of the cylinder head and a 

second group arranged on the other side of the said plane, with a first and second camshaft 
associated with the said groups, wherein at least one gas-exchange valve of the first 

group is actuated by the first camshaft with the interposition of an actuating lever and at 
least the first group is arranged along a peripheral direction of a cylinder of the internal-combustion 

engine, 
characterized in that
 the first group of gas-exchange valves is 
formed by three inlet valves (12, 13, 14), the actuating lever (22) is associated with the 

first inlet valve (12) in the peripheral direction, the said first inlet valve (12) being 
continuously actuated by the first camshaft (19), the remaining valves of this group are 

periodically actuable, and these valves and the gas-exchange valves (15, 16) of the 
second group are actuated with the interposition of flat tappets (23). 
A cylinder head according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 each gas-exchange valve of 
the first group is arranged in a separate gas-exchange duct of the cylinder head (1), and 

two pipe sockets associated with the ducts are arranged on an outer wall (26) of the cylinder 
head (1), wherein a first pipe socket is connected exclusively to the gas-exchange 

duct of the first gas-exchange valve. 
A cylinder head according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the first group is formed by 
inlet valves (12, 13, 14), the gas-exchange ducts of which are constructed as inlet ducts 

(3, 4, 5), wherein the first inlet duct (3) comprising the first inlet valve (12) is connected 
to a pipe socket constructed as a first intake pipe (7). 
A cylinder head according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that
 the second and third inlet 
ducts (4 and 5) associated with the second and third inlet valves (13 and 14) are connected 

to a pipe socket constructed as a second intake pipe (7). 
A cylinder head according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that
 an opening (31) connecting 
a combustion chamber (8) to a cavity (30) arranged centra
lly in the cylinder head (1) and 
intersected by the median longitudinal plane (
L
) is arranged adjacent to the inlet ducts (3, 
4, 5) opening into the said combustion chamber (8). 
A cylinder head according to Claim 5, 
characterized in that
 an ignition device is  
 

inserted into the opening (31), and the intake pipes (7) are provided with a device for 
supplying fuel. 
A cylinder head according to Claim 5, 
characterized in that
 a device for supplying fuel 
is inserted into the opening (31). 
A cylinder head according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the remaining valves of the 
first group are turned off and on in synchronism. 
A cylinder head according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the remaining valves of the 
first group are turned off and on in a staggered manner. 
A cylinder head according to Claim 8 or 9, 
characterized in that
 at least one gas-exchange 
valve - constructed as a first exhaust valve (15) - of the second group is actuated 

continuously by the second camshaft. 
A cylinder head according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 all the gas-exchange valves 
are constructed as disc valves, the diameter (
D
) of the disc of the first valve being smaller 
than that of the remaining valve or valves of this group. 
A cylinder head according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the median longitudinal 
axes (33, 34, 35) of the valves of the first group intersect a combustion-chamber head 

(36) in such a way that the resulting points of intersection (37) all lie on one side of the 
median longitudinal plane (
L
) and are at a respectively different distance (
A1, A2, A3
) 
from the said plane (
L
). 
A cylinder head according to Claim 12, 
characterized in that
 the median longitudinal 
axes (33) of the first gas-exchange valve and of a peripherally adjacent valve of this 

group are arranged so as to extend parallel to each other. 
A cylinder head according to Claim 13, 
characterized in that
 the median longitudinal 
axis (33) of the first gas-exchange valve forms an angle (38) with the median longitudinal 

plane (
L
), which is smaller than the corresponding angle (39) of the median longitudinal 
axis (35) of a peripherally spaced valve of this group.
