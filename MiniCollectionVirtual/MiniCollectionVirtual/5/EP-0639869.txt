<ABSTRACT>
A crimped terminal (or splice) has a housing (10) 
including a barrel (11) receiving an insert sleeve (13). The 

barrel (11) has a lug (12) received in a complementary notch 
(14) formed in the insert sleeve (13), thereby 

circumferentially keying the insert sleeve (13) to the barrel 

(11), preventing relative rotation therebetween, and 
reinforcing the housing (10) during the crimping process. 

This eliminates cracking of the housing (10) during crimping 
while improving heat dissipation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sealed corrosion-proof 
crimped terminal (or splice) for aluminum or copper wire, and 
more particularly, to a terminal (or splice) having a 
perforated insert sleeve for facilitating the crimping process 
and improving the product resulting therefrom. Sealed terminals and splices are a type of connector used 
especially for terminating discrete aluminum and copper lead 
wires. These connectors terminate stranded aluminum and 
copper wire using a "dry crimp" process which eliminates the 
need for an inhibitor agent to break down oxides which form on 
the aluminum and copper wire strands. The dry crimp technique 
results in a sealed connection, thereby preventing 
re-oxidation and corrosion after crimping. A complete line of such high-quality copper sealed 
terminals and splices is supplied by AMP Incorporated of 
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, U.S.A., under the registered 
trademark COPALUM®. U.S. Patent No. 3,955,044 discloses an insert sleeve 
positioned within the barrel portion of the terminal, and the 
strands of wire (such as aluminum wire) are received within 
the insert sleeve. The insert sleeve is formed from a 
material which has a hardness equal to or greater than that of 
the wire. Moreover, the insert sleeve is a split cylindrical 
sleeve which is perforated. During the crimping process, the 
aluminum or copper wire extrudes through the perforations in 
the insert sleeve, thereby breaking down the aluminum or 
copper oxide film on the wire strands, increasing the surface 
contact areas, and facilitating good electrical contact with 
the terminal. While perfectly satisfactory for the purposes intended, 
nevertheless, in some limited applications the insert sleeve 
may tend to rotate prior to crimping due to twisting of the  
 
wire and, as a result, this may cause cracking of the terminal 
during the crimping process. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to 
improve upon the prior art and, more specifically, to 
substantially reduce (if not eliminate altogether) the 
occasional cracking of the terminal during the crimping 
process due to the tendency of the insert sleeve to rotate and 
become mislocated under certain circumstances. The present invention finds particular utility in a 
crimped connector assembly (either for terminating an end of a 
wire or splicing the respective ends of two wires) wherein a 
housing has a hollow barrel provided with an open end, wherein 
an insert sleeve is received within the barrel, wherein the 
wire is

<CLAIMS>
A crimping assembly for a wire, wherein a housing 
(10) has a hollow barrel (11) provided with an open end (17), 

an insert sleeve (13) is received within the barrel (11), the 
wire (7) is received through the open end (17) of the barrel 

(11) and within the insert sleeve (13), and the housing (10) 
is crimped over the insert sleeve (13) and the wire, thereby 

retaining the wire (7), characterized in that 
   said barrel (11) includes a protruding lug (12), and the 

insert sleeve (13) has a notch (14) receiving the protruding 
lug (12) on the barrel, thereby circumferentially keying the 

insert sleeve (13) to the barrel and preventing relative 
rotation therebetween. 
The assembly of claim 1, wherein the housing (10) 
further has an interior wall (16) adjacent to the barrel (11), 

the insert sleeve (13) abutting against the interior wall 
(16), and wherein the lug (12) protrudes from the interior 

wall (16) of the housing (10), in the direction of the open 
end (17) thereof. 
The assembly of claim 1, further including a tapered 
insertion ring (20) within the barrel (11) for guiding the 

wire (7) therein, and the barrel (11) having an internal 
annular indentation (21) rearwardly of the tapered insertion 

ring (20) and substantially adjacent thereto, thereby 
retaining the tapered insertion ring (20). 
The assembly of claim 3, wherein the tapered 
insertion ring (20) is formed from a plastic material. 
The assembly of claim 1, wherein the insert sleeve 
(13) is perforated. 
The assembly of claim 1, wherein the crimped 
assembly comprises a terminal for a single wire (7). 
The assembly of claim 1, wherein the crimped 
assembly comprises a splice between respective wires (7). 
The assembly of claim 1, wherein the wire (7) has a 
plurality of strands, and wherein a removable funnel (22) is 

inserted through the open end (17) of the barrel (11) of the 
 

housing (10), thereby facilitating insertion of the wire (7) 

strands into the barrel (11). 
The assembly of claim 8, wherein the funnel (22) has 
a forward nipple (23) received in the barrel (11). 
The assembly of claim 9, wherein the funnel (22) is 
split longitudinally to facilitate removal of the funnel 

following insertion of the wire (7) into the barrel (11) and 
prior to the crimping operation.
