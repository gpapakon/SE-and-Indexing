<ABSTRACT>
The device has a conveyor band (2), on which an entry column (6) of products (8) is delivered. A deflecting device (10) has a driving wheel (16) and deflecting wheel (28). A belt (32) is guided over these. The belt (32) has a deflecting portion (42), in which a tab (60) reaches as far as the surface of the band (2), and a passage portion (44), where the lower edge of the belt (32) is spaced from the band (2). When the front edge (56) of the tab (60) is near the wheel (16), the biscuits (8) pass through under the belt (32) to one exit column (12). If they are to pass into the other column (14), the belt (32) is rotated by half a revolution. A high capacity and switching performance, along with a careful treatment of the products, is achieved by means of a device.

Apparatus for dividing up flat, disc-shaped 
products, in particular biscuits or pieces of chocolate, 

between a plurality of outlet columns (12, 14) from a 
continuously supplied inlet column (6), comprising: 


a conveying means (2) for transporting the products 
(8); 
an endless deflecting means (32) which is guided, 
around return elements (16, 28), above the conveying 

means (2) and, over a deflecting section (42), 
projects to a point immediately above the top side 

(4) of the conveying means (2) and, over a through-passage 
section (44), is spaced apart from said top 

side (4) by a distance which is greater than the 
thickness of the products (8), a deflecting region 

of the deflecting means (32) running in an inclined 
manner with respect to the conveying direction (A) 

of the conveying means (2), and the deflecting 
section (42) having a protrusion (60) which is 

connected fixedly to the deflecting means (32) and 
projects beyond the bottom edge (48) of the through-passage 

section (44); 
a motor (20) for driving the deflecting means (32); 
and 
a control device (50) for controlling the motor 
(20). 
Apparatus according to Claim 1, the deflecting 
means (32) having only a single deflecting section (42) 

and only a single through-passage section (44), and the 
length of the deflecting section preferably being  

 
approximately equal to the length of the through-passage 

section. 
Apparatus according to Claim 1 or 2, the return 
elements being formed by a drive wheel (16), connected to 

the motor (20), and by a return wheel (28). 
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1-3, the 
deflecting region of the deflecting means (32) being 

inclined by 7° to 20° with respect to the conveying 
direction (A) of the conveying means (2), and it being 

possible for this angle to be set preferably by a pivoting 
action around an axis (22) of the upstream return 

element (16). 
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1-4, the 
deflecting means being a belt (32) and consisting preferably 

of polyamide. 
Apparatus according to Claim 5, the belt (32) 
having lateral-guidance means (34), the latter being 

spaced apart from the bottom belt border (46, 48). 
Apparatus according to Claim 5 or 6, the belt 
(32) being designed as a toothed belt, and, in the region 

of the deflecting section (42), the teeth (38) of the 
toothed belt acting preferably as stiffening means. 
Apparatus as claimed in Claims 1-7, there being 
arranged adjacent to the upstream return element (16) a 

first sensor (52) which is intended for detecting the 
interspaces between the products (8) and is connected to 

the control device (50) in order to control the motor 
(20). 
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1-8, there 
being arranged along the periphery of the deflecting 

means (32) a second sensor (54), which senses the transition 
from the deflecting section (42) to the through-passage 

section (44) in order, via the control device 
(50), to stop the motor (20) in a predetermined position 

of the deflecting means (32). 
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1-9, a 
supporting element (62) being provided in the deflecting 

region for the purpose of supporting the deflecting means 
(32) in the vertical and horizontal directions.  

 
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1-10, a 
plurality of deflecting means (32) being arranged one 

behind the other.
