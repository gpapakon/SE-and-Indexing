<ABSTRACT>
An alkene stream which contains a corresponding alkane as an impurity or a 
propylene stream which contains alkane as an impurity is subjected to 

adsorption at a temperature of 50 to 200째C in a purifier A utilising an adsorbent 
which selectively adsorbs the alkene, thereby adsorbing substantially all of the 

alkene. The purified alkene is subjected to partial oxidation in a reactor B the 
presence of oxygen and, optionally ammonia or chlorine to produce various 

partial oxidation products. The process is operated on a low per pass 
conversion with recycle of unreacted alkene. In the system of the invention the 

purifier A may be upstream of the partial oxidation reactor B (i.e. receives all the 
fresh hydrocarbon feed to the process) or downstream of the reactor B (i.e. the 

reactor B receives the fresh hydrocarbon feed to the process). The alkane and 
alkene may both either contain three carbon atoms, the alkene being propylene, 

or two carbon atoms.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a process for producing partial oxidation 
products by the reaction of ethylene or propylene and an oxygen-containing 
gas 
in the presence of a suitable catalyst, and more particularly to a vapour phase 
process in which a hydrocarbon partial oxidation product is produced by 
contacting an ethylene stream or a propylene stream containing propane as an 
impurity with an oxygen-containing gas in the presence of an appropriate 
oxidation catalyst. Certain partial oxidation products are produced commercially by the oxidation of 
ethylene or propylene in the vapour phase over a suitable catalyst. For example, 
ethylene oxide and vinyl chloride are produced by the partial oxidation of 
ethylene with oxygen in the presence of selected catalysts, and acrylonitrile, 
propylene oxide and acrolein are produced by the partial oxidation of propylene 
with oxygen in the presence of selected catalysts. Air is generally used as the 
source of oxygen, because of its low cost and ready availability. The reaction 
can be carried out in any suitable reactor and it produces the desired partial 
oxidation product and generally carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and water as 
byproducts. The reaction conversion is usually less than 100%; accordingly the 
reactor effluent also generally contains unreacted ethylene or propylene. 
Furthermore, industrial grade ethylene and propylene usually contains small 
amounts, for example up to about 10% by volume, ethane and propane, 
respectively. Therefore, since ethane and propane is not generally affected by 
ethylene and propylene partial oxidation catalysts, the effluent usually contains 
ethane or propane. In addition to these components the effluent will contain 
nitrogen and argon if air is used as oxidant.  In the past it was common to practice the above-described partial oxidation 
processes on a single-pass basis, with the conversion of hydrocarbon to the 
desired product being maximized. This resulted in low overall efficiency, since 
the selectivity to the desired partial oxidation product is below the maximum at 
high conversion. Consequently, the concentration of carbon oxides in the 
reactor effluent was high. The effluent stream was usually incinerated, so that 
the only return realized from the effluent was heat value from combustion of the 
hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide. Later improvements included recycling part of the gaseous effluent to the 
reactor after recovery of the desired partial oxidation reaction product(s). This 
made it
