<ABSTRACT>
A floor treating machine, in particular a floor grinder (1), has on its underside at least one working plate (9) which rotates in operation. The working plate (9) is connected in a rotationally fixed manner to a retaining part (14) which is arranged coaxially above it, is supported with at least part of the machine weight on the working plate (9) and is driven by the machine motor (7). The retaining part (14) is supported on the working plate (9) in the region of the centre of rotation, the working plate (9) being pivotable in the manner of a ball joint in accordance with possible unevennesses of the floor (2). Furthermore, the working plate (9) is located radially outside the supporting point (19) opposite the retaining part (14) at a distance permitting the pivoting of the working plate (9) and is fixed in suspended fashion to the retaining part (14) at a plurality of fixing points (21) distributed around the central supporting point (19), each having axial movement play.

Floor finishing machine for the surface treatment of floors, 
in particular floor grinding machine, with at least one machining 

disc located at the bottom of the machine coaxial with a holding 
part in which a rotary movement can be induced by a motor, the 

holding part being supported at a central support point with at 
least part of the machine weight on the machining disc via a 

support surface on the holding part and a support surface on the 
machining disc with a swivelling, ball joint-type support of the 

machining disc and the machining disc being located opposite the 
holding part at a distance therefrom radially outside the support 

point and suspended with axial play but non-rotatably from the 
holding part at several mounting points distributed around the 

support point, characterized in that one (33) of the support surfaces 
(33, 34) is flat while the other (34) of the support surfaces 

(33, 34) is crowned, one (33) of the support surfaces (33, 
34) being a moulded body made of a rubber-like resilient material. 
Floor finishing machine according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the crowned support surface (34) is located on the machining 

disc (9) and the flat support surface (33) is located on 
the holding part (14). 
Floor finishing machine according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the resilient moulded body (37) is located on the 

holding part (14). 
Floor finishing machine according to any of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the resilient moulded body (37) is tied 

into the part (14) which carries it. 
Floor finishing machine according to any of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the moulded body (37) has the shape of a  

 
truncated cone and is installed in a corresponding truncated cone 

shaped mounting recess (38) of the part (14) which carries it, 
the truncated cone shape tapering towards the outside. 
Floor finishing machine according to any of Claims 1 to 5, 
wherein each mounting point is provided with a retaining bolt 

projecting from one of the parts for the non-rotatable suspension 
of the machining disc from the holding part, said retaining bolt 

having a narrowed section passing through a bearing bore in the 
other part between two axially acting stop surfaces, the bearing 

bore being shorter than the narrowed bolt section and having a 
smaller diameter than the stop surfaces, characterized in that 

the bearing bore (26) is formed in a bearing body (27) made of 
a rubber-like resilient material and mounted on the other part 

(holding part 14). 
Floor finishing machine according to Claim 6, characterized 
in that the bearing body (27) is located on the ho
lding part 
(14). 
Floor finishing machine according to Claim 6 or 7, characterized 
in that the bearing body (27) has the shape of a truncated 

cone and is installed in a corresponding truncated cone shaped 
mounting recess (29) of the holding part (14) or the machining 

disc respectively, the truncated cone shape tapering towards the 
outside. 
Floor finishing machine according to any of Claims 6 to 8, 
characterized in that the retaining bolts (22) have a threaded 

section (30) screwed into the machining disc (9) or the holding 
part respectively at the end opposite the narrowed section (25) 

and a polygonal section (31) for the application of a tightening 
tool located in the space between the holding part (14) and the 

machining disc (9) between the narrowed section (25) and the 
threaded section (30).
