<DESCRIPTION>
This is a Continuation-In-Part of Application 
Serial No. 646,785. This invention relates to a method of treating 
various diseases that respond beneficially to increases in 
extracellular levels of adenosine. This invention was made with Government support 
under Grant Nos. AM-13622; RR-00827; and HL-17682 with the 
National Institutes of Health and the University of 
California. The Government has cerntain rights in this 
invention. Adenosine belongs to the class of biochemicals 
termed purine nucleosides and is a key biochemical cell 
regulatory molecule, as described by Fox and Kelly in the 
Annual Reviews of Biochemistry, Vol. 47, p. 635, 1978, that 
interacts with a wide variety of cell types, and is 
responsible for a myriad of biological effects. For 
instance, adenosine is a potent vasodilator, inhibitor of 
immune cell function, activator of mast cell degranulation, 
an inhibitor of granulocyte activation, and a putative 
inhibitory neurotransmitter. Considering adenosine's broad 
spectrum of biological activity, considerable effort has 
been, and continues to be aimed at establishing practical 
therapeutic uses for the molecule, and its analogs.  Since adenosine or similar purine nucleosides are 
thought to act at the level of the cell plasma membrane, by 
binding to receptors anchored in the membrane, past work has 
focused on increasing the extracellular levels of the 
molecules. Unfortunately, adenosine or its analogs are 
toxic at concentrations that have to be administered to a 
patient to maintain an efficacious extracellular therapeutic 
level, thus the administration of adenosine alone is of 
little therapeutic use. Consequently other ways of 
maintaining high local extracellular levels of adenosine 
have been sought. The three most used are: a) interference 
with the uptake of adenosine with reagents that specifically 
block adenosine transport as described by Paterson et al., 
in the AnnalsoftheNewYorkAcademyofSciences, Vol. 255, 
p. 402, 1975; b) prevention of the metabolism of adenosine 
which, in turn, makes cellular adenosine available for 
extracellular transport and use outside the cell as 
described by Carson and Seegmiller in TheJournalofClinicalInvestigation, 
Vol. 57, p. 274, 1976; and c) the 
use of analogs of adenosine constructed to bind to adenosine 
cell plasma membrane receptors with lower dissociation 
constants than adenosine. There exists a large repertoire of chemicals that 
inhibit the cellular uptake of adenosine. Some do so 
specifically, and are essentially
