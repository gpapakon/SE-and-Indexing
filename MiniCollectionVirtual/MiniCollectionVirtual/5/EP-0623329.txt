<ABSTRACT>
Method for fitting a bicanalicular tube in the lacrymal canaliculi according to the Busse method. According to the invention, the hollow cylindrical canula which is closed at its end (3) with an oblong slot (2) being formed in the vicinity of the end (3), is characterised in that a slit (5) allows passage of a narrow part (7) of a guide wire (6) in order to free the canula from the wire.

A device for putting a bicanalicular ophthalmological
probe in place, comprising a silicone tube (9) constituting

the probe proper, and an intubation cannula exhibiting
a hollow cylindrical body (1) closed in the front part (3)

of it but having in the side an opening (2) of a smaller
outer diameter than the outer diameter (9) of the silicone

tube, the cylindrical body (1) exhibiting a longitudinal
slit (5) extending from the opening (2) back to the rear

end of the body (1), characterized in that the silicone tube
(9) is equipped at each end with a guide-wire (6) of a diameter

less than the inner diameter of the hollow cylindrical
body (1) and than the width of the opening (2), whilst a

zone (7) constricted to a diameter slightly less than the
width of the slit (5) is formed in the guide-wire (6) in

the vicinity of its junction (8) with the tube (9), over
a length substantially equal to the length of the slit (5).
