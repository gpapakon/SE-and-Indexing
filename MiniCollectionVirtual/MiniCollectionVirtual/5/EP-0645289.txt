<ABSTRACT>
The invention described above discloses a novel pressure limiting valve with a novel check (nonreturn) valve (2, 5), permitting return flow between the supply pressure and the secondary pressure in the air-brake system for rail vehicles. With the valve seal according to the invention in the pressure limiting valve (1), it is possible to achieve a high level of leaktightness in the shut-off direction, even in the case of very small pressure differences.

<CLAIMS>
Pressure-limiting valve (1) having a valve tube (7)
which has an integrated non-return valve with a sealing

ring (2), characterised in that

the valve seat is stepped,
the stepped valve seat (5) has two annular channel
edges (4) passing round the casing surface of the valve

tube (7) which penetrate the material of the sealing
ring (2),
the sealing ring (2) is convexly curved in the region
of its support on the annular channel edges (4); and
the spacing (h) between the two annular channel edges
(4) corresponds to the value


≤d*1/2*√2

in which d is double the radius of curvature of the
convex support surface of the sealing ring (2).
Pressure-limiting valve according to claim 1,
characterised in that the cross-section of the sealing

ring (2) is round.
Pressure-limiting valve according to claim 1,
characterised in that the sealing ring (2) rests on the

annular channel edges (4) with elastic pre-stressing.
Pressure-limiting valve according to claim 1,
charact
erised in that the valve seat has two steps, the
second step of which forms the annular channel edges

(4).
Pressure-limiting valve according to claim 1,
characterised in that the annular channel edges (4) are

broken.
