<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to compressing gas flowing 
through a conduit. The gas can be an inert gas or an oxidant or a 
combustible gas such as natural gas. A suitable application of the present invention is downhole 
compression of natural gas; this is done to enhance the production 
from an underground natural gas reservoir. Natural gas is produced 
from an underground reservoir containing natural gas through a 
tubing arranged in a well drilled to the reservoir. During production, 
the cumulative amount of natural gas produced increases and 
consequently the reservoir pressure will decrease. As a result of 
the decrease in reservoir pressure the production rate decreases 
and, in order to maintain the production rate at an economically 
acceptable level the gas has to be compressed, suitably the compression 
is done downhole. This compression also results in an 
increased economic cumulative production. An alternative application of the present invention is compression 
of a gas flowing through a pipeline to increase the rate 
of gas transported through the pipeline. USA patent specification No. 2 899 287 discloses an apparatus 
for compressing combustible gas comprising a conduit provided with 
a non-return inlet valve arranged at the upstream inlet end of the 
conduit, a localized ignition source arranged in the conduit 
downstream of the non-return inlet valve, and means for supplying 
continuously fuel into the conduit between the non-return inlet 
valve and the localized ignition source. The known apparatus is an apparatus for partially combusting 
fuel to generate a combustible gas. During normal operation, (a) 
fuel is supplied continuously into the conduit to oxidant which has 
entered in the conduit through the non-return inlet valve; (b) the 
combustible mixture is allowed to ignite, which ignition yields a  
 
high pressure wave front closing the non-return inlet valve and 
pushing gas out of the outlet end of the conduit and a low pressure 
wave front; and (c) the non-return inlet valve is allowed to open on 
arrival of the low pressure wave front to allow oxidant to enter 
into the conduit. Thereafter operation continues with the steps (a) 
through (c). In the known method the interval between two successive 
combustions is determined by the geometry of the conduit which may 
not always have the most suitable form for an optimal interval. The 
pressure increase for the compression stage of the known apparatus 
is very small, the pressure at the outlet end of the conduit is 
about 2
