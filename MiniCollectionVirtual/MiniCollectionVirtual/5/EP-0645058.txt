<ABSTRACT>
The description relates to a voltage regulator (12) to control the output voltage (UB+) of a generator (10) driven by an internal combustion engine, which also has a circuit (24) which evaluates the exciting current pulse duty factor (T) and supplies a signal (S1) at its output which is hight when the exciting current pulse duty factor is high and low when it is low. The circuit (24) is integrated into the voltage regulator (12), the output signal (S1) is supplied by it via an additional regulator terminal (DA) and can be taken to the control device (25) of the internal combustion engine and used there, for example, to increase the idling speed of the engine and thus increase the generator speed and hence the output of the generator (10). It is also possible to use this signal to switch off unnecessary users.

Voltage regulator for controlling the output
voltage of a generator, which is driven by an internal

combustion engine and supplies a variable load with
electric power, having a field winding which is connected

in series with a switching means and through which a
portion of the generator output current flows, the

switching means being switched on or off in such a way
that an essentially constant generator output voltage is

set independently of loads on the generator, having a
circuit (24) present in the voltage regulator (12), which

detects the field current pulse duty factor (T) and forms
it into a signal (S1) which assumes a first state when

the field current pulse duty factor (T) is above a first
prescribable value, and assumes a second state when the

field current pulse duty factor (T) is below a second
prescribable value, characterized in that the signal (S1)

can be tapped via a terminal (DA) at the voltage
regulator (12), and in that the tapped signal (S1) is fed

to the control device (25) of the internal combustion
engine and is used by the latter to control the speed (n)

of the internal combustion engine in such a way that the
idling speed is increased as a function of the signal

(S1) and the circuit operates only when the speed of the
internal combustion engine is below a prescribable value,

the speed level being determined by the control device
(25) an
d the latter supplying the circuit (24) with
corresponding drive pulses.
Voltage regulator according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the circuit (24) comprises at least 

one integrator (28) whose output signal influences the
output state of a downstream output stage (29).
Voltage regulator according to Claim 2,
characterized in that a pulse shaping stage (27) is

additionally arranged upstream of the integrator (28).
Voltage regulator according to Claim 2 or 3,
characterized in that the output signal of the output

stage (29) is amplified.
Voltage regulator according to one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that a Schmitt trigger

with an adjustable switching hysteresis is used as
threshold value stage.
Voltage regulator according to Claim 5,
characterized in that the actuating shafts of the Schmitt

trigger are set as a function of the field current pulse
duty factor, and the upper threshold is in the region of

T = 95%, and the lower threshold is in the region of T
= 75%.
