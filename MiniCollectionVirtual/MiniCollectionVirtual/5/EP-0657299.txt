<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed herein is an ink-jet printing method by 
ejecting an ink from an orifice of a printing head in 

accordance with a printing signal to conduct printing on a 
printing material, comprising using an ink having a pH 

value (pH

half of the absorbance at the pH in the stable region of 

the ink on an absorbance curve according to a pH change 
and a printing material comprising a base material and a 

coating layer provided thereon having a surface pH value 
of pH

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink-jet printing
method which is capable of reproducing a designed color of
ink on a printing material and permits the provision of
images high in quality, and a method of producing a print.An ink-jet printing method is a recording method in
which recording is conducted by generating and flying
droplets of an ink by one of various ink ejection systems,
for example, an electrostatic attraction system, a system
using a piezoelectric element to give an ink mechanical
vibration or change, or a system in which an ink is heated
to form bubbles in the ink, thereby using the pressure
thus produced, and applying the droplets in whole or in
part to a printing material such as paper or a plastic
film coated with an ink-receiving layer. The ink-jet
printing method attracts attention as a printing method
which scarcely produces noise and can conduct high-speed
printing and color printing.As inks for ink-jet printing, inks comprising water
as a principal component are mainly used from the
viewpoint of safety, recordability, etc. Polyhydric 
alcohols and/or the like are often added to such inks with
a view toward preventing clogging of orifice and improving
ejection stability.Besides, water-soluble dyes represented by direct
dyes, acid dyes, basic dyes, reactive dyes and food colors
are used as dyes for the inks to be used. Further, dyes
of the type that a carboxyl group is contained in their
molecules have recently come to be used for the purpose of
improving the water fastness of an image formed on a
printing medium.As recording materials suitable for use in ink-jet
printing, there have hitherto been used printing paper as
described in Japanese Patent Publication No. 3-26665,
which comprises a base paper web and a coating layer
provided thereon containing finely powdered silica and a
water-soluble binder such as polyvinyl alcohol, glossy
paper as described in Japanese Patent Publication No. 3-25352,
which comprises a cast-coated paper web and a film
formed thereon containing polyvinyl alcohol having a
saponification degree of from 50 to 90 mole % and a
crosslinking agent, and a recording sheet for an over-head
projector (OHP) as described in Japanese Patent
Application Laid-Open No. 60-220750, which comprises a
polyester film and a hydrophilic film provided thereon
composed of water-soluble polyvinyl alcohol having a
saponification degree of from 70 to 90 mole %. With the recent improvement in performance of ink-jet
printing apparatus, such as speeding up of printing
