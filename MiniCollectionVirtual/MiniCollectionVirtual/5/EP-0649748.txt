<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a thermal head for ink-jet 
printers or thermal printers, which has an array of heat 

generating zones (20) on a substrate (10) having an insulating 
surface (10a). Each heat generating zone is defined between 

two opposite electrodes (12,12') which are formed by patterning a 
conductor film deposited on the insulating surface (10a) of 

the substrate. That is, in the heat generating zones (20) 
the conductor film is absent. A patterned resistor (14) 

film, which is an anodically oxidizable film such as 
tantalum film, covers the electrodes and the insulating 

surface in the heat generating zones, and a surface 
layer of the resistor film is anodically oxidized to 

provide a protective layer (16). In this thermal head the 
anodic oxidation of the resistor film can be performed 

under optimal conditions since the conductor film is 
entirely covered with the resistor film. Therefore the 

thermal head becomes very good in durability, and it is 
possible to greatly reduce the thickness of the 

unoxidized part of the resistor film to thereby enhance 
responsiveness and reduce power consumption.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a thermal head for ink-jet
printers or thermal printers including thermal
transfer printers.Thermal printers and ink-jet printers are largely
used as output devices for computers and wordprocessors.Most of conventional thermal printers use a thermal
head having an array of heat generating zones formed on
an insulated substrate by thin-film techniques. The
heat generating zones can be energized selectively
individually to print dots in selected patterns. Each
heat generating zone is defined between two opposite
electrodes formed by patterning a conductor film, and a
resistor film exists in each heat generating zone. The
electrodes and the resistor film are covered with a
protective layer. Heat generated in each heating zone
is transferred to a thermographic paper or a heat-sensitive
ribbon which makes contact with the protective
layer above the heat generating zone. Many of
conventional ink-jet printers also use a thermal head of
fundamentally the same construction. In ink-jet
printers the thermal head is placed in the ink, and each
heat generating zone of the thermal head heats a
fraction of the ink to boil and produce a bubble which
causes a droplet of the ink to spout from a nozzle or
orifice above the heat generating zone.For example, JP 61-260604 A shows a thermal head
for thermal printers. The thermal head is produced by
the steps of depositing a resistor film such as a
tantalum film on an insulated substrate, depositing a
conductor film such as an aluminum or copper film on the 
resistor film, patterning the conductor film so as to
form two opposite electrodes for each heat generating
zone and expose the resistor film in each heat
generating zone, anodically oxidising the surface of the
resistor film in each heat generating zone and finally
forming a protective layer such as an oxide or nitride
layer on both the electrodes and the anodically oxidized
resistor surface. In this thermal head the conductor
film, resistor film and the protective layer are formed
by sputtering methods. That is, the fabrication of the
thermal head entails three different sputtering
operations. Since sputtering operations are costly due
to the expensiveness of sputtering apparatus and
targets, the thermal head is relatively high in
production cost.It is possible to use the thermal head construction
shown in JP 61-260604 A in ink-jet printers. However,
in this case it is important that the protective layer
should surely shield the underlying electrodes from the
ink. Since the protective layer
