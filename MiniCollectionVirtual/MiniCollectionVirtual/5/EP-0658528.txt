<CLAIMS>
Fibre-free, thermally insulating composite
sheet encompassing a moulded sheet comprising a highly

porous inorganic material and having a face side which
has at least one recess into which has been embedded a

fibre-free insulating layer which essentially comprises
microporous inorganic material, characterized in that

the surface of the insulating layer has been coated,
where the coating is composed of an inorganic film or

of a heat-resistant foil.
Composite sheet according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the insulating layer completely

fills the space defined by the recess.
Composite sheet according to one of Claims 1 or
2, characterized in that the outer edges of the moulded

sheet which are located on that face side of the
composite sheet which preferably faces towards the heat

source have been provided with a profiled shape.
Composite sheet according to one of Claims 1 to
3, characterized in that the highly porous inorganic

material has been selected from the class consisting of
expanded phyllosilicates or from the class consisting

of highly porous volcanic rocks.
Composite sheet according to Claim 4,
characterized in that the highly porous inorganic

material is expanded vermiculite.
Composite sheet according to one of Claims 1 to
5, characterized in that the fibre-free microporous 

insulating layer essentially consists of finely divided
metal oxide and, if desired, comprises opacifiers

and/or a curable binder.
Use of the composite sheet according to one of
Claims 1 to 6 as a high-temperature thermal insulation

material.
Use of the composite sheet according to Claim 7
in devices for heat storage.
Use of the composite sheet according to Claim 7
in high-temperature fuel cells and in high-temperature

batteries.
