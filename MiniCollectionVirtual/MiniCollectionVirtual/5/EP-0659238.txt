<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a furniture assembly system in which the most important components are knot binding rods (1) and plates (2), especially plates made of derived timber material. The knot binding rods (1) are used to secure the plates (2) together. They preferably take the form of a solid square-section aluminium rod. Near both its faces, each knot binding rod (1) has two threaded through-holes. Each hole runs perpendicularly to two opposite parallel long sides of the binding rod and passes through its longitudinal axis (6). The two frontal apertures can take a special screw (3). The plates (2) are fitted with ordinary commercial attachments (4) into which the downwardly directed screws (3) of the binding rod (1) can be secured by being pushed from the side and subsequently locking the attachment (4).
