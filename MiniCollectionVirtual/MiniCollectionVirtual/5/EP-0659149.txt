<ABSTRACT>
A tie-type security seal having a seal body (1) with internal locking teeth (5) in a tunnel (2) and an elongate element (11) having a series of sealing formations (14) therealong. The free end (13) of the elongate element (11) may be passed through the tunnel (2) so that the sealing formations (14) successively cooperate with the teeth (5) on tightening the loop so formed. According to the invention, a locking accessory (9) integral with the seal body (1) is formed with a through opening (15) having a shape substantially identical to the cross section of the elongate element (11) and at least one flexible edge part (16) to adjust itself to the differences in the said cross section in the regions of the regions of the sealing formations. The accessory (9) is foldable with respect to the seal body (1) so that the through opening (15) is superimposed on the open outlet (4) of the tunnel (2) in the seal body. When the seal is closed, the accessory (9) together with the body (cross section) of the elongate element (11) totally blocks the outlet of the tunnel (2), preventing attempts at violation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a security seal and 
more particularly to a seal of the type known as "pull-tight". 
This type of seal has a seal body defining a tunnel having 
first and second open ends and being formed internally with at 
least one locking tooth. An element to be locked in the tunnel 
comprises a flexible elongate element having a free end, the 
elongate element having a series of sealing formations along 
its length so that, on insertion of the free end through the 
first end of the tunnel and on it being pulled through the 
second end of the tunnel, the sealing portions cooperate with 
the sealing tooth in a manner similar to a ratchet. This prevents 
withdrawal of the elongate element through the first end 
of the tunnel. Security seals of the aforementioned type are widely 
used - often as ties - in spite of the reduced degree of security 
they offer. It will therefore be understood that the introduction 
of a needle or the like into that side of the 
tunnel from which the free end of the elongate element 
protrudes permits - sometimes with great facility - the unlocking 
of the inner locking teeth from the formations or 
teeth on the elongate element, thus permitting the slow, but 
progressive withdrawal of the elongate element from the seal 
body. Furthermore, the formations or teeth on the elongate 
element are relatively aggressive to the touch and this is  
 
prejudicial to those whose work involves the application of 
large daily amounts of this type of seal. A seal of this type is known that has a considerably 
improved degree of security due to the specific configuration 
of the flexible elongate part, whereby the sealing formations 
comprise stepped depressions along the elongate element the 
surface of which adjacent the depressions is substantially 
smooth and without sharp corners or edges. This results in a 
smoother - less aggressive - touch for the hands of the user. A seal with this improvement is disclosed in 
Brazilian patent application PI 8906110 of December 01, 1989, 
the degree of security being further improved due to the fact 
that, at the second end of the tunnel in the seal body, there 
is a pair of flexible tabs aligned with the locking teeth, 
which serve together with the section of the elongate part to 
close the second end of the tunnel, this making it difficult 
to introduce needles or the like during an unauthorised attempt 
to open the seal. Forming the seal body with the inner 
locking teeth and also with the protecting tabs, however, 
makes the

<CLAIMS>
Security seal comprising a seal body (1) defining a 
tunnel (2) having first and second open ends (3, 4) and being formed 

internally with at least one locking tooth (5), and a flexible 
elongate element (11) having a free end (13), the elongate element having 

a series of sealing formations along its length so that, 
on insertion of the free end (13) through the said first (3) end of the 

tunnel and on it being pulled through the second end (4) of the 
tunnel, the sealing formations cooperate with the said sealing 

tooth (5) in a manner similar to a ratchet, preventing withdrawal 
of the elongate element from the first end of the tunnel, 

characterised by comprising a locking accessory (9) integral 
with the seal body (1) and formed with a through opening (15) 

of a shape substantially identical to the cross section of the 
elongate element (11) and with at least a part (16) of its 

edge flexible to adjust itself to the differences in said 
cross section in the regions of said sealing formations, the 

accessory (9) being foldable with respect to the seal body (1) 
so that said through opening (15) in the accessory (9) becomes 

superimposed on the second open end (4) of the said tunnel (2) 
in the seal body (1). 
Security seal according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the said flexible edge part of the through opening 

(15) comprises a tab (16) which, in the folded position with 
the opening superimposed on said second end (4), is aligned 

with the locking tooth (5) in said tunnel (2). 
Security seal according to claim 1, characterised 
in that there are two locking teeth in said tunnel and two 

flexible edge parts of the through opening (15) in the form of 
tabs (16) which, in the folded position with the through opening 

(15) superimposed on said second end (4) of the tunnel 
(2), are respectively aligned with the two locking teeth (5). 
Security seal according to claim 2 or 3, 
characterised in that the sealing formations comprise stepped 

depressions (14) on the flexible elongate element (11). 
Security seal according to claim 4, characterised  
 

in that there are two parallel series of the said stepped depressions 
(14) formed along opposite sides of the elongate element, 

the outer surfaces between the two series being curved 
convexly. 
Security seal according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the said accessory (9) comprises 

a plate having a first side edge (8) connected to a 
base (6) of the said seal body (1) so that it may be folded 

over the plate to assume the configuration with the said second 
open end (4) superimposed on the through opening (15) in 

the plate (9), the plate having a second side edge (10), opposite 
the said first side edge (8) and integral with an end of 

the said elongate element (11), opposite the said free end 
(13).
