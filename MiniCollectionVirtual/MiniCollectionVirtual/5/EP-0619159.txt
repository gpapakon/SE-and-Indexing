<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method of reprofiling the wheel profile surfaces (5), composed in each case of wheel-tread surface (2) and wheel-flange surface (33), of railway wheel sets (10) by turning. The wheel sets (10) are rotationally driven about a centre axis (4). In this method, a measuring surface (8) is turned on the wheel profile surfaces, whereupon the turning tools (12), after the diameters of the measuring surfaces are measured, are adjusted as a function of this measured result and of the wear depths perpendicular to the centre axis (4) towards the centre axis in such a way that they have produced new profiles of the same diameter on the reprofiled wheel set after the reprofiling is complete. To avoid the rolling-in of chips in such machines during the machining and to avoid the dismantling of axle boxes, it is proposed that the wheel set to be reprofiled be accommodated and fixed in the dismantled state for the drive at its axle boxes (24) and that it be rotationally driven by at least one friction roller (29), the reprofiling of the new profiles being effected first of all outside the contact surfaces of friction roller/wheel and subsequently in the remaining area of the profile.

Method of reprofiling the wheel profile faces (5), composed 
in each case of tread and flange face (2,2'; 33, 33'), of 

railway wheel sets (10) driven so as to rotate round a 
centre line by machining, wherein a measuring face (8, 8') 

is produced on the wheel profile faces (5) by turning, 
whereupon the turning tools (12, 12') are adjusted towards 

the centre line (4, 4') after measurement of the diameters 
(9, 9') of the measuring faces (8, 8') as a function of 

this measured result and the depth of wear (6, 6') 
perpendicularly to the centre line (4, 4') in such a way 

that they have produced new profiles (15, 15') of equal 
diameter on the reprofiled wheel set (10) on completion of 

reprofiling, characterized in that the wheel set (10) to be 
reprofiled is held at its axle boxes (24, 24') in the 

dismantled state for the drive and is fixed and is set into 
rotation by at least one friction roller (3, 3'), the 

reprofiling of the new profiles (15, 15') initially taking 
place outside the contact faces between friction roller and 

wheel and then in the remainder of the profile. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in that the 
measuring face (8, 8') is produced in the region of the 

contact faces between friction roller and wheel. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
production of the measuring face (8, 8') is begun in the 

region of the outer end face (20) of the tread (2, 2'). 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in that the 
measuring face (8, 8') is provided on the flange camber. 
Method according to Claim 3, characterized in that 
reprofiling is begun in the region of the measuring face 

(8, 8') at the external end face (20) of the tread (2, 2').  
 
Method according to at least one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that reprofiling takes place in the region 

of the measuring face (8, 8') in the direction of the outer 
end face (20) of the wheel. 
Method according to the preamble of Claim 1, characterized 
in that the wheel set (10) to be reprofiled is held at its 

axle boxes (24, 24') in the dismantled state for the drive 
and is fixed and is set into rotation by at least one 

friction roller, wherein the turning tools (12, 12') are 
retracted after production of the measuring face (8, 8') 

and are then driven into a starting position (34) on the 
inner flange edge (35) of the flange face (33, 33'), of 

which the radial position is selected as a function of the 
depth of wear (6, 6') and of the result of measurement of 

the diameter of the measuring face (8, 8') in such a way 
that they produce new profiles (15, 15') of equal diameter
