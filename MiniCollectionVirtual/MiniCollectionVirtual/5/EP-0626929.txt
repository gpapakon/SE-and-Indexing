 TITLE OPTICALLY USEFUL COMPOSITIONS AND A SOL-GEL PROCESS FOR THEIR PRODUCTION FTELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to producing optically useful KTiOPθ4 and certain analogs thereof, including processes for producing such materials from precursor solutions. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONPotassium titanyl phosphate and certain of its analogs are non-linear optical materials, and are being investigated for a number of non-linear optical applications (see e.g., U.S. Patent No. 3,949,323). Applications range from frequency doubling the 1 μ radiation of Nd lasers to various electro-optic applications, such as modulators and Q switches. The use of these materials for forming waveguides is illustrated in U.S. Patent No. 4,740,265 and U.S. Patent No. 4,766,954. Recently, low loss optical waveguides of KTP have been developed for integrated-optic applications. Most of the above applications are based on the use of single crystal KTP.Processes for producing optical quality crystals of KTiOPθ4 (KTP) and its analogs using aqueous systems are known generally in the art as hydrother al processes (see e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,305,778) and processes for producing such crystals using nonaqueous molten salt systems are known generally in the art as flux processes (see e.g., U.S. Patent No., 4,231,838). Typically, hydrothermal processes are run at elevated temperature and pressure and involve growing the crystal in a vessel having a growth region where the crystal grows and a nutrient region containing nutrient for growing the crystal, and employ an aqueous mineralization solution. 

U.S. Patent No. 5,066,356 describes a hydrothermal process for growing optical-quality single crystals at reduced temperature and pressure conditions.U.S. Patent No. 5,039,187 discloses a process for the liquid phase epitaxial growth of a thin film of certain KTP analogs on a substrate.Sol-gel technology is well known in the art for fabricating a wide variety of glasses, fibers and films. The technique generally involves forming a solution of predetermined hydrolyzable components, at least partially hydrolyzing the components by the addition of water, then heat treating the solution to drive off the resulting alcohols, residual solvent and water to form a shaped, substantially homogeneous solid composition. Successful sol-gel processes typically offer the advantage of allowing use of relatively pure precursor materials, and selectively low temperatures, while providing a relatively homogeneous mix of components (see e.g., D. C. Bradley,
