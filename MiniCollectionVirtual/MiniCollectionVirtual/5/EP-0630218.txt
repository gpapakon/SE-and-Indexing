<ABSTRACT>
A total prosthetic hip constructed in accordance with the present invention is made up of a femoral implant (1A) and an acetabular implant (1B). The femoral implant includes a trochanteric body piece (2) which has a porous surface (22) over the portion of its exterior which is intended to be directly affixed to the natural bone. To achieve the desired bony ingrowth, pores of the porous surface are preferably sized in a range between about 250-450  mu . The exact dimensioning of the pores is known to those skilled in the art and is not particularly critical. Also included is an anchor (4) which is comprised of a permanent core (8) and a resorbable sleeve (6). Core (8) is preferably made of a metal alloy such as titanium-6-aluminum-4-vanadium. Outer resorbable sleeve (6) is formed of a biodegradable material, for example, high molecular weight poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) polymers. Other such materials include calcium hydroxyapatite, tricalcium phosphate.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of Serial
No. 07/850,891 filed March 12, 1992.The prosthetic replacement of joints has evolved over
the years from early, relatively crude models to current
prostheses which closely replicate functions and motions of a
natural joint. Some of the joints amenable to prosthetic
replacement include the shoulder, hip, knee, ankle and wrist.
Prosthetic joints have provided patients with increased
comfort, range of motion and nearly normal lifestyles.Some of the problems encountered with prosthetic
joints include excessive wear between components of the
prosthetic implants which move with respect to each other.
Additionally, movement of the implant with respect to the
patient's bone compromises fixation. A third problem is an
abnormal stress transference from the implant to the bone.To address some of the problems of fixing the implant
to the bone, cemented implants have beer developed. The cement
initially acts as a grout to "form fit" the implant to the
bone. After the cement cures to a hard material, it becomes
mechanically fixed to the bone by interdigitating into the bone
trabeculae. Cementing a plastic or metal implant securely to
natural bone has greatly improved the status of joint
replacement over the prior state of merely implanting the
component into the bone and hoping that it actually stayed
securely in place. Cement fixation generally provides
excellent short term results. However, younger, heavier, or
more active individuals may find that the bond between cement
and bone eventually breaks down. Consequently, a loosening or
separation between the bone and the implant occurs.To address the problem of cement breakage or implant
separation, an alternative is to coat a surface of the implant 
with a porous material which allows the patient's bone to grow
into the pores, thereby mechanically fixing the implant to bone
or alternatively coating the implant with a calcium-phosphate
type of ceramic which may chemically bond the implant to bone.
As a result in either case, the implant is biologically
attached to the bone. This "cementless" procedure represents
the current state of the art in implantation of joint
prostheses. The patient's own tissue eventually holds the
implant securely in place, either mechanically or chemically,
and the implant subsequently becomes a permanent part of the
bone.Another problem, seen with both cemented and
cementless implants, is occasional extensive osteolysis. This
osteolysis, or bone dissolution, occurs throughout all areas of
t

An implant for a bone joint including:

a component (1A, 36, 70, 90) defining an operative portion of the joint, the component
having an interface facing generally away from the joint and adapted to be placed into

intimate contact with an actual bone to which the component is to be fixed; and
an anchor (4, 38, 74, 92) connected to the component (A1, 36, 70,90) and adapted to
be inserted in a cavity in the bone for orienting and immovably fixing the component to

the bone immediately upon implantation, the anchor being
constructed of a high strength, permanent core (8, 46, 78, 96) and an outer layer (6,

44, 76, 94), the outer layer (6, 44, 76, 94) being
44, 76, 94), the outer layer (6, 44, 76, 94) being

securely engages the walls of the cavity in the bone and, immediately after
implantation, immovably secures the implant to the bone,

characterized in that at least part of said interface includes means promoting bony
ingrowth when the interface is in intimate contact with the natural bone, the

permanent core is shaped so that its surfaces are sufficiently spaced from walls of the
cavity after the implantation of the implant to prevent subsequent bone growth from

reaching the core, the layer is constructed
of biodegradable material so that it completely resorbs after a period of time and

thereby completely vacates the portion of the cavity occupied by it following
implantation; whereby, after the layer has resorbed, the core of the anchor is spaced

from and out of contact with the walls defining the cavity so that substantially no load
transference between the walls defining the cavity and the core can take place.
The implant according to claim 1 characterized in that the component (1A, 36, 70)
comprises a convex surface adapted to cooperate with a concave surface of another

joint member (56, 90).
The implant according to claim 1 characterized in that the outer layer (6, 44, 76, 94) is
removably connected to the core (8, 46, 78, 96) to enable the selection of the outer

layer from a supply of differently formed outer layers and thereby fit the outer layer to
the shape of the cavity.
The implant according to claim 1 characterized in that a cross sectional area of the
core (8, 46, 78, 96) is quadrilateral.
The implant according to claim 1 characterized in that the component (1A, 70, 90)
has: 


a permanent, articulating implant component having a surface to contact the bone
(22, 66, 82, 84) and a surface to interact with a cooperating surface of a joint; and

a securing means (10, 80) for joining the articulating implant component to the core.

a taper lock (10, 80).

is formed from a material selected from a group consisting of polymers of glycolic

acid, poymers of lactic acid, polyamides of Î±-amino acids, polylactic acid, polyglycolic
