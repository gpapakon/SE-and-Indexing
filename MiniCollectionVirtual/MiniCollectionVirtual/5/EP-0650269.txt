<ABSTRACT>
A communication protocol or method (40) that provides for terminal access, 
data flow, call monitoring and terminal polling, and call termination between user 

terminals (11, 12) connected to a high data rate satellite communication system. An 
"Aloha" random access channel that forms part of a bent-pipe architecture is used in 

conjunction with orderwire uplink and downlink channels to permit the system to 
cleanly and simply establish its data links and thus provide terminal access. A network 

control center (14) is used to assign a source user terminal (11) to uplink and 
downlink channels. After the communication link is established, uplinked data is 

demodulated, and routed to every downlink beam where it is multiplexed with other 
data channels, then remodulated and downlinked to every user terminal. The 

ordewire uplink is only from the network control center (14) to the satellite relay 
system, and uses the channel without demodulation and remodulation. The orderwire 

downlink is only from the satellite relay system to the user terminals (11, 12), and uses 
the channels with demodulation and remodulation. Each user terminal monitors its 

orderwire downlink channel to recognize and extract messages addressed to it. Data 
flow, call monitoring and terminal polling is performed once the source and destination 

user terminals (11, 12) have been assigned their beams and frequency and time slots. 

Thereafter, data transfer between terminals is generally independent of the network 
control center (14). Input data generated at a source user terminal (11) is multiplexed 

and transmitted to the satellite relay system. The satellite relay system demodulates 
the data, routes it so that it is retransmitted on a beam that communicates with the 

destination user terminal (12), remultiplexes and remodulates the data, and then 
transmits the multiplexed data to the destination user terminal (12). The network 

control center (14) monitors the link so that system resources are not unnecessarily 
tied up if a connection is lost. This is achieved by causing both terminals to send 

periodic messages to the network control center (14) indicating that they are active on 
the network, or the network control center (14) may periodically poll each terminal 

and terminate a call if either terminal is unresponsive or provides a signal indicating 
that it has hung up. Several call termination procedures are also provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to satellite communication systems, and
more particularly, to a communication protocol for use with a high data rate satellite
communication system that provides data, voice and video communication between
individuals.The past several decades has seen the development of communications systems
that have provided for the real-time distribution of information on a global scale. The
development of these global communication systems has evolved along several paths
that use either ground-based or satellite-based communication. Satellite-based
systems
have been employed for many years to distribute voice, data and video signals for
global broadcasting of news and sporting events, for example. With the advent of
newer high power satellite systems and technology, direct broadcast television systems
are available that provide for broadcasting of television signals from up to 100 stations
using a single satellite. Individuals install an antenna and a satellite receiver that
receives the broadcasts directly by way of the satellite and display them on a television
monitor.In order to provide for more personal communication or teleconferencing
between individuals, companies such as AT&T, for example, have developed a video
telephone system that employs a small (3-4 inch) television monitor in combination
with a conventional telephone. The video telephone system typically uses fiber optic
links to provide a sufficient bandwidth to carry the video along with the voice signals.
However, this type of system does not have enough bandwidth to provide for full
motion video. For many years multitudinous standards and protocols have been available for
placing calls, setting up connections, monitoring communication link status, and
tearing down calls on the terrestrial phone network, and also for establishing
communications over data networks, and more recently, for transmission of digitized
voice and data over a common network (ISDN). Furthermore, very small aperture
terminal (VSAT) networks, consisting of a satellite, a hub, and many small VSAT user
terminals have had the ability to transmit digital voice and data, interfacing almost
transparently with terrestrial satellite networks. In this type of network link the
satellite acts as a bit pipe, providing a network link between two terrestrial nodes, and
is a two-hopped system with a hub in the middle to route calls, or packets.In order to provide for an even more cost-effective solution to personal
telecommunication needs, the
