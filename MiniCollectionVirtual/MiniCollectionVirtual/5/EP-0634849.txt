<ABSTRACT>
Signal selection device for selecting, under 
control of a device control signal (UP-IN, DO-IN), a 

selected signal out of n digital signals (IN1, ..., IN8), 
in such a way that upon transition from one selected signal 

to another one no glitches can occur. 
The device includes a selection circuit (SC) 
composed of a plurality of sets of logic ports connected in 

cascade and comprising a decreasing number of such ports, 
and of another plurality of flipflops associated with these 

ports and triggered by the output signals thereof. The 
digital signals are applied to the ports of the first one 

of the mentioned sets. It also includes n control circuits 
(CC1, ..., CC8) to each of which a respecive digital signal 

is applied and each of which generates a third control 
signal (C1/C8) in response to a second control signal (UP-IN1, 

DO-IN1/UP-IN8, DO-IN8) obtained by clocking the device 
control signal through the selection circuit by means of 

the flipflops, and in response to fourth (UP12/UP81) and 
fifth (DO18, DO87) control signals derived from the 

respective second contol signal by a previous and a next 
control circuit respectively. The thus generated third 

control signals are also applied to the logic ports of the 
above mentioned first set to select the selected signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a signal 
selection device for selecting, under control of a device 
control signal applied to a control input thereof, a 
selected signal out of n digital signals applied to 
respective inputs of said device. Such a device is already known in the art, e.g. 
from the published European Patent Application EP-A1-0520127 
A1. Therein, the selection device is realized by a 
multiplexer circuit which selects one out of n signals 
derived from a clock signal by delaying the latter clock 
signal over predetermined time intervals. The selected 
signal is used to sample an incoming data stream from which 
the device control signal is derived by processing the 
variation in time of the middle of 0 1 0 patterns included 
therein. The latter device control signal indicates 
whether the currently selected signal is still the optimal 
one for the above sampling, or whether the signal provided 
at the next or previous input of the multiplexer has to be 
chosen. Obviously this implies that relative time 
variations between the chosen clock signal and the data 
stream never exceed the time interval between two 
consecutive delayed clock signals. Since the signal thus generated at the output of 
the multiplexer is used to sample the incoming data stream, 
this signal has to be glitchfree, i.e. it may not contain 
short additional positive pulses. Therefore the transition 
from one selected delayed clock signal to another one has 
to occur at a moment when both signals, i.e. the previously 
and currently chosen one, have the same digital value. 
Indeed, supposing that at the moment of the transition the 
previously chosen signal is low, while the currently chosen 
one is still high due to the relative delay between the 
clock signals, then the resulting output signal goes from 
low to high for a short time, i.e. until the currently 
chosen signal also becomes low, and then goes low. To  
 
avoid situations as the one just described, the relative 
position of the control signal with respect to the input 
signals at the moment the transition occurs, has to be well 
known. Due to an unknown switching delay in the 
multiplexer of the known device when switching from one 
input to another one, this position is not exactly known. 
This is especially disadvantageous when the input signals 
are high bit rate signals, because then the margin on the 
transition moment is relatively small. An object of the present invention is to provide 
a selection device of the above known type but wherein the 
abo
