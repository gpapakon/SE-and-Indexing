<ABSTRACT>
This invention enables the outer surface as a whole of a molded resin product to be covered with a coating material with 
uniform and satisfactory tension. A split mold is provided, which is capable of forming a hollow space between the tapering portions 

at the circumferential and slidable parts of upper and lower mold members thereof. A molding material is compression 
molded by using this mold, and the mold members are separated before the molded product has been completely cured, so as to 

form a space between at least one surface of the molded product and the opposed surface of a mold member. A gas flow directed 
toward the outer circumference of the mold is formed in the mold so as to send out the extraneous matter to the outside thereof 

via the mentioned space, and a fluidized coating material is injected into this space between the molded product and the opposed 
mold surface. The mold is clamped again, and the resultant product is cured under pressure.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process
and an apparatus
for forming a resin molded product including a molded body
and a molded coating according to the precharacterising part of
claim 1 and claim 9 respectively.
A process and an apparatus of this type is
known from e.g. JP-A-03-203 614.In molding the bathtub, paneling or the like made
of a thermosetting resin, it has been common to form a resin
coating on one side surface of the same, on the inner side
surface in the case of the bathtub, for example, and as a
practical process there has been a process known as an
in-mold coating process, for example. According to this
process, a pair of split molds comprising a stationary mold
and a movable mold (generally constituted by such male mold
as a lower mold and such female mold as an upper mold) are
employed, and the process comprises a step of obtaining
resin moldings of a predetermined shape with such molding
material as a bulk or sheet shaped resin molding material
(BMC, SMC etc) disposed between the split molds and
thereafter subjected to a mold clamping (compression) and a
hot pressing, and a step of coating the surface of each
molding with the fluid coating material injected between one
side surface of the resin molding and a surface of the mold,
which process is advantageous in that the molding and
coating can be carried out with the same apparatus employed
and through sequential steps. In addition to this
advantage, it is also possible to obtain a molded resin
product having the surface beautifully coated and excellent 
in the smoothness.Since in the foregoing process the molded resin
product is manufactured generally with a thermosetting
resin, the molding requires the heating along with the
compression, whereas it is also necessary that, because the
thermosetting resin is employed generally as the foregoing
coating material, the material maintains the fluidity at its
injecting step as cooled to an extent not causing the curing
to excessively advance. Accordingly, there is a problem
that temperature administration of the mold is complicated.
In injecting the fluid coating material, further, it has
been general that a mold which allows an excess body part to
be formed at part of peripheral edge of the molded resin
product is employed, and the fluid coating material is
injected through a nozzle facing the excess body part, but
there remains a problem that the coating material cannot be
distributed constantly stably and sufficiently to the
peripheral part at positions separated far from the
excessive body
