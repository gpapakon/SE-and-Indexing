<CLAIMS>
Method for the detection of a programmed or induced
cell death, wherein


a) a lysate of the cell to be examined obtained
by treatment with a non-ionic detergent is

incubated with an anti-histone antibody and an
anti-DNA antibody, wherein one of the

antibodies is bound to a solid phase before or
after this incubation and the other antibody is

a labelled antibody,
b) the solid and liquid phase are separated and
c) the label is determined in one of the two
phases as a measure of the programmed or

induced cell death.
Method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the antibody
to be immobilized is biotinylated for binding to

the solid phase and a solid phase coated with
streptavidin is used.
Use of a method as claimed in one of the claims 1
or 2 for the determination of the cytotoxic effect

or activity of cytotoxic cells, natural killer
cells, ionizing radiation or chemical compounds

such as in particular of antibodies, dioxins or
camptothecin. 
Reagent kit for the detection of a programmed cell
death which contains an anti-histone antibody as

well as an anti-DNA antibody.
Reagent kit as claimed in claim 4, wherein one of
the antibodies is present in a biotinylated form

for binding to a solid phase and the kit
additionally contains a solid phase coated with

streptavidin.
