<ABSTRACT>
A facility (305,310,315) is disposed in a telecommunication network
(200) to provide an alternative to the conventional call waiting feature. More

particularly, if a telephone call is placed to a subscriber (e.g. S1) while the
subscriber's telephone station set is busy with another telephone call, then the

facility (305) notes that fact and terminates the new telephone call after advising the
caller that the subscriber's station is busy. Thereafter, the facility (305) places a

telephone call to the subscriber (S1) and presents thereto at least the telephone
numbers of the telephone stations that placed a call to the subscriber during the time

that the latter's station was busy.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to telecommunications networks. Call waiting is a call terminating feature which provides a distinctive 
tone to alert a subscriber who is "busy" talking over the telephone to another party 
that another call is trying to reach the subscriber. At that point, the subscriber may 
either ignore the tone or press the telephone station set switch hook. The latter 
action places the party that the subscriber is talking to on hold and connects the new 
incoming call to the subscriber's station set. Thereafter, the subscriber may once 
again press the switch hook to reconnect to the party that had been placed on hold. 
This time the latter action disconnects the subscriber's station set from the new call 
and reconnects it to the party that had been placed on hold We have recognized that many telephone subscribers are annoyed at 
hearing the call waiting tone while they are busy talking on the telephone. In fact, 
up to one-third of the telephone subscribers, at one time or another, ignore the call 
waiting tone. Moreover, the party that is talking to the subscriber may become 
irritated as a result of being placed on hold. The invention in accordance with the claims. In the drawing; 
FIG. 1 is a simplified block diagram of an interexchange network in 
which the principles of the invention may be practiced; FIG. 2 is a block diagram of the adjunct of FIG. 1; FIG. 3 illustrates an example of a subscriber record that may be stored 
in the database of FIG. 2; FIG. 4 illustrates an example of one way to link a list of telephone 
numbers associated with respective telephone calls together in the database of FIG. 
2; and FIGs. 5-8 illustrate in flow chart form the program which implements 
the principles of the invention in the network of FIG. 1. In an illustrative embodiment of the invention, interexchange 
network 200, shown in FIG. 1, provides a plurality of services for its subscribers, 
such as the subscribers associated with station sets S1 through S3. Specifically, 
network 200 includes, inter alia, a plurality of interconnected Toll Switches (TS), 
three of which are shown in the FIG., namely TS 205, 210 and 215. Such toll 
switches (e.g., 205, 210 and 215) may be any one of the well-known types of 
switching equipments, such as, for example, the No. 4 ESS (Electronic Switching 
System) that is available from AT&T. In a typical case, a toll switch is associated 
with a number of local Central Offices (CO), three of which are shown in the FIG., 
namely, COs 105, 110 and 115. As is
