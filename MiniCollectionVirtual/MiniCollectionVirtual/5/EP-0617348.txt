<ABSTRACT>
Integration of engine functions and data 
communications between an aircraft propulsion 

module and an airframe is enabled by the use of 
fiber optic links which multiplex information and 

control functions without risk of an electrical 
failure in one portion of the aircraft electronics 

system propagating to other portions of the 
aircraft electronic systems.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an aircraft 
propulsion control system. A modern commercial aircraft comprises an 
airframe and two or more propulsion modules 
attached to the airframe. Each propulsion module 
includes a propulsion engine, which may be a jet 
engine having a propeller or unducted fan, a fuel 
source, and electrical generators. Each engine is 
provided with engine condition sensors and engine 
control drivers. The engine condition sensors 
generate condition signals representative of 
various parameters that characterize the operating 
condition of the engine, whereas the engine control 
drivers receive command signals relating to control 
inputs to the engine and establish the values of 
those control inputs. For example, the engine 
condition sensors might sense the temperature and 
pressure at various locations in the engine, in the 
manner described in International Publication No. 
WO 84/04829 published December 6, 1984 (Bluish et 
al), and the engine control drivers might include a 
fuel metering valve and a stability bleed valve. 
Each propulsion module also includes an engine 
electronic control unit which receives signals 
provided by the engine condition sensors and 
delivers them to the airframe, and receives command 
signals provided by the airframe and delivers them 
to selected engine control drivers. A control system as defined in the preamble of 
claim 1 is known 
from EP-A-0 267 398. Prior to the use of engine electronic control 
units, the pilot had quasi-direct control over some 
individual engine functions. For example, to issue 
a thrust command the pilot provided a bias to the  
 
fuel metering valve and aircraft devices also 
introduced a bias to the fuel metering valve as a 
means to coordinate the engine parameters and 
maintain stable engine operation. However, it was 
not a precise form of control as the amount of 
thrust actually delivered depended on altitude, 
Mach number, and temperature. To achieve the 
desired level of thrust, the pilot monitored engine 
parameters and manually readjusted the fuel command 
so that the engine parameters corresponded with a 
handbook lookup table. Currently, an engine electronic control unit 
performs the required coordination of engine 
parameters. The pilot issues a thrust command to 
the engine electronic control unit, and the control 
unit establishes the desired level of thrust 
without further pilot input. Each engine 
electronic control unit has two functionally 
identical channels, and each channel is able to 
read from
