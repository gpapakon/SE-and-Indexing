<ABSTRACT>
Novel filled curable compositions comprise a mixture and 
or a reaction product of hydroxypolyorganosiloxane, an organic 

polymer having oxyalkylene units in its molecular chain and at 
least two reactive groups - SiR

X
b
 in which R represents a 
divalent hydrocarbon group, X represents an alkoxy, alkenyloxy 

or oximo group and (b) has the value 0, 1 or 2. The compositions 
may be used as moisture curable sealants which are to 

provide an elastomeric seal having improved paintability.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with curable compositions 
and is particularly concerned with silicone based curable 
compositions useful as sealant compositions. Curable siloxane compositions have for many years 
been employed in a variety of applications. One type of 
curable siloxane composition has the ability to cure to an 
elastomer at normal ambient or slightly elevated temperatures, 
either spontaneously on mixing the components or as 
a result of exposure to moisture. Such compositions are 
generally termed room temperature vulcanisable (or RTV's) 
and they have been formulated into sealant materials having 
excellent physical properties, adhesion to substrates and 
weatherability. Commercially available silicone based 
RTV's include those derived from an organosiloxane polymer 
having silanol groups and (i) a silane having at least 3 
silicon-bonded oxime groups (such compositions are 
described for example in U.K. Patents 975 603, 990 107 and 
U.S. 3,184,427) or (ii) a silane having at least three 
alkoxy groups or (iii) a silane having at least 3 silicon-bonded 
acyloxy groups per molecule (such compositions are 
described for example in U.K. Patents 862 576, 894 758, 
920 036, U.S. 3,077,465 and U.S. 3,061,575). These 
silicone based RTV's cure readily in presence of atmospheric 
moisture at ambient temperatures and provide useful 
seals in many applications. In general, such sealant 
compositions demonstrate good resistance to degradation by 
the elements and are not readily wetted by water. Such 
properties have rendered the materials particularly suitable 
for use in the construction industry, for example in 
the sealing of horizontal or vertical joints in walls and 
masonary structures and in the sealing of glazed units to  
 
masonary. Whilst the combination of properties provided by 
such compositions is highly desirable for many applications, 
it is desirable to provide materials with an 
acceptable blend of properties at lower cost. Attempts to 
incorporate proportions of inorganic fillers or organic 
extenders have generally been restricted to the use of 
comparatively small proportions of the materials. For many sealant applications compositions which cure 
to a lower modulus are preferred. Numerous ways have been 
proposed to produce room temperature vulcanisable silicone 
based sealant compositions which cure to provide elastomeric 
seals of low modulus, for example by incorporation of 
extenders or plasticisers. Plasticisers commonly used in 
silicone based sealants include the
