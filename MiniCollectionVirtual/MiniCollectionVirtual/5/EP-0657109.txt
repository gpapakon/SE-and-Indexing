<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a brassiere. In providing adequate support for breasts it is known to provide 
reinforcement wires in brassieres which extend around the lower part of 
the cups and meet in the central region of the brassiere. However, a 
common problem with such brassieres particularly those intended for large 
busted people or those having a relatively short torso, is that the portion 
of the wires located in the central region of the brassiere are forced away 
from the body of the wearer when for example sitting and so can cause 
discomfort and be unsightly. 'Soft' brassieres are known which do not have such reinforcement 
wires and so do not suffer from the above problem. However some 'soft' 
brassieres, particularly those for ladies having a large girth it is necessary 
to provide reinforcement bones down the sides of the brassiere to help 
prevent the brassiere rolling on itself. However, the ends of such bones 
can dig into the flesh of the wearer and so can be uncomfortable to wear. It is a general aim of the present invention to provide a brassiere 
which can overcome or substantially reduce the problems referred to 
above associated with known brassieres. According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided 
a brassiere comprising a body portion for encircling the body of a wearer, 
the body portion including a pair of breast cups and associated with each 
breast cup a reinforcing wire extending along the periphery of the cup 
from adjacent an upper edge of the body defining an arm opening to 
terminate at the lower region of the cup.  Various aspects of the present invention will now be described in 
detail, by way of example, with reference to accompanying drawings, in 
which:- 
Figure 1 is a front view of a brassiere according to the present 
invention; and Figure 2 is an underside view of Figure 1. Referring to Figures 1 and 2 there is shown a brassiere 10 
comprising a body portion 11 for encircling the body of the wearer. The body portion 11 of the brassiere 10 includes a pair of suitably 
shaped breast cups 12 and associated with each breast cup 12 is a 
reinforcing wire 14. Located either side of the brassiere 10 is a side panel 
11a having a side edge 11b and upper and lower edges 22, 23 
respectively. Attached to the side edge 11b of the side panel 11a and an 
upper portion 12f of each breast cup 12 is a shoulder strap 24 forming a 
loop that together with the upper edge 22 of the body portion 11 defines 
an arm opening 16. The breast cups 12 are
