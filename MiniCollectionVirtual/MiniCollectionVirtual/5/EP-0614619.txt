<ABSTRACT>
2.1. For transporting and storing cigarettes (10), use is made of containers (11) which are open on a large-area front side and which, furthermore, have an emptying orifice (17) directed downwards. This is directed upwards before emptying. In order to guarantee a regular fault-free emptying of the container (11), with the emptying orifice (17) directed downwards, there can be introduced into the container (11) a pressure member (25) which extends over the entire length of a cigarette level (24) and which exerts a slight pressure on the cigarettes (10). An exact horizontal cigarette level (24) is thereby established. The pressure member (25) rests on the cigarettes (10) over the entire length of the latter. 2.2. To introduce the pressure member (25) into the container (11) in an upper position, the pressure member (25) is displaceable by means of a transversely movable actuating member, especially by means of a crosspiece (60).

Apparatus for the storage and conveyance of 
cigarettes (10) in conjunction with a packaging machine, 

the cigarettes (10) being stored in a container (11) 
which has an emptying orifice (17) directed downwards for 

the emptying of the container (11) by tilting, with an 
elongate pressure member (25) which, after the tilting of 

the container (11) to empty the latter, can be introduced 
to a position above a cigarette level (24), forming 

during the conveyance of the cigarettes (10) out of the 
container (11), and which rests on the cigarette level 

(24) during the emptying of the container (11), characterized 
in that 


a) a pressure piece (28) of the pressure member (25) 
can be moved to and fro by means of a transverse 

movement along a horizontal guide for entry into and 
exit from the container (11), 
b) the pressure piece (28) rests with a bearing weight 
on the cigarette level (24) and can be lowered, 

together with the latter, with the bearing weight 
being maintained, 
c) the container (11) is covered, on an open side, by 
means of a fixed cover wall (76) which has vertical 

gaps (78, 81) for the passage and lowering of the 
pressure member (25). 
Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the pressure piece (28) rests, with a pressure leg 

(30) directed transversely or horizontally, on the 
cigarettes (10), especially over the entire length of the 

cigarettes (10).  
 
Apparatus according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the pressure piece (28) has a U profile in 

cross section, with vertical walls (29, 29a) and the 
horizontally directed pressure leg (30), and in that 

lateral compensating members (84, 85) are assigned to the 
walls (29a) of the pressure piece (28), which members are 

mounted on the walls (29a) via springs (88, 89, 90, 91) 
and have slopes (99, 100) for the introduction of the 

pressure piece (28) into the container (11). 
Apparatus according to Claim 1 or one of the 
further claims, characterized in that the pressure piece 

(28) is mounted freely outside the container (11) on 
lateral vertical guides, especially slidably on vertical 

guide rods (35, 36). 
Apparatus according to Claim 1 or one of the 
further claims, characterized in that the mounting for 

the pressure member (25), especially the guide rods (35, 
36), are mounted on a stationary carrying structure, 

especially on a carrying frame (48) with vertical supports 
(49, 50) and with an upper crossmember (51). 
Apparatus according to Claim 1 or one of the 
further claims, characterized in that the horizontal 

guide, namely a crosshead (60), is mounted displaceably 
on the crossmember (51), and in that a mechanical drive 

(65), especially a cylinder (66), acts on the said 
crosshead (60). 
Apparatus according to Claim 1 or one of the 
further claims, characterized in that the cover wall (76) 

consists of lateral fixed portions (77, 78) and of at 
least one foldable middle part (79) arranged b
etween 
these, the vertical gaps (80, 81) for the passage of the 

pressure member (25) being arranged between the portions 
(77, 78) and the middle part (79) of the cover wall (76). 
Apparatus according to Claim 1 or one of the 
further claims, characterized in that the pressure member 

(25) is assigned a compensating gear, especially a 
compensating shaft (47), in order to achieve synchronism 

during the up-and-down movement of the said pressure 
member (25), and in that the pressure member (25) is  

 
indirectly or directly connected on edge regions, especially 

on lateral guide sleeves (33, 34), to a lifting 
member (37), especially to toothed-belt drives (38) which 

are arranged on both sides of the pressure member (25) 
and which are connected to one another by means of the 

compensating shaft (47). 
Apparatus according to Claim 1 or one of the 
further claims, characterized in that the bearing weight 

of the pressure member (25) on the cigarette level (24) 
can be adjusted especially by means of the dead weight of 

the pressure member (25) and, if appropriate, by means of 
additional or counterweights (26, 27).
