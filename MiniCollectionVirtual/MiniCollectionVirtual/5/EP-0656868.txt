<ABSTRACT>
A process and device are disclosed for controlling a portainer. The positions of points at an edge of the cargo handling gear or of a container received therein, as well as the position of a point at an edge located at a destination site, are measured and converted into signals for controlling the portainer drive.

Apparatus for controlling a container crane, which has a movable 
lifting device (15, 23) for a suspended loading gear 

(16, 24), with which containers (12, 120, 25, 40, 41) can be 
picked up and held, having at least one downwardly looking 

sensor (17a, b; 18a, b; 29a, b; 60) arranged on the crane, 
which is in the position to survey on edges disposed within 

its scanning region and having a minimum height drop at 
least one point of the edge, whereby the apparatus generates 

control signals for the crane drive to steer the loading gear 
(16, 24), characterised in that the sensor (17a, b; 18a, b; 

29a, b; 60) is arranged above the loading gear (16, 24) on 
the lifting device (15, 23) its scanning region being so 

directed, that points (170a, b; 170a', b'; 42, 43) on at least 
one edge (160a, b) of the loading gear (16) and/or on at least 

one upper edge of a container (25) carried in the loading gear 
(24) and, when approaching a target container (120) to be 

picked up or serving as stack basis on at least one upper edge 
(120a, b) of the target container (120) are surveyed, whereby 

the apparatus generates control signals, from the positions of 
the detected edge points (170a, b; 170a', b'; 42, 43) and 

from the known dimensions of the loading gear (16, 24) or 
of the containers (12, 120, 25, 40, 41) for the crane drive to 

steer the loading gear (16, 24) or a container connected 
thereto into an engagement position with the target container 

(120). 
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that the 
sensor sweeps over at least two selected, parallel edges of the 

loading gear or of the container carried therein. 
Apparatus as claimed in Claims 1 or 2, characterised in that 
at least two sensors (17a, b; 29a, b) are provided which scan 

respective opposed, parallel edges (160a, b) of the loading 
gear (16) or a container carried in the loading gear.  

 
Apparatus as claimed in Claims 3 or 4, characterised in that 
the two sensors (17a, b) are offset from one another in the 

direction of the edges (160a, b) to be scanned. 
Apparatus as claimed in one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised 
in that the sensor (29a, b) is arranged outside the vertical 

projection of a container (25), carried in the loading gear 
(24), on the crane. 
Apparatus as claimed in one of the preceding claims, characterised 
in that the sensor is mounted to be movable in the 

direction of the selected, scanned edge. 
Apparatus as claimed in one of the preceding claims, characterised 
in that the sensors (17a, b; 18a, b; 29a, b; 60) are 

conventional 2D distance sensors which produce a beam (60) 
rotating in a plane with constant simultaneous determination 

of the beam angle and the beam return time. 
Method for controlling a container crane, in a which loading 
gear (16, 24) for containers (12, 120, 25, 40, 41) suspended 

on a movable lifting device (15, 23) is moved back and forth 
in the empty state or loaded state between two alternating 

target points, the target locations being represented substantially 
by a target container (120) to be picked up or serving as 

stack base or a receiving surface of characteristic configuration 
and in which by means of at least one downwardly looking 

sensor (17a, b; 18a, b; 29a, b; 60) arranged on the 
crane, at least one point on edges situated within the scanning 

region of the sensor (17a, b; 18a, b; 29a, b; 60) and having 
a minimum height drop, are surveyed, whereby control 

signals are generated, from the positions of the surveyed 
points for the crane drive to steer the loading gear (16, 24) 

characterised in that the sensor (17a, b; 18a, b; 29a, b; 60) is 
arranged on the lifting device (15, 23) and that at least one 

respective point (170a, b; 170a', b'; 42, 43) on at least one  
 

selected upper edge (160a, b) of the loading gear (16) and/or 
on at least one upper edge of a container (25) carried in the 

loading gear (24) and, when approaching the target location 
(120, 28, 41) a point (170a', b'; 43) of a selected edge 

(120a, b; 30, 31) situated in the target location are surveyed, 
from the measurement results and the known dimensions of 

the loading gear (16, 24) or of a container (40) possibly 
carried therein and the known target location configuration, 

the height difference and the lateral difference between the 
loading gear (16, 24) and the target location (120, 29, 41) 

are determined and changed into control signals for the crane 
drive. 
Method as claimed in Claim 8, characterised in that the sensor 
is moved in opposition to or together with the crane in 

the direction of the selected horizontal edge of the target 
location and at least one of the two corner points of the 

selected edge is thereby surveyed and the crane is moved in 

accordance with the determined measured value parallel to 
the scanned edge so that its loading gear is movable into the 

target location without further displacement in the direction 
of the scanned edge. 
Method as claimed in one of Claims 8 or 9, characterised in 
that at least one respective point of a respective horizontal 

edge of all the surfaces situated on the path between the starting 
and target locations are surveyed by means of the sensor 

and a profile of the surface crossed by the loading gear is 
calculated and supplemented from the measured values.
