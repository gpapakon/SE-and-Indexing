<ABSTRACT>
A pressure sorter for the preparation of fibre suspensions obtained from waste paper, with a filter (38) surrounding a rotor (36), a feed chamber (54) between the rotor periphery and the filter and an accepts chamber (58) outside the filter and with section components (86a - 86d) on the peripheral surface of the rotor to generate positive and negative pressure pulses. In order to improve sorting and prolong the useful life of the filter, there is a rotor peripheral area sector in each of the axial sections of the rotor peripheral area acting on the filter between two successive section components in the direction of the rotor periphery, said sector being part of a jacket surface parallel to the feed site of the filter. Measured in the direction of the rotor periphery, the length of each section component is at least approximately the same as that of the next rotor peripheral surface sector, the length of the latter is, however, at least 30 % of the length of the section component in front of it. The section components are designed and arranged at the periphery of the rotor in such a way that, viewed in the direction of the filter axis, the rotor peripheral surface sectors form through channels between the section components along the region of the rotor surrounded by the filter.
