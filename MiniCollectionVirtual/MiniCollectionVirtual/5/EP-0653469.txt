<ABSTRACT>
The aqueous coating composition according to the invention is based on latex of a polymer derived from the polymerisation of the following monomers:     (a) acetoacetoxyethyl acrylate or acetoacetoxyethyl methacrylate;   (b) glycidyl acrylate or glycidyl methacrylate; (c) one or a number of polymerisable acids containing ethylenic unsaturation and   (d) one or more monomers copolymerisable with the above; in which the total percentage by weight of (a), (b) and (c) in the polymer latex composition is between approximately 2 % by weight and approximately 60 % by weight relative to the total quantity of solids contained in the latex and in which the total percentage by weight of (d) in the composition of the latex is between approximately 97 % by weight and approximately 40 % by weight relative to the total quantity of polymer solids contained in the latex. The aqueous compositions according to the invention can be employed especially in glues, pressure-sensitive adhesive compositions, industrial paints, decorative paints and coatings for wood.
