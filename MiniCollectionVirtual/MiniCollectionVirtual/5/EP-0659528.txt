<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
manufacturing gas generating material, and particularly to
a method of making gas generating bodies from gas
generating material.A gas generating body (known as a "grain") is used to
generate gas to inflate a vehicle occupant restraint such
as an airbag. U.S. Patent No. 4,696,705, assigned to the
assignee of the present application, discloses such a gas
generating body. The gas generating body when ignited
generates nitrogen gas to inflate an airbag. The gas
generating body preferably has a plurality of
longitudinally extending passages parallel to the axis of
the body.Upon ignition of the gas generating body, it has a
progressive rate of burn. A progressive rate of burn is
one in which the burning proceeds, for a substantial part 
of the burn cycle, at a rate which increases. As the
circumferential surfaces of the passages in the body burn,
the passages widen, exposing increasingly more surface
area to burning. Simultaneously, the outer circumference
of the body of gas generating material shrinks, reducing
the surface area exposed to burning, but this reduction in
surface area is less than the increase in surface area
produced by burning in the passages in the grain. At a
point in the burn cycle, the burn rate ceases to increase
and remains constant until near the end of the burn cycle,
at which time the rate of burn decreases to zero.
Nonetheless, the period of increasing burn rate extends
for a substantial part of the burn cycle.Typically, a body of gas generating material is
manufactured by first producing a gas generating material
in the form of a dry powder, flowing the dry powder into a
die, and applying a high pressure to the powder so that
the powder particles adhere to each other to form the
body. U.S. Patent No. 4,696,705 discloses such a process.In order to manufacture bodies of gas generating
material which have a plurality of passages to provide a
progressive rate of burn, it is necessary to have a
plurality of closely spaced pins which extend
longitudinally in a die cavity. The gas generating
material is introduced into the die cavity around the
pins. If the gas generating material does not flow
readily into the die cavity and around the pins, air 
pockets can form in the material in the die cavity. When a
high pressure is applied to the material in the die cavity,
the material may apply a lateral force against a pin. If an
air pocket is on the side of the pin opposite the direction
of action of the lateral force, the pin may break.German

<CLAIMS>
A process for forming granules of gas generating
material having a spherical configuration comprising the

steps of:

(a) preparing a wet mixture of the ingredients of the
gas generating material;
(b) comminuting the wet mixture to reduce the particle
size of at least some of said ingredients;
(c) extruding said wet mixture into a plurality of
discrete non-spherical extrudate; and
(d) forming the non-spherical extrudate into a dry
spherical configuration.
The process of claim 1 wherein the ingredients of the
gas generating material comprise a metal azide and a metal

oxide reactive with said azide.
The process of either of the preceding claims wherein
at least some of the ingredients of the wet mixture are

comminuted to an average particle diameter of less than 5
microns.
The process of any one of claims 1 to 3 wherein the
spherical granules have an average particle diameter of

about 0.5 to about 0.7 millimetres. 
The process of any one of claims 1 to 4 wherein said
comminuted wet mixture has moisture removed therefrom prior

to extrusion by centrifuging the wet mixture to reduce the
moisture content of the wet mixture to between about 7% and

about 11% by weight.
