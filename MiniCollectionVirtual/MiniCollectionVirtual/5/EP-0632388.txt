<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a processor system comprising a data bus with a fixed size of N bits (D64) connected to a memory (12) for words of n bits by a bus with a size of n bits (D16), where N is a multiple of n and where n is variable. The system comprises means (62) for, on each execution by the processor of an instruction for writing an N-bit word into the memory, successively writing each sub-word of n bits constituting this N-bit word to distinct addresses; and means (60, 64, 65, 66) for, on each execution of an instruction for reading an N-bit word from the memory, successively reading from the said memory at distinct addresses sub-words of n bits, and juxtaposing these sub-words on the bus of fixed size.

An image processing system including a
processor (10) adapted to processing pictures according

to intra, predicted and bidirectional modes in
cooperation with a memory (12) capable of storing at

least three decoded pictures and accessible through an
N-bit data bus, characterized in that it comprises, for

processing pictures only according to the intra and
predicted modes in cooperation with a half-size memory

through an N/2-bit bus:

means (62) for, at each execution by the
processor of a write instruction of one N-bit word in

the memory, successively writing each N/2-bit sub-word
constituti
ng said N-bit word;
means (60, 64, 65, 66) for, at each execution
of a read instruction of an N/bit word in the memory,

successively reading in said memory two N/2-bit sub-words,
and juxtaposing these sub-words on the N-bit bus;
an address folding circuit (52) comprising:

an addressing circuit (86) for providing the
memory with two distinct addresses for each address

provided by the processor;
an address generating circuit (80-84) for
providing an address within the address boundaries of

the memory when an address provided by the addressing
circuit is out of predetermined boundaries; and
means (92, 94) for inhibiting the decoding if
an address provided to the memory in write mode

corresponds to data which has not yet been read.
The system of claim 1, including means
(114, 102, 124) for locking each read or write 

instruction in the processor so that a same read or
write instruction is executed twice.
The system of claim 2, wherein said
locking means include means (114, 102) for inhibiting

the incrementation of an instruction pointer (110) of
the processor.
The system of claim 2, wherein said
locking means include means (124) for inhibiting the

provision of a clock signal (CK) to the processor.
The system of claim 2, including means
(86) for multiplying by 2 each address provided by the

processor and for incrementing or decrementing the
resulting address at each execution of the first of two

same read or write instructions.
The system of claim 2, including devices
(10-1) that are connected in order to receive N-bits

data on the fixed size bus (D64) through the activation
of respective enabling signals (EN), each signal being

normally activated at each execution of a read
instruction, characterized in that it includes means

(50, VAL) for authorizing the activation of said
enabling signals only during the execution of the second

of the two same read instructions.
The system of claim 2, including devices
(10-1) that are connected to write N-bits data on the N-bit

bus (D64) through the activation of respective
enabling signals (EN), each signal being normally

enabled each time a write instruction is executed,
characterized in that it includes means (50, VAL) for

authorizing the activation of said enabling signals only
during the execution of the first of two same write

instructions.
