<ABSTRACT>
A process is disclosed for operating the water-steam circuit of a thermoelectric power station, for example a steam power station, a heating or combined heating and power station, with a condensate pre-heating section (20), a steam generator (30) and a steam turbine (10) with condenser (12) and subsequent condensate preparation unit (14) arranged dowstream, with at least one condensate pump (16) upstream thereof. Steam tapped from the steam turbine (10) and/or from a steam overheating (32) is applied on the prepared condensate in the pre-heating section (20), thus heating it before it is supplied to the steam generator (30). The condensate is preprocessed before it reaches the pre-heating section (20) and need then not be degassed while it flows through the pre-heating section (20).

A process for the operation of a water-steam circuit
of a thermoelectric power station with a preheating

section (20) for condensate, with a steam generator
(30) and with a steam turbine (10) with a condenser

(12) and a downstream condensate treatment unit (14)
and with upstream condensate pumps (16), with the

treated condensate being charged in the preheating
section (20) by means of bleeder steam from the steam

turbine (10) and/or from a steam reheating unit (32)
and being heated in this way before it is supplied to

the steam generator (30), characterized in that prior
to reaching the preheating section (20) the condensate

is subjected to a pretreatment in such a way that the
treated condensate is charged with alkaline salts and

oxygen, that a degasification of the condensate is
omitted and that the condensate is supplied to the

steam generator (30) without performing any
degasification measures.
A process as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that
the condensate is stored in a condensate storage means

which is integrated in the preheating section (20).
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized in
that in the operating state of "frequency support" no

condensate is conveyed to the preheating section (20),
so that there is no steam withdrawal from the steam

turbine (10) for the purpose of heating up cold
condensate.
A water-steam circuit of a thermoelectric power
station for performing the process as claimed in one

of the claims 1 to 3 with a preheating section (20)
for condensate, with a steam generator (30) and with a 

steam turbine (10) with condenser (12) and downstream
condensate cleaning, with a charging with alkaline

salts and with oxygen occurring in the condensate
cleaning, and with at least one upstream condensate

pump (16), in which preheating section (20) there is
arranged at least one preheater (18), with at least a

first feed pump being connected upstream thereof, and
at least one further preheater (26, 28) which is

provided downstream of at least one feed pump and is
provided downstream with at least one further pump

which supplies the heated condensate to the steam
generator without any degasification measure.
A water-steam circuit as claimed in claim 4,
characterized in that the feed pump (24) is arranged

in two stages and comprises a fore-pump and a main
pump.
A water-steam circuit as claimed in claim 5,
characterized in that the fore-pump and the main pump

are spatially separated from one another and are
provided with a common drive motor.
A water-steam circuit as claimed in one of the
preceding claims 4 to 6, characterized in that a

condensate storage means (22) is integrated in the
preheating section (20) .
A water-steam circuit as claimed in claim 7,
characterized in that the condensate storage means

(22) is used as a feed for the feed pump (24).
A water-steam circuit as claimed in claim 7 or 8,
characterized in that the condensate storage means

comprises a pressure cushion. 
A water-steam circuit as claimed in claim 9,
characterized in that the pressure cushion is a steam

cushion.
A water-steam circuit as claimed in claim 9,
characterized in that the pressure cushion is a

nitrogen cushion.
