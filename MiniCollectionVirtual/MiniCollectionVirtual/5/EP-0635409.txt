<ABSTRACT>
An electronic anti-theft alarm apparatus to be 
used in conjunction with an automobile which relies on 

pressure as being the activating medium for the alarm 
apparatus. There is mounted within the passenger 

compartment of the automobile within the circuit of the 
alarm apparatus a pressure sensor. When this pressure 

sensor detects a pressure change, the alarm is 
activated. Included within this circuit and mounted 

exteriorly of the passenger compartment but yet on the 
body of the automobile is a second pressure sensor. 

When both pressure sensors detect a pressure change, 
activation of the alarm is prevented. This will 

eliminate false alarms from occurring due to an exterior 
pressure change such as when closing a garage door and 

opening a door from a house to a garage. Activation of 
the alarm apparatus is only to occur when the pressure 

sensor that is mounted within the passenger compartment 
detects a pressure change and the exterior pressure 

sensor does not so detect that change.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a combination of an automobile and an
alarm system mounted in conjunction with said automobile
where the alarm system minimizes false alarms and is only
activated where unauthorized access into the automobile
is being attempted.Electrical alarms to function as an anti-theft
device are in exceedingly common usage.
Such anti-theft alarms can be used to perform any of
various desired functions when activated. Examples of
such alarms when activated cause an annunciator to be
activated with different types of annunciators being a
siren, a horn and/or blinking lights. Also such alarms
when activated could cause the starting circuit of the
automobile to be disabled.The common type of an alarm that has been
utilized in the past uses a pressure sensor within an
electronic circuit. When this pressure sensor detects a
pressure change, even a minimal pressure change, the
circuit is activated which will result in, for example, 
the automobile horn producing noise in a series of beeps or causing the lights of the
automobile to blink on and off. This pressure sensor of the alarm is located within the
passenger compartment of the vehicle. If the alarm is set and the door of the
automobile is opened, the alarm will be activated. The alarm will also be activated if
a window is broken. Actually these pressure sensors are so sensitive that if one bangs
on the automobile window, the alarm will be activated. The banging on the window
deflects the window sufficiently so as to change the air pressure within the passenger
compartment which is detected by the pressure sensor and thereby activates the alarm.These pressure sensors have to be set to a high degree of sensitivity in order
for the alarm to function properly. However, this also means that if the entire car is
subjected to a pressure change, that this pressure change will be detected by the
pressure sensor. An exterior pressure change will generally result in an erroneous
activation of the alarm. Typical of such pressure changes that result in erroneous
activation would be when the automobile is parked within a garage and the garage door
is closed which causes a sufficient change in pressure to activate the alarm. Also, if
the automobile was parked within a garage, and the alarm was in a set mode, and a
door is opened gaining access into the garage, that would cause a sufficient change in
pressure to activate the alarm.JP-A-61/105256 discloses an automotive alarm using an internal microphone
and an external microphone to detect the noise levels

<CLAIMS>
In combination an automobile (22) having a body with a
passenger compartment; and an automobile alarm system mounted

in conjunction with said automobile, said automobile alarm
system having a first sensor (60) including a first microphone

(24) mounted within said passenger compartment, a second
sensor (64) including a second microphone (26) mounted on

said automobile and exteriorly of said passenger compartment,
an alarm circuit (36, 38, 108, 116, 156) and an annunciator

(152), said first sensor (60) and said second sensor (64) being
electrically connected through said alarm circuit (36,

38, 108, 116, 156) to said annunciator (152),
characterised in that

said first sensor (60) and said second sensor (64) include
low pass means so that said first sensor (60) and said second

sensor (64) are sensitive to air pressure changes, and in
that said alarm circuit (36, 38, 108, 116, 156) further has a

first input terminal connected to the first sensor (60), a
second input terminal connected to the second sensor (64) and

an output terminal connected to said annunciator (152),
whereby said annunciator (152) is not activated when both

said first sensor (60) and said second sensor (64) simultaneously
detect a change in air pressure, and said annunciator

(152) will be activated only when said first sensor (60) detects
a change in air pressure and said second sensor (64)

detects no change in air pressure.
The combination of an automobile and an alarm system according
to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 said second microphone
(26) is mounted within the engine compartment of said

automobile (22).
The combination of an automobile and an alarm system according
to either of claims 1 and 2, 
characterised in that

the sensitivity of the first sensor (60) is adjustable.
