<ABSTRACT>
A one-piece plastic clip, particularly for sealing bags at any location along the height of the bag or at a location adjacent the bag opening. The clip includes two mutually hinged limbs (2, 3) provided with bag engagement surfaces. The bag engagement surfaces are intended to engage bag material located therebetween, when the limbs are brought together so as to seal the bag. The free ends of the limbs are provided with a snaplock arrangement (4, 5) which can be opened manually and which locks automatically when the limbs are brought together. At least one (3) of the limbs has an elastically resilient bridge (6) which functions to press bag material sealingly against the opposing bag engagement surface, so as to seal the bag.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a bag clip and then 
particularly to a bag clip which is intended for tightly 
sealing plastic bags at any location along the height of 
the bag or at a location adjacent the bag opening. The 
clip is a single piece structure which comprises two 
limbs or bars which are pivotally joined together at 
respective one ends thereof and which have bag-engaging 
surfaces which are intended to receive therebetween that 
portion of the bag where a seal is to be effected when 
the limbs are moved together with said bag portion 
located therebetween. The other ends of the limbs have a 
manually openable snaplock which closes automatically 
when the limbs are brought together. A bag clip of this kind is known from the publication 
EP-A-O 156 779. Although this clip functions exceedingly 
well for the purpose for which it is intended, the 
construction of the clip is, nevertheless, relatively 
complicated, therewith rendering the moulding tool or 
pressing tool used to manufacture the clip relatively 
expensive. Furthermore, because of its complicated 
construction, the clip cannot be manufactured in comparatively 
small sizes, for reasons of a technical nature. 
The object of the present invention is to provide a clip 
of less complicated construction, so that the clip can 
be manufactured, as by injection moulding or extrusion 
processes, in a less expensive manner and in smaller 
dimensions than can the known clips, while maintaining 
material consumption at a relatively low level. Also known to the art is a bag sealing clip as described 
in U.S. Patent Specification 4,847,956. This known clip 
comprises two limbs which are hinged together at one end  
 
thereof, so as to clamp tight on the open end of a 
flexible bag. The other ends of the limbs are held 
together by a multi-step latch and the clip is able to 
accommodate bag materials of different thicknesses as a 
result of an expandable hinge structure. This clip 
structure, however, is highly complicated and lies 
outside the general purview of the invention. For the sake of completeness, reference can also be made 
to U.S. Patent Specification 3,805,813, which teaches an 
automatic hair clasp. This hair clasp, however, has 
little resemblance to the inventive bag clip. The novel, characteristic features of the inventive clip 
are set forth in respective characterizing clauses of 
the following Claims. The invention will now be described in more detail with 
reference to an exemplifying embodiment of an inventive 
bag clip
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A plastic clip, particularly for sealing bags at any 
location along the height of the bag or at a location 

adjacent the bag opening, said clip being a single piece 
structure which comprises two mutually hinged limbs (2, 

3) having engagement surfaces which, when the limbs (2, 
3) are brought together, operate to seal that part of 

the bag which is located between the limbs, and which 
further comprises a manually openable and automatically 

closeable snaplock arrangement (4, 5) at the free ends 
of said clip,
characterized
 in that at least one (3) of 
said limbs includes an elastically resilient bridge (6) 

having one of said engagement surfaces for engagement with that 
part of the bag at which a bag seal shall be effected. 
A clip according to Claim 1, 
characterized
 
in that the bag engagement surface of said bridge has a 

slight arcuate, convex configuration. 
A clip according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
 
in that the snaplock arrangement includes 

a locking tongue (4) which forms part of the limb (3) 
which includes the bridge (6), and a shoulder or ledge 

(5) which forms part of the other limb (2). 
A clip according to any one of Claims 1-3, 

characterized
 in that when the clip is 
closed, first the centre part and then, when further closing pressure 

is applied, the whole of said engagement surface of said bridge (6) 
obtains contact with the opposing bag engagement surface (11) on the other 

limb (2) 
A clip according to Claim 3, 
characterized
  
 

in that the elastically resilient 
bridge (6) generates a counterpressure when closing the 

clip, so that the locking shoulder (5) will be pressed 
against the operating tongue. 
A clip according to any one of Claims 1-5, 

characterized
 in that the clip is manufactured 
by injection moulding or ext
rusion processes. 
A clip according to any one of Claims 1-4, 

characterized
 in that both limbs include an 
elastically resilient bridge.
