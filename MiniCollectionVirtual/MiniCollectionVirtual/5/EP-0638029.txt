<ABSTRACT>
A protection frame for road vehicles has at least one frame (2) which laterally covers also the rear wheels (3) of a vehicle and which in the top view has the outer dimensions of the vehicle (1).The frame (2) extends from about the loading height of a high-capacity truck (5) down to approximately the lower edge of the rim.

A protective frame arrangement for road vehicles,
wherein


a) in plan view, the frame (2) exhibits the external
dimensions of the vehicle and laterally encloses at

least the rear wheels of the vehicle (1),
b) the frame (2) - made of steel or extruded light
metal sections - provides a substantial proportion

of the structural stability of the vehicle (1),
c) the frame extends from the height above the ground
of the chassis of a heavy goods vehicle (5) to

close to the bottom edge of the wheel rim,
d) the frame (2) at the front and tail is provided
with deformation elements (12) or is itself

deformable, the deformation behaviour being so
designed that considerable deformation occurs in

the upper area (10) only as a result of forces
which arise in the case of impact between two

commercial vehicles of approximately equal weight
and is effected in the middle area by forces (9)

which arise in the case of impact with private cars
(7).
A protective frame arrangement according to claim 1,
characterised in that, when viewed over its height, the

frame (2) is subdivided into different structural zones,
the lowest area (8) being constructed as a resilient

apron.
A protective frame arrangement according to claim 1 or
claim 2, characterised in that the lowest area (8) of 

the frame (2), i.e. the resilient apron (11), extends
downwards to the level of the centre of gravity of the

body of a pedestrian (F) lying in the road, preferably
therefore approximately 10 to 18 cm.
A protective frame arrangement according to any one of
the preceding claims, characterised in that the frame is

bevelled in the corner areas in order to effect a
glancing collision in the case of a frontal collision

with slight overlap.
A protective frame arrangement according to the
preceding claims, characterised in that, to achieve

reliable compatibility, a height regulation means is
provided for the frame (2).
A protective frame arrangement according to any one of
the preceding claims, characterised in that the frame

(2) is of removable construction in the area of the
wheels (3, 4).
A protective frame arrangement according to any one of
the preceding claims, characterised in that, using the

external main frame as a base, the commercial vehicle
itself is constructed as a container.
A protective frame arrangement according to any one of
the preceding claims, characterised in that the frame

area is provided with additional identifying means in
the side area.
A protective frame arrangement according to any one of
the preceding claims, characterised in that, in the case

of agricultural vehicles and construction vehicles, the
structure may be raised when off-road in order to ensure

the necessary ground clearance or the middle and/or 
lower protective frame area (9, 8) may be folded down or

up or removed.
A protective frame arrangement according to any one of
the preceding claims, characterised in that the frame

arrangement is also extended to the forked tow-bar area
of a trailer.
A protective frame arrangement according to any one of
the preceding claims, characterised in that a diagonally

mounted rod (14) in the front and/or tail area ensures
that impacting vehicles slide off when collisions occur

(Fig. 8).
A protective frame arrangement according to any one of
the preceding claims, characterised in that the

transition between the front (26) and lateral (25) frame
areas is such that they may be pressed into one another,

thereby providing energy conversion.
