<DESCRIPTION>
 DEVICE FOR MAGNETICALLY TREATING FLUIDS GASES OR SOLIDSThis invention relates to a device for magnetically treating fluids which has particular, but not exclusive, utility in the treatment of hydrocarbon fuels for use in internal combustion engines.It has previously been known to magnetically treat hydrocarbon fuels for use in internal combustion engines to promote more efficient combustion, better t efficiency and reduced emissions. These devices, however, have concentrated on < creating a magnetic field where the magnetic flux describing the field intercepts a substantial portion of the fluid flow substantially at right angles to the direction of fluid flow, or alternatively substantially parallel with the direction of fluid flow.It is an object of the present invention to provide a device for magnetically treating fluids which creates a magnetic field whereby the magnetic flux describing the field intercepts a substantial portion of the fluid flow at an oblique angle relative to the direction of fluid flow.In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a device for magnetically treating a fluid comprising a plurality of annular magnetic portions each having a central aperture arranged coaxially so as to define a central bore through which a fluid may pass, wherein said central apertures have varying diameters and said portions are disposed in sequence so that the diameter of said central bore varies axially therealong; and wherein said portions are arranged so as to provide a uniform magnetic field having poles of 

 opposite polarity disposed at opposite ends of said passage.Preferably, the annular magnetic portions comprise a permanent magnet or magnets.In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a device for magnetically treating a fluid comprising a plurality of annular magnetic portions each having a central bore arranged coaxially so as to define a central passage through which a fluid may pass, wherein said magnetic portions are disposed so as to provide a magnetic field having lines of magnetic flux which intercept said fluid within said passage substantially at an oblique •"angle relative to the direction of fluid flow.In accordance with a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a device for magnetically treating a fluid comprising a plurality of annular magnetic portions each having a central bore arranged coaxially so as to define a central passage to fit upon a cylindrical device to be entrained in said fluid,

CLAIMS
1. A device for magnetically treating a fluid comprising a plurality of annular magnetic portions each having a central bore arranged coaxially so as to define a central passage through which a fluid may pass, wherein said central bores have varying diameters and said portions are disposed in a sequence so that the diameter of said central passage varies axially therealong; and wherein said portions are arranged so as to provide a uniform magnetic field having poles of opposite polarity disposed at opposite ends of said passage.
2. A device as claimed in claim 1, wherein a said annular magnetic portion 
"
■
comprises a permanent magnet or magnets.
3. A device as claimed in claim 2, wherein a said annular magnetic portion comprises an induced magnet or magnets.
4. A device as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein said annular magnetic portions are grouped into discrete magnetic bodies each of which may comprise one or more annular magnetic portions; said magnetic bodies being characterised by magnetic portions of the same type and spacing.
5. A device as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein the central bore of a said annular magnetic portion is either of constant diameter along its entire axial extent or is of a continuously varying diameter along its entire axial extent.
6. A device as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein said plurality of annular magnetic portions comprise a series of discrete ring magnets each having poles of opposite polarity disposed adjacent to each other so as to 


 reinforce said magnetic field and being jusxtaposed so as to form an integral unit.
7. A device as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein said magnetic portions are encased within a housing of non-magnetic material to form an integral unit.
8. A device for magnetically treating a fluid comprising a plurality of annular magnetic portions each having a central bore arranged coaxially so as to define a central passage through which a fluid may pass, wherein said magnetic portions are disposed so as to provide a magnetic field having lines of
,: magnetic flux which intercept said fluid within said passage substantially at an * oblique angle relative to the direction of fluid flow.
9. A device as claimed in claim 8 wherein at least a pair of said magnetic portions are axially spaced at prescribed distance from each other along said passage.
10. A device for magnetically treating a fluid comprising a plurality of annular magnetic portions each having a central bore arranged coaxially so as to define a central passage to fit upon a cylindrical device to be entrained in said fluid, wherein said magnetic portions are disposed so as to induce a magnetic field upon said cylindrical device and in turn on said fluid thereby magnetically treating said fluid.
11. A device for magnetically treating a fluid substantially as herein described in any one of the embodiments.
