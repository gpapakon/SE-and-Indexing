<ABSTRACT>
A switch with at least two stable positions comprises a casing (30), an operating element (5) movably held in the casing (30) and indexing means (1) retained partly by the operating element (5) and partly by the casing (30). The indexing means (1) incorporate a magnetic circuit with at least one permanent magnet (2) associated with at least one counter-target (21) and a magnetic field closure target (18) located opposite the counter-target in each stable position. One of the assemblies consisting of target, counter-target and permanent magnet is mounted on the operating element (5) and the other is mounted on the casing (30). Application to motor vehicules.

Switch with at least two stable positions, notably for a motor vehicle, of the type 
having a support casing (30) carrying a movable manoeuvring member (5-50), able to 

occupy the said stable positions, and locating means (1) carried partly by the 
manoeuvring member (5-50) and partly by the casing (30) in order to define stable 

positions of the manoeuvring member (5, 50) in which the locating means (1) have a 
magnetic circuit with at least one permanent magnet (2, 3), characterised in that the said 

permanent magnet (2, 3) is integral with at least one counter-target (20, 21...) profiled 
so as to increase the field of the magnetic flux, and in that the said circuit has a target 

(11, 12, 13...) for closing the magnetic field disposed opposite the counter-target in each 
stable position, one of the target/counter-target elements with its permanent magnet 

being carried by the manoeuvring member (5-50), whilst the other one of the said 
elements is carried by the casing (30), so as to define at least two stable positions, at 

least two targets and one counter-target or vice-versa being provided for this purpose. 
Switch according to Claim 1, characterised in that, in order to reduce the power 
of the permanent magnet (2, 3), a pole piece (20, 21...) is associated with each pole of 

the said permanent magnet. 
Switch according to Claim 2, characterised in that these pole pieces (20, 21...) are 
twinned and shaped so as to form the counter-targets. 
Switch according to Claim 2, characterised in that the pole pieces (20, 21...) are 
profiled so as to increase the flux of the magnetic field. 
Switch according to Claim 4, characterised in that the pole pieces (21) have a 
plane shape with a trapezoidal-shaped free end. 
Switch according to Claim 5, characterised in that the targets (12) have a U shape 
with two legs turned towards the pole pieces (21) and a trapezoidal-shaped free end.  

 
Switch according to Claim 4, characterised in that the pole pieces (21, 22...) have 
a curved free end in order to define an air gap between the said free ends. 
Switch according to Claim 7, characterised in that the target (11) forms a lug with 
a trapezoidal-shaped free end entering between the two free ends of the pole pieces (20). 
Switch according to Claim 7, characterised in that the target (14) is bar shaped 
with a trapezoidal-shaped free end opposite the free ends of the pole pieces (22). 
Switch according to any one of Claims 1 to 9, characterised in that the permanent 
magnet (2) with its pole pieces (20, 21...) is carried by a hub (9) belonging to a handle 

(5) pivotally mounted in a casing (30). 
Switch according to any one of Claims 1 to 9, characterised in that the permanent 
magnet (2) with its pole pieces (20, 21...) is carried by the plate (42) of a casing (30), 

whilst the targets (24) are carried by a knurled wheel (50) rotatably mounted in the 
casing (30).
