<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for treating 
osteoarthritis symptoms including pain, joint 

stiffness, limitation of range of motion and 
limitation of overall function through the rise of 

subsensory unidirectional voltage pulses in the 
frequency range of 90 to 110 hertz applied to 

non-invasive conductive electrodes in contact with a 
patient's skin proximal to an arthritic joint

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an apparatus for the treatment of osteoarthritis.Osteoarthritis or osteoarthrosis is a degenerative joint disease which
commonly affects both axial and peripheral diarthrodial joints in humans. Moveover,
since the incidence of this disease increases steadily with age, it is an almost universal
occurrence in the elderly.Pathological characteristics of osteoarthritis include progressive deterioration
and loss of articular cartilage from the surfaces of joints, as well as reactive changes at
the joint margins and the underlying bone. Manifestations of the disease that are
treatable are joint pain, stiffness and limitation of motion. Synovitis or joint
inflammation is also a common secondary manifestation of the disease that is also
treatable. Although, as aforementioned, high incidence of the disease occurs in the
elderly, the treatment is highly individualized and may include: (a) prescription of a
pharmacological agent, (b) a surgical procedure, or (c) a physical modality.Conventionally, patients exhibiting symptomatic osteoarthritis are initially
treated by their physician by the administration of a nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). As indicated by
U.S. patents 4,997,850 issued to Kimura et al and
4,944,949 issued to Story et al, many such
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are known and
are frequently effective in reducing the symptoms of
osteoarthritis. That is to say, they have
demonstrated value in helping to relieve pain,
improve activity levels, and in some cases improve
function in osteoarthritic patients. Many members
of this class of drugs have been approved by the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment
of osteoarthritis.None of these drugs, however, have been proven
in carefully controlled clinical trials to reverse
the long term natural history of this degenerative
joint disease. Moreover, while many of these drugs
have demonstrated effectiveness in treating the
symptoms of osteoarthritis, they also have been
associated with significant toxicities and other
risks, such as deleterious effects on cartilage when
used over prolonged periods of time. In March of
1989, for example, the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration moved to warn both doctors and the
public about the use of such drugs which were said
to have become the No. 1 cause of complications
among all prescription drugs. Moreover, in addition
to being very expensive the toxicities of such drugs
limit their usefulness, particularly in elderly
patients.In this regard, the above noted patent

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for treating arthritic joint symptoms, said apparatus comprising:
non-invasive conductive electrode means (C) for contacting a patient's skin

proximate said joint; pulse generating means (1,2) connected to said electrode
means (C) for producing a series of voltage pulses, and means (3) for adjusting

the amplitude of the pulses to a level below the sensory level of a patient,
characterised in that said pulses are at a frequency in the range of 90-110 hertz

and are spiked negative-going unidirectional pulses.
An apparatus as in claim 1, wherein said pulse generating means includes an
oscillator means (1) and a pulse shaping means (2) connected to said oscillator

means and wherein said amplitude adjusting means comprises an attenuator
(3).
An apparatus as in claim 2, further including a capacitive output stage (5,6) for
preventing excessive voltage levels from being applied to said electrode

means.
An apparatus according to claim 2 or 3, wherein the attenuator (3) is operative
to adjust the amplitude of the pulses to a level of from zero to minus 10 volts.
