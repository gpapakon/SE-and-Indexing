<ABSTRACT>
A high foaming, nonionic surfactant based, light duty, liquid detergent with 
desirable cleansing properties and mildness to the human skin comprising three 

essential surfactants: a water soluble nonionic surfactant; supplemental amount of a 
water soluble, foaming, sulfate anionic surfactant, a lesser amount of a water soluble, 

foaming zwitterionic betaine surfactant and the balance being water.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to light duty liquid detergent compositions
with high foaming properties, containing a nonionic surfactant, an alkali metal
sulfate surfactant in a weight ratio of nonionic surfactant to sulfate
surfactant of 3:1 to 1:1 and supplemented with lesser amounts of a Zwitterionic
betaine surfactant, wherein the surfactants are dissolved in an aqueous medium.Nonionic surfactants are in general chemically inert and stable toward pH
change and are therefore well suited for mixing and formulation with other materials.
The superior performance of nonionic surfactants on the removal of oily soil is well
recognized. Nonionic surfactants are also known to be mild to human skin. However,
as a class, nonionic surfactants are known to be low or moderate foamers.
Consequently, for detergents which require copious and stable foam, the application
of nonionic surfactants is limited.The prior art is replete with light duty liquid detergent compositions containing
nonionic surfactants in combination with anionic and/or betaine surfactants. As shown
in U.S. Patent No. 3,658,985 wherein an anionic based shampoo contains a minor
amount of a fatty acid alkanolamide. U.S. Patent No. 3,769,398 discloses a betaine-based
shampoo containing minor amounts of nonionic surfactants. This patent states
that the low foaming properties of nonionic detergents renders its use in shampoo
compositions non-preferred. U.S. Patent No. 4,329,335 also discloses a shampoo
containing a betaine surfactant as the major ingredient and minor amounts of a
nonionic surfactant and of a fatty acid mono- or di-ethanolamide. U.S. Patent No.
4,259,204 discloses a shampoo comprising 0.8-20% by weight of an anionic
phosphoric acid ester and one additional surfactant which may be either anionic,
amphoteric, or nonionic. U.S. Patent No. 4,329,334 discloses an anionic-amphoteric
based shampoo containing a major amount of anionic surfactant and lesser amounts
of a betaine and nonionic surfactants. U.S. Patent No. 3,935.129 discloses a liquid cleaning composition based on
the alkali metal silicate content and containing five basic ingredients, namely, urea,
glycerin, triethanolamine, an anionic detergent and a nonionic detergent. The silicate
content determines the amount of anionic and/or nonionic detergent in the liquid
cleaning composition. However, the foaming property of these detergent
compositions is not discussed therein.U.S. Patent No. 4,129,515 discloses a heavy duty liquid detergent for
laundering fabrics comprising a mixture of
