<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a cooler based on the Stirling cycle. It comprises means (2,8,9) for generating a pressure wave in a fluid and transmitting it to a cold finger (21) of the pulse (pulsed) tube type. The cold finger (21) comprises a tubular regenerator (24) which is mounted coaxially around the pulse tube (25). Applications: Cooling, especially of electronic components such as infrared detectors.

Cooler based on the Stirling cycle, which
includes means for generating a pressure wave in a

fluid and for transmitting it to a cold finger (60) of
the pulsed-tube (66) type, comprising a tubular

regenerator (63) pneumatically connected to the pulsed
tube (66), mounted coaxially about the pulsed tube and

placed inside an external tube (62), characterized in
that the inner surface of the regenerator (63) serves

as the pulsed tube.
Cooler according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the cold finger is immersed in a cryostat, the

external tube (62) forming the inner wall of the cryostat.
Cooler according to either of Claims 1 and 2,
characterized in that the means for generating the

pressure wave and for transmitting it to the cold finger
comprise a pressure oscillator (68), a buffer

reservoir (69) and a pneumatic circuit (8) which connects
the pressure oscillator (68) and the buffer

reservoir (69) to the base of the cold finger (60).
Cooler according to Claim 3, characterized in
that the pneumatic circuit (8) includes a first duct

(81) between the pressure oscillator (68) and the
regenerator (63), a second duct (82) between the buffer

reservoir (69) and the pulsed tube (66) and a third
duct between the pressure oscillator (68) and the

pulsed tube (66). 
Cooler according to either of Claims 3 and 4,
characterized in that the pressure oscillator (68) has

a casing which serves as the buffer reservoir.
Cooler according to one of Claims 3 to 5,
characterized in that a fluid passes through a heat

exchanger (10) between the pressure oscillator (68)
and/or the buffer reservoir (69) and the pulsed tube

(66).
Cooler according to one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that the fluid passes through a cold

exchanger between the regenerator (63) and the pulsed
tube (66) at the free end of the cold finger (60).
Cooler according to one of Claims 3 to 7, in
which the pressure oscillator (51) is a resonant linear

oscillator, characterized in that a device (54) makes
it possible to modify the temperature of the fluid in

the buffer reservoir (52) and therefore its pressure so
that the cooler has an adjustable resonant frequency.
Cooler according to one of Claims 3 to 8, in
which the pressure wave undergoes a phase shift between

the pressure oscillator (68) and the cold finger (60),
characterized in that the pneumatic circuit includes

means for regulating the said phase shift.
Cooler according to Claim 9, characterized in
that the means for regulating the phase shift consist

in adjusting the length and/or the cross-section of the
ducts (81, 82, 83).
Cooler according to either of Claims 9 and 10,
characterized in that at least one of the ducts

(81, 82, 83) includes at least one element such as a
means for pinching its wall, a gauged restriction or a

valve so as to adjust the phase shift of the pressure
wave.
Cooler according to one of Claims 3 to 11,
characterized in that it includes a plurality of pressure

oscillators (70, 71, 72) mounted in parallel, a
switch (73) allowing the cold finger to be connected to

one of the pressure oscillators (71).
