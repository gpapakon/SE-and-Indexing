<ABSTRACT>
The drive device has a cam disc (18) which can be driven in a pulsed manner in a rotational direction (D) by means of an energy store in order to connect the power circuit breaker. An intermediate section (50) having a continuously reducing radius is adjacent to a first section (48) of the cam track (20) of the cam disc (18), in which first section (48) the radius increases as the azimuth angle increases counter to the rotational direction (D). This intermediate section (50) is followed by a second section (52) which runs approximately in the radial direction. As a result of the interaction of the first section (48) with the roller (22'), the triangular lever (76) is moved, together with the switching shaft (26), counter to the rotation direction (D) from the disconnected position into the connected position, and through an excess travel (U) beyond this point. When the intermediate section (50) moves past the roller (22'), the triangular lever (76) moves slowly back in the rotational direction (D) as a result of the force of the disconnection spring, which is now stressed, until its latching tab (78) rests against the connection latch (72). This slow backward movement results in the impact forces which act on the latch (34) being greatly reduced.

Drive device for a power switch, in 
particular for medium and high voltage, having a cam 

disc (18), which, for switching on the power switch 
(12), can be driven by means of an energy store (68') 

about an axis (16') in a direction of rotation (D) and 
the curve path (20) of which exhibits a first section 

(48) of radius (A), which increases as the azimuth (α) 
increases counter to the direction of rotation (D), and 

a second section (52), which follows behind the first 
section (48) in the direction of rotation (D) and runs 

roughly in the radial direction, having a follow-up 

member (22, 22'), which is forced by a disconnecting 
spring (38) in the direction of the cam disc (18) and 

which, by rotation of the cam disc (18) in the 
direction of rotation (D), by means of the first section (48) of 

the curve path (20), is moved from a switch-off setting 
(0), as the disconnecting spring (38) is simultaneously 

tensioned, into a switch-on setting (I) and by a 
measure of an overtravel (U) beyond this, and which is 

designed to be connected to a moved contact piece (30) 
of the power switch (12), and having a pawl (34) for 

the releasable supporting of the follow-up member (22, 
22') in the switch-on setting (I) after the first 

section (48) has run off from the follow-up member (22, 
22'), characterized in that the curve path (20) 

exhibits, between the, in the direction of rotation 
(D), trailing end (48') of the first section (48) and 

the second section (52), an intermediate section (50) 
of a radius (A) which becomes steadily smaller as the 

azimuth (α) increases, against which intermediate  
 

section (50) the follow-up member (22, 22') bears until 
supported against the pawl (34). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the reduction (B) in the radius (A) of the curve 

path (20) in the intermediate section (50) is larger 
than the overtravel (U). 
Device according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the intermediate section (50) 

adjoins the first section (48). 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the intermediate section (50) 

sweeps an angle (50') of 10 to 20°. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the reduction (B) in the radius 

(A) of the curve path (20) in the intermediate section 
(50) measures 0.2 to 5%, preferably 0.5 to 1.5%, of the 

difference between the largest and smallest radius 
(A
max
; A
min
) of the first section (48). 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the energy store (68') exhibits a 

connecting spring (68) connected to the one end of a 
traction element (66), which, eccentrically attached in 

an articulated manner by its other end to the axis 
(16') of the cam disc (18), is connected to the latter, 

and the trailing end (48') of the first section (48) of 
the curve path (20) interacts with the follow-up member 

(22, 22') whenever the articulated attachment of the 
traction means (66) is located at least approximately 

in the stable dead centre position (66').
