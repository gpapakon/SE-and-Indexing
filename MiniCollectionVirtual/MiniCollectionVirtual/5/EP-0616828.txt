<ABSTRACT>
An edge filter for liquid has a filter body (10) which is produced by a 
metal injection moulding process followed by a heat treatment process. 

The body which incorporates "V" section flow channels (14, 15) is then 
ground so as to establish when the filter body is in a bore, controlled 

clearances between the wall of the bore and ribs (16) defined between 
adjacent flow channels (14, 15).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to edge filters for liquids and to a method of 
making the same, the filters being of the kind comprising an elongated 
filter body which is located in a bore, an inlet and an outlet 
communicating with the opposite ends of the bore respectively, a first 
channel in the surface of the body, said first channel being open at one 
end of the body but closed at the other end thereof and a second 
channel in the surface of the body said second channel being open at 
the other end of the body but closed at the one end thereof, the surface 
of the body between said channels defining ribs, and said ribs having a 
controlled clearance with the surface of the bore whereby liquid supplied 
to said inlet will flow into one of said channels and will pass through the 
controlled clearances into the other channel to said outlet, solid 
contaminant in the liquid larger than the controlled clearances being 
retained in said one channel. Such filters are widely used in the fuel injection nozzles of a fuel system 
for an internal combustion engine in particular, compression ignition 
engines. In such fuel systems the fuel has to flow through a plurality of 
outlet orifices in a nozzle body which may be as small as 0.14mm and 
in order to ensure that the risk of blockage of the orifices is minimised, 
controlled clearances in the order of 30-45 microns have to be provided 
in the filter. Such small clearances constitute a restriction to the flow of 
fuel but the degree of restriction can be reduced by reducing the path 
length for the fuel as it flows across the ribs. The degree of restriction 
could be reduced by increasing the length of the body but such an 
approach is not possible due to the difficulty of finding room in the 
nozzle to accommodate an increased length of filter body.  The filter is located in a holder to which the nozzle body is secured and 
the aforesaid bore is part of the fuel inlet passage of the nozzle. In a 
typical example the filter body has a length of 20.0mm and a diameter of 
4.0mm. In the past the flow channels have been formed by milling flats 
or slots in a length of suitable material to form the channels, heat treating 
the milled body to achieve a desired hardness value, and grinding the 
external surfaces of the body to achieve the controlled clearances with 
the wall of the bore. If the number of flow channels is increased the 
formation of the flats or slots by machining methods becomes more 
difficult and expensive and although increasing the diameter of the

<CLAIMS>
An edge filter for liquids comprising an edge filter body (10) 
which is located in a bore (9), the filter body having a plurality of first 

channels (14) formed in its surface, the first channels being open at one 
end of the body but closed at the other end thereof, and a plurality of 

second channels (15) which are open at the other end of the body but 
closed at the one end of the body the first and second channels being 

alternatively arranged about the body, the channels between them 
defining a plurality of ribs (16) which have controlled clearances with the 

surface of the bore (9) characterised in that said channels (14, 15) are of 
"V" section throughout their length and diminish in depth from their 

open ends to their closed ends whereby the ribs (16) have substantially 
parallel side edges and are inclined relative to the axis of the body. 
An edge filter according to Claim 1, characterised in that one 
end portion (12) of the body is formed as an interference fit with the wall 

of the bore (9). 
An edge filter according to Claim 2, characterised by locating 
pads (17) at the other end portion of the body, said pads being a sliding 

fit with the wall of the bore. 
A method of making the filter body (10) of an edge filter for 
liquids, the body being of elongated form and being located in a 

cylindrical bore (9), the body having a first channel (14) formed in its 
surface, the first channel being open at one end of the body but closed at 

the other end thereof an a second channel (15) which is open at the 
 

other end of the body but closed at the one end thereof, the surface of 
the body between said channels defining ribs (16) which have controlled 

clearances (7) with the surface of the bore (9), the method comprising 
metal injection moulding the body (10) with the first and second 

channels being defined in the moulded blank, heat treating the blank to 
the desired hardness value and grinding the blank to achieve the 

required controlled clearances between the ribs (16) and the wall of the 
bore (9) in which the finished body is located. 
A method according to Claim 4, including the step of grinding 
one end portion (12) of the blank to form an interference fit with the wall 

of the bore (9). 
A method according to Claim 5, including the further step of 
grinding the other end portion of the blank to form locating pads (17) on 

the ribs (16) said pads being a sliding fit with the wall of the bore (9).
