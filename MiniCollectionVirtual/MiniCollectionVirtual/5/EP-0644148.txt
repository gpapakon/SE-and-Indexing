<ABSTRACT>
Mechanisms for changing the threads to be processed on sewing or embroidering machines, in which old and new threads are connected to one another by interlacing, have fundamentally already been proposed. In order to simplify the introduction of the new thread into the interlacing chamber, it is proposed to cause the individual threads (23) to end in the mutually adjacent eyes (40') of an eye rake (136) which is always displaceable in the transverse direction so as to bear closely against the interlacing chamber (198). After the desired thread (23) has been aligned with the interlacing chamber, the corresponding eye is loaded with compressed air guided in the desired direction of transport and the free front end of the thread is thereby shot into the interlacing chamber, the transport stage and transport speed being regulated by a transport limiter. The eye rake (136) is subsequently no longer loaded with compressed air, but the interlacing chamber is likewise loaded slightly forwards by the compressed air (199) in the feed direction of the latter, so that the interlacing does not take place in a stationary manner, but over a stage determined again by the transport limiter. Mounted rotatably in the interlacing chamber (112) is a rotor (18) which has on its outer circumference recesses (20) in the form of turbine blades.
