<ABSTRACT>
A flux for brazing aluminum based materials for a 
heat exchanger including a tube and fins. The flux 

consists of x (wt%) of KF, y (wt%) of ZnF₂, and z (wt%) 
of AlF₃. When a ternary equilibrium diagram is employed 

to show the ratios between the components of the flux by 
coordinate points (x,y,z) in the diagram, the ratios of 

the component are located inside the polygonal area 
delimited by coordinate points d(50,10,40), 

p(46,40,14), s(32,40,28), j(35,30,35), and 
h(40,10,50). Pitting corrosion of the tube as well as 

selective corrosion, at locations where the fins are 
brazed to the tube, are both prevented.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a flux used 
for brazing aluminum or an aluminum based alloy. In the production of a heat exchanger which 
includes parts such as heat exchanging pipes and fins 
made from aluminum or an aluminum alloy, brazing the heat 
exchanging pipes and the fins is usually done using a 
flux based on a fluorine compound, such as KF-AlF3, which 
is advantageous in its anti-corrosion capability. When a fluorine based flux is used for brazing 
fins onto a heat exchanging tube which is, in particular, 
made of aluminum or aluminum alloy material, the tube is 
subjected to flame spraying of a zinc material to create 
an anti-corrosion coating on the outer surface of the 
heat exchanging tube in order to prevent any pitting 
corrosion from occurring. Furthermore, the fins are made 
of a material, which is, along the galvanic series, 
located at a position which is higher in the series than 
the position of the material of the heat exchanging tube. 
In other words, the material used for the fin has a 
potential higher than that of the material used for the 
heat exchanging tube, so that a sacrificial corrosion 
effect takes place, which causes the fins to be corroded 
in place of the tube. However, even if the heat exchanging pipes, on 
which zinc material is flame sprayed, are used, it is 
difficult to ensure that a value of the potential, at the 
locations where the fins are brazed to the tube, is lower  
 
than a value of the potential at the heat exchanging 
tube. As a result, selective corrosion may occur at the 
locations where the fins are brazed to the tube. When 
the heat exchanging device is used in a very corrosive 
environment, such a selective corrosion may eventually 
cause the fins to separate from the tube. However, if a 
heat exchanging tube which was not zinc flame sprayed is 
employed, it is very difficult to prevent pitting 
corrosion from occurring at locations other than the 
locations where the fins are brazed to the tube. The Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication 
No. 61-293699 discloses a technique in which a flux based 
on KF-ZnF2 is employed to form a zinc diffusion layer on 
the surface of the aluminum based material, so that 
selective corrosion is prevented from occurring even at 
the location where the brazing is done, thereby producing 
a heat exchanger with good anti-corrosion reliability. 
This prior art is, however, defective in that the brazing 
operation in such a prior art is not very effective, when 
executed in an industrial atmospheric brazing
