<DESCRIPTION>
 TITLE CHAIN-STITCHED CARPET YARNS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the Invention The present invention relates to carpet yarns composed of multiple component yarns which have been chain-stitched together, and methods for producing such yarns. These yarns are characterized by a unique structure, where each component yarn forms a series of tightly held loops along the entire length of yarn. The invention also encompasses carpets composed of such yarns. Description of the Related ArtThe most common way for combining two or more component yarns in order to make a larger composite yarn, suitable for carpets, is by twisting them together. For example, in making yarns for saxony-type cut pile carpets, two or more bulked continuous filament yarns or staple yarns are twisted in one direction individually and then ply-twisted together in the opposite direction. The composite yarn is then heated while at low or no tension to a temperature at which the yarn strands become heat-set in the twisted condition. As a result, the yarns tend to remain twisted when they are inserted into a carpet backing and subsequently cut to form parallel vertical tufts. However, under continuous wear, the tuft tips gradually lose their twist and filaments of one tuft become entangled with those of neighboring tufts to form a matted surface appearance. Thus, a tuft tip structure which retains its integrity during wear would be greatly desired.In preparing the above-described conventional ply-twisted yarns for cut pile carpets, the plies must be twisted firmly together; otherwise, they will untwist prematurely. To achieve acceptable twisting, a 

 lubricant solution must be applied to the component yarns in an amount of approximately 1% of the total yarn mass. The lubricant ingredients are then removed from the yarn when the carpets are dyed or scoured before sale, thus interfering with the treatment of effluent streams in waste water treatment systems of carpet mill communities. Yarn preparation systems which do not need such lubricants would be a great advantage.A proposed alternative method for making carpet yarns is a stitching operation, where the component yarns are enchained together by a series of lock stitches, as described in Parlin, U.S. Patent 2,822,605. This operation involves varying the tension applied to the individual yarn strands, such that each yarn strand forms a series of tightly held loops and loosely held loops along its length. The process is carried out upon an overedge stitcher provided with a chain-forming
