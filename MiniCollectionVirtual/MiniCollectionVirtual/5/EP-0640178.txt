<ABSTRACT>
A method of operating an internal combustion engine in which quantities of a hydrocarbon fuel and hydrogen are introduced into the combustion chamber of the engine. The combustion chamber is provided with igniter means and the delivery of hydrogen is timed relative to the delivery of the fuel and preferably also the activation of the igniter means to establish an ignitable mixture at the igniter means at the time of activation of the igniter means.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the combustion process of an internal
combustion engine and particularly to the enhancement of that process to
reduce the level of exhaust emissions and/or improve combustion stability
and/or otherwise enhance the combustion process.All major industrial countries currently have regulations relating to
the level of exhaust emissions from motor vehicles, particularly passenger type
vehicles. The controlling authorities are progressively reducing the permitted
level of emissions thereby increasing the demand for greater control of the
combustion process of internal combustion engines. The regulations regarding
the control of exhaust emissions apply a test procedure wherein engine
operation at low to medium load is typically a significant factor and unfortunately
these areas of operation of the engine present a substantial difficulty in control of
the combustion process.In the low to medium range of operation of an engine, the rate of
fuel consumption is such that the distribution of fuel within the air charge in the
combustion chamber is preferably of a stratified nature so that a sufficiently rich
mixture exists in the vicinity of the ignition device to provide reliable initiation of
combustion. The creation of the stratified fuel distribution is particularly difficult
to achieve where the fuel is introduced into the air charge prior to the air charge
entering the combustion chamber, particularly as the fuel must be delivered into
the air charge at a time related to the engine cycle to ensure that all of the fuel
reaches the combustion chamber before the inlet port is closed. Thus there is a
substantial time interval for the fuel to disperse in the air charge both in the air
intake system and in the combustion chamber before and after closing of the
inlet port.Some degree of success has been achieved in establishing a
stratified charge by the use of a fuel injector to deliver the fuel into the air charge
at a location only a relatively short distance upstream from the inlet port. This
permits relatively late injection of the fuel and restricts the time available for
dispersion of the fuel within the air charge. Further improvement has been 
obtained by the injection of the fuel directly into the combustion chamber.
However, this introduces the further problem that the fuel must be injected at
a near sonic velocity to achieve the necessary degree of atomisation of the fuel.
Moreover, the high velocity also results in a significant dispersion of the fuel
within the combustion
