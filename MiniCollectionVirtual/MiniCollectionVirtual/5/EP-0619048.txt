<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to ac drive controllers and 
specifically to a modularly constructed ac drive controller and modular 
components therefor. The speed of an ac motor is directly proportional to the 
frequency of the alternating current (ac) power supplied to it. Thus, 
when it is required to alter the speed of an ac motor, the frequency of 
the ac power supplied to it must be varied. Typically, such variation is provided by a drive controller 
which includes three principal components: a power convertor assembly 
to convert the fixed-frequency ac power supplied to the drive controller 
into direct current (dc) power; a power invertor to invert the dc power 
from the convertor into polyphase ac power which is supplied to the 
motor; and a control assembly which controls the power invertor 
assembly to vary the frequency of the ac power supplied by the invertor, 
and hence the speed of the motor. Drive controllers are continually being developed which 
offer improvements in the size of the motors which can be controlled, 
the range of available speeds, the efficiency of the controller, etc. It is an object of the present invention to provide a novel, 
modularly constructed AC Drive Controller and modular components 
therefor.  
 According to the present invention, there is provided an ac 
drive controller comprising: a power convertor to convert ac power 
supplied to the power convertor into negative and positive dc voltages; 
a plurality of invertor modules each being electrically connected to said 
power convertor to receive said positive and negative dc voltages and 
supplying an ac output voltage constituting one phase of a multiphase 
supply, each invertor module including at least first and second 
electronic switching devices, said first electronic switching device being 
connected between said negative dc voltage and said one phase and said 
second electronic switching device being connected between said positive 
dc voltage and said one phase, said first and second switching devices 
being responsive to control signals to supply alternately said negative 
and positive dc voltages to said one phase; a filter for each invertor 
module removably connected between said negative and positive dc 
voltages; electrical connection means to connect releasably said filters 
to said dc voltages adjacent the point where said switching devices are 
connected to said dc voltages to minimize stray reactance introduced by 
the electrical connection between said filters and said switching devices; 
and
