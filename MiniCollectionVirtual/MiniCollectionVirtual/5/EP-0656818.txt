<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved method and apparatus for cutting 
coiled wire. The invention is applicable with particular advantage to the production of 
circlips. Circlips are components used in a wide variety of industries and methods have 
been developed over the years for the mass production of such circlips. In most cases 
however the circlip is an important component which has to be accurately machined and 
treated to ensure the correct parameters of shape, dimension, strength and resilience. 
Thus, any method of production of a circlip depends not only on the creation of the 
shape but also on the further processing of the circlip. The shape of a circlip is generally a split annulus where the annular member is 
generally planar. Most circlips are not exactly annular since they are designed to have 
a slightly different shape. However, they can be regarded as approximating to a ring. 
In the present specification, the term "ring" will be used to cover generally annular 
members, split annular members and split substantially annular members such as 
circlips. It is also intended to encompass in its broadest sense a piece cut from a coil 
which describes over more than 360 degrees. Traditionally, there are two methods of production of circlips. For smaller 
circlips of diameter up to around 30mm, for example, the circlips are pressed out of a 
steel strip. Most circlips having a diameter greater than 30mm are created from coiled 
wire. US 2948322 forming the base of the preambles of claims 1, 2 and 10 
discloses a method of forming a plurality of rings from a length of 
wire. The rings comprise a split annulus to be used as an inner shell spacing for use in 
an oil seal. The method comprises passing a wire through a coiling station to form a coil 
about a longitudinal axis. As the coil is being formed a free end describes a helical path 
about the longitudinal axis in a direction of the longitudinal axis downstream from the 
coiling station. When the free end rotates to an extent of 360Â° past a cutting block a  
 
blade moves from a retracted position to a cutting position to cut the coil to form a ring. 
After cutting, the blade retracts to allow the newly cut free end of the coiled strip to 
progress in the direction of the longitudinal axis downstream from the rolling station. When a circlip is formed from coiled wire, once the ring has been cut from coil, 
the ring has to undergo many treatments. A major problem occurring in circlip 
manufacture is the tangling of circlips and

<CLAIMS>
A method of forming a plurality of aligned rings from a length of wire (9), in 
which:- 


wire passes through a continuously operating coiling station (3) to form a coil about a 
longitudinal axis (11); 
the free end of the wire describes a helical path about the longitudinal axis (11) and in 
the direction of the longitudinal axis (11) downstream from the coiling station (3) until 

the free end (21) of the wire abuts a stop (5) so arresting further movement of the free 
end of the wire; 
a blade (7) moves from a first retracted position to a second cutting position to cut the 
coil to form a ring (23); 
the blade (7) then retracts to allow the newly cut free end (21) of the wire to progress 
forwards in a direction away from the coiling station (3); 
characterised in that the stop is arranged such that the newly cut ring (23) may be 
pushed by the free end (21) of the wire forward in a longitudinal direction (13) to be 

supported and then fed as one of a plurality of aligned rings supported on a support (8) 
extending in a longitudinal direction from the region of the stop in a downstream 

direction to further processing stations. 
Apparatus (1) for forming a plurality of aligned rings from a length of wire 
comprising; 


a coiling station (3) which includes a wire inlet (2) for receiving a length of wire, and 
operates to form a coil about a longitudinal axis (11) which is fed from the coiling 

station (3) such that the free downstream end (21) of the wire describes a helical path 
about the longitudinal axis (11) and in the direction (13) of the longitudinal axis and; 
a cutting station (4) downstream of the coiling station (3), including a stop (5) spaced 
from the coiling station (3) whereby in use a plurality of turns of coil lie between the 

coiling station (3) and the stop (5), the cutting station (4) also including a retractable  
 

blade (7) movable from a cutting position to a non-cutting position where further 
movement of the free end of the coil can take place; whereby a coil formed by the 

coiling station (3) progresses forwards in a longitudinal direction (13) until the free end 
(21) of the wire abuts the stop (5) whereupon the blade (7) moves to its cutting position 

to cut a ring (23), the blade (7) retracts to a non-cutting position whereupon the newly 
cut free end (21) of the coil moves forward along its helical path urging the cut ring 

forwards characterised in that the cut ring is supported by a support (8) extending in a 
longitudinal direction from the region of the stop (5) in a downstream direction for 

feeding as one of a plurality of aligned rings to a further processing station. 
Apparatus according to claim 2 in which the stop (5) comprises a relatively thin 
member such that the cut in the ring can slip over the stop once the cut has taken place. 
Apparatus in accordance with claim 2 or 3 in which the blade (7) is arranged to 
cut the coil in the direction of the longitudinal axis. 
Apparatus in accordance with claim 3 in which the blade (7) also serves as the 
stop (5). 
Apparatus in accordance with any of claims 2 to 5 in which the cut in the wire is 
achieved by a shear action where the retractable blade (7) cuts against a fixed blade (15) 

to create a scissor effect. 
Apparatus in accordance with claim 6 in which a pusher member (19) is mounted 
adjacent the fixed blade (15) and is mounted to move with the retractable blade (7) such 

that on retraction of the retractable blade (7) from its cutting position the pusher (19) 
pushes the free end of the coil past the fixed blade (15) so that it can freely wind towards 

the stop. 
Apparatus in accordance with any one of claims 2 to 7 in which the movement 
of the retractable blade (7) is controlled by a cam created by the blade (7) having an 

inclined cam follower surface (31) which cooperates within an inclined cam surface (29) 
of a cam (27) which moves in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal axis the 

movement of the cam (27) being in a substantially vertical direction.  
 
Apparatus in accordance with claims 2 to 8 in which the apparatus incorporates 
gap straightening means (97) which bears against the coil and the cut rings to keep them 

aligned. 
Apparatus for forming a plurality of aligned rings from a length of wire 
comprising: 


a coiling station (3) which includes a wire inlet (2) for receiving a length of wire and 
operates to form a coil about a longitudinal axis which is fed from the coiling station (3) 

such that the free downstream end of the wire describes a helical path about the 
longitudinal axis and in the direction of the longitudinal axis and; 
a cutting station (4) downstream of the coiling station (3) including a fixed blade (15), 
and a retractable blade (7), the retractable blade (7) mounted to reciprocate in a 

longitudinal direction from a non-cutting position to a cutting position where a cut 
through the coil takes place by a scissor effect against the fixed blade (15), the 

retractable blade (7) having a face aligned with the longitudinal axis which acts as a stop 
(5) against which the free end of the coil abuts, such that a coil formed by the coiling 

station (3) progresses forwards in a longitudinal direction until the free end of the wire 
abuts the stop (5) whereupon the retractable blade (7) moves in a longitudinal direction 

opposite to the direction of movement of the coil, to cut against the fixed blade (15) to 
form a ring; 
characterised in that a pusher member (19) is mounted to move with the retractable 
blade (7) such that when the blade (7) retracts to its non-cutting position the pusher 

member (19) urges the newly cut free end of the wire over the fixed blade (15), and the 
retraction of the retractable blade (7) in a forward direction allows the pusher member 

(19) to move forwards and push the newly cut free end of the wire to move forwards 
along its helical path until it abuts the stop (5), the newly cut free end pushing the newly 

cut ring forwards over the retractable blade (7) to be supported by a support (8) 
extending in a longitudinal direction from the region of the retractable blade (7) towards 

a further processing station.
