<ABSTRACT>
Telescopic lifting frame for a handling vehicle, having an outer mast (12) firmly attached to the handling vehicle and at least one further mast (18, 24) guided on the outer mast in a vertically adjustable manner. In this arrangement, at least one roller (32, 34) is rotatably mounted on the further mast (18) on opposite sides. The roller (32, 34) is guided in a corresponding profile (36, 38) of the outer mast (12). Connected to the further mast (18) is a sliding piece having a sliding section (72) which lies between roller (32, 34) and allocated profile surface of the outer mast, slides with a sliding surface (74) on the allocated profile surface and is at a slight distance from the roller (32, 34).

<CLAIMS>
A telescopic mast arranged on a handling vehicle with an outer mast (12) rigidly
attached to the handling vehicle and at least one further mast (18, 24) height-adjustably

guided on the outer mast, wherein on one of the two masts at least one
roller (32, 34) is rotatably mounted which is guided in a corresponding profile (36,

38) of the other mast, wherein between the roller (32, 34) and the associated profile
surface of the other mast there is arranged a guiding element which is attached to

the first mast and which has a small distance to the roller (32, 34), characterised in
that the roller (32, 34) is mounted on the guided mast (18, 24), that as a guiding

element there serves a wedge-shaped sliding piece with a sliding section (72) which
lies between the roller (32, 34) and the associated profile surface of the outer mast

(12) and which slides with a sliding surface (74) on the associated profile surface of
the outer mast, wherein by way of a vertical adjustment of the sliding piece the

distance of the surface (76) of the sliding section (72), which faces the roller (32,
34) can be changed and that the sliding piece is displaceably mounted so far that

the roller (32, 34) with a corresponding loading may bear on the surface (76)
overcoming the distance.
A telescopic mast according to claim 1, characterised in that the sliding section
(72) is mounted on a threaded bolt (64) with play, the threaded bolt sitting in a

threaded bore of a holding section (60).
A telescopic mast according to claim 2, characterised in that the holding section
(60) is formed by a plate attached on the lower side of the mast profile (20, 22). 
A telescopic mast according to one of the claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the
sliding section (72) is displaceable with respect to the other mast (16).
