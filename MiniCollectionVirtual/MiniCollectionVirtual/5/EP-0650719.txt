<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the production of a granular composition for removing the colour from or bleaching hair, in which a powdered mixture containing inorganic persulphates, a binder and conventional auxiliaries and additives is sprayed with an alcohol in a granulating apparatus, and the resulting granules are subsequently dried, and to the composition produced by this process for removing the colour from and bleaching hair.

<CLAIMS>
Process for the production of an agent
which is in granular form for removing the colour

from or for bleaching hair, characterised in that
in a granulator at room temperature an alcohol is

sprayed over a mixture which is in the form of a
powder and which contains at least one inorganic

persulphate and conventional auxiliary and
additional substances, in addition to a binding

agent and, subsequently, drying the granulate
obtained.
Process according to Claim 1,
characterised in that ethanol, isopropanol or a

mixture of these two alcohols is used as the
alcohol.
Process according to Claim 1 or Claim 2,
characterised in that the ratio of mixture in

powder form to alcohol is 13:1 to 4:1.
Process according to any one of Claims 1
to 3, characterised in that polyethylene glycols

with a molecular weight of from 200 to 10000, or
polyvinylpyrolidone are used as the binding agent. 
Process according to any one of Claims 1
to 4, characterised in that the binding agent is

contained in an amount of from 1 to 20 weight % in
the mixture which is in the form of a powder.
Process according to any one of Claims 1
to 5, characterised in that the duration of the

granulation is from 10 to 60 minutes.
Process according to any one of Claims 1
to 6, characterised in that the mixture in the

form of powder which is used for the granulation
contains from 30 to 65 weight % of at least one

inorganic persulphate.
Process according to any one of Claims 1
to 7, characterised in that the inorganic

persulphate is selected from sodium persulphate,
potassium persulphate and ammonium persulphate.
Composition which is in granular form for
removing the color from hair or for bleaching hair, characterized in that it is

produced by a process according to any one of claims 1 to 8.
