<ABSTRACT>
A false ceiling of inlay construction type exhibits a suspended load-bearing grid which comprises longitudinal rails (3) and transverse rails (4). Ceiling panels (13) are laid in the sections (12) of the load-bearing grid. Retaining bars (14) bearing on the ceiling panels (13) are anchored, at their two ends, in a positively locking manner on the longitudinal rails (3). The retaining rails (14) support the ceiling panels (13) against being raised and curved upwards if there is a pressure surge beneath the false ceiling. Consequently, the fire resistance of a false ceiling remains intact even if the latter is subjected to a pressure surge.
