<ABSTRACT>
A process for the preparation of coatings using a coating composition which contains as binder a two-component system comprising a) a polyisocyanate component and b) a reactive component which is reactive towards polyisocyanates and which comprises b1) specific, secondary polyamines which contain ester groups, b2) specific, moisture-activatable, blocked polyamines and, if desired, b3) other compounds which are known per se from polyurethane chemistry and which contain groups which are reactive towards isocyanate groups.

Process for the production of surface coatings by
coating any desired substrates with a coating agent

that contains as binding agent a two-component system
consisting of


a) a polyisocyanate component with the exception of
aromatic polyisocyanates, and
b) a reactive component reactive towards
polyisocyanates, and optionally the auxiliaries

and additives known from coating technology,
characterised in that the binding agent b)

comprises mixtures of

b1) compounds of the general formula (I)

b2) compounds of the molecular weight range Mn of
from 73 to 10,000 that contain per molecule at

least one structural unit of formula (II)

 
and optionally
b3) other compounds known per se from polyurethane
chemistry containing groups reactive towards

isocyanate groups, with the exception of
aldimines and ketimines,

in which formulae

X
represents an n-valent radical inert towards
isocyanate groups, such as is obtained by

removing the primary amino groups from a
corresponding polyamine having (cyclo)-aliphatically

bonded amino groups and a
molecular weight range of from 60 to 6,000,
R
1
 and R
2
represent the same or different alkyl
radicals having from 1 to 18 carbon atoms,
n
is an integer of at least 2, and
m
is 0 or 1.
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that
there are used as component b1) compounds of the

general formula (I) wherein R
1
 and R
2
 represent a
methyl, ethyl, n-butyl or 2-ethylhexyl group.
Process according to claim 1 and 2, characterised in
that there are used as component b1) compounds of the

general formula (I) wherein X represents the radical
such as is obtained by removing the amino groups from

1-amino-3,3,5-trimethyl-5-aminomethylcyclohexane,
4,4'-diaminodicyclohexylmethane, 3,3'-dimethyl-4,4'diaminodicyclohexylmethane,

hexahydro-2,4- and/or 
-2,6-diaminotoluene, the isomers of C-monomethyldiaminodicyclohexylmethane

or from 3(4)-aminomethyl-1-methylcyclohexylamine.
Process according to claims 1 to 3, characterised in
that there are used as component b2) compounds having

a molecular weight range Mn of from 73 to 3,000 that
contain per molecule from 1 to 3 structural units of

formula (III)


wherein

R
3
represents hydrogen or an alkyl radical having
from 1 to 6 carbon atoms,
R
4
 and R
5
represent the same or different radicals and
are hydrogen or alkyl radicals having from 1

to 3 carbon atoms,
R
6
 and R
7
represent the same or different radicals and
are hydrogen or inert organic radicals, it

also being possible for the radicals R
6
 and
R
7
, together with the carbon atoms of the
heterocyclic ring, to be linked to form a 5-

or 6-membered cycloaliphatic ring, with the
proviso that a maximum of one of the 

radicals R
6
 and R
7
 represents hydrogen, and
m
represents 0 or 1.
Process according to claims 1 to 4, characterised in
that there are used as component b2) compounds having

a molecular weight range of from 73 to 1,500 that
contain per molecule from 1 to 3 structural units of

R
6

7
are as defined in claim 4, and
R
8
represents an alkylene radical having from 2 to 6
carbon atoms, with the proviso that 2 or 3 carbon

atoms are arranged between the oxygen atom and
the nitrogen atom.
Process according to claims 1 to 5, characterised in
that there are used as component b3) copolymers having

a molecular weight range Mn of from 800 to 50,000 and
a hydroxyl group content of from 0.1 to 12 wt.% of

Process according to claims 1 to 6, characterised in
that the amount of component b1) is from 1 to 99 wt.%,

the amount of component b2) is from 1 to
