<ABSTRACT>
A semi-finished wood simulating product and method 
is disclosed. The product is manufactured by providing a 

substrate having at least one surface to be finished. A 
liquid basecoat is applied on the substrate and dried. A 

wood grain pattern is deposited, in liquid form, on the 
basecoat. Some of the pattern is transferred from the 

originally deposited position on the basecoat to a 
subsequent position. The pattern is then cured. A 

polymerizable protective coating is applied onto the 
substrate overlying the basecoat and the pattern. The 

protective coating seals the substrate and is adapted for 
accepting a colorant to be applied by an end user. The 

protective coating is then polymerized. Additionally, if 
a porous substrate is provided, a sealer is applied prior 

to the liquid basecoat and is then cured.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for manufacturing
semi-finished wood simulating products having a
surface that simulates the appearance and tactile qualities
of raw wood and is capable of accepting paint, varnish
or stain as applied by an end user, comprising the
steps of providing a substrate; applying a liquid basecoat
on the substrate; drying the basecoat; depositing,
in liquid form, a wood grain pattern on the basecoat and
a protective coating is applied onto the substrate to
overlie the basecoat and the pattern and seal the substrate.
A method comprising these steps is known from EP-A-0
497 020.There is a need to substitute wood simulating products
for solid or real wood products to reduce material costs.
This need to substitute simulated wood products for real
wood is particularly acute for hardwood products. These
hardwoods include woods such as lauan, mahogany, and
other woods of that same family, the bulk of which come
from the Philippines and other pacific and forest locations.
Over the last ten years, the availability of such
woods has greatly diminished, and the remaining supply
has diminished markedly in quality. There are also
substantial environmental issues and concerns affecting
both the quality and quantity of the real wood supply, in
part, because these woods come from "rain forest" areas
which have been "harvested" over the years as part of a 
general land clearing program which did not include
replanting, etc.A traditional method of manufacturing simulated wood
products such as paneling, or door-skins for hollow core
doors, involves utilizing a non-solid wood substrate such
as a wood composite or fiberboard substrate and overlaying
this substrate with an overlay of paper or vinyl and
then applying a protective coating to the paper overlay.
This method involves the risk of the paper or vinyl overlay
product peeling from the substrate. Another problem
is that bubbles and blisters sometimes occur in the overlay
process.Another method for manufacturing a wood simulating product
is known from EP-A-0 497 020. According to the
method disclosed in this document a metal or plastic surface
of a substrate is first covered with a liquid basecoat
composition and then dried to remove the volatile
solvents, thereby forming a hardened basecoat. An ink
formulation is then applied to the basecoat with a roller
having a corresponding wood rain pattern. After application
of the graining ink formulation and air-drying the
final product may be stained with a conventional wood
stain and then

Method for manufacturing semi-finished wood simulating
products having a surface that simulates the

appearance and tactile qualities of raw wood and is
capable of accepting paint, varnish or stain as

applied by an end user, comprising the steps of

providing a substrate (102, 122);

applying a liquid basecoat (110) on the substrate
(102);

drying the basecoat (110);

depositing, in liquid form, a wood grain pattern on
the basecoat (110) and a protective coating (112) is

applied onto the substrate (102, 122) to overlie the
basecoat (110) and the pattern and seal the substrate

(102, 122), 
characterized in that
 after its application
the wood grain pattern is cured and the protective

coating has sufficient porosity to absorb and
retain a colorant or stain applied thereto and 
in
that
 the protective coating is polymerized before application
of a colorant or stain.
Method as in claim 1, including the step of providing
a substrate (102) having a porous surface (114).
Method as in claim 2, including the step of providing
a substrate (102) that is one of medium sensity

fiberboard and pressboard. 
Method as in claim 2 or 3, including the steps of
cleaning the surface (114) of the substrate (102);

coating the surface (114) with a sealer (108); and
curing the sealer (108).
Method as in claim 1, including the step of providing
a substrate (122) having a non-porous surface.
Method as in claim 5, including the step of providing
a sealer (108) having sufficient impermeability to

prevent liquid materials applied thereon from penetrating
through the sealer (108) and contacting the

substrate (102).
Method as in any preceding claim, including the step
of providing a protective coating (112) having sufficient

transparency to permit the wood grain pattern
to be visible therethrough.
Method as in any preceding claim, wherein after its
deposition some of the pattern are transferred from

the original deposited position on the basecoat (119)
to a subsequent position.
Method as in any preceding claim, including the step
of rolling a rotary print cylinder relative to the

substrate (102, 122) from a starting edge to an ending
edge
 of said substrate (102, 122).
Method as in claim 8 or 9, including the step of initiating
said rolling step so that the rotary print 

cylinder starts rolling randomly relative to the
starting edge such that the wood pattern is deposited

randomly relative to the starting edge.
Method as in any preceding claim, including the step
of applying the basecoat (110) in at least first and

second layers.
Method as in claim 1, including the steps of providing
a dwell period following the application of the

first basecoat sufficient to permit the first basecoat
layer to level;

providing a dwell period following application of the
second basecoat sufficient to permit the second basecoat

layer to level;
