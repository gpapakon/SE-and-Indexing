<ABSTRACT>
A communication method for machine controller by which a machine controller can make communication without receiving any
influence from disconnection nor electrical external noise nor requiring troublesome cable laying work. The need of troublesome cable

laying work and the occurrence of abnormal communication caused by disconnection and external electrical noise are eliminated by making
communication, such as the input-output of voltage commands (PWM commands), feedback signals, etc., by means of infrared beam

between a numerical controller (1) of a main control unit and servo amplifiers (2a, 2b, ...), etc., of the drive control units of the servo motors
of a machine tool, etc. In addition, the design of the arranging position of each equipment is made easier.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improvement of a
communication method in a controller of a machine.A telecommunication cable or an optical cable has been used in
communication between a numerical control device or the like as a
main control unit and an interface device, and between the numerical
control device or the like and a servo amplifier or the like as a drive
control unit. In using either cable, a lead-around work of cables is
troublesome and may cause disconnection thereof, and in particular
the telecommunication cable picks up an electrical external noise
which may cause an abnormality in communication data. GB-A-2204426 discloses a machine tool, in particular a
grinding machine, according to the preamble of attached
claim 1, comprising a plurality of drive motors with
corresponding drive motor controllers and having a main
control unit for issuing commands to the drive motor, these
commands being transmitted from the main control unit via a
conductor means in the form of a flexible cable
constituting a data circuit or data line. Further,
commands may be sent to the main control unit by a remote
hand-held transmitter of ultrasonic, infra-red or radio
waves, although connections within the machine itself are
made conventionally by conductor cables.US-A-4933868 discloses a cutting tool with a control
computer communicating with a tool bit positioning computer
through transmitting and receiving photodiodes. This is a
very simple use of light radiation for communication from
one part to another of a machine tool.It is an object of the present invention to provide a
communication method in a controller of a machine which is
not affected by disconnection of cables and electrical
external noises, nor requires any complicated lead-around
work of cables.According to the present invention there is provided a
machine comprising a plurality of drive motors
with corresponding drive motor controllers, and having a
main control unit for issuing commands to the drive motor
controllers; characterised in that infrared communication
interfaces are provided on said main control unit and on
said drive motor controllers, arranged to communicate said
commands therebetween as infrared signals, with said drive
motor controllers being connected one to another in series,
such that infrared communication between the main control 
unit and the drive motor controllers will be performed in
daisy chain manner. Further, an infrared communication interface may be provided
on an interface device for connecting the main
