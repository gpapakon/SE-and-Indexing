<ABSTRACT>
In a communications system, a method is described allowing two users having established a 
communication session identified by a unique session freshness proof, to transmit and validate 

a new value of a variable by using an exchange certificate which combines the following elements 
: the new value of the variable, a common secret key known by both users, an exchange 

counter representative of the number of values of said variable transmitted between the two users 
during the current communication session and a session freshness proof. Protection against potential 

eavesdroppers and intruders is provided by combining cryptographically the elements of 
the exchange certificate. Further protection is obtained by interrupting the current communication 

session and opening a new one characterized by a new unique session freshness proof 
when the exchange counter reaches its maximum value; thus avoiding the risk that the same 

value of the session freshness keeps being used when the exchange counter is reset to its initial 
value. Consequently a given pair of values of the session freshness proof and of the exchange 

counter will never be used more than one time, making eavesdropping and, replaying attacks 
from intruders more difficult. Preferably, the method used for opening a new communication 

session uses already known authentication methods based on the common secret key.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to methods to maintain security in computer 
networks. In particular, it relates to methods for validating information exchanged between authorized 
users or other authorized network entities. Computer network security techniques include a wide range of methods such as access control 
mechanisms, user authentication methods, cryptographic systems and traffic integrity protection. 
Appropriate selection and combination of such methods allows to build very secure networks 
at the expense of overall system complexity, cost increase and performance degradation. This is 
particularly the case in the arena of encryption keys distribution services for which dynamic 
schemes using key distribution servers have been developed.
 
U.S. Patent No 5,148,479 discloses a method of mutually authenticating users on a commumcations 
session. A first user A transmits a challenge N1 to a second user B. In response to the 
first challenge, B generates a first response to the challenge N1 and transmits it to A along with 
a second challenge N2. User A verifies that the first response to the challenge N1 is correct and 
then generates and transmits to B a second response to the second challenge N2. User B verifies 
that the second response is correct. User A and user B are supposed to share a secret which allows 
them to verify the correctness of the responses to their challenges. Ideally challenges should 
be different in every authentication instance, therefore it is suggested that challenges be selected 
randomly from a huge space; these challenges are called nonce challenges. This kind of user authentication methods does not always provide sufficient protection 
against intruders attacks, for instance when data lines cannot be physically secured from 
taps. More generally, intercept attacks where an intruder merely intercepts messages from a user 
A to a user B and forwards them on to their intended destination B cannot be defended against 
with user authentication protocols; for instance, such theft and replay attacks can occur in 
wireless data communications systems using radio frequency or infrared transmission. In such 
a case, measures are necessary to provide data security in addition to the methods allowing user  
 
A and user B to authenticate one another. The encryption of the data flow between A and B is 
obviously one of these measures.
 
One of the best known secret-key cryptosystems is the so called Data Encryption Standard 
(DES) which has been standardized by ANSI;

A method for transmitting a value K' of a variable, between a first user A of a communications 
system and a second user B, and for validating said value K', said users sharing a 

common secret key S and having established a first communication session identified by a 
first unique session freshness proof N2 known to both user A and user B, said method being 

characterized in that it comprises the steps of: 

a. transmitting from A to B said value K' by means of an exchange certificate comprising 
at least two fields M1 and M2 of the minimum form:M1= f( S, K', ... ) M2= g( S, K', N2, c1, ... ) 

 
   wherein f( ) and g( ) are functions such that, 

   f( S, K', ... ) = m1 cannot be solved for K' without 
   knowledge of S, m1 being a given value of field M1 and, 

   g( S, K', N2, c1, ... ) = m2 cannot be solved for K' without 
   knowledge of S, m2 being a given value of field M2; 

   and wherein, 
   c1 is an exchange counter controlled by A and representative of the number of 

values of said variable exchanged between user A and user B during said first 
communication session. 
b. processing by B of said exchange certificate M comprising the steps of: 

deriving from said exchange certificate M said value K' as a result of solving for 
K' equation:f( S, K', ... ) = M1; and 
validating said value K' as a result of the verification of a set of validation conditions 
comprising at least an equation of the minimum form:g( S, K', N2, c2, ... ) = M2 wherein, 

 
   c2 is an exchange counter controlled by B and representative of the number of 

values of said variable exchanged between user A and user B during said first 
communication session. 
c. interrupting at the initiative of either A or B said first communication session between 
A and B and opening a second communication session identified by a second unique 

session freshness proof upon occurrence of anyone of a set of session reset conditions,

op and op' are mathematical or Boolean operations; and 
q, r, s, t are functions of the minimum formq = q(K', ...) r = r(N2, ...) s = s(K', ...) t = t(c1, ...)
