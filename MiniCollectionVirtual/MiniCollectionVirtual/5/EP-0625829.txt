<ABSTRACT>
A method is disclosed for a post-processor for providing reliability 
information about every decoded data symbol at the output of an arbitrary decoder. 

This reliability information is generated by comparing the decoded sequence to a 
small list of alternative sequences which differ from the decoded sequence at least in 

the symbol for which the reliability is being evaluated. It is shown that this algorithm 
is a simplification of the optimal symbol-by-symbol detector (OSSD).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is a method and apparatus for post-processoring to
provide reliability information for decoded data symbols at the output of a decoder.The Viterbi algorithm (VA) is well known as an efficient maximum
likelihood (ML) sequence estimator of data encoded by a finite state machine and
corrupted by white noise. See, G.D. Forney Jr., "The Viterbi Algorithm," Proc.
IEEE, vol. 61, no. 3, pp. 268-278, Mar. 1973. In many applications, the output of the
Viterbi decoder is further processed by a second decoder in a concatenated coding
system. FIG. 1 shows a concatenated coding system in which outer encoder 121
transforms an information sequence a(k) into sequence b(k). Inner encoder 123
further encodes sequence b(k) to produce a sequence to be transmitted. Inner
decoder 125 decodes the received sequence r(k) to produce an estimate b and(k) of the
sequence encoded by inner encoder 123. Outer decoder 127 then uses b and(k) to
generate an estimate â(k) of the information sequence. Table 1 lists four examples of
specific coder combinations typical for the concatenated system of FIG. 1. In all of
these, the optimal decoder should operate on the joint state space of the outer and the
inner code to obtain an estimate of the information sequence. However, in the first
coding combination, i.e. the combined speech and channel coding scheme, of
Table 1, it is not yet known how to describe such a decoder. In the other three cases,
such a decoder may be too complex to implement especially when powerful codes
are used for inner and outer codes. Hence a practical approach is to first perform the
decoding of the received data by the inner decoder followed by outer decoding.

DecoderErrors and
Erasures DecoderTypically, the inner decoder produces burst errors. If the outer code is a
random error correcting code, then an interleaver/deinterleaver pair 222,226 as
illustrated in FIG. 2 may be inserted in the coding system of FIG. 1. The pair will
help to pseudo-randomize the burst of errors so as to facilitate the outer decoding
process. If the outer code/intefleaver/inner code combination is thought of as a new
code, then its optimal decoder, which requires exhaustive search, is even more
difficult to
