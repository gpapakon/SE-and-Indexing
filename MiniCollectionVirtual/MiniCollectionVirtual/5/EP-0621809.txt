<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a bottle inspecting machine with several inspection sections (8-10) arranged one behind the other and equipped for various inspection tasks and a sorting station (11) directing the bottles to various conveyor sections (2-5) depending on the results of the inspection. To check the operation of the machine, an auxiliary conveyor section consisting of a rotary bottle carrier (13) form with the inspection sections (8-10) a closed circuit in which test bottles (T) can be transferred from a magazine. The inspection sections (8-10) consisting of rotary bottle carrier, like the bottle carrier (13) forming the auxiliary conveyor section, have circumferential holes for the bottles and, for operation checking, form a continuous row with their holders. It is possible in this way to make a system test on the control devices even at high machine outputs with a few test bottles (T), especially with the test bottles (T) passing through repeatedly, without any manual operation.

A bottle inspection machine with a plurality of inspection 
sections (8-10) that are arranged one behind the other and 

equipped to carry out different inspection tasks such as 
checking for height and bottle type, checking the wall, 

mouth area, and bottom of the bottles, checking for residual 
liquid content, and stoppers, in particular bail-type 

stoppers, through which the bottles are moved by one or a 
plurality of rotating bottle carriers that are arranged one 

behind the other and which have receiving points for the 
bottles in their peripheries, and then inspected, with a 

sorting station (11) that is arranged at the end of the 
inspection sections (8-10) which, depending on the results 

of the inspection, passes the bottles to different conveyor 
sections (3-5), and with a magazine (13, 14, 22) that can be 

connected to the inspection sections (8-10), from which 
test bottles (T) can be moved into the inspection sections 

(8-10) and, in particular, from the inspection sections (8-10) 
back into the magazine (13, 14, 22), it being possible 

to short-circuit the beginning and the end of the inspection 
sections (8-10) through a secondary conveyor section (N), 

thereby forming a closed circuit for the test bottles (T), 
characterized in that the secondary conveyor section (N) is 

in the form of a rotating bottle carrier (13, 14, 21) with 
receiving points for the test bottles (T) arranged on its 

periphery, and in the closed state the receiving points of the 
bottle carrier (13, 14) that forms the secondary conveyor 

section (N) in the short-circuited state and the receiving 
points of the other bottle carrier(s) that form(s) the 

inspection sections (8-10) form a continuous chain of 
receiving points for the test bottles (T). 
A bottle inspection machine as defined in claim 1, 
characterized in that the sorting station (11) does not lie  

 
in the closed circuit of the inspection sections (8-10) and 

of the secondary conveyor section (N). 
A bottle inspection machine as defined in claim 1 or claim 
2, characterized in that the number of receiving points of 

the closed circuit is a multiple of the number of receiving 
points of the bottle carrier (13, 14) that includes the 

secondary conveyor section (N). 
A bottle inspection machine as defined in one of the claims 
1 to 3, characterized in that the secondary conveyor section 

that is formed as a rotating bottle carrier (13, 14) with a 
fixed axis of rotation forms the magazine and, on the 

periphery of this bottle carrier (13, 14) in the area of its 
receiving points, there is at least one recess (13a, 13b, 

14a) which, when the bottle carrier (13, 14) that is 
stationary is out of the circuit, permits the unhindered 

movement of bottles from the inlet of the machine to the 
inspection sections (7-11) and from the inspection sections 

(7-11) to the outlet (3-5) of the machine. 
A bottle inspection machine as defined in one of the claims, 
1 to 3, characterized in that the magazine (22) can be 

connected to the secondary conveyor section (N) that is 
formed as a rotating bottle carrier (21) with a fixed axis 

of rotation, the receiving points of this corresponding in 
their division to the division of the receiving points of 

the inspection sections (8-10) and which can be driven in 
the same direction and in synchrony with the receiving 

points in the secondary conveyor section (N). 
A bottle inspection machine as defined in claim 5, 
characterized in that the magazine (22) together with the 

receiving points, forms a circular section.  
 
A bottle inspection machine as defined in one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that resettable switches 

(15, 16) are arranged in the inspection sections (8-10) at 
the transfer points to the secondary conveyor section (N) in 

at least four positions: 

In the first position the switches (15, 16), the test 
bottles (T), move from the secondary conveyor section 

(N) into the inspection sections (8-10); 
In the second switch position of the switches (15, 16), 
the inspection sections (8-10) are short-circuited in 

that the bottles move from the inspection sections (8-10) 
through the secondary conveyor section (N) back 

into the inspections (8-10); 
In the third switch position of the switches (15, 16), 
the test bottles (T) move from the inspection sections 

(8-10) into the secondary conveyor section (N) and

In the fourth switch position, the bottles pass the 
inspection sections (8-10) to the secondary conveyor 

section (N).
