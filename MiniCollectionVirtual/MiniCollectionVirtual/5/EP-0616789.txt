<ABSTRACT>
A vacuum cleaner hose has a tubular connection piece (3) onto which a suction hose (2) is pushed at one end. To ensure simple mounting and a secure hold, ribs (6) are provided on the tubular connection piece which project beyond the diameter of the tubular connection piece, are sawtooth-shaped in cross-section and extend in the axial direction of the tubular connection piece (3).

Vacuum cleaner hose with a grip member and a suction hose (2) mounted
over one end of a tubular nozzle (3) of the grip member and with ribs (6)

provided on the outer surface of the tubular nozzle (3), which ribs engage
with the inner surface of the suction hose (2), wherein the diameter of the

tubular nozzle (3) matches that of the inner surface, characterised in that
at least one of the ribs (6) projects beyond the diameter of the tubular

nozzle, is serrated in cross-section and extends in the axial direction of the
tubular nozzle (3).
Vacuum cleaner hose according to claim 1, characterised in that at least
two ribs (6) are provided, distributed over the circumference of the tubular

nozzle (3).
Vacuum cleaner hose according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the
suction hose (2) has a corrugation (2) formed like the thread of a screw

and in that at least one additional rib (9) is provided on the outer surface of
the tubular nozzle (3) and engages internally in the corrugation (10).
Vacuum cleaner hose according to claim 1 or one of the subsequent
claims, characterised in that the additional rib (9) extends over less than a

quarter of the tubular nozzle circumference and is interrupted in the
circumferential direction.
Vacuum cleaner hose according to claim 1 or one of the subsequent
claims, characterised in that on the outer surface at least one resilient

hinge web (14) is provided, having a shank extending parallel to the axially
oriented rib (6), the clear distance of the shank from the rib (6) being

slightly smaller than the height of the corrugations (10) of the suction hose
(2). 
Vacuum cleaner hose according to claim, characterised in that on the
hinge web (14) a grip member (15) extending with clearance parallel to the

tubular nozzle (3) rests, the connecting point (16) of the hinge web (14) lying
with the grip member (15) with axial clearance from its ends, and in that the

grip member shank (15a) pointing to the free end of the tubular nozzle (3)
has a radially oriented catch lug (17) and the grip member shank (15b)

pointing to the suction hose (2) lies with radial clearance from the suction
hose (2).
Vacuum cleaner hose according to claim 1 or one of the subsequent
claims, characterised in that the axially extending ribs (6) are of different

lengths.
Vacuum cleaner hose according to claim 1 or one of the subsequent
claims, characterised in that the axially extending ribs (6) and the

additional ribs (9) extending in the circumferential direction are staggered
without overlap in the circumferential direction.
Vacuum cleaner hose according to claim 3 or one of the subsequent
claims, characterised in that the flat flanks (11) of the ribs (6) rise in the

screwing up direction of the suction hose (2).
Vacuum cleaner hose according to claim 3 or one of the subsequent
claims, characterised in that the additional ribs (9) extend with an

inclination in the circumferential direction corresponding to the pitch of the
screw thread-like corrugation (10).
