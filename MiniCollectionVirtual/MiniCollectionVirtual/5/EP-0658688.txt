<ABSTRACT>
1. Engine with a number of cylinders (1...8, 34) arranged radially about a driveshaft (10, 32), which cylinders are each respectively staggered by the same angle and the piston rods (22, 240) of which, for generating torque, effectively mesh with a control cam device (23, 26), presenting alternating concave and convex curvatures arranged on a rotor element (24), rotationally fixed to the driveshaft, the driveshaft (10, 32) forming an axis of symmetry for the control cam device (23, 26), the number of cylinders (1...8) being an even number and each pair of cylinders (1, 5 and 2, 6 and 3, 7 and 4, 8) lying respectively opposite one another in relation to the driveshaft (10, 32) performing synchronous working strokes, the reciprocating movements of the pistons (21) of each pair of cylinders (1, 5 and 2, 6 and 3, 7 and 4, 8) being in opposition and equal and the forces exerted centrally on the driveshaft (10, 32) by the pairs of cylinders (1, 5 and 2, 6 and 3, 7 and 4, 8) essentially cancelling each other out.
