Floor-covering web designed as a pile fabric for sports 
surfaces, in particular synthetic grass surfaces, with a 

supporting web (10) comprising openings and therefore being 
water-permeable, pile elements (12) secured to said 

supporting web and forming the pile as well as a plastic 
layer (14) arranged on the underside of the supporting web 

(10), said layer (14) being elastic in the direction of its 
thickness and made from an open-cell foamed plastic, 

characterized in that a storage layer (16) having 
water-storing properties and made from a fiber fleece, a 

needled felt or a heavy woven fabric is arranged on the 
underside of the plastic layer (14) and the plastic layer 

(14) is designed such that it has a pumping effect causing a 
transport of water from the storage layer (16) to the 

supporting web (10) when the floor-covering web is walked on. 
Floor-covering web as defined in claim 1, characterized in 
that the pile elements (12) have anchoring feet (12a) 

arranged on the underside of the supporting web, said feet 
being located between supporting web (10) and foamed plastic 

layer (14).  
 
Floor-covering web as defined in claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that supporting web (10), pile elements (12), foamed 

plastic layer (14) and storage layer (16) consist of the 
same plastics material. 
Floor-covering web as defined in any or several of claims 
1 - 3, characterized in that the foamed plastic layer (14) 

consists of butadiene styrene.
