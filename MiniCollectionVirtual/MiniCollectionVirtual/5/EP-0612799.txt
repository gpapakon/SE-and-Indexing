<ABSTRACT>
A 1,2-polybutadiene composition having an excellent 
reinforcing effect for rubber and synthetic resin 

materials including at least two polybutadiene components 
different in melting point from each other and each 

having, as a main structure, a 1,2-polybutadiene 
structure, produced by polymerizing a 1,3-butadiene-containing 

monomer in a water-containing polymerization 
system in the presence of a catalyst comprising a 

transition metal compound, an organic compound of one of 
the Group I to III metals, and one of carbon disulfide, 

phenyl isothiocyanate, and xanthic acid compounds, while 
adding a melting point-regulating agent comprising at 

least one of ketones, aldehydes, alcohols, esters, 
nitriles, sulfoxides, amides, and phosphoric acid esters 

in one or two or more separate adding operations or a 
continuous adding operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for producing
a polybutadiene composition comprising at least two
polybutadiene components different in melting temperature
from each other and each having, as a principal
structure, a 1,2-polybutadiene structure.The polybutadiene composition of the present
invention is useful for modifying synthetic polymeric
materials and for reinforcing rubber materials.A polybutadiene having, as a principal
structure, a 1,2-polybutadiene structure, which will be
referred to as "1,2-polybutadiene" hereinafter, has vinyl
groups located in side chains thereof and thus is
expected to be excellent in a mix-kneading property with
other polymers and elastomers. Also, it is known that
the 1,2-polybutadiene having a relatively high melting
temperature of about 150°C is generally a tenacious
resin. Accordingly, there have been attempts to obtain a
tenacious resin alloy by blending the above-mentioned
1,2-polybutadiene into various rubber or synthetic resin
materials.However, it is also known that where the
conventional 1,2-polybutadiene resin having a high
melting temperature of about 150°C is blended with rubber
or synthetic resin materials in a simple manner, a
problem occurs that the 1,2-polybutadiene resin cannot be
satisfactorily dispersed therein. EP-A-517 537 relates to physical blends of such polymers. Further, when a
conventional 1,2-polybutadiene resin having a relatively
low melting temperature of from about 100°C to about
120°C is blended into a different type of polymer, there 
occurs a problem that the reinforcing effect of the 1,2-polybutadiene
resin is unsatisfactory.An object of the present invention is to solve the
above-mentioned problems of the conventional 1,2-polybutadiene
resins and to provide a process for producing a novel 1,2-polybutadiene
composition having a high reinforcing
effect for rubber and synthetic resin materials.The above-mentioned object can be attained by the process for
producing the novel polybutadiene composition of the present invention
comprising at least two polybutadiene components
different in melting temperature from each other and each
having, as a principal structure, a 1,2-polybutadiene
structure.In the polybutadiene composition,
each polybutadiene component preferably
consists essentially of a polybutadiene composed of a
syndiotactic 1,2-structure.In the polybutadiene composition,
among the at least two polybutadiene
components different in melting temperature from each
other, the component having the highest melting
temperature
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A process for producing a polybutadiene composition,
comprising at least two

polybutadiene components different from each other in
melting temperature and each having a syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene

structure in an amount of at least 75 molar%
the lowest one of these melting temperatures being in the

range of from 105°C to 155°C, and the highest one of these
melting temperatures being at least 155°C, wherein

the process comprises suspension-polymerizing 1,3-butadiene monomer in
a polymerization mixture containing water and a catalyst

comprising (a) an aging product of at least one transition
metal compound and at least one organic compound of the

Groups I to III metals mixed with a conjugated diene
selected from 1,3-butadiene, isoprene and myrcene, and (b)

at least one member selected from carbon disulfide, phenyl
isothiocyanate and xanthic acid compounds,

   wherein

(1) 1,3-butadiene is suspension-polymerized
to such an extent that a conversion of 1,3-butadiene

to 1,2-polybutadiene reaches a level of from 5 to
65% by weight,

   and then

(2) a melting temperature-regulating
agent comprising at least one member selected from ketones,

aldehydes, alcohols, esters, nitriles, sulfoxides, amides
and phosphoric acid esters is added to the polymerization

mixture containing the highest melting temperature
polybutadiene component in an amount of 5 to 65% by weight 

based on the total weight of the resultant polybutadiene
composition to thereby provide a polybutadiene composition

where the difference in melting temperature between the high
melting temperature 1,2-polybutadiene component and the low

melting temperature 1,2 polybutadiene component is in a
range of from 20°C to 125°C.
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein of the at least
two polybutadiene components different in melting

temperature from each other, the component having the
highest melting temperature is dispersed in a matrix

consisting of the other component or components.
The process as claimed in claim 2, wherein the dispersed
polybutadiene component having the highest melting

temperature is in the form of fine grains, scales, flakes,
or short fibers.
