<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns filters that remove particulates from streams 
of hot gases such as from exhausts of fossil fuel furnaces, coal-gasification plants, 
and internal combustion engines. The invention is especially concerned with the 
need to remove particulate matter from exhausts of diesel engines. As part of a worldwide effort to protect the environment, concerted 
efforts are underway to reduce the quantity of soot and other particulate matter 
emitted into the atmosphere by the burning of fossil fuels. For example, 
particulate emissions from coal-burning furnaces, e.g., of electric power plants, 
have long been a primary cause of environmental concern. Efforts also are being 
made to reduce the emission of soot from the exhausts of diesel engines and 
coal-gasification plants. It is known that soot can be removed from hot exhaust gases by 
passing such gases through filter fabrics. One such filter fabric, as disclosed in 
coassigned U.S. Pat. No. 4,543,113 (Forester et al.), is made from a woven 
ceramic fiber which maintains its integrity for prolonged periods at temperatures 
up to at least 1150°C and for at least short periods up to at least 1400°C. This 
filter fabric preferably is employed as a seamless, tubular filter which can be 
cleaned periodically by a reverse purge of air. Also illustrated is a flat filter 
having a flat piece of the fabric supported in a frame. Preferably, the ceramic 
fiber fabric comprises continuous alumina-boria-silica fibers (such as are sold 
under the trademark NEXTEL™ 312 from the 3M Company). Although little used commercially to date, a variety of diesel 
particulate traps have been described in the prior art. Most employ a plurality of  
 
rigid, perforated hollow tubes on which ceramic yarn is wound. In 
Offenlegungsschrift No. DE 37 31 766 (Buck), laid open 30 Mar 1989, perforated 
tubes are covered with a knitted sleeve of ceramic yarn of alumina-boria-silica 
fibers or wound with a length of the knitted fabric or, as shown in Fig. 11, a 
spirally wound length of the knitted fabric is stuffed into a canister. In some diesel particulate traps, the perforated hollow tubes extend 
side-by-side, and in others, the tubes are concentric. Side-by-side, rigid, 
perforated hollow tubes (called "support pipes") are shown in U.S. Pat. No. 
4,324,572 (Erdmannsdoerfer). There, threads of spun silicon dioxide or silica 
fiber are wound on each of the tubes to provide filtering elements. Each tube is 
blocked at the exhaust inlet, while channels between the tubes are

A fabric (12) useful for filtering particulate matter from a stream of 
hot gases, which fabric (12) is characterized by an unknotted weave of
 
   flexible, substantially incompressible, substantially uncrimped, spaced 

support strands (14) and
 
   flexible, lofty, substantially fully crimped fill yarns (16) which are 

pulled tightly against said support strands (14). 
The fabric (12) of claim 1 wherein each of said support strands (14) 
is uniformly spaced from adjacent support strands (14) by from 0.1 to 3 times the 

nominal diameter of said fill yarns (16), wherein said support strands (14) are 
yarns, said support yarns (14) comprising from 2 to 6 intertwisted bundles of from 

3 to 8 intertwisted ends, and wherein said bundles of ends have from 0.4 to 3 
twists/cm in opposite directions. 
The fabric (12) of claim 1 or 2 wherein each of said support strands 
(14) and fill yarns (16) are primarily ceramic. 
The fabric (12) of claim 1 or 2 wherein said support strands (14) 
and fill yarns (16) comprise glass. 
The fabric (12) of any preceding claim wherein said support strands 
(14) or said fill yarns (16) comprise electrically resistive material. 
The fabric (12) of any preceding claim wherein said lofty fill yarns 
(16) comprise texturized continuous-filament yarns, and loops of continuous 

filaments extend outwardly from the main body of each of said yarns (16), said fill 
yarns (16) being flattened at each support strand (14) to less than one-fifth their 

nominal diameter.  
 
The fabric (12) of any preceding claim wherein individual ends of 
fill yarns (16) have less than 2 twists/m, and their ends are twisted 
together at no 
more than one twist/cm. 
The fabric (12) of any preceding claim wherein said weave of 
support strands (14) and fill yarns (16) have differing degrees of openness. 
A diesel particulate trap (20) comprising at least one rigid, 
perforated hollow tube (27, 29) that is open at one end and closed at the other, 

which tube (27, 29) is overwrapped with said tube (27, 29) overwrapped with a 
plurality of layers (12A, 12B, 12C) of said filtering fabric (12) as defined in any 

preceding claim, and said support strands (14) of each layer (12A, 12B, 12C) 
extending orthogonally to those of adjacent layers (12A, 12B, 12C). 
A filter (20) comprising a plurality of layers (12A, 12B, 12C) of 
filtering fabric as defined in claims 1 to 8, with said support yarns (14) of each 

layer (12A, 12B, 12C) extending orthogonally to those of adjacent layers (12A, 
12B, 12C), said layers (12A, 12B, 12C) being superimposed and convolutely 

wound together.
