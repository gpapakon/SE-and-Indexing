<ABSTRACT>
A method of producing a high-formable, high-strength 
cold-rolled steel sheet from a steel slab comprising a steel 

with very low carbon content, one or both of Ti and Nb as a 
composition for forming a carbide or a nitride, and B in the 

range satisfying the following expression:


0.001 A ≦ B (wt%) ≦ 0.003 A 



 
wherein A is a parameter determined approximately by the 

following expression with reference to the relation:


A = P (wt %) + 0.2 Mn (wt %) + 0.8 Si (wt %) - 0.2 
 
,



 
subjecting the steel to a hot rolling so as to finish at a 

temperature between about Ar₃ transformation temperature and 
about Ar₃ transformation temperature + 100 C°. Thereafter, 

the steel is successively subjected to coiling, cold-rolling 
and, then, continuous annealing at temperatures between Ac₁ 

transformation temperature + 5 C° and Ac₁ transformation 
temperature + 50 C°, and not lower than 860 C°. Thus, a 

volume percentage of a low temperature transformation phase 
is controlled within the range of about 5 to about 50 %, 

thereby obtaining a high strength cold-rolled steel sheet 
having a tensile strength of 38 kgf/mm² or more, plus 

excellent formability and resistance to secondary working 
embrittlement.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for
manufacturing a high formable, high strength cold-rolled
steel sheet excellent in resistance to secondary working
embrittlement.The prior art concerning high-strength cold-rolled
steel sheet is extensive. High-strength cold-rolled
steel sheet consists of a base steel which is fully
decarburized during manufacturing, producing a very low
carbon content. To secure formability, C and N dissolved
in the base steel are fixed as carbides or nitrides by
Ti, Nb, or other fixing elements contained therein. The
base steel also comprises dissolved strengthening
compositions of Si, P, Mn, etc. to improve strength.For example, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication
No. 63-190141 discloses a cold-rolled steel sheet in
which Mn and P are added to Ti-containing steel with very
low carbon content as described above. In such a cold-rolled
steel sheet, adding suitable amounts of Mn and P
causes a small amount of dissolved carbon to remain after 
annealing of the steel sheet, thereby significantly
increasing the r-value of the sheet, i.e. Rankford value
which is a measure of formability. Additionally,
secondary working embrittlement is avoided due to the
dissolved carbon remaining at a grain boundary. However,
when large amounts of P are added to the above-described
steel to produce greater steel strength, resistance to
secondary working embrittlement is significantly
deteriorated.The addition of B is well known for improving the
resistance of steel to secondary working embrittlement.
However, steel sheet to which large amounts of solid-solution
strengthening compositions are added tends to
become embrittled by those same solid-solution
strengthening compositions. Therefore, large amounts of
B are required to ensure efficient resistance to
secondary working embrittlement. When excessive amounts
of B are added, however, formability and hot rolling
properties of the steel tend to deteriorate.In Japanese Patent Publication No. 59-42742, there
is proposed a steel to which Si is added as a solid-solution
strengthening composition in addition to Mn and
P, and B is added to improve resistance to secondary
working embrittlement so as to produce a high strength
steel with a high r-value. The yield ratio of this cold
rolled steel sheet is a very low 60 % or less. However, 
we discovered that when the tensile strength of this high
strength cold-rolled steel sheet exceeds 40 kgf/mm2,
containing solid-solution elements such as Si, Mn and P
and having a ferrite single phase structure, it is
