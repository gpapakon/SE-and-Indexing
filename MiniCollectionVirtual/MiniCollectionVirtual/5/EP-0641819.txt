<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for the preparation of an organosilicon polymer that contains the silalkylenesiloxane
unit that is free of depolymerization and capable of high yields.Because organosilicon polymers that contain the silalkylenesiloxane unit of the general formula

in which
R = monovalent hydrocarbon group a =positive integer
are less susceptible to molecular chain scission by ionic substances (e.g., acids, alkalis, and so forth), they are currently
under investigation for utilization in various specialized applications. The ring-opening polymerization of cyclic silalkylenesiloxane
is known for the synthesis of said silalkylenesiloxane unit-containing organosilicon polymers. The prior
art is represented by Japanese Patent Publications 4-65428 and 4-65429, and Izvestiya Akademii Nauk SSSR, Seriya
Khimicheskaya, No. 4, 739-744, April, 1971).The methods taught in the above publications require the preliminary synthesis of a cyclic silalkylenesiloxane such
as 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-oxa-2,6-disilacyclohexane. However, these cyclic silalkylenesiloxanes are quite difficult to synthesize.
Moreover, as reported in the article in Izvestiya Akademii Nauk SSSR, a partial depolymerization of the polysilalkylenesiloxane
occurs, which leads to a substantial reduction in the yield of the organosilicon polymer.EP-A 0 539 065 describes a process for the preparation of an organosiloxane copolymer comprising the reaction
of an α,Ω-trisne, eg 1,5,9-decatriene, and a dihydroorganosiloxane, eg 1,1,3,3-tetramethyldisiloxane, in the presence
of a platinum catalyst. The yield of the organosiloxane copolymer obtained is on the average only about 90%.From Methoden der Organischen Chemie: "Organo-Silicium-Verbindungen", Band XIII/5, 20.11.1980, Thieme,
Stuttgart, DE, pages 328 to 329, the copolymerization of methylphenylsilane with HC≡C-(CH2)3-C≡CH in the presence
of hexachloroplatinic acid and furthermore the polymerisation of ethyl-(4-methyl-phenyl)-[propine-(2)-yl]-silane is
known.The present invention introduces a method for the preparation of a silalkylenesiloxane unit-containing organosilicon
polymer that is free of depolymerization and capable of high yields.The present invention relates to a method for the preparation of an organosilicon polymer having the general
formula

wherein R1 denotes a C1 - C10 monovalent hydrocarbon group that is free of aliphatic unsaturation; R2 denotes a C2
alkylene group; R3 is hydrogen atom, a vinyl group, or hydroxyl group; m is an integer having a value
of zero or
