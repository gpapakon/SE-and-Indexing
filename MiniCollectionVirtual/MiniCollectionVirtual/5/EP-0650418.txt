<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a sliding or roller shutter or door (1) which consists of a plurality of generally similar lathes or planks (2) hinged together by elastomeric members (6) attached to adjacent edges (5) of the lathes or planks. Preferably the edges (5) of the lathes or planks are formed with longitudinally extending key-hole shape slots (4), and the elastomeric hinge members are formed with opposite enlarged portions (7) received in the slots (4) in the lathes or planks.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to sliding shutters, 
particularly, but not exclusively, for use as doors for the 
load carrying compartments of commercial motor vehicles. It is well known to provide a roller or 'up and over' 
shutter or door for closing a commercial vehicle body such 
as a van or truck body in the form of a vertically sliding 
member consisting of a series of planks or laths made, for 
example, of aluminium or plywood which are hinged together 
and which are guided at their ends in suitable tracks in 
the vehicle body. Similar shutters are used for closing 
commercial premises and to improve the security of domestic 
premises. DE-A-1 530 720 of Fruehauf Corp. discloses a sliding 
shutter comprising a plurality of laths, each having opposed 
faces bounded by edges, the laths being hinged together by 
elastomeric members attached to adjacent edges of the 
laths, wherein the mutually adjacent edges of the laths are 
formed with longitudinally extending key-hole shape slots 
and the elastomeric members are formed with opposite 
enlarged portions received in the slots in the laths, the 
arrangement being such that the elastomeric members are 
tensioned under gravity due to the weight of the laths to 
provide a positive seal between the laths and to preclude 
rattling of the laths. It is an object of the invention to provide an  
 
improved sliding or roller shutter or door. The accompanying claims define a sliding or roller 
shutter or door according to the invention : Claim 1 defines such a 
shutter of the type disclosed in DE-A-1 530 720 and having all the features recited in claim 1. 
Further developments in line with claim 1 are referred to in the 
dependent claims 2 to 7.  
 The invention is diagrammatically illustrated, by way 
of example, in the accompanying drawings, in which:- 
Figure 1 is a perspective view of an 'up and over' 
shutter door for a commercial motor vehicle body; Figure 2 is a cross-section through a shutter lath; Figures 3a and 3b are scrap cross-sectional views of 
a pair of laths of the kind shown in Figure 2, and showing 
their manner of interconnection and articulation; Figure 4 is a scrap plan view of a shutter showing its 
associated guide members, and Figure 5 is a scrap end view of a shutter showing how 
the guide members are received in a guide channel or track. In the drawings, an 'up and over' shutter door for a 
commercial motor vehicle body is shown which is 
conventional in its general arrangement and consisting of 
a sliding shutter 1 formed by a series of
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A sliding shutter (1), comprising a plurality of laths 
(2), each having opposed faces (9) bounded by edges (5), the 

laths being hinged together by elastomeric members (6) 
attached to adjacent edges (5) of the laths, wherein the 

mutually adjacent edges (5) of the laths (2) are formed 
with longitudinally extending key-hole shape slots (4) and 

the elastomeric members (6) are formed with opposite 
enlarged portions (7) received in the slots (4) in the 

laths, characterised in that the slots (4) are formed 
between the lath faces (9) and the lath edges (5) to extend 

obliquely to the faces (9) and edges (5) such that the 
elastomeric members (6) are tensioned when the laths (2) 

are co-planar, such as when the shutter (1) is closed, to 
cause the mutually adjacent edges (5) of the laths (2) to 

be pulled together and such that hinging the laths (2) away 
from the co-planar causes a reduction in the tension of the 

elastomeric members (6). 
A shutter according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the elastomeric members (6) are of constant cross-section 

and in that the opposite enlarged portions (7) are joined 
by a web (8). 
A shutter according to claim 2, characterised in that 
the elastomeric members (6) are dumb-bell shaped in cross-section. 
A shutter according to any preceding claim, 
characterised in that the elastomeric members (6) extend 

along the full lengths of the laths (2).  
 
A shutter according to any preceding claim, 
characterised in that the laths (2) are formed from a high 

impact plastics, such as UPVC. 
A shutter according to any preceding claim, 
characterised in that the laths (2) have hollow interiors 

(11). 
A shutter according to claim 6, characterised in that 
the hollow interiors (11) of the laths (2) are filled with 

a thermally insulating material.
