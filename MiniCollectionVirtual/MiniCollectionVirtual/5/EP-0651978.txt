<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a brush for personal hygiene
purposes more particularly, but not exclusively, to a
toothbrush.Power driven toothbrushes, for example, electric
toothbrushes, have been proposed in which either a
toothbrush head or the bristles protruding therefrom are
driven to move in a reciprocally rotational manner.It is a disadvantage of the such proposed toothbrushes that
the transmission from a power means to the toothbrush head
to drive this in reciprocal motion is generally complicated
and thus expensive to manufacture.US 2598275 discloses the features of the preamble of claim 1. In this power driven toothbrush
a linearly reciprocable shaft is driven by a motor,
the shaft being connected off centre to a rotatable brush
head. A biasing spring is used to prevent the shaft lying
in a dead centre position.It is the object of the invention to provide an improved 
powerable brush for personal hygiene purposes.According to the invention there is provided a brush for
personal hygiene purposes comprising a rotatably mounted
brush head, a connection member for connection to a linear
reciprocal drive means and a member disposed between the
connection member and the brush head and for converting
linear reciprocal motion of the connection member to
rotational motion of the head, characterized in that said
member disposed between the connection member and the brush
head is a flexible member which is biased in a direction
laterally away from the direction of linear reciprocal
motion of the connection member.With an arrangement of this type, complicated gearing
arrangements for converting the reciprocal motion of the
connection member to rotational movement of the brush head
are not needed, thus simplifying the construction of the
brush.Preferably the flexible member is formed from metal wire.In a further preferred form, the flexible member is
provided with a loop which is arranged to move in
reciprocation with the connection member in a channel, the
edges of the loop contacting the sides of the channel to 
support that portion of the flexible member.In a preferred embodiment the brush comprises: a main body;
a detachable head part having the rotatably mounted brush
head thereon; a driven member connected to the linear
reciprocal drive means in said main body; and coupling
means provided on said driven member and on said connection
member to provide a releasable coupling therebetween, said
coupling means being adapted to provide coupling between
said members, when the head part is in a first

<CLAIMS>
A brush for personal hygiene purposes comprising a
main body and a head having a rotatably mounted brush

head (100), a connection member (150) for connection
to a linear reciprocal drive means, and a member (160,

360) disposed between the connection member (150) and
the brush head (100) for converting linear reciprocal

motion of the connection member to rotational motion
of the brush head, characterized in that said member

(160, 360) disposed between the connection member and
the brush head is a flexible member (160, 360) which

is biased in a direction laterally away from the
direction of linear reciprocal motion of the

connection member (150).
A brush as claimed in claim 1 where in the flexible
member (160, 360) is formed from metal wire.
A brush as claimed in claim 1 or 2 wherein the
flexible member (160, 360) is in the form of wire

or ribbon.
A brush as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3 wherein

the connection member reciprocates in a channel formed
in a support (110). 
A brush as claimed in claim 4 wherein the flexible
member (360) is bent to have a loop (362) therein.
A brush as claimed in claim 5 wherein the loop (362)
contacts sides of the channel in the support (110).
A brush as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims further comprising a stop (366) for

limiting movement of the connection member.
A brush as claimed in any one of the preceding claims
wherein the brush head comprises a circular base (102)

from which a plurality of bristles (104) project, the
base having first means (106) for receiving a pivot

and second radially offset means (112) for receiving
an end of the flexible member (160, 360).
A brush as claimed in any one of the preceding claims
further comprising means for moving the connection

member reciprocally, including drive means (200) for
driving a cam, the cam comprising a circular member

(216) offset relative to a driving axis, the circular
member being held for rotation in a follower (220)

connectable to the connection member (150).
A brush as claimed in claim 9 wherein the circular 
member (216) is connected to an annular rack (214)

engagable by a gear connected to the drive means
(200).
A brush as claimed in claim 9 or 10 wherein the
follower (220) is connected to a linearly guided

member (222) via a pivot, the linearly guided member
(222) being connectable to the connection member

(150).
A brush as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,
being a powered toothbrush.
A brush as claimed in claim 8 wherein the base (102)
is provided with a central upstanding protrusion (404,

406) having a free end which lies below ends of the
bristles.
A brush as claimed in claim 13 wherein the central
upstanding protrusion is at least partly formed of a

soft resilient material (406).
A brush as claimed in any preceding claim comprising:

a main body (502);
a detachable head part (508) with the rotatably
mounted brush head (100) thereon; 
a driven member (222) connected to the linear
reciprocal drive means in said main body; and
coupling means provided on said driven member (222)
and on said connection member (150) to provide a

releasable coupling therebetween, said coupling means

A brush as claimed in claim 15 wherein the main body
(502) and head part (508) are provided with engagement

means (509, 513, 515) to allow these to be push-fitted
together or pulled apart when the head part is in the

first orientation, and when fitted, rotated to the
second orientation in which the head part is prevented

from release.
