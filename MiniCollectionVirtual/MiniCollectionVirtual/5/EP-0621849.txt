<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to arrangements for 
holding a plurality of cans. Multipacks of cans are well known for drinks 
and foodstuffs. Cans of drink are often sold in 
multipacks utilising a plastic ring having a number of 
apertures for receiving a corresponding number of 
cans. This number is often four or six. It is 
however desirable to cease using plastic in such 
multipacks. Attempts have been made to produce 
satisfactory paperboard alternatives to the plastic 
ring but the alternatives tend to be of an all 
encompassing nature or sleeve-like. According to a first aspect of the present 
invention there is provided a package for a plurality 
of cans, said package comprising first means which for 
each can has a top section and integral means for 
gripping each can below the top rim, said gripping 
means being arranged in an array such that each can is 
in substantially touching relation with all 
immediately adjacent cans (see for instance US-A-3 118 537), and characterized by second means having a 
top panel for attachment to said first means and side 
panel means for extending all around the periphery of 
the plurality of cans, said side panel means 
comprising one or more side panels hinged downwardly 
relative to said top panel, one or more of said side 
panels in contact with the cans and having one or more 
portions extending around one or more of said cans 
for attachment to at least one of said side panels. Preferably said first and second means are 
made from paperboard. The first means is ideally made 
from a single piece of paperboard which constitutes 
all said top sections and gripping means. 
Conveniently each gripping means comprises a pair of 
spaced arcuate cuts between which the top of a can is  
 
disposed, the paperboard adjacent the cuts being 
pressed down under the rim of the can so as to grip 
the can below the rim. In preferred arrangements the array may be 
generally rectangular, for example a 2x2, 2x3 or 2x4 
array of cans, by virtue of the gripping means being 
arranged in a suitable array. The top panel is preferably generally 
rectangular in plan view and four side panels are 
provided. In one arrangement an opposite pair of side 
panels, each has a pair of oppositely extending 
extensions which are, in use, bent around the adjacent 
corner can of the rectangular array such that each 
side panel of the other pair of opposite side panels 
is attached to two extensions, one from each of the 
first pair of side walls. Ideally the top panel of the second means 
incorporate

<CLAIMS>
A package (12) for a plurality of cans (11), said 
package comprising first means (13) which for 

each can (11) has a top section (16) and integral 
means (15) for gripping each can below the top 

rim, said gripping means (15) being arranged in 
an array such that each can (11) is in 

substantially touching relation with all 
immediately adjacent cans, and characterized by second means (14) 

having a top panel (23) for attachment to said 
first means (13) and side panel means for 

extending all around the periphery of the 
plurality of cans, said side panel means 

comprising one or more side panels (25,26,27,28) 
hinged downwardly relative to said top panel 

(23), one or more of said side panels in contact 
with the cans and having one or more portions 

(33,34,35,36) extending around one or more of 
said cans for attachment to at least one of said 

side panels (25,26,27,28). 
A package as claimed in claim 1 wherein said 
first and second means (13,14) are made from 

paperboard. 
A package as claimed in claim 2 wherein the first 
means (13) is made from a single piece of 

paperboard which constitutes all said top 
sections (16) and gripping means (15). 
A package as claimed in claim 2 or claim 3 
wherein each gripping means comprises a pair of 

spaced arcuate cuts (15) between which the top of 
a can is disposed, the paperboard adjacent the 

cuts being pressed down under the rim of the can  
 

so as to grip the can below the rim. 
A package as claimed in claim 4 wherein the array 
is rectangular. 
A package as claimed in claim 5 wherein the top 
panel (23) is generally rectangular and four side 

panels (25,26,27,28) are hingedly connected to 
the top panel (23). 
A package as claimed in claim 6 wherein each of a 
pair of oppositely disposed side panels (25,27) 

has a pair of oppositely extending extensions 
(33-36) which are, in use, bent around the 

adjacent corner can of the rectangular array such 
that each side panel (26,28) of the other pair of 

side panels is attached to two extensions, one 
from each of the first pair of side panels. 
A package as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 7 
wherein the top panel (23) incorporates one or 

more formations (24) to facilitate the picking up 
of the package. 
A package as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 8 
wherein adhesive is used to secure all the top 

sections (16) of the first means to the top panel 
(23) of the second means and to secure the side 

panel means around the cans. 
A pair of blanks for holding a plurality of cans, 
the first blank (13) having a number of pairs of 

spaced, oppositely disposed arcuate cuts 
(15) for receiving a corresponding number of 

cans (11) so as, in use, to hold the cans in an 
array such that each can is in substantially 

touching relation with all immediately adjacent 
cans and characterized in that the second blank (14) provides a top 

panel (23) and one or more side panel means (25-28)  
 

hingedly connected thereto for extending all 
around the periphery of the plurality of cans, 

one or more of which side panel means (25,27) 
comprises one or more extension portions (33-36) 

which, in use, extend all around one or more of 
said cans in contact therewith for attachment to 

one of said side panels (26-28). 
A pair of blanks as claimed in claim 10 wherein 
the pairs of cuts (15) are arranged in a 

rectangular array so as to secure a rectangular 
array of cans. 
A pair of blanks as claimed in claim 11 wherein 
the two ends of each cut (15) are located on a 

straight hinge line (17). 
A pair of blanks as claimed in claim 12 wherein 
between pairs of cuts is a reverse hinge line 

(20) parallel to said straight hinge lines (17). 
A pair of blanks as claimed in any one of claims 
10 to 13 wherein the top panel (23) is generally 

rectangular and there are four corresponding side 
panels (25-28), each side panel (25,27) of one 

opposite pair of side panels having lateral 
extensions (33-36) at both sides. 
A pair of blanks as claimed in claim 14 wherein 
the other pair of side panels (26,28) each

between the side panel and the top panel. 
A pair of blanks as claimed in claim 15 wherein 
arcuate cuts (20) are provided in the sub-panels 

(40,41) for receiving the can rims.
