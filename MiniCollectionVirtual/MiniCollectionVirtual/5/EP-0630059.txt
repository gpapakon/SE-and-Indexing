<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a
superconducting apparatus in which an element that exhibits
the superconducting phenomenon and a cooling element are
combined together.As is conventionally known, the superconducting
phenomenon that certain types of conductive materials, when
cryogenically cooled, show zero electric resistance appears
when, for example, lead or a niobium alloy is cooled to
cryogenic temperature around the liquid helium temperature.
Accordingly, when such a superconducting phenomenon is
applied to switching devices or high-sensitivity sensor
devices, a high-speed, high-sensitivity operation can be
implemented without causing any power loss to a greatly
remarkable advantage. On the other hand, however, there
arises a need of cooling such devices to cryogenic
temperatures. In such cases, the devices must be used as
they are accommodated in a cooling unit, so called
cryostat, using liquid helium and liquid nitrogen. The 
cooling unit, being large, complex, and expensive,
makes a great obstacle to the practicability of the
superconducting systems. At present, this problem has
not yet been solved, so that the superconducting
phenomenon is not widely or commonly used as it
stands.In recent years, there have emerged oxide
materials one after another that exhibit a new
superconducting phenomenon. It is expected that the
use of these materials will allow superconducting
apparatus to be provided at low temperatures closer to
room temperature.However, even if these materials are used, it is
indispensable to add cooling means capable of
substantially low temperature cooling, in order to
make a superconducting phenomenon occur with good
reproducibility and thereby impart high reliability to
the apparatus. As a result, the whole apparatus would
be large in size and high in price.To solve the above problems, one of the present
inventors invented the superconducting apparatus
disclosed in EP-A-0 288 022, in which a
superconducting element is disposed on a cooling
portion of a Peltier effect element and accommodated
in a container.In the aforementioned patent application, it is 
also proposed that the container interior be sealed by
an inert gas atmosphere. In this case, indeed the
device reliability is improved by sealing with the
inert gas, but the container is cooled due to the
presence of the inert gas. It would therefore be the
actual case, for example, that the cooling efficiency
is deteriorated or that moisture in air condenses as
dew to stick to the container, disadvantageously.The present
