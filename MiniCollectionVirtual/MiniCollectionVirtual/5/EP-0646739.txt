<ABSTRACT>
A rod or piston seal with a sealing body (1) made of polymeric material which touches the surface (2) capable of executing relative displacement and requiring sealing with a sealing surface (3) which is interrupted in the direction of motion (4) by at least two grooves (5.1, 5.2, ...) which extend in the circumferential direction and exhibit a spacing (6) with respect to one another. The spacing (6) is formed by at least one web (7), which extends in the axial direction between the adjacent grooves (5.1, 5.2, ...), the ratio A of the width (11) of the web (7) and the width (10) of the grooves (5.1, 5.2, ...) in the direction of motion (4) being from 1:2 to 200:1, the ratio B of the width (10) and the depth (17) of the grooves (5.1, 5.2, ...) being from 10:1 to 1:5, and the depth (17) of the grooves (5.1, 5.2, ...) being from 1 to 200  mu m.

A rod or piston seal having a seal body (1) made 
of a polymer material which touches with a sealing surface 

(3) the relatively displaceable surface (2) to be sealed 
off, the sealing surface (3) being interrupted in the 

direction of movement by at least two grooves (5.1, 5.2, 
...) extending in the circumferential direction and having 

a spacing (6) from one another, the said spacing (6) being 
formed by at least one web (7) which extends in the axial 

direction between the grooves (5.1, 5.2, ...) adjacent to 
one another, characterized in that the ratio A of the width 

(11) of the web (7) and the width (10) of the grooves (5.1, 
5.2, ...) is 1:2 to 200:1 in the direction of movement (4), 

in that the ratio B of the width (10) and the depth (17) 
of the grooves ( 5.1, 5.2, ...) is 10:1 to 1:5, and in 

that the depth (17) of the grooves (5.1, 5.2, ...) has a 
value of 1 to 200 µm. 
A rod or piston seal according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the ratio A is 1.5:1 to 30:1, in that 

the ratio B is 2.1:1 to 3.8:1, and in that the depth (17) 
has a value of 7 to 35 µm. 
A rod or piston seal according to either of claims 
1 and 2, characterized in that the grooves (5.1, 5.2, ...) 

adjacent to one another in the axial direction have 
differing cross-sectional shapes and sizes and/or differing 

spacings (6) from one another. 
A rod or piston seal according to any of claims 1 
to 3, characterized in that the grooves (5.1, 5.2, ...) are 

formed concentrically, and in that the sealing surface (3) 
includes at least ten grooves (5.1, 5.2, ...). 
A rod or piston seal according to any of claims 1 
to 4, characterized in that, owing to the manufacturing 

process, the web (7) of the sealing surface (3) encloses an 
angle (8) with the relatively displaceable surface (2), 

which angle is from 1° to 10°, preferably from 2° to 5°, and 
'in that the angle (8) is open in the direction of the space 

(16) to be sealed off.  
 
A rod or piston seal according to any of claims 1 
to 5, characterized in that the grooves (5.1, 5.2, ...) are 

arranged on the sealing surface (3) of a groove ring, a lip 
seal or an O-ring seal. 
A rod or piston seal according to any of claims 1 
to 6, characterized in that the grooves (5.1, 5.2, ...) have 

a profile which merges in a rounded manner into the web (7) 
of the sealing surface (3). 
A rod or piston seal according to any of 
claims 1 to 7, characterized in that the grooves (5.1, 

5.2, ...) have a substantially trapezoidal profile. 
A rod or piston seal according to claim 8, 
characterized in that the axial boundary surfaces of the 

trapezoidal profile enclose an angle (12) of from 20° to 
85°, preferably from 50° to 70°, with the surface (2) to be 

sealed off. 
A rod or piston seal according to any of claims 
1 to 9, characterized in that the grooves (5.1, 5.2, ...) 

are produced by acting on the sealing surface (3) of the 
sealing body (1) with the aid of a laser beam (9). 
The use of the rod or piston seal according to 
any of claims 1 to 10 as a brake sleeve of a brake cylinder 

in a hydraulic brake system.
