<DESCRIPTION>
The priority of US provisional application 60/091,490 is claimed under
35 USC 119(e).This invention relates to organic materials useful in the fabrication
and assembly of electronic circuit components and printed wire boards.The complementary components to active microelectronic conductive
circuits are resistors, capacitors, and inductors, known as passive
components. These components, both the active circuits and the passives,
are supported and interconnected on printed wire boards (PWB) in
microelectronic devices.While the integration of active circuit functions using silicon integrated
circuits has been a major success, the integration of passive components is
still in the developmental stage. Many of the passive components remain
discrete, individual components, and often exceed in number by an order of
magnitude the number of active integrated circuits on PWBs. This has
increased the complexity of the PWBs and decreased the available surface
area for other devices. The only alternative in the past has been to increase
the size of the printed wire boards.More recent advances in circuit board design provide for planar
components formed on layers of the printed wire board, or for components 
buried in recesses in the board, resulting in a higher packaging efficiency.
This integration of passive components reduces the number of electrical
contacts or transitions between the active and passive components, which
provides a consequent improvement in electrical performance and a reduction
in mechanical stress at these transition points.The utilization of integral passive components would be particularly
advantageous in thin-film packages, and there is a significant effort within the
industry to develop organic materials that will function reliably as passive
components in microelectronic devices, particularly for thin-film packages.
Moreover, as it is expensive to discard printed wire boards, it would be a
manufacturing advantage to have an organic material that can be
reworked.In order to achieve the required mechanical performance and
desired reworkability, relatively high molecular weight thermoplastics
would be-the preferred compositions. These materials, however, have
high viscosity or even a solid film form, which are drawbacks to the
manufacturing process.Today, one of the primary thrusts within the semiconductor
industry is to develop suitable materials for passive components, and
particularly materials that would be reworkable.This invention is a curable composition for fabricating electronic
circu
