<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to herbicides, and more 
particularly to N-acyl-N-phenylmaleamic acid derivatives 
which are novel compounds, to methods of producing the 
same and to herbicides containing the same as the 
effective components. N-acyl-N-phenylmaleamic acid 
derivatives of the present invention exhibit excellent 
herbicidal activity. The derivatives are useful as a 
herbicide which can be widely applied to upland, paddy 
field, orchard, pasture, turf, forest, non-crop land, etc. 
The derivatives are not harmful to crops. Hitherto, herbicidal activity of maleamic acid 
derivatives has not been reported in large numbers. It is an object of the present invention to provide 
N-acyl-N-phenylmaleamic acid derivatives as novel 
compounds exhibiting excellent herbicidal activity against 
various very harmful weeds and not being harmful to crops, 
methods of producing the same and herbicides containing 
the same as the effective components. The inventors have found that novel maleamic acid 
derivatives each having a specific substituent acyl group 
or substituent aryl group bonded to an amide nitrogen atom 
are very excellent in herbicidal activity, selectivity and 
herbicidal spectrum, and completed the present invention. The present invention provides N-acyl-N-phenylmaleamic 
acid derivatives represented by the general  
 
formula [I], methods of producing the same, and herbicides 
containing the same as the effective components: 
wherein X and Y each individually represent hydrogen atoms 
or halogen atoms, R¹ represents a hydrogen atom, a halogen 
atom, a lower alkyl group, a lower alkenyl group, a lower 
alkynyl group, a lower alkoxyalkyl group or a lower 
alkoxycarbonylalkyl group, R² represents a lower alkyl 
group, a halogenated lower alkyl group or a substituted or 
unsubstituted phenyl group, R³ represents a hydrogen atom 
or a lower alkyl group, and R⁴ represents a hydroxyl, a 
lower alkoxy group, a lower alkenyloxy group, a lower 
alkynyloxy group, a lower alkoxyalkoxy group, a benzyloxy 
group or a lower alkoxycarbonylalkoxy group. N-acyl-N-phenylmaleamic acid derivatives [I] as 
compounds of the present invention can be synthesized for 
example, by the following methods. N-acyl-N-phenylmaleamic acid derivatives [I] which 
are compounds of the present invention can be synthesized 
by reacting imidoylchloride derivatives represented by the 
general formula [II] with carboxylic acids represented by 
the general formula [III], without using any solvent or in 
a suitable solvent such as
