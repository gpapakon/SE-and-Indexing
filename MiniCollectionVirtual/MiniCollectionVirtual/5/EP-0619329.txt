<ABSTRACT>
Water-dilutable dispersions of acrylate copolymers having a hydroxyl number of from 40 to 200 mg of KOH/g and an acid number of from 15 to 50 mg of KOH/g, obtained by free-radical copolymerization of   a) from 5 to 40 parts by weight of at least one glycidyl ester of an aliphatic, saturated monocarboxylic acid which is branched in the alpha -position, b) from 0 to 30 parts by weight of at least one diester of an  alpha , beta -olefinically unsaturated dicarboxylic acid, c) from 0 to 70 parts by weight of at least one vinyl aromatic hydrocarbon, where the molar amount of component c) is always greater than or equal to the molar amount of component b), d) from 0 to 60 parts by weight of an alkyl ester of an  alpha , beta -olefinically unsaturated carboxylic acid, e) from 2 to 40 parts by weight of at least one  alpha , beta -olefinically unsaturated carboxylic acid, where the molar amount of component e) is always greater than the molar amount of component a),   f) from 5 to 40 parts by weight of at least one hydroxyalkyl ester of an  alpha , beta -olefinically unsaturated carboxylic acid, where the polymerisation is carried out in the presence or absence of solvents, optionally with addition of a water-dilutable solvent, neutralisation and dilution with water. These dispersions are suitable as water-dilutable binders for stoving (baking) varnishes or stoving solid-colour top coats.

<CLAIMS>
An aqueous dispersion of an acrylate copolymer
having a hydroxyl number of from 80 to 160 mg of

KOH/g and an acid number of from 15 to 50 mg of
KOH/g, obtained by free-radical copolymerization of


a) from 10 to 30 parts by weight of at least one
glycidyl ester of an α-branched aliphatic

saturated monocarboxylic acid,
b) from 0 to 30 parts by weight of at least one
diester of an α-olefinically unsaturated dicarboxylic

acid having 1 to 8 carbon atoms in the
ester group,
c) from 0 to 45 parts by weight of at least one
vinyl aromatic hydrocarbon, the molar quantity of

component c) always being greater than or equal
to the molar quantity of component b),
d) from 10 to 60 parts by weight of at least one
alkyl ester of an α-olefinically unsaturated

carboxylic acid, preferably an alkyl or
cycloalkyl (meth)acrylate which contains an alkyl

or cycloalkyl radical having 1 to 18 carbon
atoms,
e) from 2 to 40 parts by weight of at least one
α-olefinically unsaturated carboxylic acid,

preferably (meth)acrylic acid, the molar quantity
of component e) always being greater than the

molar quantity of component a),
f) from 5 to 40 parts by weight of at least one
hydroxyalkyl ester of an α-olefinically

unsaturated carboxylic acid, preferably an ester 
of (meth)acrylic acid with a polyhydric aliphatic

alcohol having from 2 to 6 carbon atoms,

the copolymerization being carried out in bulk or in
the presence of a water-dilutable solvent, if

desired further water-dilutable solvent being added
subsequently, and finally the neutralization with

bases being effected so as to give, after dilution
with water, a stable dispersion having a pH of

between 6 and 10.
An aqueous dispersion as claimed in claim 1, wherein
the acrylate copolymer is obtained by free-radical

copolymerization of a glycidyl ester of a heavily
branched monocarboxylic acid having 9 to 11 carbon

atoms as component a).
An aqueous dispersion as claimed in claim 1, wherein
the acrylate copolymer is obtained by free-radical

copolymerization of isobornyl (meth)acrylate as
component d).
An aqueous dispersion as claimed in claim 1, which
comprises carrying out the polymerization in a

water-dilutable solvent whose mass is from 5 to 35%,
preferably from 10 to 25% of the sum of the masses

of polymer and solvent, and which is added in whole
or in part together with monomers c) to f).
A method of using an aqueous dispersion as claimed
in claim 1 as a binder in aqueous clearcoat baking

enamels or aqueous solid-color baking enamels.
A method of using an aqueous dispersion as claimed
in claim 1 as a binder in aqueous clearcoat baking

enamels or aqueous solid-color baking enamels
together with highly reactive, partially etherified

melamine-formaldehyde resins as curing agents.
