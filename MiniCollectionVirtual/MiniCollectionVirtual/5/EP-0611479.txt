Backcrround of the InventionHigh temperature superconducting (HTSC) compounds including mixed oxides of rare earth, alkaline earth and copper metals are known (e.g., Phillips). Wu et al., and Hor et al . have discussed Y-Ba-Cu-O compound systems as 

exhibiting HTSC. Moodenbaugh et al . , Murphy et al., and Hor et al . disclose additional rare earth, alkaline earth, copper metal mixed oxide compounds exhibiting superconductive properties. Additional superconducting mixed metal oxide compounds of La-Sr-Cu-O, Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-0 and Tl-Ba-Ca-Cu-0 have also been developed. Tarascon et al. disclose Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-0 superconducting compounds of the formula 

 wherein n = 1, 2 or 3 which are prepared by firing at high temperatures stoichiometric amounts of Bi2o3, SrC03 or Sr02, and CuO powders.
