<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for producing, in a test piece of 
a fabric or polymeric material, a simulation of the 

effects of fatigue suffered in normal use comprises 
retaining means (1,2) for retaining a test piece such 

that at least a portion thereof is maintained under a 
predetermined tension; an abrading tool (3) comprising 

a blade (4) having a tip (5) which in use contacts the surface 
of the portion of the test piece maintained under 

tension; and means (7-12) for oscillating the blade (4) 
through a predetermined amplitude such that, in use, 

the blade (4) subjects the test piece to surface abrasion 
and flexing. 
The apparatus is used to study the effects of 
wear in fabric and/or polymeric materials, 

particularly the effects of surface abrasion and 
flexing in timing and transmission belts.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus
for producing, in a test piece, a simulation of the
effects of fatigue in a fabric or polymeric material.
It further relates to a method of determining the
effects of wear on a sample of fabric or polymeric
material using the apparatus. The apparatus and the
method described herein are particularly useful for
determining the effects of surface abrasion and
flexing in timing or transmission belts.The effect of wear on a sample of a fabric or
polymeric material is conventionally tested by placing
the sample in contact with a flat stationary abrasive
surface and then moving the sample across the abrasive
surface while applying force to press the sample onto
the abrasive surface. After a period of time the
sample is removed and inspected for abrasion.In this prior art method described above the
emphasis is on surface abrasion and the extent of
abrasion suffered by the sample is determined by
visual inspection.A realistic abrasion test would also, however,
take the effect of flexing of the fabric or polymeric
material into consideration. This is especially
important if the results of testing are to be used to
provide information on the extent of wear suffered by
a fabric or polymeric material during normal usage
which involves a strong element of flexing
simultaneous with abrasion. For instance, in the
normal use of transmission belts, such as belts used
to drive industrial machinery or those used in
automotives, friction and flexing are natural
fatigue-imparting elements in the belt action. Such apparatus is known from DE-C-831 336.The aim of the present invention is to provide
an apparatus which imparts fatigue to a sample closer
to that which is actually suffered by a fabric during 
ordinary use.The present invention provides an apparatus
for producing, in a test piece of a fabric or
polymeric material, a simulation of the effects of
fatigue suffered in normal use which apparatus
comprises
retaining means for retaining a test piece
such that at least a portion thereof is
maintained under predetermined tension;an abrading tool comprising a blade having a
tip, preferably of a tungsten carbide rod,
which in use contacts the surface of the
portion of the test piece maintained under
tension; andmeans for oscillating the blade through a
predetermined amplitude such that in use the
tip of the blade subjects the test piece to
surface abrasion and flexing, characterized in that
   the retaining means comprise a
first clamp and a second clamp located away from the
first

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for producing, in a test piece of a fabric or
polymeric material, a simulation of the effects of fatigue suffered in

normal use which apparatus comprises

retaining means (1,2,20-27) for retaining a test piece under tension
an abrading tool (3, 28) comprising a blade (4, 29-32) having a tip which in use
contacts the surface of the portion of the test piece

maintained under tension; and
means (7-12) for oscillating the blade through a predetermined
amplitude such that, in use, the blade subjects the test piece

to surface abrasion and flexing, characterised in that the
retaining means comprise a first clamp (1) and a second clamp (2)

located away from the first clamp, wherein the first and
second clamps are adapted to retain opposite ends of a test

piece and to maintain the test piece between the two clamps
under predetermined constant tension.
An apparatus according to claim 1, which also includes a
temperature probe for contacting the test piece said probe being

linked to a visual temperature indicator means.
An apparatus according to either claim 1 or claim 2, wherein
the blade is pivotable about an axis such that when it oscillates

through a predetermined amplitude the tip (5) of the blade describes an
arc. 
An apparatus according to any one of claim 1 to 3, having
two or more test pieces.

comprising means for adjusting the amplitude of the oscillation.
An apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 5, further
comprising means for adjusting the frequency of the oscillation.

piece.
An apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 7, wherein
the abrading tool (3) is positioned such that, during operation of the

apparatus, the blade (4) of the tool at the mid-point of its oscillation
presses into the fabric of the test piece.

the test piece is maintained in an environmental chamber.
A method of studying the effects of wear in a transmission
belt comprising


1) taking a test piece of fabric-containing composite formed of a
rigid backing member having on one surface thereof a layer of

a vulcanized natural or synthetic rubber composition which, 
prior to being vulcanized, is contacted with a layer of

stretched fabric;
2) locating said test piece in the apparatus of any one of claims 1 to
9 with the fabric layer facing the abrading tool (3, 28) and retaining

the test piece under predetermined tension by the retaining
