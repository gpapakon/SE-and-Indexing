<ABSTRACT>
A method for making a substantially 
silanol-free silicone resin powder having a primary 

particle size in the range of about 0.1-200 nm and an 
aggregate particle size of 10 nm to 200 microns is 

provided. An organic solvent dispersion of an 
organosiloxane hydrolyzate having triorganosiloxy 

units and tetrasiloxy units is treated with an organo 
nitrogen compound, such as a silazane and thereafter 

spray dried. The substantially silanol-free 
organosilicon powder has been found useful in making 

heat curable organopolysiloxane compositions, such as 
pressure sensitive adhesives.

<DESCRIPTION>
Reference is made to copending applications 
EP-A-0614959 and GB-A-2275929. The present invention relates to 
substantially silanol-free silicone resin powder 
having a primary particle size in the range of 0.1-200 
nm and an aggregate particle size of 10 nm to 200 
microns. More particularly, the present invention 
relates to a method involving the pretreatment of an 
organic solvent dispersion of an organosiloxane 
hydrolyzate with an organosilicon nitrogen material, 
such as an organosilylamine, or organosilazane, and 
the spray drying of the resulting mixture to form a 
substantially silanol-free silicone resin powder 
useful for making heat curable organopolysiloxane 
compositions having improved processing 
characteristics. A method for making silicone resin powder 
is shown by Wolfgruber et al, U.S. Patent 4,935,484. 
An aqueous colloidal suspension of an organo siloxane 
copolymer is spray dried to produce a silicone resin 
powder having an average particle diameter of 10 to 
150 nm. Although spray dried powders made by 
Wolfgruber et al can be utilized in a variety of 
applications as fillers, the powders are contaminated  
 
with the emulsifying agent which was was used in the 
preparation of the organosiloxane copolymer. 
As taught by Wolfgruber et al, silicone resin powder 
made by spray drying an aqueous silicone mixture can 
be used as a substitute for finely divided silica in 
plastics. However, it has been found that aqueous 
spray dried powder made in accordance with the method 
of Wolfgruber et al having triorganosiloxy units, 
chemically combined with tetrasiloxy units is 
incompatible with silicone fluids. Attempts therefore 
to utilize such silicone resin powder to produce heat 
curable silicone compositions, such as pressure 
sensitive adhesive (PSA) shown by Murakami et al, U.S. 
patent 4,774,297 have been unsuccessful. In GB-A-2275929, there 
is shown a procedure for making a silicone resin 
powder by spray drying an organic solvent dispersion 
of an organosiloxane hydrolyzate. The silicone resin 
powder is dispersible into silicone fluid and useful 
for making heat curable silicone compositions, such as 
PSAs. An organic solvent dispersion of an 
organosiloxane hydrolyzate, comprising triorganosiloxy 
units, or "M" units of the formula, 
(R)3SiO0.5 , 
chemically combined with tetrasiloxy units, or "Q" 
units of the formula, 
SiO2, 
is spray dried to form a free flowing organosilicon 
resin powder having a primary particle size of 0.1-200 
nm and an aggregate particle size of 10
