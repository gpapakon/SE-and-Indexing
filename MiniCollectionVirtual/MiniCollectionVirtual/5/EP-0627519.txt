<ABSTRACT>
A dryer has an internal drying chamber (41) for 
accommodating articles that are subjected to heated circulating 

air to remove moisture from the articles. An air mixing chamber 
contains a first fan (74) for moving air through a heater (73) into the 

drying chamber (41). A second fan (77) draws air out of the drying and 
mixing chambers and discharges air through a filter (31,32,33) 

into the 
external environment. The heated air in the drying chamber is 

mixed (43) with fresh air and recirculated through the drying chamber 
to minimize heat losses and increase drying effectiveness. 

Ultraviolet lamps (59,61,95) within the drying chamber destroy 
contaminants 

in the air and articles within the chamber. A boot dryer (79), 
located in the drying chamber, has fans (94,96) that move air through 

tubes (84,86,87,88) used to support boots, shoes, skates and socks. 
Ultraviolet light (95) in the boot chamber destroy contaminants in the 

air in the boot chamber and articles supported on the tubes. One 
modification of
 the dryer (400) located within a locker room is used 
to remove moisture and odors from the air in the locker room. 

The dryer has a dehumidifier (418) for cooling and removing moisture 
from the air, a heater coil (423) for heating the air, ultraviolet 

lights (436) for destroying contaminants and a charcoal filter for 
removing odors from the air flowing out of the dryer. Another 

modification of the dryer has a portable housing (600) supporting a 
heater (628) and a fan (624) for moving air through filters (623) 

and a drying chamber (608).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is in the field of dryers for drying 
clothing, sporting and athletic equipment. The drying is 
achieved by circulating heated air in an enclosed chamber 
accommodating the articles to be dried. Wet outdoor garments, sport clothing and equipment have 
in the past been stored in garages, back rooms and basements 
where they would eventually dry due to natural air circulation. 
The natural air circulation is not conducive to rapid drying of 
articles. The damp articles, such as clothing, will mildew and 
have unpleasant odors when stored without adequate drying. Cloth 
drying machines having housings with drying chambers have been 
used for drying clothes. These machines have heating elements 
and fans for circulating hot air within the drying chambers to 
dry the clothes placed in the drying chambers. An example of 
this type of drying machine is shown by C.J. Liang in U.S. Patent 
No. 5,152,077. The machine has a housing having a drying chamber 
for accommodating clothes. Heated air moving through the drying 
chamber carries moisture out of the drying chamber into a 
condensing compartment where moisture is condensed into water and 
then delivered to an evaporating apparatus and converted into 
steam. The steam is dried by an electric heater and moved back 
into the drying chamber. An ultraviolet light is located within 
the drying chamber for sterilizing the clothes in the drying 
chamber. Other machines having drying chambers for accommodating 
heated air for drying clothing are disclosed by A. Irving in U.S.  
 
Patent No. 4,682,424 and J.W. McCormick in U.S. Patent No. 
1,755,013. The invention is directed to a self-contained dryer 
having an internal chamber for accommodating articles, such as 
clothing, sporting equipment, hockey gear, shoes and other 
objects. The dryer has a housing enclosing a drying chamber in 
which the articles are dried and stored. Doors attached to the 
housing permit access to the interior of the chamber. Heated air 
is directed with a first fan into the drying chamber 
simultaneously with the discharge of air from the drying chamber 
with a second fan which draws fresh air into the drying chamber 
and discharges air to the outside of the dryer. The heated air 
is recirculated in the drying chamber to increase its moisture 
content so that the dryer has effective, energy-efficient 
characteristics. Filters, such as charcoal filters, located 
adjacent air inlets and outlets, remove airborne odors and 
particulates from the air moving into and out of the

Dryer for articles having a housing (11, 501 or 
601) with an internal drying chamber (41, 341, 508 or 608) for 

accommodating articles, a door (18, 19, 318, 503 or 609) to 
permit access into the drying chamber to allow articles to be 

placed within the drying chamber, a heater (73, 533 or 628) for
