<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a mower-crusher comprising 
a cutter bar (7) which extends substantially transversely to 

the direction of operative travel over the field and mowing 
members arranged thereabove. The cutter bar (7) is connected 

for its support in at least two places to a carrier frame 
(3). The mower-crusher furthermore comprising a crusher 

device (12), while the connection between the carrier frame 
(31) and the cutter bar (7) extends via the crusher device 

(12), a resilient element (54) being arranged between the 
crusher device (12) and the cutter bar (7).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a mower-crusher as
described in the preamble of claim 1.A mower-crusher of the above-defined type is from
document EP-A-0 056 804.In this known construction the crusher device is
connected via horizontally arranged resilient strips with the
frame of the mower. This construction has the disadvantage
that forces between the crusher device and the mower frame,
which are directed perpendicularly to the direction of
operative travel of the mowing machine are not absorbed. Due
to these forces the connection between the crusher device and
the mower frame can be damaged.The invention has for its object to improve the
above-mentioned construction. This is, according to the
invention, achieved by the features in the characterizing
part of claim 1. This resilient connection renders it possible
to reduce to a significant extent not only the bending
moments occuring in the connection, but also the forces
acting in the longitudinal direction of the cutter bar. It is
thus possible to have a relative simple construction in which
the framework to a sufficient extent retends the possibility
of observing the forces exerted in a direction opposite to
the direction of operative travel. In accordance with the
invention the cutter bar is constituted by a supporting beam
to which one end of the resilient element is connected while
the other end of the resilient element is connected to a
frame part of the crusher device. The latter has the advantage
that it is not necessary to provide an extra connection
between the carrier frame and the cutter bar, in which a
resilient element is incorporated. Preferably, the resilient
element is connected to the lower end of the frame.In a preferred embodiment there is not only provided
between the cutter bar and the carrier frame at least 
one connection having a resilient element, but the cutter bar
is also connected in at least one position to the carrier
frame via the relevant outermost mowing member. In accordance
with the invention the second connection is constituted by a
pivot whose pivot shaft extends substantially horizontally in
the direction of operative travel of the mowing machine.The mower-crusher disclosed here can be moved by a
tractor both on the side mounted and has a front mounted
machine.For a better understanding of the present invention
and to show how the same may be carried into effect,
reference will now be made, by way of example, to the accompanying
drawings of some embodiments, in which drawings:
