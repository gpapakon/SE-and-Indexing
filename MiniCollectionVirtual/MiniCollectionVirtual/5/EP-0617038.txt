Ar 
where Ar = unsubstituted phenyl, 3-methoxyphenyl, 

or 4-methoxyphenyl and n = 1 or 
2.

 
are prepared by displacing the C(2)-chloro of 3-acetyl- 

2,5-dichlorothiophene with benzyl mercaptide to form the 
thioether of structure, which is then converted to 3-acetyl-5-chloro-2-thiophenesulfonamide 

by reaction with 
chlorine to form 3-acetyl-5-chloro-2-thiophenesulfenyl 

chloride, followed by reaction with ammonia to form 3-acetyl-5-chloro-2-thiophenesulfenamide, 
and finally 

oxidation. Bromination provides 3-bromoacetyl-5-chloro- 
2-thiophenesulfonamide which is converted to (S)-3,4- 

dihydro-6-chloro-4-hydroxy-2H-thieno[3,2-e]-1,2-thiazine-1,1-dioxide 

by reduction with (+)-β-chlorodisopinocampheylborane 
followed by treatment with 

aqueous base. Alkylation at N(2) provides the (S)-3,4-dihydro-6-chloro-4-hydroxy-2-substituted-2H-thieno[3,2-e]-1,2-thiazine-1, 

1-dioxide. Formation of the C(6) 
anion is accomplished by halogen-metal exchange, and the 

anion is reacted with sulfur dioxide to form a lithium 
sulfinate, which upon reaction with hydroxylamine-O-sulfonic 

acid provides the (S)-3,4-dihydro-4-hydroxy-2-substituted-2H-thieno[3,2-e]-1,2-thiazine-6-sulfonamide-1, 

1-dioxide. Protection of the C(6)-sulfonamide 
functionality, followed by activation of the C(4)-hydroxyl 

and displacement with an appropriate amine 
provides the (R)-3,4-dihydro-4-alkylamino-2-substituted-2H-thieno[3,2-e]
-1,2-thiazine-6-sulfonamide-1,1-dioxide.
