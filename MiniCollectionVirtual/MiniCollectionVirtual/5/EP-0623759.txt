<ABSTRACT>
A thread-forming screw for directly screwing into concrete, stone or the like has a screwhead (11), a screw shank (12) and a thread (14) which extends at least partially over the length of the screw shank. According to the invention, the ratio of external diameter (da) to the core diameter (dk) of the screw is approximately 1.25 to 1.5, the ratio of external diameter (da) to pitch (p) is approximately 1.5 to 1.6, and the flank angle ( alpha ) of the thread (14) is smaller than 50@ and greater than or equal to 35@.

Thread forming screw for direct insertion into concrete, 
masonry or the like having a screw head (11) and screw shank 

(12), whose thread (14) at least partly extends over the 
screw shank length, wherein the ratio of the external diameter 

(d
a
) to the core diameter (d
k
) of the screw is approximately 
1.25 to 1.5, the ratio of the external diameter (d
a
) to the 
lead (p) of the thread (14) is approximately 1.5 to 1.6 and 

the profile angle (α) of the thread (14) is smaller than 
50° and equal to or larger than 35°. 
Screw according to claim 1, characterized in that on either 
side of the thread base the screw shank has depressions (8,9) 

for receiving broken away rock flour. 
Screw according to one of the claims 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the thread burr (15) of the thread (14) has bow-shaped 

cutting teeth (17). 
Screw according to claim 3, characterized in that the thread 
burr (15) of the thread (14) is interrupted at intervals 

by recesses (16), that the burr portions left behind between 
the recesses (16) form the bow-shaped cutting teeth (17) 

and that the cutting edges (17a) of the cutting teeth (17) 
in the same plane as the thread bore are directed in the 

insertion direction of the thread (14) and are set at a negative 
angle (28) with respect to the radial direction (30). 
Screw according to claim 3 or 4, characterized in that per 
turn of the thread (14) there are six to thirty cutting teeth 

(17). 
Screw according to one of the claims 3 to 5, characterized 
in that the recesses (16) forming the cutting teeth (17)  

 
have a depth (t), which corresponds to 5/7 to 7/7 of the 

thread height (h). 
Screw according to one of the claims 3 to 6, characterized 
in that the negative setting angle (28) of the cutting edges 

(17a) of the cutting teeth (17) is 25 to 35°. 
Screw according to one of the claims 1 to 7, characterized 
in that in place of or in the extension of the screw head 

(11) is provided an extension, particularly a screw bolt 
with a metric thread. 
Use of a screw according to one of the claims 1 to 8 in a 
hole, characterized in that the lead (p) with respect to 

the diameter (d
b
) of the predrilled hole (10) for receiving 
the screw is as follows:

diameter (d
k
) behaves in the following way with respect to 
the diameter of the hole (d
b
) 

Use according to one of the claims 9 or 10, characterized 
in that the external diameter (d
