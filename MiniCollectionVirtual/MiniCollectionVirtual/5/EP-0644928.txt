<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides dual-skinned membrane useful as one way or rectifying membranes which reduce back filtration of solute molecules in dialysis and which improve nutrient supply and product recovery in membrane bioreactors. The membranes are dual-skinned polymeric materials preferably in the form of hollow fibers. The membranes have skins of polymer on the opposite sides with differing permeability to solutes and sieving coefficient characteristics. The skin on each side have pores that are invisible at 10,000 times magnification, the microporous structure between said skins contains pores capable of retaining solutes in a molecular weight range of about 5000 to 200,000 in an increased concentration between the interior and the exterior skins. Improved dialysis devices are formed by using bundles of the hollow fiber membranes as a dialysis means having rectifying properties.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to fluid filtration devices, such as blood dialysis devices and bioreactors and membranes for such devices.Dialysis membranes and devices perform important
life sustaining functions when used in
artificial kidneys and other types of filtration
devices. A well recognized problem of high flux
dialyzers is the back filtration from dialysate to
the blood of undesirable molecules. Due to the high
cost of using sterile, pyrogen-free dialysates, it
would be highly desirable to have available a dialysis
membrane which could remove relatively large
solutes such as Î²-2 microglobulin while preventing
passage of similarly sized molecules from dialysate
to blood. Membranes, however, which offer a high
rate of diffusion of solutes from the blood to
dialysate also suffer from high rates of back
diffusion of solutes from dialysate back to the
blood. Similarly, existing membranes which offer a
high rate of convection also suffer from high rates 
of back filtration. A need has therefore existed
for dialysis membranes which provide for adequate
removal of uremic toxins from the blood while
preventing back transport of undesirable substances
to the blood. Similarly, other fluid filtration
processes benefit from the availability of membranes
having such rectifying properties.A need has also existed for devices such as
bioreactors in which rectifying membranes provide a
means for simultaneously supplying nutrients to and
carrying products and waste byproducts from live
cells that are used to make products which cannot be
economically produced by traditional synthetic
chemistry techniques.An important object of the invention is to
provide new and improved membranes for filtration
devices such as dialysis devices. A further aspect
of the invention is to provide improved filtration
devices containing membranes with rectifying properties,
i.e., have a greater sieving coefficient in
one direction than the other, and improved
filtration methods using such devices.The membranes are dual-skinned membranes
such as hollow fibers in which the pore size and
structure, and the resulting sieving coefficient,
differs between the two opposed surfaces of the
membrane. In the preferred embodiment, the membranes
are in the shape of hollow fibers in which
the sieving coefficient, or permeability to
molecules of a particular size, of the inner wall or
skin of the fiber is greater than that of the outer
wall. Such fibers can be assembled into dialysis
devices in accordance with known procedures to 
provide such dialysis

5000 to 20,000, in an increased concentration between the interior and the

exterior skins, the membrane having an overall sieving coefficient for
passage of fluids containing solutes comprising molecules in said selected

molecular weight range in one direction different from the overall sieving
