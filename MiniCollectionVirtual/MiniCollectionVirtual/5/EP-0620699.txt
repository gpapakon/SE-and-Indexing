<ABSTRACT>
A motion detector is proposed for switching at least one light source as a function of movement, having a switching stage (2), which connects, as required, the at least one light source (1) to an energy-supply stage (3) and which can be controlled as a function of the signals of a motion sensor (5) as soon as the instantaneous light intensity falls below a lower brightness limit which can be predetermined. The instantaneous light intensity is simulated by a time module (17, 17') in accordance with the position of the sun, as defined by sunrise and sunset, as a function of the instantaneous calendar day and the instantaneous calendar month. Either a calendar unit (10) and a clock unit (9) or a radio-controlled clock receiver (18) serve to predetermine the instantaneous calendar day, the instantaneous calendar month and the instantaneous time.

Motion detector for switching at least one light
source in a fashion dependent on motion, having a switching

stage (2) which, if required, connects the at least
one light source (1) to a power supply stage (3) and can

be controlled as a function of the signals of a motion
sensor (5) as soon as the current light intensity undershoots

a prescribable lower brightness limit, it being
the case that the current light intensity is simulated by

a time module (17, 17') in accordance with the zenith
angle of the sun, defined by sunrise and sunset, as a

function of the current calendar day and of the current
calendar month, the time module (17, 17') has an evaluation

circuit (8) with read-only storage in which the
sunrises and sunsets are stored as a function of the

calendar day and the calendar month, the current calendar
day and the current calendar month are prescribed to the

evaluation circuit (8) with read-only storage, on the
input side, the evaluation circuit (8) drives the light

source as a function of the current sunrise and sunset
while taking account of prescribed differential times

(D1, D2), and an AND gate (4) is provided which drives
the switching stage (2) of the light source (1) on the

output side, the first input (a) of which gate is connected
to a switching stage (6) driven by the motion

sensor (5), and the second input (b) of which is connected
to a switching stage (13) driven by the evaluation

circuit (8), the latter (13) being closed during monitoring
operation by means of the evaluation circuit (8).
Motion detector according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that a calendar unit (10) and a clock unit (9)

are connected to the evaluation circuit (8) with read-only
storage.
Motion detector according to Claim 1, characterized
in that a radio clock receiver (18) is connected to

the evaluation circuit (8) with read-only storage.
Motion detector according to Claims 1 and 2,
characterized in that an input device (12) serves to

input data.
Motion detector according to Claims 1 and 3,
characterized in that a preselection switch (19) serves

to input data.
Motion detector according to one of Claims 1 to
5, characterized in that a differential-value memory (11)

forms and stores the differential times (D1, D2) between
an input end of the monitoring operation (A) and the

current sunrise (SA), as well as between an input start
of the monitoring operation (U) and the current sunset

(SU).
Motion detector according to one of Claims 1 to
6, characterized in that additional data can be input for

operating the light source with uninterrupted light, the
start of operation with uninterrupted light being determined

by the evaluation circuit (8) as a function of the
current sunset while taking account of a prescribed

differential time.
Motion detector according to Claim 7, characterized
in that the first input (a) of the AND gate (4) is

additionally connected to a further switching stage (15)
likewise driven by the evaluation circuit (8), said

switching stage (15) being connected during the operation
with uninterrupted light by means of the evaluation

circuit (8).
