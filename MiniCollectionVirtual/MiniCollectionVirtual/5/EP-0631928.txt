<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an articulated switch for a device, which is fitted on an articulated spindle and can adopt two pivoted positions, in particular for a bicycle dynamo, one part (15), which protrudes on the articulated spindle (7), bearing, in a first pivoted position, against a stop (14) arranged on the device and a movement of the device causing it, outside the stop, to pass in the axial direction, the stop (14) being formed by a step or recess of a bearing part (10) which is secured within the device housing (6) and in which the articulated spindle (7) is mounted.
