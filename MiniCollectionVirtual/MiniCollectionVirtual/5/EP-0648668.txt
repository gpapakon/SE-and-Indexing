<ABSTRACT>
The high-speed ferry is composed of a buoyancy body (3) connected via a support (4) and having propulsion (7), the buoyancy body (3) being provided with pivotable hydrofoils (5), or hydrofoils (5) equipped with rudder flaps, and a fin assembly (6), and has two lateral hulls (9, 10; 9a, 10a) with a profile tapering towards the bottom and has a small waterline area (8) of the support (4). In a preferred embodiment, the lateral hulls (9a, 10a) can be sunk. This type of ship is intended in particular for ships over 500 t gross weight, the buoyancy body producing a good lift-drag ratio and the slim support producing a low wave-making resistance, while the hydrofoils together with the fin assembly provide for additional buoyancy and vertical stability, and the lateral hulls tapering towards the bottom prevent so-called slamming. This results in a high-speed ship with makes smooth passage even in a heavy swell.
