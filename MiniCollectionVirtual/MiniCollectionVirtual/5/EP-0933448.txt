<ABSTRACT>
A thermal barrier coating system (14) and a method for
forming the coating system on a component designed for use

in a hostile thermal environment, such as superalloy
turbine, combustor and augmentor components of a gas

turbine engine. The coating system includes a diffusion
aluminide bond coat (16) whose oxide growth rate is

significantly reduced to improve the spallation resistance
of a thermal barrier layer by forming the bond coat to

include a dispersion of aluminum, chromium, nickel, cobalt

and/or platinum group metal oxides (20). The oxides preferably
constitute about 5 to about 20 volume percent of the bond

coat. A preferred method of forming the bond coat is to
initiate a diffusion aluminizing process in the absence of

oxygen to deposit a base layer of diffusion aluminide, and
tnen intermittently introduce an oxygen-containing gas into

the diffusion aluminizing process to form within the bond
coat the desired dispersion of oxides. Thereafter, a

ceramic layer (18) is deposited on the bond coat to form a
thermal barrier coating.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to processes for
depositing protective coatings. More particularly, this
invention relates to a process for forming a diffusion
aluminide bond coat of a thermal barrier coating system,
such as of the type used to protect gas turbine engine
components.The operating environment within a gas turbine
engine is both thermally and chemically hostile.
Significant advances in high temperature alloys have been
achieved through the formulation of iron, nickel and
cobalt-base superalloys, though components formed from such
alloys often cannot withstand long service exposures if
located in certain sections of a gas turbine engine, such
as the turbine, combustor and augmentor. A common solution
is to provide turbine, combustor and augmentor components
with an environmental coating that inhibits cxidation and
hot corrosion, or a thermal barrier coating (TBC) system
that, in addition to inhibiting oxidation and hot
corrosion, also thermally insulates the component surface
from its operating environment.Coating materials that have found wide use as
environmental coatings include diffusion aluminide
coatings, which are generally single-layer oxidation-resistant
layers formed by a diffusion process, such as
pack cementation. Diffusion processes generally entail 
reacting the surface of a component with an aluminum-containing
gas composition to form two distinct zones, the
outermost of which is an additive layer containing an
environmentally-resistant intermetallic represented by MAl,
where M is iron, nickel or cobalt, depending on the
substrate material. Beneath the additive layer is a
diffusion zone comprising various intermetallic and
metastable phases that form during the coating reaction as
a result of diffusional gradients and changes in elemental
solubility in the local region of the substrate. During
high temperature exposure in air, the MAl intermetallic
forms a protective aluminum oxide (alumina) scale or layer
that inhibits oxidation of the diffusion coating and the
underlying substrate.For particularly high temperature applications,
a thermal barrier coating (TBC) can be deposited on a
diffusion coating, then termed a bond coat, to form a
thermal barrier coating system. Various ceramic materials
have been employed as the TBC, particularly zirconia (ZrO2)
fully or partially stabilized by yttria (Y2O3), magnesia
(MgO), ceria (CeO2), scandia (S2c3O), or other oxides.
These particular materials are widely employed in the art
because they exhibit desirable thermal cycle fatigue
