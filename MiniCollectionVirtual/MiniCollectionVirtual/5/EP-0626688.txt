A karaoke reproducing apparatus which allows a user 
to specify one vocal part or both vocal parts of two 

parts when one piece of music selected from a plurality 
of pieces of music by the user is a multi-audio type, 

reproduces only instrumental accompaniment (karaoke) when 
both parts are specified, and reproduces the vocal sounds 

of an unspecified one of the two parts together with the

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a karaoke
reproducing apparatus that is equipped with a recording
medium on which pieces of karaoke music or instrumental
accompaniment for a plurality of pieces of music are
recorded, and reproduces or plays any selected music
among those pieces of karaoke music. Such an apparatus is known, for instance, from EP-A-0 509 812.Pieces of karaoke music (instrumental accompaniment)
include one-part or solo songs for one person to sing
along and two-part songs for two persons (duet) to sing
along. The latter type of two-part song is normally sung
by two singers. Thus, a person who wants to sing a two-part
song must have a partner to sing together. However,
there may be a case where such a partner cannot be found.It is therefore an object of the present invention
to provide a karaoke reproducing apparatus which allows
even a single person to sing a two-part song in duet.To achieve the above object, a karaoke reproducing
apparatus according to this invention comprises a
recording medium having a main channel on which signals
each representing instrumental accompaniment of each of a
plurality of pieces of music are recorded, and two 
subchannels for multi-audio music having two vocal parts,
included in the plural pieces of music, one of the
subchannels being recorded with a signal representing at
least vocal sounds of one of two parts and the other
subchannel being recorded with a signal representing at
least vocal sounds of the other one of the two parts;
means for generating a music selection instruction
indicating one piece of music among the plurality of
pieces of music in accordance with an operation; playing
means for playing the recording medium for the one piece
of music specified by the music selection instruction;
discrimination means for discriminating whether or not
the one piece of music specified by the music selection
instruction is a multi-audio type; means for designating
one of vocal parts of two parts or both vocal parts
thereof when the one piece of music specified by the
music selection instruction is determined as a multi-audio
type by the discrimination means; and reproducing
means for reproducing a signal on at least one of the
main channel and the two subchannels which is associated
with the designated vocal part or vocal parts, when the
recording medium is played by the playing means.The karaoke reproducing apparatus according to the
present invention allows a user to specify one vocal part
or both vocal parts of two parts when one piece of music
selected
</DESCRIPTION>
