<ABSTRACT>
A thermoformed container lid of flat material, such as paper, and a method for producing it. The frame of the lid has an inner annular projection (2) for engaging below an outer opening bead on a container. Said inner annular projection (2) is designed as a roll (5), as a result of which improved elasticity and greater frame rigidity are achieved. On the opening side of the roll (5), the frame has a portion whose inside diameter is greater than the outside diameter of the frame, thus making it stackable. During production, an inwardly directed roll (5) is firstly beaded over, it is then pushed into the central region of the frame by a longitudinal bead (8), the portion of the frame on the opening side is compressed and expanded, and finally the roll (5) is calibrated and sealed with the frame.

A deep-drawn container lid of flat material 
having a principal surface and a rim adjoining its 

periphery, extending substantially transversely to the 
principal surface and enclosing the lid opening, which rim 

has on its inside an annular projection formed by crimping 
over the rim and serving for location under an outside 

peripheral bead of the container, characterised in that 
the inside annular projection (2) is in the form of a roll 

(5) which is disposed at a distance from the opening edge 
of the rim, and in a zone remote from the roll and 

extending up to the opening edge the inner diameter (D
2
) 
of the rim (9) is at least as large as the outer diameter 

(D
1
) of its portion (10) situated near the principal 
surface (11). 
A container lid according to Claim 1,
 
characterised in that the roll is bonded or sealed to the 

rim. 
A container lid according to Claim 1,
 
characterised in that the roll (5) directly adjoins a rim 

portion (12), the cross-sectional direction of which 
extends outwardly from the roll and which adjoins a step 

of the outer rim layer in the direction of the principal 
surface (11) of the lid. 
A method of producing a lid from heat-sealable 
flat material such as paper, in which an edge strip of a 

blank is deep-drawn as a rim and the rim edge is crimped 
to form an inner annular projection, characterised by the 

following steps:  
 


an inwardly directed roll is crimped at the rim edge, 
the roll is displaced by the formation of a long bead 
in the centre region of the rim inner side, 
the long bead is pressed in a zone remote from the 
roll and extending up to the opening edge, and is 

extended to an inner diameter which is larger than 
the remaining outer diameter of the rim, 
the roll is pressed axially and/or radially under 
pressure and heat, and is optionally grooved and is 

joined to at least one adjoining rim part by sealing.
