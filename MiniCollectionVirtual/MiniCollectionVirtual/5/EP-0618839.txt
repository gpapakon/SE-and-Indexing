<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is a fluid separation module having improved permeate flow characteristics and improved space/volume requirements. Such modules comprise a hollow fiber bundle, a first and optional second tubesheet, an optional casing, a feed inlet, a permeate outlet, and a non-permeate outlet. The module is coiled, curved or bent into a useful non-linear shape which reduces the space requirements for the module essentially without diminishing the effectiveness of the fluid separation. The feed fluid is introduced to the module either in a boreside or a shellside manner. Coil, french horn, spiral or U-shaped configuration or combinations thereof are useful.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a flexible hollow fiber fluid (e.g. gas) separation module.
The flexible module is shaped (deformed,
coiled or bent) into any number of desirable configurations to satisfy any number of overall
system, geometry or space restrictions, specifications or limitations.Hollow fiber membrane modules are commonly divided into two or three
regions, wherein such regions are sealed so that fluid cannot communicate from one region to
the other, except by passing the fluid through the bores of the hollow fibers or permeating the
fluid across the walls of the hollow fibers. When feed fluid is introduced into the open bores,
this approach is usually termed "boreside feed" or "bore feed." Alternatively, the feed fluid
may contact the exterior of the hollow fibers with one or more components permeating and
exiting through the hollow bores (lumen). This approach is usually termed "shellside feed" or
"shell feed." Generally, a hollow fiber membrane module comprises a bundle of hollow fibers
arranged in a fashion such that each end of the hollow fibers are embedded in a resin matrix
commonly referred to as a tubesheet or header. Such fibers communicate through the
tubesheets and are open on the opposite face of each tubesheet. The opposite face of the
tubesheet means herein that face of the tubesheet which is opposite the bundle. Normally, the
regions of the membrane separation module are defined and divided from one another by the
tubesheets and seals about the tubesheets. In a shellside feed membrane module, the fluids to
be separated are introduced into the module in the region between the tubesheets and the
outside of the fibers, and the fluids which permeate through the hollow fiber membranes into
the bores of the hollow fibers are removed at one or both ends of the hollow fibers in the
regions adjacent to the opposite face of one or both. In shellside feed processes, the region
about the hollow fiber bundles is pressurized. The non-permeating fluids are removed from a
region in the area between the tubesheets but outside of the fibers. Optionally, a sweep fluid is 
used in the permeate side. Most commercial industrial fluid separation processes operate in this
fashion.In a boreside feed process, the mixture of fluids to be separated is introduced into
one end of the membrane module adjacent to the opposite face of one of the tubesheets (i.e.
the first tubesheet), such that the feed mixture flows down the bores of the hollow fibers and
one or more components permeate through the walls

<CLAIMS>
A curved shaped fluid separation module having boreside feed
comprising:


A. a plurality of hollow fiber membranes, wherein the hollow fiber
membranes are arranged in a bundle form (10) having a first and a second

end and are adapted for the separation of one or more fluids from one or more
other fluids, said hollow fibers having bores open at said first and second

ends of said bundle;
B. a first tubesheet (14) comprising a thermoset or thermoplastic
material in which said first end of the fiber bundle (10) is embedded so that

the fiber membranes communicate through the first tubesheet and are open on
an opposite face of the first tubesheet, and the disposition of the second end

of the fiber bundle is selected from the group consisting of:

(a) the second end of the fiber bundle is embedded in the first
tubesheet (14) so that the fiber membranes communicate through the first

tubesheet and are open on the opposite face of the first tubesheet (14); and
(b) the second end of the fiber bundle is embedded in a second
separate tubesheet (15) comprising a thermoset or a thermoplastic material so

that the fiber membranes communicate through the second tubesheet (15) and are
open on an opposite face of the second tubesheet;
C. end capping means having a feed inlet means (21) and/or a non-permeate
outlet means (22), respectively, adapted for introducing a feed

mixture of fluids into the bores of the hollow fibers and for removing the fluids
which do not permeate through the hollow fiber membranes, said end capping

means forming a sealed feed inlet region provided with a feed inlet means
(21) for introducing said feed mixture of fluids into the bores of the hollow

fiber membranes and a sealed non-permeate outlet region provided with a
non-permeate outlet means (22) for removing the fluids which do not permeate

through the hollow fiber membranes, wherein in the case of alternative (a)
there is a single end capping means attached to the first tubesheet (14) and a

barrier partly defining within said single end capping means said sealed
feed inlet region and said sealed non-permeate outlet region, and in the case

of alternative (b) an end capping means is attached to each of said first and 
second tubesheets,

the end capping means attached to said first tube sheet (14) forming
said sealed feed inlet region and being provided with a feed inlet means (21)

and the end capping means attached to said second tubesheet (15) forming
said sealed non-permeate region and being provided with a non-permeate

outlet means (22); and
D. a curved, flexible, impervious protective tubing (13) open at both

ends and including at least one permeate exit port (32) enclosing the hollow
fiber membranes bundle (10)

attached to first tubesheet (14) and optional
second tubesheet (15), when

present, wherein in the case of alternative (a) both open
ends of said tubing are sealed to said single end capping means and in the

case of alternative (b) one end of the tubing (13) is sealed to one end capping
means and the other end of the tubing is sealed to the other end capping

means, said protective tubing forming a flexible, optionally pressure resisting,
casing.
The module of claim 1, wherein said hollow fiber membranes are
twisted circumferentially from one end to the other about an axis through the

longitudinal center of the bundle about or greater than the number of degrees of turn
found in the deformed module when turned from a substantially

linear configuration.
The module of claim 2, wherein the hollow fiber membranes are
twisted one full revolution of 360Â° or a multiple thereof.
