<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is an improved wire measuring apparatus 
comprising a wire guide roller mechanism 3 and a looper 5 

to push down a fed wire to a descending position, thereby 
measuring the length of wire in terms of descending 

position at which the wire is held by the looper 5. The 
wire guide roller mechanism 3 comprises a frame, first, 

second and third guide rollers 6, 7 and 8 rotatably fixed 
to the frame. The first and third guide rollers 6 and 8 

rotate in same direction, and the second guide roller 7 
rotates in an opposite direction both in pulling the wire 

forward and backward. Also, the whole guide roller 
arrangement is designed to incline and follow the 

increasing or decreasing inclination of wire length ahead 
of the third guide roller. Thus, the wire curling 

inclination can be reduced from the measured wire. 
The second guide roller acts to reduce the effect 
of the wires bending around the first guide roller and the 

wires extend tangentially from the third guide roller.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a wire measuring 
apparatus equipped with anti-curling means, which apparatus 
is used for manufacturing electric harnesses each 
comprising an electric connector crimped to one or either 
end of a length of wire. As is well known, electric harnesses each 
comprising wires of predetermined lengths with electric 
connectors crimped to their ends are widely used to make 
electric connection between electric devices. Such 
electric harnesses have a variety of wire lengths to meet 
different applications. In this connection electric 
harness producing machines are designed to crimp electric 
connectors to one or both ends of wires, and are designed 
to measure different lengths of wire. Figures 11 and 12 show how the wire measuring 
part of a conventional electric harness producing machine 
measures wire length. Specifically, a length of wire W is 
pulled out of a wire supply reel (not shown) through a wire 
guide roller mechanism 40, and the wire W is caught and 
pushed down by the roller 42 of a looper 41 against the 
tension of the stretched wire W as indicated by arrow. The 
wire length W is determined in terms of the position at 
which the descending looper 41 holds the wire W with its 
roller 42. The wire guide roller mechanism 40 comprises a 
single roller to permit the guiding of a plurality of  
 
parallel wires, and is designed to rotate at a fixed 
position relative to the wire supply reel. In Figures 11 
and 12 means for conveying electric connectors R is 
indicated at 43. The conventional wire measuring system can 
measure wire lengths easily, but it has the following 
deficiencies: when the looper 41 is raised subsequent to 
termination of measurement as shown in Figure 12, and when 
the wire W thus measured is released from tension, the part 
of wire W which was stretched by the descending looper 41 
so it extends from the roller 42 of the looper 41 to the 
wire guide roller mechanism 40 in Figure 11, is curled as 
indicated by K in Figure 12. The curled part of the wire 
length is liable to interfere the rising of the looper 41, 
and when a plurality of wires are measured, these 
individual wires are liable to tangle. Accordingly, the 
efficiency with which wire measuring and crimping can be 
carried out is lowered. The cause of curling is: when the 
roller 42 of the looper 41 is lowered, the wire W is pulled 
over the curved surface of the wire guide roller 40, which 
rotates at a fixed position, thus forming an angle between 
the upstream and downstream
