<ABSTRACT>
Methods of manufacturing fiberboard from 
lignocellulose-containing fibrous material are disclosed 

including defibering the lignocellulose-containing material, 
drying the defibered lignocellulose-containing material by 

contact with a heated drying gas in a first drying step to 
produce a partially dried lignocellulose-containing material, 

mixing the partially dried lignocellulose-containing material 
with a glue, drying the admixture of partially dried 

lignocellulose-containing material and glue by contact with a 
heated drying gas in a second drying step, which is conducted 

at a lower temperature than the first drying step, 
independently controlling the temperature and moisture content 

in the second drying step to produce a dried lignocellulose-containing 
material having a predetermined temperature and 

moisture content, forming the dried lignocellulose-containing 
material into a fiber mat, and hot pressing the fiber mat into 

fiberboard.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the 
manufacture of fiberboard. More particularly, the 
present invention relates to manufacturing fiberboard 
from lignocellulose-containing fibrous material 
utilizing the dry method. Still more particularly, the 
present invention relates to manufacturing fiberboard 
from lignocellulose-containing fibrous material such as 
wood, straw and bagasse using the dry method of 
manufacture therefor. During the manufacture of fiberboard in 
accordance with the dry method, the raw material is 
generally disintegrated by defibering, and the defibered 
material is then normally dried with drying gas in one 
or more steps, and glued. The dried material is then 
formed into a fiber mat, which is then hot pressed to 
provide a finished board. Multi-layer fiberboard is 
manufactured in a corresponding manner. The addition of glue is required in these 
processes in order to provide a fiberboard having 
sufficient strength. The glues utilized for this 
purpose are normally thermosetting glues, such as urea 
resins or phenolic resins. During these known fiberboard manufacturing 
methods, the glue is mixed with the fiber material after 
its defibration, and the material is then dried with hot 
air. The hot air so utilized generally has a high 
ingoing temperature, for example, of about 160°C, so 
that during the drying process the glue can become 
undesirably overheated, and thus harden, at various 
locations, causing the hardened glue to lose its 
adhesive capacity. In order to then compensate for this 
loss of effectively active glue, excessive amounts of 
glue must therefore be added, which, in turn, results in 
a significant cost increase due to the required  
 
unnecessarily high glue consumption. The cost of the 
glue thus constitutes one-quarter to one-third of the 
total cost of the finished fiberboard, thus resulting in 
a considerable increase in the overall manufacturing 
cost, and a corresponding deterioration of the 
manufacturing economy. In another method of fiberboard manufacture, 
the fiber material is first dried in a drier with a high 
temperature drying gas, for example at about 200°C. The 
dried fibers leaving the drier are then mixed with glue 
in a mixer. During this admixture, the glue is mixed 
with an approximately equal amount of water. The 
addition of glue is in the magnitude of about 10% of the 
dry weight of the ready mixture. In order to compensate 
for the water which is added with the glue, the fibers 
must therefore be correspondingly overdried. This
