<ABSTRACT>
A voice Telephone Network Application Platform (NAP) (10) is enhanced to manage facsimile messages, as well as voice messages, by the addition of facsimile functionality (103, 104) to the platform actuatable by high-level facsimile commands (160) from applications supported on the platform. The commands include sending and receiving facsimile messages. A PC facsimile processor (FP) (104), interfacing between the platform and the telephone network (12), stores facsimile messages received from the network and facsimile messages for transmission to the network on hard disk (181). A facsimile command (160) from an application is expanded into NAP commands (162) for controlling the platform and FP commands (161) for controlling the facsimile processor so as to perform the facsimile functionality associated with the facsimile command. A recovery process utilizing a Recovery Token prevents facsimile messages from becoming lost between receipt at the FP and storage in the platform.

 TELEPHONE NETWORK APPLICATION PLATFORM FOR SUPPORTING FACSIMILE APPLICATIONSPREFACEReferences in this Description to S.N. 521,210 are published in U.S. Patent 5,133,004 issued July 21, 1992. References in this Description to S.N. 514,783 are published in U.S. Patent 5,138,710 issued August 11, 1992.References in this Description to S.N. 503,195 are attached hereto as APPENDIX I.BACKGROUND OF INVENTION1. Field of the InventionThe invention relates to providing facsimile (fax) services over the telephone network via application software for such services and involves a telephone network digital computer platform for supporting such application software. 

2. Description of the Prior ArtThe facsimile machine has become ubiquitous in present day communication for transmission of documents. Facsimile transmission over the Public Switched Telecommunications Network (PSTN) annually generates billions of dollars in toll revenues. A variety of facsimile related services and enhanced services are currently available, such as Call Answer, Fax Store and Forward, Fax Mailbox, and the like. Generally, such services are provided by dedicated systems specifically designed for the service and for the hardware environment in which the system will be deployed. Such systems tend to lack flexibility, in that desired changes in functionality often require extensive, and hence expensive, modifications to the application software. Additionally, application software for providing such services are not portable in that a change in hardware environment usually requires substantial application software re-writing. Although such systems are usually computer based, such systems can only perform the functions for which they were designed and, thus, cannot also be utilized to perform general purpose data processing. Also, such systems generally do not have access to data bases stored on general purpose computers. Additionally, if it is desired to provide a wide variety of services, utilization of a large number of dedicated systems tends to be prohibitively expensive.Since the divestiture, the Bell Operating Companies (BOCs) and Independent Telephone Companies (Telcos) have been seeking ways to increase the return on their primary asset; viz, the installed network. One source of increased revenue would be to offer new facsimile related services that integrate into, or interface with the existing network, resulting in greater utilization thereof. It is generally difficult for BOCs and Telcos to provide new services because network
