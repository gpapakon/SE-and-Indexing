<ABSTRACT>
A method for reducing fibre interaction in a tissue paper sheet produced by a wet paper making process. The method comprises the steps of treating the paper fibres with a polycationic product, and dispersing said fibres in a medium consisting of a foam obtained by finely dispersing air bubbles in a medium containing water and an anionic surface-active foaming agent.

Method of preparing a sheet of tissue paper according to 
a technique of wet paper making, comprising a step of 

dispersing the paper fibres in a medium consisting of a foam 
resulting from the fine dispersion of air bubbles in a 

foaming medium containing water and an anionic surfactant 
with a foaming effect, characterised in that the said fibres 

are first treated with a polycationic product so as to form 
fibre/polycationic product/surfactant couplings and obtain a 

debinding effect between the fibres of the sheet of tissue 
paper thus obtained. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
polycationic product is a nitrogen-based polymer product of 

the type generally used to improve the wet or dry strength 
of the paper, or the retention of fibres in the papermaking 

machine. 
Method according to Claim 2, characterised in that the 
polycationic product is a quaternary polyamine. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised 
in that the surfactant is an alpha-olefin sulphonate. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised 
in that the polycationic product is a quaternary polyamine 

and the surfactant an alpha-olefin sulphonate. 
Method for the multi-jet preparation of a sheet of 
multi-layer tissue paper, characterised in that at least one 

of the layers able to be obtained by a method according to 
Claims 1-5.  

 
Sheet of multi-layer tissue paper produced by a multi-jet 
method, characterised in that at least one of the layers 

able to be obtained by a method according to Claim 6. 
Sheet according to Claim 7, characterised in that the 
layer situated on the hood side during the drying operation 

of the said sheet contains fibres previously treated by a 
polycationic product.
