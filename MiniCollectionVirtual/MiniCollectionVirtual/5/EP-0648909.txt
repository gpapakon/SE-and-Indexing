<ABSTRACT>
An overhead door holder assembly (10) for attachment 
between a door jamb (14) and a door (12) to hold the door 

in an open position includes a jamb bracket (16) attached 
to the door jamb (14) and a jamb arm (18) pivotally 

attached to the jamb bracket. A channel assembly (22) 
having a channel (23) is attached to the door and one of a 

group of modular slide assemblies (26, 126, 226) that 
interchangeably fit into the channel assembly can be 

selected for pivotal attachment to the jamb arm. The slide 
assemblies have attached polymeric blocks (27) that reduce 

wear caused by sliding components and may have door hold 
and door stop provisions as well.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an overhead door holder assembly 
and more particularly to a modular door holder assembly 
having interchangeable sliding elements with reduced 
sliding friction. Temporarily holding a door in an open position is often 
necessary for convenience and safety, and one commonly 
employed method uses an overhead door control device that 
includes a pivoting arm attached between an upper portion 
of a door jamb and an upper part of a door. When the door 
is to be held open at an angle that does not exceed about 
110 degrees, such a device is efficient, effective and 
convenient to install and maintain. Overhead door control 
devices are less subject to damage by vandalism or 
accidents and do not present a potential stumbling hazard. However, many conventional overhead door control devices 
have components that are difficult to install, maintain or 
replace. What is needed is an overhead door holder 
assembly that is durable, has minimal wear sliding 
component, does not require lubrication and is easy to 
install, adjust or replace with minimal effort and 
expertise. The door holder should be set to permit easy 
engagement of the door holder, to hold the door against 
minor amounts of jostling contact without release, and yet 
to still permit closing the door without undue effort. 
Ideally, such a door holder will include mechanisms that 
prevent its damage from violent or forceful door opening. According to one aspect of the present invention, there is 
provided a door holder assembly for attachment between a 
door jamb and a door for selectively holding the door in an 
open position, the assembly comprising a jamb bracket for  
 
attachment to the door jamb; a jamb arm pivotally attached 
to the jamb bracket; a channel assembly having a channel 
therein defined by channel walls; and a slide assembly 
selectively engageable with the channel assembly to hold 
open the door in use, and the slide assembly being 
pivotally attached to the jamb arm for movement in response 
to opening or closing of the door, characterised in that 
the slide assembly supports at least one low friction 
polymeric block in contact with the channel walls. According to a second aspect of the present invention, 
there is provided a modular overhead door holder system, 
the system comprising a jamb arm for pivotal attachment to 
a door jamb; a channel assembly having a channel therein 
defined by channel walls, and a plurality of slide 
assemblies, each slide assembly being configured to fit 
into the channel
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A door holder assembly (10) for attachment between a 
door jamb (14) and a door (12) for selectively holding the 

door in an open position, the assembly comprising a jamb 
bracket (16) for attachment to the door jamb (14); a jamb 

arm (18) pivotally attached to the jamb bracket (16); a 
channel assembly (22) having a channel (23) therein defined 

by channel walls (21); and a slide assembly (26) 
selectively engageable with the channel assembly (22) to 

hold open the door in use, and the slide assembly being 
pivotally attached to the jamb arm (18) for movement in 

response to opening or closing of the door, characterised 
in that the slide assembly (22) supports at least one low 

friction polymeric block (27) in contact with the channel 
walls (21). 
An assembly according to claim 1, wherein the low 
friction polymeric block (27) is of a nylon filled 

thermoplastics. 
An assembly according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the 
slide assembly (22) further comprises means (244, 245) for 

frictionally engaging the channel walls (21) to hold open 
the door in use. 
An assembly according to claim 3, wherein said 
engaging means (244, 245) further comprises a hold open 

assembly attached to the channel assembly (22), with the 
hold open assembly having a hold open stop (128) fixed in 

the channel assembly and having a stop element (138) with 
a first ramp (139) and a second ramp (140) and the slide 

assembly supporting a pivotably connected rocker (142), the 
rocker having a catch (144) and rocker face (145), with the 

catch shaped to slide over the first ramp (139) for 
 

reversible engagement with the second ramp (140) of the 
stop element to hold the door in an open position. 
An assembly according to claim 4, wherein the slide 
assembly comprises an adjustment wedge (146) having a wedge 

face (152), the adjustment wedge being positioned to 
contact the rocker face and control positioning of the 

rocker catch with respect to the stop element. 
An assembly according to claim 5, wherein the 
adjustment wedge (146) has a wedge channel (154) 

therethrough, the wedge channel accommodating a position 
pin (156) attached to the slide assembly (126) that
