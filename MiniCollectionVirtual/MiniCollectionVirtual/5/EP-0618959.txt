<ABSTRACT>
Process to re-refine used oils, wherein the oils (A1) are initially subjected to a pretreatment (A) with a basic reagent (A2), then to a first preflash treatment (B) to eliminate the water (B1) and the most volatile fractions (B2) contained therein, and finally to a combined treatment (C) of fractional distillation and of purification to eliminate the high polymers and heavy metals, carried out into a single filled-type column (21), in order to obtain one or more fractions of re-refined oils (C3). The separation of the high polymers and heavy metals takes place, together with a cut of very heavy and viscous oils, from the bottom of the column (21) by means of a cyclone device (23). The re-refined oils (C3) are then subjected to a suitable decolorization treatment (D) and can be used as base oils for the production of lubrification oils.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a high-yield and low-pollution
process to re-refine used lubricating oils. In this particular branch of
technique, the term "re-refining" means transforming used oils and fats -
derived from engines or from other industrial uses - into base oils. Such
base oils are then used, after mixing with suitable additives, as new
lubricating oils having qualitative features which can be fully compared
to those of the oils directly obtained by petroleum refinery.The first industrial plants for re-refining used oils appeared in
the nineteensixties, mainly in response to the considerable ecological
problems resulting from the ground or water disposal of used oils. In the
years that followed - due, on one hand, to the consumption increases and,
on the other hand, to the costs of virgin oils of first refinery - the
re-refined oils have been conquering an increasingly important position
even as raw material. At present they are competitive, both as far as
availability and as far as cost, with the oils directly obtained from
petroleum.The increasing economic interest in re-refined oils has led the
governmental authorities to be more sensitive to the problem of their
collection and concentration, by creating associations for collecting
used oils, to which all the users are compelled to deliver their oils.
This trend is up-to-date still in full expansion; in fact, in the EEC
countries, against an annual consumption of lubricating oils amounting to
about 4 millions of tons, and a corresponding theoretical quantity of
recoverable used oils amounting to about 2.5 millions of tons, only 1.5
millions of tons of said used oils are actually collected and delivered
to the re-refining centres, the remaining amount being disposed of in an
uncontrolled manner, thus certainly harmful for the environment.There are substantially two processes, mostly known and adopted in
technique, to carry out the re-refining of used oils: the sulphuric acid
process and the propane process. In both these processes, the used oils 
are first of all freed from the water contained therein, and are then
purified - with sulphuric acid or, respectively, with propane - to eliminate
the other impurities present therein. These last ones substantially
consist of compounds with high molecular weight contained in the oil
additives, and of metals derived either directly by wear of the metallic
parts, or indirectly by the metals present in the fuels or in the oil
additives, as for example lead in petrols.The sulphuric acid process was

Process to re-refine used oils, of the type in which said oils (A1) are:

contacted with a basic reagent (A2);
heated for eliminating the water (B1) contained therein;
separated from high polymers and heavy metals;
fractional distilled into a single packed-type column, to obtain one or more
oil fractions for use as lubricating bases; and
decolorized;

characterized in that

said basic reagent (A2) is a highly basic one;
the water (B1) is eliminated in a single preflash treatment (B) together with a
light gas oil fraction (B2);
the high polymers and heavy metals are separated partially as a drain (13) of
a decantation treatment of the dewatered oils (B3) and mostly as a heavy

liquid flow (C2) discharged from the base of said fractionating column.
Process as in claim 1), wherein said filled-type fractionating
column (21) is a four-stage column with an overall flow resistance not

exceeding 40 mm Hg.

column (21) is a four-stage column with an overall flow resistance not

exceeding 20 mm Hg.
Process as in claim 1), wherein the filling (25) of said column

Process as in claim 1), wherein the oils (B3) resulting from the
preflash treatment (B) are fed in a cyclone device (23) positioned in the

lower part of said fractionating column (21), wherein they are separated
into a gaseous fraction which is sent to the upper part of said column

(21), and into said heavy liquid fraction (C2) containing high polymers 
and heavy metals which is discharged.

between 11,8 and 12,8.
Process as in claim 1), wherein said decantation is carried out

Process as in claim 1), wherein the distilled oil fractions
(C3/I,II,III) drawn from the fractionating column (21), before undergoing
