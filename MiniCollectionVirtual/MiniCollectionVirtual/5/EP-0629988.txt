<ABSTRACT>
A continuous sign-language recognition 
apparatus and input apparatus which employ expressions of 

template patterns of sign-language word as well as the 
template patterns of sign-language word to realize high 

speed and highly accurate sign-language recognition. 
Each of component patterns constituting a template 

pattern of a sign-language word is expressed by a feature 
vector representing the pattern when the pattern is a 

static pattern, or by a time-series pattern of a feature 
vector when the pattern is a dynamic pattern. Also, 

using the template patterns of sign-language word, 
different matching methods are applied to the static and 

dynamic patterns for recognizing each component pattern, 
and the respective results are integrated on the basis of 

a temporal overlap of the respective component patterns 
to continuously recognize sign-language words.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an expression
of template patterns of sign-language word used in the
recognition based on the matching between continuous
sign-language patterns, in which sign-language words are
continuously coupled, and to the template patterns of
sign-language word.The present invention also relates to a
continuous sign-language recognition apparatus which
continuously recognizes sign-language words included in
continuous sign-language patterns in a high accuracy and
an input apparatus for inputting a command or the like to
a computer in a form of a gesture previously defined to
the command.Techniques related to the sign-language
recognition have been proposed in "Hand Motion Recognition
Apparatus and Sign Language Translation System" in
JP-A-2-144675 (prior art example 1), "Hand Motion
Recognition Method Using Neuro-computer" in JP-A-3-186979
(prior art example 2), "Gesture Recognition using a Time-Series
Network" in 43th National Conference of Institute
of Information Processing Engineers of Japan, IS-3, 1992
(prior art example 3), and "Sign Language Interpretation
using Continuous DP Matching" in the Human Interface
Study Group in Institute of Information Processing 
Engineers of Japan, 44-12, 1992 (prior art example 4).The prior art examples 1 and 2 are intended to
recognize finger spellings. The prior art example 1
utilizes colored gloves to detect a positional relation
between fingers by an image recognition technique. The
positional relation is matched with previously stored
finger spelling patterns to recognize each finger
spelling. The prior art example 2 recognizes data on
finger spellings inputted from data gloves through a
multi layer neural network. The prior art examples 3 and
4, in turn, are intended to recognize moving sign-language
patterns or gestures. The prior art example 3
determines whether a gesture is dynamic or static by
detecting the first pattern of a dynamic gesture through
a multi layer neural network. Then, a motion is
recognized through a recurrent type neural network from a
starting point at which the first pattern is detected. A
static gesture in turn is recognized through the multi
layer neural network. In this manner, different recognition
systems are used for dynamic gestures and static
gestures. In the prior art example 4, sign-language word
patterns inputted from data gloves are registered in the
form of a dictionary of template pattern of sign-language,
such that sign-language words are recognized by
the continuous DP matching of sign-language
