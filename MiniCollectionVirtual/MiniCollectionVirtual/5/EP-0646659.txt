<ABSTRACT>
A process for the production of a carrier for surface 
plasmon resonance analysis (SPR) in which a metallic 

film comprising a lower preparatory layer of a first 
metal and an upper layer of silver is deposited on a 

surface characterised in that the lower preparatory 
layer comprises a major proportion of nickel.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the
production of carriers for surface plasmon resonance
(SPR).Surface plasmon resonance or (SPR) is a technique
which can be used in the analysis of antibodies which
are deposited on surfaces which have been coated with
thin films of metal, in particular thin films of
silver. SPR based sensors are discussed in a paper by
I Faulkner, W R Flavell, J Davies, R F Sunderland and
C S Nunnerly :"SPR-based sensors studied by electron
energy loss spectroscopy and attenuated total
reflection" - to be published in J Electron
Spectroscopy, 1993. The manner in which a coating is
applied to a surface has important consequences for
the subsequent properties of that surface in terms of
SPR and control of the coating process is important.
At present coating is generally performed by
spattering but control is not good. It is important
that the films are formed from uniform layers of metal
in order to get reproducible SPR. On account of this
improved methods for the production of films for SPR
are desirable.According to the present invention we provide a
process for the production of a carrier for SPR
analysis as defined in the accompanying claims. The lower preparatory layer is formed from metals
comprising a major proportion of nickel. Other metals
suitably present include metals which have previously
been used in preparation of layers of this type such
as titanium and/or chromium. Preferably the lower
preparatory layer is formed substantially entirely
from nickel.In operation of the process of the invention the
surface, which is suitably a glass surface, is
preferably subjected to an appropriate pre-treatment
before the metal film is laid down upon it. A
suitable pre-treatment comprises the steps of
cleaning, followed by treatment by reactive glow
discharge. The lower preparatory layer of the metal
film is then deposited followed by the silver layer.
Preferably after the silver layer is deposited it is
annealed effectively in order to bake the metallic
film, thereby orienting it and enhancing its chemical
properties. The preparatory metallic layer is
preferably thin.Preferably the surface is a glass surface. Any
suitable glass surface may be used but a preferred
surface has a silicon dioxide surface layer.
Particularly suitable types of glass are "PERMABLOC"(TM)
and the earlier product "PERMASHEET"(TM) glass, both
manufactured by Pilkington Glass of St. Helens,
England. These have consistent top layers of silicon
dioxide.In the pre-treatment the glass can be cleaned by
any
