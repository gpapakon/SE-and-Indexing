<ABSTRACT>
An integrated circuit structure is disclosed 
wherein an EPROM cell has an active area (18) formed by 

the same operations as are necessary to form a P region 
(17) intended to contain an N-channel MOS transistor, 

source and drain regions formed by the same operations 
as are necessary to form the source and drain regions 

(31) of said transistor, a control electrode (15) 
consisting of an N+ region formed by the same 

operations as are carried out to form deep regions (14) 
intended to contact buried N+ regions, and a floatin
g 
gate electrode (24) consisting of a layer of conductive 

material formed by the same operations as are carried 
out to form the gate electrodes (23) of the MOS 

transistors in the integrated circuit. 
The EPROM cell can, therefore, be formed in a 
mixed integrated circuit with no need for purposely 

added processing steps.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to integrated
circuits, and particularly to a monolithic integrated
circuit structure including at least one electrically
programmable read-only memory (EPROM,
EEPROM) cell as defined in the preamble of claim 1 and as
known from document JP-A-1-140759.Many industrial applications require complex
electronic circuits to perform multiple functions which
range from the processing of signals, whether in the
analog or the digital form, to the amplification of
such signals and the generation of power signals for
controlling and powering electric loads, e.g. motors,
relays, lamps, etc.. Certain applications involve data
storage functions as well.A trend toward ever more compact circuits has
led to the development of processes for forming
integrated circuits comprised of a large variety of
electronic components, which may have even radically
different structural and functional features, on a
common substrate of semiconductor material. Thus,
monolithic integrated structures comprising CMOS
(Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) circuits have
been developed essentially for processing digital
signals, as have bipolar circuits essentially for
amplifying analog signals, DMOS (Diffused Metal Oxide 
Semiconductor) power components, and bipolar power
components for generating and controlling high voltages
and large currents. For any data storage functions, the
prior art provides external devices purposely designed
and constructed to perform such functions. Prior to the publication of JP-A-1-140759, it was a
widespread opinion among the designers of semiconductor
devices that the manufacturing processes of storage
devices are too deeply different from the manufacturing
processes of so-called mixed integrated circuits of the
type described above, and that while memory cells may
be integrated, at least in theory, to mixed integrated
circuits, this would involve in pratice the addition of
a number of processing steps to the already complicated
manufacturing process, thereby making the process a
highly critical one and the end product generally
unreliable.It is the object of this invention to provide
for a monolithic integrated circuit structure
comprising at least one programmable read-only memory
(EPROM or EEPROM) cell to be formed by a manufacturing
process of mixed integrated circuits with no processing
steps specifically added or with the addition of but
few and non-critical processing steps.This object is achieved by an integrated
circuit structure as defined in claim 1. The invention and its
