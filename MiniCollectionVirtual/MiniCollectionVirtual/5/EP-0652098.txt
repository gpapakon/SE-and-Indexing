<ABSTRACT>
A process for filtration of polymer melts, in which the polymer melt is pumped from below into the tubes of a tubular heat exchanger, around which tubes heat transfer fluid is flushed and there being inserted into each heat exchange tube a filter cartridge in such a way as to form an outer annular gap and in such a way that the main flow of the polymer melt after passing through the filter cartridges and a secondary flow without passing through the filter cartridges emerge at the top from the heat exchanger tubes and are subsequently united.

A process for the filtration of polymer melts using filter cartridges,
characterised in that
 the polymer melt is pumped from below into the tubes
(4a) of a tubular heat exchanger (3) around which heat carrier fluid is flushed,

wherein a filter cartridge (4c) having a detachable connection (4b) at the
upper end is inserted concentrically into each heat exchanger tube (4a), with

the formation of an outer annular gap (8), in such a manner that, after passing
through the filter cartridges (4c), the main flow (10a) of the polymer melt and

a bypass flow (10b), corresponding roughly 0.03 to 3.0 % by weight of the
entire flow, without passing through the filter cartridges (4c), discharges at the

top from the heat exchanger tubes (4a), and these flows are combined in a
collection chamber (11) directly connected to the upper tubular sheet (7b),

and afterwards the polymer melt is discharged from the collection chamber
(11) via an outlet aperture (6).
A process according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the detachable connections (4b) of the filter cartridges
(4c) comprise ducts (9a, 9b) for the outlet of the bypass flows in the peripheral

region.
A process according to Claim 2,
characterised in that
 the ducts (9a, 9b) in the outlet region of the collection
chamber (11) extend parallel to the tubular sheet (7b) and outwardly

orientated in relation to the tube axis.
A process according to one of Claims 2 or 3,
characterised in that
 the ducts (9a, 9b) contain a filter medium. 
A process according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that
 the length of the filter cartridges (4c) is equal to 95 to
100 % of the length of the heat exchanger tubes (4a) and the gap width of the

annular gap (8) between filter cartridge (4c) and tube (4a) lies in the range
from 5 to 20 mm.
A process according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that
 the heat exchanger tubes (4a) are disposed in the
tightest possible geometric packing with equal spacings sufficient for / with

heat carrier fluid (3a, 3b).
A process according to one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that
 the collection chamber (11) contains baffles, which
deflect the flows coming out of the heat exchanger tubes (4a) before reaching

the outlet aperture (6) firstly in the direction of the periphery of the collection
chamber (11).
A process according to one of Claims 1 to 7,
characterised in that
 the temperature difference between heat carrier fluid
(3a, 3b) and polymer melt is 1 to 5°C and the outlet temperature of the

polymer melt is the same as the inlet temperature ± 1 °C.
A process according to one of Claims 1 to 7,
characterised in that
 the temperature difference between heat carrier fluid
(3a, 3b) and polymer melt is 5 to 20°C and the outlet temperature of the

polymer melt differs by 2 to 10°C from the inlet temperature of the polymer
melt. 
A process according to one of Claims 1 to 9,
characterised in that
 the polymer melt is a ethylene terephthalate
homopolymer or copolymer melt.
