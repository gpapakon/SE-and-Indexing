<ABSTRACT>
A joint, particularly for use with banister assemblies, comprises a ball (14) fixed into position within a socket (13). The balls (14) formed at either end of a plurality of balusters (12), and sockets (13), formed in a base rail (10) and hand rail (11) are preformed at a work shop or factory and subsequently used for construction of a banister assembly. During the construction of such an assembly, the base rail (10) is fixed into position and the hand rail (11) placed in parallel, vertically spaced-apart relation to it, supported loosely by newel posts at either end. Next, balusters (12) are inserted between the base rail (10) and hand rail (11) by inserting a bottom ball of each baluster (12) into the base rail sockets (13) and adjusting the hand rail (11) to enable insertion of the upper balls into the hand rail sockets (13). Once all balusters are in position, the hand rail (11) can be firmly fixed into place. Special connectors (29, 30) are used to enable ajustment and subsequent fixing into position of the hand rail (11), and a special clamp used to assist the formation of the joints where necessary. Replacement ball assemblies (52, 53, 54) are provided to facilitate replacement of broken balusters within existing banister assemblies. Adhesive may be used.

<DESCRIPTION>
 JOINTS AND METHODS OF MAKING THEMTechnical FieldThe invention relates to joints and methods of making them.The invention relates particularly, but not exclusively, to joints in banisters and other items of carpentry.Background ArtThe traditional method of constructing banisters requires several hours work on site by a carpenter. Banisters usually comprise a base rail and a handrail, extending upwardly at an angle, interconnected by vertically arranged supporting balusters.After the carpenter has installed the sloping bottom rail, he has to cut the lower end of each baluster to a corresponding angle, so that when the balusters are mounted on the bottom rail, they extend vertically. The upper end of the balusters also have to be cut at an angle, to receive the handrail. The carpenter also has to fit spacing blocks onto the rails, to space the balusters apart at appropriate intervals.Disclosure of The InventionA first aspect of the invention provides a method of forming a joint, comprising forming a socket in a first member, forming a projection on a second member, the socket and projection being shaped such that the angle of 

the members with respect to one another is adjustable by rotating the projection in the socket, selecting a desired angle, and then securing the socket and projection rigidly together.The sockets and projections can be preformed in a factory or workshop- There is no need to cut angles on site. If a banister is to be constructed, with a plurality of balusters spaced apart, the spacing can be preÂ¬ planned in a workshop or factory, for example by providing a plurality of sockets or projections, spaced apart along a banister rail. The components can then be quickly positioned and secured on site, and it may be possible to reduce the on site time to 20% to 50% of the time taken with prior art methods.The joint may comprise a ball and socket joint.The ball may be spherical, but this is not essential, and any appropriately curved profile may be used, with the ball, for example, being oval, onion-shaped, pear-shaped or egg-shaped.One of the members may comprise the elongate rail of a banister, for example the base rail or the handrail.The other may comprise a baluster.The sockets may be provided on the rail, the projections being provided on the balusters. 

 Alternatively, the projections may be provided on the rail, the sockets being provided on the balusters.The sockets may be formed integrally, or may be formed in separate components which are then attached to the rail or
