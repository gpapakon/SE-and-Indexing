<DESCRIPTION>
 PLAIN BEARING MATERIALSThis invention is concerned with plain bearing materials and with methods of producing such materials.For many years, plain bearing materials of the type described in US Patent Specification No. 2,689,380 have been in common use. Such materials are used for making journal bearings, thrust washers, bearing bushes etc. Such bearing materials comprise a backing layer, e.g. of steel, a supporting layer joined to the backing layer, and a surface layer overlying the supporting layer and bonded thereto. The surface layer provides a low friction surface of the plain bearing material and is formed from a material which comprises a low friction polymeric material, for example polytetrafluoroethylene, and a filler or several fillers, such as lead, zinc, bronze, calcium fluoride, or glass fibre. The supporting layer comprises a porous structure of a sintered metallic material, e.g. bronze, formed on the backing layer and bonded thereto. The porous structure of the supporting layer is impregnated by the material of the surface layer to bond the surface layer to the supporting layer. The surface layer is typically about 25 microns thick.Plain bearing materials of this known type are not electrically conductive in a direction normal to the surface layer thereof. Although the backing layer and the sintered metallic material are good electrical conductors and the surface layer may comprise a filler which is a good electrical conductor, it is found that such a plain bearing material has an electrical resistance in the direction mentioned which exceeds 108 ohms. This lack of electrical 

conductivity is acceptable for many uses of the material as electrical conduction through a plain bearing is not a usual requirement. However, there are circumstances where such electrical conduction is advantageous. For example, the plain bearing material may be used for making bushes used in the hinges of the doors of vehicles. These bushes may electrically insulate the door, which is often made of metal, from the remainder of the vehicle body, which is also often made of metal. In this case, it is possible for users of the vehicle to receive unpleasant electro-static shocks from the door. Another possibility is for arcing to occur between the door and the remainder of the vehicle body during electro-static paint spraying of the vehicle, with detrimental effects on the finished paintwork.It is an object of the present invention to provide a plain bearing material which is electrically-conductive in the direction

CLAIMS
A plain bearing material comprising a supporting layer and a surface layer overlying the supporting layer to provide a low friction surface of the material, the material of the surface layer comprising a low friction polymeric material, and the supporting layer comprising a porous structure which is impregnated by the material of the surface layer to bond the surface layer to the supporting layer, characterised in that the material of the surface layer also comprises particles of structured carbon black which contact one another to form an electrically-conductive network.
A plain bearing material according to claim 1, characterised in that the structured carbon black forms between 2.5% and 20% by volume of the material of the surface layer.
A plain bearing material according to claim 2, characterised in that the structured carbon black forms between 8% and 12% by volume of the material of the surface layer.
A plain bearing material according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the structured carbon black has a pore volume of at least 150 (DBP) cm
3
/100 gms.
A plain bearing material according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the structured carbon black has a surface area of at least 250 (BET- N

A plain bearing material according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the supporting 


layer comprises a sintered metallic material providing the porous structure.
A plain bearing material according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the supporting layer comprises a woven mesh providing the porous structure.
A plain bearing material according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the supporting layer comprises an expanded mesh providing the porous structure.
A plain bearing material according to any one of claims 1 to 8, characterised in that the supporting layer joins the surface layer to a backing layer.
A method of producing a plain bearing material comprising forming an aqueous dispersion containing particles of a low friction polymeric materials and particles of structured carbon black; partially drying the dispersion to form a workable mush; applying the mush to a surface of a porous material; and subjecting the mush to heat and pressure to form it into a low friction surface layer on the porous material and also to force it into the pores of porous material so that the material of the surface layer impregnates the porous material and bonds the surface layer thereto.
