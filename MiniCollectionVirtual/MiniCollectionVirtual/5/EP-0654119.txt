<ABSTRACT>
An integrally-moulded double hinge capable of shifting sideways when opened through 180 , each if its ends being engageable in a respective one of two members (9,10) to be hinge-mounted. The hinge consists of a U-shaped element (1) with arms (3, 4) each having an outer transverse slot (5, 6) with a triangular cross-section having an angle of about 90 , which slot forms the folding axis of the U-shaped element. In the closed position, the hinge cannot be seen from outside said members (9, 10).

<CLAIMS>
Double articulation hinge with lateral offset
when open at 180°, moulded in one single piece,

whose ends are each respectively able to be
embedded in one of the two elements (9, 10) to be

articulated, the said hinge being made up of a
tongue showing, in opened-out state, two grooves

(5, 6) of a triangular section of opening of about
90° forming a tongue folding axis, hinge

characterised in that the said tongue (1) is, in
opened-out state, in the shape of a U each leg (3,

4) of which externally show one of the said
grooves (5, 6), the distance between the legs of

the U being at least equal to the sum of the
thicknesses of the walls (15, 16) of the

articulated elements (9, 10) between the outside
and the legs of the U, whose ends are respectively

embedded therein.
Hinge, as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in
that in an opened position the edges of the walls

of the articulated elements practically reach the
bottom (2) of the U of the tongue.
Hinge, as claimed in one of Claims 1 to 3,

characterised in that in a closed position each
one of the two elements internally show an

accommodation (13, 14) for the corresponding
folded back legs of the U of the tongue. 
Hinge, as claimed in one of Claims 1 to 3,

characterised in that it bears a temporary
retaining means (17-18, 17'-18') which is

resiliently surmountable, cooperating with the
complementary means of the articulated elements in

order to impose a predetermined sequence upon
folding and unfolding of the legs of the U when

opening and closing the hinge respectively.
Hinge, as claimed in Claim 4, characterised in
that the retaining means are made up of

complementary reliefs and hollows (17-18, 17'-18')
formed respectively in the walls of the elements

and the hinge coming reciprocally into contact
during the operations of opening and closing.
Hinge, as claimed in one of Claims 1 to 5,

characterised in that it is made of polypropylene.
