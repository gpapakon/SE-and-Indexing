<ABSTRACT>
A print material handling system (10) is described which comprises an input tray 
(12), and an output tray (14), with the trays having at least one common side wall (20) 

which is adjustable laterally relative to the other side wall (18) such that adjustment of 
the moveable side wall simultaneously adjusts the width of the input and the output trays. 

As the moveable wall (20) is adjusted, the support structures defining the bottom (50) 
of the input and the bottom (48) of the output tray are simultaneously adjusted such that 

the input and output trays support print material of various widths. Additionally, the 
invention includes at least one retractable wing (78) positioned on one of the side walls 

(18). The wing can be manufactured in a relatively narrow width because the wing will 
always be positioned adjacent a print material side edge due to the simultaneous 

adjustment of the input (12) and output trays (14).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to input and output trays for 
printers. More particularly, the invention concerns an apparatus that provides input and 
output trays having at least one commonly operative adjustable side wall such that 
adjustment of the wall simultaneously adjusts the width of the input and output trays to 
accommodate various widths of print material. Conventionally, printers have input trays for feeding print medium, also 
called print material, or print media, to a printer and output trays for receiving print 
medium from the printer. These input and output trays are often called cassettes. 
Typically, a printer may have several input trays including an input tray for 8½ x 11-inch 
print medium, 8½ x 14-inch print medium, and a tray to accommodate business size 
envelopes. In use, an operator must remove the currently employed cassette and insert 
the new cassette each time print material of a different dimension is fed to the printer. 
This system of numerous input cassettes resulted in added expense to the operator who 
was required to purchase a cassette for each size print material used. The numerous 
input cassette system also required ample storage space for storing the extra input 
cassettes during nonuse. Additionally, the system resulted in operator inefficiency in that 
the operator was required to repeatedly remove and insert different sized input cassettes. To increase efficiency, input trays were developed having an adjustable wall 
such that a single input tray would accommodate various sized print material for feed to 
a printer. Copiers were manufactured with adjustable guide rails such that the feed area 
of the copier could be adjusted for the input of various sized print material. This design 
of an adjustable input tray or input feed area resulted in improved operator efficiency 
and a lower manufacturing cost over the multiple input tray design. However, in the 
adjustable input tray design, as the input tray size was adjusted, the output tray 
dimensions were unchanged. In printers that use a wet ink printing process, freshly printed ink on print 
material must be given sufficient time to dry before a second sheet of print material is 
fed from the printer onto the top of the freshly printed material. If the ink is not dry, 
it will be smeared by the sheet placed on top of the still wet sheet. In response, printer  
 
output trays were designed with wings extending inwardly from each side of the output 
tray. In operation, a freshly printed sheet is fed

<CLAIMS>
A print material handling system (10) comprising: an 
input region (12) for holding material (60) prior to 

printing, and an output region (14) for receiving material 
after printing, the output region (14) and the input region 

(12) having first (18) and second (20) end walls, at least 
one of the end walls (20) being commonly operative and 

adjustable such that adjustment of said adjustable end wall 
(20) simultaneously varies the width of the input region 

(12) and the width of the output region (14) such that the 
regions accommodate various widths of print material, 

wherein at least one of the said regions further includes a 
first adjustable support structure (50) operatively 

connected between the first and second end walls (18,20) 
such that adjustment of the said adjustable wall (20) varies 

the width of the support structure (50) such that the 
support structure supports print material of various widths. 
The print material handling system (10) of claim 1, 
wherein the first support structure (50) includes a 

plurality of spaced elongate members extending between the 
said adjustable end wall (20) and the other end wall (18). 
The print material handling system (10) of claim 1 or 
claim 2, wherein the system further comprises a drive 

mechanism (82) coupled to a moveable wing (78), the moveable 
wing positioned on one of the said walls (18), and a second 

wing (80) positioned on the other said wall (20) such that 
print material from a printer is received on the wings and 

thereafter the drive mechanism (82) moves the moveable wing 
(78) allowing the print material to fall off the wings and 

into the output region (14). 
The print material handling system (10) of any one of 
claims 1 to 3, wherein the first support structure (50) and 

a region of the said walls define the input region (12).  
 
The print material handling system (10) of any one of 
claims 1 to 4, wherein the system further comprises a second 

adjustable support structure (48), the second support 
structure (48) and another region of the said walls defining 

the output region (14). 
The print material handling system (10) of claim 5, 
wherein the second support structure (48) includes a 

plurality of spaced elongate members extending between the 
said end walls. 
The print material handling system (10) of any one of 
the preceding claims, wherein one of the said end walls (18) 

is stationary and the other said end wall (20) is adjustable 
laterally relative to the stationary end wall to accommodate 

various widths of print material. 
The print material handling system (10) of claim 7, 
wherein adjustment of the said adjustable end wall (20) 

varies the width of the first support structure (50) and the 
width of the second support structure (48). 
The print material handling system (10) of any one of 
the preceding claims, wherein adjustment of the said 

adjustable end wall (20) simultaneously varies the width of 
the input region (12) and the width of the output region 

(14) such that the input region (12) has substantially the 
same width as the output region (14).
