<ABSTRACT>
A video input signal (IN) is applied to a bridged-T 
attenuator (R1,R2,R3,20) which includes a non-linear element (20) in 

the shunt branch thereof that provides increasing attenuation as the 
input signal increases to thereby produce a gamma corrected video 

output signal at the attenuator output. A current sensor in the shunt 
branch generates an exponentially increasing detail signal (S3) for 

increases in the video input signal. The detail signal is high pass 
filtered (24) and combined with the gamma corrected signal (S7) by 

a summing circuit (18) for providing a video output signal (OUT) 
having gamma correction and high frequency detail augmentation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to television systems generally and video signals. In
an ideal television system the light output produced by a kinescope would be
linearly related to the light applied to a camera pick-up tube. However, in practical
systems, the camera tube and the display tube are both non- linear devices, and the
overall camera/display net "gamma" (which represents the curvature of the transfer
function) differs from a value of unity which would be necessary for linear
response.The non-linearities, if uncorrected, would tend to reduce the contrast and to
make detail in dark picture areas almost invisible while the whites would tend to be
amplified to the point of picture tube saturation and blooming. Correction of non-linearities
(i.e., gamma correction) requires non-linear processing of the video
signal to be displayed.An example of conventional gamma correction apparatus is described by
Haferl in European Patent Application 0 427 564 A3 entitled VIDEO SIGNAL
PROCESSING which was published 15 May 1991. In the Haferl apparatus a video
signal to be gamma corrected is applied directly to a summing circuit via a linear
signal path (e.g., a resistor). The video signal is also applied to a non-linear signal
splitter which generates a first gamma correction signal for black to gray picture
areas and a second gamma correction signal for gray to white picture areas. The
first and second gamma correction signals are coupled via respective ones of a DC
signal coupling path and an AC signal coupling path to the summing circuit. This
system, however, is relatively complicated in requiring splitting of the gamma
processing into level dependent ranges.Another example of gamma correction apparatus is described by Monahan
in US patent No. 4,057,828 entitled CONTRAST COMPRESSION CIRCUITS
which issued 8 November 1977. In the Monahan apparatus wide band video signal
to be compressed is first cored to remove noise. A compression difference signal is
then developed by processing the wide band video signal with a conventional
gamma circuit and subtracting the wide band video signal from the processed
signal. An analog multiplication circuit receives the difference signal and
multiplies it by a picture gamma control signal. The controlled difference signal is
then added back to the uncored wide band signal to provide the amplitude
compressed wide band signal. Compression is controlled by varying the factor by
which the difference signal is multiplied. This system, however, is relatively
complicated in requiring
