<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a current-controlled
resonant tunneling semiconductor diode according to the preamble
of claim 1.A resonant tunneling semiconductor diode of the aforementioned
kind is known from document Patent Abstracts of Japan,
Vol. 13, No. 578 (E-864), 20 December 1989 & JP-A-01241870.Diodes are well-known in the art of electronic devices.
Resonant tunneling diodes (RTDs) are characterized by non-linear
current-voltage (I-V) relationships which display a negative
differential resistance over a known domain of voltage values.
Negative differential resistance exists when, over a limited
range of current values, the current exhibits a decrease in
value while, over the corresponding voltage domain, the value
of the voltage is increased. Diodes known in the art include
semiconductor tunnel diodes and voltage controlled RTDs which
have been employed as switches and oscillators, among other
applications.A voltage controlled resonant tunneling diode is a variety
of RTD characterized by a negative differential current-voltage
relationship when the voltage is swept through a wide range
of values and the current is measured. Specifically, over a
known current range, RTDs show an actual decrease in the value
of the current when the voltage values are increased indicating
a negative differential resistance over this domain of voltage
values. Typically, prior art RTDs have comprised a double barrier-quantum
well structure. In one example, a gallium arsenide
quantum well layer will have relatively thin barriers of aluminum
arsenide epitaxially joined to each side of the quantum well
layer. The resulting structure will then be placed between two
injection layers comprised of gallium arsenide. The injection
layers provide a reservoir of electrons for the device.The resonant tunneling element known from the prior art document
mentioned above comprises InAsxSb1-x (0.9 ≤ x ≤ 1) as
the material of the quantum well region for electrons and
AlzGa1-zSbyAs1-y (0.9 ≤ y ≤ 1, 0 ≤ z ≤ 1) as the material for the
barrier layers. The composition parameters x and y are set to
the designated ranges so as to suppress lattice defects.In IEEE Electron Device Letters, Vol. 11, No. 1, January
1990, pp. 27-29 an InAs/AlSb double-barrier structure with large
peak-to-valley current ratio is disclosed exhibiting a negative
differential resistance.In prior art RTDs, the barrier layers prevent the free
flow of electrons through the device when a voltage is applied
to the diode. When a voltage is applied to the diode,
