<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a method for making an offset 
printing plate according to the silver salt diffusion transfer 

process comprising the steps of: 

(a) image-wise exposing an imaging element comprising (i) a 
hydrophilic base, (ii) an image receiving layer containing physical 

development nuclei, (iii) an intermediate layer, and (iv) a silver 
halide emulsion layer, 
(b) applying an aqueous alkaline solution to the imaging element in 
the presence of (a) developing agent(s) and (a) silver halide 

solvent(s) to form image-wise in said image receiving layer a silver 
image, 
(c) treating the imaging element to remove the layer(s) on top of 
said image receiving layer,

 
characterized in that said imaging element has been stored before 

image-wise exposure in a surrounding having at 22°C a relative 
humidity between 20% and 50%. 
According to the present invention there is also provided a 
package of the imaging element, making said imaging element suitable 

for use in the above defined method.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for making improved
offset printing plates according to the silver salt diffusion
transfer process. Furthermore the present invention relates to a
package of imaging elements suitable for use in the method defined
above.The principles of the silver complex diffusion transfer reversal
process, hereinafter called DTR-process, have been described e.g. in
US-P 2,352,014 and in the book "Photographic Silver Halide Diffusion
Processes" by André Rott and Edith Weyde - The Focal Press - London
and New York, (1972).In the DTR-process non-developed silver halide of an
information-wise exposed photographic silver halide emulsion layer
material is transformed with a so-called silver halide solvent into
soluble silver complex compounds which are allowed to diffuse into
an image receiving layer and are reduced therein with a developing
agent, generally in the presence of physical development nuclei, to
form a silver image having reversed image density values
("DTR-image") with respect to the black silver image obtained in the
exposed areas of the photographic material.A DTR-image bearing material can be used as a planographic
printing plate wherein the DTR-silver image areas form the
water-repellant ink-receptive areas on a water-receptive
ink-repellant background. The DTR-image can be formed in the image
receiving layer of a sheet or web material which is a separate
element with respect to the photographic silver halide emulsion
material (a so-called two-sheet DTR element) or in the image
receiving layer of a so-called single-support-element, also called
mono-sheet element, which contains at least one photographic silver
halide emulsion layer integral with an image receiving layer in
waterpermeable relationship therewith. It is the latter mono-sheet
version which is preferred for the preparation of offset printing
plates by the DTR method.Two main types of mono-sheet DTR imaging elements exist. 
According to a first type disclosed in e.g. US-P-4,722,535 and GB-1,241,661
a support is provided in the order given with a silver
halide emulsion layer and a layer containing physical development
nuclei serving as the image-receiving layer. After information-wise
exposure and development the imaged element is used as a printing
plate without the removal of the emulsion layer. Printing plates
of this type have a low printing endurance typically around 10000
copies.According to a second type a hydrophilic support, mostly
anodized aluminium, is provided in the order given with a layer
