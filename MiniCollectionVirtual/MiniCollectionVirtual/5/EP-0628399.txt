<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a discontinuous process for making plastic laminate tubes for packaging containers. The process according to the invention allows tubes to be made from laminates purely of plastic whose welds have the same strength and appearance as plastic-metal laminates.

<CLAIMS>
A process for the production of a tubular hollow body of a
plastic foil from a blank which represents the hollow body in its

geometrical development and whose overlapping edges are fused by means
of a high-frequency field, pressed in the fused condition by the

application of pressure, and then cooled, characterised in that the
high-frequency field is divided into a field (F1) which acts on the top

side of the overlap (15) at a field (F2) which acts on the underside of
the overlap (15).
A process according to claim 1 characterised in that for
fusing of the top side and underside of the overlap (15), the fields

(F1, F2) are introduced into an upper metal strip (22) which heats up
and a lower metal strip (28) which heats up.
A process according to claim 1 or claim 2 characterised in
that the metal strips (22, 28) are heated up to different levels by

suitable allocation of the fields (F1, F2).
A process according to claim 3 characterised in that, by
reducing the width of the upper metal strip (22), while the width of the

lower metal strip (28) remains the same, more energy is introduced into
the lower metal strip.
