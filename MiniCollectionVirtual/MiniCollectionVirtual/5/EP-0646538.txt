<ABSTRACT>
A speed variable moving sidewalk for conveying passengers 
includes an endless circulating path having inverting sections, 

a high-speed section and speed variable sections, and a large 
number of treadboards moving along the circulating path. Each 

treadboard can move independently as being guided by guide 
rails and has hooks on its underside which engage shafts of a 

driving chain for inverting section. The treadboard further 
has hooks on its underside which engage shafts of a rack chain 

in order to be driven in the high-speed section and a roller 
for transversely sliding relative to the neighboring 

treadboard. A handrail mechanism for the speed variable moving 
sidewalk includes: with the total length of the moving sidewalk 

being divided into plural portions, a multiple-number of 
independent moving handrail portions for allowing passengers to 

hold thereon, being arranged for the respective portions of the 
sidewalk while all of the moving handrail portio
ns are arranged 
without overlapping with one another.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a moving sidewalk in
which endlessly disposed treadboards are successively
transported circularly while being transversely slid within a
plane so that moving speeds of the treadboards may accelerate
or retard.Fig. 13 is a partially sectional side view showing a conventional speed
variable moving sidewalk. Such a conventional speed variable moving sidewalk is
shown in e.g. Japanese patent provisional publication number 47-3368,
corresponding to Swiss application No. 10911/70 or in Japanese patent
provisional publication number 47-669, corresponding to US Patent No.
3, 695,183. Fig. 14 is a
detailed view showing a portion designated by A in Fig. 13.
Fig.15 is a side view illustrating a principle of a typical
driving system for the conventional moving sidewalk. In the
figures, numerals 61 and 62 designate treadboards and guide
rails, respectively. The system further includes guide rollers
63, link rods 64, driving motors 75, rubber tires 82 and
driving motors 83. The speed variable moving sidewalk is constructed such
that treadboards are made to move in a forward or backward
direction within a plane while moving speeds of the treadboards
are accelerated or retarded by sliding the treadboards
transversely with respect to the advancing direction thereof.
In Fig.13, treadboards 61 move forward or backward and right or
left along the guide rail 62. Since each treadboard 61 is
connected with adjacent treadboards 61 as shown in Figs.13 and
14, a link of the treadboards 61 may be considered to be a kind
of a chain loop. In order to drive the looped treadboards 61,
a plurality of rubber tires 82 being rotated are brought into
contact with the lower side of the treadboards 61, whereby the
frictional forces given by the tires conveys the treadboards
61. The treadboards in inverting sections are also driven in
the same manner. In some embodiments, the treadboards may be
driven using a liner motor 91 as illustrated in Fig.18.The conventional system includes a treadboard aligning
mechanism, as shown in Fig.19 (a side view) and Fig.20 (a
transverse sectional view). More specifically, the treadboards
61 are aligned and conveyed along guides 74 while cam followers
73 attached to treadboards 61 being engaged with threaded cams
72. This mechanism is driven by motors 75 which rotate
threaded cams 72. Accordingly, the driving system of the whole
sidewalk includes in total five driving motors, that is, two
driving motors 75 for the inverting sections and three driving
motors 83 for driving

<CLAIMS>
A speed variable moving sidewalk for conveying passengers on the
upper face thereof, comprising:


an endlessly continuous circulating path extending longitudinally
and vertically, comprising:


a pair of inverting sections which are disposed at opposite
ends of the sidewalk and each composed of arced guide rails

(36) arranged within vertical planes,
a high-speed section which is disposed at a center portion
of the sidewalk and composed of horizontally extending and

substantially straight guide rails (14), and
a pair of speed variable sections which are each disposed
between said inverting sections and said high-speed section

and composed of curving guide rails (29 (14), 44 (14))
arranged within horizontal planes;
and a large number of treadboards (1) adapted to move along said
circulating path, said treadboards (1) being inverted as proceeding

vertically in said inverting sections, being transferred horizontally
in a longitudinal direction in said high-speed section and being

transversely slid right or left relative to neighboring treadboards in
said speed variable sections so that said treadboards (1) accelerate

or retard to allow passengers to step onto or off from an upper face
at end portions of the sidewalk;

characterized by

a pair of driving chains (6) for the inverting sections which
each are adapted for endlessly circulating in a vertical plane

and are disposed inside the guide rails (36) in said
respective inverting sections disposed at the end portions; 
a pair of driving chains (5) for the high-speed section each
of which is adapted for endlessly circulating in a vertical

plane and is disposed inside the guide rails (14) in opposite
ends of said high-speed section;
a rack chain (4) which is disposed inside the guide rails and
outside said pair of driving chains (5) for the high-speed

section and which is adapted for endlessly circulating in a
vertical plane across a whole part of said high-speed section

by engaging said pair of driving chains (5) for the high-speed
section; and
a pair of motors (11) for line driving each of which is
disposed at respective extremes of said circulating path and

connected to one of said driving chains (5) for the high-speed
section through a line shaft (12) with a reducing gear

(13) so as to drive a corresponding driving chain (5) for the
high-speed section at an appropriately reduced speed,

wherein each treadboard (1) is adapted to move independently of
neighboring treadboards (1) as being guided by said guide rails (14), and

each of said treadboards (1) comprises: means (8) on an underside thereof
which engage shafts (6a) of said driving chain (6) for the inverting section

in order to drive the treadboard (1) at the inverting section; means (7) on
the underside thereof which engage shafts (25) of said rack chain (4) in

order to drive the treadboard (1) in the high-speed section; and a roller
(52) disposed in a portion of each treadboard (1), the roller of treadboard (1) being

in contact with a
neighboring treadboard (1) in order to enable each treadboard (1) to

transversely slide relative to the neighboring treadboard (1) when in the speed
variable section.
