<ABSTRACT>
Partially cross-linked polyolefin compositions are 
disclosed, which are prepared by dynamic cross-linking and 

comprise (percentages by weight): 

1) 5-50% of a crystalline propylene homopolymer or copolymer;

partially soluble in xylene at ambient temperature, 

containing ethylene, propylene and/or another α-olefin. 
 
Said compositions contain from 20% to 92% of a fraction soluble 

in xylene at ambient temperature, wherein the ethylene is 
present in quantities lower than or equal to 35%.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to soft partially cross-linked
polyolefin compositions having very low flexural modulus
values.Thanks to high elongation at break values which
characterize them, together with good compression set and
tension set values, the compositions of the present invention
are suitable for the manufacture of soft and flexible products
with good elastic properties, such as small tubes used in the
medical field. Moreover, thanks to their high flowability in
the molten state and their excellent workability in general,
the above mentioned compositions can be adequately used in
slush molding processes currently employed for the production
of synthetic leathers to be used mainly in the automotive
industry. The high elongation at break values allow one also
to subject to thermoforming the extruded and/or calendered
sheets obtained from the above mentioned compositions, without
encountering problems related to thinning and loss of embossing
in the folding areas like in cases, for example, when the
product is used for covering instrument panels for automobiles.The above mentioned characteristics and properties are
obtained by subjecting to dynamic cross-linking heterophasic
polyolefin compositions which are not cross-linked, said
compositions containing crystalline propylene homopolymers or
copolymers and elastomeric olefin polymers with a low ethylene
content (less than or equal to 35% by weight in the fraction 
soluble in xylene at ambient temperature).US-A-4,247,652 relates to foamed products obtained from partially
cross-linked polyolefin compositions. The said compositions
comprise (1) a cross-linked elastomer with high contents
of ethylene and, optionally, (2) an uncross-linked elastomer
with low contents of ethylene.US patent 4,963,612 describes partially cross-linked
polyolefin compositions comprising a polypropylene fraction
which is not cross-linked and a partially cross-linked
elastomer, wherein the uncross-linked fraction of said
elastomer contains from 25 to 60% by weight of propylene, and
from 40 to 75% by weight of ethylene, if the elastomer does not
contain dienes. In fact, the elastomer is selected from
ethylene/propylene and ethylene/propylene/diene copolymers.
Therefore, the fraction of the above mentioned partially cross-linked
polyolefin compositions which is soluble in xylene at
ambient temperature and which, as shown in the examples,
corresponds to the noncross-linked fraction of the elastomer,
contains not less than 40% by weight of ethylene when the
elastomer is an
