<ABSTRACT>
The femoral implant (1) comprises an intramedullary anchoring stem (10), and its bicondylar part (11) centrally and posteriorly contains a cavity (15), the opening of which is arranged opposite the intercondylar notch (13) which is oriented towards the posterior condyles (16) and in which a cup (14) having a hemispherical opening (14') is arranged; and the tibial implant (2) comprises a tibial base (21) on which is removably fixed a plate (22) made of plastic of the polyethylene type and from which a lug (23) projects, at the end of which lug a spherical head (24) comprising an orifice (25) for this purpose is fastened, the said spherical head (24) having a diameter equal to the opening (14') of the cup (14), so that it can be inserted into the said cup (14).

A knee prosthesis with spherical articulation, particularly a replacement
prosthesis for a previously implanted prosthesis, comprising on the one hand

a femoral implant (1) having a condylar part (11) in which is formed a
central cavity (15) which is open with respect to an intercondylar notch (13)

and in which is arranged a cup (14) having a hemispherical opening (14'),
and on the other hand a tibial implant (2) comprising a tibial seating (21) on

which is fixed a plate (22) made plastic material, a lug (23) also forming a
projection of the tibial seating between the aforementioned plates,

characterised in that the cup (14) contains a spherical head (24) the diameter
of which is equal to the opening (14') of the cup (14) and which has an

orifice (25) allowing the lug to be covered by said spherical head.
A prosthesis according to claim 1, characterised in that the cup (14) is
extended by edges (17) in which are hollowed out two grooves (18, 19), the

width of which allows the passage of the lug (23), said grooves being
diametrically opposed with respect to the intercondylar notch (13).
A prosthesis according to claim 1, characterised in that the cup (14) is a
retaining cup such as to retain the spherical head (24).
A prosthesis according to any of the preceding claims, characterised in that
the cup (14) is freely movable within the cavity (15).
A prosthesis according to any of the preceding claims, characterised in that
the spherical head (24) is fixed to the lug (23) by conical coupling.
A prosthesis according to any of the preceding claims, characterised in that
the plate (22) is capable of rotational and translational movement on the

tibial seating (21). 
A prosthesis according to any of the preceding claims, characterised in that
the plate (22) is formed from two half-plates placed on either side of the

central lug (23).
A prosthesis according to any of the preceding claims, characterised in that
the femoral implant (1) comprises a trochlear part (13') extending its

bicondylar part (11).
