<ABSTRACT>
An ink jet recording head formed by laminating and fixing: a 
flow path forming plate (3) having through holes (3a) for 

defining pressure producing chambers (9), ink supply inlets 
(10), and a common ink chamber, a nozzle plate (2) having 

nozzle openings (1) communicating with the pressure producing 
chambers (9), and a vibration plate (4) having diaphragm 

portions (4e) that are resiliently deformed in response to 
displacement of piezoelectric vibration elements (6) one upon 

another with an adhesive so as to be watertight. The 
vibration plate (4) has frame-like thick wall portions 

(4b,4c,4d) that extend as far as to the ink supply inlet (10) 
side of the pressure producing chamber (9) as well as to the 

inner side of the nozzle opening (1), and portions closer to 
a piezoelectric vibration element (6) than to both ends of 

the pressure producing chamber (9) are made to be supported 
by a base (7). As a result of this construction, a 

nonsupported region of the pressure producing chamber (9) can 
be shortened, which in turn improves the rigidity of a 

substrate unit (5) as a whole.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an ink jet recording head and a
substrate unit for an ink jet recording head that jets droplets
of ink by displacing a vibration plate using piezoelectric
vibration elements.An ink jet recording head using a piezoelectric
vibration element of vertical vibration mode as a drive source,
requiring only a small area of abutment of the piezoelectric
vibration element against the vibration plate, can achieve an
arrangement density of a pressure producing chamber as high as
90 dpi or more.As shown in Fig. 14, such a recording head is
fabricated into a single body by integrally fixing a substrate
unit K to a base L. The substrate unit K is formed by
laminating and fixing a flow path forming plate D, a nozzle
plate F, and a vibration plate J with an adhesive so as to be
watertight. The base L has a piezoelectric vibration element
G, an ink supply pipe, and the like attached thereto. The flow
path forming plate D has through holes defining a pressure
producing chamber A, an ink supply inlet B, and a common ink
chamber C; the nozzle plate F has a nozzle opening E 
communicating with the pressure producing chamber A; and the
vibration plate J has a diaphragm portion H that is resiliently
deformed in response to displacement of the piezoelectric
vibration element G.In the thus constructed ink jet recording head, the
substrate unit must be fixed to the base so as to cause the
diaphragm portion H to confront the base so that the diaphragm
portion H can be abutted against the tip of the piezoelectric
vibration element G. For this reason, the substrate unit is
fixed to the base L so as to keep away from the pressure
producing chamber A so that the base L does not come in contact
with the diaphragm portion H.To improve the pressure producing chamber arrangement
density in an attempt to increase resolution, the length of the
pressure producing chamber A must be increased in the axial
direction since a predetermined capacity of the pressure
producing chamber A must be ensured. However, the region
confronting the pressure producing chamber A is a nonsupported
region S1 that is not supported by the base L, and this region
is long. As a result, when such region is given a
predetermined displacement "a" by the piezoelectric vibration
element G to jet a droplet of ink, the nonsupported region S1
of the substrate unit K becomes susceptible to flexion as shown
by the broken lines in Fig. 14, thereby imposing the problem of
impairing printing quality.In addition, positional accuracy of the abutment of the
