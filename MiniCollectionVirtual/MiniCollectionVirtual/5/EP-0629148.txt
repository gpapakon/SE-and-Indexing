5 comprising a first and a second sealing door (K1 and 

K2, respectively), 

the first and the second sealing door (K1 and K2, 
respectively) being located behind one another and 

behind the aperture (2) in the transport path of the 
support (4), and 
the sealing doors (K1 and K2) closing the transport path 
in the closed state. 
The transport device according to any one of claims 1 to 
5, characterized in that the transport unit is provided 

at least in duplicate as first and second transport 
unit, wherein the second transport unit is located behind 

the first transport unit and behind the medium 
container (3) and the support (4) can be received by the  

 
second transport unit and transported to a second 

aperture. 
The transport device according to claim 8, characterized 
by two sealing doors (K2) which are located behind the 

first aperture (2) and in front of the second 
aperture (2), respectively, in the transport path of the 

support (4) and close the transport path (1) in the 
closed state. 
The transport device according to claim 8 comprising 
first to fourth sealing doors (K1 to K4), 


the first and second sealing doors (K1 and K2, 
respectively) being located behind one another and 

behind the first aperture (2) in the transport path of 
said support, 
the third and fourth sealing doors being located behind 
one another in the transport path of said support and in 

front of a second aperture, and 
the sealing doors closing the transport path in the 
closed state. 
The transport device according to any one of claims 1 to 
10, characterized in that a device for precipitating 

vaporous soldering medium is provided between the 
aperture(s) (2) and the sealing door(s). 
The transport device according to any one of claims 1 to 
11, characterized in that the apertures (2) can be 

closed in a sealing manner preferably by doors (2a).

aperture (2) onto the support (4) while the first 

sealing door (K1) is open and the second sealing 
door (K2) is closed, 
b) moving the support (4) through the aperture of the 
first sealing door (K1) to the second sealing 

door (K2), 
c) closing the aperture (2), 
d) opening the second sealing door (K2), 
e) moving the support (4) through the aperture of the 
second sealing door (K2), 
f) closing the first sealing door (K1) behind the 
support (4), 
g) moving the support (4) until it is immersed into the 
medium container (3), 
h) moving the support (4) back to the first sealing 
door (K1) after the soldering process, 
i) opening the first sealing door (K1), 
j) moving the support (4) through the aperture of the 
first sealing door (K1), 
k) closing the second sealing door (K2) behind the 
support (4), and
