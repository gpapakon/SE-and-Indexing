<ABSTRACT>
Holders for vehicles, especially antenna holders, are known having a support on which a fastening element in the form of a suction foot and a retaining element for a unit to be fastened are arranged, the support having at least one limb on which the suction foot is fastened, the suction foot having a suction plate and an operating element which shifts the suction plate over a bolt part and has at least two mutually opposite gripping surfaces. In order to create a holder (1) which has a suction foot (12) which can be fastened easily and at the same time securely on a smooth surface, for example the window pane of a vehicle, with the assistance of only one hand of an operator, the operating element has a control knob (9) which has conical surfaces as gripping surfaces (21), the control knob having on its side facing the support a larger diameter in the region of the gripping surfaces than on its side facing away from the support, and the bolt part (14) can be shifted via at least one guide part (24), which is guided on a guide surface (23), the guide part being physically assigned either to the support or to the control knob and the guide surface being physically assigned to the respective other part of the support and control knob, and the guide surface having a gradient in the direction of the rotation axis of the bolt part.
