<ABSTRACT>
A landing gear door assembly for an aircraft, having a closed
position to cover the door opening through which the landing gear

moves between its stowed and operating position. The door
assembly comprises two panel sections, each of which is rotated

by a related positioning section so as to rotate about a center of
rotation from the closed positions upwardly and outwardly into the

aircraft structure to the open position. In one arrangement, each
panel section is made up of an inside and outside panel which are

hinge mounted with respect to one another. These move in a
manner that the outer panel moves in a path deviating from a

straight rotational path to provide better clearance with the aircraft
structure. In another arrangement, each panel section is rigid and

is rotated about a fixed axis of rotation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to aircraft landing
gear, and more particularly to such a landing gear which is
particularly adapted to be used with larger aircraft and
provide proper ground clearance and also clearance for
inspection and maintenance of the landing gear.More specifically, the present invention relates to a
landing gear door assembly for a landing gear of an airplane,
where the landing gear has a stowed position in the airplane
and an operating position, said airplane having a landing
gear door opening which is defined at least in part by first
and second door opening edge structures, and through which
the landing gear travels on a travel path moving between its
stowed and operating positions, said door assembly
comprising:
a) first and second door assembly sections positioned
in side by side relationship;b) each door assembly section comprising a panel
section comprising at least one panel which has a closed
position extending at least partially across said door
opening;c) each door assembly section having a positioning
section operatively connected to said panel section to place
said panel section in an open position by moving said panel
section outwardly and upwardly with a rotational component of
travel to pass by one of said of door opening edge structures
to extend at least partially into said door opening and at
least partially above said one of said door opening edge 
structures, and to be clear of the travel path of the landing
gear. Such an assembly is known from US-A-2,457,625.Airplanes commonly have retractable landing gear,
where the landing gear has a stowed position within the
airplane structure, and an operating position where the
landing gear extends from the airplane structure so that the
landing gear wheels can properly engage the ground surface.
Accordingly, the fuselage of the airplane (or other body
carrying the landing gear) is provided with landing gear well
doors which remain closed during flight, but are opened
before landing to permit the landing gear to be moved to its
operating position for ground engagement upon landing of the
airplane.Proper utilization of space is, of course, very
important for most all aircraft. Also, it is necessary to
provide the various components of the airplane with proper
access and clearance for maintenance, repair, etc. With
landing gear, for example, it is desirable that when the
airplane is on the ground, the landing gear doors and other
components are positioned to provide proper clearance to
facilitate wheel inspection and
