<ABSTRACT>
A NaCl oxide thin layer oriented to (100) face or a 
spinel oxide thin layer oriented to (100) face, a perovskite 

dielectric thin layer oriented to (100) face and a metal 
electrode are sequentially laminated on a metal electrode, thus 

providing a thin film capacitor. Or alternatively, a thin film 
capacitor is manufactured by sequentially laminating a NaCl oxide 

thin layer oriented to (100) face or a spinel oxide thin layer 
oriented to (100) face, a platinum thin layer as a lower 

electrode oriented to (100) face, a perovskite dielectric thin 
layer oriented to (100) face and a metal thin layer as an upper 

electrode on a substrate. A plasma-enhanced CVD method is 
applied to form a NaCl oxide thin layer, a spinel oxide thin 

layer and a perovskite dielectric thin layer while a vacuum 
deposition method, a sputtering method, a CVD method or a plasma-enhanced 

CVD method is applied for the formation of a metal 
electrode.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a thin film capacitor and a
method of manufacturing the same.Barium titanate (BaTiO3) ceramics having a perovskite
crystal structure have been widely used as capacitor materials
and the like, since they have high resistivities and superior
dielectric properties. Strontium titanate (SrTiO3) becomes
cubical at about a temperature higher than 110K, and is
paraelectric. Ceramics mainly made from strontium titanate have
lower dielectric constants than the barium titanate ceramics.
However, the strontium titanate ceramics have better temperature
characteristics and less dielectric loss than the barium
titanate ceramics.The curie points of ceramics can be shifted by employing
an additive such as barium, lead or the like, thus providing
paraelectric ceramics with a high dielectric constant at room
temperature. These ceramics have been widely used for high
frequency range and high voltage capacitors. Because complex
perovskite compounds such as Pb(Mg1/3, Nb2/3)O3 and Pb{(Mg1/3,
Nb2/3)1-YTiY}O3 have higher dielectric constants and better
direct current biases than barium titanate dielectrics, they
are used for small multilayer capacitors with high capacitance
and the like. As the demand for small, lightweight electronic
components and highly integrated semiconductor devices increases,
research in forming thin films of oxide materials having a
perovskite structure and large dielectric constants such as
barium titanate dielectric materials, strontium titanate
dielectric materials, Pb{(Mg1/3, Nb2/3)1-YTiY}O3 dielectric
materials and the like has been actively carried out in order to
manufacture small high-volume capacitors.As a method of forming thin layers, a sputtering method
has been conventionally applied. (For example, the method is
disclosed in K. Iijima et al., J. Appl. Phys., vol. 60, No.1,
pp.361-367 (1986).) However, this method is slow in forming
layers (<10nm/min), requires expensive monocrystal substrates
such as MgO and is poor in controlling the compositions of
layers.A sol-gel method, which has been intensively researched
recently, on the other hand, is excellent in controlling the
compositions of layers and suitable for forming multicomponent
thin layers. However, this method provides layers with poor
quality and coverage over uneven surfaces so that it cannot be
applied as an industrial manufacturing technique.A CVD (chemical vapor deposition) method is excellent in
controlling the compositions of layers, and can form layers on
substrates having large surface areas. The
