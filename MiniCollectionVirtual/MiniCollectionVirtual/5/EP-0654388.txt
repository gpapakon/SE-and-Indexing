<ABSTRACT>
A pick-up device for rescue systems on aerial ropeway systems with feed means is described. According to the invention the device comprises:   - a securing means (4) which can be mounted on one of the feed means,   - at least one guide roller (15, 16) which is rotatably supported by the securing means (4), - a flexible cord (18), a central section of which is supported by the at least one guide roller (15, 16) and at least one of whose strands (19, 20) is wound, after the at least one roller (15, 16) on a winding roller (21, 22), - a support (24) which is connected to the securing means (4) in such a way that the winding rollers (21, 22) are moved into a stable position and the latter are freed in such a way that, as the strand (19, 20) of cord is unwound they drop downwards such that a double cord reaching to the ground is formed.
