<ABSTRACT>
A reactor for conducting a continuous multi-phase catalytic reaction such as the conversion of syngas to higher hydrocarbon fuels. Gaseous reactants are introduced via a gas-permeable plate (15) into a slurry (16) which includes the product and a finely divided catalyst. The liquid product is separated from the remainder of the slurry by means of a filter unit (13) including a filter member (22). A pressure differential is established across the filter member (22) by means of a constant level device (23) within the filter unit which maintains a level of filtrate (32) within the filter unit (22) below the level of the slurry (16). The slurry (16) is maintained in a constant state of agitation by the introduction of the gaseous components as a steam of bubbles. Fluctuations in the pressure differential across the filter member (22) prevent the filter member from clogging and the gas spaces (28, 29) above the filtrate (32) and the slurry (16) are in communication.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a reactor for 
conducting a continuous multi-phase catalytic reaction 
and is particularly, though not exclusively, applicable 
to the catalytic conversion of syngas, produced by the 
reforming of methane, to hydrocarbon fuels, by a 
Fischer-Tropsh type of synthesis. Other reaction 
systems for which the apparatus would be suitable 
include various slurry reactions for the production of 
petrochemicals, the production of oxygenates from 
synthesis gas and dehydrogenation reactions. Three-phase catalytic reaction systems are used in 
a number of chemical processes and their application in 
the petrochemical industry appears to be increasing. Of 
the three-phase systems in use, mechanically agitated, 
loop and bubble column slurry reactors contain small 
catalyst particles dispersed in the liquid. In most 
applications, the liquid will have to be separated from 
the slurry to remove liquid products or for catalyst 
regeneration purposes. In those cases where the liquid 
is an inert medium, occasionally, it may have to be 
replaced due to degradation or the build-up of 
impurities. Mechanically agitated slurry reactors are 
particularly convenient for batch processes due to the 
low mass-transfer and heat resistance. These features 
also make them suitable for the determination of 
reaction kinetics in the laboratory. A serious 
disadvantage and limitation of this reactor type, 
however, is the difficulty in the separation of  
 
catalyst particles in any continuous operation. Commercially, it is only mechanically agitated 
reactors that are used in the hydrogenation of double 
bonds in oils from cottonseed, soybean,corn, sunflower, 
etc. By employing a nickel catalyst, the products 
include margarine, shortening, soap and greases. The 
choice of reactor is based on the low diffusivities and 
high viscosities of the fatty oils. Fixed-bed 
operation has been proposed due to the advantage of 
completely catalyst-free products without filtration. 
A number of other hydrogenation reactions are also 
carried out in agitated reactors, e.g. the 
hydrogenation of nitro compounds. The operation of bubble column slurry reactors is 
simple,since mechanically moving parts are avoided. 
Combined with the low diffusional resistance and 
efficient heat transfer, these reactors are attractive 
for many industrial processes. However, solid-liquid 
separation is usually performed outside the reactor in 
elaborate filtering and settling systems. The catalyst 
slurry is to be recycled to the
