<ABSTRACT>
System for monitoring and/or 
controlling engine performance of an engine (10) having 

multiple separate cylinders (12-15) each sequentially 
providing a driving force to a common mechanical member (16). 

The system comprises: sensor means (41) for monitoring the 
position of said driven member (16) and developing a 

speed-indicative signal (80,81) indicative of and varying in 
accordance with the speed at which said driven member (16) is 

driven by said multiple cylinders (12-15); means (30) for 
monitoring a predetermined portion of said speed-indicated 

signal, said monitored portion generated in association with 
and during an expected power cycle produced by a first one of 

said cylinders and prior to an expected next sequential power 
cycle of another one of said cylinders; and means for 

developing a signal indicative of the occurrence of knock in 
said first one of said cylinders by determining when 

variations of said monitored portion of said speed-indicative 
signal match expected variations of said monitored 

speed-indicative signal which exist when knock in said first 
cylinder is present.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to the field of 
systems which monitor and/or control multiple cylinder 
engine performance. It is known that detection of engine knock is 
desirable such that engine operating parameters can be 
adjusted to avoid such a condition. Generally, knock 
detection is accomplished in accordance with the output 
of one or more special sensors designed specifically to 
detect engine knock. Some of these sensors detect knock 
by virtue of detecting audible knock sounds or vibrations 
produced by the engine in a single sensor. Other knock 
sensors detect abnormal engine cylinder pressure 
variations in each cylinder. Providing one or more 
additional knock sensors to an engine system results in 
increasing the complexity and cost of such engine 
monitoring/control systems. Some prior systems have proposed that a specific 
type of engine cylinder failure can be detected by 
detailed analysis of the instantaneous engine crankshaft  
 
speed signal produced in response to each cylinder's 
power cycle. In such systems, apparently a certain 
portion of the engine crankshaft speed signal is 
monitored during an associated power cycle of each 
cylinder to create an instantaneous cylinder associated 
speed vector signal. By comparing the variations 
produced in the speed vector signals to some type of 
reference criteria an indication of a single fault, such 
as engine misfire, can be achieved. However, these 
systems do not discuss how it is possible to use such a 
system to determine engine knock or any other type of 
engine cylinder fault or undesired engine cylinder 
performance. One prior engine control system recognized that it 
is desirable to adjust fuel to individual engine 
cylinders so as to obtain power balancing between these 
cylinders such that each cylinder contributes 
approximately the same power with respect to driving the 
engine crankshaft. In this system, the engine crankshaft 
speed was measured at a certain position of each cylinder 
power cycle during an engine idle speed mode. The 
measured crankshaft speed was then compared with the 
known desired engine idle speed, and fuel to each of the 
cylinders was adjusted in an attempt to have each engine 
cylinder achieve the same desired idle speed crankshaft 
speed at the power cycle position at which the crankshaft 
speed was measured. Such a system which uses a known 
desired engine speed would apparently not be usable at 
conditions other than the engine idle speed mode where 
the desired crankshaft speed was known.

A system for monitoring and/or controlling engine
