<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a process for the purification of factor 
IX, factor X, and factor II from human plasma or fractions thereof, 

wherein a solution containing prothrombin complex factors is 
purified by repeated ion exchange chromatographic separations 

followed by adsorption chromatography on metal ions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a process for the purification of
factor IX, factor X, and factor II from human plasma or fractions
thereof containing same by repeated anion exchange chromatographic
separations followed by chromatography on selective adsorption
resin. The process gives highly purified products.A fundamental approach to the treatment of congenital disorders of
coagulation factors consists in the replacement therapy, i.e. the
intravenous admininistration of the deficient factor.The said therapeutic approach requires that coagulation factors
concentrates containing high-activity deficient factor be readily
available in injectable small volumes.The ever increasing importance of said therapy made it topical to
develop processes giving the aforesaid products of improved quality
and purity.The conventional processes utilized so far [Wickerhauser N., Sgouris

Isolation of a factor IX concentrate (prothrombin complex) for
clinical use", Vox Sang., 22, 137-160 (1972); Heystek J.,

of human blood. II. The large scale preparation of prothrombin
complex. A comparison between two methods using the anion exchangers

(1973); Suomela H., Myllyla G., Raaska E.: "Preparation and
properties of a therapeutic factor IX concentrate", Vox Sang., 33,

of human coagulation factors II, IX, and X using sulfated dextran
beads", Meth.Enzymol., 80, 221-228 (1981)] are essentially based on
chromatographic methods giving concentrates of different purity,
consisting of various vitamin-K dependent proteins: factor II
(prothrombin), factor VII (proconvertin), factor IX (Christmas
factor), factor X (Stewart-Prower factor), known as prothrombin
complex factors. Actually, the aforesaid concentrates are commonly
used to treat factors II, IX, and X deficiencies.Within the hemophilic syndrome range (hemophilia A or factor VIII
deficiency, hemophilia B or factor IX deficiecny, hemophilia C or
factor XI deficiency), hemophilia B is the second most important as
for the number of cases and - like hemophilia A - one of the most
serious due to the frequent occurrence of hemorrages.The prolonged administration of prothrombin complex concentrates to
patients suffering from hemophilia B may cause hypercoagulability
and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIVC), probably

<CLAIMS>
Process for the purification of factor IX, factor II and factor X
from human plasma wherein:


a) the supernatant plasma, after cryopaste centrifugation and removal,
is purified by adsorption on anion exchange resin and the adsorbed

product is further eluted;
b) the product collected in step (a) is subjected to viral
inactivation and filtered and the obtained solution is applied again

to an anion exchange column; the non- or weakly-adsorbed proteins
(among which factor X) are washed respectively with a buffer

consisting of 5 mM sodium citrate, 2.5 mM dibasic sodium phosphate,
2.5 mM monobasic potassium phosphate containing 0.19 M sodium chloride

at pH ranging from 6 to 6.5 and with a buffer consisting of 5 mM
sodium citrate, 2.5 mM dibasic sodium phosphate, 2.5 mM monobasic

sodium phosphate containing 0.26 M sodium chloride at pH 6.1 ± 0.1 and
finally the adsorbed products (among which factor IX) is eluted with a

phosphate/citrate buffer containing 0.28 - 0.36 M sodium chloride at
pH 6.1 ± 0.1
c) the product obtained from step (b) is concentrated and diafiltered
and the obtained solution is caused to flow through a column

derivatized with copper ions conditioned with 20-200 mM sodium
acetate, 0.2-1 M sodium chloride at pH 7.2 ± 0.2 and unbond proteins

are removed by washing with the afore said buffer; thereafter factor
II is collected by elution with 20-100 mM sodium acetate, 0.2-1 M

sodium chloride, 40-80 mM glycine at pH 7.2 ± 0.2; factor X is 
collected after the elution of factor II using the same buffer and

finally factor IX is collected by elution with 50 mM sodium acetate,
500 mM sodium chloride and 0.08-0.12 M glycine at pH 7.2 ± 0.2.
