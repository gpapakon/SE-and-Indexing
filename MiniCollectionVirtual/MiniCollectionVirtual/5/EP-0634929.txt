<ABSTRACT>
Medicaments for detecting and treating malignant and non-malignant tissue abnormalities and lesions of the skin; conjunctiva; respiratory, digestive and vaginal mucosa; endometrium and urothelium; and for ablating the endometrial tissue and treating body fluids containing suspended abnormal cells, and for treating cancers of the nervous system are prepared from 5-aminolevulinic acid or precursor thereof and subsequently administered to the patient in an amount sufficient to induce syntheses fluorescence and/or photosensitizing concentrations or protoporphyrin IX in the abnormal cells, followed by exposure of the abnormal cells to light of photoactivating wavelengths.

<DESCRIPTION>
PHOTOCHEMOTHERAPEUTIC METHOD USING 5-AMINOLEVULINIC ACIDAND PRECURSORS THEREOFField of InventionThis invention relates to the manufacture of medicaments for the detection and treatment of certain tissue abnormalities (both cancerous and non-malignant) by induced fluorescence and photochemotherapy respectively. The invention also relates to the manufacture of medicaments for the detection and treatment of abnormalities in body fluids or suspensions containing abnormal cells by induced fluorescence and photochemotherapy. The invention further relates to treatment of both normal and abnormal endometrial tissue by photochemotherapy. Background of InventionTissue abnormalities involving-the skin usually are detected and assessed by a combination of visual inspection and palpation. In certain clinical situations the sensitivity of the visual inspection can be enhanced by the use of non-white light (either ultraviolet or a narrow band in the visible) , or by the prior application of a contrast-enhancing agent such as dilute acetic acidSUBSTITUTESHEET 

or certain stains. Tissue abnormalities that involve surfaces that cannot be palpated (such as the bronchi or the urinary bladder) may be visualized via an appropriate scope. Some specialized scopes can detect induced fluorescence. If the abnormality in guestion is associated with a di ference in either the extent or the pattern of tissue vascularization, such a scope may be used to determine the limits of the area involved by the abnormality, by visualizing an injected bolus of fluorescein as it passes through the vasculature of both the lesion and the adjacent normal tissue.Inaddition, fluorescence-detecting scopes are being used experimentally to identify areas of tissue that show strong porphyrin fluorescence following the intravenous injection of exogenous porphyrins such as hemotophorphyrin IX (HpIX) , hemotoporphyrin derivative (HpD) , or "dihematoporphyrin ether". Such porphyrins tend to accumulate semi-preferentially in malignant tissues, but they also accumulate in tissues that are regenerating following an injury or in the rapidly growing tissues of an embryo or fetus. Normal liver, spleen, and kidney also tend to accumulate these porphyrins. Using such compounds and fluorescence-2 SUBSTITUTE SHEET 

detecting scopes, areas of malignant tissue too small to be identified by standard forms of visual inspection have been identified in the bronchi and in the urinary bladder.Unfortunately, a clinically significant (photosensitizing) amount of porphyrin
