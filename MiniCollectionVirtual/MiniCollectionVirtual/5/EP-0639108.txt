<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and apparatus for producing a feed mixture, advantageously suitable to an anaerobic bioreactor and containing liquid and solid materials, for the further treatment of waste materials. The method of the invention includes at least the following steps: a) into a feed mixture reactor (1), there is first fed liquid so that the free liquid surface (5) is located essentially above the solid material feed point (6) provided in the reactor (1), b) the solid waste material fed into the feed mixture reactor (1) is fed to below the free liquid surface (5) of the reactor (1), and from the solid waste material there is separated (10, 14) both light and heavy rejectable materials by utilizing an agitator (7) installed in the feed mixture reactor (1), and countercurrent washing (14) directed towards the bottom part of the reactor (1). In the apparatus of the invention, the feed points (2, 17) of the liquid and sludgy waste materials to be fed into the feed mixture reactor are arranged on a lower level with respect to the agitator (7), and the feed point (6) of the solid waste material to be fed into the feed mixture reactor is arranged on a higher level than the agitator (7).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for 
producing a feed mixture suitable to an anaerobic bioreactor. While the importance of environmental issues, with respect 
to people's welfare, increases daily, the created waste must 
be treated so that it causes as little damage as possible, 
or that it can be reused. The anaerobic bioreactor is a 
generally known waste treatment unit for solid organic 
waste, such as organic matter sorted out from ordinary 
municipal waste. However, an advantageous operation of the 
anaerobic bioreactor requires that the material treated in 
the reactor undergoes a suitable preliminary treatment prior 
to feeding. The object of the present invention is to eliminate some of 
the drawbacks of the prior art and to create an improved 
method and apparatus for producing a feed mixture which is 
suitable to be fed for instance to an anaerobic bioreactor. 
The essential novel features of the invention are apparent 
from the appended patent claims. According to the invention, solid organic waste undergoes a 
preliminary treatment where the waste is turned into a feed 
mixture for an anaerobic bioreactor, which feed mixture has 
various predetermined qualities. Among these qualities, let 
us point out a suitable solid matter content defined by 
biological operation, technical applicability and economical 
profitability. Another requirement for the feed mixture is 
that the temperature of the mixture is advantageous for the 
functions of bacteria. Moreover, in order to improve flowing 
and mixing properties, heavy inorganic particles surpassing 
a predetermined grain size, for example stone, glass and 
metal, as well as light particles which easily rise to the 
surface of the feed mixture, such as plastic and cork, are  
 
separated from the mixture before feeding it into an anaerobic 
bioreactor. The apparatus of the invention, i.e. the feed mixture reactor 
used for producing the said feed mixture, is advantageously 
for instance a cylindrical tank operated in an 
essentially vertical position, which tank is provided for 
example with essentially conical members, so that inside the 
feed mixture reactor, advantageous conditions are created 
for the material contained therein, for instance with 
respect to the flowing of the material, in order to create 
the desired feed mixture. Inside the feed mixture reactor, 
there is installed an agitating member for preparing an 
advantageously homogeneous feed mixture. The feed mixture 
reactor is also provided with conduits
