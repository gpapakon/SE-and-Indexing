<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a textile decoloriser (decolorant stripper), especially for household purposes, which in aqueous solution forms a decolorising liquor for textiles to be decolorised. It is distinguished according to the invention by a storable powder mixture with thiourea dioxide as the active decolorising component, also with sodium carbonate or some other water-soluble carbonate or bicarbonate of the alkali elements as alkali carrier and with an antifoam for removing oxygen from the decolorising liquor or with a foam preventative for preventing oxygen passing into the decolorising liquor. Preferably the mixture contains about 3 to 20-25% by weight of thiourea dioxide. The decolorising effect can surprisingly, despite the low concentration of thiourea dioxide, be improved by an addition of urea. Such a textile decoloriser is sufficiently stable and also storable, simple to handle and significantly more compatible and also gentler than hitherto customary textile decolorisers based on sodium dithionite. It possesses high decolorising effectiveness and is usable in various temperature ranges, including at room temperature.
