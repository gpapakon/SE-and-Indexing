<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for the
standardization of chromatograms obtained in
chromatography systems. The present invention may be
particularly useful in capillary electrophoresis
systems.Capillary electrophoresis (CE) is an electrophoresis
technique utilizing small bore capillaries. CE
provides methods for the separation of ionic species
including macromolecules. The efficiency of CE can be
relatively high, i.e. in excess of 400,000
theoretical plates, and thus is being explored for a
number of different applications.A typical CE system includes a 50-100 micrometer
internal diameter silica capillary tube filled with a
suitable electrically conducting buffer. The outlet
end of the capillary is immersed in a reservoir
containing the buffer and an electrode. A sample
containing ions of interest is introduced into the
inlet end of the capillary and then the inlet is
placed in another reservoir containing the buffer and
another electrode. Since a small diameter
capillary is used in CE, a relatively high applied 
voltage can be used without the generation of thermal
gradients in the capillary; thus the electrodes are
connected to a power supply capable of delivering ~30
kV per 100 cm of capillary. A detector is placed
between the two electrodes to permit detection of
various ionic species migrating in the capillary. A
detector so positioned is often referred to as an on-column
detector. Typically, an integrator is attached
to the detector, such that the peak areas may be
measured.The movement of the sample ions of interest is
controlled by two factors: the electrophoretic
velocity and the electroosmotic flow velocity. The
total migration velocity is the vector sum of these
two terms.Electrophoretic migration is the migration of the
sample ion towards the oppositely charged electrode
under the influence of the electric field. The
electrophoretic mobility of any particular ion is the
electrophoretic velocity per unit field strength.Electroosmotic flow (EOF) is the bulk flow of the
buffer in the capillary. EOF is due to the charge of
the inside surface of the capillary which is in
contact with buffer containing mobile counterions.
For example, an unmodified silica capillary surface
comprises silanol (Si-OH) groups that are negatively
charged (Si-O-) when the pH of the buffer is greater
than about 2, and positively charged (Si-OH2+) when
the pH is less than about 2. Alternatively,
hydrophobic cations may be adsorbed onto the inside
surface of the capillary to obtain a positively
charged surface
