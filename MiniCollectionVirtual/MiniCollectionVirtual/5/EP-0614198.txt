<ABSTRACT>
The surge arrester contains two connection armatures (1, 2) separated from each other along an axis, at least one cylindrically shaped varistor element (7) being arranged between them. The connection armatures (1, 2) and the one or more varistor element(s) (7) are braced together with the formation of a contact force to form a mechanically stable active part of the surge arrester. The active part is enclosed by a cast housing (12) made of insulating material. The active part is braced by at least two loops (5) acting independently of each other on the connection armatures (1, 2). The loops (5) are arranged with a separation from the one or more varistor element(s) (7). The connection armatures (1, 2) contain bearing surfaces, in each case corresponding to the number of loops (5) and azimuthally distributed regularly about the axis, one loop end being supported in each case on one of these bearing surfaces. In spite of simple design, the surge arrester exhibits good mechanical and electrical properties and can be produced in particularly cost-efficient ways.

Surge arrester having two connection fittings 
(1, 2) spaced apart from one another along an axis, at 

least one cylindrical varistor element (7) arranged 
between the two connection fittings (1, 2), a device, 

made from insulating material, which clamps the 
connection fittings (1, 2) and the at least one 

varistor element (7) in a manner accompanied by the 
formation of contact force, and a cast housing, made 

from insulating material, which at least partially 
surrounds the connection fittings (1, 2), the at least 

one varistor element (7) and the clamping device, 
characterized in that the clamping device has a 

clamping bolt (4) and at least two clamping elements 
which respectively act independently of one another on 

the connection fittings (1, 2) and are respectively 
constructed as loops (5) having two loop ends, in that 

each connection fitting (1, 2) contains bearing areas 
which respectively correspond to the number of the 

loops (5) and are distributed about the axis in a 
uniform fashion in the circumferential direction, in 

that each bearing area of a first (1) of the two 
connection fittings (1, 2) is aligned, in the direction 

of the axis, with a bearing area of a second (2) of the 
two connection fittings (1, 2), and in that the two 

loop ends of a loop are mounted on those bearing areas 
of the two connection fittings (1, 2) which are aligned 

with one another. 
Surge arrester according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the bearing areas respectively 

have a section with a semicircular surface profile. 
Surge arrester according to one of Claims 1 or 
2, characterized in that the bearing areas are arranged 

on projections, constructed as shoulders (13), at least 
on one of the two connection fittings (1, 2). 
Surge arrester according to one of Claims 1 or 
2, characterized in that the bearing areas are arranged  

 
in recesses, constructed as groove (6), at least on one ( 

of the two connection fittings (1, 2). 
Surge arrester according to one of Claims 1 to 
4, characterized in that two bearing areas arranged 

diametrically relative to one another are provided on 
each of the two connection fittings (1, 2). 
Surge arrester according to one of Claims 1 to 
4, characterized in that three bearing areas arranged 

offset azimuthally about the axis by approximately 120Â° 
are provided on each of the two connection fittings (1, 

2). 
Surge arrester according to one of Claims 1 to 
6, characterized in that at least one of the loops (5) 

contains a wound tape. 
Surge arrester according to Claim 7, 
characterized in that the wound tape is embedded in a 

plastic matrix. 
Surge arrester according to Claim 8, 
characterized in that the plastic matrix is formed by 

the curing of curable plastic before the loop (5) has 
been placed on the bearing areas. 
Surge arrester according to Claim 8, 
characterized in that the plastic matrix is formed by 

the curing of curable plastic after the loops (5) have 
been placed on the bearing areas. 
Surge arrester according to one of Claims 1 to 
10, characterized in that at least one current transfer 

element which can be deformed with the formation of the 
contact force is provided in the current path between 

the two connection fittings (1, 2). 
Surge arrester according to Claim 11, 
characterized in that the current transfer element is 

constructed as a disc (10) and has grooves which are 
guided concentrically about the axis and shaped in end 

faces of the disc.
