<ABSTRACT>
It is an object of the present invention to provide 
the parts data recorder and the mounter which can get the 

parts data of the electronic parts automatically by 
processing the picture information which is obtained by 

the camera for recording the electronic parts. 
The chip (C) which are put on the parts stage 1 are 
carried to the mounting stage 3 by the mounter 2, and 

mounted on the printed circuit board 4. The chip (C) are 
recorded by the camera, which is provided between the 

parts stage 1 and the mounting stage 3 in the conveyance 
path. The parts data is extracted from the picture 

information which is recorded by the video camera 7. The 
picture information is stored in the memory. 

Consequently, it is possible to extract the parts data 
without key operation and the like.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a mounting device for mounting 
an electronic component on a printed circuit board 
automatically and, more particularly, to an 
art for mounting packaged IC, LSI and the like, on the 
printed circuit board. An example of a 
mounting device for mounting an electronic component on 
a printed circuit board automatically, comprising : a mount head having a vacuum bit adapted for holding 
the electronic component; and recognizing means for determining whether the electronic 
component is suitable for being mounted on the board and is 
suitably held by the mounting head and for correcting its 
position if necessary before the electronic component is 
mounted on the printed circuit board, is disclosed in 
US-A-5 212 881.  Electronic parts such as an IC comprises: a main 
portion, that is to say, a molded portion, which has 
rectangular shape in plan view; and a plurality of leads, 
each of which is protruding from the outer circumference 
of the molded portion. When mounting such electronic 
parts on the printed circuit board, the electronic 
parts ( e, g, one IC chip ) are carried from a parts supply 
stage, on which a plurality of electronic parts is put to a 
mounting stage on which the printed circuit boards are held 
by using a chip mounter. In general, the chip mounter has a mount head which 
is provided with a vacuum bit which vacuums the 
electronic parts; this mount head is provided with a 
centering apparatus which mechanically positions the  
  
 
electronic parts at the predetermined reference point and 
the predetermined posture. However, the centering apparatus has a positioning 
member which touches the electronic parts. This 
positioning member makes the leads of the electronic 
parts bend. The present inventor examined an art, in which only, 
the vacuuming is done without the centering, the position 
and the posture of the electronic part which is held by 
the chip mounter are detected by using a camera, the 
electronic part is mounted on the printed circuit board, 
and the drift of the mount head with respect to the 
reference position is adjusted when mounting the 
electronic part on the printed circuit board. However, for the computing of the shape and the 
measurement by processing the picture information which 
is extracted by using the video camera, it is necessary 
to prepare the measurement of all of the electronic parts 
which are mounted and to input the data of the measurement 
and the like using a keyboard, or to prepare a library 
thereof. Accordingly,

A mounting device for mounting an electronic component (C) on 
a printed circuit board (4) automatically, comprising : 


a mount head (2a) having a vacuum bit (5) adapted for holding 
the electronic component; and 
a recording means for taking a picture of the electronic 
component held by the vacuum bit by using a video camera (7); 
a data computing means (11) for processing the picture 
obtained by the recording means and for computing the size of each 

part of the electronic component and/or the number of leads 
(Cb) to obtain a parts data, for specifying 

the kind of the electronic component, based on the 
picture of the electronic component obtained by said recording 

means; 
a data storing means (12) for storing the obtained parts data 
of the electronic component; 
a positional error calculating means (13) for calculating an 
error of X-Y direction between a stored reference center position 

of said vacuum bit in accordance with the parts data and the present center position of the 
electronic component obtained by the parts data, and for 

calculating an error of rotational direction between the 
correct position of the elec
tronic component and the present 
position of the electronic component obtained by the parts 

data, at the state that the electronic component is held by 
the vacuum bit;  

 
an adjustment value computing means for computing an 
adjustment value to correct the positional error of the mount 

head when the electronic component is mounted on the print 
circuit board in accordance with said errors of X-Y direction 

and rotational direction; 
so that said mount head can be operated in accordance with 
said adjustment value for mounting the electronic component 

on the printed circuit board correctly.
