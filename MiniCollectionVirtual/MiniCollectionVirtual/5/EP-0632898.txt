<ABSTRACT>
An inductive sensor (11) with an electric coil (14) cooperates with a rotating, magnetoconductive part to emit electric signals. The ends of the windings of the coil (14) are wound on an end (21) of a busbar (15). In order to secure the bent end (21) of the busbar, a securing bracket (31) is punched out of the busbar (15) and pressed on the bent end (21). The end (21) of the busbar is thus reliably secured, so that it cannot become loose in particular because of temperature variations. The durability of the sensor (11) is thus improved.

<CLAIMS>
Busbar (15), in particular for an inductive 
sensor (11), for connecting the ends of the windings of 

a coil (14) and an electric feed line (19), the busbar 
(15) having a bent-over end section (21) to which the end 

or the start of the winding of the coil (14) is attached, 
characterized in that the busbar (15) has a clip (31) 

made of the same material, which is positioned on the 
bent-over end section (21). 
Busbar according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the clip (31) is cut out of the busbar (15).
