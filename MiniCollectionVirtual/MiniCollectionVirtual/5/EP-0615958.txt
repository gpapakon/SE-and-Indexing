<ABSTRACT>
A punch assembly (1) for a machine for shaping glass 
articles, in which at least one casing (7), adapted to 

support a punch (11) for movement relative to the casing 
(7), is connected to its own fixed support (2) by a 

rapid-connection device (12) which has two jaws (13) 
carried by one component selected from the fixed support 

(2) and the casing (7), and a pair of counter elements 
(24) each associated with a respective jaw (13) and 

carried by the other of the fixed support (2) and the 
casing (7); the counter elements (24) being movable under 

the action of a drive unit (28) between an operative 
position in which they cooperate with the jaws (13) to 

attach the casing (7) to the fixed support (2) and a rest 
position in which the counter elements (24) are 

disengaged from the jaws (13) allowing the casing (7) to 
be moved away from the fixed support (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a punch 
or also known as plunger 
assembly for a 
machine for shaping or forming articles of glass. Forming machines are usually used in the glass industry 
and are adapted to receive gobs of molten glass in 
succession from a known advancing and cutting assembly 
and to advance these gobs through a plurality of shaping 
stations at each of which each gob is shaped 
progressively to form a specific semi-finished product. In most applications 
(see e.g. US-A-2 702 444), 
a forming machine includes a punch 
assembly for forming, in succession, a plurality of 
rough-shaped products each of which has a cavity, and one 
or more finishing units located downstream of the punch 
assembly. The punch assembly is located immediately 
downstream of the advancing and cutting assembly and in 
turn includes a rough-shaping mould defining at least one 
cavity for receiving a gob of molten glass and a punch 
which is associated with the said cavity and is coupled 
to its own support casing or structure for movement 
relative to the support structure itself under the action 
of a respective actuator device towards and away from the 
cavity between a withdrawn, rest position and an 
advanced, operative position in which the punch itself 
extends into the cavity and through the respective gob of 
molten glass to form the said rough-shaped product.  
 Obviously, after a variable number of rough-shaped 
products have been produced, the punch reaches the limit 
of its usefulness and must, therefore, be replaced. It 
is known that the punch must be replaced in a relatively 
short period of time so as not to disturb the production 
rhythm substantially but above all, to avoid the 
condition of the mass of molten glass which may be 
present in the supply and cutting assembly from changing 
as regards its temperature and, hence, density and 
creating problems in the renewal of the cycle after the 
replacement of the punch itself. For this purpose, the punch assembly normally includes 
its own fixed frame and a device for connecting the 
support casing or structure to the fixed frame. The 
connecting devices known until now include one or more 
rods each of which has an intermediate portion for 
bearing against a shoulder carried by the support 
structure and a threaded end portion which engages a 
threaded hole in the fixed frame. Such connecting 
devices, although being simple from a constructional 
point of view, have the major disadvantage of becoming 
unreliable after a relatively small
