<ABSTRACT>
In an electric circuit supplying AC line current 
to a load (30, 31) from an AC source (26) of given 

frequency providing repetitive cycles, arc detection is 
provided by sensing cycle to cycle changes in the AC line 

current. The AC line current is sampled with a harmonic 
notch filter (72) at a plurality of n phases Θ₁ through 

Θ
n
 during each of a plurality of m cycles of the AC 
source (26), to provide a plurality of currents I
n,m
, 
where n is the phase and m is the cycle. The differences 

(I
n,m
)-(I
n,m-x
), where x is a designated number of cycles, 
provide a plurality of current difference signals. The 

absolute values of these current difference signals ID 
are accumulated in a synchronous summer (94) over the m 

cycles. An arc indicative signal is generated in response 
to given conditions and given combinations of 

conditions (116) of the cumulative absolute current 
difference signals ID. Cycle to cycle changes in AC line 

voltage are also sensed with a harmonic notch filter 
(146), and the arc indicative signal is disarmed in 

response to a given voltage condition. In further embodiments, 
subcycle changes are sensed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to protection techniques
for electric circuits, and more particularly to the
detection of arcs which are too small to trip a circuit
breaker or the like.The invention arose during development efforts
in electric circuit protection techniques, including
residential, commercial and industrial applications
having overcurrent protection and/or ground fault interrupter
(GFI) systems for preventing property damage
and/or personal injury. Overcurrent protection systems
typically include a load center or panelboard receiving
electrical power from the utility company transformer,
and routing the electrical power through a main circuit
breaker or fuse and then through branch circuit breakers
or fuses to designated branch circuits, each supplying
current to one or more electrical loads. The circuit
breakers or fuses are designed to interrupt the electrical
current if it is excessive or outside the design
limits of the conductors and loads or demonstrates a
current imbalance, to reduce the risk of injury and damage,
including fires. Circuit breakers are more commonly
preferred because they are reusable simply by resetting
same.A circuit breaker has a thermal/magnetic trip
characteristic. The thermal characteristic is operative
in response to overload current of extended duration
which heats a bimetal member, causing movement of the
latter, which in turn releases a latch to trip open a set
of contacts. For example, the thermal characteristic
would respond to 30 amps being drawn in a 15 amp circuit.
The magnetic characteristic is operative in response to a
sudden high magnitude current overload condition, and
uses the magnetic field generated in a magnetic core to
attract an armature, which movement releases the latch to
open the contacts. As an example, the magnetic type 
actuation occurs in response to a short circuit wherein
the hot line conductor becomes directly connected with
ground or neutral, bypassing the load.A further type of circuit protection is provided
by a ground fault interrupter, which trips the breaker
to an open circuit condition in response to an imbalance
of currents between the line and neutral conductors of a
given circuit. This is particularly desirable in the
event that a person is in the path to ground.The present invention addresses a further type
of electric circuit protection and monitoring, namely the
detection of arcing in the electric circuit. The arcs to
be monitored include not only a discharge of electricity
through a gas or across an insulating medium, but
