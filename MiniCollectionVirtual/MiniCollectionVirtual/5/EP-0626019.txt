<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method of producing a film of metal (2M) which covers the whole or parts of a substrate (1) made of an organic or inorganic material. The metal film (2M) is produced from a chemical compound containing a metal. The compound is first evaporated, then condensed on to the surface of the substrate (1) and decomposed by irradiation with UV radiation to give a metal film (2M). In order to ensure high homogeneity within the metal film (2M) and to form a sharp edge, the substrate (1) is cooled to a cryogenic temperature during the condensation and irradiation of the chemical compound.
