<ABSTRACT>
An organism which does not express its natural nisA gene product, but is capable of expressing genes for nisin modification, immunity and translocation out of the cell is produced. The organism may be transformed with a coding sequence for a variant prenisin and, if necessary, appropriate regulatory sequences for expression thereof such that the organism is capable of secreting the corresponding variant nisin. A process for exclusively producing a variant nisin therefore comprises fermenting this organism and obtaining the nisin so produced.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the production of protein-engineered nisins.Nisin is a highly modified peptide antibiotic produced, for example, by
certain strains of Lactococcus lactis. It is of great interest to the food
industry because of its efficient antimicrobial activity against a wide range
of gram-positive organisms including many spoilage bacteria and food
pathogens, for example, Listeria, Clostridia and Bacillus species (12,25).The chemical structure of nisin is well established (6,17,34,45, Fig 9).
It is a member of the family of antibiotics termed lantibiotics. These
unusual polycyclic peptides share the structural features of dehydro-residues
and intrachain sulphide bridges forming lanthionine and Î²-methyllanthionine
rings. The atypical residues are introduced by post-translational
modification of amino acids serine, threonine and cysteine in
the primary sequence of a precursor peptide (lantibiotics are the subject
of a recent extensive review, 26). Biosynthesis of nisin thus involves
genes for both the inactive precursor of nisin, known as prenisin, (nisA)
and also the modifying enzymes responsible for nisin maturation. The
mature nisin molecule is based on a sequence of 34 amino acids. The
protein encoded by nisA includes a 23 amino acid N terminal signal
sequence which is cleaved off during secretion of nisin. The conversion
of prenisin, encoded by nisA, into mature nisin involves cleavage of the
leader and the modification of individual amino acids. The nisA gene has
been cloned and characterised (1,27,11) and shown to have a
chromosomal location (11,42). A number of additional, as yet
uncharacterised, genes involved in the enzymatic modification of prenisin,
translocation and immunity are encoded by nisin producing strains (42).
These determinants, along with nisA, are thought to be clustered together 
as has been described recently for the lantibiotics subtilin (28) and
epidermin (41). It has been known for some time that nisin determinants
can be transferred by conjugation (14) and it has now been established that
this ability is due to their carriage on a large conjugative transposon,
Tn5301 (22,38).Established protein engineering techniques can be used to introduce
changes to the amino acid sequence of nisin. This involves modifying the
coding region of the nisin structural gene, nisA, for example by site-directed
or random mutagenesis. Expression of these changes is
complicated by the fact that nisin is post-translationally modified.Variant nisins may be constructed by the expression
