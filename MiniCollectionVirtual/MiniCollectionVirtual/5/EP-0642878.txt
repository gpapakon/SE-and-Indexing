<ABSTRACT>
In a welding station (1), particularly for motor-vehicle 
bodies, the elements to be welded are locked in 

a precise position by locking devices carried by 
locating gates (17, 18). There are provided a number of 

pairs of locating gates (17, 18), corresponding to the 
number of different types of structures to be welded on 

which the station must operate. The gates (17, 18) are 
mounted on powered carriages (20) which are guided 

longitudinally on both sides of the conveyor line (2) 
to allow the pair of gates which are in the operative 

position to be rapidly interchanged. The elements of 
the structure to be welded reach the work area 

suspended to a hook (6), without being preliminarly 
connected to each other.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to devices for spot 
welding of structures formed of pressed sheet metal 
elements, particularly motor-vehicle bodies, of the 
type comprising: 
a welding station provided with programmable 
automatic welding means, a line for feeding the structures to be welded in 
sequence to the welding station, at least two pairs of locating gates provided at 
the welding station so as to be rapidly interchangeable 
at a work area, said locating gates carrying devices 
for clamping the elements forming the structure to be 
welded in the proper assembling position relative to 
each other, the gates of each pair being provided with 
clamping devices adapted to a respective type of 
structure to be welded, said pairs of gates being slidably mounted 
longitudinally of said welding station on both sides 
thereof, so as to be rapidly displaceable between a 
waiting area and said work area, the gates of each pair 
being also displaceable transversely of said line, when 
they are in the work area, between spaced apart 
inoperative positions and relatively close positions,  
 
in which the clamping devices are able to engage the 
structure which is at the work area. The applicant has been producing for a long time 
welding devices having the above indicated features 
(see for example US-A-4 256 947 and DE-A-2 810 822). 
Such welding systems, marketed under the trade mark 
"ROBOGATE", have determined a turnaround in the 
technique of spot welding of motor-vehicle bodies. The 
Robogate system has been applied extensively by many 
car manufacturers around the world, due to a number of 
relevant advantages with respect to the previously used 
systems. Firstly, this system has a high degree of 
flexibility, i.e. it is able to operate on bodies even 
very different from each other, so that a same line can 
be used for producing different models. Secondly, the 
system may be adapted with relatively simple and quick 
operations, and hence with very low investments, to the 
production of a new body model. Another advantage lies 
in that a uniform quality is ensured on all the models 
of a same type on which the system operates. The prior art according to the Robogate system 
contemplates that each body to be welded arrives at the 
welding station in a loosely preassembled condition. 
Indeed, upstream of the Robogate welding station, one 
or more "toy-tabbing" stations are provided, in which 
the various elements forming the body are loosely  
 
assembled together by bending coupling tabs. Such 
provisiona

Device for spot welding of structures formed of 
pressed sheet metal elements, particularly motor-vehicle 

bodies, comprising: 

a welding station (1) provided with programmable 
automatic welding means (16), 
a line (2) for feeding the structures to be welded in 
sequence to the welding station (1), 
at least two pairs of locating gates (17, 18) provided 
at the welding station (1) so as to be rapidly 

interchangeable at a work area, said gates carrying 
devices for locking the elements forming the structure 

to be welded in the proper assembling position relative 
to each other, the gates of each pair being provided 

with locking devices adapted to a respective type of 
structure to be welded, 
said pairs of gates (17, 18) being slidably mounted 
longitudinally on both sides of said line (2) at the 

welding station (1), so that they are rapidly movable 
between a waiting area (W1, W2) and said work area (L), 

said gates (17, 18) of each pair being also movable 
transversely of said line (2), when they are at the 

work area (L), between spaced apart inoperative 
positions and relatively close operative positions, in 

which the locking devices carried by said gates engage 
the structure which is at the work area L,  

 
said locating gates (17, 18) being mounted on 
powered carriages (20) which are guided along two 

tracks (22) on both sides of said line (2), characterised in that: 
said line (2) comprises support means (6) for 
supporting the various elements forming each structure 

to be welded in a position close to the final 
assembling position, but with said elements being 

separate from each other, 
said guiding tracks (22) have separate portions 
(23) which are movable transversely of the longitudinal 

direction of said line (2) at the work area (L), for 
displacing the two locating gates (17, 18) which are at 

the work area (L) between their spaced apart 
inoperative positions and their relatively close

other, and a second position, in which said side 

portions (8) are spaced apart from each other and are 
adjacent to two locating gates provided in their spaced 

apart inoperative positions, so as to allow said side 
portions (8) to be picked up by said locking devices of  

 
said locating gates (17, 18) and then to allow the
