<ABSTRACT>
The improvements are applicable to the production of cast steel parts 
(15), provided with inner cavities (16), by the arrangement of various 

stacked compartments (1,2,3,4,5,6), with a central filling collector (8) 
and multiple parts (7) disposed radially or in another form in each of 

the compartments and characterised in that in the end of the core 
(21,30) which corresponds to the inner cavity of each of the parts, 

there is a projection (20,22,23,24,26,27,28) for controlling a recess 
which is provided inside the part, in the area distant from the outer 

surface thereof, all of the filling being performed from the single 
central filling duct (8), without supply sinkheads. The projection for 

controlling the recess disposed inside the core provides communication 
of the cavity of the recess with the atmosphere, by means of its own 

core, owing to the permeability of the sand, avoiding local depressions 
in the walls of the cast part.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to improvements
introduced in the production of cast steel parts provided
with inner cavities, particularly concerning a mould
assembly therefor, which permit substantial advantages
to be obtained relative to the present state of the art.The steel parts to be produced according to the
present invention are preferably wear-resistant cast
steel parts, in particular the teeth of excavators and
other earth-moving machines, in which the part has a
generally pointed structure with an inner cavity, which is
open at one end of the part, thus permitting it to be connected
to an acceptance or male part of the machine,
and therefore enabling it to be replaced when it is worn.US Patent 2.101.046 to Blettner discloses
some improvements in the casting of a plurality of pistons
for combustion engines, however, no reference is
made to the problems of internal recesses in steel castings,
or to measures for controlling the location of said
recesses.Owing to the complex structure of the part,
conventional casting methods require the use of sinkheads
with sufficient additional volume to permit localisation
of the recess which is formed at the end of the
period of solidification of the part, thus enabling sound
parts to be obtained. In the methods currently known,
the dimensions of the assembly of each casting box,
with its core or compartment, and the corresponding
sinkheads, thus need to be considerable in order for
these parts to be produced.Owing to the need to reduce the price of the
parts, at the same time as obtaining a high quality
thereof, it has become necessary in the industry to
improve the production method of these parts, by
obtaining optimum use of the steel employed in the
casting, thus providing a high coefficient of use of the
said cast steel mass, and simultaneously permitting a
larger number of parts to be cast for a specific volume of
boxes stacked, in order to obtain increased productivity.These have been the objectives of the applicants
in developing their invention, which can be summarised
as:
improvement of the system of filling and supply of
the parts, thus obtaining improved output measured
in terms of the ratio between cast steel and net
steel;reduction of the need for molten steel, since, as the
quantity of fluid steel for a specific production is
reduced, the capacity of the casting means can be
smaller, and optionally some of the furnaces currently
used in the casting installations can be eliminated;increase of the quantity of parts per mould;improvement of the

<CLAIMS>
Mould assembly for the production of cast steel parts, provided with inner
cavities, in which the moulds are radially arranged in a stack about a

common filling conduit, each mould comprising a core for the production of
parts with a hollow end, the core communicating with the atmosphere at the

outer end,
characterized in that

at the end of the core corresponding to the inner cavity of each of the parts to
be moulded a projection is arranged of a material which can generate heat

and gases at the moment of casting for controlling the recess after casting to
be located in an area distant from the outer surfaces of the casting, and

the moulds being arranged to be entirely filled from the common filling
conduit, without supply sinkheads.
Mould assembly according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the projection
of the core is of the detachable type.
