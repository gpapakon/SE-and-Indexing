<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a subscriber loop carrier system 
wherein, to synchronize the phases of frames and 

multiframes from a plurality of subscriber loop carriers, 
corrections are made on the phases of frames and 

multiframes without relying on memory storage. The phase 
difference of the frame and multiframe phases with 

respect to a reference phase is detected at the receiving 
end. The detected phase difference is transmitted from 

the receiving end to the transmitting end. At the 
transmitting end, the phases of frames and multiframes 

being formed are controlled on the basis of the detected 
phase difference.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and
apparatus for correcting the phase of transmitted data
frames, and more particularly to a method and apparatus
for correcting the phase of frames/multiframes
transmitted over incoming lines in subscriber loop
carrier systems.Subscriber loop carrier systems have been
employed to accommodate subscribers, at geographically
remote locations from switching offices, economically and
with high transmission quality, and also to alleviate the
problem of the ever increasing number of telephone cables
in urban areas. In conventional subscriber loop carrier
systems, a plurality of subscriber lines are multiplexed
as PCM data with a frame/multiframe structure at a remote
terminal (RT), and the thus multiplexed PCM data are then
transmitted over a fiber optic or other transmission
medium to a central office terminal (COT), where the data
are demultiplexed into a plurality of subscriber lines
for connection to switching equipment. Furthermore, in
recent years, high-order multiplexing has come to be
adopted wherein a plurality of multiplexed data, instead
of undergoing demultiplexing at a COT, are further
multiplexed into a high-level multiplexed signal, for
direct connection to a switching network such as SONET.
To achieve this, a multiplexer for remultiplexing a
plurality of multiplexed data is provided with a time
slot interchanger (TSI) for interchanging time slots to
accomplish dynamic rearrangement on a user-by-user basis.
The TSI is provided to accommodate a larger number of
subscriber lines than the number of channels in a 
multiplexed transmission path. To facilitate the
interchanging of time slots in the TSI, the phases of the
frames/multiframes of the PCM data transmitted over
different transmission paths from different RTs must be
corrected to achieve synchronization. In the prior art,
this phase correction is done by storing the data in
memory at the receiving end. This requires the provision
of a memory for storing the data, and furthermore,
transmission delays are caused because of temporarily
storing the data.If the differences between transmission delay
times from the different RTs are within one-frame period,
the phase correction is only necessary for the frame, but
no phase correction is needed for the multiframe. In
this case, a memory that can store one frame of data will
suffice for the purpose, and the transmission delay can
be kept within one frame period. On the other hand, if
the differences between transmission delay times from the
different RTs
