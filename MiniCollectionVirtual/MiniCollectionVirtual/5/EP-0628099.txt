<DESCRIPTION>
WATER-SAVING DEVICE FOR WASHING-DRYING MACHINESThe present invention relates to a water-saving device for washing-drying machines.Machines termed washing-drying machines with closed-cycle air circulation are known which comprise an air circulation device which starts to operate at the end of the washing cycle and after spi -drying, for drying the laundry completely.Various air circulation devices are known. In a first type, the air enters the tank, where the laundry is heated by a radiating element, removes the moisture, passes through the holes of the drum along the discharge ducts, and then rises up to the fan, which pushes the air back into the tank. The air, by passing through the warm laundry, removes the moisture and, by passing through the discharge duct, makes contact with the cooling water and consequently deposits the moisture. This cycle is repeated for approximately 100-120 minutes until the laundry is perfectly dry.In a second type of known device, the air is pushed by a fan in contact with a resistor which heats it. The air is then fed into the drum, where, in contact with the wet laundry, it becomes loaded with moisture. This moisture-rich air then passes in a condenser, which is kept humid and cold by a jet of water, and deposits the moisture inside said condenser.Other systems, which are substantially similar to those 

described above, provide for the feeding of air and heat into the laundry, which yields its moisture to the air. The air is fed into a condenser (which is kept cold by water) , where said air releases its moisture. By repeating the cycle for a certain time, the laundry is dried.An essential component of these drying systems is the condenser, where the air, in contact with the cold water, releases its moisture.The condenser is generally constituted by a substantially vertical duct, wherein the current of warm and moist air coming from the lower end is intercepted by a film of water co ing from the upper end. The film of water cools the warm air causing the condensation of the moisture.The water also captures' and removes the fluff, which has deposited on the duct walls. This fluff is then disposed of together with the discharge water.The water thus acts as cooling means and as means for washing the condensation ducts in known drying systems.Since in conventional machines the drying cycle is rather long, from at least 70 minutes up to 120 minutes, there is a considerable consumption of water, generally from 40 to 70 liters for each drying cycle.The aim of the present
