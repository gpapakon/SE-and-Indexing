<ABSTRACT>
A microbial barrier isolation system for enclosing and decontaminating equipment to that the equipment may be used in handling or otherwise contacting biologically-sensitive materials such as parenteral solutions and solids. The barrier system (10) is formed with an inner cavity (14), an upper chamber (12) separated from the inner cavity by filters (16), an air return conduit (30), means (44) for supplying dry, heated air to heat the system and means (34) for using steam to decontaminate the internal parts of the system. The decontamination process involves using dry air to heat the internal equipment of the system to reduce water condensation and then introducing saturated steam at a positive pressure slightly above atmospheric pressure, about 1/4" W.C. The internal equipment, including all surfaces, is exposed to the steam for a sufficient time to decontaminate the equipment and the system is then cooled down with cool, sterile air.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to material
treatment ovens and, more particularly, relates to a means
for decontaminating equipment used in the pharmaceutical
industry.An increasing number of materials sold on the market
today are sensitive to contamination by viable
microorganisms. Drugs that are injected into living tissue
or blood (parenteral solutions) are particularly sensitive
to contamination by such microorganisms. The current
standard set by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
regarding the probability of having a viable microorganism
present in an aseptically-assembled product is generally on
the order of one in one thousand (10-3). The FDA would like
to increase this standard to one in one million (10-6).
Consequently, the FDA is encouraging change in parenteral
drug manufacturing that will decrease the probability of
contamination.There are several paths available to decreasing the
probability of viable microorganisms in a parenteral drug
product. One of these paths which is encouraged by the FDA
is the use of terminal sterilization where possible for
parenteral-type pharmaceutical products. Many such
products, however, are temperature sensitive, i.e., a 
temperature that is significantly greater than ambient
temperatures will rapidly degrade their efficacy or
activity. For products that cannot be terminally
sterilized, improved aseptic manufacturing systems are the
only alternative.One method of controlling the contamination of
parenteral drug products involves sterilizing the products
prior to filling. The products are then aseptically filled
and the containers closed within a decontaminated box that
is absent of any workers. Such a system has the potential
of meeting the reduced microbial contamination levels
sought by the FDA. This type of system is called a barrier
system since there is a barrier between the product and the
equipment operator.US-A-4.992.247 discloses a sterilisation system having an inner chamber, an upper
manifold and a sterilisation conduit.US-A-4.846.669 discloses a sterilisation oven having filter means between an upper
chamber and an inner cavity.For a barrier system to help meet the new FDA
objectives, it must have isolation integrity and be able to
maintain this isolation integrity during operation. The
decontamination of barrier systems is a critical part of
the process. A variety of techniques are known in the art
for effectively decontaminating filling lines and the like
which are used in connection with pharmaceutical products.
