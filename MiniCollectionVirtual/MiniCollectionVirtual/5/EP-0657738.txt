<ABSTRACT>
A seal (6) for a bearing having a rotating 
outer race (12) and fixed inner race (14), closes the 

annular space between the two races (12, 14) and further 
excites a sensor (10) which delivers a signal that 

reflects the angular velocity of the outer race (12). 
The seal (6) has outer and inner cases (36, 56) and 

elastomeric sealing elements (70, 88) bonded to the 
cases (36, 56). The outer case (36) fits into a bore 

(22) that opens out of the outer race (12) and its seal 
element (70) contacts the inner case (56) along the 

inner race (14). The inner case (56) fits over the inner 
race (14) and its seal element (88) is directed 

outwardly toward the outer case (36) and the outer race 
(12). In addition, the seal (6) has an encoder ring (46) 

which is secured to the outer case (36) and presents a 
radial wall containing disruptions (54) which excite the 

sensor (10) when the disruptions move past the sensor 
(10) as the encoder ring (46) rotates with the outer 

race (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to bearing seals and
more particularly to seals which have the capacity to activate
speed sensors.Antilock brake systems, which are found on many
automobiles and trucks of current manufacture, require devices
at the road wheels for sensing the angular velocities of those
wheels. On any vehicle so equipped, the speed sensing devices
generate signals which are monitored by a processor that in
turn controls the braking forces applied to the wheels, the
object being to keep all four wheels rotating at the same
velocity, even though one of the wheels may be rolling over a
surface that offers considerably less frictional resistance
than the surface over which the other wheels are rolling.The typical speed sensing device includes an encoder
ring which rotates with the road wheel that is to be monitored
and a sensor which is excited by the encoder ring in the sense
that it produces a pulsating electrical signal which reflects
the angular velocity of the ring. To this end, the ring, which
is formed from a ferrous metal, has discontinuities in the form
of teeth or apertures that disrupt a magnetic flux upon
rotation of the ring. The sensor responds to the periodic 
disruptions and delivers a signal, the frequency of which
is proportional to the angular velocity of the ring and
road wheel.Typically, the nondriven wheels of an automotive
vehicle are attached to hubs which rotate about spindles
that are fixed in the sense that they do not rotate, there
being wheel bearings between the spindles and hubs. If the
vehicle is equipped with an antilock braking system, the
encoder rings for these wheels are normally fitted over the
hubs. But space is limited in the region of the bearings
and hubs, and the encoder rings and the sensors represent
unnecessary protuberances in these confined spaces.In US-A-5,085,519 a double row tapered roller
bearing is disclosed having an encoder ring secured to one
of the bearing races and a speed sensor secured to the
other bearing race. Seals are provided between the races.In EP-A-0 532 011, on which the two part form of
the independent claims 1 and 10 is based, there is
disclosed a pack seal having an encoder ring for activating
a speed sensor. The encoder ring is held in position on the
pack seal by a flexible sealing element providing a fluid
barrier between two substantially L-shaped seal members.In accordance with an aspect of the invention there
is provided a bearing that comprises an
outer race which rotates about an axis and has a raceway
that is
