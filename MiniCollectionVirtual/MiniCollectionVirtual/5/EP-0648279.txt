<ABSTRACT>
A biologically active oligosaccharide compound comprising at least two L hexose rings connected together by an ether oxygen atom. The ether oxygen atom is connected to a first of the rings at the first carbon atom to the right of the hexose ring oxygen atom. The compound contains at least one sulfate or phosphate group connected to the first ring at the third carbon atom to the right of the ring oxygen or to a methyl group at the fifth carbon atom to the right of the ring oxygen atom. The invention further includes the method for using the above oligosaccharide compound to detect (alpha) 1,3-L-fucosyltransferases or to block the activity of such (alpha) 1,3-L-fucosyltransferases or structures which mimic the structure of such fucosyltransferases to the extent that such structures bind to compounds of the present invention, e.g., as in the case of HIV virus.

<DESCRIPTION>
Portions of this invention were made with grants from the
National Cancer Institute CA35329 and the National Science
Foundation, DMB87-15954. The United States Government may have
certain rights in this invention.α 1, 3-L-fucosyltransferases have been found to be elevated
in sera of many individuals diagnosed with solid tumors such as
those of ovarian cancer, stomach cancer, lung cancer, liver
cancer, colon cancer, pancreatic cancer, lingua cancer, and
cancer of the larynx and many others. Reference may be had to
"Elevated Activities of Serum α (1 -> 3)-L-Fucosyltransferase in
Human Cancer", Yazawa et al., Journal of Tumor Marker Oncology,
Vol. 4, No. 4, pp. 355-361 (1989); "Fucosyltransferases:
Differential Plasma and Tissue Alterations in Hepatocellular
Carcinoma and Cirrhosis", Hutchinson et al., Hepatology, Vol. 13,
No. 4, 683-688 (1991);
"Changes in Fucose
Metabolism Associated with Heavy Drinking and Smoking: A
Preliminary Report", Thompson et al., Clinica Chimica Acta, 201:
59-64 (1991); and "Tumor-related Elevation of Serum (α1->3)-L-Fucosyltransferase
Activity in Gastric Cancer", Yazawa et al., J.
Canc. Res. Clin. Oncol., 115:451-455 (1989); all of which are
incorporated herein by reference. This enzyme thus appears
useful as a diagnostic marker for cancer.The expression of mono, di and trimeric x-determinants in
glycolipids of colon carcinoma was shown to be due to the
retrogenetic expression of type 2 chain precursors (Galβ1, 4 Glc
NAcβ) that were not found in normal adult colonic epithelial
cells. This implies that the type of the precursor restricted
the fucosyltransferase involved to transfer fucose to the C-3
position of G1cNAc. Further, human colonic adenocarcinoma Colo
205 cells, in contrast to human small cell lung carcinoma NCI-H69
cells and lung carcinoma PC 9 cells (of, Holmes et al., J. Biol. Chem.
260, 7619-7627 (1986); and Holmes et al., J. Biol. Chem. 261, 3737-3743
(1986)), transferred fucose in
α1,4 linkage to lacto-series type 1 chain structures (Gal β1, 3
Glc NAcβ) and in α1, 3 linkage to type 2 chain structures. A 
report on the separation of α1,3 and α1,4 fucosyltransferase
activities of human milk on Sephacryl® S-200 column indicated that
neither enzyme fraction was absolutely specific for type 1 or 2
chain acceptors. It becomes thus evident that the expression of
α1,3 and α1,4 fucosylated lacto-series carbohydrate chains
involves fucosyltransferases exhibiting varying degrees of
substrate specificity and differing cell and tissue distribution.
