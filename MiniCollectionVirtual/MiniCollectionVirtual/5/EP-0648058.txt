<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a digital image processing system. According to the invention, a parallel processing architecture is provided, produced on the basis of TRANSPUTERS. The system comprises a first TRANSPUTER (1), or acquisition module, communicating via a bidirectional communications link (10-11) with a corresponding link (20-21) of a second TRANSPUTER (2), or processing module. Specialised circuits for calculation of forward and inverse Discrete Cosine Transforms (3) are arranged on this link. The logic (34) specific to these circuits (3) is particularly capable of decoding control words generated by the processing module (2) and switching the circuits (3) according to three modes: a transparent mode and two active modes for calculating the forward and inverse Discrete Cosine Transforms. The processing module (2) may comprise several TRANSPUTERS organised in a variable-configuration network. Application particularly to coding for low-data rate transmission and to auto-focusing of a video camera.
