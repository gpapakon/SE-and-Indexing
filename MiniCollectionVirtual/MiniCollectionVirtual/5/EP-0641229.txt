<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to specialized equipment
for medical use. The present invention particularly
relates to tracheal tubes which are used to introduce
gasses or vapors along the trachea, such as by an
anesthesiologist during the administration of anesthesia to
a patient undergoing surgery.As early as 1889, a straight tracheal tube was
reported as being used to administer anesthesia. From that
time, tracheal tubes have been designed of various shapes
and curvatures and have been made of either rigid or
flexible materials. Flexible tubes have the advantage of
automatically conforming to the shape and curvature of the
body in individual instances, but have the disadvantage of
dangerous kinking which may cause critical stoppage of gas
or vapor flow through the tube.Known tracheal tubes include the so-called "Oxford
tube", which has a widely curved, right-angle bend adapted
for placement in the trachea and posterior pharynx, and is
formed of non-kinking, flexible tubing. A similarly
constructed tube having a sigmoid curve is shown in U.S.
patent 3,363,629, to Kuhn. Neither of these tubes are
entirely satisfactory.When surgery is to be performed on the head, face,
mouth or neck areas of a patient, it is desirable to
provide a maximum amount of access to those areas.
Therefore, placement of the anesthesia circuit becomes very
important.The anesthesia circuit is normally comprised of a
tracheal tube, an anesthesia supply and means for 
connecting the tracheal tube to the anesthesia supply.
Several different arrangements of the anesthesia circuit
have been used in an attempt to maximize access to the
surgical area.Tracheal tubes may be designed so as to be either
inserted through the oral or nasal passages of a patient.
The choice of using an oral or nasal tracheal tube is
generally dependent on the type of medical or surgical
procedure to be performed.Oral tracheal tubes are introduced through the
patient's mouth and directed into the patient's trachea.
Oral tracheal tubes are generally preferred over nasal
tracheal tubes because it is felt thay are easier to place
correctly in the trachea.A nasal tracheal tube is a tube which is introduced
through the patient's nose and directed into the patient's
trachea. Nasal tracheal tubes are used when the surgeon
performs surgery in the mouth, when the mouth must be
closed during surgery, or when the patient must continue to
be mechanically ventilated for long periods after the
surgical procedure.One known type of tracheal tube is designed to have a
proximal
