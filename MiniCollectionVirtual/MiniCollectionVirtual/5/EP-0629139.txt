<ABSTRACT>
Sheet wave generators have recently been hailed as the new generation of simulated wave generating water rides. The present invention relates to a sheet wave generator with a riding surface appended to a single container of water (21), i.e., a swimming pool, wave pool, or any existing or new water facility. Because the riding surface (20) of the present invention is contained along its outer periphery, the water ride can be compact so that it is suitable for placement in a relatively small area of land. The ride surface itself has an inclined surface (20), a transition turn area, and a downward declining surface which feeds back into the pool. This butterfly configuration (32) is relatively compact, and can be situated such that the flow of water comes from and returns to the pool area. In one embodiment, the invention also has a unique nozzle outlet (30) area which is at or slightly below the elevation of the water surface in the pool, so that riders may skim over the nozzle area and onto the riding surface directly from the pool area. In another embodiment, the invention shows the nozzle outlet area to be elevated in a safe and compact manner thus enabling adaptation to differing site conditions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a water ride for water 
parks, amusement parks, and the like. In particular the invention relates to a sheet flow water ride in a single pool 
comprising an appended inclined container rising above said pool, wherein various effects 
can be created by injecting a power flow of water onto the appended inclined container, 
whereby the flow of water circles around on the plane of the incline, and returns back to 
said pool. Sheet flow water rides have recently been hailed as the new generation of simulated 
wave generating water rides. Initially, the sheet flow generator was designed to simulate 
existing natural waves and phenomenons, such as a tunnel wave, which is highly prized by 
surfers. Generally, sheet wave generators inject water onto an inclined surface upon which 
surfing maneuvers could be performed. The inclined surface is containerless so that the 
supercritical flow of water will not be slowed down along the side of the incline. The water 
flowing from the inclined surface is collected in supplementary pools or moats and then 
recirculated back through a channel to an elevated container from which the water is 
extruded back onto the incline. One disadvantage of previous sheet wave generator systems is that they required a 
substantially large area of land which can be scarce and costly to provide. Moreover, 
previous sheet wave generators often required separate pools and elevated containers for 
storing water for use in operating the sheet wave generating device. Elevated containers are 
not only costly to build, but in the case of a contained inclined surface, water is predisposed 
to undesirably flood the lower inclined container during the start-up and shut-down phases. 
Furthermore, the design of the previous prior art inclined containers were disadvantageously 
inflexible in their ability to self-clear water during operation (e.g., in the event of rider 
induced decay). Also, due to the need for water to flow over the upper edge of the incline, 
variable size wave shapes for differing levels of rider expertise could not be provided. There 
is, therefore, a need for a more compact sheet wave generating water ride design which 
overcomes the disadvantages of prior inclined containers, and yet provides the thrill of 
simulated water skimming activities.  
 EP-A-0 096 216 and US-A-4 805 897 disclose water rides in 
accordance with the pre-characterising parts of claims 1 and 2. 
In each of these water rides a forced flow travels up an inclined 
surface and

<CLAIMS>
A water ride for water parks, amusement parks, and the like, 
comprising a riding surface (20) which is associated with a 

source of water (21) and which has an inclined portion rising 
above the surface elevation of the water in the said source of 

water (21), and at least one water jet (30) for providing a sheet 
flow of water onto the inclined portion of the riding surface 

(20) upon which a rider may perform water skimming maneuvers, 
characterised in that the inclined portion of the riding surface 

(20) has an embanked turn thereon, the said flow of water flowing 
up on the embanked turn and then transitioning around on the 

embanked turn and returning downwards on the embanked turn, the 
returning flow re-entering the source of water (21). 
A self-contained water ride for water parks, amusement 
parks, and the like, within a single container of water, 

comprising: 

a source of water (21); 
an inclined surface (20) disposed above the source of water 
(21); and 
at least one water jet (30) for providing a sheet flow of 
water on the inclined surface (20), the sheet flow of water 

permitting a rider to perform water skimming maneuvers thereon; 
 
   characterised in that the inclined surface (20) is 

configured to form an embanked turn upon which the sheet flow of 
water is propelled upward and away from the source of water (21) 

and then transitions around on the embanked turn and returns back 
downward on the embanked turn, the returning flow re-entering the 

source of water (21) such that substantially all of the water is 
contained in the said single container without requiring a separate 

return conduit.  
 
A water ride as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the said flow of 
water is supercritical. 
A water ride as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, wherein the water 
jet (30) is located at or below the surface elevation of the 

water in the source of water (21), whereby a rider may pass over 
the water jet (30) and enter onto the inclined surface (20) 

directly from the source of water (21). 
A water ride as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, wherein the water 
jet (30) is located above the surface elevation of the water in 

the source of water (21), the said flow of water travelling 
downward onto a declining surface (104) before travelling up an 

incline portion (105) on the inclined surface (20). 
A water ride as claimed in any of claims 1 to 5, wherein the 
inclined surface (20) comprises two substantially similar but 

reversely oriented inclined surfaces (32), each of which is 
configured to enable the said flow of water to transition around 

and return downwardly towards the source of water (21). 
A water ride as claimed in any of claims 1 to 6, wherein the 
inclined surface (20) has an inclined portion having an upper 

edge (36) rising above the surface elevation of the water in the 
source of water (21), the inclined surface (20) being configured 

so that the said flow of water moves upward and around the inside 
of the upper edge (36), the said flow of water being contained 

within or by the upper edge (36) and being returned back into the 
source of water (21).
