<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus is presented for economically making 
crystallized glass products from waste ash produced from the 

sewage sludge dewatered by organic matters, which is usually 
regarded to be difficult to process. The melting is performed 

in two furnaces: the primary melting furnace and the secondary 
melting furnace. The primary furnace melts waste ash and the 

primary melt is charged into the secondary melting furnace. The 
glassy material produced in the secondary melting furnace is 

charged into a crystallization furnace to convert the glassy 
material to a crystallized glass product. This basic 

configuration of the apparatus allows the production of either 
irregular shaped crystallized products, such as crushed stone 

like products, or crystallized manufactured products, such as 
tiles and blocks, depending on the combination of processing 

equipment and their operating conditions. The apparatus enables 
the production of crystallized glass products from waste ash 

feed economically, because of the flexibility and versatility in 
the design of the apparatus.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to a method for
making crystallized glasses, and relates in particular to a
method for making crystallized glass products from waste ashes
produced from incinerating sludges and industrial and public
wastes.With increasing concern for preservation of environment,
there is an increasing recognition for the importance of
reducing and recycling waste materials. Effective utilization
of sludges produced from sewage and industrial water treatment
facilities is also an important aspect of reducing the need for
landfill and preserving the natural environment.The present invention relates to an apparatus for producing
products similar to such materials as pebbles, stones, and
crushed stones, and to an apparatus for producing such
manufactured products as tiles and blocks, using the method for
producing crystallized glasses which has been disclosed earlier
in a Japanese Patent Application, First Publication, H2-413772.There are conventional furnaces for melting waste ash
materials produced from incinerating sewage sludge and other
types of wastes, such as rotary furnaces, coke beds (or vertical
shaft furnaces), surface melting furnaces, arc furnaces, plasma 
furnaces and microwave melting furnaces. However, the slags
produced from these conventional melting furnaces are glassy
types which are only useful as low grade construction materials
such as road fill. There has been proposals to slowly cool or
treat the melted materials to produce crystallized aggregates.
The crystallized aggregates made by such methods (Japanese
Patent Application, First Publication, S56-54248, Japanese
Patent Application, First Publication S56-54247) are used as
concrete admixtures.The crystallized glass products made by the method of the
present invention are far superior to those made by the
conventional methods mentioned above, and the details of this
method has already been disclosed in a Japanese Patent
Application, First Publication H2-413772.The building materials using crystallized glass are made by
two approaches: one approach is to melt a feed material of an
appropriately adjusted composition in a conventional glass
furnace and after making formed glass, heat treating and
crystallizing steps are performed on the formed glass; the other
approach is to prepare particulate shaped glass first from a
melt, and shaped glass is made by heat treating and
crystallizing step is performed on the shaped glass. However,
there has been no proposal for an apparatus using waste
materials for feed and
