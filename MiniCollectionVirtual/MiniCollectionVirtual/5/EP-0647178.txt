<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a device for the continuous manufacture of slabstock polyurethane foam comprising conveyor means (1), a mixing head (51) and means (6) for discharging the reaction mixture from the mixing head (51) onto the conveyor means (1). The device comprises moreover a start board (7), a stop board, means for moving the start board (7) along the conveyor means at the beginning of a production run in such a manner that it obstructs the moving reaction mixture to thereby increase the height of the first portion of the produced foam, and means for moving the stop board at the end of a production run in such a manner that it pushes the foaming reaction mixture ahead to thereby increase the height of the end portion. In this way, no operator has to enter the foaming machine and the start and end profiles of the foam blocks are optimised.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device 
for the continuous manufacture of slabstock polyurethane 
foam comprising conveyor means, a mixing head for mixing 
polyurethane reaction components containing a blowing 
agent, means for discharging said reaction mixture onto 
said conveyor means and means for driving said conveyor 
means. Such a device is generally known. In 
practice, use is made of different types of continuous 
foaming machines including the conventional inclined 
conveyor machines, either with or without planiblock, 
maxfoam and varimax machines. A problem with these 
known continuous foam production machines is that a 
manual operation is required as well at the beginning of 
a foam production run as at the end thereof in order to 
obtain a useful front and end portion of the slabstock 
foam. Without the manual intervention of an operator, 
both the first and the last foam portion of a production 
run would decline slowly to the respective extremity of 
the slabstock foam resulting in a loss of several meters 
of foam. In the known machines, the operators use for 
example a board fixed at the end of a long pole to 
retain the first portion of reaction mixture while they 
stand on the first conveyor. As the conveyor starts 
running, the start board retaining the foaming reaction 
mixture moves also over the conveyor means. At the end 
of a production run, the operators push the last portion 
of reaction mixture forwards in order to obtain an end 
portion of the desired height. A drawback of the known devices consists in 
that in some cases the operators have to enter the 
foaming machines both at the start and at the end of a  
 
production run to realize the desired foam profile. It 
is clear that this may be dangerous and harmful to their 
health due to the production of noxious gases during the 
foam process. Moreover, the obtained foam profile depends 
on the skill and experience of the operator. In fact, 
the operator has no direct control of the foam height 
but the effect of the manual manipulation of the foaming 
reaction mixture can only be seen after a certain time, 
more particular after the time required by the foam to 
reach its final height. Further, the rise process of 
the reaction mixture depends on its composition, and 
more particularly on its blowing agent content, so that 
this composition has also to be taken into account when 
manipulating the reaction mixture to obtain the desired 
foam profile. An object of the present invention is to 
provide a device for the
