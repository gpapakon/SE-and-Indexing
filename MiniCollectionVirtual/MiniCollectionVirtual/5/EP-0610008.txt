<ABSTRACT>
A multi-layer article (40) that includes a layer 
of a water-soluble polymer that provides a water-removable, 

non tacky film (34) over an adhesive layer and/or 
acts as an adhesive for securing the multi-layer 

article to a substrate, such as concrete, when wetted. 
The article forms a water barrier capable of being 

secured to an area of potential water flow including a 
layer of flexible, water-impermeable sheet material 

having a layer of adhesive coated thereover, and a 
continuous or discontinuous coating of a water-soluble 

polymer thereon. When the water-soluble polymer is 
wetted to at least partially solubilize the water-soluble 

coating, the polymer and/or the underlying 
adhesive layer readily adheres the article to a 

substrate at the area of potential water flow. In a 
preferred embodiment, the flexible sheet material 

includes a layer of adhesive (tacky material) and the 
adhesive layer is coated with the layer of water-soluble 

polymer to eliminate the necessity of using a 
sheet of release paper to prevent the adhesive layer 

from adhering to itself, when in roll form, and during 
handling and installation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a multilayer 
article that includes a layer of a water-soluble 
polymer that provides a water-removable, non-tacky film 
over an adhesive layer and/or acts as an adhesive for 
securing the multi-layer article to a substrate, such 
as concrete, when wetted. More particularly, the 
present invention is directed to a water barrier 
capable of being secured to an area of potential water 
flow including a layer of flexible, water-impermeable 
sheet material having a continuous or discontinuous 
coating of a water-soluble polymer thereon. When the 
water-soluble polymer is wetted to at least partially 
solubilize the water-soluble coating, the polymer 
readily adheres the article to a substrate at the area 
of potential water flow. In a preferred embodiment, 
the flexible sheet material includes a layer of 
adhesive (tacky material) and the adhesive layer is 
coated with the layer or water-soluble polymer to 
eliminate the necessity of using a sheet of release 
paper to prevent the adhesive layer from adhering to 
itself, when in roll form, and during handling and 
installation. For more than 25 years waterproofing 
substrates, in the form of flexible sheet materials, 
have been manufactured for waterproofing areas of 
potential water flow, such as over concrete decks,  
 
plaza decks, concrete foundations, and the like. One 
such waterproofing sheet material manufactured by 
W. R. Grace & Co., is called BITUTHENE® formed from a 
water-impermeable membrane, such as polyethylene, 
polypropylene or polyvinyl chloride, and a layer of a 
bituminous composition containing asphalt, tar or pitch 
and natural or synthetic rubber, having a ratio by 
weight of bitumin to rubber greater than about 80:20, 
and up to about 95:5, as described in U.S. Patent 
Nos. 3,900,102 and 3,741,856 of John Hurst. As 
disclosed in the Hurst patents, because of the adhesive 
nature of the bituminous adhesive layer, a protective 
coating is needed, such as siliconized release paper, 
that is removably adhered to the bituminous adhesive 
composition layer to prevent the adhesive layer from 
adhering to itself during manufacture, handling and 
installation, or upon manufacture of the waterproofing 
material in roll form. In order to install the 
waterproofing article at an area of potential water 
flow, it is necessary to remove the release paper, in 
very large and cumbersome sheets, from the adhesive 
layer for contact of the adhesive layer against the 
area of potential water flow, e.g., against a

<CLAIMS>
A water barrier adapted to be secured to an 
area of potential water flow, comprising a layer of 

flexible, water-impermeable sheet material having a 
layer of adhesive adhered thereto and a dried coating 

of a water-soluble polymer coated over the layer of 
adhesive. 
A water barrier as claimed in claim 1, 
wherein the coating of water-soluble polymer is coated 

essentially continuously, and coextensive with the 
sheet material. 
A water barrier as claimed in claim 1 or 2, 
wherein the coating of water-soluble polymer is coated 

discontinuously over the sheet material. 
A water barrier as claimed in any one of 
claims 1 to 3, wherein said sheet material is selected 

from the group consisting of polyethylene, 
polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, and water-impermeable 

copolymers including an ethylene, 
propylene, or vinyl chloride monomer. 
A water barrier as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims, wherein the water-soluble polymer is 

selected from the group consisting of: poly(vinyl 
alcohol) ; poly(vinyl acetate) ; copolymers of vinyl 

alcohol and vinyl acetate; polyvinylpyrrolidone; 
poly(acrylic acid) and its metal salts; and 

combinations thereof.

preceding claims, wherein the water-soluble polymer 

comprises polyvinyl alcohol having less than 25 mol 
percent vinyl acetate. 
A water barrier as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims, wherein the water-soluble polymer

15 mils. 
A water barrier as claimed in any one of the

A method as claimed in claim 9 or 10,
