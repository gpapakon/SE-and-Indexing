<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel light duty liquid detergent compositions 
with high foaming properties, containing a nonionic surfactant, at least one anionic 
surfactant, a Zwitterionic betaine surfactant and a dialkyl sulfosuccinate, all of which 
are dissolved in an aqueous medium. Nonionic surfactants are in general chemically inert and stable toward pH 
change and are therefore well suited for mixing and formulation with other materials. 
The superior performance of nonionic surfactants on the removal of oily soil is well 
recognized. Nonionic surfactants are also known to be mild to human skin. However, 
as a class, nonionic surfactants are known to be low or moderate foamers. 
Consequently, for detergents which require copious and stable foam, the application 
of nonionic surfactants is limited. There have been substantial interest and efforts to 
develop a high foaming detergent with nonionic surfactants as the major ingredient. 
Little has been achieved. The prior art is replete with light duty liquid detergent compositions containing 
nonionic surfactants in combination with anionic and/or betaine surfactants wherein 
the nonionic detergent is not the major active surfactant, as shown in U.S. Patent No. 
3,658,985 wherein an anionic based shampoo contains a minor amount of a fatty acid 
alkanolamide. U.S. Patent No. 3,769,398 discloses a betaine-based shampoo 
containing minor amounts of nonionic surfactants. This patent states that the low 
foaming properties of nonionic detergents renders its use in shampoo compositions 
non-preferred. U.S. Patent No. 4,329,335 also discloses a shampoo containing a 
betaine surfactant as the major ingredient and minor amounts of a nonionic surfactant 
and of a fatty acid mono- or di-ethanolamide. U.S. Patent No. 4,259,204 discloses a 
shampoo comprising 0.8-20% by weight of an anionic phosphoric acid ester and one 
additional surfactant which may be either anionic, amphoteric, or nonionic. U.S. 
Patent No. 4,329,334 discloses an anionic-amphoteric based shampoo containing a  
 
major amount of anionic surfactant and lesser amounts of a betaine and nonionic 
surfactants. U.S. Patent No. 3,935,129 discloses a liquid cleaning composition based on 
the alkali metal silicate content and containing five basic ingredients, namely, urea, 
glycerin, triethanolamine, an anionic detergent and a nonionic detergent. The silicate 
content determines the amount of anionic and/or nonionic detergent in the liquid 
cleaning composition. However, the foaming property of
