<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a solid state imager
with reduced smear and a method of manufacturing the same.In CCD (charge-coupled device) solid state imagers for
1-inch optical system HD (high definition) television receiver,
there are proposed CCD solid state imagers having a shunt line
structure in order to prevent a propagation delay of a transfer
clock applied to a vertical transfer register. In the
specification, "shunt line" is referred to as "low resistance
interconnection for connecting transfer electrodes of the same
phase".FIGS. 1 and 2 of the accompanying drawings show a
conventional FIT (frame interline transfer) type CCD solid state
imager having a shunt line structure, in particular, an example
of an imaging section thereof.As illustrated, a CCD solid state imaging device 1
comprises a silicon substrate 2 of a first conductivity type,
e.g., N type, a first well region 3 of a second conductivity
type, i.e., P type formed on the N-type silicon substrate 2, an
N-type impurity diffusion region 4, an N-type transfer channel
region 6 forming a vertical transfer register 5 and a P-type
channel stopper region 7, all of which are formed within the 
first P-type well region 3, a P-type positive electric charge
accumulation region 8 formed on the N-type impurity diffusion
region 4 and a second P-type well region 9 formed beneath the N-type
transfer channel region 6.A PN junction i between the N-type impurity diffusion
region 4 and the P-type well region 3 constructs a photosensor
section (photoelectric-conversion section) 10. The photosensor
section 10 serves as a pixel, and a plurality of photo-sensor
sections 10 are arranged in a matrix shape.A plurality of transfer electrodes 16 (16A, 16B) made
of polycrystalline silicon layer of first and second layers are
formed on the transfer channel region 6, the channel stopper
region 7 forming the vertical transfer register 5 and a read-out
gate section 11 through a gate insulating film 15. The transfer
channel region 6, the gate insulating film 15 and the transfer
electrodes 16 constitute the vertical transfer register 5. The
transfer electrodes 16 are extended in the horizontal direction,
respectively. The first layer polycrystalline silicon transfer
electrode 16A and the second layer polycrystalline silicon
transfer electrode 16B are overlapped each other in the area of
the adjacent photosensor sections 10.Shunt line layers 18 made of a first Al layer are
formed on the vertical transfer registers 5 through an
interlayer insulating layer 17 so as to
