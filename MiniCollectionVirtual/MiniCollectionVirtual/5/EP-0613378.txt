<ABSTRACT>
The invention comprises a method of enhancing the immunogenicity of an envelope virus glycoprotein in a host organism. The method comprises administering to the host a composition comprising the virus envelope glycoprotein and at least one oligopeptide derived from the amino acid sequence of the envelope glycoprotein, wherein the oligopeptide contains or corresponds to virus-neutralization epitopes. The method and compositions are useful for vaccinating against viruses, such as HIV, SIV, HTLV-I, HTLV-II, or any retrovirus capable of inducing AIDS in its natural host.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DescriptionINDUCTION OF PROTECTION AGAINST VIRAL INFECTION BY SYNERGY BETWEEN V PROTEINS AND VIRAL PEPTIDES.Technical FieldThis invention relates to a vaccination process, which involves the simultaneous or consecutive use of a priming antigen, in this case the glycoprotein from a virus, such as HIV, SIV or any lentivirus capable of inducing AIDS in its natural host, or from an HTLV-I or HTLV-II type retrovirus, and an amplifying composition comprised of synthetic oligopeptides, which are free or bound to. a carrier molecule and in which the oligopeptides correspond to the neutralization epitopes for this same glycoprotein. This invention also relates to a composition for use in the process.An effective vaccine composition against viruses must produce rapid neutralization of the viruses in order to prevent the viruses from possibly protecting themselves in a latent provirus form within the chromosomes of resting cell or from finding refuge in the cellular or tissue compartment where they would be beyond the reach of the immune system. Background ArtFrom previous experiments conducted with both chimpanzees in the case of HIV and macaques in the case of SIV, it is clear that inoculation of virus envelope glycoprotein alone does not make it possible to obtain a fully protective immune response. In particular, the virus envelope glycoprotein does not produce a sufficient level - neutralizing antibodies in order to provide protection against infection. 

 Accordingly, there exists a need in the art for a method of inducing a sufficient level of neutralizing antibodies against virus infection in a host susceptible to the infection by the virus. In addition, there exists a need in the art for a pharmaceutical composition for use in the method.Disclosure of the InventionThis invention aids in fulfilling these needs in the art. An object of this invention is to reinforce the immunogenicity of at least one envelope glycoprotein of a virus by combining the glycoprotein with at least one peptide, and preferably at different times a group of peptides, derived from the sequence of the envelope glycoprotein and corresponding to virus-neutralization epitopes, i.e. corresponding to amino acid sequences involved in the production of neutralizing antibodies in the host to which they are administered.Accordingly, this invention provides a method of enhancing the immunogenicity of an envelope glycoprotein of a virus in a host and a composition for use in this method. The method comprises administering to the host at least
