<ABSTRACT>
Creel, especially for warping machines, with thread-guide devices (13) which are assigned to the winding stations and which each have a thread clamp (14) which is switchable when the machine is at a standstill and which is assigned on the thread run-in side prebreaking rods (15) around which the thread (F) is looped in opposite directions, and with a thread-deflecting point located at a distance from the thread clamp (14) on the thread run-off side. In order to improve a creel having the features mentioned in the introduction, in such a way that the risk that impurities will be deposited in the thread clamps (14) is reduced considerably, it is designed so that, in the open thread clamp (14), the thread (F) is guided without contact by components of the thread-guide device (13) which are located on the thread run-in and thread run-off sides.

<CLAIMS>
Spool frame, particularly for warping machines
(11), comprising yarn guide devices (13) associated with the

spool stations (12) and which include respective yarn clamps
(14) which are operable when the machine is at a standstill

and which have associated advance brake rods (15) on the yarn
supply side around which yarns (F) are looped alternately, and

comprising a yarn deflecting station formed as a knock-off
needle (17) and spaced from the yarn clamp (14) on the yarn

take-off side thereof, 
characterised in that
 the yarn (F) is
guided without contact in the open yarn clamp (14) by the

knock-off needle (17) and by the advance brake rod (15k)
nearest to the clamp, with the advance brake rod (15k) nearest

to the clamp being fixed in position during the winding
operation, and wherein three advance brake rods (15) are

provided, of which the brake rod (15s) nearest to the spool
is also fixed in position, while the middle brake rod (15m)

is displaceable for varying of the looping.
Spool frame according to claim 1, 
characterised in
that
 the advance brake rod (15k) nearest to the clamp is
hollow and has at least one air nozzle (18) directed towards

the yarn clamp (14).
Spool frame according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised
in that
 at least two air nozzles (18) arranged vertically
above one another are provided at a spool station (12) to

produce an air curtain (19) for cleaning the yarn clamp (14)
and its surroundings.
Spool frame according to claims 1 to 3,

characterised in that
 the air curtain (19) is pivotally
movable and/or is movable in a translatory manner transversely

to the yarn running direction in the region of the spool 
station (12).
Spool frame according to one or more of claims 1 to
4, 
characterised in that
 three advance brake rods (15) are
provided, of which the two outer rods (15k, 15s) are

displaceable in relation to the middle rod (15m) during a
spool exchange.
Spool frame according to one or more of claims 1 to
5, 
characterised in that
 the air nozzles at the spool stations
(12) of an individual frame field (20) or at all spool

stations (12) of the frame (10) are simultaneously
pressurisable by compressed air.
Spool frame according to claim 6, 
characterised in
that
 the air nozzles (18) of different frame fields (20) are
pressurisable cyclically.
Spool frame according to claim 6 or 7, 
characterised
in that
 a compressed air reservoir is associated with each
frame field (20).
Spool frame according to one or more of claims 1 to
8, 
characterised in that
 the middle advance brake rods (15m)
of spool stations (12) of a spool frame (10) have a greater

looping of yarn around them the closer they are to the warping
machine (11).
