<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a Teletext signals receiver, 
under the form of a plurality of pages, inserted in the 

television signal, that can be of the static type, i.e. 
single pages, or of the file-page type, i.e. each made up of 

a plurality of sub-pages, that are substituted over time 
during the transmission cycle; the main characteristic of the 

invention consists in the fact that the receiver has means 
that allow for automatically adjusting the viewing duration 

of a sub-page of the chosen file-page.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a Teletext signals receiver,
under the form of a plurality of pages, inserted in the
television signal, that can be of the static type, i.e.
single pages, or of the file-page type, i.e. each made up of
a plurality of sub-pages, that are substituted over time
during the transmission cycle.As is known the main problem with teletext reception is the
difficulty that characterises the selection of the pages that
one wishes to consult.Some means have been found for limiting a part of such
difficulties; various modified teletext transmission systems
have been proposed (the FLOP system, the TOP system, etc.);
increasingly sophisticated decoders have been developed.However one of the greatest inconveniences is that of the so
called rolling pages; that are actually files of sub-pages,
in reality the page number identifies the file and not the
single sub-page; it is not therefore possible to directly
select a single sub-page (i.e. to give a command that
immediately makes it available without having to wait for the 
other sub-pages of the file to be received first, existing
between that being transmitted in that moment and that
desired by the user; in fact even the use of the "time" key
does not remove the fact that one has to wait until the sub-page
is transmitted); it is noted that the single sub-pages
are substituted one with the other in the transmission cycle
over an established time, for example one every 20 seconds.As an example, which we may assume refers to the Italian
teletext, named Televideo by the RAI. It is supposed that
page 677 is selected, which is a file-page of 6 sub-pages. At
the moment in which the page is acquired by the decoder sub-page
n. 2 is actually being transmitted; after approximately
20 seconds it is substituted by sub-page n. 3; after another
20 seconds by sub-page n. 4 and so on.The user may find himself in a situation in which he has not
finished reading the sub-page 2, which is automatically
substituted by the successive; the user therefore has to read
the 3rd, then the 4th, then the 5th, then the 6th, then the
1st, finally, he can finish reading the 2nd, that he had not
finished reading before. It is true that with the STOP (or
HALT) key it is possible to stop the rotation; but when the
STOP is removed, the sub-page present in that moment of the
cycle is acquired; it would therefore occur that, if the user
had blocked the sub-page 2 at the beginning of the present
example, upon releasing it he would have found the sub-page 4
or 5; the remedy in

<CLAIMS>
Teletext signal receiver, for receiving a plurality
of pages, inserted in the television signal, said pages

being of the static type, or of the file-type, where each page is
made up of a plurality of subpages, that are

substituted over time during the transmission cycle,

characterised in that, in order to allow for
automatically adjusting the viewing duration of a

subpage of the chosen file-page, the receiver
comprises means for performing the following method steps:


a) the subpage being transmitted, is displayed and
memorized in a free page memory;
b) the number of characters that make up the text of
the displayed sub-page is counted and a time duration is

calculated for the displayed subpage to be kept on
display, said time duration being proportional to the number

of the counted characters, according to a
predetermined number of characters/time factor;
c) as soon as a next subpage is transmitted, it is
acquired and memorized in another free page memory;
d) as soon as the calculated time is passed, the
display of the displayed subpage is interrupted and

the corresponding page memory is freed;
e) the next subpage is displayed;
f) steps b) to e) are repeated until a command by the
user is received.
Teletext signal receiver, according to claim 1,

characterized in that said means for performing the method
steps is a microprocessor (8) contained in said

receiver.
