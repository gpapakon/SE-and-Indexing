<CLAIMS>
A process for preparing an oxidation product of
polyarylene sulfide comprising the recurring unit

of the formula


in which the sulfur/oxygen ratio is from 1:0.1 to
1:1 and the sum of a and b is always 1, with the

proviso that a is zero if b is 1,

by oxidation of polyarylene sulfide having a mean
molecular weight of from 4 000 to 200 000 and

comprising recurring units of the formula


which is a 1,4-linked polyarylene sulfide having a
proportion of not more than 30% 1,2- and/or 1,3-linkages

on the aromatic ring, wherein the
oxidation is effected by means of ozone.
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
reaction is carried out at a temperature of from

-10°C to +80°C.
The process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the 
reaction is carried out in an ozone-containing gas

stream having a concentration of from 0.1% by
volume to 9% by volume of ozone.
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1
to 3, wherein the reaction is carried out in a

suspension.
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1
to 4, wherein the reaction time is at least one

minute and not more than 2 hours.
