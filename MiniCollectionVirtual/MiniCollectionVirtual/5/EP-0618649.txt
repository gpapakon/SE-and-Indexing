<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a fibre-optic amplifier which consists of at least one pumping coupler (2) having a pumping light source (1) and an erbium-doped fibre section (7) spliced onto the pumping coupler (2), in order to monitor the amplifier, at least one aligned detector is arranged on the splicing point (12) between the fibre section (7) and the outgoing transmission line in order to measure the stray light produced at this splicing point (12). An electrical evaluation device is connected downstream of the detector.

<CLAIMS>
A fiber-optic amplifier comprising at least one 
pump coupler (2) having several ports, a pump source 

(1) connected to a first port (3) of the pump coupler, 
and an amplifying length of fiber (7) having one end 

connected to another port (5) of the pump coupler, the 
free end of the amplifying length of fiber (7) and a 

further port (4) of the pump coupler serving to 
connect the fiber-optic amplifier to optical 

transmission lines (9; 8),
characterized in
 that at at least one 
end of the amplifying length of fiber (7), at least 

one detector (13, 15) pointed at the splice (11, 12) 
present at each end of the amplifying length of fiber 

is provided for measuring the scattered light (S1', 
P1', S2', P2') leaking from the splice (11, 12). 
A fiber-optic amplifier as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that two or more detectors (13, 15) 

are pointed at the splice (11, 12) present at each end 
of the amplifying length of fiber (7). 
A fiber-optic amplifier as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that the detector (13, 15) converts 

pump light (P1, P2) contained in the scattered light 
(P1', P2') into electric signals.  

 
A fiber-optic amplifier as claimed in claim 3, 
characterized in that the detector (13, 15) is 

preceded by means which only allow pump light (P1, P2) 
to pass. 
A fiber-optic amplifier as claimed in claim 4, 
characterized in that the output of the detector (13, 

15) is fed to an evaluating device, and that the 
evaluating device turns the fiber-optic amplifier off 

when the detector signal exceeds a predetermined 
threshold. 
A fiber-optic amplifier as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that the at least one detector (13, 

15) is associated with the input-side splice or the 
output-side splice (12) of the amplifying length of 

fiber (7), depending on the propagation direction of 
the signal light. 
A fiber-optic amplifier as claimed in claim 6, 
characterized in that the detector (13, 15) converts 

signal light (S1, S2) contained in the scattered light 
(S1', S2') into electric signals. 
A fiber-optic amplifier as claimed in claim 7, 
characterized in that the detector (13, 15) is 

preceded by means which only allow signal light (S1, 
S2) to pass. 
A fiber-optic amplifier as claimed in claim 8, 
characterized in that the output of the detector (13, 

15) is fed to an evaluating device, and that the  
 

evaluating device turns the fiber-optic amplifier off 
when the detector signal falls below a predetermined 

threshold. 
A filter-optic amplifier as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that the at least one detector (13, 

15) is associated with a respective output-side splice 
(10, 11 or 12) of the amplifying length of fiber (7) 

depending on the propagation direction of the signal 
light.
