<ABSTRACT>
Polypropylene foil-bonding agent-metal composites are disclosed, in which polypropylene modified by carboxyl groups and/or anhydride groups is used as bonding agent. In order to produce the polypropylene foil, polypropylene random copolymers are used which are constituted of 90 to 99 % by weight, preferably 93 to 99 % by weight, propylene and 1 to 10 % by weight, preferably 1 to 7 % by weight, comonomers with a molar mass distribution Mw:Mn in the 2 to 10 range, preferably 3 to 6 range, and a melt-flow index MFI at 230  C/2.16 kg in the 1 to 20 g/10 min. range, preferably in the 4 to 15 g/10 min. range. Also disclosed is the use of these composites for producing packaging containers.
