<ABSTRACT>
An ultra-high purity monosilane producing process comprises: introducing a monosilane feed gas which also serves as a heat source to the lower stage of a duplex rectification column which is sectioned into an upper stage, a middle stage and a lower stage by means of an intermediate portion reboiler-condenser (RC2) and a lower portion reboiler-condenser (RC1); cooling down the monosilane feed gas by cold in the lower portion reboiler-condenser (RC1) so that the higher boiling point components are separated from the monosilane feed gas; introducing the remaining lower boiling point components to the upper stage by way of the middle stage and the intermediate portion reboiler-condenser (RC2) and cooling down the remaining components by refrigeration in the top portion of the upper stage so that monosilane and a lower boiling point component are separated; and rectifying this monosilane as a reflux liquid, whereby ultra-high purity monosilane is obtained from the bottom portion of the upper stage.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a ultra-high purity monosilane 
producing process and a unit therefor, and especially to a process for 
producing ultra-high purity monosilane gas or liquid monosilane which is free 
from hydrogen having a lower boiling point than that of monosilane and from 
chlorides or the like having higher boiling points than that of monosilane by 
liquefying and rectifying a monosilane feed gas, and a unit therefor. In general, monosilane gas or the like is indispensable for the 
manufacture of super LSI, solar cells and photosensitive substances. A process for producing such monosilane gas by adsorption is 
described in JP-A-1063514. For such monosilane gas, monosilane gas having a high purity, for 
example of 99.9999 % or more is preferable. At present, however, processes 
and units capable of continuously obtaining such ultra-high purity monosilane 
gas as mentioned above have not yet been developed. The present invention is intended to achieve the aforementioned 
purpose. The ultra-high purity monosilane producing process according to the 
present invention is characterized by comprising : 
introducing a monosilane feed gas to the lower portion of a 
rectification column; indirectly cooling down and liquefying monosilane obtained through 
rectification of the feed gas by the rectification column, by refrigeration in the 
upper portion of the rectification column, thereby providing a reflux liquid; and rectifying the reflux liquid by contact with the feed gas so that 
components other than monosilane are separated from the feed gas, thereby 
obtaining ultra-high purity monosilane gas or liquefied monosilane and 
withdrawing a liquid containing chlorosilanes from the sump of the lower portion 
of the rectification column  
   and recycling said liquid containing chlorosilanes to a reactor column. Preferably, said rectification column is  
 
a 
duplex rectification column which is sectioned into an upper stage, a middle 
stage and a lower stage by means of respective reboiler-condensers disposed 
in each of its lower portion and intermediate portion so that the feed gas is 
cooled down and condensed by cold in the lower portion reboiler-condenser, 
thereby separating and removing higher boiling point components from the feed 
gas and the process further comprises a step of reducing the pressure of the remaining component; and 
introducing the pressure-reduced component to the middle stage of the duplex 
rectification column so that the pressure-reduced component is cooled down 
and
