<ABSTRACT>
A printer having a cut sheet feeder 5 which 
automatically feeds paper into a printing portion 4, an 

opening for cut paper 7 and a tractor 6 which feeds 
continuous paper to the printing portion to selectively use 

automatically-fed cut paper, manually-fed cut paper and 
continuous paper for printing. The printer has a paper 

receiving tray (manually-fed paper guide plate) 9 which can 
form the opening portion 7 between itself and a part 1a of 

the printer housing 1. The paper receiving tray is movable 
between a manual paper-feeding position which it forms the 

opening portion 7 and during manual paper-feeding guides 
printed cut paper into the opening portion, an automatic 

paper-feeding position which forms the opening portion 7 and 
during automatic paper-feeding receives printed cut paper, 

and a closed position to close off the opening 7. The 
tractor 6 is movable between a first position in which it 

moves the paper receiving tray 9 into the manual 
paper-feeding position, a second position to move the paper 

receiving tray 9 into the automatic paper-feeding position 
and a third position to move the paper receiving tray 9 into 

the closed position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a printer according to the 
precharacterizing portion of claim 1. A corresponding printer is known from GB-A-2221898 which 
includes a continuous paper feeding means for feeding 
continuous paper into a printing section of the printer and a 
cut paper supply cassette for operating said printer with cut 
paper. Said cassette is provided to be inserted into an 
opening which is accessible to said cassette after pivoting 
said continuous paper feeding means into a non-operating 
position. For operating said printer with continuous paper, 
said cassette has to be removed from the printer. When said 
cut paper cassette is inserted into said printer, a significant 
leakage of noise generated by a printer head may be recognized. In consideration of this conventional printer, it is an 
objective of the present invention to provide a printer which 
is simple in operation and capable of printing on continuous 
paper and cut paper and which could be operated at a reduced 
noise level. According to the present invention, this objective has been 
performed by a printer as defined in claim 1. According to a first embodiment of the present invention, there 
is provided a printer having an opening portion for cut paper 
for manually feeding sheets of cut paper into a printing 
portion between a printing head and a platen inside the 
printer, and having continuous paper feeding means for feeding 
continuous paper into the printing portion to selectively use 
manually-fed cut paper and continuous paper for printing, 
wherein the printer has a manually-fed paper guide plate which 
during manual paper feeding guides the cut paper into the  
 
opening portion and can form the opening portion between 
itself and a portion of the printer housing; the guide plate 
is mounted on the printer housing movably between a distant 
position in which it is distant from said part of the printer 
housing and forms the opening portion and a closed position 
where it abuts with said part of the printer housing and 
closes the opening portion; and the continuous paper feeding 
means engages with the guide plate and is mounted movably 
between a first position where the guide plate is moved into 
the distant position and a second position where the guide 
plate is moved into the closed position. Further, according to a second embodiment of the present invention, there 
is provided a printer having a cut sheet feeder which 
automatically feeds sheets of cut paper into a printing 
portion between a printing
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A printer capable of selectively using cut paper and 
continuous paper comprising: 


a printer casing (1); 
a printing head (2) and an internal platen (3), arranged 
inside the printer casing and defining a printing 

portion (4); 
a continuous paper feeding means (6), for feeding 
continuous paper into said printing portion; 
a cut paper feeding means for selectively feeding cut 
paper into said printing portion; and 
an opening (7) for cut paper serving as paper feeding 
opening for feeding cut paper into said printing portion 

(4)
characterized in that
a plate (9) is provided, which is mounted on said casing 
(1) of said printer and which serves as a guide member 

guiding cut paper into said opening (7) or serves as a 
tray receiving printed cut paper, and which is movable 

between a first position where it is distant from a part 
(1a) of said printer casing and forms said opening (7), 

and a closed position where it abuts with said part of 
said printer casing and closes said opening. 
A printer according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 
said continuous paper feeding means (6) engages with said 

plate (9), and is mounted moveably between a first 
position, at which said plate (9) is held in said first, 

distant position, and a second position, at which said 
plate (9) is moved into said closed position. 
A printer according to claims 1 or 2, 
characterised in
that
 said plate (9) is serving as a guide plate, to manually 
feed cut paper into said printing portion. 
A printer as claimed in 
claims 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 said printer has a 
cut sheet feeder (5), for automatically feeding sheets of 

cut paper into said printing portion, and wherein said 
plate (9) is serving as a paper receiving tray, receiving
