<ABSTRACT>
Method of destabilization of the secondary intrastrand structure of a simple strand polynucleotide, and capture of said polynucleotide. The method is characterized in that a device comprising an oligonucleotide attached to a support is placed in contact with a liquid phase containing said polynucleotide, at a temperature of below 50  DEG C, said oligonucleotide acting as a capture probe and containing a destabilizing sequence capable of hydridizing with a non self-complementary sequence involved in the polynucleotide's secondary structure. The invention also concerns a device for carrying out said method.
