<ABSTRACT>
A surgical drill assembly (10) is provided having 
a clutch mechanism (62) that requires a sufficient axial 

load on cutting surfaces (27,34) of the drill to enable 
rotation of the drill. Rotation of the drill ceases 

almost immediately upon the axial load falling below 
the predetermined axial load threshold. In one 

embodiment the drill assembly (10) is disposable, and is 
virtually impossible to disassemble and reassemble to 

an operative form. In another embodiment the drill 
assembly is reusable. The reusable embodiment 

includes a drill body that enables quick and easy 
attachment and detachment of a drill head. The 

resuable drill body is of a unitary construction that 
can be sterilized and reused without any disassembly.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to surgical drill
assemblies useful for penetrating bone.Many surgical techniques require the
perforation or drilling of bone. Cranial surgery, in
particular, requires control over the cutting depth
of a drill so that drilling takes place only through
bone and not through the delicate dura underlying the
bone. During surgery that requires penetration of
the skull it is critical that drill rotation cease
once the skull is effectively perforated, and before
any damage is done to underlying dura.There exist cranial perforators that permit
drill bit rotation only when the drill bit is
subjected to an axial load of a desired magnitude.
Once the load is removed, or falls below a
predetermined threshold, rotation of the drill
ceases. Such devices that utilize a clutch mechanism
which enables a driver to be engaged only upon
sufficient axial load are disclosed in U.S. Patent
Nos. 2,842,131; 4,362,161; 4,319,577; 4,884,571; and
4,699,550.Many existing surgical drill constructions
utilize reusable drill bits and drill assemblies.
After use, it is necessary to disassemble the drill,
sterilize the drill components, and reassemble the
drill before a subsequent use. Disassembly and 
reassembly is undesirable because it is time
consuming, labor intensive, and because there always
exists the possibility that reassembly will not be
performed correctly. Such disassembly and reassembly is necessary in
US Patent 4319577. Improper reassembly of such a
drill can lead to drill failure and consequently to
patient injury or death. There is thus a need for
economical and effective disposable surgical drill
assemblies. It would also be advantageous to provide
reusable surgical drill assemblies that can be
rapidly and effectively disassembled and reassembled.US Patents 4,319,577 and 4,362,161 provide effective clutch mechanisms.
However, they permit bidirectional rotation of the drill.It is thus an object of the invention to
provide a construction for a bone drill assembly that
efficiently and effectively disables drill bit
rotation when the drill bit is no longer subjected to
a sufficient axial load and that does not allow counterclockwise
drive of the drill. A further object is to
provide such a drill assembly that is disposable.
Another object is to provide a reusable drill that is
easily disassembled and reassembled. It is also an
object to provide a reusable drill that does not
require disassembly of components before
sterilization. These and other objects, features and
advantages of the present
