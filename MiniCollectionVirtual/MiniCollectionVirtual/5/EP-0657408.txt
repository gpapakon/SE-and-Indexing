<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the gas phase catalytic fluorination of saturated halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons by means of HF. Use is made of a bulk or supported catalyst based on chromium oxide or on chromium oxides and on at least one other catalytically active metal in which the major part of the oxide or oxides is in the crystalline state. For a bulk catalyst, the specific surface, after activation with HF, is at least equal to 8 m

Process for the gas phase catalytic fluorination of 
saturated halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons by means of 

hydrofluoric acid in the presence of a bulk or supported 
catalyst based on chromium oxide or oxides of chromium 

and of at least one other catalytically active metal, 
characterized in that the major part of the oxide(s) is 

in the crystalline state and in that, in the case of a 
bulk catalyst, its specific surface, after activation 

with HF, is at least equal to 8 m

Process according to Claim 1, in which the metal 
associated with the chromium is chosen from the group 

consisting of the following elements: magnesium, nickel, 
zinc, iron, cobalt, vanadium and manganese. 
Process according to Claim 2, in which the atomic 
ratio: other active metal/chromium is lower than 1.2 and 

preferably between 0.1 and 1. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 3, in which 
the crystalline phases consist of the oxides Cr

 or a mixture of 
these oxides. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 4, in which 
the catalyst is obtained by subjecting an amorphous 

catalyst to a heat treatment in conditions which are 
sufficient to obtain the crystallization of the active 

species. 
Process according to Claim 5, in which the treatment 
is performed under an inert or oxidiz
ing atmosphere at a 
temperature of between 300 and 750°C, preferably between 

400 and 700°C.  
 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 6, in which, 
before the fluorination of the saturated halogenated 

aliphatic hydrocarbon, the catalyst is activated by means 
of HF at a temperature of between 100 and 350°C. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 7, in which 
the halogenated hydrocarbon to be fluorinated is a C

compound containing one or more hydrogen atoms. 
Application of the process according to one of 
Claims 1 to 7 to the fluorination of 1-chloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethane 

to 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane.
