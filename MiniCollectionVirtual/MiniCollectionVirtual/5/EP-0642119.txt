<CLAIMS>
Slider for magnetic recording, comprising at least one ski (12, 14)
with a front portion and a rear portion, read and/or write means (16) located

to the rear of the slider, the front portion of each ski having a first (31)

and a second (33) risers with, respectively, a first (30) and a second (32)
superimposed steps, said slider being characterized in that the first riser

(CM1) of the first step (M1) forms with the longitudinal direction (50) of
the ski a first angle (α1) between approximately 10° and approximately 60°

and in that the second riser (CM2) of the second step (M2) forms with the
longitudinal direction (50) of the ski a second angle (α2), which differs

from the first (α1), and is between approximately 20° and approximately 80°,
the first and second angles being measured in the same trigonometric direction.
Slider according to claim 1, characterized in that the height (h1) of the
first riser (CM1) is between approximately 20 nm and approximately 200 nm and

in that the height (h2) of the second riser (CM2) is between approximately
200 nm and approximately 2 µm.
