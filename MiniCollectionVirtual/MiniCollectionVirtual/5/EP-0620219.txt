<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing sulfolane compounds is provided which 
comprises: (1) contacting a conjugated diene with sulfur dioxide under 

conditions sufficient to synthesize a sulfolene compound whereby a 
mixture of the sulfolene compound and impurities comprising unreacted 

sulfur dioxide is produced; (2) transferring the mixture, at a 
temperature in the range of about 55°C to about 85°C, to an impurities 

removal reactor containing a solvent; (3) removing the impurities under 
an elevated pressure to produce an impurities-reduced sulfolene 

compound; (4) transferring the impurities-reduced sulfolene compound to 
a hydrogenation reactor; (5) contacting said impurities-reduced 

sulfolene compound with hydrogen, in the presence of a hydrogenation 
catalyst, under conditions sufficient to produce a sulfolane compound; 

and (6) optionally recovering said sulfolane compound.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for producing sulfolane
compounds from a conjugated diene and sulfur dioxide.Sulfolane compounds are useful in a variety of industrial
applications such as, for example, in pesticidal compositions,
intermediates in the production of other organic chemicals, selective
solvents to separate aromatic compounds from petroleum fractions, and
selective solvents in alkylation of olefins.Sulfolane compounds are generally prepared by catalytic
hydrogenation of the corresponding sulfolene compounds. The sulfolene
compounds are prepared by the reaction of a conjugated diene such as,
for example, 1,3-butadiene, and sulfur dioxide at elevated temperatures.However, the sulfolene compounds thus-produced are generally
unstable and tend to decompose at mildly elevated temperatures into an
unsaturated organic compound and sulfur dioxide. Furthermore, when the
sulfolene compounds are used to prepare the corresponding sulfolane 
compounds by catalytic hydrogenation, the initiation of hydrogenation
reaction may also increase the temperature enough to result in some
decomposition of the sulfolene. Some of these decomposed products
polymerize and the resulting polymer coats the hydrogenation catalyst
significantly reducing its activity. Moreover, unreacted sulfur dioxide
and the sulfur dioxide obtained from decomposition of sulfolene
compounds also interfere with the subsequent catalytic hydrogenation.
These sulfur dioxides must be removed or substantially reduced.Processes have been developed for inhibiting the formation of
polymers and reduction of sulfur dioxide in the production of sulfolane
compounds. For example, amines have been used as inhibitors in reducing
the amount of polysulfone polymer formation. Oxidizing agents have been
used to reduce sulfur dioxide and other impurities.
The US-A 3,514,469 describes a process for the production of a sulfolene compound
utilizing a metal peroxide to treat the sulfolene feed prior to hydrogenation. Excess
sulfur dioxide can be removed at atmospheric pressure or below.The US-A 3,622,598 also describes a process for the production of an sulfolene compound,
using Hydrogen peroxide and reduced pressure during the workup procedure. However, there is
an ever present need to develop still more effective methods of reducing
the polymer formation, the removal of sulfur dioxide and impurities, and
the hydrogenation process so that the amount of hydrogenation catalyst
used can be reduced and the production of sulfolane compounds can he
greatly improved.An
