<ABSTRACT>
New 6-[X-(2-hydroxyethyl)aminoalkyl]-5,11-dioxo-5,6-dihydro-11H-indeno[1,2 -c]
isochinoline derivatives represented by general formula (I), in which X stands for the number of carbon atoms from 0 to 5 in aminoalkyl group situated on nitrogen atom in position 6 of the indenoisochinoline fundamental structure, their salts with inorganic and organic acids and their derivatives were described. Antitumorously effective indenoisochinoline derivatives are most preferably prepared by the process in which the indeno[1,2-c]isocoumarine and/or 1-methoxy-2-(2-methoxycarbonylphenyl)-1-inden-3-one, respectively, comprises reacting with N-(hydroxyethyl)alkylen diamine in a medium of suitable aprotic solvent, preferably dimethylformamide, and at increased temperature. Another process for the preparation comprises reacting 6-(X-chloroalkyl)-5,11-dioxo-5,6-dihydro-11H-indeno[1,2-c]
isochinolines with 2-aminoethanol in suitable solvent, preferably dimethylformamide, in the presence of anhydrous potassium carbonate. New compounds, their derivatives and salts are useful for the preparation of drugs and compositions for the treatment of malignant neoplasias in mammals.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to 6-[X-(2-hydroxyethyl)aminoalkyl]-5,11-dioxo-5,6-dihydro-11H-indeno[1,2-c]isoquinolines 
of 
the general formula I 
 
in which X stands for the number of carbon atoms from 
0 to 5 in the aminoalkyl group situated on the nitrogen atom in 
position 6 of the indenoisoquinoline fundamental structure, 
their salts with inorganic and organic acids, and to 
a process of the preparation thereof. The subject compounds of general formula I (e.g. bases 
of compounds of general formula I) and their salts with 
pharmaceutically and pharmacologically acceptable acids, 
respectively, have usable antineoplastic activity and can be 
used in monotherapy and/or in combination with other 
antineoplastic drugs in the treatment of suitable biological 
subjects, especially of mammalian origin.  
 The pertinent literature reports certain indeno[1,2-c]isoquinoline 
derivatives as products of degradation 
of alkaloid cryptopine [Perkin V. H: J. Chem. Soc. 109, 815 
(1916); ibid. 115, 713 (1919); Dyke S. F., Brown D. V.: 
Tetrahedron 24, 1455 (1968)]. 11-H-indeno[1,2-c]isoquinoline 
and/or 5-hydroxy-11H-indeno[1,2-c]isoquinoline-N-oxide were 
prepared by reacting 11H-indeno[1,2-c]isocoumarine with 
ethanolic ammonia and/or hydroxylamine, respectively 
[Chatterjea J. N., Mukherjee H.: J. Indian Chem. Soc. 37, 
379 (1960)]. 5,11-dioxo-5,6-dihydro-11H-indeno[1,2-c]isoquinoline 
formed by reacting of 11-oxo-11H-indeno[1,2-c]isocoumarine 
with ethanolic ammonia under high pressure was described 
[Vawzonek S., Stowell J. K., Karll R. E.: J. Org. Chem. 31, 
1004 (1966)]. Indenoisoquinoline analogues of highly toxic nitidine 
and fagaronine have been also prepared [Cushman M., Mohan 
P., Smith E. C. R.: J. Med. Chem. 27, 544 (1984); Cushman 
M., Mohan P.: J. Med. Chem. 28,1031 (1985)]. The named indenoisoquinoline compounds did not exhibit 
any useful biological activity with the exception of 
indenoisoquinoline analogues of fagaronine and nitidine 
which showed a weak antineoplastic action. According to our knowledge, compounds of the present 
invention, 6-[X-(2-hydroxyethyl)aminoalkyl]-5,11-dioxo-5,6-dihydro-11H-indeno[1,2-c]isoquinolines 
of the general formula 
I in which X stands for a number of carbon atoms from 0 
to 5 in the aminoalkyl group situated on the nitrogen atom at position 
6 of the indenoisoquinoline fundamental structure (eg 
bases of compounds of general formula I) and their salts 
with pharmaceutically and pharmacologically acceptable acids, 
respectively, represent a new previously
