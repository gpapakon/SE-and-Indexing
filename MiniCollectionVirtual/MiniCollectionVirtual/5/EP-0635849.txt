<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for deflecting a particle beam (3) travelling along an axis (1) towards a target-point (2), on a target straight line (4) crossing the axis (1) at the target-point (2). Here, the particle beam (3) is deflected in front of the target-point (2) onto a first intermediate straight line (5), which forms an angle different from zero with a main plane (6) covered by the axis (1) and the target straight line (4). According to the invention, the particle beam (3) is deflected from the first intermediate straight line (5) onto a second intermediate straight line (7), which connects the first intermediate straight line (5) to the target straight line (4), and from the second intermediate straight line (7) onto the target straight line (4) at the target-point (2). The invention also relates to a device for implementing such a method. The invention is applied predominantly in guidance systems for particle beams (3), in particular for particle beams (3) of protons having energies of a few hundred MeV, which are used in the field of therapeutic treatment, in particular the therapeutic treatment of tumours.
