<ABSTRACT>
In a telecom system including a mobile telecom system 
comprising mobiles and mobile services switching centres, 

signalling between a mobile station and a mobile services 
switching centre with regard to handling operations of interest 

to supplementary services is performed by the aid of a support 
functionality in the mobile services switching centre. At 

receipt of an invoke component in an operation invoked by the 
mobile station, the support functionality analysis said 

component for identifying the corresponding operation and a 
receiving supplementary service of a requested supplementary 

service operation. The support functionality then performs 
syntax check on the data included in the component and specific 

to the operation in question, and sends on request of the 
supplementary service a response to the mobile station that has 

invoked the operation. In case of request of a supplementary 
service in the mobile services switching centre, which desires 

to send an invoke component regarding an operation to a mobile 
station, the support functionality allocates an identification 

value for the operation and sends the component in a relevant 
message to the mobile station.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a method for
performing in a telecom system signalling between a mobile
station and a mobile services switching centre with regard to
handling operations of interest to supplementary services. The
telecom system has functionality separated into basic
functionality comprising basic services and supplementary
functionality comprising supplementary services, and includes a
mobile telecom system including mobiles and mobile services
switching centres, which are able to communicate with each
other. Supplementary service procedures being descriptions of
forward and back message information components are defined by a
protocol by means of rules specifying said procedures as
operations. These components include data specific to an
operation and only known within a corresponding supplementary
service. Each operation in a supplementary service is identified
by an operation code included in each forward message
information component and including a value to which corresponds
a certain operation and which is specified in said protocol and
normally identifies a supplementary service receiving a
supplementary service operation.In modern telecommunications systems the functionality is
separated into basic functionality and supplementary
functionality. The basic functionality typically can include
basic services which are common to many markets whereas the
supplementary functionality can comprise supplementary services
which may be chosen separately in each market.Call related signalling for supplementary services relates to
the signalling carried through between a mobile station and a
mobile services switching centre for commonly controlling
supplementary services. This may e.g. involve a request from a 
mobile station to a mobile switching centre for setting up a
conference call.Non-call related signalling for supplementary services relates
primarily to the procedures used by a mobile station in GSM for
either changing data for supplementary services or for asking
the network about current data for supplementary services. This
may e.g. imply activation of a supplementary service, recording
data for a supplementary service, inquiry regarding data for a
certain supplementary service etc.In the signalling between a mobile station and a mobile
services switching centre the supplementary services procedures
are implemented in a protocol by means of rules according to the
concept for ROSE (Remote Operations Service Element - specified
in CCITT X.219 and X.220). This implies that

<CLAIMS>
A method for performing signalling between a mobile
station (MS) and a mobile services switching centre (MSC) with

regard to handling operations of interest to supplementary
services in a mobile telecommunications system having

functionality separated into basic functionality comprising
basic services and supplementary functionality comprising

supplementary services, and providing supplementary service
procedures, being descriptions of forward and back message

information components, being defined by a protocol by means of
rules specifying said procedures as operations, said components

including data specific to an operation and only known within a
corresponding supplementary service, and each operation in a

supplementary service is identified by an operation code
included in each forward message information component and

including a value to which corresponds a certain operation and
which is specified in said protocol and normally identifies a

supplementary service receiving a supplementary service
operation,

   wherein the method comprises the steps of

   using a support functionality in the mobile services
switching centre for performing the steps of

   receiving a forward message information component from the
mobile station, and


a) analysing (2,4) the received forward message information
component for identifying the value of operation code included

therein and thereby the corresponding operation and a receiving
supplementary service of a requested supplementary service

operation,
b) giving (10) the forward message information component to
said supplementary service,
c) performing (10) syntax check on the data included in said
component specific to the operation in question,
d) sending (12-16) on request of the supplementary service a
response to the mobile station that has invoked the operation,

   and further 
characterized by
 using said support
functionality for performing on request of a supplementary 

service in a mobile services switching centre (MSC), which
desires to send a forward message information component

regarding an operation to a mobile station (MS), 
characterized by
 the further
steps of


e) allocating (20) an identification value for the
operation,
f) sending (22) said component in a relevant message to the
mobile station,
g) establishing (24) whether a response in the form a back
message component has arrived from the mobile station in mobile

services switching center, and, if this is the case,
h) analysing (26) said operation identification value in
said back message information component for identifying the

service that invoked the operation, and
i) sending (28) said received component to the service thus
identified.
The method according to claim 1, comprising analysing (4)
in said component in step a) also a further parameter explicitly

identifying the supplementary service.
The method according to claim 1 or 2, comprising

   sending to said support function said components included in
auxiliary information elements in call related messages for

commonly controlling supplementary services, and in messages for
non-call related supplementary service procedures, said

auxiliary elements being able to carry an arbitrary number of

components belonging to different operations,

   performing step a) by analysing (2), at receipt of an
auxiliary information element (I.E.) in the mobile services

switching centre (MSC), in an operation invoked by the mobile
station (MS), said auxiliary information element for identifying

a forward message information component included therein,

   analysing (4) said component for identifying the value of
operation code included therein and thereby the corresponding

operation and a receiving supplementary service of a requested
supplementary service operation.
The method according to any of claims 1-3, comprising 
performing steps (a-d) so as to allow new supplementary services

to be sent for as a result of the analysis without affecting the
analysis proper, so that it is possible to include new operation

codes in the analysis and thereby identify new supplementary
services.
The method according to claim 4, comprising repeating (11)
in case more than one component is included in said auxiliary

information element, said analysing of a component until all
receiving supplementary services have been identified and have

received said component.
The method according to any of claims 1-5, comprising
forming (12) said response in step d) either as a positive

response, a message that the operation cannot be carried
through, or a rejection due to the syntax of the operation

having not been correctly formulated.
The method according to any of claims 1-6, comprising
forming said response in the step d) by the supplementary

service itself.
