<ABSTRACT>
The intention is, with an apparatus (1) for cooling hot moulding sand taken from a bunker (11), having a cooling section (2, 3) and a spraying device (9) for spraying on cooling water, to provide a solution by means of which essentially continuous operation of the cooling device is made possible even where the supply of sand fluctuates severely, while retaining the homogeneity of the cooled sand under fluctuating operating conditions. It is achieved by virtue of the fact that the bunker (11) is assigned a power-controlled discharge element (13) for supplying the cooling section (2, 3) with hot moulding sand and is also assigned a control device (17) for metering the quantity of water to be sprayed on as a function of the power of the bunker discharge element (13).

Apparatus (1) for cooling hot foundry moulding sand which is
withdrawn from a bin (11) having a cooling section (2, 3) and a spray

device (9) for applying cooling water characterised in that associated with
the bin (11) is a continuously output-regulated withdrawal member (13) for

supplying the cooling section (2, 3) with hot foundry moulding sand and a
regulating device (17) for metering the amount of water to be sprayed on in

dependence on the output of the bin withdrawal member (13), wherein the
regulating device (17) is designed to influence the pulse-pause ratio of

the spray device (9) in dependence on the sand delivery temperature and the
sand removal temperature determined by means of measuring probes (18, 19)

in the charging region (4) and the discharging region (5) respectively of
the cooling section (2, 3).
Apparatus according to claim 1 characterised in that the
withdrawal member is in the form of an endless conveyor (11) with a sand

discharge on to the cooling section (2, 3).
Apparatus according to claim 1 characterised in that the bin
outlet (12) is directly associated with the beginning of the cooling

section (2, 3), wherein a regulatable feed roller (20) is provided between
the bin outlet (12) and the beginning (4) of the cooling section as the

withdrawal member.
Apparatus according to one of the preceding claims characterised

in that the cooling section is in the form of an enclosed vibrating
conveyor (2) with an air-permeable bottom (7), with a cooling air feed

blower (8) beneath the bottom and a vapour outlet (10) at the end of the
cooling section.
