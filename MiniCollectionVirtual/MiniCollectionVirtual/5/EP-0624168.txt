<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an ethylene polymer having
an intrinsic viscosity of at least 4 dl/g and a method for
the preparation thereof. An ethylene polymer of this type
is disclosed in WO 87/03288. The ethylene polymer described
in this publication can be stretched at temperatures below
its melting point. To this end, the polymer is compressed to
form a film, which can be stretched to at least 15 times its
size at temperatures of 60-145°C. The stretched articles
have a tensile strength of greater than 15 g/den (1.3 GPa)
and a modulus of elasticity of greater than 500 g/den (45
GPa). The ethylene polymer is prepared through
polymerisation of ethylene in the presence of a vanadium-containing
catalyst at temperatures of, for example, -40°C
to 20°C and pressures of less than 0.2 MPa absolute
pressure. The polymerisation is carried out in the presence
of a homogeneous vanadium catalyst or a vanadium catalyst
applied to a support.If the ethylene polymers according to WO 87/03288
are prepared using a homogeneous vanadium catalyst, the
shape of the polymer obtained is irregular. The polymer has
the macroscopic form of fragments and threads having
dimensions of the order of one centimetre. Ethylene polymer
in such a form is not or barely processable on an industrial
scale.If the ethylene polymers according to WO 87/03288
are prepared using a heterogeneous vanadium catalyst, such
as a vanadium catalyst on a silica support (see the examples
in WO 87/03288), the amount of catalyst residues in the
polymer is high. In the examples this is 56-2310 ppm of 
vanadium. Such high contents of catalyst residues are
undesirable. The amount of catalyst residues is calculated
in a known manner from the polymer yield and the amount of
active catalyst component (vanadium or titanium) which is
supplied to the reactor.According to WO 87/03288, comparative experiment F,
titanium-containing catalysts having a high catalytic
activity give a polymer which is not readily stretchable.
The maximum degree of stretching is 5 at a stretching
temperature of 100°C.According to the invention there is provided an
ethylene polymer which has a maximum draw ratio of at least
20, is pulverulent, has a bulk density of at most 300 kg/m3
and has an amount of active catalyst component residues of less than 50 ppm.It has been found that some catalysts, under
specific conditions during polymerisation, lead to a highly
stretchable ethylene polymer, specifically when the
polymerisation of ethylene or of a mixture of ethylene and
not more than 5 mol% higher
