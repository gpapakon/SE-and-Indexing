<ABSTRACT>
In a semiconductor laser having a p-type cladding 
layer consisting of GaInP or AlGaInP, an operating 

voltage is decreased. In a semiconductor laser formed on 
a GaAs substrate and having a p-type cladding layer 

consisting of GaInP or AlGaInP and a p-type contact layer 
consisting of GaAs or GaInAs, p-type buffer layers are 

formed between the p-type cladding layer and the p-type 
contact layer, which consists of a compound containing 

both arsenic (As) and phosphorus (P) and having a medium 
bandgap between those of the two layers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor 
laser which can be used, for example, to excite an optical 
amplifier using an Er-doped quartz optical fiber. (EP-A-0 353 333 discloses a semiconductor laser comprising an 
n-type GaAs substrate and n-type cladding layer formed 
directly on the n-type GaAs substrate, an active region layer 
formed on the n-type cladding layer, a p-type cladding layer 
formed on the active region layer and consisting of AlGaInP, 
a p-type intermediate layer formed on the p-type cladding 
layer and consisting of a material having a composition 
containing arsenic and phosporus and having a band gap 
smaller than that of the material of the p-type cladding 
layer, a p-type contact layer formed on the p-type 
intermediate layer and consisting of GaAs having a band gap 
smaller than that of the material of the p-type intermediate 
layer, and electrodes formed on a lower surface of the n-type 
GaAs substrate and an upper surface of the p-type contact 
layer, respectively. The p-type intermediate layer may 
consist of GaInAsP. Patent Abstracts of Japan, volume 14, number 557 (E-1011), 
11-12-1990 and JP-A-2 240 988 discloses a semiconductor laser 
comprising a p-type GaAs substrate, a p-type diffusion layer 
formed in the GaAs substrate, a p-type cladding layer formed 
on the p-type diffusion layer and consisting of AlGaInP which 
has a band gap larger than that of the p-type diffusion 
layer, an active region layer formed on the p-type cladding 
layer, an n-type cladding layer formed on the active region 
layer, an n-type contact layer formed on the n-type cladding 
layer, and electrodes formed on a lower surface of the p-type 
GaAs substrate and an upper surface of the n-type contact 
layer, respectively. Optical amplifiers using Er-doped quartz optical 
fibers have attracted a great deal of attention as a core 
technology for an optical communication system of a 
future generation. As a pump source for the optical 
amplifier, a semiconductor laser having an operating 
wavelength of 1.48 or 0.98 µm is used. A 0.98-µm 
semiconductor laser currently reported has an active 
layer consisting of GaInAs and a cladding layer 
consisting of AlGaAs or GaInP. Semiconductor lasers using AlGaAs as a cladding 
material have good initial characteristics and high 
reliability on the average. However, some are suddenly 
deteriorated when being energized. At present, they 
cannot be removed by initial screening. To the contrary, 
such an accidental deterioration is expected to occure 
less
