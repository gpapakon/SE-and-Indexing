<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to vaccines which protect
against diphtheria toxin.Diphtheria toxin (DT) is a protein exotoxin
produced by the bacterium Corynebacteria diphtheria. The
DT molecule is produced as a single polypeptide that is
readily nicked to form two subunits linked by a disulfide
bond, Fragment A (N-terminal ~21K) and Fragment B (C-terminal
~37K), as a result of cleavage at residue 190,
192, or 193 (Moskaug, et al., Biol Chem264:15709-15713,
1989; Collier et al., Biol Chem,246:1496-1503, 1971).
Fragment A is the catalytically active portion of DT. It
is an NAD-dependent ADP-ribosyltransferase which
specifically targets a protein synthesis factor termed
elongation factor 2 (EF-2), thereby inactivating EF-2 and
shutting down protein synthesis in the intoxicated cell.
Fragment B of DT possesses a receptor-binding domain
which recognizes and binds the toxin molecule to a
particular receptor structure found on the surfaces of
many types of mammalian cells. Once DT is bound to the
cell via this receptor structure, the receptor/DT complex
is taken up by the cell via receptor-mediated
endocytosis. A second functional region on Fragment B
acts to translocate DT across the membrane of the
endocytic vesicle, releasing catalytically active
Fragment A into the cytosol of the cell. A single 
molecule of Fragment A is sufficient to inactivate the
protein synthesis machinery in a given cell.Immunity to a bacterial toxin such as DT may be
acquired naturally during the course of an infection, or
artificially by injection of a detoxified form of the
toxin (a toxoid) (Germanier, ed., Bacterial Vaccines,
Academic Press, Orlando, Fl., 1984). Toxoids have
traditionally been prepared by chemical modification of
native toxins (e.g., with formalin or formaldehyde
(Lingood et al., Brit. J. Exp. Path.44:177, 1963)),
rendering them nontoxic while retaining an antigenicity
that protects the vaccinated animal against subsequent
challenges by the natural toxin: an example of a
chemically-inactivated DT is that described by Michel and
Dirkx (Biochem. Biophys. Acta491:286-295, 1977), in
which Trp-153 of Fragment A is the modified residue.
However, such a chemically modified toxin may
occasionally lose the added chemical group or groups, and
revert to its active, toxic form, so that its use as a
vaccine poses a possible risk to the recipient.Another avenue for producing toxoids is by the
use of genetic techniques. A Corynebacterium diphtheriae
mutant, CRM-197 (Uchida et al., J. Biol. Chem.248:3838-3844,
1973; Uchida, et al.,
