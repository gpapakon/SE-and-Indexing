<ABSTRACT>
A method of measuring a delay time in a semiconductor 
device which has a particular circuit (104;202,203,204,205) 

subject to delay time measurement, a test circuit (105; 
209,210) coupled to an input terminal (101c; 201c,201d) of 

the particular circuit for bypassing the particular circuit, 
and a selector (103; 208) for selectively outputting 

either an output signal from the particular circuit or an 
output signal from the test circuit. The method includes 

the steps of: coupling an input signal generator (1) to the 
common input terminal (101c) and applying a test signal to 

both the particular circuit and the test circuit, coupling 
an output signal determination circuit (2) to an output 

terminal of the selector (103), detecting a signal on the 
output terminal of the selector, measuring the respective 

delay times occurring when the test signal passes through 
the particular circuit (104) and through the test circuit 

(105) by the input signal generator and the output signal 
determination circuit by switching the selector (103), and 

obtaining a delay time in the particular circuit by subtracting 
one of the delay times from the other. The delay 

time only in the particular circuit can be accurately 
measured without being influenced by a delay time occurring 

in the measurement equipment.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a semiconductor device, and 
more particularly to a semiconductor device having a circuit 
for measuring a delay time of a particular semiconductor 
circuit formed in the semiconductor device. The invention 
also relates to a method of measuring a delay time 
occurring in such semiconductor device. Fig. 1 shows a conventional timing correction system 
which has been proposed to correct a phase shift caused by 
a delay time occurring between input and output terminals 
of various kinds of circuits formed in a semiconductor 
device. The timing correction system shown in Fig. 1 
includes an input signal generation circuit 1 (hereinafter 
called a "driver 1") having timing correction arrangements, 
an output signal determination circuit 2 (hereinafter 
called a "comparator 2"), and a logic test input/output 
terminal 6 (hereinafter called a "logic test I/O pin 6") 
which is provided on a test board 5 and connected to both 
of the driver 1 and the comparator 2 in parallel through 
switches 3 and 4, whereby the phase shift (hereinafter  
 
called a "skew") is corrected. More specifically, the driver 1 includes a timing 
generator 7, a clock distributor 8, a clock selector 9, a 
signal wave modulator 10, an inter-pins timing adjustment 
circuit 11, a drive circuit (DR) 12, a skew register 13, 
and a D/A converter 14. On the other hand, the comparator 
2 includes a strobe distributor 15, a strobe selector 16, a 
comparator 17, a high level comparator (CMP) 18, a low 
level comparator 19, skew registers 20, D/A converters 21, 
a high level inter-pins timing adjustment circuit 22, and a 
low level inter-pins timing adjustment circuit 23. Timing correction in accordance with this conventional 
timing correction system will be conducted as follows. 
First, the logic test I/O pin 6, here a standard I/O pin, 
on the test board 5 is connected to the respective driver 1 
and comparator 2 through switches such as relay means. 
When correction is made on the driver 1, the standard I/O 
pin 6 is switched to be connected to the comparator 2 and 
all of the other I/O pins (not shown) are respectively 
switched to be connected to the drivers 1. The phase shift 
of signals appearing on the respective I/O pins connected 
to the drivers 1 against the standard clock is measured as 
the delay time. A central processing unit (hereinafter 
called a "CPU") converts the measured delay time into 
correction data to be applied to the timing correction  
 
arrangements. The correction data is transmitted to the
