<ABSTRACT>
A method for the production of a microsphere without 
use of a dispersion stabilizer is disclosed which permits the 

microsphere to be produced in the form of discrete particles 
readily treatable for purification. The method which produces 

this microsphere comprises the steps of dissolving in an 
organic solvent such as an alcohol a monomer mixture including 

an ethylenically unsaturated amide and 10 to 70% by weight, 
based on 100% by weight of said monomer mixture, of a cross-linking 

agent thereby preparing a mixed solution, keeping said 
mixed solution at a temperature in the range of from 30° to 95 

°C, and adding thereto at least one initiator selected from 
the group consisting of peroxide type initiators and azo type 

initiators in an amount such as to be contained therein at a 
final concentration in the range of from 7 × 10⁻⁵ to 8 × 

10⁻² mol/liter thereby inducing polymerization of said monomer 
mixture. The microsphere consequently obtained can be used as 

one kind of a substrate most suitable for the preparation of 
an affinity adsorbent serving ideally as a filler for use in 

affinity chromatography.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel microsphere and a
method for the production thereof.The affinity chromatography is now an indispensable
tool for persons who engage in works pertinent to organisms in
various fields ranging from basic through applied branches of
science. The dissertation presented by Cuatrecases et al.
[Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S., 61, 636-643 (1968)] may well be
credited with fully familiarizing these persons to this method
of analysis. Before the publication of this dissertation
prevailed the idea of preparing an affinity adsorbent as a
filler for use in affinity chromatography by fixing a ligand
having affinity for a substance under test fast with a
chemical bond on a substrate. This idea was not materialized
until the use of plastic beads as a substrate was abandoned as
unfit. The causes which used to obstruct the dissemination of
affinity chromatography have been removed by adopting agarose
gel beads as a substrate, also using a method of cyanogen
bromide activation for the fixation of a ligand, and further,
in the fixation of a ligand of low molecular weight on a
substrate, inserting a spacer between the ligand and the
substrate.The affinity chromatography has since disseminated
rapidly and, in consequence of the dissemination, numerous
researches have been launched in search of an optimum
substrate for the preparation of an ideal affinity adsorbent.
It is generally held that the substrate is expected to fulfill
such requirements as exhibiting hydrophilicity and chemical
inactivity, possessing an activable functional group,
abounding in physical and chemical stability, assuming the
form of gel beads of a sturdy and porous structure, and
featuring uniformity of size and toughness of the gel beads.Various kinds of substrates have been developed to
date. Since no one substrate can meet all the conceivable
purposes of analysis, various substrates such as cellulose, 
cross-linked dextran, agarose gel, polyacrylamide gel, porous
glass, polyhydroxy methacrylate gel, the gel produced by
polymerizing a hydrophilic vinyl monomer, and the copolymer of
agarose gel with polyacrylamide which are adapted for various
purposes of analysis are being developed.The polyacrylamide gel is at an advantage in being so
inactive biologically as to defy microorganic decomposition
and retaining stability in solutions of various salts,
surfactants, and guanidine hydrochloride normally used in
affinity chromatography so long as the pH value of solution is
in the range of from 2 to 10.Further, the
