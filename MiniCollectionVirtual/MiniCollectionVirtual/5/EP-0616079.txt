<ABSTRACT>
In order to mount a multistrand stay cable of a cable-stayed bridge between a pillar (tower) and the deck of this bridge, one of the strands (41) intended to constitute the stay cable is fitted in its final oblique position; a guide cage is suspended from this first strand thus fitted, which cage consists of a sequence of rigid bow struts (stirrup pieces) (5) connected together by small cables (6), the said cage surrounding the said first strand as well as a traction cable (9); using the said cable, the following strands (4) are pulled in succession into the cage; at the end of the traction of each strand, it is tensioned so as to apply it laterally against the strands already fitted, and its ends are anchored, respectively on the pillar and on the deck; and all of the strands have been fitted, the guide cage is released from the finished stay cable.

A method of mounting a multiple strand stay of a 
stayed bridge between a tower and the deck of said 

bridge, wherein the stay (3) is built up directly, 
strand by strand, in its final oblique position,
 
characterized by performing the following sequence of 

operations: one of the strands (4
1
) for making up the 
stay is installed in its final oblique position, this 

stage of installation being terminated by putting the 
strand under tension and anchoring its ends respectively 

to the tower (2) and to the deck (1); a guide cage for 
the following strands is suspended from said first strand 

installed in this way, the cage extending over the entire 
length of said strand and being made up of a sequence of 

rigid hoops (5) interconnected by strings (6), said cage 
surrounding said first strand and also surrounding a 

traction cable (9); the subsequent strands (4) making up 
the stay are pulled up successively inside the cage by 

means of said cable; after each strand has been pulled 
up, it is put under tension so that it bears laterally 

against the already-installed strand or set of strands, 
and its ends are anchored respectively to the tower and 

to the deck; and after all of the strands have been 
installed, the guide cage is removed from the completed 

stay. 
A method according to claim 1, for mounting the 
various oblique multiple-strand stays constituting a 

common vertical or substantially vertical sheet of a 
stayed bridge, the method being characterized in that the 

following operations are performed: initially the 
shortest bottom stay (3) is mounted, after which each of 

the other stays is mounted going progressively upwards 
from stay to stay and, when mounting the first strand 

(4'
1
) of each of the stays other than the bottom stay, 
use is made of the guide cage (5, 6) that has served for  

 
mounting the preceding stay, while said cage is still 

suspended from the preceding stay. 
A method according to any one of the preceding claims, for 
mounting two vertical or substantially vertical sheets (N
1,
 N
2
) of 
oblique stays on the same longitudinal side of a tower of 

a stayed bridge, the two sheets together forming an acute 
dihedral angle, the method being characterized in that 

two stays are mounted simultaneously, one for each of the 
two sheets, the stays being located at the same level and 

a single traction cable (9) being used that extends 
around a closed circuit in the form of an isosceles 

triangle defined by pulleys (16, 17
1
, 17
2
), the two equal 
long sides (AB
1
, AB
2
) of said triangle extending along the 
oblique axes of the two stays to be mounted, and the 

third side (B
1
B
2
) extending horizontally, across to the 
bridge, and including a reversibly rotatable winch (18) 

or the like. 
Mounting apparatus for mounting multiple strand stays 
by the method according to any one of the preceding claims, 

apparatus being characterized in that it comprises a 
guide cage for the strands (4) and the traction cable (9), the 

cage being made up of a succession of rigid hoops (5) 

interconnected by strings (6), each hoop comprising an 
arc (7) and an easily removable bottom closure bar (8). 
Mounting apparatus according to claim 4, characterized 
in that the guide cage comprises three parallel strings 

(6), one being attached to the tops (C) of the various 
arcs (7), and the other two strings being attached to the 

feet (D, E) of said arcs. 
Mounting apparatus according to any one of claims 4 and 5, 
characterized in that the guide cage contains at least 

one wire (10, 11) parallel to the strings (6) and serving 
as a guide rail for a sliding carriage (12), said  

 
carriage being fixed at an intermediate point of the 

traction cable (9) and being disposed in such a manner 
that the heads of the strands (4) to be installed are 

easily attachable thereto in removable manner. 
Mounting apparatus according to claim 6, characterized 
in that the carriage (12) has two rigid tubular lengths 

(15) on either side thereof, the lengths having two 
respective guide wires (10, 11) passing therethrough, 

which wires are contained inside the cage. 
Mounting apparatus according to any one of claims 6 and 7, 
characterized in that the above or "main" carriage (12) 

is associated with an auxiliary carriage (20) which is 
fixed in easily removable manner to an intermediate point 

of the traction cable (9) disposed a little higher than 
the main carriage, which auxiliary carriage is also 

mounted to slide on each of the guide wires (10, 11) and 
is organized in such a manner that the heads of the 

strands (4) to be installed are easily fastenable thereto 
in removable manner. 
Mounting apparatus according to any one of claims 6 to 8, 
characterized in that each carriage (12, 20) is 

organized in such a manner that the heads of two strands 
(4) to be installed are easily fastenable thereto in 

removable manner. 
Mounting apparatus according to any one of claims 4 to 9,
 
   characterized in that the distance between 

successive hoops (5) of the cage lies in the range 5 
meters to 10 meters.
