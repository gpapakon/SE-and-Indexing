<ABSTRACT>
A method for decoloring a recombinant human serum 
albumin by treating the albumin with a reducing agent is 

disclosed. Also, a method for decoloring a recombinant human 
serum albumin by treating the albumin with a method removing 

free polysaccharides with a cation exchanger followed by heat 
treatment is disclosed. 
The present invention provides a recombinant human 
serum albumin, coloring of which is fully suppressed by 

preventing binding of certain coloring components, which are 
contained in the raw materials or contaminants secreted by a 

microorganism, to human serum albumin so as not to cause 
coloring of the human serum albumin.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for decoloring
recombinant human serum albumin obtained by gene manipulation
techniques.Albumin, especially human serum albumin (HSA), is an
important protein of the circulatory system. The protein is
produced in the liver and has a major role in maintaining
normal osmotic pressure of body fluids, such as blood. It
also serves as a carrier of various molecules.HSA is administered under various clinical
conditions. For example, in the case of shock or burn
injury, it is necessary, in general, to administer HSA
frequently to restore blood volume and to alleviate other
injury-related symptoms. Patients suffering from
hypoproteinemia and fetal erythroblastosis sometimes require
HSA treatment. In other words, a common indication for HSA
administration is a loss of body fluids, such as during a
surgical procedure, shock, burn injury or hypoproteinemia
which causes edema.Currently, HSA is produced mainly as a fractionated
product of collected blood. Such a production process,
however, has disadvantages in that it is not economical and
the supply of blood is sporadic. In addition, collected
blood sometimes contains undesirable substances, such as 
hepatitis virus. In consequence, it is profitable to develop
a material which can be used as a substitute for HSA obtained
from collected blood.Recent advances in recombinant DNA techniques have
rendered possible microbial production of various types of
useful polypeptides, and, as a result, a number of mammalian
polypeptides have been produced in various microorganisms.
With regard to HSA, establishing techniques for the large
scale production of HSA by recombinant methods and subsequent
high grade purification is in progress.However, in the case of producing HSA by means of
gene manipulation techniques, it is highly probable that an
HSA preparation of interest will be contaminated by certain
coloring components, which are contained in the raw materials
or secreted by a microorganism during culturing of the host
microorganism or are introduced during purification of the
resulting HSA, and that these contaminants bind to HSA to
cause coloring of the HSA itself. What is more, such
contaminants cannot be removed sufficiently by means of any
prior art process for the purification of plasma-derived HSA.An object of the instant invention is to provide
human serum albumin obtained by means of gene manipulation
techniques, coloring of which can be sufficiently suppressed
by removing the above-described coloring components and
contaminants
