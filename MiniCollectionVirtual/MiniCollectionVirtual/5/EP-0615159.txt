<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a silver halide photographic
material, and more particularly to a silver halide
photographic material having an excellent stability giving less
deviation of performance at the production thereof. Also, the
invention relates to a silver halide photographic material
having an excellent processing stability giving less formation
of streaks and giving less depositions in processing liquids in
continuous processing in a market.Color photographs which have been widely popularized at
present have progressed to the extent that they can be obtained
more quickly and easily in any places by the progress of the
light-sensitive materials themselves and the photographic
processing techniques. In particular, in the field of color
prints, the production of color prints has been practiced
according to various purposes by the development of a
concentrated processing system called color laboratory by a
production place where high-speed printers, large-scale
photographic processors, etc., for mass production are disposed
and a dispersed processing system using small-sized printer
processors each called "mini-labo." or a miniature laboratory
disposed in each store. Recently, by the practical use of a
photographic light-sensitive material using a high silver
chloride emulsion and the processing process disclosed in PCT 
WO 87/04534, photographic processing is more and more
quickened.Simultaneously with such an investigation of quickening
photographic processing, the improvement of the stability of
the image quality of prints obtained has always been required
for increasing the production efficiency of color prints.For the purpose, the stabilized performance of color
photographic papers being used for producing color prints is
important.Considering the actual circumstances of the markets of
color prints as described above, the requirement for the
performance stability of color photographic papers has been
more increased.
That is, in the large laboratory making a mass production of
color prints, if the performance of each color photographic
paper is stabilized, color prints can be produced by
enstablishing the printing condition of a high-speed printer at
constant, whereby the effincency is greatly increased. Also,
in the production of color prints using a "mini-labo." disposed
in a store, etc., it is frequently difficult to obtain a
skilled operator and hence the stabilized perforance of color
photographic papers directly relates to the improvement of the
quality and the yield of the color
