<ABSTRACT>
A stapler for driving staples into a sheaf of papers comprises a base (11) and a stapler head (12) pivotably connected to the base via a first pin (13) and pivotable between a starting position and a working position in which it is applied against a sheaf of papers placed between the base and the stapler head. A reciprocating drive element (21), adapted to drive a staple into the sheaf of papers during a driving stroke, is arranged in the stapler head. A drive mechanism (15), adapted to reciprocate the drive element (21), is pivotably connected to the stapler head (12) via a second pin (16) parallel to the first pin (13). A drive means (22-26) is arranged in the base (11) for pivoting the stapler head (12) and the drive mechanism (15). A locking mechanism (36-41) is arranged in the stapler head (12) for releasably locking the latter in the working position while a staple is being driven into the sheaf of papers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a stapler for driving 
staples into an object, such as a sheaf of papers, 
said stapler comprising a base, a stapler head pivotably 
connected to the base via a first pin and pivotable 
between a starting position and a working position in 
which 
the stapler head 
is applied against said object when the object is placed 
in the stapler between the base and the stapler head, 
a reciprocating drive element disposed in the stapler head 
and adapted to drive a staple into said object during a 
driving stroke, an operating means which is pivotable 
about a second pin parallel to the first pin and which 
is adapted to reciprocate the drive element, and a drive 
means adapted to pivot the stapler head and the operating 
means. A prior-art stapler of this type is schematically 
illustrated in Fig. 1 of the accompanying drawings. The illustrated stapler, which is adapted for driving 
staples into a sheaf of papers, comprises a base 1 
and a stapler head 2 pivotably connected thereto. The 
stapler head 2 is pivotable about a pin 3, fixedly connected 
to the base 1, between an upper starting position 
(see Fig. 1) and a working position in which it is applied 
against a sheaf of papers 4 placed in the stapler between 
the base 1 and the stapler head 2 and which thus depends 
on the thickness of the sheaf of papers 4. An operating means in the form of a pivotable arm 5 
is arranged in the stapler head 2. The arm 5 is pivotable 
about a pin 6 which is parallel to the pin 3 and, like 
the latter, connected to the base 1. A reciprocating drive 
element 7, which is arranged in the stapler head 2 in 
order, during a driving stroke, to expel a staple from a 
staple magazine 8 arranged in the stapler head 2 and drive 
the staple into the sheaf of papers 4, is reciprocated by 
means of the arm 5. To this end, the arm 5 is pivotable 
between an upper starting position (see Fig. 1) and a  
 
lower position in which it is so placed that the drive 
element 7 has reached the base 1 or, to be more precise, 
is at a distance from the base 1 that equals the thickness 
of two sheets of paper, i.e. the thinnest imaginable sheaf 
to be stapled. The arm 5 is pivoted by a motor-driven 
eccentric device. The arm 5 is connected to the stapler head 2 by a 
spring 9. When the arm 5 is pivoted downwards from the 
starting position, it entrains, owing to the spring 9, the 
stapler head 2 until this is applied against the sheaf of 
papers 4 which, in the example shown in Fig. 1, is much 
thicker than the

A stapler for driving staples into an object (14), 
such as a sheaf of papers, said stapler comprising a base 

(11), a stapler head (12) pivotably connected to the base 
via a first pin (13) and pivotable between a starting 

position and a working position in which 
the stapler head 

is applied 
against said object when the object is placed in the stapler 

between the base and the stapler head, a reciprocating 
drive element (21) disposed in the stapler head (12) and 

adapted to drive a staple into said object (14), an operating 
means (15) which is pivotable about a second pin 

(16) parallel to the first pin (13) and which is adapted 
to reciprocate the drive element (21), and a drive means 

(22-26) adapted to pivot the stapler head (12) and the 
operating means (15), 
characterised
 in that 
the operating means (15) is pivotably connected to the 

stapler head (12) via the second pin (16), and that a 
locking mechanism (36-41) is provided to releasably lock 

the stapler head (12) in the working position while a 
staple is being driven into said object. 
A stapler as set forth in claim 1, 
characterised
 
in that the locking mechanism (36-41) has 

a locking plate (36) which is pivotably connected to the 
stapler head (12) via a third pin (37) parallel to said 

first and second pins 
(13, 16) and which has an arcuate slot (38) which 

engages a locking pin (39) which is fixedly connected to 
the base (11) and parallel to said 

first, second and third 
pins (13, 16, 37). 
A stapler as set forth in claim 2, 
characterised
 
in that the locking plate (36) is pivotable 

between a first position, in which the locking pin (39) is 
located in a first end portion of the arcuate slot (38), 

and a second position, in which the locking pin (39) is 
located in a second end portion of the arcuate slot (38) 

and towards which the locking plate (36) is biased by a 
spring (41), said arcuate slot (38) having, with respect  

 
to the third pin (37), a radius of curvature increasing 

in the direction away from the first end portion towards 
the second end portion, said third pin (37) being so positioned 

in relation to the first pin (13) that, when the 
spring (41) pivots the locking plate (36) from the first 

position to the second position and the distance of the 
third pin (37) to the locking pin (39) fixedly connected 

to the base (11) thus increases as a result of the 
increase of the radius of curvature of the slot (38), the third pin 

moves the stapler head (12) to the working position in 
which 

the stapler head 
is locked by a wedge action between a wall of 

the slot (38) and the locking pin (39). 
A stapler as set forth in any one of claims 1-3, 

characterised
 in that the drive means (22-26) 
has a motor-driven driving gear wheel (25) whose axis 

coincides with that of the first pin (13), and a cam 
mechanism (26) which is rotatably mounted on the stapler 

head (12) via a fourth pin (27) parallel to said 
first, second and third 

pins (13, 
16, 37), and meshes, via a gear wheel (28), with the driving 

gear wheel (25) to be driven thereby, 
said cam mechanism having 

a first cam 
means (32) adapted to cooperate with the operating means 

(15) so as to pivot, when the cam mechanism (26) is 
rotated, the operating means to and fro about the second 

pin (16), thereby reciprocating the drive element (21). 
A stapler as set forth in claims 3 and 4, 

characterised
 in that the cam mechanism (26) 
has a second cam means (35) adapted to cooperate with the 

locking plate (36) in order, when the cam mechanism (26) 
is in a starting position, to retain the locking plate 

(36) in its first position; in order, when the cam mechanism 
(26) in the initial phase of a revolution is rotated 

away from its starting position, to release the locking 
plate (36) so that 

the locking plate 
is pivoted to its second position by 

the spring (41); and in order, when the cam mechanism (26) 
in the final phase of said revolution returns to its 

starting position, to return the locking plate (36) to its 
first position against the action of the spring (41), said  

 
first and second cam means (32 and 35, respectively) being 

so synchronised that the operating means (15), as well as 
the locking plate (36), performs a pivotal cycle during 

one revolution of the cam mechanism (26) and that the operating 
means (15) imparts a driving stroke to the drive 

element (21) when the second cam means (35) has released 
the locking plate (36) and this is in its second position, 

thereby locking the stapler head (12) in the working position.
