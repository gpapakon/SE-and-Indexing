<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a recording medium 
suitable for use in recording using water-based inks, an 
ink-jet recording method using such a recording medium and 
a print obtained thereby. In particular, this invention 
relates to a recording medium which can provide images 
high in optical density and resolution and bright in color 
tone, has excellent ink-absorbing capacity, causes no 
change in tint, and is good in color reproducibility and 
high in gloss, an ink-jet recording method using such a 
recording medium and a print obtained thereby. The present invention also relates to a dispersion, 
which is suitable for use in production of the recording 
medium, and a production process of the recording medium 
using such a dispersion. In recent years, an ink-jet recording system, in 
which minute droplets of an ink are flown by any one of 
various working principles to apply them to a recording 
medium such as paper, thereby make a record of images,  
 
characters and/or the like, has been quickly spread as a 
recording apparatus for various images in various 
applications including information instruments because it 
has features that recording can be conducted at high speed 
and with a low noise, color images can be formed with 
ease, recording patterns are very flexible, and 
development and fixing process are unnecessary. Further, 
it begins to be applied to a field of recording of full-color 
images because images formed by a multi-color ink-jet 
recording system are comparable in quality with multi-color 
prints by a plate making system and photoprints by a 
color photographic system, and such records can be 
obtained at lower cost than the usual multi-color prints 
and photoprints when the number of copies is small. With 
the improvement in recordability, such as speeding up and 
high definition of recording, and full-coloring of images, 
recording apparatus and recording methods have been 
improved, and recording media have also been required to 
have higher properties. In order to satisfy such requirements, a wide 
variety of recording media have heretofore been proposed. 
For example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 52-53012 
discloses paper for ink-jet, in which a base paper 
web low in sizing degree is impregnated with a surface 
coating. Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 53-49113 
discloses paper for ink-jet, in which a sheet  
 
containing urea-formalin resin powder therein is 
impregnated with a water-soluble polymer. Japanese Patent 
Application Laid-Open No.
