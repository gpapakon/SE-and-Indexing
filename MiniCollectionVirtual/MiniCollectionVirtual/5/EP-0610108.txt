<ABSTRACT>
Crimping ring constituted by a portion of metal band, wound on itself, the two ends of which are connected together without causing the appearance of an appreciable additional thickness in the connection area. The ends of the band (1) are arranged substantially in contact with each other along their terminal edge (4a, 5a), the thickness of each of the said ends being approximately half the thickness of the band. Their internal face is offset towards the outside with respect to the internal surface of the ring so as to constitute a housing (11) for a plate (8), the thickness of which is approximately half that of the band. A set of studs (6, 7) and of complementary holes (9, 10) is provided on the ends of the band and on the plate, the said studs being engaged in the holes and their free end being riveted onto the element opposite the one which bears them.

<CLAIMS>
Ring for swaging constituted by a length of rolled-up metal strip 
(1), the two ends (2, 3) of the strip being bonded together without causing 

significant increased thickness in the bond zone, characterized in that the 
ends (2, 3) of the length (1) of strip are disposed substantially in contact 

with each other via their terminal edges (4a, 5a), the thickness of each of 
said ends (2, 3) being close to half the thickness of the strip (1) and their 

inside or outside face (4, 5) being offset outwardly or inwardly relative to the 
inside or outside surface of the ring so as to constitute a housing (11) for a 

plate (8) of thickness close to half the thickness of the strip (1), while a set 
of complementary studs (6, 7) and holes (9, 10) is provided on the ends (2, 

3) of the strip (1) and on the plate (8), said studs (6, 7) being engaged in the 
holes (9, 10), and their free ends being riveted to the element, plate (8) or 

end of the strip (2, 3) opposite from the element that carries them. 
Ring for swaging according to claim 1, characterized in that it 
comprises a set of at least two studs (6, 7) or holes disposed on each of the 

ends (2, 3) of the strip (1), and a set of at least four holes (9, 10) or studs 
correspondingly disposed on the plate (8). 
Ring for swaging according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
plate (8) is made of a material having greater mechanical strength than the 

material of the strip (1). 
Ring for swaging according to any one of of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that at least one of the terminal edges (8a) of the 

plate (8) has a profile that is not rectilinear, and in that the corresponding 
end (4b, 5b) of the housing (11) has a profile that is complementary. 
Method of manufacturing a ring for swaging according to any one 
of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that, in a continuous metal strip (21), the 

two opposite ends (22, 23) of two rings are formed simultaneously by 
pressing and/or stamping, thereby giving them a thickness close to half the 

thickness of the strip (21), and causing at least one hole or at least one stud 
to appear in each of them, and in that the extreme terminal edges in the 

axial direction of said ends are then simultaneously cut out (21). 
Method according to claim 5, characterized in that the metal 
displaced from the side edges of the ends of two rings is removed, e.g. by 

being cut off, so as to make the width of the ends substantially equal to the 
width of the strip (21).
