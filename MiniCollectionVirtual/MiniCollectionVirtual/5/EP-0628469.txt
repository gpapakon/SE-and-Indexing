<ABSTRACT>
Skeleton frame comprising vertical side-wall pillars and a floor panel arranged horizontally between the side-wall pillars (14), or a floor panel and inner roof part. The floor panel and the inner roof part are offset laterally with respect to the side-wall pillars and are held by means of brackets (13) which are fastened on the one hand to the side-wall pillars and on the other hand to edge regions of the floor panel and the inner roof part. The floor panel and inner roof part are, for example, multi-layered composite panels. The skeleton frame can be used, for example as a box body for road vehicles.

<CLAIMS>
Framework structure for a vehicle body, comprising vertical side-wall columns (14)
and a floor panel (11) arranged horizontally and laterally offset relative to the side-wall

columns (14), in which the floor panel (11) is held by means of brackets (31)
associated with the side-wall columns (14) and secured, on the one hand, to the

side-wall columns (14) and, on the other hand, to edge regions of the floor panel
(11), characterised in that a plurality of brackets (31) are arranged at a distance

from one another along each side wall on either side of the vehicle body, thereby
forming intermediate spaces, and that the floor panel (11) is self-supporting between

the brackets (31).
Framework structure according to claim 1 characterised in that the floor panel (11)
is arranged at the lower end of the vertical side-wall columns (14) by means of

brackets (31).
Framework structure according to claim 1 or claim 2, characterised in that a roof
construction comprises an internal roof part (28) which is laterally offset relative to

the side-wall columns (14) and is held by means of roof brackets (29) associated
with each side wall (14) and secured, on the one hand, to the side-wall columns (14)

and, on the other hand, to edge regions of the internal roof part (29).
Framework structure according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the
floor panel (11) is a multi-layer composite panel.
Framework structure according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the
floor panel (11) has open profiles (30) at its edges.
Framework structure according to claims 1 and 3, characterised in that the floor
panel (11) and the internal roof part (26) are one-part multi-layer composite panels

which extend over the entire region between the vertical side-wall columns (14).
Framework structure according to claims 1 and 3, characterised in that the floor
panel (11) is arranged at the lower end of the vertical side-wall columns (14) as a

one-piece composite panel and the internal roof part (28) is arranged in the region 
of the upper ends of the vertical side-wall columns (14) as a one-piece composite

panel.
Framework structure according to claim 1, characterised in that the brackets (31)
are secured to at least one end face of each side-wall column (14) by means of a

tongue or a bulb which engages in a groove in the side-wall column, and a
horizontally extending tongue, bulb, double tongue or double bulb (45) is provided

on a lower, inwardly directed side of the bracket (31) and engages in the edge
profile (30) on the floor panel (11) by means of a corresponding single or double

groove (53).
