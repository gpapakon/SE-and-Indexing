<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a method and kit for the detection of antibodies in seronegative individuals. The method and kit are especially useful for the detection of HIV specific antibodies in whole blood from individuals who have been infected with the HIV virus but are seronegative. The method and kit minimize contact by health personnel with HIV infected blood.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved method for detecting
antibodies in whole blood of individuals who test seronegative by
conventional assay techniques. A kit for detecting antibodies in whole
blood of individuals who test seronegative by conventional assay
techniques is also disclosed. More particularly, the present invention
relates to an assay for detecting possible retrovirus infection, such as
infection by the HIV virus, which utilizes a mitogen in whole blood to
stimulate antibody production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells. An
improved assay kit which does not require the separation of peripheral
blood mononuclear cells from whole blood prior to culture with pokeweed
mitogen is also disclosed.As used herein, mitogen means any substance capable of activating B-cells
and/or T-cells. The term "whole blood" means blood collected with
heparin, EDTA, or any other substance that prevents coagulation and
clotting. The term whole blood as used herein also includes blood collected
from and animal or human with heparin, ethylenediaminetetraacetate, or
any other substance that prevents coagulation and clotting. "Whole blood"
can also mean blood wherein the red blood cells have been lysed while
maintaining the viability of the remaining white blood cells. Serological detection of antibodies against a
variety of infectious disease agents is considered evidence of
exposure to and/or active infection by the agent. Serological
detection of antibodies could also be useful for early detection
of cancer and for predicting the success of organ or tissue
transplants. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
commercial kits are commonly used as screening tests for
serological detection of antibodies. The western blot
technique has been the method most widely used to confirm
ELISA-reactive serum samples, although other methods such
as immunofluorescence, may also be applicable. Polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) technique may also be used to confirm
results of a preliminary assay.
As part of standard ELISA procedure, test serumis incubated with specific antigens that are immobilized on
beads or wells. Non-specific antibody in the serum is removed
by washing, but the antibodies with affinity for the antigens
present in the system remain bound. When the appropriate
developing reagents are added, spectrophotometrically
detectable color is produced, the optical density of which is
proportional to the amount of antibodies bound. The standard
optical density is established by the manufacturer of the
ELISA kit and

<CLAIMS>
A method for the detection of antibodies directed against a virus in a
sample comprising the following steps :


a) obtaining a whole blood sample;
b) incubating the whole blood sample in a culture containing a mitogen to
induce polyclonal activation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and

the expression of virus specific antibodies; and
c) determining the presence of the virus specific antibodies.
