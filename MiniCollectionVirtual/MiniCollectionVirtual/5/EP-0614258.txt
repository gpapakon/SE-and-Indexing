<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for producing a plastic cable guiding channel 1 for receiving lines, in particular electric lines in a motor vehicle, having an insertion and removal opening, extending in the longitudinal direction, in the form of a continuous slit. In this method, the cable guiding channel 1 is produced in a closed form by applying the blow-moulding technique and the continuous slit is formed.

<CLAIMS>
Method for producing a plastic cable guiding 
channel (1) for receiving lines, in particular electrical 

lines in a motor vehicle, having a longitudinally extending 
leading-in and leading-out opening in the form of a 

continuous slit (6), characterized in that the cable 
guiding channel is moulded in a closed mould by using the 

blow-moulding technique and the continuous slit (6) is 
formed by cutting open along the side. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the producing of the slit (6) is integrated into the 

operation of producing the cable guiding channel (1). 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that fastening flanges (7) are moulded 

onto the cable guiding channel (1), arranged at 
longitudinal intervals from one another. 
Cable guiding channel produced by the method 
according to Claim 1, characterized in that this channel 

(1) produced by the blow-moulding technique and provided 
with a slit (6) has fastening flanges (7) at least on one 

side. 
Cable guiding channel according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that the said channel has at least one 

undercut region (9).
