<DESCRIPTION>
 BIOLOGICALLY ACTIVE PEPTIDES HAVING N-TERMNΔL SUBSTITUTIONSThis invention relates to biologically active peptides. More particularly, this invention relates to biologically active peptides having N-terminal (or amino-terminal) substitutions.In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, there is provided an N-terminal substituted peptide or protein having the formula: WI IT - N - X, wherein X is a biologically active peptide or protein. The peptide or protein is preferably an ion channel-forming peptide or protein. T is a lipophilic moiety, and W is T or hydrogen.The term "lipophilic," as used herein, means that the lipophilic moiety enhances the interaction of the peptide or protein with a lipid membrane, such as, for example, a cell membrane.Lipophilic moieties which may be employed, include, but are not limited to, any moiety which may be placed on the N-terminal of the peptide through a condensation reaction with nitrogen. The lipophilic moiety T may be, for example, a carboxylic acid, a phosphoric acid, preferably an alkylphosphoric acid, a phosphonic acid,-1-SUBSTITUTESHEET 

preferably an alkylphosphonic acid, a sulfonic acid, preferably an alkylsulfonic acid, or an alkyl group . Preferably, T is : 0I IR - C -, wherein R is a hydrocarbon having at least two and no more than 16 carbon atoms.In one embodiment, R is an alkyl group. The alkyl group may be a straight chain or branched chain alkyl group; or a cycloalkyl group. For example, R may be CH„(CH2) -, wherein n is from 1 to 14. Preferably, n is from 4 to 9, and most preferably n is 6, whereby T is an octanoyl group.In another embodiment, R is an aromatic (including phenyl and naphthyl), or an alkyl aromatic group. For example, R may be 0 -(CH-) -, wherein z is from 0 to 6.Preferably, z is 1 or 2.In one embodiment, W is hydrogen.Applicant has found, that when biologically active peptides have substitutions at the N-terminal such as those hereinabove described, such peptides have increased biological activity against target cells, viruses, and virally-infected cells, as compared with unsubstituted peptides or peptides substituted at the N-terminal with an acetyl group. Applicant also has found that the N-terminal substitutions hereinabove described significantly increase the biological activity of "short"-2-SUBSTITUTESHEET 

peptides, i.e. peptides having no more than 14 amino acid residues.As hereinabove stated, the biologically active peptides or proteins of the present invention are preferably ion channel-forming peptides. An ion
