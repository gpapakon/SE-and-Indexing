<ABSTRACT>
The invention belongs to physics sphere and can 
be used in the control equipment for temperature 

measurement and also in temperature-sensitive 
resistor production itself. 
The problem, which is solved by the applied 
invention is the creation of a film 

temperature-sensitive resistor which provides the 
accuracy of the results, the high speed of response, 

the stability and the reliability, and also the 
creation of its production process allowing for 

"spare" regimes concerning the transducer elements. 
Temperature-sensitive resistor containts the 
dielectric substrate 1, the film sensing element 2 in 

a meander form with the contact outputs 3 and 4 and 
the protective dielectric coating 5. The sensing 

element 2 is freely spaced in a groove 6 of a 
dielectric substrate 1 without any interaction with 

the walls. The tight cavity 7, formed by the groove 6 
and the coating 5 is filled by an inert gas. 
In production of the temperature-sensitive 
resistor the groove 6 first is fulfilled in a 

dielectric substrate 1, next the sensing element 2 is 
spaced in it and the protective dielectric coating 5 

is applied with a simultaneous packing of a formed 
tight cavity 7 with an inert gas.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention belongs to physics sphere and can 
be used in the control equipment for temperature 
measurement, and in temperature-sensitive resistor 
production itself as well. From the existing level of technique the 
wire-wound temperature-sensitive resistors are known, 
of which the most precise consist in bifilar helix 
made of a pure platinic wire anchored to the 
quartz-core or dropped in a quartz-tube. The helix is 
suspended in an inert gas atmosphere and is in contact 
with the core structure at a minimum number of points. 
The mechanical stresses under its deformation during 
the process of measurements, because of the difference 
in thermal-expansion coefficients (TEC) of resistance 
element and core structure materials, are reduced to 
a minimum ("Les Capteurs en Instrumentation 
Industrielle" par Georges Asch, Ingénieur E.S.E., 
Professeur à l'université Lyon I avec la 
collaboration, BORDAS, Paris,1991). [1] As for production process of such temperature-sensitive 
resistors [1], it is sufficiently 
traditional and represents the sequence of 
mechanical assignments for manufacture of temperature-sensitive 
resistor individual elements and for their 
assembly into a complete package. The mostly close technical decision, taken as a 
prototype of a temperature-sensitive resistor is the 
platinic film temperature-sensitive resistor, 
containing the flat ceramic substrate, to which the 
platinic film sensing element in a meander form with 
the contact outputs is applied. The sensing element 
and the ceramic substrate as well are overlayed with a  
 
protective ceramic coating to protect an active 
platinic layer against damage and influence of an 
outside atmosphere (Franzis Elektronic-Fachbuch, 
Gerhard Weigleb "Sensortechnik. Übersicht, 
Applikation, Anwendungen",1986, Franzis-Verlag GmbH, 
München) [2]. The production process of temperature-sensitive 
resistors presented in a cited book [2] is taken as a 
progenitor of temperature - sensitive resistor 
production process. The platinic layer ∼ 2µm thick is 
applied to a ceramic substrate by spraying. An 
ornament in a meander form is "burnt out" by lazer in 
a sprayed layer and next a delicate finishing is 
carried out. Thereupon the sensing element contact 
outputs are manufactured by the thermocompressing 
welding method. An active platinic layer and the 
ceramic substrate as well are overlayed with a 
protective ceramic coating ∼ 10µm thick to protect 
them against damage and influence of an outside 
atmosphere. An appraisal of the

Temperature-sensitive resistor, containing the 
dielectric substrate 1 with the film sensing 

element 2 in meander form placed on it, which has 
the contact outputs 3 and 4, and with the 

protective dielectric coating 5 sputtered above 
onto the ceramic substrate 1 and onto the sensing 

element 2, differs in that the groove 6 for the 
sensing element 2 registering with the last 

mentioned in a meander shape in plan is fulfilled 
in a dielectric substrate 1, the groove width and 

depth are fulfilled exceeding the cross section 
width and depth of any section of a sensing element 

2, in this case the sensing element 2 itself is 
located in the groove 6 of a dielectric substrate 1 

without any interaction with its walls and bottom 
and also without interaction with the protective 

dielectric coating 5 sputtered above onto the 

dielectric substrate 1 with the formation of a 
tight cavity 7 between itself and the groove 6 in a 

meander form, the sensing element 2 is spaced in a 
tight cavity, which is filled with an inert gas. 
Temperature-sensitive resistor according to the 1st 
point differs in that the thickness of a sensing 

element 2 cross section is fulfilled exceeding the 
electron distance of free travel in metal more than 

a 100 times. 
Temperature-sensitive resistor according to the 1st 
point differs in that the sensing element 2 is 

fulfilled of a pure metal. 
Temperature-sensitive resistor according to the 1st 
point differs in that the dielectric substrate 1 

and the protective dielectric coating 5 are 
manufactured of the same or of different materials. 
Temperature-sensitive resistor according to the 3rd 
point differs in that the metal purity of a sensing 

element 2 is chosen equal to 99,95÷99,99%. 
The production process of temperature-sensitive 
resistor implying that the sensing element 2 in a 

meander form is located on a dielectric substrate 1 
and next the protective dielectric coating 5 is 

sputtered above onto the dielectric substrate 1 and 
onto the sensing element 1 differs in that the 

groove 6 in a meander form in plan is fulfilled in 
a dielectric substrate 1 for a sensing element 2 of 

a similar configuration, associating the sensing 
element 2 and yet with the width and depth 

exceeding the sensing element 2 cross section 
width and depth, the sensing element 2 is spaced in 

a meander form groove 6 without interaction of the 
element with the walls and the bottom of the groove 

6, the protective dielectric coating is sputtered 
above with the formation of a tight cavity 7 

between the coating, the walls and the bottom of a 
meander-shaped groove 6 where the sensing element 2 

is located with a simultaneous filling it with an 
inert gas and with an exclusion of an interaction 

between the sensing element 2 and the protective 
dielectric coating 5.
