<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink-jet 
recording method which enables formation of an image 
with high optical density and high resolution, 
particularly to an ink-jet recording method which 
enables recording of an image excellent in light-transmissivity 
or surface gloss. The present invention also relates to a color 
image-forming method employing the above recording 
method. Various recording mediums are used for ink-jet 
recording, including coated-paper sheets, glossy-paper 
sheets, OHP-recording films (recording films for 
overhead projectors), etc. An example of the coated 
paper is the one disclosed in Japanese Patent 
Publication No. 3-26665 which comprises a base paper 
sheet, and a coating layer thereon composed of fine 
powdery silica and a water-soluble binder such as 
polyvinyl alcohol. An example of the glossy paper is 
the one disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 3-25352 
which comprises a cast-coated paper sheet, and a 
surface layer composed of polyvinyl alcohol of a  
 
saponification degree of 50 to 90 mol% and a 
crosslinking agent. An example of the OHP-recording 
sheets is the one which is disclosed by Japanese Patent 
Application Laid-Open No. 60-220750 comprising a 
polyester film and a hydrophilic surface layer thereon 
composed of a water-soluble polyvinyl alcohol of a 
saponification degree of 70 to 90 mol%. With improvements in performance of ink-jet 
recording apparatuses in recording speed, multiple 
color recording and so forth, the recording medium 
therefor is required to be improved to have the 
properties below simultaneously: 
(1) The recording medium has higher ink-absorbency (a 
larger ink absorption capacity, and quicker ink 
absorption). (2) The recorded dots on the recording medium have 
high optical density with distinct circumference. (3) The recorded dots on the recording medium have a 
shape approximate to a true circle with smooth 
circumference. (4) The recording medium changes little its properties 
and does not curl with changes of temperature and 
humidity. (5) The recording medium does not cause blocking. 
Further, the recording medium is required to have 
storability as below: (6) The recorded image is stable and does not  
 
deteriorate in long-term storage (particularly under a 
high temperature and a high humidity). (7) The recording medium itself is stable and does not 
deteriorate in long-term storage (particularly under a 
high temperature and a high humidity). For ink-jet recording of a transparent image 
for OHP or of an image
