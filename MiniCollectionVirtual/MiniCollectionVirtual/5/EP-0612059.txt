Method of estimating transit time, in which transit time differences of noise-disturbed
signals of at least two speech channels are determined by means of a cross-correlation,

characterised thereby

that in the frequency range the phase values of at least two signals are
ascertained by way of a specific number of maxima of the cross power density

and the phase displacement thereof is determined, and
that the required phase equalisation is similarly undertaken in the frequency
range.
Method according to claim 1, characterised thereby that background disturbances
and the transient behaviour of the space are constantly estimated together in the

determination of the phase values.
Method according to claim 2, characterised thereby that the background noise is
estimated by way of a noise monitor and that a new phase value is ascertained merely

when the estimated value of the background noise is exceeded by a specific factor.
Method according to claim 2, characterised thereby that the transient behaviour of
the surrounding space is estimated by way of an impulse monitor in such a manner that a

new phase estimated value is ascertained merely in the case of strong increase in energy
in the signals.
Method according to one of the preceding claims, characterised thereby that a
linear transit time displacement of the signals is adopted.
Method according to one of the preceding claims, characterised thereby that a
smoothing of the phase value is undertaken from the word start in the spoken word and

that the variance of the estimation is taken into consideration in the smoothing of the
phase values.
Method according to one of the preceding claims, characterised thereby that

that at least two microphone signals x,y are transformed into the frequency range
by means of an FFT (Fast Fourier Transform), 
that the estimated values X and,Y and are determined by spectral subtraction from the
transformed signals,
that the amount of the cross power density B
xy
 is determined from the estimated
values X and,Y and,
that the maxima of the cross power density are determined, that an actual value
S
B
 for the disturbed signals is ascertained from a specific number of maxima of
the cross power density B
xy
, and that in dependence on the actual value S
B
 the
phases ϕ of the disturbed signals are ascertained and thus the phase increase

ϕ' is determined,
that the phase increase ϕ' is smoothed, in that by way of an impulse monitor a
simulated speech pulse S
I
 is coupled with the actual value S
B
 of the disturbed
signals in such a manner that a renewed phase estimation is undertaken merely

when a strong increase in energy of the microphone signal is registered, and
that an estimated value S
N
 for the background noise disturbance is ascertained
by a noise monitor and is coupled with the actual value S
B
 of the disturbed
signals in such a manner that a renewed phase estimation is undertaken merely

when the background disturbance is significantly exceeded by the signal.
Method according to claim 7, characterised thereby that a maximum phase
increase |ϕ'|
max
 for the phase of the individual maxima is settable and a renewed phase
estimation is u
ndertaken merely when the phase increase does not exceed the maximum
increase |ϕ'|
max
 by a least M' of the M maxima.
Method according to claim 7, characterised thereby that the variance of the phase
increases of the individual maxima are taken into consideration in the smoothing over time

of the phase increase.
Method according to claims 7 to 9, characterised thereby that a renewed phase
estimation is undertaken merely when the conditions for a valid phase increase occur in

time several times in succession.
Method according to one of the preceding claims, characterised thereby that the
disturbed speech is received on more than two speech channels and that the transit time

differences of the individual channels are estimated.
