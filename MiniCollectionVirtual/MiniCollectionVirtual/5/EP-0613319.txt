<ABSTRACT>
The sound pick up device includes several fixed sensors (101,... 10n,... 10N) in an environment where noise is present originating from one or more locations of origin wich, seen from any one of the sensors, can be regarded as being the same noise originating from a single equivalent fixed source (12), which may be different from one sensor to the other. It comprises means (14-26) for processing the individual signals originating from the various sensors, giving the said signals phase shifts and forming a weighted sum of the phase-shift signals, the phase shifts and the weighting coefficients being such that the contribution of the noise to the weighted sum is approximately zero. This device can be used particularly as an audio conference terminal, the fixed sensors then being microphones and the noise originating from one or more loudspeakers exhibiting coupling with the signal derived from the microphones and replayed at a distant terminal.

environment subjected to acoustic disturbance originating

either from one source, or from a plurality of sources which
are located at known locations and can be considered, as seen

from any one of the sensors, to a single stationary equivalent

the sensors is zero for the noise originating from the
source.
