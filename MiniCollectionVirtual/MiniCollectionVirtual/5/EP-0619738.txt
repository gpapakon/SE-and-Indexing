<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed towards immunoglobulin polypeptides that specifically bind to the extracellular domain of the human type beta PDGF receptor. The binding of the immunoglobulin polypeptides to the receptor inhibits PDGF-induced (or stimulated) receptor activation as indicated by inhibition of receptor phosphorylation and dimerisation, and by inhibition of PDGF-mediated mitogenesis, chemotaxis and migration of cells displaying the human PDGF type beta receptor on the cell surface. Nucleic acids encoding the immunoglobulin polypeptides are also included in the invention. The immunoglobulin polypeptides have diagnostic and therapeutic uses.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the
production and use of immunoglobulin polypeptides that inhibit
PDGF-mediated proliferation of cells displaying the human type
beta platelet derived growth factor receptor.Platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) is a potent
proliferative agent in cells of mesenchymal origin (Antoniades,
H.N. et al. (1979) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 76: 1809-1813;
Bowen-Pope, D.F. and Ross, R. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257:
5161-5171; Heldin, C-H. et al. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258:
10054-10059).PDGF (M.W. 30 KDa) is a disulphide-linked dimer
consisting of 2 homologous chains termed A or B (Johnsson, A.
et al. (1982) Biochim. Biophys. Res. Commun. 104: 66-74).The chains may combine
with chains of the same or the other type, resulting in 3
isoforms AA, BB or AB (Heldin, C-H. et al. (1986) Nature 319:
511-514). The
mitogen PDGF was first identified (Antoniades, H.N. (1979)
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 76: 1809-1813; Raines, E.W. and
Ross, R. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257: 5154-5160)
and purified from human
platelets (Raines, op. cit.), though subsequent research has
shown that several cell types including vascular endothelial
cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, macrophages and even
fibroblasts synthesise PDGF (Ross, R. et al. (1986) Cell 46:
155-169).The cellular proliferation induced by all isoforms of
PDGF is mediated by ligand binding to the PDGF receptor
(Heldin, C-H. (1983) op. cit., Ek, B. et al. (1982) Nature 295: 
419-420; Glenn, K. et al. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257:
5172-5176; Frackelton, A.R. et al. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259:
7909-7915; Williams, L.T. et al. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259:
5287-5294).
The PDGF receptor (M.W. 180 KDa) belongs to the tyrosine kinase
family and consists of two receptor subtypes, termed type A (or
type alpha) (Matsui, T. et al. (1989) Science 243: 800-804, and
Claesson-Welsh, L. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:
4917-4921),
and type B (or type beta) (Yarden, Y. et al. (1986) Nature 323:
226-232, and Escobedo, J.A. et al. (1988) Science 240:
1532-1534).High affinity binding of PDGF to the receptor is
followed by receptor dimerisation (Bishayee, S. et al. (1989)
J. Biol. Chem. 264: 11699-11705, and Heldin, C-H. et al. (1989)
J. Biol. Chem. 264: 8905-8912) and autophosphorylation
(Frackelton, et al. op. cit.), and results in a complicated
series of intracellular signalling events culminating in DNA
synthesis. Mouse and human PDGF beta receptor and PDGF alpha
receptor genes have been cloned (Matsui et al. op. cit.,
Claesson-Welsh et al. op. cit., Yarden et
