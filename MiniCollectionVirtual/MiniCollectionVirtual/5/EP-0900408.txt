<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a rear projection screen of the kind that is illuminated from behind, and that has at the front side lightdispersing material for reception of light beams from an image source with a view to showing the image with a mainly homogeneous luminosity over a wide viewing angle. The lightdispersing elements consist of a number of closely positioned, substantially parallel and in the application position of the screen vertically running lens elements, consisting of one or more triangular, asymmetric lens pairs that create angles with their axes of symmetry, which are different from the normal of the screen, and where each lens (19, 20) has total reflecting inner sides, and where between those one or more lenses (18) have been inserted lenses that are created to transmit light from the light source, and where on the outer side of each lens pair (19 and 20) transmitting lenses are placed, too.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a rear projection screen of the
kind that is illuminated from behind and that has at the
front side lightdispersing mediums for reception of light
beams from a image source with a view to showing a image
with mainly homogeneous luminosity over a wide viewing angle.
The lightdispersing elements consist of a number of
tightly positioned, substantially parallel and in the application
position of the screen vertically running lens
elements, that have two triangular lenses, an intermediate
cylinder lens and a lens adjacent to the triangular lenses.Such projection screens are applied in various devices for
producing a visible image to the viewer, e.g. projection of
radar images, aeroplane simulators, television, traffic
control lights, microfilm readers, video games, video monitors
with projected image and for projection of movies
through rear projection. In such devices a light source,
placed behind the screen, projects light forward along a
projection axis against the screen in preparation for generating,
at the level of the screen, an image which is
spread to all viewers in front of the screen.When a large number of viewers are present they will normally
spread horizontally, and thus it is desirable to have
a broad dispersion of the light horizontally over a wide
angle. This is especially the case with television sets
with a rear projected screen, where there a large number of
viewers sitting in front of the screen at the horizontal
level over a relatively wide angle relative to the screen.One of the problems you have to cope with, in connection
with rear projection systems, is that most of the light is
projected along the projection axis, which means that the
intensity of the image increases, the closer the viewer
sits to the projection axis. Colour video devices with rear
projection screens normally apply three cathode ray tubes, 
that is to say one tube for each of the primary colours,
i.e. red, green, and blue, which tubes project the image to
the screen through their own projection lens. In a conventional
horizontal arrangement of the cathode ray tubes the
green tube is normally positioned centrally on the projection
axis, while the red and the blue cathode ray tube are
placed with their optical axes at an angle of 5 to 10 degrees
with the projection axis of the green tube. Unless
the screen compensates for these displaced positionings, a
phenomenon called colour shifting will occur. This phenomenon
expresses itself through the fact that, if the luminosities

plane of the screen.
