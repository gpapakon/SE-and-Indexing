<ABSTRACT>
A chain for use in transmission and conveyance and with less wear, friction and noise. The central portion 
(151a to 153a) of a pin is in direct engagement with a tooth face of a sprocket, and each pin (151 to 153) is born by a 

rolling bearing (16) provided on one of an inner link plate (306) and an outer link plate (406) and a plain bearing (21) 
provided on the other of the inner link plate (306) and the outer link plate (406). Thus the tooth face of the sprocket 

is brought into rolling contact with a tooth face of the pin, and folding between the adjacent link plates is performed 
in rolling contact. In addition, the chain is made small-sized and light in weight. As friction and wear are generally 

small, power loss is reduced and elongation is slight to keep a high accuracy.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a chain used for
high-accuracy transmission and transportation which
require a low friction and a high wear resistance, and
more particularly, to a chain provided with pins freely
rotatable with respect to link plates.In roller chains and bush chains which have
conventionally been used for transmission and
transportation, pins and bushes are fixed to outside
link plates and inside link plates, respectively. Since
the pins and bushes are in sliding contact with one
another, they are subject to high friction and heavy
wear to cause significant elongation of the chain as
well as power loss. Thus, this type of chain is not
considered to be suitable for such use that requires
high-accuracy positioning. Also, the bushes and rollers
significantly wear and make loud noises by the
engagement of the chain and a sprocket. As one of
countermeasures to reduce friction and wear, there is
known an arrangement such that needle roller bearings
are interposed between the pins and the bushes. In this
arrangement, however, interposition of needle rollers
causes a problem such as decrease of the pin diameter
and reduction of the load-carrying capacity. Some
chains for heavy-load suspension have no bushes.
However, as such pins are directly fitted in link
plates, these chains are extremely disadvantageous in
terms of friction resistance and wear resistance in
transmission or transportation service, and furthermore,
the pins have no tooth face for drive.Examples of prior art chains are provided in
JP-U-52-44579 and FR-A-406741. An embodiment of the present invention may provide
a chain for transmission and transportation with low
friction, high wear resistance, a large load-carrying
capacity and low noise.A conventionally used triple structure at pin-bush-roller
structure is replaced with a structure in
which pins can rotate with low friction with respect to
all link plates connecting the adjacent pins. Rolling
bearings are suitable as bearings for this structure,
and plain bearings are also used, preferably but not
essentially if pins of large diameter are adopted.According to the present invention there is
provided a chain comprising: a plurality of pins
arranged parallel to one another at regular intervals;
first link plates for connecting each of two adjacent
pins among said plurality of pins; second link plates
for connecting each of two adjacent pins not connected
by means of said first link plates, among said
plurality of pins; the chain being characterised by:
at least one rolling
