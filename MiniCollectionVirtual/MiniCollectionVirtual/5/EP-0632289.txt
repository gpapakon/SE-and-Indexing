<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a search and rescue radar 
transponder easy in maintenance and checking. In the search 

and rescue radar transponder of the invention, the 
transmission electric power of the transmitting circuit 3 

leaked at the changeover switch 7 is inputted to the 
receiving circuit 2, and whether the search and rescue radar 

transponder operates normally or not is judged by comparing 
the leaked electric power level detected by the receiving 

circuit 2 with a prescribed level at the controlling circuit 
4. Hereby, the operation-checking of the search and rescue 

radar transponder proper other than an antenna can be execute 
by a built-in apparatus, and its maintenance and checking can 

be executed easily and rapidly.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a search and rescue radar
transponder (hereinafter referred to as "ART" in short) to
receive transmitted signals from rescue radars (hereinafter
referred to as "radars" in short) and to transmit rescue
signals for informing the radars of its location.Fig. 1 is a block diagram showing a structure of a prior
art SART. In Fig. 1, reference numeral 1a designates an
antenna for receiving radar signals (hereinafter referred to
as "receiving antenna"); numeral 1b designates an antenna
for transmitting rescue signals (hereinafter referred to as
"transmitting antenna"); numeral 2 designates a receiving
circuit to amplify and detect the radar signals received by
the receiving antenna 1a; numeral 3 designates a transmitting
circuit to generate rescue signals and output them to the
transmitting antenna 1b; numeral 4 designates a controlling
circuit to control the operation of the transmitting circuit
3 and the receiving circuit 2; numeral 5 designates an
operating switch for operating this SART; and numeral 6
designates a power source to supply electric power to the
receiving circuit 2, the transmitting circuit 3 and the
controlling circuit 4.Fig. 2 is a block diagram showing a structure of another 
prior art SART having an antenna for transmitting and
receiving, which is commonly used as the transmitting antenna
1b and the receiving antenna 1a of Fig. 1. In Fig. 2,
reference numeral 1 designates that antenna; and numeral 7
designates a changeover switch to change over the connection
of the transmitting circuit 3 and the receiving circuit 2 to
the antenna 1.Next, the operation of the prior art SART will be
described. SARTs operate in order to display their own
locations on radar faceplates by receiving transmitted
signals from the radars and transmitting specified rescue
electric waves within receivable periods of the radars at the
time of disasters. For this reason, the SARTs are begun to be
used in large quantities as effective equipment, being
all-weather and 24 hour type lifesaving appliances which are
not influenced by the weather and time zones, for saving
lives precisely and quickly.Since the SARTs shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 differ only in
the point of using the antenna 1 in common or not, the
description of their operation on the basis of the timing
chart of Fig. 3 will be done only about that of the SART shown
in Fig. 2, and the description of the operation of the SART
shown in Fig. 1 will be omitted.Although the SART is in its nonoperating state usually,
electric power is
