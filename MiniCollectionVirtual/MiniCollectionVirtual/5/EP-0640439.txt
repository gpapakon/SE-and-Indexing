<ABSTRACT>
For the simple and safe surface treatment of large, free-standing and essentially horizontal surfaces of objects, especially ships, a lazy-tongs device (13, 18, 28) with a three-dimensionally movable spring/joint device (12.1, 12.2, 19, 29) located thereabove is arranged between an undercarriage (20) and an abrasive blasting capsule (22). Since the abrasive blasting capsule (22) is arranged movably and resiliently on both sides in a cardan joint (29) and the springs (12.1, 12.2) of the spring/joint arrangement and can be adjusted continuously upwards on a movable linkage (13) of the lazy-tongs device, each part of the horizontal surface of the floor region can be reached and thus treated. For the treatment, oscillating abrasive blasting nozzles are situated in the interior of the abrasive blasting capsule (22) as surface treatment devices.

A device for surface treatment of large exposed 
substantially horizontal bottom surfaces of objects, 

particularly ships, and comprising 

a chassis (20) and 
a blasting capsule (22) connected to the chassis 
(20) and containing at least one surface-treating 

device (21.1, 21.2), characterised in that a scissor 
joint device (13, 18, 28) is disposed between the 

chassis (20) and the blasting capsule (22) below a 
spring-joint device (12.1, 12.2, 16, 19, 29) movable in 

three dimensions. 
A device according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the scissor joint device (13, 18, 28) comprises a 

scissor frame (13) made up of scissor bar elements 
(25.1, ... 25.n) movable from the scissors and/or 

scissor cross-pivots (26.1, ... 26n; 27.1, ... 27n) and 
also comprises a scissor base element (18) and a 

scissor upper element (28). 
A device according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that 


the first scissor bar element (25.1) is disposed 
in the first scissor pivot (26.1) so as to be movable 

in rotation in a slot (30) and the second scissor bar 
element (25.2) is disposed in the second scissor pivot 

(26.6) so as to be movable in rotation in the scissor 
base element (18) and  

 
the penultimate scissor bar element (25.n-1) is 

disposed in the penultimate scissor pivot (26.n-1) and 
the last scissor bar element (25.n) is disposed in the 

last scissor pivot (26.n) in a slit (31) so as to be 
movable in rotation in the upper scissor element (28). 
A device according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the spring-joint device comprises a plate element 

(19) having a universal joint (29) at its centre (Z) 
and springs (12.1, 12.2) on its upper periphery (P). 
A device according to claims 1 - 4, characterised 
in that the universal joint (29) is connected to the 

centre of the upper scissor element (28) and the 
springs (12.1, 12.2) are connected to the bottom 

periphery (P') of the blasting capsule (22). 
A device according to any of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that roller elements (24.1, 24.2) are 

disposed opposite the springs (12.1, 12.2). 
A device according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the blasting capsule (22) and the scissor joint 

device (13, 18, 19) and the spring-joint device (12.1, 
12.2, 19, 29) are disposed in front of
 a driver's cab 
(7). 
A device according to any of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the blasting capsule (22) is 

connected via a suction delivery hose (9) and at least 
one blasting-medium hose (10) to the blasting-nozzle of 

the surface-treatment device, which is equipped with an 
oscillator drive (21.1, 21.2).  

 
A device according to any of claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that the open side of the blasting 

capsule (22) is surrounded by sealing elements (23). 
A device according to any of claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that the sealing elements (23) are in 

the form of a combined rubber and brush seal. 
A device according to claim 10, characterised in 
that the combined rubber and brush seal is additionally 

provided with magnets. 
A device according to any of claims 1 to 11, 
characterised in that the driver's cab (7) is not 

higher than the topmost point (sealing elements 23) of 
the lowered blasting capsule.
