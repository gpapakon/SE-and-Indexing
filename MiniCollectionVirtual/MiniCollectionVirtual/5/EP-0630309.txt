<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus for recovering the
useful components of oil filters used in automotive, truck,
and other internal combustion engines. More particularly,
the invention relates to a highly automated apparatus for the
step-wise disassembly of oil filters into their component
parts for recovery and recycle, as a key part of a program to
gather, break-down and recycle the vast quantity of oil
filters removed from service every day. The apparatus
generates clean, pre-separated scrap components free of
contamination with other components. That is, the filter
elements are separate from the canisters and the heavier metal
base is recovered free of the canister as well. Paper and oil
do not contaminate the steel components.Modern transportation and numerous stationary industrial
engines require oil to function. The oil plays a vital role
in lubricating surfaces, carrying away harmful particulate,
and cooling the engine. Particulates carried in the oil are 
removed by cycling the oil through a filter. The typical oil filter for this purpose
comprises a substantial metal base, of steel or the like, a lighter weight canister,
and the filter element per se, usually a mass of fibrous material enclosed by the
canister and arranged to trap particulates in the oil and separate them. The metal
base is perforated to provide for oil passage into the canister. Periodic
replacement of the oil is essential to engine life. At such replacement the filter is
usually replaced as well. This process generates tens of millions of used filters
annually. Disposal of these filters is an environmental problem. First, their oil
content must be well drained. Then the oil impregnated filter element must be
captured for environmentally safe disposal, and the metal components, the
canister and base, directed to appropriate recyclers of these types of metal.The problem with recovery and recycle as just outlined is that as a practical matter
the gathering and processing of millions of units requires an enormous amount of
labor as the units are difficult to handle, hard to disassemble, and so numerous as
to overwhelm ordinary scrap recyclers.EP 0 279 469 describes an apparatus to replace the previous separation of oil
filter elements into their component parts carried out by hand by a mechanical
process. Main parts of the apparatus are the means for handling the oil cans and
bringing them into a position for cutting (i.e. elements 1 to 8). The oil filter, which is
brought into an upright position thereby, is thereafter cut by

clear said disassembly facility (L1) of said filter element (14) after said transfer
of said canister (16); and a second operating head (76) comprising means (80)

to transfer said base (18) from said disassembly facility (L1) to said recycling
facility (32) before further delivery of oil filters (12) to be disassembled.
Disassembly and recycling apparatus according to claim 1, in which the means
(24) to sever said canister from said base comprises cutting means (24)

including a cutting blade (90) and means (100, 102) for driving said oil filter (12)
arcuately in engaged relation of said pins (22) and said base (18).

operating head (56) comprises means (110) engaging said canister (16) free of

said base (18), said canister engaging means being shiftable translationally in
canister engaged relation from said disassembly facility (L1) to said recycling

facility (34).
Disassembly and recycling apparatus according to claim 3, in which said
engaging means (110) comprises clamping means (60) for clamping said

canister (16). 
Disassembly and recycling apparatus according to claim 1, in which said
second operating head (76) comprises means (80) engaging said base (18),

engaged relation from said disassembly facility (L1) to said facility for base

recycling (32).
Disassembly and recycling apparatus according to claim 5, in which said base
engaging means (76) comprises a magnet (80) for magnetically engaging said

base.
Disassembly and recycling apparatus according to claim 5, including also
separate recycling facilities (34, 32) for said canister (16) and said base (18),
