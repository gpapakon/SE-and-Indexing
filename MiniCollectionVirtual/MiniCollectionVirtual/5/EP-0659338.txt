<ABSTRACT>
The present disclosure concerns an intra-line fishing rod with 
at least one fishing line guide member inserted therein. According 

to the present invention, maintenance of fishing line guide members 
is facilitated. Support members S1,S2,S3,S4 are mounted inside a 

rod pipe while respectively supporting fishing line guide members 
G1,G2,G3,G4 which allow a fishing line to slide smoothly 

therethrough. The support members and fishing line guide members 
are positioned and removably mounted inside the rod pipe.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns the support of fishing line guide
members for an intra-line fishing rod of either the single or
multiple element type.Japanese Patent Publication No. 56-127032 to Showa discloses
an intra-line fishing rod in which a plurality of fishing line
guide members are secured to the inner surface of a rod pipe by
pressure or other means of bonding. The guide members are included
to reduce the resistance to the passage of a fishing line through
the fishing rod.A disadvantage of the above-mentioned conventional fishing rod
is that any of the fishing line guide members can come off from the
inner surface of the rod pipe due to flexing of the fishing rod or
the like. If the fishing rod is used with one or more guide
members detached, a number of problems may arise including
producing unacceptable noise, increased resistance and wear on the
fishing line, and an increased likelihood the fishing line will
break.To repair an intermediate fishing line guide member which has
become detached, the remaining members fixed to the inner surface
of the rod pipe between the end of the rod pipe and the detached 
member must be removed to gain access to the detached member. Each
member must thereafter be relocated and secured again, which is
both troublesome and inconvenient.Also, dust or the like is apt to collect between the fishing
line guide members. In order to clean out the dust or the like
from the conventional fishing rod, it is similarly necessary to
remove and reattach the members, which is very troublesome.A fishing rod having the features as set forth in the preamble
portion of claim 1 is known for example from FR-A-1,541,807.An object of the present invention is to provide an intra-line
fishing rod having an improved guiding structure
and which is capable of facilitating the maintenance of
the fishing line guide structure and associated elements disposed
inside the rod pipe.Said objective is performed by the features as set forth in the
characterising portion of claim 1Preferrably, the fishing rod
includes fishing line guide members which reduce the resistance on
a fishing line but are not attached to the inside of an intra-line
rod pipe. The fishing line guide members are accessed by removing
a tubular or semi-tubular support member which is mounted in the
rod pipe and which supports the fishing line guide members. This
facilitates maintenance of the fishing line guide members such as
cleaning, repair and replacement, as well as the cleaning of the
inner peripheral surface of the rod pipe.

<CLAIMS>
An intra-line fishing rod comprising a rod pipe (10) having a longitudinal axis and an

interior tubular surface surrounding the longitudinal axis, the fishing rod
comprising:


at least one support member (S1, S2, S3) retained within the interior tubular surface and
extending along said interior tubular surface of the rod pipe and its longitudinal

axis, 
characterized in that
said support member positions and retains a plurality of fishing line guide
member (G1, G2, G3) with respect to the rod pipe, and
securing means (H4) are further provided for securing said fishing line guide members
and said at least one support member along the longitudinal axis with respect to

the rod pipe,

wherein said fishing line guide members and said at least one support member
are routinely removable from the rod pipe upon disengaging the means for

securing same with respect to the rod pipe.
The fishing rod according to claim 1, wherein said fishing line guide members are
secured to an internal peripheral surface of said at least one support member,

said internal peripheral surface extends substantially parallel to the interior tubular
surface.
The fishing rod according to claim 1 or 2, wherein said securing means comprises
at least one holding member contiguously positioned at an axially end of said at

least one support member.
The fishing rod according to claim 3, wherein said holding member is secured to
each of said fishing line guide members. 
The fishing rod according to claim 3 or 4, wherein said at least one holding
member is axially interposed between two of said support members.
The fishing rod according to one of claims 3 to 5, wherein said security means
comprise further radial clearance means for absorbing looseness between said at

least one holding member and the rod pipe in a radial direction with respect to
said longitudinal axis.
