<ABSTRACT>
A pressure sensor (100, 222) integrally formed in the shape of a beam (102) around a central channel. The beam (102) has an integral blind end (104) that is pressurized by the fluid. The beam has an opposite end (106) that is shaped to provide a stepped corner (107) with a gap (108) opening at the base of the stepped corner (107), where the gap (108) and isolated from the fluid. A sensing film (112) in the channel adjacent the blind end (104) has an electrical parameter that varies with pressure and electrical leads (110) that extend from the channel and out the gap. A seal (115) fills the gap (108) around the leads (110) and the seal (115) fills a portion of the stepped corner (107). The sensor (100) is preferably formed by direct bonding of single crystal alumina layers (114, 116). Applications include industrial pressure transmitters, aerospace and turbine engine pressure sensing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to pressure
sensors.In aviation or industrial fluid pressure sensing
applications, fluids (pressurized media) can corrode
metal sensing films. Metal sensing films are thus
preferably placed inside a pressure sensor body and
connecting leads are preferably fed through the body
in such a way that corrosive process fluids do not
come in contact with the sensing films and connecting
leads, see for example WO-A-96/27123.
Corrosive process fluids can include gasses in
an aerospace or stationary turbine engine, acids,
caustics, oils, petrochemicals, and the like.Alumina is a preferred material for sensor bodies
because it has excellent mechanical properties and
corrosion resistance. It is, however, difficult to
bore vias in alumina for connecting leads between a
sensing film and an external electronic circuit.
Alumina sensors are preferably assembled by direct
bonding. With direct bonding, mating surfaces of
alumina layers are optically flat, clean and fully in
contact with one another, and no bonding substance is
used between layers. Any irregularity, such as a metal
film feedthrough at the mating surfaces, would hold
the mating surfaces apart by a microscopic amount and
interfere with the direct bonding.For demanding industrial, aerospace and turbine
applications, an easily manufactured feedthrough seal
is needed that does not' degrade the high performance
of a direct bonded alumina pressure sensor. The present invention provides a pressure sensor,
comprising a beam integrally formed around a central
channel, the beam having an integral blind end adapted
for fluid pressurization and an opposite end shaped to
provide a stepped corner with a gap opening at the
base of the stepped corner where the gap is isolated
from the fluid; a sensing film in the channel adjacent
the blind end, the sensing film having an electrical
parameter that varies with pressure and electrical
leads extending from the channel and out the gap; and
a seal filling the gap around the leads, the seal
filling a portion of the stepped corner.The present invention also provides a method of
manufacturing a pressure sensor, comprising shaping
multiple layers to form components of a beam;
depositing a sensing film on at least one of the
multiple layers; stacking the shaped layers in direct
contact with one another to form the beam having a
central channel that is blind at one end, and a
stepped corner with a gap opening at the base of the
stepped corner at the other end and the sensing film
is in the channel with
