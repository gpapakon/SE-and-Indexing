<ABSTRACT>
An exchangeable cassette for a manual device for transferring a film from a backing strip (52) onto a substrate has a cassette housing with two side walls (14, 15) between which there is seated a supply spool (54) for the backing strip (52), which supply spool runs from there in a loop (62) to a winding spool. In this case, the supply spool (54) and winding spool lie coaxially with one another, but on different sides of one side wall (16), so that the winding spool with the used backing strip (52) lies outside the cassette housing and can readily be removed. The cassette housing, a strip-guiding element (60) located therein, the supply-spool core (56) and tongues (26) which enclose the loop (62) from the outside in a protective manner all consist of the same material, preferably of cardboard.

A replacement cassette for a hand-held device for 
transferring a film from a carrier tape (52) to a substrate 

comprising a cassette housing with two parallel side walls 
(14,16) between which a supply spool (54) with a supply 

spool core (56) is provided, a push-through opening (42) 
associated with the supply spool core (56) being formed in 

the side wall (16) for a pivot bolt (70) on the device side 
of which the free diameter is at least as large as the 

internal diameter of the supply spool core (56), but is too 
small to allow the supply spool core (56) to pass through 

and the carrier tape (52) coming from the supply spool 
being guided over at least one tape guide element (60) 

extending substantially coaxially of the supply spool core 
(56) in the cassette housing, emerging from the cassette 

housing and, after forming a loop (62), being guided to a 
wind-on spool with a wind-on spool core (58); and further 

comprising a loop localizing mechanism arranged on the 
housing for substantially determining the alignment of the 

loop (62) in relation to the housing, characterized in that 
the supply spool (54) and the wind-on spool are arranged 

coaxially of one another, but on different sides of the 
side wall (16) with the push-through opening (42), the 

internal diameter of the wind-on spool core (58) being 
greater than that of the supply spool core (56) and the 

wind-on spool core (58) being releasably mounted on the 
outside of the side wall (16),
 
the tape guide element (60) being arranged in such a way 

that it extends on both sides of the side wall (16) so that 
it substantially covers the height occupied by the spool 

core (56,58) on the particular side,
 
the loop localizing mechanism consisting of two tongues 

(26) which surround the loop (62) from outside on both  
 

sides, project from the cassette housing, converge on one 
another along the sides of the loop and are separated at 

their ends by a gap which allows the loop (62) to be drawn 
through,
 
the end of the carrier tape (52) being releasably fixed to 

the supply spool core (56) and
 
the cassette housing, the supply spool core (56), the tape 

guide element (60) and the tongues (26) consisting of the 
same material. 
A replacement cassette as claimed in claim 1, characterized 
in that the housing with the side walls (14,16) and 

the tongues (26) are folded from a substantially flat blank 
(10) having preformed bending or folding lines (12). 
A replacement cassette as claimed in claim 2, characterized 
in that the blank is a plastic injection moulding 

of which the bending lines are in the form of film hinges. 
A replacement cassette as claimed in claim 2, characterized 
in that the blank is a cardboard blank (10) of 

which the bending lines are in the form of folding lines 
and/or score lines (12). 
A replacement cassette as claimed in any of claims 1 
to 4, characterized in that the two side walls (14,16) of 

the cassette housing lying one above the other comprise a 
preferably substantially circular main section (18) covering 

the supply spool (54) and an extension (20) which 
carries the tape guide element (60) and the tongues (26). 
A replacement cassette as claimed in claim 5 in 
conjunction with any of claims 2 to 4, characterized in 

that the unfolded blank (10) comprises the two main sections 
(18) adjacent one another, the two main sections 

being joined to one another by a distance strip (22) of 
which the ends are preferably in the form of stiffening  

 
laps (24) projecting on both sides, the two extensions (20) 

being arranged on mutually remote sides of the main sections 
(18) and comprising on their sides remote from one 

another two converging strips (26) which are arranged and 
designed in such a way that, when the blank is folded, two 

strips (26) lie adjacent one another to form a stiffened 
tongue. 
A replacement cassette as claimed in claim 5 or 6, 
characterized in that, adjacent the upper and lower side 

walls (14,16), the cassette housing comprises a base (28) 
which is positioned below and parallel to their extensions 

(20) and which is separated from the adjacent side wall 
(16) by an interval substantially corresponding to the 

height of the wind-on spool core (58) and in that the base 
(28) only extends so far up to the wind-on spool core (58) 

that a full wind-on spool can be freely removed from the 
cassette housing. 
A replacement cassette as claimed in claim 7, characterized 
in that the tape guide element is in the form of a 

rotatable cylindrical roller (60) which is arranged between

the free diameter is at least as large as the internal 

diameter but smaller than the external diameter of the 
hollow cylinder (60). 
A replacement cassette as claimed in claim 8 or 9, 
characterized in that a centring bore (34) is provided in 

the extension (20) of the lower side wall (16) to receive

opening (38) is provided in the base (28). 
A replacement cassette as claimed in any of claims 1
