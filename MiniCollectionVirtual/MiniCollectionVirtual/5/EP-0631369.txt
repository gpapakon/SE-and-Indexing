<ABSTRACT>
A voltage multiplier for relatively high output 
current has its design output voltage stabilized and 

rendered independent of process spread, temperature, 
supply voltage and output current level, by a stabilization 

loop driving the switch that cyclically 
connects to ground a charge transfer capacitance of the 

functional voltage multiplier circuit. The feedback 
loop comprises an integrating stage, stabilized by 

creating a low-frequency zero in the transfer function 
for compensating one of two low-frequency poles of the 

transfer function of the whole circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a voltage multiplier 
or voltage booster, provided with a circuit for 
stabilizing its output voltage. Often in electronic systems there is a need of 
generating a DC voltage higher than the supply voltage. 
Such a voltage boosting function is commonly effected 
with a so-called voltage multiplier of voltage booster. The circuit of a voltage booster may be considerably 
different depending on the level of the current that 
the circuit should be able to deliver. For relatively low output current levels (in the 
order of 10 µA), as in the case of write operations of 
EPROM memories, an often used solution is the circuit 
shown in Fig. 1a (employing bipolar junction transistors 
BJT) or in Fig. 1b (employing MOS transistors), as 
described in the article: "Analysis and Modelling of 
On-Chip High-Voltage Generator Circuits for Use in 
EEPROM Circuits", published in the October 1989 issue 
of the IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits. Conversely, when the voltage multiplier must deliver 
output currents of a remarkable level (in the order of 
ten mA), as in the case of analog integrated circuits 
wherein the supply voltage must be doubled or tripled 
for attaining certain performances, a typical solution 
requires the employment of at least two large capacitances 
(normally external to the integration circuit). 
A first capacitor C1 permits to load and transfer 
electric charges, while the second capacitor C2 has 
the function of storing the cyclically transferred 
charge, as schematically depicted in Fig. 2. The four 
switches (SW1, SW2, SW3, SW4) are driven by first and  
 
second phase control signals (₁ and ₂). Basically, during a first phase (₁) of the control 
clock, the capacitance C1 is connected between VCC and 
ground (GND) and therefore a voltage equal to VCC 
develops on the "upper" armature as referred to the 
"lower" armature of the capacitor that is connected to 
ground. During a second phase (₂) of the control 
clock, the lower armature is connected to VCC while the 
upper armature is connected to the output node (on C₂), 
onto which a voltage Vsur develops. If the output current is null, intuitively, after 
several clock periods, the output voltage Vsur would 
become equal to 2·VCC and perfectly stable. The output capacitance C2 stores the output voltage 
Vsur. Should be needed to triple the voltage VCC, it is 
sufficient to employ two capacitances C1a and C1b, which 
during the phase ₁, would both charge to VCC, while 
during the successive phase ₂, would
