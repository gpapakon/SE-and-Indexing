<ABSTRACT>
A method for the injection-moulding of articles comprising at least two different layers (10,14) provides that at least one layer, preferably the outer layer (10), is produced from a lacquer. This can be achieved with an apparatus in which a mould (9) is preceded by at least one main injection assembly (2,3) having an injection unit (7) allowing the injection-moulding of multilayered articles.

<CLAIMS>
Device for injection moulding of articles (1) consisting of at least two different
layers, in which at least one main injection apparatus (2; 3) with an injection unit (7; 107),

which permits injection-moulding of multi-layer articles and comprises an injection nozzle
(6; 106), is connected upstream of a mould tool (9), characterised in that the injection unit

(107) has an injection nozzle (106) with nozzle needles (15, 16) inserted from the front.
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the nozzle needles (15, 16) are
connected with a hydraulic part (21) by way of quick-action couplings (19, 20).
