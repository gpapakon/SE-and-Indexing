<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a dry, fine particle
size particulate hydraulic cement composition, to a method
of forming a hydrocarbon liquid or water slurry using said
composition, and to a method of utilizing such slurries.In our US-A-5,238,064 (Dahl et al.; EP-A-0 564 294) we
disclose a method of using a fine particle size cement in a
hydrocarbon slurry to prevent the flow of unwanted water
from a subsurface formation into a wellbore.Subterranean formations sometimes produce unwanted
water from natural fractures as well as from fractures
produced by forces applied deliberately or accidentally
during production operations. It is known that such
fractures provide a path of least resistance to the flow of
fluid from a formation to a wellbore. When the fluid
flowing in a fracture is primarily oil, the fracture is
considered to be beneficial and thus desirable; however,
when the fluid flowing in the fracture from the formation to
the wellbore is primarily water the fracture is considered
to be a problem and thus undesirable. Dahl et al have shown
that the undesirable fracture can be filled with fine cement
to plug it and thereby terminate the flow of fluid therein.The fine particle size cement used by Dahl can be
placed in a subterranean fracture as well as in a high
permeability zone of the formation by the application of
conventional procedures. The cement itself, although it is 
highly reactive due to its small particle size, can be
rendered temporarily non-reactive by preventing contact
between it and water prior in time to actual placement of
the cement into the fracture. Accordingly the fine cement
is dispersed in a relatively low viscosity, relatively non-volatile
liquid hydrocarbon, such as diesel oil, to form a
pumpable slurry of cement in oil.The dispersion of the cement in the non-volatile
liquid hydrocarbon is assisted by use of an appropriate
surfactant. Thus, a mixture of the fine cement with a
liquid hydrocarbon, in the absence of a surfactant, produces
a blend having a viscosity so high that the blend cannot be
pumped by conventional means into the desired location in
the formation. Use of a surfactant results in a blend of
cement in hydrocarbon having a sufficiently low viscosity to
permit convenient conventional introduction of the blend
into the desired location in the formation.Furthermore, it has also been found that the high
beneficial hydraulic activity of the fine particle size
cement can be unduly reduced upon contact with a
hydrocarbon, but that the problem can also be avoided by
