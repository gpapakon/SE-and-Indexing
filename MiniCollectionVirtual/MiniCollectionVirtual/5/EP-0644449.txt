<ABSTRACT>
An insulating buffer layer (4) of SiO₂ is formed on 
a substrate (1) of LiNbO₃ crystal in which optical waveguides (2) 

are formed, and a semiconducting film of Si is formed on 
the buffer layer. An insulating diffusion suppressing 

layer of SiO₂ is formed on the semiconducting film, and a 
pair of electrodes (3) of Au are located on the diffusion 

suppressing layer. The formation of silicide by solid-phase 
diffusion of the electrodes into the semiconducting 

film can be prevented by the diffusion suppressing layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a
dielectric optical waveguide device, and more particularly
to an improved technique for effecting a high reliability
and a long service life of such a dielectric
optical waveguide device.An optical waveguide device is known as a kind
of optical device such as optical modulator. The optical
waveguide device has an advantage such that it can be
easily reduced in size and weight from a viewpoint of
structure and can be mass-produced by using a planar
technique or the like. In particular, a ferroelectric
optical waveguide device, which is constructed of a
substrate formed of ferroelectric crystal, an optical
waveguide formed in the substrate by thermal diffusion of
metal or oxide thereof, and a pair of metal electrodes
arranged on the substrate, can control a refractive index
according to an applied voltage, so that the ferroelectric
optical waveguide device is applied to various
optical devices. A conventional dielectric optical waveguide
device is disclosed in EP-A- 444 959 and is constructed, for example, of a substrate formed
of ferroelectric crystal, an optical waveguide formed in
a part of the surface of the substrate by thermal diffusion
of metal or oxide thereof, an insulating buffer
layer formed on the surface of the substrate in which the
optical waveguide is formed, a semiconducting film formed
on the buffer layer, and a pair of metal electrodes
arranged in spaced relationship from each other on the
semiconducting film.The reason why the insulating buffer layer is
formed on the substrate is to reduce light absorption to
the electrodes, and the reason why the electrodes are
located on the semiconducting film is to avoid that
electric charges generated by a pyroelectric effect due
to a temperature change will be concentrated under the
electrodes. The semiconducting film is formed of silicon
(Si) in view of manufacturability, stability, etc., and
the electrodes are formed of gold (Au).In the conventional dielectric optical waveguide
device, however, a solid-phase alloying reaction
occurs at a joined portion of the semiconducting film of
silicon or the like to the electrodes of gold or the
like. In the case where the solid-phase alloying reaction 
between silicon and gold occurs, gold silicide is
formed. This reaction proceeds with the passage of time
to cause a problem that the pair of electrodes are finally
short-circuited. In particular, the higher the temperature,
the faster the progress of the solid-phase
alloying reaction, so that the above problem
