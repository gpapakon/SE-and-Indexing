<CLAIMS>
A retaining device for the rollover body of a rollover protection system for motor
vehicles, having a retaining member (1) which is fastened to the rollover body and has a

retaining pin (3) which is in disengageable mechanical operative connection with a release
member (15) of a sensor-controlled release system (13), 
characterised in that
 the retaining
pin (3) is mounted in the retaining member (1) in a radially resiliently yielding manner.
A retaining device according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the retaining member (1)
has a receiving body (2) having through-bores (9) in two opposite regions for receiving the

retaining pin (3), which through-bores (9) have a resiliently yielding lining (10).
A retaining device according to claim 2, 
characterised in that
 the through-bores (9) are
constructed in the wall of the receiving body (2) as a slot extending transversely to the

direction of action of the retaining force.
A retaining device according to claim 3, 
characterised in that
 the slot through-bores (9)
are constructed as stepped slots having the larger recess (9a) at the wall-side end, and there is

received in the larger recess (9a) a resiliently yielding insert (10) of complementary shape.
A retaining device according to claim 4, 
characterised in that
 the stepped recess (9a) is
formed in the receiving body (2) eccentrically with respect to the slot through-bores (9) in such

a manner that the retaining pin (3) rests directly against the wall of the slot through-bores (9)
in the direction of action of the retaining force.
A retaining device according to any one of claims 2 to 5, 
characterised in that
 the
through-bores (9) have bearing necks (8) for the retaining pin (3) which are integrally formed

on the inside.
A retaining device according to any one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that
 there
are supported on the retaining pin (3) bearing necks (8) which are part of an H-shaped 

connection member (21) having at each of its ends remote from the bearing necks (8) an
adjusting peg (22, 23) for mounting in the receiving body (2).
A retaining device according to any one of claims 4 to 7, 
characterised in that
 the
insert (10) consists of an elastomeric material, preferably cellular rubber.
A retaining device according to any one of claims 2 to 8, 
characterised in that
 the
receiving body is bell-shaped and two fastening lugs (4) for fastening to a clamping collar (6)

are integrally formed on its upper side, and the clamping collar (6) is connectable to the
rollover body.
A retaining device according to any one of claims 2 to 8, having a rollover body in the
form of a U-shaped roll bar with two parallel leg pipes which are connected to each other at

their open ends via a cross-piece (16) formed by a profiled section body, 
characterised in
that
 the receiving body (2) is integrated in the cross-piece (16).
