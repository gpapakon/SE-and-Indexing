<ABSTRACT>
2.1. Porous bodies, for example cast components of aluminium, can be sealed by filling the pores with a curable liquid and curing the liquid. Since only the pores are filled, the article to be impregnated is immersed under vacuum into the curable liquid and the excess liquid is washed off with water. This necessitates good washing characteristics in the impregnating liquid. 2.2. A combination of (meth)acrylates which are of relatively good solubility in water with ethylenically unsaturated monomers having a C8-C20 radical and a surfactant provides excellent washing-off characteristics with good impregnating properties, good elasticity and low weight loss on heat treatment. The impregnating liquid may advantageously also contain free-radical initiators and may be heat-curable. 2.3. Impregnation of cast metal pieces, for example engine or transmission components.

a (meth)acrylate at least 20 wt.% soluble in water and/or   up to 85 wt.%
b hydroxyalkyl (meth)acrylate at least 5 wt.% and less than 20 wt.% soluble in water   up to 80 wt.%

8
-C
20
 alkyl residue    4-40 wt.%
C surfactant    4-40 wt.%
optionally D copolymerisable monomers, limited to 5 wt.%
optionally E crosslinking agent, limited to at most 30 wt.%

optionally

together with F a radical former and an inhibitor,

wherein the individual components are adjusted
relative to each other in such a manner that 1 ml of

the impregnating liquid added dropwise from a height
of approx. 10 cm within 1 minute to 50 ml of water at

a temperature of 90°C is at least 90% emulsified after 
a further 15 seconds and all the weight percentages

relate to the sum of components A-D (including a and
b).
Impregnating liquid according to claim 1,

characterised in that

E crosslinking agents are limited to    10 wt.%
with (meth) acrylic crosslinking agents being limited to    6 wt.%.
Impregnating liquid according to claim 1,

characterised in that

the A/B ratios are between 2.5 and 7.
Impregnating liquid according to one of the preceding
claims,

characterised in that

it contains up to 20 wt.% of plasticiser.
Use of an impregnating liquid according to one of
claims 1-4 in a process for impregnating a porous

solid article, in particular a casting or sintered
component made from metal, by filling the pores in a

manner known 
per se
 with a polymerisable impregnating
liquid, rinsing the solid object with water once the

pores have been filled with the impregnating liquid
and polymerising the impregnating liquid in the pores.
Use according to claim 5,

characterised in that,

before the impregnating liquid is introduced into the
pores, it is combined with a radical former and an

inhibitor. 
Use according to one of claims 5 or 6,

characterised in that

the impregnating liquid located in the pores is
polymerised by immersing the solid object in water at

a temperature of ≥ 70°C.
