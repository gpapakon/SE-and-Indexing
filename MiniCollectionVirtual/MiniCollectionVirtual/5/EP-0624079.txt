<ABSTRACT>
An electric toothbrush part (24) contains a rotary shaft (34) which may be reciprocated or rotated. The axis of rotation (54) of a bristle-bearer (38) rotatively mounted on the toothbrush part (24) is approximately perpendicular to the axis of rotation (52) of the shaft (34). An approximately parallel and eccentric rod (102) is movably received in the shaft (34). A pin (112) which is approximately parallel and eccentric with respect to the axis of rotation (54) is held in a ring shoulder (61) of the bristle-bearer (38). The pin (112) extends through an eyelet (103) arranged at the free end of the rod (102) and is movable therein. When the shaft (34) is rotated or reciprocated, this movement is transmitted by the rod (102), the eyelet (103) and the pin (112) to the bristle-bearer (38). The bristle-bearer (38) is always alternatingly rotated, whether the shaft (34) is reciprocated or rotated.

An electric toothbrush as claimed in any one of 
the claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that
 the shaft (34) 
is adapted to be driven so as to perform an alternating 

or a rotary motion. 
An electric toothbrush as claimed in any one of 
the claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that

(61a) and an inner bristle ring (61b) which are both rotary 
about the axis of rotation (54) of the bristle supporting 

structure (38), that the outer bristle ring (61a) 
is operatively associated with a first driven means 

(110a, 112a) coupled to a first driving means (100a, 
102a, 103a), and that the inner bristle ring (61b) is operatively 

associated with a second driven means (110b, 
112b) coupled to a second driving means (100b, 102b, 

103b). 
An electric toothbrush as claimed in claim 9, 

characterized in that
