<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the color of
compounded polymer(s) and, more particularly, to a
system for closed-loop feedback control of the color
of the compounded polymer(s).Contemporary plastics are typically
comprised of one or more base polymers or resins, one
or more colorants or colorant additives, and other
additives. Such additives may include, for example,
fiberglass for structural reinforcement, flame
retardants, plasticizers, or mold release agents. The
plastics are manufactured by mixing these
constituents, usually by machine, to form a
substantially homogeneous polymer mixture. In this
context, a substantially homogeneous compounded
polymer mixture is distinguished from a polymer
mixture having a substantially uniform color. In
addition to the heat produced by mixing these
constituents, termed "shear heat," other external heat
may also be supplied. The resulting material,
frequently produced in the form of strands, webs,
bars, sheets or films, to name only a few possible 
shapes, may after at least partial solidification of the mixture, then be pelletized to
produce a final polymer product.EP-A-0,191,338 discloses an apparatus and method for controlling the
color of a mixed polymer, comprising a compounder for mixing a polymer with a
colorant additive, a spectrophotometric colorimeter as a color sensor, a colorant
additive feeder, and a controller responsive to the sensor to control the rate of feed of
the colorant additive by the feeder. US-A-4,403,866 discloses a similar system for
mixing paints to produce a desired color.Experience has shown that the color of the resulting polymer product
may depend upon several factors. These include, among others, the concentration and
type of colorants, the base resins employed and their concentration by weight, the
temperature history during mixing, and the ultimate degree of constituent inter-mixing
achieved during processing. Thus, variations in color between polymer products may
arise for a large variety of reasons. For example, color may vary among products due
to polymer product formulation or recipe differences. Likewise, color variations may
exist between lots for a given product formulation or recipe due to, for example,
machine-to-machine differences. Furthermore, color differences may exist within lots
due to changing raw material characteristics, changing operating conditions, and
inaccuracies and other anomalies in processing, such as differences in the constituent
feed rates. Thus, a need exists for a reliable and effective means or method
