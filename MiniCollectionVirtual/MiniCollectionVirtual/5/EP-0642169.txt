<ABSTRACT>
An ohmic electorde of the present invention 
comprises a contact electrode layer formed on a p-type 

diamond semiconductor layer formed on a substrate so as 
to be in ohmic contact with the p-type diamond 

semiconductor layer and to have low contact resistance 
and high heat resistance, and a lead electrode layer 

formed on the contact electrode layer so as to have low 
lead wire resistance and high heat resistance. 

Specifically, the contact electrode layer is made of 
either a carbide of at least one metal selected from a 

metal group comprising Ti, Zr, and Hf, or a carbide of an 
alloy containing at least one metal selected from the 

metal group. Since the carbide of the metal or alloy 
forming the contact electrode layer is st
abler in respect 
of energy because of reduced formation enthalpy than the 

metal or alloy itself, it is very unlikely to diffuse. 
Therefore, little metal or alloy forming the contact 

electrode layer precipitates on the surface of the lead 
electrode layer formed on the contact electrode layer, 

thus improving the device performance, based on the 
reduced lead wire resistance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ohmic electrode
with high heat resistance and low contact resistance,
formed on a p-type diamond semiconductor and a method for
forming it.Diamond has a large bandgap of about 5.5 eV and thus
has no temperature range corresponding to the intrinsic
region below 1400 °C. It is, therefore, excellent in heat
resistance. Also, diamond has the thermal conductivity
of 20 W/cm·K, which is ten times larger than that of
silicon. Thus, it is also excellent in heat radiation.
Because of such properties, semiconductor devices made of
diamond can be operated at high temperature and can be
improved in the degree of integration of circuits.These days, p-type diamond semiconductors formed by
doping diamond with boron are expected to be applied to
light-emitting devices to emit light in the range of
various wavelengths from ultraviolet light to visible
light, environmentally resistant semiconductor devices
required to have high heat resistance and high thermal
conductivity, and etc. In order to produce such
semiconductor devices, ohmic electrodes formed on the p-type 
diamond semiconductor need be provided with high
heat resistance and low contact resistance.A conventional ohmic electrode is formed by
successively building a contact electrode layer of Ti, a
diffusion barrier layer of Mo, and a lead electrode layer
of Au up on a p-type diamond semiconductor. Ti forming
the contact electrode layer is a metal having a
relatively high melting point, but has a resistivity of
higher than materials such as Au, Al, etc. Thus, Au is
layered as a lead electrode layer above the contact
electrode layer so as to reduce lead wire resistance in
order to improve device performance.However, when the lamination structure of Ti and Au
is subjected to heat treatment at a temperature of about
300 °C, Ti forming the contact electrode layer readily
diffuses into Au forming the lead electrode layer to
precipitate over the surface of the lead electrode layer,
thus increasing the lead wire resistance. Even in use at
room temperature current supply to such a semiconductor
device causes Joule heat generated to induce mutual
diffusion of Ti and Au, which results in precipitation of
Ti over the surface of the lead electrode layer. To
prevent the diffusion of Ti, Mo is interposed as a
diffusion barrier layer between the contact electrode
layer and the lead electrode layer.The above prior art technology is described in 
detail in Japanese Laid-open Patent Applications No. 1-246867
and No. 2-260470.In the above
