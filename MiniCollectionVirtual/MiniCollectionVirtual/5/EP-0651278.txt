<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to ferroelectric liquid
crystal display devices and, more particularly, to ferroelectric
liquid crystal display devices capable of gradational
display.Ferroelectric liquid crystals were discovered by Meyer
et al in 1975. Thereafter in 1980, applications of ferroelectric
liquid crystals to such device as surface- stabilized
ferroelectric liquid crystal display device were
proposed by Clark and Lagerwall. This ferroelectric liquid
crystal display device, in which a ferroelectric liquid
crystal having a chiral smectic C phase is sandwiched between
a pair of substrates with a slight clearance as small
as about 2µm, utilizes a switching between two stable states
provided by the ferroelectric liquid crystal. The switching
is attributed to direct interaction between the spontaneous
polarization of the ferroelectric liquid crystal and an
electric field. Therefore, the response speed is very fast, 
typically, several dozens µsec, which is 1000 times faster
than that of a nematic liquid crystal display device utilizing
a dielectric anisotropy of a nematic liquid crystal.
The ferroelectric liquid crystals also have a major characteristic
of a memory effect. The combination of the memory
effect and fast response will realize a liquid crystal
display device with a high display capacity which has more
than 1000 scanning lines.The ferroelectric liquid crystals are expected to
become next-generation liquid crystals, and are now being
intensively researched. One of the major problems in a
practical application of the ferroelectric liquid crystals
is a difficulty in realizing a gradational display. The
conventional approaches to the gradational display include
area division, analog gradation, and time division (or
multiplexing), for which many proposals and reports have
been made. However, it has never been reported or proposed
that ferroelectric liquid crystal display devices having a
display capacity of multi-scale gradation such as full-scale
gradation or 256-scale gradation were put into commercial
use. One of the conventional approaches to gradational
display was reported by W.J.A.M. Hartmann in Ferroelectrics,
Vol.122, pp1-26 (1991).Among the aforesaid three approaches, the area division
approach realizes a gray-scale display generated in accordance 
with an area ratio between bright portion and dark
portion which appear on a pixel divided into plural areas by
a given area ratio. To realize a 256-scale gradation, for
example, one pixel is divided into partition areas by an
area ratio
