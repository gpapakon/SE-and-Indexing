<ABSTRACT>
A highly active water-dispersible pesticide 
formulation is prepared by dissolving at least a part of 

a benzoyl phenyl urea series insecticidal compound in an 
organic solvent, contacting the so obtained mixture with 

a carrier material, and pulverizing the resulting 
mixture. The pesticidal formulation obtained has higher 

pesticidal activity than formulations prepared by a 
conventional dry methods.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
the preparation of highly active water-dispersible 
pesticide formulations, more particularly, to a process 
for the preparation of a water-dispersible pesticide 
formulation comprising as an active ingredient a 
pesticidal component of the benzoyl phenyl urea series. Many water-dispersible pesticide formulations 
comprising as an active ingredient a benzoyl phenyl urea 
compound, such as diflubenzuron, triflumuron, 
chlorofluazuron, teflubenzuron or flufenoxuron are 
known. These conventional water-dispersible pesticide 
formulations are prepared by adding the active 
ingredient to a carrier and a surface active agent, and 
mixing and pulverizing them. At the time of 
application, such a water-dispersible pesticide is 
diluted with water to form a suspension to spray on an 
object. The conventional water-dispersible pesticide or 
wettable powder formulations comprising, for example, 
diflubenzuron, triflumuron, chlorofluazuron,  
 
teflubenzuron or flufenoxuron as an active ingredient 
are defective in that the activity is lower than that of 
an emulsion. Accordingly, when a conventional 
water-dispersible pesticide is diluted with water and 
the resulting suspension is sprayed on an object, in 
order to attain a high pesticidal effect, it is 
necessary to spray a large quantity of the suspension, 
and problems such as environmental pollution and 
increased costs arise. The inventors made research into developing a 
process for preparing a water-dispersible pesticide 
having none of the above-mentioned defects, and as a 
result, found that when a water-dispersible pesticide 
formulation is prepared by using a part or all of an 
active ingredient in the form of a solution in an 
organic solvent, such as acetone or 
N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, to mix the active ingredient 
with a carrier and the like, a formulation having very 
high pesticidal effect can be obtained. More specifically, in accordance with the 
present invention, there is provided a process for 
preparing a highly active water-dispersible pesticide, 
which comprises dissolving at least a part of an 
insecticidally effective benzoyl phenyl urea series 
compound represented by the following formula: 
 
 
wherein
 
x represents Cl, F, Br or CF₃;
 
Y represents H, Cl, F or Br;
 
z represents, Cl, F, Br, CN, CF₃, CHF₂, OCF₃, 
OCF₂H, SCF₃, OCF₂CHF₂, OCF₂CHFCl, OCF₂CHFBr or a 
substituent of the formula 
 
wherein E represents CH or N and J represents H, Cl, F, 
or Br; and
 
A, B, and D each
