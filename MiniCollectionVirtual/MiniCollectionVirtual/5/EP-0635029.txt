<DESCRIPTION>
 CARTILAGE MATRIX PROTEIN AND METHODS FOR USEBackground of the Invention This invention relates to cartilage matrix protein.Cartilage matrix protein (CMP) is a noncollagenous protein of the extracellular matrix of cartilage. CMP is a homotrimer of disulfide bond linked subunits.Argraves et al. (Proc. Nat 'l . Acad . Sci . USA 84:464, 1987) and Kiss et al. (J. Biol . Chem. 264:8126, 1989) disclose that chicken CMP includes a domain (residues 148-183) with significant homology to epidermal growth factor and two homologous repeat sequences (residues 30-220 and 262-450) . The homologous repeats (CMP-1 and CMP-2 respectively) are homologous to regions within von illebrand factor, complement factor B, complement factor C2, type VI collagen, and the α chains of the integrins Mac-1, pl50,95 and LFA-1 (see Kiss et al. , supra for a review) . Human CMP is 79% identical to chicken CMP overall; human and chicken CMP-1 domains are 79% identical; human and chicken CMP-2 domains are 84% identical (Jenkins et al., J. Biol . Chem. 265:19624, 1990).CMP may interact with both proteoglycan and collagen (Goetinck et al., Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences 599:29, 1990).Bonaldo et al. (Biochemistry 29:1245, 1990) report that type VI collagen has several repeats homologous to CMP and that a region which includes these repeats is involved in interactions between type VI collagen and type I collagen.Summary of the Invention In general, the invention features a polypeptide (preferably substantially pure) which is a fragment or 

analog of cartilage matrix protein, the polypeptide being capable of binding collagen.In various preferred embodiments: the polypeptide includes CMP-1 or CMP-2; the polypeptide includes a fragment or analog of CMP-1 or CMP-2; the polypeptide is or comprises all or part of CMP-1, e.g., an N-terminal fragment of CMP-1 approximately 45 a ino acids in length, or the approximately 8-10 residue collagen binding sequence 1 (CBS1, defined in detail below) motif; the polypeptide is or comprises all or part of CMP-2, e.g., a N-terminal fragment of CMP-2 approximately 45 amino acids in length, or the approximately 8-10 residue CBS1 motif of CMP-2; the polypeptide is or comprises a CBS1 motif; and the polypeptide is all or part of CMP-1 and CMP-2.In a related aspect, the invention features a method for forming collagen fibrils. The method includes contacting cartilage matrix protein, or a polypeptide of the invention, with collagen. In preferred embodiments the polypeptide is fragment or analog of cartilage
