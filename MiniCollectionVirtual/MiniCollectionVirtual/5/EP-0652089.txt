<ABSTRACT>
a) Process and apparatus for treating wood, particularly beams of frameworks against parasites. b) Process characterised in that:   - the pieces to be treated are enveloped with a heating electrical element, the external surface of which has good heat-insulating (lagging) characteristics, closely covering the piece to be treated, - a temperature profile as a function of time is controlled in order to bring the core (heart) of the piece to be treated up to a given temperature, guaranteeing the destruction of the parasites inside the wood, - the temperature profile is determined as a function of the nature and age of the wood as well as of the cross-section of the piece to be treated, - the, preferably alternating, supply to the various heating elements is controlled using a control station, and at the end of the treatment each heating element is removed.

Process for thermally treating pieces of wood
using heat, against parasites, in which process:


the pieces to be treated are enveloped using one or
several electrical heating elements, the external

surface of which has good thermal insulation properties,
which cover closely the piece to be treated,
a time-dependent temperature profile is established
in order to drive the core of the piece to be

treated to a predetermined temperature, ensuring
that the parasites inside the wood are destroyed,
the temperature profile is determined depending on
the nature and age of the wood, on the moisture

content and the cross-section of the piece to be
treated,
the temperature of the pieces is detected using
temperature sensors associated with each element,
the supply, preferably AC, of the various heating
elements is controlled by means of a control unit

equipped with a microcomputer in order to manage the
temperature curves of the heating element or

elements according to a given programme and, at the
end of the treatment, each heating element is

removed.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the various heating elements are supplied in an

interdigitated manner.
Apparatus for thermally treating wood against
parasites, for the implementation of the process according

to Claim 1, which apparatus is characterized in that 
it comprises:


a set of electrical heating elements in the form of
flexible sheets (1-4, 200, 300), the internal surface

of which is for heating and the external
surface for insulating, these elements being

provided with electrical connection means (11-14,
207, 307),
an electrical supply unit (15) to which the heating
elements (1-4) are connected, this unit adjusting

the electrical supply to the heating elements
depending on a predetermined temperature, the

elements (1-4, 200, 300) being sequentially supplied
when several elements are being used simultaneously,
a control panel (16) equipped with a microcomputer
in order to manage the temperature curves of the

heating element or elements according to a given
programme,
temperature sensors (21-24, 205, 206, 310, 311, 312)
associated with each element in order to detect the

temperature of the piece to be treated, these temperature
data being transmitted to the control panel

(16) which controls the temperature curve of the
corresponding heating element depending on this

datum and on parameters relating to the material of
the piece and to its dimensions.
Apparatus according to Claim 3; characterized in
that the heating element (200) is a rectangular shape.
Apparatus according to Claim 3, characterized in
that the heating element (300) is T-shaped.
Apparatus according to Claim 3, characterized in
that the heating element (200, 300) includes attachments

(201, 202, 203, 204, 303, 304, 305, 306).
