<ABSTRACT>
A purse string suturing instrument is provided for 
quickly and effectively forming a purse string suture 

in tubular tissue through relatively small cannulas 
placed in the body. The instrument includes a pair of 

elongated jaws (24,26), each having a row of spaced-apart 
uniform-size teeth (30). The jaws are hinged together at 

one end to clamp the tubular tissue therebetween. The 
two rows of teeth are offset with respect to each other 

so that they mesh when the jaws are closed. A single 
operating mechanism (16,126,130) is provided to articulate the pair 

of jaws with respect to a longitudinal axis of the 
suturing instrument and actuate the jaws between an 

open position and a clamping position. The jaws are 

inserted through a cannula and positioned to close 
around the tissue to be sutured. The rows of teeth 

bend the tissue therebetween into a wavelike 
configuration. A pair of needles (20), the ends of each 

being connected to a single length of suture (21), is then 
inserted through passageways provided through the 

teeth. An encircling series of stitches are thus 
formed in the wall of the tubular tissue to create a 

purse string suture. The needles and the suturing 
instrument are then withdrawn through the cannula. The 

tubular tissue can be snugly fitted over an anastomosis 
ring or the like by drawing and tying the purse string 

suture.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an instrument of placing a 
purse string suture in a bowel or other section of 
tubular tissue and for performing the 
procedure quickly and without having to open the 
patient completely. It is sometimes necessary in performing operations on 
sections of the alimentary canal to have to put a purse 
string suture in that tubular tissue. This occurs, for 
example, when the severed ends of the bowel are 
rejoined by anastomosis. A biofragmentable anastomosis 
ring is used to provide a mechanically locking 
connection that maintains contact between the ends of 
the intestine in an inverted anastomosis. A purse 
string suture is used to draw each of the severed ends 
of the intestine snugly around the barrel of the ring. 
The ring produces secure serosa-to-serosa apposition of 
the ends of the intestine and maintains a satisfactory 
patency until healing occurs and the ring degrades into 
small harmless fragments, which are eliminated from the 
body. Anastomosis rings are used in the treatment of 
various disease processes for which intestinal 
resection and anastomosis is indicated, for example, 
carcinoma, diverticular disease, and colostomy closure.  
 Placing a purse string suture in tubular tissue has 
generally required fully opening the body cavity. It 
would be desirable if there were a procedure for doing 
so without such a large incision, for example by 
accessing the body cavity through one or two cannulas 
instead. EP-A-598 976 discloses a device in which the operating means 
differ from the present invention where a single rotatable knob 
imparts both linear movement to the camming and to the driving 
rod.  
 EP-A-598 976 belongs to the prior art by virtue of Article 54(3) 
EPC. It is an object of the invention to provide a purse 
string suturing instrument with an operating mechanism 
that can be simply and easily manipulated to operate 
the suturing instrument. This object is achieved by the surgical purse string suturing 
instrument in accordance with claim 1. It allows quickly and 
effectively putting a purse string suture in a bowel or other 
section of tubular tissue using techniques known as least or 
minimally invasive surgery without having to fully open the 
body cavity. In one aspect of the present invention, a suturing 
instrument is comprised of an elongated shaft; a pair 
of relatively movable jaws for clamping the tubular 
tissue therebetween, the first jaw being substantially 
pivotable with respect to the second jaw about a first 
pivot axis,
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A surgical suturing instrument for placing a purse string suture in a tubular 
tissue, said instrument comprising: 


a pair of relatively movable jaws (15) for clamping the tubular tissue 
therebetween, a first jaw (24) of said pair of jaws (15) being pivotable with respect to 

a second jaw (26) about a first pivot axis (28), each jaw having a row of spaced-apart, 
uniform-size teeth (30), whereby a substantially straight passageway is defined at the 

bottom of the teeth which permits the transit of a thread pulling needle (20); actuating 
means for actuating said pair of jaws between an open position for receiving the 

tubular tissue and a clamping position where the row of teeth of said first jaw meshes 
with the row of teeth of said second jaw; 
a camming rod (34) slidably disposed to operate on at least one of said 
jaws and pivot said pair of jaws (15) about a third pivot axis (76) transverse to the first 

pivot axis (28); and 
operating means for sliding said camming rod (34) to articulate said pair of 
jaws (15) about the third pivot axis and sliding a driving rod (54) to actuate said pair 

of jaws (15) about the first pivot axis (28), whereby said operating means includes a single 
rotatable knob (16) and motion imparting means for imparting rotational movement of 

said knob into linear movement of both said camming rod (34) and said driving rod (54). 
A surgical suturing instrument according to Claim 1, further comprising an 
elongated shaft (68) for slidably housing said camming rod (34) and said driving rod 

(54), said shaft being connected to said operating means at a first end and said pair 
of jaws (15) at a second end.  

 
A surgical suturing instrument according to Claim 1, wherein each tooth 
includes a base and a crest, the two rows being opposed and offset with respect to 

each other in the clamping position so that the rows of teeth mesh when the jaws are 
closed, thereby bending the tubular tissue between the rows of teeth into a wavelike 

configuration with a two-wall thickness of the tissue overlying the crest of each tooth. 
A surgical suturing instrument according to Claim 3, wherein the crest of 
each tooth includes a channel therein running parallel to the direction of the row, all of 

the channels in each row being aligned so as to define at their bases a substantially 
straight passageway for the transit of a thread-pulling needle through all of the teeth 

in the row, the base of each channel being sufficiently close to the base of the tooth 
that a needle forced through the passageway when said jaws are clamped across the 

tissue can run through only the wall of the wave of tissue contacting and overlying the 
crest of each tooth without penetrating the next adjacent wall of the tissue. 
A surgical suturing instrument according to Claim 1, wherein said actuating 
means includes a lost motion linkage having a lever pivotally connected to one of said 

jaws about a second pivot axis parallel to said first pivot axis, a link pivotally 
connected to said lever and a driving rod pivotally connected to said link. 
A surgical suturing instrument according to Claim 1, further comprising 
needle cartridge means (22) for defining a needle guide, said cartridge means (22) 

including an elongated body formed with two substantially parallel guideways for 
receiving first and second surgical needles (20) for sliding movement therein, and an 

open channel joining said guideway throughout their length. 
A surgical suturing instrument according to Claim 1, further comprising 
sealing means for providing a airtight seal within a cannula receiving the suturing 

instrument.
