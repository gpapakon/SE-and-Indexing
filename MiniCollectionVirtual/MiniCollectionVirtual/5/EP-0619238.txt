There is disclosed a pallet comprising a first sheet member (10) and a second 
sheet member (12), and a plurality of spacer elements (40) between the sheet 

members (10,12), characterised by the sheet members (10,12) and spacer 
elements (40) each having complementary locking means which comprise 

interengageable tongues (18) and slots (42) respectively carried by the members 
(10,12) or elements (40) and each tongue (18) comprising at least one flange (28) 

for securing the member (10,12) or element (40) on insertion through the slot

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a pallet in accordance with the preamble of claim 1 for supporting cargoes
during transportation shipment and storage.A pallet is an apparatus widely used to transport cargoes from one place to
another. The idea of a pallet is to facilitate cargo shipment or delivery in an
easy and safe manner. There is a wide range of pallets available with different
characteristics adapted to the type of cargoes to be transported. Pallets have
long been used for the transportation and storage of various merchandise.An example of a prior art pallet can be found in US-A-3763791
which discloses a pallet made from paper comprising two sheet members and a
plurality of spacer elements.According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided a pallet
comprising a first sheet member and a second sheet member, said sheet members
having their planes substantially parallel, and a plurality of spacer elements
between the sheet members, the sheet members and spacer elements being held 
together by complementary locking means which comprise interengageable
tongues and slots characterised in that the tongues are integral with and hingedly
attached to the sheet 
members and the slots are formed in the spacer elements and each tongue
comprises a body portion hingedly attached to the sheet member and at least one
flange portion hingedly attached to said body portion and inserted through a slot
to retain the tongue in the slot.It is preferred that at least a part of the flange is substantially wider than the
slot, and that the flange comprises at least one ear within the plane of the
tongue. The flange may be in the form of any geometric shape and preferably
will have a D-shape. Each tongue is preferably substantially rectangular.The tongues extend out of the plane of said sheet members and may be
arranged in pairs or in groups of four. The flanges of the tongues may extend
substantially towards each other or away from each other, and the tongues may
extend out of the plane of said sheet members in substantially the same direction
or in opposite directions. The slots in the spacer elements are preferably
substantially perpendicular to the sheet members or substantially parallel with the
sheet members and it is most preferred that they are parallel with one another.It is preferred that the spacer elements referred to hereinbefore further comprise
locating studs disposed to engage corresponding holes in said sheet elements. It is also preferred that either or both of the sheet elements further comprise
hinge
