<CLAIMS>
A locking-in grid (1) for livestock sheds, for locking in the
animal at the neck in the eating position in its stall, wherein the

locking-in grid besides a frame which has at least one continuous
horizontal tube (3, 3') and fixed vertical tubes (4) which serve in each

stall as a co-operating holder, has for each stall a pivotably mounted
retainer tube (6), the retainer tube (6) projects in its open position

into the free space relative to the co-operating holder and the
mounting axes of the retainer tube (6) extend perpendicularly to the

plane of the locking-in grid (1), and at least one control bar (7) for
actuation of the locking-in grid, the control bar being arranged in the

region of an upper horizontal tube (3) and extending over a plurality of
stalls,

   comprising for each stall a base tube (5) which is mounted
pivotably at the lower end and which is movable from a readiness

position into an open position and on which the retainer tube (6) is
mounted, wherein the mounting of the retainer tube (6) on the base tube

(5) is above the end of the retainer tube (6), which projects inclinedly
into the free space relative to the co-operating holder,


the locking-in grid (1) has only one control bar (7),
the upper ends of the retainer tubes (6) are guided displaceably
along the upper transverse tube (3) by means of guide elements,
arranged in the path of movement of the retainer tube (6) between
the open and closed positions thereof is a protrusion (8) which holds

the retainer tube (6) in the closed position, and
the retainer tube (6) surmounts the protrusion (8) in a direction
towards its open position by movement of the control bar (7),

   characterised in that
the control bar (7) is hingedly connected to the upper ends of
the base tubes (5), and
the protrusion (8) is surmounted by the retainer tube (6) in a
direction towards the open position thereof by virtue of the movement of

the base tube (5) from its readiness position into its open position.
A locking-in grid according to claim 1 characterised in that the
protrusion (8) is disposed in the path of movement of the lower end (9)

of the retainer tube (6), the retainer tube (6) is of a variable-length
construction beneath the mounting (10) on the base tube (5) and the

lower end (11) of the base tube (5) has on the side of the retainer tube
(6) a projection (12) on which the end surface of the lower end (9) of

the retainer tube (6) can rest in the parallel position of the base tube
(5) and the retainer tube (6).
A locking-in grid according to one of the preceding claims
characterised in that arranged longitudinally displaceably in the lower

end (9) of the retainer tube (6) is an inner tube (15) which can project
from the lower end (9) of the retainer tube (6).
A locking-in grid according to one of the preceding claims
characterised in that the lower end (16) of the inner tube (15) is at

least partially bevelled outwardly and downwardly from the base tube (5)
and the projection (12) on the base tube (5) is of a similar

configuration so that the movement by which the end surface (17) of the
inner tube (5) slides off the projection (12) is facilitated.
A locking-in grid according to claim 1 characterised in that the
protrusion (8) is provided in the path of movement of the upper end of

the retainer tube (6) on the control bar (7) and a locking element of
the retainer tube (6), which cooperates with the protrusion (8), is

movable in such a way that it can pass over the protrusion and latch
therebehind when the base tube (5) is in the readiness position and that

it is so limited downwardly by an abutment (21) relative to the retainer
tube (6) that in the open position it is outside the region of action of

the protrusion (8).
A locking-in grid according to claim 5 characterised in that the
protrusion (8) is provided on the top side of the control bar (7) and

the locking element is a transverse pin (22) in slots (23), wherein the 
slots (23) are provided in the limbs of the U-shaped fork (18) of the

retainer tube (6), and the transverse pin (22) is displaceable in the
substantially perpendicularly extending slot (23) and the lower end of

the slot (23) serves as the abutment (21).
A locking-in grid according to one of claims 5 and 6
characterised in that the protrusion (8) is provided on the top side of

the control bar (7) and the locking element is a flap (24) which is

mounted pivotably in the U-shaped fork (18) of the retainer tube (6) and
which bears substantially horizontally against the protrusion (8) and a

support (21') for the flap (24) with respect to the U-shaped fork (18)
serves as the abutment (21).
A locking-in grid according to claim 7 characterised in that the
locking-in grid (1) includes a locking bar (27) which can be inserted

between the locking-in grid (1) and the retainer tube (6) in the closed
position so that the retainer tube (6) cannot be moved into the open

position.
A locking-in grid according to claim 8 characterised in that an

to the rear end of which is fixed a U-shaped member (28) which can be
applied to the upper transverse tube (3) adjoining the open abutment

(26) and from which the flat bar member (27) extends inclinedly upwardly
to the retainer tube (6) and provided in the front end of the flat bar

member from below is a slot (29) in which the transverse pin (22) or the
axis member (30) of the flap (24) engage and can thus hold the retainer

tube (6) in the closed position in spite of the open position of the
base tube (5). 
A locking-in grid according to one of claims 1 or 5 to 10

region of the mounting (10) towards the retainer tube (6).
A locking-in grid according to one of claims 1 or 5 to 11

mounting (13) on a sleeve (14) and the sleeve (14) is slidable and

fixable over the lower transverse tube (3') of the frame (2) and carries
the protrusion (8).
A locking-in grid according to one of the preceding claims
characterised in that the upper end of the base tube (5) is cranked

(5) from its open position into its readiness position the retainer tube

(6) remains in its open position and the upper ends of the retainer tube
(6) and the base tube (5) extend in approximately parallel relationship.
A locking-in grid according to one of the preceding claims
characterised in that in the open position the centre of gravity of the
