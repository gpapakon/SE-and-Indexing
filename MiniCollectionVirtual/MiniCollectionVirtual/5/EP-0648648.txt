<ABSTRACT>
A construction for an invisible seam air bag deployment door 
installation in which foam layer wells (38,40) extend along the hinging 

side of each door panel (26,28) to freely allow hinging movement of the 
door panels by ready compression of the foam (24A) in the foam wells, 

preventing outward extension of the doors during opening under low 
temperature conditions. The compression of the foam in the wells 

also prevents fragmentation of the skin (22) and foam (24A).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns air bag safety systems and more 
Particularly a deployment door installation for forming an air bag 
deployment opening through an interior trim piece at the time of 
initiation of activation of the air bag system to allow the air bag 
to be deployed within the passenger compartment as it is inflated. Air bags are normally stored in a folded condition in a 
receptacle or canister mounted behind a section of the interior 
trim, i.e, typically behind the instrument panel for a passenger 
side front seat air bag installation. A steering wheel cover is 
often employed as the interior trim piece behind which the air bag 
is stored. The deployment opening has commonly been provided by one or 
more deployment door panels fit into an opening within the interior 
trim. The deployment doors are hinged along one side and to swing 
open by pressure exerted by inflation of the air bag. See U.S. 
patent no. 4,893,833 issued on January 16, 1990, for a "Closure 
for an Air Bag Deployment Opening" and U.S. patent no. 4,989,896 
issued on February 5, 1991, for a "Double Door Closure for an Air 
Bag Deployment Opening" for examples of such deployment door 
installations. In these designs, the deployment doors are formed of a 
separate panel from the interior trim piece in which the door is 
fit and thus is readily visible to an occupant of the vehicle. There has been heretofore proposed various designs for a so 
called "invisible seam" deployment door installation in which the 
outline of the deployment door or door is not visibly delineated in 
any way to the vehicle occupant, so as to not encourage tampering 
also to lessen any apprehension created by the conspicuous presence 
of the air bag. See for examples, U.S. patent no. 5,080,393 issued on January 
14, 1992, for a "Method and Apparatus for Forming an Air Bag 
Deployment Opening"; U.S. patent no. 5,217,244 issued on June 8, 
1993, for "Arrangement for Forming an Air Bag Deployment Opening";  
 
U.S. patent no. 5,082,310 issued on January 21, 1992, illustrates 
both an invisible seam and conventional deployment door design in 
respective embodiments shown therein. In such invisible seam deployment door installations, the 
general arrangement heretofore proposed has included a trim piece 
substrate having an opening formed therein, with a one or more 
deployment door substrate panels fit within the trim piece 
substrate opening, each door panel hinged along one side. Both the 
trim and door panel substrates are overlain by a layer of molded 
fo

<CLAIMS>
A construction for an air bag deployment door installation 
in an instrument panel for a passenger compartment of a passenger 

vehicle, said instrument panel adjacent a vehicle windshield, said 
installation comprising an instrument panel substrate member having 

an opening and one or more deployment door substrate panels fit 
into said opening at the top of said instrument panel, each of said 

one or more door substrate panels hinged along a side adjacent said 
instrument panel substrate to be able to be swung open about a 

hinging axis to form said air bag deployment opening, one of said 
door substrate panels swinging toward said windshield, a foam layer 

covering both said instrument panel and said one or more door 
substrate panels, and a decorative covering layer overlying said 

foam layer, a foam well comprised of a region of substantially 
thicker depth of foam overlying said instrument panel substrate 

extending along and immediately adjacent said hinging side of said 
one door substrate panel. 
The construction according to claim 1 wherein the depth of 
foam in said foam well is at least twice the depth of the depth of 

said foam layer over said door substrate panel. 
The construction according to claim 1 wherein the depth of 
foam in said foam well is at least four times the depth of said 

foam layer over said door substrate panel. 
The construction according to any one of claims 1 to 3 
wherein said one or more substrate door panels are hinged by means 

of a curved segment of said substrate door panel extending along 
said hinged side and turned inwardly and attached to said instrument 

panel substrate along said deployment opening. 
The construction according to any one of the foregoing claims 
wherein one deployment door substrate panel is hinged along a side 

thereof extending along the forward part of said instrument panel behind 
said windshield, said foam well formed by a downward extending 

contour of said instrument panel substrate adjacent said deployment 
opening creating a foam layer of greater depth below said overlying 

covering layer than the depth of said foam layer over said 
 

deployment door substrate panel and other regions of said 
instrument panel substrate. 
The construction according to claim 5 wherein two 
deployment door substrate panels are provided in the top of said 

instrument panel joined together along a line extending parallel to 
said hinging axis of said one deployment door substrate panel 

behind said windshield, the other deployment door substrate panel 
hinged along a side parallel thereto, and another foam well 

extending rearward of said hinging side of said other deployment 
door substrate panel, said another foam well comprised of a 

downwardly extending contour of said instrument panel adjacent said 
deployment opening forming a space below said overlying covering 

layer substantially greater depth than average depth of said foam 
layer overlying said deployment door substrate panels and other 

regions of said instrument panel. 
The construction according to claim 6 wherein said foam 
wells are of a depth of at least four times said average depth of 

said foam layer over said deployment door substrate panels.
