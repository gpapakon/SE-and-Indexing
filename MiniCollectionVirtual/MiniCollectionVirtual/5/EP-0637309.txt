<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to new compounds useful
as metal coatings to render metal surfaces biocompatible, a
process for their preparation, and their use in rendering a
metal surface biocompatible.The clinical use of blood contacting devices
and prostheses is of major importance today in
cardiovascular surgery and other fields of medicine. Heart
valves and blood vessel prostheses, balloon pumps and
catheters are being implanted in daily surgical practice to
restore or diagnose cardiovascular function. Artificial
organs are routinely employed in blood detoxification by
absorptive haemoperfusion and in oxygenation (membrane
oxygenators and heart-lung devices). Considerable effort
and capital is invested in Europe and the U.S.A. in the
development and experimental evolution of an implantable
artificial heart system. The devices are commonly
constructed from metals and, when in use, a blood-metal
contact is present. This contact will cause a reaction in
the recirculating blood, which, depending on the choice of
metal, the design parameters, the flow or the addition of
the anticoagulants, may lead to protein deposition,
adhesion and destruction of red blood cells (haemolysis),
platelet (thrombocyte) adhesion and aggregation and blood
coagulation leading to formation of a haemostatic plug
(thrombus). The occurrence of thromboembolism in
cardiovascular surgery continues to be a problem,
notwithstanding routine treatment with anticoagulants. For
these reasons the search for biocompatible non-thrombogenic 
materials has been an important research objective over
the last two decades.In addition, certain diagnostic procedures
designed for the rapid analysis of analytes in body
fluids are compromised by non-specifc binding of fluid
components. This problem is particularly acute in
biosensors which use parameters such as the mass or the
refractive index of the analyte to determine analyte
concentration. For instance, small changes in refractive
index associated with the binding of body fluid
components to a metal film can be measured using surface
plasmon resonance (SPR).We have now devised new compounds which aim to
mimic some of the interfacial characteristics of the
outer cell surface of for example red blood cells, and in
particular the lipid component of the biological membrane
which is the simplest common factor of such surfaces.
The compounds are derivatives or analogues of
phosphorylcholine that can be linked to the metal surface
which is to be rendered biocompatible via a thiol or
disulphide functional group
