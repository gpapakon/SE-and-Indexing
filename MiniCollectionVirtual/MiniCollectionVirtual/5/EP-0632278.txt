<ABSTRACT>
A supply voltage monitor for providing an indication 
of a supply voltage level considered safe for electronic 

circuit operation includes a supervisory or guard circuit that 
blocks the output of the monitor in favor of a secondary 

output for those periods of time when the monitor is 
considered to not be able of providing a valid reflection of 

supply voltage status.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to circuits 
for monitoring a supply voltage to provide an indication of 
that the monitored voltage has reached a certain minimum value 
sufficient for operation of other electronic circuitry, or 
that the supply voltage has not dipped below that minimum. 
More particularly, the invention relates to an improved "power 
on" circuit capable of providing a valid indication of the 
state of a supply voltage during the initial stages of supply 
voltage application. Power on (PON) circuits are commonly used to provide 
an indication that a supply voltage is at or exceeds a certain 
minimum specified value. The indication allows electronic 
circuitry operating from the supply voltage to be held in an 
off (non-operating) condition until the supply voltage has 
reached a voltage level that ensures reliable operation of the 
electronic circuitry. Alternatively, the indication may be 
used to reset the electronic (e.g., digital) circuitry, 
allowing it to begin operation from a known state when the 
supply voltage is known to have achieved a voltage level 
sufficient for operation. A variety of PON circuits capable of performing the 
supervisory functions outlined above are available. 
Unfortunately, they are not capable of guaranteeing the 
validity of the indication of their supervisory operation 
until the supply voltage has reached at least some minimum 
voltage level (e.g., approximately 3 volts DC); that is, for 
a short period of time following application of power to an 
electronic system, while the supply voltage is building toward 
its specified voltage level (e.g., 5 volts), the PON circuit 
is unable to provide a valid reflection of the status of that 
supply voltage and may, in fact, indicate that a valid 
operating voltage level exists when, in fact, it does not.  In turn, an erroneous indication of a valid supply 
voltage, during this initial power-up, could cause a digital 
system, for example, to attempt operation to write incorrect 
and indeterminate data to a non-volatile memory. The problem 
would not be discovered until sometime later, manifesting 
itself in, perhaps, a system failure when the indeterminate 
data is attempted to be used. There have been attempts to add to commercially 
available PON circuits external guard circuits that couple the 
indication of the supply voltage to the operating electronic 
circuitry, inhibiting it until the supply voltage reaches a 
level at which the PON circuit can provide a valid reflection 
of the supply
