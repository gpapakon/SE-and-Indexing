<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for producing pin-finned
heat sinks having good heat-properties
that are manufactured by cold forging,
warm forging, hot forging or combinations of these methods with
alkali dissolution.Efforts to increase the level of integration in
semiconductor devices have progressed so remarkably that
devices have emerged today that consume power of 35 watts or
more per chip. In order to operate such high-power
semiconductor devices with high reliability, the heat generated
by the devices must be dissipated to the exterior in an
efficient manner. To this end, highly integrated semiconductor
devices are fitted with a heat sink having cooling fins.Heat sinks in common use today are of two types, one having
cooling fins of a channel type in which plane parallel plates
are arranged in a comb shape, and the other having cooling fins
of a tower type in which a plurality of disks are stacked in a
tower form. Both types of cooling fins are manufactured by a
machining method, so limitations on the thickness of the bite
used and difficulties in the processing of cuttings unavoidably
increases production costs.Inexpensive cooling fins of a channel type are produced by
hot extrusion, but with this method, the thickness and pitch of
the fins are limited to such an extent that only heat sinks
having poor dissipating characteristics can be produced.Many years ago, researchers took an interest in the
dissipating characteristics of pin-finned heat sinks,
especially their leading edge effects. Subsequently, several
reports were published on the manufacture of pin-finned heat
sinks by mold casting, machining, or even cold forging.
Although a considerable time has since passed, the production
of such pin-finned heat sinks has not yet met substantial
commercial success on an industrial scale.Mold casting and machining methods are incapable of 
producing the desired heat sinks with satisfactory efficiency.
On the other hand, with cold forging, it is difficult to assure
good cold forming, namely, effective plastic working.
Furthermore, whichever method is employed, the heat dissipating
characteristics of the resulting pin-finned heat sinks are no
better than those of the existing heat sinks in common use
today.In order to solve the aforementioned problems with the
production of pin-finned heat sinks by forging methods, and
particularly cold forging methods, and at the same time achieve
marked improvements in heat dissipating characteristics of pin-finned
heat sinks, the present inventors conducted
