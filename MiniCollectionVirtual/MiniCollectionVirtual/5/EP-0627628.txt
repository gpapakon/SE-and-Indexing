<ABSTRACT>
In clinical analyzers, it is known to move a 
stack of test elements into position for dispensing by 

a plunger. However, known mechanisms for dispensing 
these test elements tend to comprise a complicated 

series of linking arms which convert rotary motion 
into linear motion. Described herein is an improved 

plunger and driver mechanism in which a plunger (23, 
110, 112, 114, 116) is mounted in a housing (120). A 

spring (130) biases the plunger (23, 110, 112, 114, 
116) to project beyond the housing (120). A first 

sensor (104, 142) senses the initial movement of the 
housing (120) and plunger (23, 110, 112, 114, 116) 

toward the stack, and a second sensor (132, 134, 136) 
senses movement of the plunger (23, 110, 112, 114, 

116) against the action of the spring (130) back into 
the housing (120) upon contact with the stack.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved
plunger and driver mechanism for advancing a stack of
test elements located in an analyzer to a dispensing
location for receiving patient samples.In clinical analyzers for assaying patient
sample liquids, it is conventional to provide a stack
of test elements from a depositor, each element of
which is used to receive a portion of a patient sample
liquid to do the assay. Such a stack features a
plunger and a driver for the plunger, which press
against one end of the stack to move its opposite end
to a location to dispense of the test element into the
analyzer. Means are also associated with the plunger,
such as a bar code, for counting how far the plunger
has moved, and hence how many test elements have been
dispensed.An example of such an arrangement is known
from the slide cartridges and plungers therefor used
in "Ektachem"® analyzers, for example, the "E250"
analyzer. In such a case, a driver for the plunger
comprises a complicated series of linking arms which
pivot to convert rotary motion from a DC motor into
what is almost linear motion of the plunger. A spring
appropriately connected at one of the pivot points
ensures an almost constant biasing force on the
plunger.Although such a mechanism has worked
satisfactorily, it is less than ideal for several
reasons. One is that its very complexity and large
number of moving parts produces a low reliability.
Another is all those parts lead to extra manufacturing
costs. Still further, tolerance errors in all those
parts can add up and thus lead to a departure from the
desired "constant force" delivered by the plunger, or
its desired linear movement. Finally, the linkage of 
the drive mechanism can produce vibrations which,
because counting is via a bar code, produces a false
count.It is therefore an object of the present
invention is to provide a simplified, truly linear
drive to a plunger which contacts and pushes a stack
of test elements, to more positively control the force
exerted against the stack as well as the "count" that
the mechanism measures of the remaining elements in
the stack.In accordance with the present invention, a
plunger and drive mechanism for an analyzer which
overcomes the above-noted problems is provided.More specifically, in accordance with one
aspect of the present invention, there is provided an
analyzer for detecting analytes in a patient liquid
deposited on to a test element, the analyzer
comprising:-
a source of test elements arranged in a
stack;a plunger mechanism for moving the

in a patient liquid deposited on to a test element (E,

E'; W; W'), the analyzer comprising:-

a source (C; 260) of test elements (E, E';
W, W') arranged in a stack;
