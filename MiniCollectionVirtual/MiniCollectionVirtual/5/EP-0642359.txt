<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to microencapsulated fragrance 
samplers. More particularly, this invention relates to 
microencapsulated fragrances bound to a sheet. Fragrance samplers comprising a microencapsulated fragrance 
and at least one binder layer between two surfaces are well known 
in the industry. These samplers have become a common vehicle for 
advertising perfumes and other fragrances through inserts in 
magazines and the like. Microencapsulated fragrance is typically 
provided as a laminate on one side of multi-colored, printed 
paper. In a market that places a premium on appearance, the 
samplers of the prior art are deficient in that the area of the 
advertisement page that bears the microencapsulated fragrance is 
not printed with ink to match the rest of the device. This is 
because solvent-containing microcapsules cannot be coated easily 
onto water-borne inks commonly used in the printing industry. 
Fragrance microcapsules are usually coated from water-borne 
slurries that would adversely affect the underlying print quality. 
When the microcapsules are delivered from an organic solvent 
slurry, the selection of capsule fill and ink on the paper is 
limited. For environmental reasons, it is undesirable to deliver 
the microcapsules from an organic solvent due to the amount of 
volatile organic components that would be necessarily released. 
Although organic solvent-borne inks may be substituted for the 
water-borne inks, problems will occur when the fragrance is 
actually sampled by the consumer. Specifically, when the consumer 
applies finger pressure to collect the microcapsules, some of the 
microcapsules will rupture and release the fragrance oil (the 
organic liquid fill that is in the capsule, hereinafter, organic 
liquid capsule fill), which in turn will attack the underlying 
ink. The ink will then smear on the paper or actually transfer 
ink to the finger of the consumer. Problems with ink smear may 
also occur in fragrance samplers having microcapsules that are 
tightly bound to the paper, so called pull-apart or burst  
 
fragrance samplers, because the oils released upon fracture of the 
microcapsules may attack the ink and cause bleeding even though 
not physically wiped. Inks may also be adversely affected if 
there is capsule leakage even without separate wiping. The blank 
area on the page required to avoid having ink directly under the 
microcapsules renders a significant portion of the piece 
unavailable for advertising copy, and also often results in a 
harsh visual

<CLAIMS>
A sampler for delivery of microencapsulated liquid 
material comprising 


a) a substrate sheet; 
b) ink disposed on at least a portion of the substrate 
sheet; 
c) a protective treatment disposed on the substrate sheet 
and overlying at least a portion of the ink, wherein said 

protective treatment is water-stable and organic liquid capsule 
fill-stable; and 
d) microcapsules comprising microencapsulated organic 
liquid capsule fill disposed on at least a portion of the 

protective treatment and overlying at least a portion of the ink. 
A sampler according to claim 1, wherein said substrate 
sheet is paper. 
A sampler according to claim 1, wherein said protective 
treatment is a crosslinked polymer. 
A sampler according to claim 1, further comprising a 
cover sheet over said microcapsules. 
A sampler according to claim 4, wherein said cover sheet 
is paper. 
A sampler according to claim 1, wherein said 
microcapsules are adhered to said protective treatment by a binder 

material. 
A sampler according to claim 1, wherein said protective 
treatment is provided at a treatment weight between 0,0075 N/m
2
 (0.2 lb/1300 sq. 
ft.) and 0,1485 N/m
2
 (4 lb/1300 sq. ft). 
A sampler according to claim 1, wherein said protective 
treatment is a crosslinked polyvinyl alcohol polymer.  

 
A sampler according to claim 1, wherein said organic 
liquid capsule fill is a fragrance oil. 
A method of making a sampler according to claim 1, 
comprising 


a) printing a substrate sheet with ink, 
b) applying a protective treatment to said substrate sheet 
and overlying at least a portion of said ink, 
c) allowing said protective treatment to cure to a state so 
that it is water-stable and organic liquid capsule fill-stable, 
d) applying microcapsules to said substrate sheet such that 
they are disposed on at least a portion of the protective 

treatment and overlying at least a portion of the ink. 
The method of claim 10, wherein said substrate sheet is 
paper. 
A method of making a sampler according to claim 10, 
wherein said microcapsules are applied to said substrate sheet in 

a slurry of binder and microcapsules. 
A method of making a sampler according to claim 12, 
further comprising the step of 


e) adhering a cover sheet over said dried slurry. 
The method of claim 13, wherein said cover sheet is 
paper. 
A method of making a sampler according to claim 2, 
comprising 


a) printing a substrate sheet with oil soluble printing ink; 
b) drying said ink in a first oven; 
c) applying a protective treatment to said substrate sheet 
and overlying at least a portion of said ink; 
d) allowing said protective treatment to crosslink; 
e) applying a slurry of binder and microcapsules such that 
the slurry is disposed on at least a portion of the protective 

treatment and overlying at least a portion of the ink; 
f) adhering a cover sheet over said slurry.
