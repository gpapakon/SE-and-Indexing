<ABSTRACT>
A voltage drop circuit to be built in a high 
integrated IC chip, including a voltage divider (10a) and a voltage 

comparator (11). A divided output voltage V
INT
 of the voltage 
divider and a comparison reference voltage V
REF
 are applied 
to respective input terminals (-) and (+) of the voltage 

comparator. An output signal of the voltage comparator (SG11) is 
supplied to a control signal generator (10b) section of the voltage 

divider (10a) to generate control pulses (₁,₂) 
and to control the 

connection of capacitors of a voltage divider section of the 
voltage divider by the control pulses to supply the divided 

output voltage V
INT
 to a load circuit (Z). In this case, the 
capacitors are used as a voltage dividing member for 

generating a voltage for an internal circuit from an external 
power source voltage. Thus, a power loss can be reduced and 

utilization efficiency of the capacitors is raised. Hence, 
the voltage drop circuit is suitable for high integrated IC 

chip.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a voltage drop 
circuit including a voltage divider circuit by using 
capacitors, and more particularly to a voltage drop circuit of 
a low consumption power type of this kind suitable to be 
built in a large capacity semiconductor dynamic random access 
memory (DRAM) chip. A semiconductor IC chip such as a large capacity DRAM 
or a built-in voltage drop circuit for dropping a power 
source voltage from outside so as to operate internal 
circuits such as a memory cell array at a low voltage. A 
typical example of a voltage drop circuit of this kind in the 
prior art has a structure of a so-called series regulator 
configuration, as disclosed in a paper of the IEEE Journal of 
Solid-state Circuits, Vol. 25, No. 4, pp. 903-911, 1990. This conventional voltage drop circuit 120 is 
provided with a voltage comparator 121 and a p-type FET 
(field effect transistor) 122 to input an output of the 
voltage comparator 121 at its gate electrode, as shown in Fig. 
1. A comparison reference voltage VREF is applied to one 
input terminal (-) of the voltage comparator 121 and a power 
source voltage VDD is supplied to the source electrode of 
the FET 122 via a power source terminal 124. And a voltage 
VINT output from the drain electrode of the FET 122 is fed to 
another input terminal (+) of the voltage comparator 121 and 
an output terminal 125.  
 Between the output terminal 125 and an earth voltage 
point, a load circuit Z such as a memory circuit of the 
aforementioned semiconductor IC chip with a built-in voltage 
drop circuit 120 is connected. By applying the comparison 
reference voltage VREF and the output voltage VINT to the 
respective input terminals (-) and (+) of the voltage 
comparator 121, it is controlled so that a current flowing in 
the FET 122 may increase when the output voltage VINT drops 
rather than the comparison reference voltage VREF, so as to 
obtain a low voltage supply circuit to the load circuit Z. Another example of a conventional voltage drop 
circuit is disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. Sho 63-121467, 
as shown in Fig. 2. In this case, as shown in Fig. 2, 
the voltage drop circuit 130 has the above-described series 
regulator configuration. That is, in addition to a 
combination of a comparator circuit 131 and an output FET 132 
for inputting its output at the gate electrode, there is 
provided a capacitor voltage divider circuit 134 inserted 
between a power source terminal 135 of a power source voltage 
VDD1 and the source electrode of the
