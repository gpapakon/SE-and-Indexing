<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a DC voltage supply, which is connected to a voltage source (U1), of an electronic ballast having a sinusoidal input current, the inrush current and the overvoltage are limited by a circuit arrangement. In this case, the voltage profile of the voltage source (U1) corresponds to a DC voltage or to a rectified mains voltage. During the switching-on (connection) process, an electronic switch (S1) which is provided in the circuit arrangement switches on and off periodically, or switches on at the zero crossing of the rectified mains voltage. If an overvoltage occurs on the voltage source (U1), the switch (S1) is opened again in order to protect the capacitor (C) and the output stage of the electronic ballast.

Circuit for limiting the inrush current 
and overvoltages of a DC power supply (L, D2, C, S2, R) 

of an electronic ballast comprising an electronic switch 
(S1) in series to the DC power supply and a driver circuit 

for opening and closing the switch (S1), wherein the 
driver circuit comprises a threshold voltage monitor 

(ZD1, T4) and a control point connected over a resistor 
to one pole (1) of a voltage source (U1), wherein the 

switch (S1) is connected to the DC voltage supply by 
means 
of a first terminal (3), the driver circuit comprises 
a measuring terminal connected to the one pole (1) 

of the voltage source (U1), the switch (S1) is connected 
with a second terminal to the other pole (4) of the voltage 

source (U1), and a control voltage between the control 
point and the other pole (4) of the voltage source 

can be monitored by the threshold voltage monitor (ZD1, 
T4), characterised in that the control point is connected 

over a third resistor (R7) to the other pole (4) of the 
voltage source and the first terminal (3) of the switch 

such that an opening of the closed switch (S1) is caused 
at a higher voltage (Ulaus) than a closing (Ulein) of the 

opened switch (S1). 
Circuit of claim 1 characterised in that 
the threshold voltage monitor (ZD1, T4) comprises at 

least one Zener diode (ZD1), the blocking voltage of 
which defines a threshold voltage, and that the current 

running through the Zener diode during overvoltage causes 
an opening of the switch (S1). 
Circuit of claim 2 characterised in that 
the Zener diode (ZD1) is connected to the base of a transistor 

(T4), by the activation of which transistor a control 
voltage of the switch (S1) is reduced.  

 
Circuit of claim 3 characterised in that a 
thyristor circuit (T1, T2) is arranged parallel to the 

transistor (T4), which fires upon occurrence of an overcurrent 
(I1max). 
Circuit of one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that the electronic switch S1 consists 

of an n-channel field effect transistor or an IGBT.
