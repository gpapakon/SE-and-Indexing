<ABSTRACT>
The apparatus is produced by the application of an alternator having a first rotor with permanent magnets and a second homopolar rotor, the two rotors being arranged in a common stator including a power winding surrounding the two rotors and an excitation coil arranged facing the homopolar rotor, an application in which the said alternator (5) is linked in rotation to the said turbine (1), the power winding being capable of being connected either to the load (7) when the turbine reaches a self-sustaining speed, or to a power supply (9) via a servo-control circuit (10) for carrying out the starting of the turbine from its zero speed up to a self-sustaining speed.
