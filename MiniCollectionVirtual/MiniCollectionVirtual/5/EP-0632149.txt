<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
manufacturing a slenderized animal wool by drawing.A synthetic fiber is slenderized by drawing after
it has been spun out. The primary object of this drawing
is not only to make the fiber finer but to improve its
strength through orientation of its molecules. The fibers
spun out are continuous, thus easy to draw.Recently, with diversification of fashion,
demands for clothing using fine animal wools are expanding.
However, it has heretofore been inevitable to rely on
natural raw materials for supply of fine fiber animal
wools. Such fine fiber animal wools are very high priced,
their output being extremely small. The finer the wools,
the higher the price. Techniques which enable their supply at
low prices have been sought.For slenderizing natural animal wools, for
example, dissolving the surface of the animal wool or
drawing the animal wool may be contemplated. The former
approach is limited in thinning the fiber for the
possibility of substantially impairing the hand,
characteristics or strength of the animal wool and
therefore may be used only in special cases. On the other hand, with regard to the latter
approach, animal wools are different from synthetic fibers,
the mean fiber length of Merino wool, for example, being
normally 50 - 90 mm, such that their drawing on industrial
scale has been quite out of consideration. In fact, since
animal wools themselves have practically useful strengths,
attempts to draw animal wools have never been made until
now. Academic studies on complex changes that are induced
when wool is drawn are available (e.g. Journal of the
Textile Institute, Vol. 55, (1964-6) 324-332, WOOL SCIENCE
REVIEW No. 15 (1956) 39 - 50, Education Department I.W.S.)
but they have nothing to do with the techniques for
providing slenderized animal wools on industrial scale.
Nor are known any techniques for setting the slenderized
animal wools in that state.WO 91/02835 discloses a method for stretching an assembly, e.g.
sliver or roving, of untwisted staple fibres to reduce their
diameter and increase their length employing false twist to
provide grip between the fibres to ensure that stretching of the
fibres and not drafting of the assembly occurs. The fibres are
first plasticized by treatment with a suitable agent in a bath
and then passed through apparatur which employs a number of
rotatable arrays of driven pulleys. The
arrays are mounted for rotation between two twist blocking nips
and are rotatable about a longitudinal axis
corresponding to the

A method of manufacturing a slenderized animal
wool fiber having its fiber axis paralleled,

comprising the steps of

(A) drawing a wetted sliver of the animal wool by
means of a plurality of drawing rollers, and then
(B) setting the drawn sliver with heat while the
sliver continues to be drawn by the plurality of

drawing rollers, wherein the drawing multiplicity
is in the range of from 1.4 to 2.2 times.
The method of claim 1, wherein the drawing
rollers comprise top rollers and bottom rollers.
The method of claim 1, wherein the heat is
provided in the form of steam.
The method of claim 2, wherein the bottom rollers
have a diameter of from 20 mm to 28 mm, and the

between-axis distance of the rollers is in the
range of from 22 to 32 mm.
The method of claim 2, wherein the surfaces of
the bottom rollers are provided with flutes, and

the surfaces of the top rollers are provided with
a rubber-like layer.
The method of claim 2, in which the diameters of
the top rollers are in the range of from 40 mm to

60 mm.
The method of claim 2, wherein the distance
between adjacent contacts between the top and 

bottom rollers is shorter than the length of the
animal wool fibers.
The method of claim 1, wherein pressure in the
range of from 20 kg to 300 kg is applied between

the top and bottom rollers.
The method of claim 1, wherein the drawing of the
sliver in step (A) is carried out at a temperature

in the range of from 40 °C to 100 °C.
The method of claim 1, wherein the sliver is
wetted by exposing the sliver to steam, or by

dipping the sliver in one or more liquids
selected from the group consisting of water, an

aqueous solution of a hydrogen bond breaking
agent, and a hydrophobic bond relaxer.
The method of claim 1, in which the wetting is
achieved in a liquid having a pH value in the

range of from 2.5 to 8.5.
The method of claim 1, further comprising before
step (A), the step of

(C) processing the sliver in a rotary gill to
spread and lengthen the sliver.
The method of claim 1, further comprising after
step (B), the step of

(D) treating the wool sliver with oxidizing
agents.
