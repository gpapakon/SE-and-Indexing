Heat exchanger with welded plates, comprising metal plates (1; 18, 19), pressed out in 
advance, joined in pairs by welding and forming stacked modular elements (12, 17) defining 

two independent circuits respectively for a first fluid and for a second fluid, all the plates (1; 
18, 19) connected so as to form an exchange block of rectangular section, being joined by 

welding to four parallel channels (16) disposed so as to correspond with the four comers of 
the said rectangular section, characterised in that the four comer channels (16) partially 

surround four respective vertical members (36) forming part of the frame of the exchanger, 
each vertical member (36) being produced in one or more pieces capable of sliding in the 

corresponding comer channel (16). 
Heat exchanger with welded plates according to Claim 1, characterised in that the stacked 
modular elements (12) of the exchange block are each prod
uced from two rectangular 
elementary plates (1), each having, at each of its four comers, a rectangular cut-out (2) having 

an opening (3) at its inside comer, the edges (5, 7) of each elementary plate (1) being folded 
(4, 6) at 90Â° altemately in one direction and the other in order to form four generators (10) to 

which are welded, respectively, the four comer channels (16). 
Heat exchanger with welded plates according to Claim 2, characterised in that protrusions 
(11) in the form of flat-based dishes are formed by pressing in the central region of the 

elementary plates (1), the respective pressed protrusions (11) of two elementary plates (1) 
placed opposite one another in order to form a modular element (12), being secured at their  

 
flat bases by a welding operation in order to join the two elementary plates (1) to one another. 
Heat exchanger with welded plates according to Claim 1, characterised in that the four 
comer channels (16) are divided into two pairs of channels, in each of which two channels 

(16) are connected to one another by means of a wall (24) in which parallel, transverse 
apertures (25) are formed, on the edges of which there are squeeze-welded elements (17) of a 

first circuit, which each consist of two elementary plates (18, 19) joined together by welding, 
whilst the free spaces between these circuit elements (17) define the second circuit of the 

exchanger. 
Heat exchanger with welded plates according to Claim 4, characterised in that each circuit 
element (17) consists of a flat elementary plate (18) and a second elementary plate (19) 

deformed by pressing, with two folded opposite ends (20) and a series of ribs (21) parallel to 
one another and to the folded edges (20), the two elementary plates (18, 19) being joined 

together by welding at the folded edges (20) and the tops of the ribs (21). 
Heat exchanger with welded plates according to any one of Claims 1 to 5, characterised in 
that the exchange block comprises a further two cruciform end plates (26, 27) which, in 

combination with the faces (28, 29) of the four comer channels (16), delimit four lateral 
distribution boxes (32, 33, 34, 35), with a first pair of opposite distribution boxes (32, 33) 

associated with the first circuit, and a second pair of opposite distribution boxes (34, 35) 
associated with the second circuit of the exchanger.  

 
Heat exchanger with welded plates according to any one of Claims 1 to 6, characterised in 
that the four vertical members (36) of its frame each have a square section and in that each 

comer channel (16), in the form of a profiled member whose section fits within a square, has 
two adjacent faces (28, 29) corresponding to an entire side of this square, and two other faces 

(30, 31) extending the preceding ones and corresponding to a fraction of the side of the said 
square. 
Heat exchanger with welded plates according to any one of Claims 1 to 7, characterised in 
that its frame has, in addition to the four vertical members (36), two end pedestals (37, 38) to 

which are joined the opposite ends of the vertical members (36), this frame being 
supplemented on its lateral faces by four removable doors (39, 40, 41, 42) fixed at their 

periphery, notably by screwing, against the portions of the vertical members (36) which are 
not covered by the comer channels (16), and against the edges of the two end pedestals (37, 

38). 
Heat exchanger with welded plates according to any one of Claims 1 to 8, characterised in 
that the two independent fluid circuits have a free passage and can be cleaned mechanically 

after the doors (39, 40, 41, 42) have been removed, each of the two circuits being suitable for 
having loaded fluids pass through them.
