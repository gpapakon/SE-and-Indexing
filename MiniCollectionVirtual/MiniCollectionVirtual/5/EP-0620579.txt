<ABSTRACT>
The adjusting device (114) includes a rotary drive knob (116) of a positioning stud (104) interacting with a ramp (102) of the control element (52), and a ring (124) equipped with means for selecting the angular position of an end-of-travel stop (126a), intended to limit the rotational movement of the knob (116) in order to determine a maximum trip threshold. The ring (124) is covered by a cover plate (148) having an aperture (152) for access to the head of the knob (116) for fine adjustment of the trip threshold. The diameter of the second aperture (152) is less than the outer diameter of the ring (124) in order to inhibit any alteration in position of the end-of-travel stop after the cover plate (148) is put in place.

A device for adjusting the tripping threshold of an electrical switchgear device, 
notably a multipole circuit breaker (10), having an insulating case (12) housing a 

mechanism (58) with latching (71) associated to mechanical tripping means (50, 56), 
and an electromagnetic trip device (44) arranged in each pole to release the latching 

(71) when the current exceeds a preset tripping threshold, said trip device 
comprising : 


a magnetic circuit (76) having a fixed core (80) and an excitation coil (78), 
a mobile plunger (82) coupled to an operating component (52) cooperating with the 
mechanical tripping means when the mobile plunger (82) is attracted against the fixed 

core (80), 
return means (96) biasing the mobile plunger (82) to a separated position in the 
opposite direction from the fixed core (80), with interposition of an air-gap (84) whose 

thickness determines said tripping threshold, 
means for adjusting the air-gap (84) by means of a rotary knob (116) for fine 
adjustment of the tripping threshold, 
and means for selecting the angular position of an end-of-travel stop (126a) 
designed to limit the rotational movement of the knob (116) to determine a maximum 

tripping threshold, 
 
characterized in that : 


a positioning stud (104) is driven by means of the rotary knob (116) to cooperate 
with a ramp (102) of the operating component (52), 
the end-of-travel stop (126a) is arranged on a protuberance (126) of an annular ring 
(124) surrounding the knob (116) coaxially, 
the ring (124) is covered, after adjustment of the end-of-travel stop (126a), by a 
cover plate (148) applied on the top panel (146) of the case (12), said cover plate  

 
comprising a first opening (150) for passage of the manual operating handle (62) of 

the mechanism (58), and a second opening (152) for access to the head of the fine 
tripping threshold adjustment knob (116), 
the diameter of the second opening (152) being smaller than the external diameter 
of the ring (124), in such a way that fitting of the cover plate (148) prevents any 

modification of the position of the end-of-travel stop (126a). 
The tripping threshold adjustment device according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the selection means comprise a locking lug (130) designed to engage between 

adjustment pins (132, 134, 136, 138, 140, 142) angularly located around an aperture 
(144) of the case (12). 
The tripping threshold adjustment device according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that the knob (116) comprises a spigot (128) coming into engagement against the 

stop (126a) when the maximum threshold is reached, and a pinion (120) cooperating 
with a crown-wheel (122) of an adjustment strip (112). 
The tripping threshold adjustment device according to claim 3, characterized in that 
the adjustment strip (112) is common to all the poles and extends parallel to the trip 

bar (50), that the positioning stud (104) of each trip device (44) is slidingly mounted 
along a first fixed spindle (106) parallel to the strip (112), and that said spindle (106) is 

supported by an extension (92) of the magnetic circuit (76). 
The tripping threshold adjustment device according to claim 4, characterized in that 
the positioning stud (104) is equipped with a screw (160) cooperating with the ramp 

(102) of the operating component (52) to provide pre-setting of the tripping, said 
screw (160) being accessible via an orifice (162) of the 
case (12). 
The tripping threshold adjustment device according to claim 4 or 5, characterized in 
that the positioning stud (104) is equipped with a drive part (108) designed to engage 

in an orifice (110) of the adjustment strip (112), and that the operating component 
(52) comprises an actuating lever (88) pivotally mounted on a second spindle (90) 

securedly united to the magnetic circuit (76), said second spindle (90) being parallel 
to the first spindle (106).  

 
The adjustment device according to claim 1, characterized in that the cover plate 
(148) comprises a plurality of markers A, B, C, D, E, F angularly located around the 

second opening (152) and the head (118) of the knob (116), each marker 
corresponding to a multiple of the rated current flowing in the circuit breaker.
