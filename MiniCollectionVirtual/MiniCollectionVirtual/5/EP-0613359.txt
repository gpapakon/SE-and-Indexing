<ABSTRACT>
An absorbent article having improved strikethrough, rewet characteristics, and feel is disclosed. The absorbent article has a topsheet comprising a nonwoven material (24) and apertured thermoplastic film (26). The apertured thermoplastic film is treated with a surfactant preferably by incorporating the surfactant into the resin used to make the thermoplastic film. The combination of the nonwoven material and the surfactant-treated apertured thermoplastic film permit liquids to rapidly penetrate the topsheet while preventing liquid in the absorbent core of the article from flowing back through the topsheet. The nonwoven material provides the topsheet with improved, less plastic-like feel.

<DESCRIPTION>
 ABSORBENT ARTICLE HAVING A NONWOVEN AND APERTURED FILM COVERSHEETFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to absorbent articles such as diapers, incontinent articles, sanitary napkins, and the like. More particularly, this invention relates to absorbent articles having a nonwoven and apertured film coversheet.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONAll manner and variety of absorbent articles configured for the absorption of body fluids are, of course, well known. Current types of absorbent articles include diapers, incontinent articles, and sanitary napkins.A major in use problem encountered with known absorbent articles is leakage of waste product which contaminates clothing articles that contact the absorbent article, such as pants, shirts, and bedding. The amount of leakage experienced by the wearer can be reduced by improving the rate at which the liquid enters the absorbent core. Thus, an absorbent article in which the liquid rapidly penetrates the topsheet and is contained in the absorbent core will experience less leakage than an absorbent article in which liquid is able to run across the topsheet before penetrating into the absorbent core. Reducing run-off, therefore, reduces the amount of leakage experienced with the absorbent article. 

 Another in-use problem associated with absorbent articles is the dryness of the skin contacting surface. Generally, the drier the skin contacting surface, the more comfortable the absorbent article. There have been several patents directed towards reducing the surface wetness in disposable diaper structures. U.S. Patent 3,945,386 issued to Anczurowski on March 23, 1976 and U.S. Patents 3,965,906 and 3,994,299 issued to Karami on June 29, 1976 and November 30, 1976, respectively, teach diaper structures having a perforated thermoplastic film interposed between the topsheet and the absorbent core. U.S. Patent 4,324,247 issued to Aziz on April 13, 1982 describes an effort directed to both reducing run-off and reducing the surface wetness of absorbent articles.Still another problem associated with absorbent articles is the feel of the skin contacting surface. A problem with utilizing formed films is that some consumers do not like the plastic feel associated with such films. A number of efforts have been directed at improving the feel of the surface of absorbent articles. One effort is described in U.S. Patent 3,967,623 issued to Butterworth, et al. The Butterworth patent is directed to an absorbent pad having a facing sheet comprising a perforated thermoplastic web

<CLAIMS>
 1. A liquid pervious topsheet for an absorbent article, said topsheet comprising a nonwoven material and an apertured plastic film placed together in a face-to-face relationship, characterized in that said film is treated with a surfactant to enhance the overall permeability of said topsheet.
2. The topsheet of Claim 1 wherein said film is comprised of a thermoplastic resinous material and said surfactant was mixed with said thermoplastic resinous material and incorporated into said film.
3. The topsheet of Claims 1 or 2 wherein said nonwoven material and said film are secured together.
4. The topsheet of Claim 3 wherein said nonwoven material and said film are adhesively bonded together.
5. The topsheet of Claim 3 wherein said nonwoven material and said film are fused together.
6. The topsheet of Claim 1 wherein said nonwoven fabric and said apertured film have been integrally formed into a composite structure.
7. The topsheet of Claim 1 wherein said nonwoven material is also treated with a surfactant.
8. A method of making a liquid pervious topsheet for an absorbent article, said method characterized in that it comprises the steps of:
(a) providing a nonwoven web; 


 (b) providing an apertured plastic film;
(c) treating said film with a surfactant;
(d) placing the nonwoven web and apertured film in a face-to-face relationship; and
(e) securing said nonwoven web and said film together.
9. The method of Claim 8 wherein:
said nonwoven web has a basis weight from about 1 to about 40 g/sq.m; and
the steps (b) and (c) comprise the steps of:
(i) providing a thermoplastic resinous material;
(ii) heating said thermoplastic material to a temperature above its melting point;
(iii) mixing a surfactant into said molten thermoplastic material;
(iv) forming the mixture of molten thermoplastic material and surfactant into said apertured film; and
(v) allowing said film to cool.
10. The method of Claim 8 wherein:
said nonwoven web has a basis weight from about 1 to about 40 g/sq.m; and
the steps (b) and (c) comprise the steps of: 


 (i) providing a thermoplastic resinous material;
(ii) heating said thermoplastic material to a temperature above its melting point;
(iii) mixing a surfactant into said molten thermoplastic material;
(iv) forming the mixture of molten thermoplastic material and surfactant into said apertured film; and
the step (d) comprises placing the nonwoven web and apertured film in a face-to-face relationship while said apertured film is sufficiently hot for the nonwoven web to bond to the hot apertured film.
