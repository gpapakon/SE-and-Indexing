<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid crystal 
material having at least two optically active carbon atoms 
in a tetralin ring and a hydrocarbon chain structure, 
to a liquid crystal composition comprising the liquid 
crystal material, to a liquid crystal element in which the 
liquid crystal material is used and to a carboxylic acid ester 
compound. Currently widely used display devices in which liquid 
crystal compounds are incorporated are usually driven by TN 
(twisted nematic) mode. When driving by TN mode is adopted, however, the 
positions of liquid crystal compound molecules in an 
element of the device must be altered in order to change a 
displayed image. As a result, there are involved such 
problems that the driving time of the device is prolonged, 
and the voltage required for altering positions of the 
liquid crystal compound molecules, i.e., power consumption, 
becomes large. Switching elements incorporating ferroelectric liquid 
crystal compounds, different from those in which TN mode or 
STN mode is utilized, can function only by altering the  
 
molecular orientation direction of the liquid crystal 
compounds, and hence the switching time is prominently 
shortened. Further, the value Ps x E obtained from a 
spontaneous polarization (Ps) of the ferroelectric liquid 
crystal compound and an intensity of the electric field (E) 
applied is an effective energy output for altering the 
molecular orientation direction of the liquid crystal 
compound, and accordingly the power consumption is also 
significantly diminished. Such ferroelectric liquid 
crystal compounds as mentioned above have two stable 
states, namely, bistability, in accordance with the 
direction of the applied electric field, and therefore 
have excellent switching threshold value characteristics. 
Accordingly, the ferroelectric liquid crystal compounds are 
particularly suitable for display devices for animations. When these ferroelectric liquid crystal compounds are 
used in, for example, optical switching elements, they are required 
to have characteristics such as an operating 
temperature in the vicinity of or not higher than room 
temperature, a wide operating temperature range, a high (quick) 
switching speed, and a switching threshold value 
voltage in an appropriate range. Of these characteristics, 
the operating temperature range is a particularly important 
property when the ferroelectric liquid crystal compounds 
are put into practical use. Known ferroelectric liquid crystal compounds 
have drawbacks such  
 
as
