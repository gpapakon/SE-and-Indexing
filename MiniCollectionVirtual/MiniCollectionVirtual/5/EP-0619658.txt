<ABSTRACT>
A signal light (101) and a clock light (102) 
which is generated by a clock light generator (11) are 

propagated through a non-linear optical medium (4) of, for 
instance, a silica-based single mode optical fiber, from 

which the signal and clock lights and a four-wave mixing 
light (103) are obtained. One light, for instance, the 

four-wave mixing light is extracted from the output lights 
of the non-linear optical medium, and a control signal which 

is dependent on a time-mean value in power of the extracted 
light is applied to a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) 

(10) for driving the clock light generator (11). Thus, a 
clock light which is locked in phase to the signal light is 

obtained. In case where the signal light comprises N time-division 
sequential lights (N = 1, 2, 3, -----), and a clock 

frequency of the clock light is 1/N of a clock frequency of 
the signal light, each one of the N time-division sequential 

lights is shifted in phase or frequency by the non-linear 
optical medium, so that the phase or frequency shifted 

sequential light is switched to be demultiplexed by a switch 
device such as an optical coupler and a polarization beam 

splitter.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus for
synchronizing an optical clock and an apparatus for
demultiplexing a time-division multiplexed signal, and more
particularly, to the timing synchronization and the
demultiplexing of a signal light carried out using four-wave
mixing light generated in a non-linear optical medium by the signal light and a clock
light.Clock synchronization is used to provide a
timing reference point for setting up
synchronism between a transmitter and a receiver, and
for correctly discriminating equalized signals.In known optical communication systems, such as those described below a
clock is obtained from an electric signal
converted from a light signal using an optical to
electric (O/E) converter.On pages 85 and 85 of "the technology for PCM
communication" published in August of 1976 by Sanpo Shuppan,
a self-timing extraction method is described. In this
method, an electric signal is obtained from a signal light,
coded in NRZ coding to be propagated via a transmission line,
by using an O/E converter; the clock component of the
electric signal is emphasized by a differential turn-back 
circuit, so that any unnecessary frequency components are
removed using a band-pass
filter to provide a clock signal having a high Q value.On pages 106 to 109 of the publication mentioned above,
a method which uses a phase locked oscillator is
described. In this method, a phase locked loop (PLL)
comprising a phase detection circuit, a low band-pass
filter, and a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) is used;
phase detection
between an input signal and the output
signal of the VCO is carried out in the phase detection circuit, and the output signal of the phase
detection circuit is supplied to the low band-pass filter to
be fed back to the VCO, so that a clock signal which is
synchronous with the input signal is obtainedOn pages 510 to 511 of "Electronics Letters, Vol.
28, No. 5, February, 1992", an optical signal processing
system is described which can process signals at high enough speeds
to cope with high speed optical
communication involving data transmission rates greater than 10Gb/s.
This system comprises a PLL circuit
which makes use of optical correlative detection in a
semiconductor optical amplifier. In this system, a pulse
coded signal light of a frequency f and a clock light
of a frequency (f + Δf) are supplied to the optical amplifier.
where in 
the gain of the signal light is modulated by the clock light
due to gain saturation in the amplifier. As a result, a
