<ABSTRACT>
A laminate capable of mounting semiconnductor elements 
thereon, comprising an insulating layer which is constituted 

by a resin portion of sea-island structure (2) and a woven 
reinforcement (1). The resin portion of sea-island 

structure (2) is, for example, such that a resin as islands 
(3) are dispersed in a resin as a matrix. Thus, the 

insulating layer exhibits a coefficient of thermal expansion 
of 3.0 ∼ 10 [ppm/K]
 in a planar direction thereof and a 
glass transition temperature of 150 ∼ 300 [°C]
. Owing to 
these physical properties, thermal stresses which the 

laminate undergoes in packaging the semiconductor elements 
thereon can be reduced, so that the connections of the 

laminate with the semiconductor elements can be made highly 
reliable.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a laminate and a 
multilayer printed circuit board on each of which 
semiconductor elements can be mounted. Multilayer substrates of low thermal expansibilities 
include a substrate having a ceramics core layer, a 
substrate with ceramics deposited on a copper foil by flame 
spraying, and so forth. The coefficients of thermal 
expansion of these substrates are 10 [ppm/K] or less in the 
planar directions thereof (in the direction of each 
substrate within the bonding surface thereof). The 
ceramics-based substrates, however, are problematic in 
their drillabilities in the case of forming through-holes. 
Meanwhile, regarding organic substance based substrates, it 
has been known that the coefficient of thermal expansion 
can be reduced by mixing an inorganic filler into a resin 
system. This contrivance, however, results in enlarging 
the elastic modulus of the substrate and is not always 
satisfactory for attaining lower stresses.  
 It has heretofore been known that a lower elastic 
modulus can be achieved by adding a rubber type component 
into the resin component of a laminate material (Japanese 
Patent Application Laid-open No. 100446/1986). In this 
case, a flexible substrate of excellent toughness is 
provided by rendering the resin and rubber type components 
miscible. This contrivance is really effective to reduce 
the elastic modulus of the substrate, but it tends to 
enlarge the thermal expansion coefficient thereof. It has also been known to apply to a laminate the 
combination of a matrix resin component and another resin 
component which exhibits an inferior miscibility with the 
matrix as represented by a so-called "sea-island structure" 
(a phase separation structure in which a continuous matrix 
contains another phase (dispersed islands) existing in an 
independent state. The island portion is dispersed porion, 
and the sea portion is contiuous matrix portion).  
 EP-A-0 581 314 discloses a resin composition of phase 
separation structure having enhanced fracture resistance. 
The resin composition comprises a curable dicyanate ester 
resin having dispersed therein at least one thermoplastic 
polymer. JP-A-2219853 dicloses a resin composition having an island 
structure made of an epoxy resin and a cured elastomer, and 
a prepreg containing the resin composition. As an elastomer, 
polyamides or the like are disclosed.  
 As a further 
example of such a laminate, there has been proposed a 
substrate in which a layer made of the resin components of 
the
