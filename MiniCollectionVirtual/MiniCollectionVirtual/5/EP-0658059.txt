<ABSTRACT>
The connecting and disconnecting block for terminal disconnection of a multiplicity of conductors (2, 3) of shielded cables (4, 5) for telecommunication and data communication comprises first means (6) for insulation-cutting-connection of the incoming conductors (2) and second means (7) for insulation-cutting-connection of the outgoing conductors or links (3), the block (1) being mountable in a support rack (8) and the shielding (4', 5') of the cables (4, 5) being connectable to the frame of the support rack. In this arrangement, a first earth connection part (10) is provided which can be inserted in the block (1) and has a protrusion (11) for supporting, attaching and contacting the shielding (4') of the incoming cable (4), with spring means (12) for contacting the support rack (8), with multiple protrusions (13) for contacting filler wires and with clamping means (14) for the clamping, contacting plugging-on of a second earth connection part (20) for accommodating and shielding contacting of the outgoing shielded cable (5).

Connecting and disconnecting block for separately
distributing a number of conductors (2, 3) of

shielded cables (4, 5) for telecommunications and
data communications, with primary means (6) for

the insulation-displacement connection of the
incoming conductors (2) and secondary means (7)

for the insulation-displacement connection of the
outgoing conductors or transitions (3), whereby

the strap (1) can be incorporated into a
supporting frame (8) and the screening (4', 5') of

the cables (4, 5) can be connected to the chassis
of the supporting frame, characterized in that a

first earth-connection part (10) that can be
plugged into the strap (1) and that has a

projection (11) for supporting, securing and
contacting the screening (4') of the incoming

cable (4), with sprung means (12) for contacting
the supporting frame (8), with multiple

projections (13) for contacting parallel wires,
and with clamping means (14) for the clamped

contacting insertion of a second earth-connection
part (20) for the acceptance and screened

contacting of the outgoing screened cables (5).
Connecting and disconnecting block in accordance
with claim 1, characterized in that the first

earth-connection part (10) is approximately T-shaped,
whereby the multiple projections (13)

project like the teeth of a comb from the crosstie
of the earth-connection part and the clamping

means (14) for the second earth-connection part
(20) are bent laterally upwards at the other tie.
Connecting and disconnecting block in accordance
with claim 1, characterized in that the second 

earth-connection part (20) is of nested form with
a first inner subdivision (21) for bringing the

screened outgoing cables (5) out laterally, with
sprung tongues (22) for contacting the screening

(5') of the outgoing cables (5), and with a second
inner subdivision (23) for bringing out the

individual outgoing conductors or transitions (3).
Connecting or disconnecting block in accordance
with claims 2 and 3, characterized in that the

second nested-form earth-connection part (20)
displays a lateral projection (24) whose flat

parts extend between the ties of the clamping
means (14) of the first earth-connection part

(10).
