<ABSTRACT>
An enclosure (10) for isolating a patient comprises an external 
frame (12) and a flexible envelope (14) suspended from and hanging within 

the frame. The envelope has a bottom (16), top (18), two sides (20, 22), 
front (24) and a rear (26) wall portions, one of the side or front wall 

portions being fitted with a closable entry means (32) allowing entry of the 
patient. There is an opening (46) in one of the wall portions fitted with an 

integral filter means (48) adapted to filter out infectious particles from the 
air and to cooperate with a pump means (50), and a valve means (36) 

allowing uni-directional air passage from the outside to the inside of the 
enclosure. The pump means draws air through said filter means which 

creates a negative pressure inside the enclosure, whereby air flows in the 
direction valve-enclosure-filter means ensuring that no contaminating agents 

will escape from within the enclosure to the outside.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is generally in the field of medical 
accessories and concerns a device intended for isolating a patient which has 
a contagious disease or is suspected of having such a disease. A major problem in hospitals, and particularly in emergency 
wards, is the risk of the medical personnel and patients, of contracting 
contagious diseases from other patients. Emergency wards generally have 
an open space architecture with curtains designed to isolate an area around 
the bed. The main purpose of such a curtain is to provide the patient and 
the treating personnel with some privacy, such curtains having very little, if 
any, effect in the physical isolation of the patient from the surrounding 
environment. Where a patient suffers from a contagious disease, particularly 
pulmonary diseases such as tuberculosis, he can easily infect the medical 
personnel as well as other patients in surrounding beds with the disease.  Enviro-Chamber™ (Medical Safety Products Incorporated, 
U.S.A.) is an enclosure intended to isolate a patient which has a frame and 
a flexible envelope hanging within the frame which forms a sort of a room 
within a room in which a patient, which is intended to be isolated, is placed. 
This enclosure has an entrance for a patient and has a small opening fitted 
with a filtration unit. The filtration unit continuously draws air through the 
opening which then passes through a filter inside the unit where the 
infectious particles in the drawn air are filtered-out. Such a negative 
ventilation system, reduces the risk of release of infectious particles to the 
surrounding environment. However, in accordance with the invention it has 
been realized that there are several major problems of a protection system 
such as the Enviro-Chamber™. For one, once the pump stops operating, e.g. 
in case of an electric power failure, or when disassembling the enclosure, 
infectious particles may be released to the environment through the opening. 
Additionally, the filter inside the filtration unit becomes, with time, 
dangerously contaminated and has to go through an intricate sequence of 
decontamination steps so as to minimize the hazards which may arise from 
contact therewith. It is an object of the present invention to provide a novel 
enclosure for isolating a patient in which the risk of infectious particles 
reaching the surrounding environment is almost entirely eliminated. Other objects of the invention will become clear from reading 
the following disclosure. The present invention

<CLAIMS>
An enclosure (10) for isolating a patient comprising: 

   an external frame (12); 
   flexible envelope (14) suspended from and hanging within the frame; 

the envelope having a bottom (16), top (18), two sides (20, 22), front (24) 
and a rear (26) wall portions, one of the side or front wall portions being 

fitted with a closable entry means (32) allowing entry of the patient; 
   an opening (46) in one of the wall portions fitted with an integral filter 

means (48) adapted to filter out infectious particles from the air and to 
cooperate with a pump means (50) so that air is drawn by the pump means 

from the enclosure through said filter means, creating a negative pressure 
inside the enclosure; and 

   valve means (36) allowing unidirectional air passage from the outside 
to the inside of the enclosure. 
An enclosure according to Claim 1, wherein said filter means 
comprises a filter body (52) and an integration means (54) which is integral 

with the filter body and which is attached to the peripheral portions (46) of 
said opening in a manner that avoids any air leak. 
An enclosure according to Claim 2, wherein the pump means has 
a casing having an aperture (58) of a size essentially that of the filter 

means (54), and comprising a pump (60) adapted to draw air through the 
aperture (58), and said integration means comprises attachment means being 

adapted to engage said aperture. 
An enclosure according to any one of the preceding claims, 
comprising an airlock screen (40) proximal said entry means (32), adapted 

to create an airlock space (41) between it and the entry means so as to 
minimize the risk of contamination when the entry means is opened. 
An enclosure according to Claim 4, wherein the valve means (36) 
is situated in a portion of the envelope (14) touching the airlock space (41). 
An enclosure according to any one of the preceding claims, 
wherein the valve means (34) is a flapper type valve. 
An enclosure according to any one of the preceding claims, 
wherein the filter means (50) is adapted to filter out particles larger than 

about 3 µm. 
A patient isolation system comprising an enclosure (10) according 
to any one of the preceding claims and pump means (50) adapted to draw 

air through said filter means creating a negative pressure inside the 
enclosure. 
A system according to Claim 8, wherein the pump means is 
supported on the frame of the enclosure.
