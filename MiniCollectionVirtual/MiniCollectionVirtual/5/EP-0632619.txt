<ABSTRACT>
A technique for modifying the IEEE 802.3 standard for selecting 
transmit-to-transmit interpacket gap (IPG) intervals in a Carrier Sense Multiple Access 

with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) network, to provide fairness and good channel 
utilization in the event that a node has captured the network communication channel. If 

there is a small number of active nodes on the network, one node may capture the 
channel and the standard backoff algorithm makes it increasingly unlikely for another 

node to transmit. The new technique provides for use of a longer interpacket gap (IPG) 
interval to be used by a node that has been initially unsuccessful in contention for the 

channel, thereby ensuring that the other node may continue to transmit back-to-back data 
packets without interrruption or collision. After a preselected time interval, the nodes 

reverse their roles by selecting the opposite IPG intervals. The initial receiver now 
selects the shorter IPG interval and captures the channel for the preselected time interval.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to local area networks (LANs) of the
Ethernet type and, more particularly, to techniques for improving fairness of channel
access in an Ethernet LAN. Ethernet is a commonly used name for a LAN that uses a
network access protocol referred to as Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision
Detection (CSMA/CD). The CSMA/CD protocol is defined in ANSI/IEEE Std 802.3,
published by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc., 345 East 45th
Street, New York, NY 10017, and referred to in this specification as "the IEEE 802.3
standard." The standard is for a 10 Mbs (megabits/sec) CSMA/CD channel, but it will
be understood that the present invention may also be applicable to a 100 Mbps channel.Under the CSMA/CD rules for access to a network bus or cable, which
will be referred to as the channel, any node or station wishing to transmit must first
"listen" to make sure that the channel is clear before beginning to transmit. All nodes on
the network have equal priority of access and may begin transmitting as soon as the
channel is clear ad a required inter-packet delay of 9.6 µs (microseconds) has elapsed.
However, if a first node that has started transmitting detects a "collision" with a
transmission from another node, the first node continues transmitting for a short time to
make sure that all nodes wishing to transmit will detect the collision. Every other node
detecting the collision also continues to transmit for a short time. Then each node that
has detected a collision terminates transmission of the packet or frame. The nodes
involved in the collision wait for the required interpacket delay of 9.6 µs and then select
random, and therefore usually different, delay times, referred to as backoff times, before
trying transmission of the same packet again.More specifically, the IEEE 802.3 standard defines a collision backoff
procedure referred to as "truncated binary exponential backoff." When a transmission
attempt has terminated due to a collision, it is retried by the transmitting node, after a
selected backoff time, until either the transmission is successful or a maximum number
of attempts have been made and all have terminated due to collisions. The backoff time 
is selected by each node as an integral multiple of the "slot time," which is the maximum
round-trip propagation time for the network, i.e. the time to propagate a data packet from
one end of the network to the other, and back. The slot time defined by the IEEE 802.3
standard is 51.2 µs. The number of

A
method for improving channel utilization and fairness of access,

for use in two nodes of a network employing a Carrier Sense Multiple
Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) protocol for channel access,

the method comprising the steps of:

after a collision, determining whether a node A has initially won or
lost access to a network channel;
if the node A has initially won channel access, determining if the node
A is beginning to transmit a succession of data packets separated by standard or

relatively short interpacket gap IPG intervals;
in another node B that has initially lost access to the channel, selecting
a relatively long IPG interval to ensure that node B operates as a receiver and to ensure

that there will be no further collisions;
starting separate back-to-back timers in nodes A and B when the first
data packet is transmitted and received, respectively;
checking the back-to-back timers in nodes A and B after every packet
transmission and reception, respectively;
upon expiration of the timer in node A, imposing a long delay during
which further transmission of data is deferred, then selecting the long IPG interval for

this node;
upon expiration of the timer in node B, selecting the standard or
relatively short IPG interval and initiating transmission of a data packet, whereby the

long delay by node A permits node B to function as a back-to-back transmitter;
wherein nodes A and B alternate transmit and receive functions without
need for collisions to resolve contentions for the network channel.

for use in a node of a network employing a Carrier Sense Multiple

Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) protocol for channel access,
the apparatus comprising:


means for enabling continuous but limited operation of the node
alternately in a back-to-back transmit mode and in a receive mode; and
means for selecting a standard or relatively short interpacket gap IPG
interval when the node is in the back-to-back transmit mode, and a longer IPG value

when the node is in the receive mode, whereby successive data packets can be
transmitted while in the back-to-back transmit mode, with minimal contention for
