<ABSTRACT>
In a casing, a grasp means and a movement means are
provided. The movement means is driven and controlled by a

control means with a container box being positioned in a
specified position based on coordinate data of an injection

drug housing member preinstalled in a coordinate data table
for moving the injection drug housing member to a graspable

position by the grasp means. Next, after grasped by the
grasp means, the injection drug housing member is

automatically transported to a desired position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an automatic feeding
device of injection drug housing members capable of taking
out infusion bottles and the like containing injection
drugs from a container box and feeding them automatically.Conventionally, automatic feeding of light-weighted
injection drugs such as ampoules has been implemented by
the automatic feeding device disclosed, for example, in
Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication HEI No. 5-229660,
Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication HEI No. 10-83476, and
Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication HEI No. 10-265037.However, the infusion bottle is large in weight as it
is used for drip phleboclysis, and therefore automatic
feeding is not attainable by the automatic feeding device.Also, since the infusion bottle is usually used for
drip phleboclysis in the state that a drug, particularly an
injection drug in ampoule, vials and the like, is premixed
in the infusion bottle, a device is demanded which enables 
automatic feeding of the infusion bottle as well as the
ampoule and the like.In order to solve the above problem of the present
invention, an automatic feeding device for automatically
feeding an injection drug housing member in a container box
carried in a casing based on injection drug prescription
data comprises in the casing,

   grasp means capable of grasping the injection drug
housing member housed in the container box;

   movement means for moving the grasp means; and

   control means for driving and controlling the movement
means based on coordinate data of the injection drug
housing member preinstalled in a coordinate data table in a
state that the container box is positioned in a specified
position so as to automatically transport the injection
drug housing member to a specified position after the
injection drug housing member being moved to a graspable
position by the grasp means and grasped by the grasp means.This structure makes it possible to easily support
changes of specifications and configurations of infusion
bottles and product layouts.The injection drug housing member may be an infusion
bottle,
 
   the grasp means may be capable of grasping a
bottleneck of the infusion bottle,

   the movement means may be for moving the grasp means
in X, Y, and Z axis direction, and

   the control means may be for driving and controlling
the movement means based on coordinate data of each housed
infusion bottle in a state that an upper face of the
container box is opened so as to automatically transport
the injection drug housing member to a specified
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An automatically feeding device of an injection drug
housing member in a container box carried in a casing based

on injection drug prescription data, comprising in the
casing:


grasp means capable of grasping the injection drug
housing member housed in the container box;
movement means for moving the grasp means; and
control means for driving and controlling the movement
means based on coordinate data of the injection drug

housing member preinstalled in a coordinate data table in a
state that the container box is positioned in a specified

position so as to automatically transport the injection
drug housing member to a specified position after the

injection drug housing member being moved to a graspable
position by the grasp means and grasped by the grasp means.
An automatic feeding device of an injection drug
housing member, wherein
