<ABSTRACT>
As a surgical treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome, guidance mechanism (12) and cutting mechanism (14) are subcutaneously inserted in spaced-apart incisions located by well-known landmarks. The guidance mechanism (12) is placed below the transverse carpal ligament, and the cutting mechanism (14) is placed above it. As the cutting mechanism (14) is advanced, it is guided by the guidance mechanism (12) and the knife portion divides the carpal ligament.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to surgical 
equipment, particularly, apparatus for severing the 
transverse carpal ligament in a person's hand in 
treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome. Carpal tunnel syndrome results from compression 
of the median nerve within the carpal tunnel of the 
hand. It occurs most often in people between 30 and 60 
years old and is several times more frequent in women 
than in men. Any condition that crowds or reduces the 
size of the carpal tunnel may initiate the symptoms. If 
there are mild symptoms present, injection of 
hydrocortisone into the carpal tunnel may afford relief. 
When symptoms are persistent and progressive, however, 
division of the deep transverse carpal ligament is 
recommended. In the 1950's, a procedure was developed for 
releasing the carpal tunnel ligament by pushing a closed 
blade. The procedure was rapidly discredited because of 
its inaccuracy and consequent failure rate. The 
original blade assembly resembled a meniscatome blade, 
but because the pathway of the blade was not directly 
controlled, it was possible for the surgeon to aim 
incorrectly and thereby sever nerves, arteries, or 
tendon structures. This was a truly blind procedure 
without guidance from additional devices or 
visualization. Shortly after that, surgeons began using an 
open surgical technique, which is still the prevalent 
surgical treatment. Briefly, various curved or zig-zag 
incisions are made from a point ulnar to and paralleling 
the thenar crease to approximately the flexor crease of 
the wrist. The skin and subcutaneous tissue are  
 
incised, and the transverse carpal ligament then 
divided. the incision is closed and the wound drained 
as needed. Following open surgical release, swelling at 
the base of the palm superficial to the carpal tunnel 
tends to persist for 12 to 16 weeks. during this time, 
the patient often experiences aching pain in the thenar 
or hypothenar eminences. Gripping activity aggravates 
the pain and may cause shooting sensations into the 
forearm. Resolution of the swelling is usually 
accompanied by relief of the pain. Further, open surgical release often results in 
a tender scar, a hospital stay, and sometimes an 
incomplete release of the carpal ligament. As disclosed in U.S. Patent 5,029,573, a recent 
surgical procedure involves the use of an endoscope. 
The concept of the endoscopic technique is to permit 
constant visualization during the surgery. Briefly, the 
procedure requires a surgeon and an assistant.

Apparatus (10) for dividing a transverse carpal 
ligament in a hand of a person, said apparatus including 


guidance means (12) for extending subcutaneously during 
operation across the carpal ligament between a pair of incisions in 

the volar side of the palm, said apparatus 
further including 
a cutting means (14) for extending subcutaneously during 
operation across the carpal ligament between said 

incisions, said cutting means (14) being guidable by said 
guidance means (12) between said incisions for dividing 

the carpal ligament, 
the cutting means (14) comprising a knife 
(42) with a unitary guided means (48) at one end (50) for being slidably guided 

by said guidance means (12), 
and a 

pulling means (44) for pulling said cutting means (14) 
along said guidance means (12), said pulling (44) means 

fashioned for extending during operation out through one 
of the incisions,
 
   characterised in that the pulling means (44) is 

attached to the knife (42) at an opposite end (46) of the 
knife (42) opposite the said one end (50), and said opposite 

end (46) is spaced from said guidance means (12) so that 
said pulling means (44) passes during operation over 

the carpal ligament whereas the 
guidance means (12) passes under said ligament such that during operation the carpal 

ligament is sandwiched between said pulling means and 
said guidance means. 
The apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said 
pulling means (44) is an elongate flexible rod (56) 

having a narrowed tip. 
The apparatus according to any one of claims 1-2, 
wherein said guidance means (12) includes a bimodal 

curve fashioned such that during operation the convex  
 

side of said curve extends towards the thumb of the hand. 
The apparatus according to any one of claims 1-3, 
wherein said guidance means (12) includes a tube (20) 

with a slot (22) running the length thereof, the tube 
(20) extending from a distal end (24) of the guidance 

means (12) to an entrance opening (26) near the proximal 
end of said guidance means (12), said entrance opening 

(26) fashioned to permit the introduction of said 
guided means (48) into said slot (22) of said guidance 

means (12), said slot (22) having a width less than the 
inside diameter of said tube (20). 
The apparatus according to claim 4, wherein said 
guided means (48) includes a guide member (54) adapted 

to fit closely within said tube (20), said guide member 
having a width perpendicular to said knife (42) which is 

greater than the width of said slot, said guide member 
(54) adapted to fit through said entrance opening (26), 

said knife (42) having a portion which is moveable 
through said slot from said entrance opening (26) to said 

distal end (24). 
The apparatus according to claim 5, wherein said 
knife (42) has a sharpened edge (52) facing said distal 

end (24) of said guidance means (12) when said guide 
member (54) is in said tube (20). 
The apparatus according to any one of claims 4-6, 
further comprising a rod (34) with a narrowed tip (36) 

and with an end (38) adapted to fit retainingly, but 
removably, in said distal end (24) of said tube (20), 

said rod (34) further comprising a bend (40) which during 
operation acts to direct said tip upwardly as said rod 

passes under the carpal ligament.
