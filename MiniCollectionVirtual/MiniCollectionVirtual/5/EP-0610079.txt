<ABSTRACT>
A print bar color printing system (Fig. 2) wherein exposure occurs through previously 
deposited color toner, light absorption in the previously deposited toner being compensated 

for by selectively increasing the output of the print bar during a pixel time interval. Each time 
interval is divided into sublines (1,2,3) which are available for applying image data (M,C,Y). 

One subline (1) transmits image data (M) corresponding to the color (Magenta) of the image to 
be exposed at the photoreceptor surface, while the second subline (2) carries information (C) as 

to previously exposed and developed color images (Cyan) which overlap the subsequent image. 
The print bar is then selectively addressed to form the main color image with a pulse (M) of 

relatively long duration, or duty cycle, followed by a pulse (C) having a relatively short duty 
cycle. The second (C) or third (M;Fig. 3C) pulses represent the additional exposure level needed 

to compensate for light absorbed by previous color toners formed on the belt during the earlier 
development process.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to plural, color image exposures formed on a
photoreceptor belt by at least one LED print bar and, more particularly, to improvements in
image exposure through previously exposed and developed images.Image print bars used in xerographic recording systems are well known in the art.
The print bar generally consists of a linear array of a plurality of discrete light emitting sources.
Light emitting diode (LED) arrays are preferred for many recording applications. In order to
achieve high resolution, a large number of light emitting diodes, or pixels, are arranged in a
linear array on a common substrate. Each LED in the linear array is used to expose a
corresponding area on a moving photoreceptor to an exposure value defined by the video data
information applied to the drive circuits of the print bars. The photoreceptor is advanced in the
process direction to provide a desired image by the formation of sequential scan lines.Color digital LED printers may operate in either a single pass or multiple pass mode.
In a single pass, process color system, three imagers are positioned adjacent to a moving
photoreceptor surface and are selectively energized to create successive image exposures, one
for each of the three process colors, cyan, magenta and yellow. A fourth black imager is usually
added. A color digital printer may also operate in a highlight color mode wherein one or two
colors and black are exposed. In a multiple pass system, each image area on the photoreceptor
surface must make at least three revolutions (passes) relative to the transverse scan lines
formed by the modulated beam generated by the imagers.In one prior art embodiment of a single pass color xerographic printer shown in
Figure 1, a plurality of LED print bars are positioned adjacent to a photoreceptor belt surface
and selectively energized to create successive image exposures. For full color, four bars are
used, one for each of the three basic colors (cyan, magenta and yellow) and a fourth print bar
for black images. FIG. 1 shows a color printing system having four exposure stations 10, 12, 14,
16, each station including an LED print bar 10A, 12A, 14A, 16A. Each print bar is selectively
addressed by video image signals processed through Electronic Sub System (ESS) 15 and
controlled by drive circuit 14 to produce a modulated output from each print bar which is
coupled through a gradient index lens array 10B, 12B, 14B, 16B, onto the surface of previously
charged photoreceptor belt 17. The length of belt 17 is

the surface of a photoreceptor belt (8), moving in a process direction (9), each latent image being

subsequently developed with a color toner with, successive image exposures accomplished in
superimposed registration with previously developed color images, the printer including:


charging means (18';112) for charging the photoreceptor belt surface,
