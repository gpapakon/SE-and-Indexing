<ABSTRACT>
- The invention relates to a device for ejecting an object which is removably attached to a structure, of the type including:   . an assembly (2) having a cylinder (3) and sliding piston (4), in which the said cylinder is integral with the said structure (S) and the said piston is connected to the said object (A); . first means (5), accommodated in the said assembly (2) and capable of ejecting the said object by sliding off the said piston from a retracted position to an emergent position; and . second means (6), connected to the said piston (4) and capable of rotating the said object about its axis.   - Advantageously, the said first (5) and second (6) means are elastic and controllable locking mechanisms (10 and 11) are respectively associated with the said first and second elastic means in order to make it possible, when they are actuated, to release the said first and second elastic means, respectively leading to the ejection and rotation of the said object.

Device for ejecting an object removably 
attached to a structure, of the type including: 


an assembly (2) comprising a cylinder (3) and a 
sliding piston (4) wherein said cylinder is fastened to 

said structure (S) and said piston is attached to said 
object (A); 
spring means adapted to eject said object and to 
rotate the latter about its axis, said spring means 

including first spring means (5) accommodated in said 
assembly (2) and causing said piston (4) to slide from a 

retracted position to a deployed position; and 
a selectively operable locking mechanism (10) 
associated with said first spring means (5) which is 

operated to enable release of said first spring means 
(5), characterized: 
in that said spring means include second spring 
means (6) linking said sliding piston (4) to said object 

(A) and adapted to rotate said object about its axis; and 
in that a selectively operable locking mechanism 
(11) is provided, associated with said second spring 

means and operated to allow release of said second spring 
means (6), causing said object to be rotated. 
Device according to claim 1,
 
characterized in that said first spring means (5) are 

defined by a cylindrical compression spring (5A) housed 

in said assembly (2) between the cylinder and the piston 
and in that said second spring means (6) are defined by a 

spiral circumferentially acting spring (6A) linking said 
sliding piston (4) to said object (A). 
Device according to claim 1 or claim 2,
 
characterized in that it further comprises selectively 

operable means (18) for adjusting the travel of said 
sliding piston (4) relative to the cylinder (3), 

associated with said assembly and acting on said first  
 

spring means. 
Device according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that an intermediate member (9) is 

provided between said piston (4) and said object (A) on 
which said object can be fixedly mounted and which is 

linked to said second spring means (6) and to its locking 
mechanism (11). 
Device according to claim 4,
 
characterized in that said selectively operable locking 

mechanism (10) of said first spring means (5) comprises a 
rod (12) that is fixed coaxially to the back wall of said 

cylinder (3) at one end (12A) and the other end (12B) of 
which passes through said piston and is widened in an 

oblong manner to project from an opening (9A) of 
substantially corresponding shape formed in said 

intermediate member (9) so that, when said second spring 
means are prestressed, said widened end and said opening 

are offset circumferentially, the piston being held in 
the retracted position compressing said first spring 

means, and in that, when said second spring means are 
released by their selectively operable locking mechanism, 

by virtue of the rotation of said member said opening is 
superposed with said widened end of the rod, allowing the 

member to pass through the latter and allowing ejection 
of said object by said piston in the deployed position 

due to the action of said first spring means. 
Device according to claim 4,
 
characterized in that said selectively operable locking 

mechanism (11) of said second spring means (6) comprises 
at least one retractable finger (15) immobilizing said 

member (9) against rotation when said second spring means 
(6) are prestressed. 
Device according to claim 6,
 
characterized in that said member (9) is mounted on an 

annular plate (8) with which it is constrained to rotate  
 

but relative to which it is free to move axially, said 
second spring means (6) respectively linking said plate 

(8) to the transverse face of said piston (4) and the 
retractable finger (15) of said locking mechanism (11) 

acting on the plate to constrain it to rotate with said 
member when said second spring means are prestressed. 
Device according to claim 7,
 
characterized in that a first needle or ball thrust 

bearing (22) is disposed between the transverse face of 
said piston and said plate and in that a second needle or 

ball thrust bearing (23) is disposed between the 
compression spring and the transverse face of said piston. 
Device according to any one of the preceding 
claims 3 through 8,
 
characterized in that said adjustment means (18) include 

a screw-nut mechanism housed coaxially in said assembly 
(2), said screw (19) being attached to the back wall of 

said cylinder to cooperate with a drive member (21) while 
said nut (20) is guided coaxially in said piston (4) so 

that, when said screw is rotated, said nut moves along 
said piston to determine its travel which corresponds to 

that of said cylindrical compression spring. 
Device according to claim 9,
 
characterized in that said screw (19) of the adjustment 

mechanism (18) is hollow and concentrically surrounds the 
rod (12) of the locking mechanism (10) of said first 

spring means. 
Device according to claim 9 or claim 10,
 
characterized in that the lateral skirt of said piston 

(4), sliding in said cylinder, is provided with lateral 
grooves (4C) with which said nut cooperates. 
Device according to any one of claims 9 
through 11,
 
characterized in that a damper member (24) is provided on 

said nut (20).
