<ABSTRACT>
The self-supporting building-site and advertising boarding system comprises an anchor (10), inserted aluminium columns (9), and advertisement panels (11) suspended in front of the latter. The advertisement surface, comprising a plurality of advertisement panels (11), is variable in terms of its surface area and its dimensions, that is to say, the appearance of the advertisement surface can be changed depending on the number of advertisement panels (11) used. In order to achieve this variability, but nevertheless to manage with a small number of, and also identical, structural parts, the anchor (10) has been designed to be variable in length and the advertisement-panel suspension means (2) has been designed to be variable in height. The design of the columns renders superfluous any supporting means, and the system is thus self-supporting.
