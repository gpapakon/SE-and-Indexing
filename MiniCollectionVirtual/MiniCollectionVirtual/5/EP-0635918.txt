<ABSTRACT>
A discharge device of the present invention 
including a pair of electrodes opposingly disposed in a 

sealed tube is characterized by the provision of a 
conductive member surrounding one of the electrodes in 

the sealed tube. An ignition system with a series gap 
has a built-in discharge device provided with a series 

gap, with one end connected to the center electrode side 
of the spark plug and with the other end connected to 

the high-tension cable side extending from the high-voltage 
distribution side. In this ignition system, a 

discharge device has a conductive member which surrounds 
one of the electrodes of the sealed tube, and one of the 

electrodes enclosed with the conductive member of this 
discharge device works as a cathode. Furthermore, in 

this ignition system with a series gap which includes a 
discharge tube provided with the series gap with one end 

connected to the center electrode side of the spark plug 
and the other end connected to the high-tension cable 

extending from the high-voltage distribution side, there 
is provided a conductive member encl
osing the cathode 
side of the discharge device to be installed in the 

casing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a discharge 
device suitable for use in an ignition system with a 
series gap for automotive engines, and an ignition 
system with a series gap using the discharge device. There is known in the prior art what is called 
a discharge tube used as a discharge device wherein a 
pair of electrodes are disposed on opposite sides in a 
sealed tube and an inactive gas is sealed in the sealed 
tube. Fig. 22 shows a discharge tube 1 used in for 
example an arrester for various kinds of electrical 
machinery and apparatus. In this discharge tube 1, the 
open sections at both ends of an insulation tube 2 as a 
sealed tube formed of ceramics or other are closed with 
a pair of electrode plates 4, 4 having discharge 
electrode sections 3, 3 which are disposed opposingly. 
In the insulation tube 2 is sealed a specific inactive  
 
gas. When overvoltage resulting from lighting or other 
has entered the device, there occurs an electric 
discharge between the discharge electrode sections 3, 3, 
momentarily energizing the discharge tube 1 to discharge 
the overcurrent to the ground side. Since the discharge tube 1 is placed and 
connected on a specific electric circuit of an arrester 
for example, there is arranged an electric element 
having a specific potential or a metal at a ground 
potential. If, in this manner, the discharge tube 1 is 
installed close to an electric element, an electric 
field formed around the electric element or other will 
affect the discharge tube 1, resulting in changed 
discharge voltage characteristics of the discharge tube 
1. There is also known as the prior art (Japanese 
Patent Publication No. 51-32180) an ignition system C 
for automotive engines which is provided with a so-called 
series gap S disposed in series with the spark 
plug 5 as shown in Fig. 23 in order to prevent the 
fouling of the spark plug 5 coated with carbon soot, 
thereby maintaining constant ignition timing. The 
formation of the series gap S of the discharge tube 1 
having the aforementioned constitution is considered.  The ignition system C with series gap as shown 
in Fig. 24, has the spark-tension cable 6 connected to 
the high-voltage distribution side. In the plug gap 7 
are opposingly disposed a connection terminal 9 designed 
to fit on a terminal 8 of the spark plug 5 and a high-voltage 
distribution terminal 10 connected to the end of 
the high-tension cable 6. And between the terminals 9 
and 10 the discharge tube 1 having the discharge 
electrodes 3, 3 are mounted. The
