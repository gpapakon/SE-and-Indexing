<ABSTRACT>
An internal shoe drum brake is provided with a strut adjuster (7) 
extending between a pair of brake shoes (1, 2) and including an adjuster 

lever (10) pivotally mounted on and cooperating with a main strut part 
(8). The pivot of the lever (10) is formed by shearing a boss (11) which 

is received in a slot (12) in the strut part (8) for rotational and linear 
movement. The boss (11) may be formed with a head (11') and the slot 

(12) may be open-ended or of keyhole configuration. A return spring 
(13) has end portions (13A', 13B') received respectively in an opening 

(14) of the strut part (8) and an opening (15) of the boss (11). A toothed 
formation (9', 9'') may be formed integrally with the strut part (8) by 

shearing.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an internal shoe drum brake, primarily for a 
motor vehicle, of the general kind having a stationary back-plate carrying 
a pair of brake shoes which are separable by actuating means into 
braking engagement with a rotary brake drum, and an automatic adjuster 
in the form of a strut extending between the shoes and including a pair 
of strut parts of which one is an adjuster element pivotally mounted on 
the other part and cooperating with toothed means rigid with the other 
part, the strut parts being operatively associated respectively with the 
brake shoes in such a manner that excessive separation of the shoes 
upon brake actuation results in separation of the adjuster element from 
the toothed means and angular movement of the element, enabling the 
element to re-engage the toothed means in a fresh position, upon brake 
release, to increase the effective length of the strut and thereby set a new 
outwardly adjusted retracted position of the shoes. An example of such 
a brake is described in our British Patent No. 1410514. The adjuster described in our aforesaid patent operates very satisfactorily 
in normal use on a vehicle, but employs a pivot pin connection between 
the adjuster element and the other strut part, which pin serves to connect 
a spring to the adjuster element, the spring acting between the strut parts 
longitudinally of the strut to urge the adjuster element into engagement 
with the toothed means. The use of a pivot pin in this manner leads to 
complications in manufacture and assembly of the components and 
relatively high production costs.  An object of the invention is to provide an adjuster of the aforesaid kind 
which may be manufactured in a more economical manner than that 
described in our aforesaid patent. In accordance with one feature of the invention, the adjuster element has 
a boss formed thereon, typically by a cold forming operation, 
dimensioned to fit within an aperture of the other strut part so as to 
provide a pivotal connection between the parts. The aperture may 
conveniently be a slot extending longitudinally of the strut to permit 
relative longitudinal movement of the strut parts, the boss fitting the 
aperture closely in a direction transversely of the slot to provide the 
pivotal connection. The boss may conveniently be hollow and the adjuster element is 
typically urged into engagement with the other strut part by a spring of 
which one end portion is engaged within the hollow boss and the other 
end portion is connected to the

<CLAIMS>
An internal shoe drum brake comprising a stationary back-plate 
(3) carrying a pair of brake shoes (1, 2) which are separable by actuating 

means (5) into braking engagement with a rotary brake drum, and an 
automatic adjuster in the form of a strut (7) extending between the shoes 

and including a pair of strut parts (8, 10) of which one (10) is an adjuster 
element pivotally mounted on the other part and cooperating with 

toothed means (9) rigid with the other part (8), the strut parts being 
operatively associated respectively with the brake shoes in such a 

manner that excessive separation of the shoes upon brake actuation 
results in separation of the adjuster element (10) from the toothed means 

(9) and angular movement of the element (10), enabling the element to 
re-engage the toothed means in a fresh position, upon brake release, to 

increase the effective length of the strut (7) and thereby set a new 
outwardly adjusted retracted position of the shoes, characterised in that 

the adjuster element (10) has a boss (11)formed thereon dimensioned to 
fit within an aperture (12) of the other strut part (8) so as to provide a 

pivotal connection between the parts (8,10). 
A brake according to Claim 1, characterised in that the boss (11) 
is formed on the adjuster element by a cold forming operation. 
A brake according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, characterised in that 
the aperture is a slot (12) extending longitudinally of the strut (7) to 

permit relative longitudinal movement of the strut parts (8, 10), the boss 
fitting the aperture closely in a direction transversely of the slot to 

provide the pivotal connection. 
A brake according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised in 
that the boss (11) is hollow and the adjuster element (10) is urged into 

engagement with the other strut part (8) by a spring (13) of which one 
end portion (13B')is engaged within the hollow boss (11) and the other 

end portion (13A') is connected to the other strut part (8). 
A brake according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the boss (11) has a peripheral flange (11') formed at 

its free end and spaced from the underside of the adjuster element (10), 
the flange engaging a surface of the strut part (8) facing away from the 

element (10) to retain the element and strut part in adjacent relationship. 
A brake according to Claim 5, characterised in that the 
underside of the strut part (8) is countersunk (12A) around the slot (12) to 

provide a surface engaged by the flange. 
A brake according to Claim 5, characterised in that the slot (12) 
is of keyhole shape and the flanged boss (11) is engaged with the strut 

part by engaging it through the larger part (12') of the keyhole slot and 
moving the adjuster element (10) along the slot, with the flange lying 

adjacent the underside of the strut part, to its normal operative position. 
A brake according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the toothed means is formed by stamping from the 

material of the strut part (8) to form an integral toothed formation (9', 
9")at one side of the strut part (8).

that the strut part (8) is kinked out of the plane of the strut by a distance 

 
approximately equal to the thickness of the adjuster element (10) to form

adjuster element (10), the teeth of the strut parts (8) for engagement by

cooperating with toothed means (9) rigid with the part (8), characterised 

in that the strut parts are pivotally interconnected by the boss (11) 

formed on the adjuster element and dimensioned to fit within an 
aperture (12) of the other part (8) so as to effect a pivotal connection 

between the parts. 
An adjuster according to Claim 10, characterised in that the 
aperture is a slot (12) extending longitudinally of the strut (7) to permit 

relative longitudinal movement of the strut parts in use, the boss fitting
