<ABSTRACT>
A method and a device for regenerating clock rate information 
in which data is intermediately stored in a memory (1) to 

which the data is read at a first rate (C₁) and out of which 
the data is read at a second rate (C
p
). The difference (n
p
, 
n
p
') between two levels (N/N', P) of the amount of data stored 
in the memory (1) is determined, after which the difference 

is compared with a reference value (10). The result from the 
comparison affects the second rate so that, at subsequent 

measurements of the difference, the difference between it and 
the reference value shall decrease.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for regeneration of 
clock rate information, in accordance with the preamble of 
claim 1. The invention also relates to a device for recreating clock 
rate information, in accordance with the preamble of claim 6. An often used method for transmitting data in a data 
transmission network is to pack (multiplex) the information 
together with other information from other data sources and 
transmit data in the form of packets over a transmission 
channel. This means that the transmission medium is used in 
a more effective way and that the transmission costs are 
reduced. In general, data is transmitted through the network 
at higher clock rates as compared to the clock rate of the 
original data source. When the information is received it is 
required that the original clock information is regenerated. A common method for achieving this is to store data 
intermediately in a FIFO (First In First Out) memory. Out of 
this memory, data may then be read at a rate which 
corresponds to the original rate. An oscillator of the VCO 
type (Voltage Controlled Oscillator) or the VCXO type 
(Voltage Controlled X-tal (Crystal) Oscillator) is often used 
for generating clock pulses for the read-out. The control  
 
voltage of the oscillator will then be proportional to the 
content level of the FIFO memory, i.e. the larger amount of 
data in the FIFO memory, the higher read-out rate. Some common problems associated with this device is to obtain 
sufficiently jitter-free clock pulses with a reasonable depth 
of the FIFO, and that the information regarding the content 
level in most cases is not available in standard FIFO 
components. Another problem which arises when the 
transmission channel transmits a data packet into the FIFO is 
that the content level momentarily increases and leads to a 
quick increase of the read-out rate. Thereafter, no data 
arrives at the FIFO during a period, whereby the clock rate 
decreases until another data packet arrives, and so on. This 
is repeated periodically and leads to variations in the rate 
of the read-out clock (jitter). In order to counteract this, it is common to increase the 
depth of the FIFO memory and to filter the control signal. 
The drawback with this is that the solution becomes more 
complex (deeper FIFO) and, because of the fact that the 
control signal is more heavily filtered, that the oscillators 
(VCXO/VCO) will experience difficulties in following the 
natural rate variations which may occur in the data signal. The
