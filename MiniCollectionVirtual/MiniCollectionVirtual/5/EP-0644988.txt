<ABSTRACT>
Transmission unit for driving two parallel shafts, at least one shaft being movable at right angles to its lengthwise direction, for example for a rolling mill (1). In this case each shaft (8, 11) is provided with a crown wheel (14, 15) which meshes with a cylindrical pinion (16), each pinion having a shaft (17) of which the axis intersects or crosses the axis of the shaft belonging to the crown wheel at right angles, and the rotations of the pinions being interconnected with a fixed transmission ratio. The cylindrical pinions can be fitted on one common shaft which can lie in the plane through the axes of the two shafts or at a fixed distance parallel to said plane, independent of the movement of one of the shafts or both shafts. Two pinions can be combined to form one pinion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a transmission unit to drive 
two shafts lying parallel, at least 
one shaft being movable at right angles to its lengthwise 
direction. 
The FR-A 538 817 as the closest prior art comprises the 
features defined in the preamble of claim 1. This FR-A 
538 817 discloses in detail a transmission unit having 
only a pulley driven worm shaft to drive two parallel 
shafts bearing rolls defining a gap for passing through a 
material to be treated, for instance textiles or thin 
metallurgical materials, each shaft rotating about its 
longitudinal axis, one driven shaft being movable at 
right angles to its longitudinal axis for adjusting the 
size of the gap, wherein the driven shafts are each provided 
with a worm wheel which meshes with a worm, each 
worm having a rotation axis that crosses at right angles 
the longitudinal axis of the corresponding driven shaft, 
the movable driven shaft being movable only in the direction 
of the rotation axis of the worm pinion that meshes 
with the worm wheel provided on said driven shaft, and 
the rotations of the worms being interconnected with a 
fixed transmission ratio. Moreover, a known transmission unit is used for, for example, 
driving two rolls of a rolling mill, in which the rolls are 
movable relative to each other in order to adjust the 
desired rolling thickness. The two rolls are in this case 
driven by one common drive motor. The transmission unit 
between the drive motor and the two rolls can then consist 
of a gear transmission with intermediate gears and/or bevel 
gears. Such a transmission unit has the disadvantage that 
it is complex in construction and that the synchronisation 
between the shafts is effected by means of a long, weak 
gear train. Moreover, in the case of rolling mills the 
bottom roll is often immovably fixed in a frame, and the 
top roll is movable, the bottom roll being driven by means 
of a fixed drive shaft and the top roll by means of a drive 
shaft with homokinetic couplings. This has the disadvantage 
that the torque which can be transmitted by the drive shaft 
with the homokinetic couplings is limited, particularly in 
the case of large roll gap variations, and the torsional 
stiffness of said drive shaft is not satisfactory. Finally, 
such a transmission unit requires a large amount of space 
next to the rolling mill. The object of the invention is to eliminate these 
disadvantages means of a transmission unit of the type 
mentioned by the features of claim 1. This arrangement ensures that when a
