<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the treatment of waste water containing
a harmful ion such as a heavy metal ion by the coagulating

sedimentation method using an inorganic coagulant
such as an iron compound or an aluminum compound. After

separating treated water from the sediment (sludge) in which
the harmful ion is incorporated in insoluble form, the pH of

a mixture of the sediment and water is suitably adjusted to
cause elution of the harmful ion from the sediment. Then the

sediment is separated from the eluate and reused as an inorganic
coagulant. By reusing the sediment in this manner, the

waste water treatment is accomplished without producing a
large quantity of sludge and the consumption of inorganic

coagulant and auxiliary chemicals can be greatly reduced,
while the concentration of the harmful ion in the treated

water becomes sufficiently low.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of treating
waste water containing a harmful ion such as a heavy
metal ion or fluorine ion to remove the harmful ion by
coagulating sedimentation by using an inorganic
coagulant such as an iron salt or an aluminum salt.For the treatment of waste water containing a
harmful ion such as a heavy metal ion or fluorine ion, a
conventional method is the coagulating sedimentation
method using an inorganic coagulant. That is, under an
appropriate pH condition a coagulant such as an iron
salt, aluminum salt or magnesium salt is added to the
waste water to form a hydroxide sediment in which the
harmful ion is incorporated by adsorption,
coprecipitation and/or raction with the coagulant, and
then the sediment is separated from the treated water.
In the case of waste water containing fluorine, another
conventional mathod is the addition of a calcium
compound to precipitate fluorine as calcium fluoride. A
problem common to these conventional methods is that the
hydroxide sediment or calcium fluoride precipitate
becomes sludge which is large in quantity and high in
water content and which is harmful waste.To decrease the quantity of sludge produced by the
treatment of waste water, there are some proposals of
reusing a portion of the sludge as coagulant for
treating waste water. For example, JP-A 60-241988
relates to the treatment of waste water containing
fluorine with a calcium compound and an inorganic
coagulant such as aluminum sulfate and proposes to reuse 
at least a portion (e.g., 20 to 50%) of the sludge as
part of the coagulant. However, in this methd the
coagulating capability of the fresh coagulant is
adversely affected by florine existing in the reused
sludge. Therefore, the efficiency of the treatment
lowers, and it is difficult to greatly decrease the
quantity of produced sludge.JP-B 58-13230 proposes to treat waste water
containing fluorine by the steps of first removing most
of fluorine as calcium fluoride precipitate, then
forming magnesium hydroxide precipitate which
incorporates therein the remaining fluorine, separating
the composite precipitate from treated water, dissolving
the separated precipitate in acidic water and recycling
the obtained solution. JP-A 1-107890, which relates to
the treatment of waste water containing boron and
fluorine by the addition of a calcium compound and an
aluminum compound, proposes to reuse aluminum in the
sludge by eluting aluminum from the sludge separated
from treated water and recycling the aluminum eluate.
By these methods it

A method of treating waste water containing at least
one kind of heavy metal ions selected from lead, cadmium,

copper, arsenic, antimony, selenium and mercury as harmful
matter, comprising the steps of:


(a) adjusting the pH of the waste water and adding an
inorganic coagulant to the waste water to form a hydroxide

sediment in which said heavy metal ions are incorporated in
insoluble form and further adding a polymer coagulant to

the waste water;
(b) separating said hydroxide sediment from the
treated waste water;
(c) adjusting the pH of a mixture of the separated
sediment and water to cause elution of the heavy metal from

the sediment, further adding a polymer coagulant to said
mixture, and separating the sediment from the eluate containing

the heavy metal ion; and
