<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for storing and mounting the body for a cabinet, furniture or the like, consisting of two sides (2, 3), top (1) and base (4), where adjacent end sections of said sides, top and base are provided with articulation devices (6, 7, 8, 11) to join the parts together. Said sides, top and base are arranged in transport or storage state such that said top and one of the sides (1, 2) lie parallel with said base and the other side (3, 4). The body is mounted by moving said two sides (2, 3), together with the top (1) and base (4), in mutually parallel relationship like a parallellogram until said two sides (2, 3) are vertical, whereafter at least one of the two sets of articulation devices (6, 8) situated diagonally in the body is releasably locked into position. The means for forming an articulated joint between adjacent end sections of the structural parts, e.g., sides, top and base of a body for a cabinet or the like, comprises a cup-shaped body (6; 7; 8) which is hinge-connected to an approximately L-shaped (8'), U-shaped (6') or stepped straight arm. The arm may be equipped with a rotatable tension pin adapted for engagement with a recess in the member.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cabinet body structure or 
the like consisting of two sides, a top and a base, and a means 
for forming an articulated joint between adjacent end sections 
of the structural parts, e.g., sides, top and base of a body 
for a cabinet, furniture, etc. Cabinets, furniture or the like almost always consist of two 
sides plus a top and base which form a rectangle. These four 
units are connected together at the corners by means of methods 
such as mitring, edge joining or dovetailing. The latter method 
has all but disappeared from commercial products due to high 
costs and inefficient production. The mitring alternative is 
realistic only when a definitive jointing takes place at the 
factory. Edge jointing is therefore the totally dominant method of section 
joining today. If the joining is done at a factory, an 
enormous amount of space is required for warehousing and distribution, 
which thus become very expensive. Therefore, a significant 
share of the manufacturing is done according to the 
so-called "knock-down" system, i.e., the delivered goods 
consist of finished, surface-treated separate sections that are 
assembled by the customer. In order for such a system to function, 
detailed labeling and description must accompany the delivery. 
If the customer has had no experience with such mounting, 
which is often the case, the customer will often have 
problems with the assembly and will use a great deal of time 
before the right parts are correctly assembled and the structure 
has the final form that is intended. There are a number of different systems for joining the parts, 
e.g., screws with visible decorative heads or tension devices 
and lockable hooks. All known solutions, however, have the 
common feature that the four sides of which the structure 
consists are disconnected units.  
 Foldable cabinets or the like are known to overcome the inconveniences 
mentioned above. Through US-A-3 829 190 and US-A-926 
367 such objects are known. However, they are unstable, due to 
their foldable construction, and are provided with a number of 
braces and cross pieces to hold the construction in erected 
position. Common hinges are used. SE 421 439 relates to a cupboard hinge means having an L-shaped 
arm adjustably engageable with a receiving pocket on a cupboard 
wall and a cup shaped member fitted into a recess in the cupboard 
door, said L-shaped arm being pivotally connected to said member. 
Said member has a resilient means capable of engaging a hole on 
the longest

body for enabling storing and mounting of such cabinet body; said 
body structure comprising first and second side panels (2,3), a 

top panel (1) and a base panel (4) adjacent end sections of said 
side, top and base panels being provided with said articulation 

joint means (6,7,8,11) to join adjacent panels together, thereby 
enabling movement of said first and second side panels (2,3), 

together with said top panel (1) and base panel (4) from a 
storage position and in mutually parallel relationship until said 

side panels are vertical, and fixing said body in an erected 
position, wherein said articulation joint means include a first 

typa of articulation device (7,11) located at internal corners of 
the cabinet and being subjected to an increase in included angle 

upon erection of the cabinet body, said first type articulation 
device comprising a first cup-shaped member (7; 11) being pivotably 

connected at an uppermost open section thereof to a first L-shaped 
or stepped arm (41;43) said first arm being provided with 

a first rotatable fixation pin (10) adapted for engagement with 
a first ledge (7;11) on said member (7,7') for interlocking said 

member and said arm, and a second type of articulation device 
(6;8) to be located at internal corners of the cabinet and being 

subjected to a decrease in included angle upon erection of the cabinet 
body, said second type device comprising a second cup-shaped member 

(6;8) and a second U- or L-shaped arm (6';8') with ends of a 
pivot shaft (30) thereof each movable in an oblong bearing slot 

(31;33) in said member (6;8) as said second arm (6';8') moves 
between its outer positions, said second arm (6',8') being provided 

with a second ledge (6'';8'') adapted for engagement with a second
