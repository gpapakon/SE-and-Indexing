<ABSTRACT>
In an I.C. engine there are two dynamic balancing 
shafts driven in rotation in respectively opposite directions, 

at a speed twice that of the 
crankshaft. The dynamic balancing shafts are driven by a 

toothed belt transmission (1), comprising a driving pulley (2) 
keyed on the crankshaft, two driven pulleys (3,4) keyed on the 

balancing shafts and a tensioning pulley (5) rotatably engaged 
with the base. The pulleys (2,3,4,5) are connected together 

by a belt (6) having an internal (9) and external (10) toothing 
with a toothing pitch (P) equal to 7.5mm, and provided with a 

resistant insert (7) formed by glass fibre cords (8) having a 
diameter equal to 0.9mm.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a toothed belt transmission
for driving dynamic balancing shafts in endothermic engines, of
the type comprising: a driving pulley keyed on a crankshaft
rotatably supported by a base of an endothermic engine; a first
and a second driven pulley keyed on respective dynamic
balancing shafts rotatably engaged with the base, said driven
pulleys each having a pitch diameter equal to 1/2 of a pitch
diameter of the driving pulley; a toothed tensioning pulley
rotatably engaged with the base; a toothed transmission belt
extending along a closed line partially wound over said
driving, driven and tensioning pulleys, said transmission belt
having a resistant insert formed by a plurality of cords lying
consecutively side by side, incorporated in at least one layer
of elastomer material in which there are defined a set of
internal teeth that engages with respective toothings of the
driving pulley, of the first driven pulley and of the
tensioning pulley, and an external toothing that engages with a
respective toothing of the second driven pulley.Both toothings are preferably coated with at least one
reinforcing layer of textile material.As is known, many endothermic engines used in motor cars or
motor cycles are provided with a pair of dynamic balancing
shafts rotatably housed in the base and constituting
essentially respective eccentric masses that, by rotating in
respective opposite directions and at twice the speed with
respect to the rate of rotation of the crankshaft, are used to
eliminate vibrations due to the forces of inertia, as well as 
to other perturbing torques, that are well known to be
generated when the engine is in operation.To this end, the dynamic balancing shafts are driven by a
belt transmission that essentially comprises a toothed belt
extending, along a closed line, between respective toothed
pulleys.In particular, there is a driving pulley keyed on the
crankshaft, a first and a second driven pulley respectively
keyed on the dynamic balancing shafts, as well as a toothed
tensioning pulley rotatably engaged with the base of the
engine.Since the dynamic balancing shafts must rotate at a rate
equal to twice that of the crankshaft, the driven pulleys have
a pitch diameter, and number of teeth, equal to half those of
the driving pulley.The toothed belt essentially has an inextensible insert
formed by at least one cord for example in glass fibre
helically wound in the usual manner to form a plurality of
turns lying consecutively side by side along the extension of
