<ABSTRACT>
A process for preparing unsaturated dimers of α-methylstyrene 
comprising dimerizing α-methylstyrene using 

activated clay or acid clay as a catalyst, in which the 
dimerization is carried out in the presence of a carbonic 

acid ester, preferably ethylene carbonate, which process 
achieves high selectivity to unsaturated dimers with ease in 

controlling the reaction temperature.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for preparing 
unsaturated dimers of α-methylstyrene. More particularly, it 
relates to a process for preparing unsaturated dimers of α-methylstyrene 
comprising dimerizing α-methylstyrene using 
activated clay or acid clay as a catalyst. An unsaturated dimer of α-methylstyrene is useful as 
a raw material of a lubricant for traction drive, a solvent 
for coatings, and a chain transfer reagent for polymerization 
reaction. It is known that dimerization of α-methylstyrene 
under an acidic condition gives 1,1,3-trimethyl-3-phenylindane 
as a saturated dimer, 2,4-diphenyl-4-methyl-1-pentene 
and 2,4-diphenyl-4-methyl-2-pentene as unsaturated 
dimers, and 2,4,6-triphenyl-4,6-dimethyl-1-heptene, etc. as 
trimers. Of these oligomers, the unsaturated dimers are useful 
for their applicability. Known processes for selectively 
obtaining the unsaturated dimers include dimerization of α-methylstyrene 
in the presence of a solid acid, such as 
activated clay or acid clay, or a cation exchange resin as a 
catalyst and an approximately equivalent amount of water or a 
polyhydric alcohol (cf. JP-A-48-44240, the term "JP-A" as  
 
used herein means an "unexamined published Japanese patent 
application"). However, when activated clay or acid clay is 
mixed with water or a polyhydric alcohol, the catalyst 
undergoes aggregation due to its high affinity for water or 
the polyhydric alcohol and fails to function effectively, 
resulting in a low reaction rate. Additionally, the catalyst 
tends to aggregate and makes fouling on the wall of the 
reactor. A dimerization process for α-methylstyrene using a 
solid acid catalyst with a polyethylene glycol monoalkyl 
ether as a co-catalyst has been proposed (cf. JP-A-63-192727). 
In this process, a polyethylene glycol monoalkyl 
ether is used in an amount of from 0.001 to 0.06% by weight 
based on the starting material. The process has a 
disadvantage in that the reaction temperature control is 
practically difficult because of reaction heat. An object of the present invention is to provide a 
process for dimerizing α-methylstyrene at high selectivity to 
unsaturated dimers with ease in controlling the reaction 
temperature. The present invention provides a process for 
preparing unsaturated dimers of α-methylstyrene comprising 
dimerizing α-methylstyrene using activated clay or acid clay 
as a catalyst, in which the dimerization is carried out in  
 
the presence of a carbonic acid ester as a reaction 
controlling reagent. The process of the
