<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for generating a noise sound, which is 
equipped in industrial electric cars with little or no driving 

sound and generates an appropriate amount of noise sound so 
that the nearby cars or pedestrians can notice their approch in 

a narrow pathway or stock room. The apparatus has a 
cornical air collector (1) installed in the car, 

a shutter (5) installed 
rotatably in the air collector (1) and controls the flow amount of 

air passing through the air collector (1), and a U-shaped tube (4) 
installed apart by a predetermined distance from a small 

diameter portion (9) of the air collector (1) and generates the noise 
sound by the air discharged from the air collector.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus generating a 
noise sound for an electric car (hereinafter, referred to as 
"noise sound generator"), and particularly to an apparatus 
which is equipped in industrial electric cars with little or no 
driving sound and generates an appropriate amount of noise 
sound so that the nearby cars or pedestrians can notice their 
approch in a narrow pathway or stock room. The conventional industrial car or other cars driven by 
electricity produce little or no driving sound while driving. 
Accordingly, drivers of the nearby cars and pedestrians often 
can not notice the approaching electric car, causing a 
dangerous situation or an accident to occur. On the other hand, the approach of car is generally noticed  
 
by a horn sound. However, the horn causes not only 
considerable amount of noise, but unpleasant feeling to other 
car drivers and pedestrians. Particularly, since the use of the 
horn is more restricted in an indoor space of the stockroom or 
the narrow pathway, the accidents can happen frequently 
unless the drivers are very wary of driving.  It is an object of the present invention to provide a noise 
sound generator for an electric car which generates an 
appropriate loudness of noise sound so that nearby cars or 
pedestrians can notice the approach thereof, thus preventing 
accidents in advance. It is another object of the present invention to provide a 
noise sound generator for an electric car which can avoid the 
loud noise and the unpleasant environment due to the use of 
the horn. In order to achieve the above obects, there is provided a 
noise sound generator for a car driven by an electrical motor, 
comprising a means for generating a predetermined amount of 
alarm sound by a driver's operation, thereby the approach of 
the car is noticed to nearby cars or a pedestrians. According to one aspect of the present invention, said 
means comprises a cornical air collector, a shutter installed 
rotatably in said air collector and controls the flow amount of 
air passing through said air collector, and a U-shaped tube 
installed apart by a predetermined distance from a small 
diameter portion of said air collector and generates the noise 
sound by the air discharged from said air collector. According to another aspect of the present invention, said 
means comprises a current amplifier connected to an output  
 
port of an accelerator pedal which supplies a proportional 
driving signal current to said electrical motor, a buzzer 
connected to an output
