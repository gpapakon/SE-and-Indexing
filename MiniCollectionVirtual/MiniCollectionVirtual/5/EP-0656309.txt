<ABSTRACT>
The device has a distributor (11) with a rectilinear conveying stage (12), on which the N bundles of security papers coming from a stack of sheets of security papers are advanced one behind the other up to N predetermined bundle positions. Mounted underneath the conveying stage (12) having an adjustable bottom (13) are N magazines in the form of vertical shafts which are located vertically below the bundle positions. After all the N bundle positions on the conveying stage (12) are occupied by bundles, the bottom (13) is swung down, so that all the N bundles can fall simultaneously into the N magazine shafts. After the bottom has been closed, the next N bundles on the conveying stage (12) come into their bundle positions and, after the bottom has been opened, can fall as a second layer into the magazines. After packets with a predetermined number of bundles of security papers located one above the other have been formed in these magazines, these packets are pushed by means of slides (16) out of the magazines (15) on to a transport stage (17), mounted next to the magazines, for the purpose of further processing.

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for producing packs of notes (P)
comprising Z bundles of notes stacked one above the

other, which each contain H consecutively numbered
notes of value and are formed by cutting Z successive

stacks each with H successive sheets of notes, each
sheet of notes having N note prints and the same note

positions of successive sheets being consecutively
numbered, and the N bundles of notes (10) originating

from a stack of sheets (1) being moved spaced apart one
behind the other on a transporting system (T) and the

groups of N bundles of notes each originating from
successive stacks of sheets following one another,

having a distributor (11) for the periodic depositing
of in each case N successive bundles of notes (10) in N

different magazines (15), in which Z bundles of notes
are in each case stacked into a pack (P) which contains

Z x H notes of value with a complete sequence of
numbers, and having a removal device (16) for

displacing the packs (P) out of the magazines (15) onto
a transporting section (17) for further processing,

characterized in that the distributor (11) has a
straight conveying section (12), which adjoins the

transporting system (T) and has at least N different
bundle positions and a base (13) which can be

adjusted by an automatically controllable actuating
mechanism and serves as a rest for the bundles, a

system of drivers (14), installed above this base (13),
for the advancement of the bundles and also, underneath

the base, N magazines (15), which are aligned with the
bundle positions and are in the form of compartments, 

in that the transporting section (17) runs next to the
magazines, parallel to the mentioned conveying section

(12), and in that the actuating mechanism is set up for
adjusting the base (13) to expose the upper magazine

openings whenever all N bundle positions are occupied
by bundles, so that the N bundles drop into the N

magazines (15), and for subsequently closing the base
again before the first bundle of the following group of

N bundles arrives, and in that the removal device (16)
is set up for displacing the packs (P) simultaneously

out of the magazines (15) onto the transporting
section (17) once there have been formed N complete

packs (P) with Z bundles of notes each.
The apparatus as claimed in claim 1, characterized
in that the mentioned adjustable base (13) comprises two

halves (13a, 13b) which can be swung downward.
The apparatus as claimed in claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that it is constructed from modular

units (11A, 11B, 11C, 11D, 11E) which can be fitted one
against the other, each of which is designed for

the simultaneous processing of an equal number of
bundles and in each case comprises a correspondingly

long distributor portion and an assigned portion of the
transporting section.
The apparatus as claimed in one of claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that it is designed for producing packs

from a preselectable number of bundles, preferably 10
bundles with 100 notes of value each.
The apparatus as claimed in one of claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the transporting of the bundles

by means of the drivers (14) is designed as a cycled
advancement. 
The apparatus as claimed in one of claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the conveying section (12) has for

lateral guidance of the bundles side walls (20a, 20b)
which can be set by a central adjusting means (24, 25)

for adaptation to the bundle format.
The apparatus as claimed in one of claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that the magazines (15) are bounded

transversely to the transporting direction of the
bundles (10) by in each case a side wall (27a)

fitted fixedly on the apparatus rack (19) and in
each case a side wall (27b) which is adjustable with

respect to the first side wall and wherein all the
adjustable side walls (27b) can be adjusted together by

a central adjusting means (28, 29) for the purpose
of adaptation of the magazine dimension to the bundle

format.
The apparatus as claimed in claim 7, characterized in
that the adjustable side walls (27b) can

additionally be adjusted before the dropping of the
bundles with the aid of an automatically actuable

adjusting element (30) simultaneously out of the
position set to the bundle format into a position

enlarging the magazine dimension and subsequently
back again into the position adapted to the bundle

format.
The apparatus as claimed in one of claims 1 to 8,
characterized in that the transporting section (17) for

the packs (P) is equipped with a cycle-by-cycle
operating advancing system (18).
The apparatus as claimed in claim 9, characterized
in that the cycle-by-cycle operating advancing system

(18) for the packs (P) has a drive which is independent
of the preceding functions.
