<ABSTRACT>
2.1. The invention serves to optimise the characteristic values of optoelectronic components based on DFB gratings or DBR gratings. 2.2. According to the invention, there is located laterally centrally in the longitudinal direction (z direction, axial direction) a sequence of grating-free partial regions, on which border laterally two DFB or DBR grating regions, which in turn are laterally bounded on the outside by grating-free partial regions, the four lateral grating limits being designed in the shape of continuously running curves. The lateral guide of the waves is in this case supported to a considerable extent by the specific geometric design of the grating regions and of the grating-free regions as well as by the choice of the vertical refractive-index variation. 2.3. The solution according to the invention can be used in a particularly advantageous manner in optoelectronic components, such as lasers, laser amplifiers, filters, couplers and switches.
