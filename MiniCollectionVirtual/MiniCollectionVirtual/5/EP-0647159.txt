<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a structure which can
be used in reactions wherein the reaction and distillation
of the reaction system are carried on concurrently using
the structure as both catalyst for the reaction and as a
distillation structure.U.S. Pat. No. 4,215,011 discloses a plurality of closed
cloth pockets containing a particulate catalytic material
arranged and supported by wire mesh. U.S. Pat. No.
4,250.052 discloses distillation packing structure
consisting of sulfonated cation resin.U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,232,177 and 4,242,530 disclose the use
of such structures for various catalytic reaction
processes. U.S. Pat. No. 2,403,672 functionally states that
the catalyst serves as the packing material in the column
to fractionate the reaction products, however, no
indication of the physical means to obtain this is
disclosed.U.S. Pat. No. 4,443,559 discloses catalytic distillation
structures for use in reaction distillation columns. These
catalytic structures being in the shape of a single
cylinder, sphere, doughnut, cube, or tube.The present invention provides a catalytic distillation
structure for use in reactions, which can be used as a
distillation structure. In order to serve both functions,
it has been found that the structure must meet three
criteria. First, the structure must be such as to provide
for even spatial dispersement in the reactor distillation
column. That is, the catalyst structures must rest in the
column in a geometric arrangement which will perform the
desired functions of reaction and distillation sites. To
achieve this the structure must be such as to provide
fairly uniform spatial distribution in the column.A second criteria is that there must be sufficient free
space in the catalyst bed to allow for the liquid phase 
surface contact and vapor phase distillation with the
concurrent separation of the material in the column by the
distillation into vapour and liquid phases. It has been
observed that in the catalyst bed a free space of about 50
volume % is adequate to obtain an operable fractionation.A third criteria is the necessity for the catalyst bed
to be able to expand and contract as it must during use
without undue attribution of the catalyst.These criteria have been met in the structures
described and used in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,242,530; 4,232,177;
4,250,052, 4,215,011 and 4,443,559 described above.EP-A 0494550 discloses a container, in a material
permeable to gas and to liquids, which is formed
approximately as a tetrahedron.EP-A 0559511 discloses a chain of containers
