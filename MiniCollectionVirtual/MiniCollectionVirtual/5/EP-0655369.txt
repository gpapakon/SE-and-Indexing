<CLAIMS>
A method of producing a piece of equipment, in particular for a motor vehicle, 
comprising a frame (1) provided with an open dish-shaped receptacle (2) for 

accommodating an inflatable bag (3) in a folded state and with a lining (5), characterised 
in that it comprises the following steps: 


at least the inflatable bag (3) is arranged in the folded state in the dish-shaped 
receptacle (2); 
the opening of the dish-shaped receptacle (2) is sealed using a sealing 
compound (4) which can be torn when the bag inflates; 
the frame with its dish-shaped receptacle (2) provided with the bag (3) and 
the sealing compound (4) is arranged in a mould for producing the lining by 

injection of plastic material; and 
the plastic material is injected into the mould to form the lining (5). 
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in that the opening of the dish-shaped 
receptacle is sealed using a film (4) of sealing compound.
