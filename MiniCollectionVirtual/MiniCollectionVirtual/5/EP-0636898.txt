<ABSTRACT>
An improved imaging system. The inventive imaging 
system (10) is adapted to transmit a plurality of first 

radar signals at millimeter wave frequencies at an area 
including an object along with background clutter. The 

return signals are processed to provide a three 
dimensional image for applications demanding visibility 

through fog, haze, smoke and other obscurants. Such 
applications include enhanced vision for helicopters, 

ships, buses, trucks, traffic observation stations for an 
intelligent highway or security cameras for plants and 

military installations. In a guidance system 
application, for example, the inventive system would 

include an electronically scanning antenna (12) to 
provide range and amplitude signals representative of a 

target area. The range and amplitude signals (18, 20) 
are compared to stored signals (26, 30) to create the 

three dimensional image. The stored signals are selected 
for comparison based on the dive angle of the missile 

(28, 32). The three dimensional image is then processed 
(22, 24, 34, 36, 38, 40) to derive guidance commands for 

the missile.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to tracking and
guidance systems. More specifically, the present
invention relates to air-to-ground tracking and guidance
systems.While the present invention is described herein with
reference to illustrative embodiments for particular
applications, it should be understood that the invention
is not limited thereto. Those having ordinary skill in
the art and access to the teachings provided herein will
recognize additional modifications, applications, and
embodiments within the scope thereof and additional
fields in which the present invention would be of
significant utility.Many systems and techniques, such as disclosed in US-A-5061930,
are known in the art for
providing terminal guidance for missiles and other
aircraft, including television, infrared, radar, and
laser based systems. Each has advantages in certain
applications. For example, television based systems
allow a human operator to be involved in the target
selection, discrimination and guidance processes.
However, television guided systems are limited to
environments with adequate visibility. Thus, these 
systems are not as useful at night, in fog, rain or
smoke.Infrared systems provide guidance based on heat
radiated from a target. Infrared systems are not limited
to environments with good visibility. However, infrared
systems generally have limited range and limited accuracy
when the target and its background have comparable
thermal profiles.Laser guided systems offer good accuracy but are
limited in range and expensive.Radar guided systems provide an all-weather
capability. However, the accuracy of conventional radar
guided systems is limited when attacking at high dive
angles and when attacking vertical targets.Thus, a need exists in the art for a system for
accurately guiding a craft to a target at high dive
angles in adverse weather conditions. Further, there is
a need in the art for a system for accurately guiding a
craft to a vertically structured target from the side at
a low or nearly horizontal trajectory.The need in the art is addressed by the present invention which provides
a guidance system for a missile comprising:
first means mounted on said missile for transmitting a plurality of first
radar signals at millimeter wave frequencies at an area including a target and
background clutter;second means mounted on said missile for receiving reflections of said
millimeter wave radar signals from said target and said background clutter and
generating second signals in response thereto;third means for
