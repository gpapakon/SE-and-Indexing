<ABSTRACT>
In a digital transmission system comprising a transmitter (2) coupled 
via
 a 
channel (4) to a receiver (6) a detection signal r
k
 is compared with a number of 
reference values to determine the destination symbols a and
k
. Since the size of the received 
signal r
k
 is not known in advance, the ratio between the detection signal and the 
reference values is to be determined by adapting means (16) on the basis of the received 

signal and the decisions made. 
The problem may then occur that as a result of an initially erroneous 
value of the ratio between detection signal and reference values not a correct adaptation 

is made. By recognizing according to the inventive idea such a situation because specific 
values of the symbols a and
k
 are lacking, in such a situation said ratio can be brought to 
such a value by the correction means (18) that all the values of a and
k
 again occur.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a digital transmission system comprising a
transmitter coupled to a receiver by a channel, the receiver comprising deriving means
for deriving a detection signal from an input signal received from the channel, a
detector for determining detected symbols by comparing the detected signal with at least
one reference value, the receiver also including adapting means for adapting the ratio
between the amplitude of the detected signal and the reference value to minimize the
symbol error rate.The invention likewise relates to a receiver for such a transmission
system.A transmission system as defined in the opening paragraph is known from
the journal article "A PRML System for Digital Magnetic Recording" in IEEE Journal
on selected Areas in Communications Vol. 10, No. 1, January 1992.Transmission systems of this type may be used, for example, for
transferring digital symbols through the public telephone network or for reconstructing
digital symbols originating from a magnetic tape or disc. When digital source symbols
are transmitted via a transmission medium or when data symbols are stored on a
recording medium, the digital symbols to be transmitted or recorded respectively, are
converted to analog pulses which are subsequently applied to the transmission medium
or recording medium respectively, further to be denoted by the term of channel.The input signal of the receiver coming from the channel is converted in
the receiver to a detection signal of which it is possible to determine by a detector
which value of a transmitted symbol belongs to the associated value of the detection
signal. For the conversion of the input signal to a detection signal processes such as
demodulation, equalization, echo cancelling and amplitude control may be necessary.
For reconstructing the transmitted symbols on the basis of the detection signal, it is
necessary to compare the current detection signal, reduced, as required, by an estimate
of the contributions of the preceding symbols to the detection signal, with one or more
reference values. Depending on the relative value of the detection signal with respect to 
the reference value(s) at a detection instant, a specific symbol value is assigned to the
detection signal.Since the signal loss on the transmission path may present a strong
fluctuation, the amplitude of the input signal may differ strongly for different situations.
The receiver, however, is to be capable of correctly linking the value of the detection
signal and the associated value of the
