<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a dendritic macromolecule of the polyester type, which macromolecule is composed of a central initiator molecule or initiator polymer having one or more reactive groups (A), which groups (A) under formation of an initial tree structure are bonded to reactive groups (B) of a monomeric chain extender holding the two reactive groups (A) and (B). The tree structure is potentially extended and further branched from the initiator molecule or initiator polymer by an addition of further molecules of a monomeric chain extender by means of bonding between the reactive groups (A) and (B) thereof and is possibly further extended by a reaction with a chain stopper. The invention also comprises a process for preparation of the dendritic macromolecule and the use of such a macromolecule.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a dendritic macromolecule,
which is composed of a central initiator molecule or initiator
polymer having one or more reactive groups (A), which groups
(A) under formation of an initial tree structure are bonded to
reactive groups (B) of a monomeric chain extender containing
the two reactive groups (A) and (B). The tree structure is
optionally extended and further branched from the initiator
molecule or initiator polymer by an addition of further
molecules of a monomeric chain extender by means of bonding
between the reactive groups (A) and (B) thereof and is optionally
further extended by a reaction with a chain stopper.The invention also comprises a process for preparation of the
dendritic macromolecule and the use of such a macromolecule.Various dendritic macromolecules, so called dendrimers are
described by Tamalia et al in Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 29
pages 138-175 (1990). The macromolecules hold a tree structure.
Products quite different from the present invention are described in
said publication, which publication discloses the
preparation of polyamidoamines of the dendrimer type. As
initiator molecule are used NH3 and as chain extender methyl
acrylate and ethylene diamine. The yielded macromolecules are
NH2 terminated. Chain stoppers are, according to this process,
not used.However, the present invention refers to a dendritic, that is
a hyperbranched, macromolecule of the polyester type.Ordinary polyesters are well-known and have been manufactured
for a very long time. They exhibit many good properties but are 
also subject to some drawbacks, which until now have been
regarded as impossible to avoid.An alkyd is a typical example of a polyester type having a very
large commercial significance. Alkyds are normally used as
components in paint binders.The composition of an alkyd can be illustrated by the following
structural formula

where
R1is the alkyl moiety of an unsaturated fatty acid of such
a type that it is reactive to air oxygen thereby providing
the polyester with air drying propertiesR2is the alkyl or aryl moiety of a difunctional carboxylic
acidnis the average degree of polymerisation.An alkyd is most often a high molecular and randomly branched
compound with a broad dispersivity, which is not illustrated by
above simplified formula. An alkyd exhibits due to this a very
high viscosity and large amounts of solvents must thus be added
to obtain so low a viscosity that it can be utilised.Further examples are so called conventional polyesters. They
