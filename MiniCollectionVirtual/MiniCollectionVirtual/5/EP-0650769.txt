<ABSTRACT>
A new and useful configuration for a slot coating 
die is provided, which is designed to apply a 

substantially streakless coating of a hot melt material 
(e.g., hot melt varnish) to a moving substrate such as 

a web of printed label stock. The coating die is 
specially configured to (i) provide a substantially 

smooth, streakless coating of a hot melt material onto 
a moving substrate, and (ii) allow small particles in 

the hot melt material to be released from the coating 
die and the web so that the particles should not 

accumulate in the coating die or cause streaking of the 
coating. The coating die has an upper lip (36), a lower lip (38), 

and a slot (34) disposed between the upper and lower lips. 
The upper lip (36) is undercut (or offset) relative to the 

lower lip (38) , and has a front face which is configured to 
form (i) a wiping surface (60), (ii) a release surface (62) which 

extends beyond the wiping surface (60) and curves away from 
the moving substrate, and (iii) a relief surface (64) which 

extends from the slot (34) to the wiping surface. During 
operation of the slot coating die, hot melt material is 

extruded through the slot(34) , and the configuration of the 
upper die member (i) guides the hot melt material in the 

direction of movement of the substrate and toward the 
wiping surface, (ii) gently wipes the hot melt material 

to a smooth, streakless state, and (iii) enables small 
particles in the hot melt material to be released from 

the slot coating die in a manner designed to avoid 
accumulation of particles in the coating die and/or 

streaking of the coating.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a slot
coating die for applying a coating of hot melt material
to a moving substrate, and particularly to a slot
coating die for applying a substantially streakless
coating of hot melt varnish to a web of printed label
stock.In an earlier application (Serial No. 08/005,237
filed January 15, 1993 for "System and Method for
Applying a Desired, Protective Finish to Printed Label
Stock) which is assigned to the assignee of the present
invention, a method and apparatus are disclosed for
applying a coating of hot melt varnish to a moving web
of printed label stock. The method and apparatus utilize
a slot coating die for applying the hot melt varnish to
the web of printed label stock. The preferred slot
coating die disclosed in that application is a Nordson®
model EP-51-2 slot coating die.The Nordson® model EP-51-2 slot coating die is
believed to be effective for applying a substantially
streakless coating of hot melt varnish to a web of
moving label stock for significant periods of time. The
slot coating die has upper and lower lips and a slot
formed between the upper and lower lips. The hot melt
varnish is extruded through the slot and onto the
printed side of the web of printed label stock. The
upper lip has a distal edge that functions as a doctor
blade to wipe the varnish coating to a substantially
smooth, streakless state as the web of printed label
stock leaves the slot coating die. The present invention is concerned with an apparatus comprising a slot coating die
and a means for moving a substrate past the slot coating die;
said slot coating die being adapted to apply a coating of a hot melt material to the
substrate as the substrate is moved past the slot coating die and comprising an
upper lip, a lower lip, and a slot disposed between said upper and lower lips;the means for moving the substrate being adapted for moving said substrate
progressively past said lower lip, said slot, and said upper lip of said slot coating
die as said substrate is moved past said slot coating die. Such apparatus is
described in US-A-4,299,186.The present invention proceeds from an apparatus as described and is
characterized in that said upper lip of said slot coating die is configured to define
a wiping surface which wipes the coating to a substantially smooth finish and
release surface which curves away from the wiping surface and away from the
substrate to wipe the coating to a substantially smooth finish while allowing, in
use, small particles in the coating material to be

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus comprising a slot coating die (12) and a means for moving a
substrate (14) past the slot coating die (12);


said slot coating die (12) being adapted to apply a coating of a hot melt material to
the substrate (14) as the substrate (14) is moved past the slot coating die (12) and

comprising an upper lip (36), a lower lip (38), and a slot (34) disposed between
said upper and lower lips (36, 38);
the means for moving the substrate (14) being adapted for moving said substrate
progressively past said lower lip (38), said slot (34), and said upper lip (36) of said

slot coating die (12) as said substrate (14) is moved past said slot coating die (12),

characterized in that said upper lip (36) of said slot coating die (12) is configured
to define a wiping surface (60) which wipes the coating to a substantially smooth

finish and a release surface (62) which curves away from the wiping surface (60)
and away from the substrate (14) to wipe the coating to a substantially smooth

finish while allowing, in use, small particles in the coating material to be released
