<ABSTRACT>
An impure methyl tertiary butyl ether product contaminated 
with isobutylene, methanol and water is purified by 

continuous counter-current contact with water and an isobutylene 
fraction in an extraction zone comprising a counter-current 

contact tower to provide an overhead raffinate 
comprising isobutylene, methyl tertiary butyl ether and a 

minor amount of water and an extract comprising methanol, 
water and a minor amount of methyl tertiary butyl ether; the 

overhead raffinate being separated in a methyl tertiary butyl 
ether purification distillation zone into a lighter distillation 

fraction comprising isobutylene and water and a heavier 
distillation fraction consisting essentially of methyl 

tertiary butyl ether; the lighter distillation fraction being 
decanted to remove water and to provide a distillate isobutylene 

fraction that is returned to the contact tower as the 
isobutylene fraction.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the manufacture and 
isobutylene-assisted purification of methyl tertiary butyl 
ether. More particularly, this invention relates to a 
process for the manufacture of methyl tertiary butyl ether 
from tertiary butyl alcohol and methanol and to the 
purification of a methanol-contaminated methyl tertiary 
butyl ether intermediate product formed during the 
process; the intermediate product being purified by 
counter-current contact with water in an extraction tower, 
wherein isobutylene is added to the extraction tower to 
assist in the formation of a raffinate composed of methyl 
tertiary butyl ether, isobutylene and residual water and 
an extract comprising methanol, residual isobutylene, 
residual methyl tertiary butyl alcohol and water. Still more particularly, this invention relates to a 
process for the manufacture of methyl tertiary butyl ether 
from tertiary butyl alcohol and methanol and to the 
purification of a methanol-contaminated methyl tertiary 
butyl ether intermediate product formed during the 
process; the intermediate product being purified by 
counter-current contact with water in an extraction tower, 
wherein isobutylene is added to the extraction tower in 
admixture with the methanol-contaminated methyl tertiary  
 
butyl ether to assist in the formation of a raffinate 
composed of methyl tertiary butyl ether, isobutylene and 
residual water and an extract comprising methanol, 
residual isobutylene, residual methyl tertiary butyl ether 
and water. Even more particularly, this invention relates to a 
method of purification of methanol-contaminated methyl 
tertiary butyl ether by counter-current contact with water 
in an extraction tower, wherein isobutylene is separately 
added to the extraction tower below the point at which the 
methanol-contaminated methyl tertiary butyl ether is 
introduced in order to selectively strip at least a 
portion of the residual methyl tertiary butyl ether from 
the extract. Methyl tert-butyl ether is finding increasing use as 
a blending component in high octane gasoline as the 
current gasoline additives based on lead and manganese are 
phased out. Currently all commercial processes for the 
manufacture of methyl tert-butyl ether are based upon the 
liquid-phase reaction of isobutylene and methanol 
catalyzed by a cationic ion-exchange resin. With the expanding use of MTBE as an acceptable 
gasoline additive, a growing problem is the availability 
of raw materials. Historically, the critical raw material 
is isobutylene (Oil
