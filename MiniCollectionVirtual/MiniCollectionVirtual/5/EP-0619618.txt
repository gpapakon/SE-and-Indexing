<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a radio-frequency attenuator in the form of a planar thin-film circuit on a substrate (11), in the case of which circuit a stripline which is composed of a resistance material having a high resistivity is arranged on the top of the substrate, which consists of at least three strip elements (4, 5, 6) which are all connected to one another at one of their two ends in a centre region which is common to all the strip elements, which stripline is connected via its strip elements to the input (1) and output (2) of the attenuator and to reference potential, for example earth (12). In order to be able to use such an attenuator for high-precision applications in the RF-field and microwave field as well, it is proposed according to the invention that the centre region (which connects the at least three strip elements of the stripline to one another) of the stripline is completely covered by a first contact surface (3) made of an electrically highly conductive material having a low resistivity.
