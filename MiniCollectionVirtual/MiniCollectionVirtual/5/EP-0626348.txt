<ABSTRACT>
Surface layers of the earth contaminated with 
precipitates of alkaline earth metal sulfates including radium 

sulfate derived from subterranean waters brought to the surface 
of the earth, are decontaminated using an aqueous chemical 

composition including a polyaminopolycarboxylic acid such as ETDA 
or DTPA in combination with a synergist, preferably oxalate or 

monocarboxylic acid anion such as salicylate. The surface layers 
may be decontaminated in situ by applying the solvent to the 

earth to bring the precipitates into dissolved form after which 
the dissolved precipitates are leached into lower layers of the 

earth by percolation with water. Alternatively, the earth may be 
removed from its original site and decontaminated in a tank or 

lined pond after which the decontaminated earth may be returned 
to its approximate original site. 
There is also disclosed a method of decontaminating 
natural gas processing equipment using the aqueous chemical 

composition.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of decontaminating
natural gas processing equipment. Natural gas is a
major and attractive energy source in the United States and other
countries which is distributed on a wide scale by means of
pipelines to the ultimate users. The composition of natural gas
at the wellhead varies widely from field to field and many
components may need to be removed by processing before delivery
to the pipeline, as noted in Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology,
Kirk-Othmer, Third Edition, Vol. 1, pp. 630-652, John Wiley &
Sons, New York, 1978. Condensate must be removed from wet gas,
both to eliminate the possibility of condensation in the pipeline
itself and to separate these components as another marketable
product. Water vapor must also be removed to preclude the
formation of gas hydrate and hydrogen sulfide is removed because
of its poisonous and corrosive characteristics. Other components
such as carbon dioxide and helium may also require removal if
they are present. Regardless of the specific processing sequence used to
condition the gas for pipelining, it is normally passed through a
number of items of process equipment prior to removal of the
water which generally is present in all wellhead gas.
Conventionally, the gas will pass through filters to remove
entrained solid contaminants as well as compressors and other
items of process equipment employed in the purification train.
One problem which is encountered with these items of equipment
which precede the water removal is that mineral species and other
contaminants from the producing formations may be dissolved in or
entrained with the water and may contaminate the equipment with
which it comes into contact. Among the contaminants of this kind
are dissolved salts including, especially, mineral species of low
solubility which may deposit as scale on the filters and other
surface equipment. Among the minerals of this kind which cause a
particular problem are the sulfates of the alkaline earth metals,
including, in particular, calcium, strontium and barium. As these reaction products or mineral species precipitate
on the surfaces of the water-carrying or water-containing system,
they form adherent deposits or scale. Scale may prevent
effective heat transfer, interfere with fluid flow, facilitate
corrosive processes, or harbor bacteria. Scale is an expensive
problem in many industrial water systems, in production systems
for oil and gas, in pulp and paper mill systems, and in other
systems, causing delays and shutdowns for cleaning

<CLAIMS>
A method of decontaminating natural gas processing
equipment and media having an adherent mineral deposit of

alkaline earth metal sulfates containing radioactive
components, which method comprises:


(i) contacting the deposit with an aqueous
composition, at a pH from 10 to 14, which

comprises (a) a chelating agent and (b) a
catalyst selected from the group consisting of

oxalate, mercaptoacetate, hydroxyacetate,
aminoacetate, salicylate, thiosulphate and

nitrilotriacetate ions to convert the alkaline
earth metal sulfates in the deposit to soluble

form; and
(ii) removing the deposit from the equipment.
A method according to claim 1 in which the chelating
agent (a) composition comprises a polyaminopolycarboxylic

acid.
A method according to claim 1 or 2 in which the
monocarboxylic anion is selected from hydrooxyacetate,

mercaptoacetate, aminoacetate, and salicylate.
A method according to claim 1 or claim 2 in which the
anion is selected from thiosulfate and nitriloacetate.
