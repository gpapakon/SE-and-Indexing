<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to production of metal 
cord for reinforcing of tyres and other mechanical rubber 

goods. 
The essence of the present invention resides in that 
in a twisted-wire product, comprising strands (1) wound 

together spirally and laid of spirally wound wires (2), the 
ratio between the diameter (8) of wires (2) and the diameter (D) of 

the product itself is within 0.135 and 0.206. In addition, 
the ratio between the number of wires (2) in each strand (1) to the 

number of strands (1) in the product is so selected that the 
ratio between the perimeter (P) of the exposed outer surface 

of the cross-sectional area equal to unity and a sum 
moment (W) of bending resistance is in excess of 215.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to production 
of metal cord for reinforcing of tyres and other mechanical 
rubber goods and more specifically to twisted-wire 
products. The principal aim of twisted-wire products made use 
of for reinforcing of tyres and other mechanical rubber 
goods is to increase the strength of a rubber-cord component 
in the finished product, its high flexibility remaining 
unaffected. Provision of a required flexibility and hence 
service durability is attained due to a reduced diameter 
of the wire the product is twisted of, which results in a 
decreased moment of bending resistance of the product 
according to the following commonly known relation: 
 
where 
ni -the number of wires having the diameter of 'i'; δi -the diameter of 'i' wire. An indispensable prerequisite for producing a rubber-metal 
composite having high performance characteristics is 
reliable adhesion of its components. Adhesive power of 
metal reinforcer is directly proportional to the area open 
for contact with rubber surface: 
S = P·l,  
where 
P -perimeter of the outer exposed surface; l -length of the twisted-wire product. With the value of 'l' being invariable the adhesive 
power is a function of the perimeter of the outer surface 
of the cross-sectional area of the twisted-wire product, 
which is found from the following relation: 
 
where 
ki -part of the cross-sectional area of the 'i' wire 
open for contact with rubber; δi -wire diameter. For comparative assessment of the various constructions 
of twisted-wire products as to adhesive parameters and 
flexibility a generalized index I is used, equal to the 
ratio between the perimeter P of the outer surface of the 
metallic component, said perimeter determining the adhesive 
power of the product, and the moment W of resistance to 
bending, since fatigue strength and flexibility are inversely 
proportional to said ratio. Known in the art are multiwire helically twisted 
wire constructions featuring small-diameter wires, 
such as 3+9+15 (Be, A, 0,176,139; Fr, A, 0,260,556) and 
4+10+20 (cf. The Catalog of metal cord constructions 
of Pirelli, Italy), characterized by low values of the 
moment W of bending resistance and of the perimeter P 
of the exposed outer surface of the metallic component.  
 The value of the index I for such constructions is 
rather high. However, such products are highly labor-consuming 
due to a great number of components they consist 
of, whereas a reduced number of such components in, e.g., 
3+6 or +x5 constructions
