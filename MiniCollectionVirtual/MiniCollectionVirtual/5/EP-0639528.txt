<ABSTRACT>
In a capsule applying machine (100) each bottle (10) 
is locked by a stem (41) which slides in a through hole 

(5) of a turntable (4) and carries a small 
cup-shaped pad (27) that pushes the capsule (11). 

The bottle (10) is put on a plate (21) which has a 
cylindrical shank (22) inserted in a cup-shaped 

plunger (24) of a pneumatic actuator (23) carried by 
the disc (3) and connected to a modulating valve 

(25) so as to obtain a constant pressure. 
A first gear (51) is keyed to the stem (41) and 
engages with a toothed wheel (53) with which a 

second gear (52) is engaged.This second gear is driven by two 
pulleys (56,57) linked by a belt (58) and a shaft 

(59,49) connected to a motor (48) which is 
electronically controlled. 
 
There is provided, for folding the edge of the 
capsule (11), a blade (61), 

carried by a rocker element (62) 
having its pivot point on a supporting cradle (64) 

and subjected to the action of a pneumatic actuator 
(65) connected to a modulating valve (69), so as to 

maintain a constant pressure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the technical 
sector concerning the construction of automatic 
machines for packing products in containers, e.g. 
bottles. In particular, the invention relates to a machine 
that fits metal capsules, i.e. that blocks the 
sealing capsule on the bottle by folding the border 
of the capsule skirt that extends beyond the bulge 
of the bottle. Various machines are known for performing this 
operation according to different methods, usually 
comprising a carousel that is driven to rotate and 
that features a number of housings designed to 
receive and support single containers, already 
filled. The containers are fed to the carousel by separating 
means, e.g. Archimedean screws with horizontal axis, 
and, at the end of the cycle they are taken by other 
means. The bottles already filled are then brought 
to other sections of the machine, or to other 
machines, so as to complete the packing. In the first section of the carousel, or immediately 
upstream of it, a stopper made of rubber and a 
capsule, generally of aluminium, are put on the 
bottle already filled. During the passage along the circumferential section 
of the carousel, the capsule and the stopper are  
 
pressed on the bottle, and the border of the 
capsule, that extends downwards beyond the bulge of 
the bottle, is folded, thus fastening the capsule to 
the bottle. Due to the upward elastic reaction of the stopper of 
rubber, the folded border is pressed against the 
bulge, thus blocking the capsule. Usually, the border of the capsule is folded by 
means of a blade of suitable shape, e.g. extending 
in a circular sector, or by a rotary disc placed, 
together with a rotary axle, inside the 
circumference covered by the bottles. The edge of the blade or of the disc grips the 
underside of the bottle bulge thus folding the 
border of the capsule and realising the blocking of 
the metal capsule. Nevertheless, various problems arise concerning both 
the correct positioning of the bottle and blocking 
of the capsule. In fact, the height of each bottle diverges a bit 
from the medium height, according to which the 
machine has been set up, similarly the heights of 
the rubber stopper and the same capsule diverge. Moreover, also the hardness of the stopper changes, 
therefore different elastic reaction determines 
different intensity of the blocking force of the 
capsule to the bottle. Since the ideal to be realised is a uniform blocking  
 
of all the bottles, it is necessary to provide means 
that react with minor
