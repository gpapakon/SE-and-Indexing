to assume an active or inactive position, depending on 
whether the associated receiving cavity (34) is free or 

occupied by a pin (10).

cavity (34). 
Bowling alley according to one of claims 1 to 5,

manner. 
Bowling alley according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the sorter (35) has a driven 

turntable (36) for receiving pins (10) which have been 
cleared-away, from which turntable pins (10) are 

conveyable, lying one above the other in the aligned 
position can be conveyed, into a collecting shaft (40) 

via a pin deflector (39), the pins (10) being removable 
in succession from the base of said shaft by the 

entrainment means (69) of the circulatory chain (65) of 
the pin conveyor (64). 
Bowling alley according to one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the turntable (36), which is 

surrounded by a fixed lateral wall (37), is disposed at 
an inclination relative to the horizontal, and an 

aperture (38) for pins to pass therethrough is provided 
with the associated angular pin deflector (39) in the 

region of the highest inclination of the turntable (36) 
in the lateral wall (37), said deflector ejecting pins 

(10) in their aligned position into the collecting shaft 
(40) by briefly changing the direction of rotation of 

the turntable (36), and said deflector conducting pins 
(10) in their non-aligned position past the aperture 

(38) for pins to pass therethrough.  
 
Bowling alley according to one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that a pin reverser (48) is situated 

downstream of the pin deflector (39), when viewed with 
respect to the direction of rotation of the turntable 

(36), and converts pins (10), which lie on the edge (47) 
of the turntable (36) in their non-aligned position, 

into an aligned position. 
Bowling alley according to one of claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that the pin reverser (48) has an 

easily retarded rotary pivot point (49), the gripping 
arms (50) of which are bent in opposition to the
