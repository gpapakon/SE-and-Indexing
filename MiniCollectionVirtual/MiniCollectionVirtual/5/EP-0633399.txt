<ABSTRACT>
A double-headed type compressor having a solid cam plate is 
disclosed. A disk plate (4) is rotatably supported on a drive 

shaft (3) for driving each piston (5) along a reciprocating 
path. The disk plate (4) is curved in a single direction to 

form solid cam surfaces (S1)(S2). The cam surfaces (S1)(S2) 
transform a single rotation of the disk plate (4) into two 

reciprocating movements of the piston (5). Cam followers 
(23)(24) provided between the disk plate (4) and the piston 

(5) are formed to be comformable to the cam surfaces (S1)(S2). 
The cam followers (23)(24) roll on the piston (5), and slide 

on the cam surfaces (S1)(S2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a compressor and more 
particularly to a compressor in which oscillating pistons 
reciprocate due to the rotation of a cam surfaced plate 
secured around a drive shaft. In compressors having double-headed pistons that reciprocate 
in associated cylinder bores by the rotating action of a swash 
plate, each piston reciprocates only once for each complete 
revolution the swash plate makes. One way to increase the 
compressor's compression displacement per rotation of the 
swash plate, is to design larger sized compressors. Since 
compressors are often mounted in vehicles, however, their 
large design is distinctly undesirable. One proposed solution to the above shortcoming is the recently 
developed wave plate type compressor disclosed in Japanese 
Unexamined Patent Publication No. 57-110783. In this 
compressor, the swash plate is replaced with a plate having 
the shape of a solid cam. This cam is a disk-shaped plate  
 
having circumferentally extending undulating surfaces formed 
on the plate. If the wave plate has two undulations i.e., two 
crests and two troughs, each double-headed piston performs two 
compressing actions for each turn the wave plate makes. It 
is therefore possible to increase the compression displacement 
without enlarging the compressor. To manufacture the wave shaped dish of this type of 
compressor, the dish must be formed with undulations in the 
circumferential direction, and its wavy cam surfaces should 
be polished. It is very difficult, however, to form and 
polish the undulated surfaces with any high degree of 
precision. Consequently, the manufacture of such a compressor 
containing these types of plates has proven quite difficult. Since the crest and trough of the undulated cam surface have 
inverse curvatures, it is as yet not possible to form cam 
followers having shapes that accurately correspond to the 
crests and troughs of the undulated cam surface. The type of 
surface contact shared between the cam surface and the cam 
follower is a point or line contact, rather than a plane 
contact. This construction precludes there being any large 
or significant amount of contact area shared between the cam 
surface and the cam follower. Consequently, both cam surface 
and follower are subject to a large contact pressure per unit 
area. Such pressure tends to cause the premature wearing of 
the cam surface and cam follower, and thus decreases the  
 
longevity and effective service life of the compressor. This 
premature wearing also tends to
