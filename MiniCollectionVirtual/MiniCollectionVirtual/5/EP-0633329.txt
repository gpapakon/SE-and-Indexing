<ABSTRACT>
A zinc-plated metal sheet comprises a metal sheet having, 
on at least one surface thereof, a carbon-containing composite 

zinc plated coating having a weight of 5 - 200 g/m² and a carbon 
content of 0.001 - 10 wt%. The composite zinc coating has a 

carbon-rich surface layer with a thickness of 0.1 - 10 µm, 
which thickness constitutes from 5% to 50% of the thickness of 

the plated coating, or the η-phase present in the composite 
zinc coating has an orientation index of not greater than 0.6 

for the (00·2) plane and not less than 0.2 for the (10·1) 
plane. The composite zinc coating can be produced by 

electroplating with zinc metal in an acidic plating solution 
which contains 0.001 - 10 wt% of lignin sulfonic acid or a salt 

thereof and 0.001 - 10 wt% in total of one or more organic 
compounds selected from the group consisting of higher 

alcohols, and ethers and esters each having a molecular weight 
of at least 100. The composite zinc-plated metal sheet has 

improved post-painting corrosion resistance, press formability, 
and spot weldability.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a composite zinc-plated metal 
sheet which has good press formability and good corrosion 
resistance as well as a remarkably improved spot weldability. 
This invention also relates to a method for the production of 
such a plated metal sheet by electroplating with zinc metal. Surface-treated steel sheets are used in various 
applications including automobiles, electric appliances, and 
building materials. In particular, the use of rust-preventing 
steel sheets having a rust preventive surface coating formed 
thereon has been promoted in automobiles, particularly in 
automobile panels, to be sold in cold regions, in which they 
are exposed to a severe corrosive environment due to the use of 
rock salt on roads in order to prevent freezing. As rust-preventing 
steel sheets are used in increased quantities, 
requirements therefor with respect to rust preventing 
properties have become increasingly strict. For example, such 
steel sheets are required to have a long-term corrosion 
resistance intended to resist perforative corrosion for 10 
years and surface rusting for 5 years. In addition to corrosion resistance, rust-preventing steel 
sheets are required to have press formability capable of 
withstanding severe press forming such as deep drawing, and 
spot weldability enabling bonding by resistance spot welding, 
particularly by continuous spot welding with an increased 
number of weld spots. They are also desired to have post-painting 
corrosion resistance, i.e., the capability of forming 
a painted film having good adhesion in a painting step 
subsequent to a press forming step such that they exhibit 
corrosion resistance in areas where the painted film is injured 
and in edge faces. The most popular rust-preventing steel sheets are zinc-plated 
steel sheets prepared by electroplating or hot dipping 
(galvanizing) with zinc metal. In order to further improve the corrosion resistance of  
 
zinc-plated steel sheets, a variety of zinc alloy-plated steel 
sheets have been proposed. These have a coating of a zinc 
alloy with one or more metals such as Fe, Co, Mn, Cr, or Al. 
Some of these sheets such as those having a Zn-Ni or Zn-Fe 
alloy coating, have already been used in practical 
applications. Zinc alloy-plated steel sheets generally have improved as-plated 
corrosion resistance to perforation and can protect the 
substrate steel sheet with a relatively thin coating. The use 
of a zinc alloy with one or both of Ni and Co as a plating 
material is particularly effective for
