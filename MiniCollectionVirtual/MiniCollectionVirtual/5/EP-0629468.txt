<ABSTRACT>
A method for creating a weld (18) more than 10 metres 
long between metal plates (1) in a weld groove (2) formed at 

least 5 mm thick by butt joint welding from one side only of 
the plates includes forming the weld groove (2), for example 

by form-milling of the edges of the plates to be welded, with 
high accuracy with respect to the dimensions and shape of the 

groove and with a smooth groove surface. The groove (2) 
extends from said one side through only part of the thickness 

of the plates to leave a root area (10) where the plates (1) 
to be welded together receive support from one another without 

any essential intermediate gap. The plates (1), in the 
vicinity of the groove (2) but on the side opposite to said 

one side, are engaged by a bed (19) which includes suction 
fixing devices (6, 7, 8, 9), known per se, to keep the plates 

(1) to be welded in correct relative disposition.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method according to the
preamble of claim 1 for the mass production welding together
of extremely long metal plates and to bodies produced from
such plates welded together by the method.In the shipbuilding industry large numbers of plates are
welded together to form assemblies such as ship's decks, hulls
and the like. Because the assemblies to be manufactured have
an extremely large area, it is economically desirable to work
with as large plate blanks as possible and the term "extremely
long metal plates" should be taken to mean plates with a
length of at least 10 metres (or the maximum length
commercially available should plate manufacturers not have
longer material available). A typical plate blank used in the
shipbuilding industry is over 10 metres long, often close to
20 metres long. The joining of plate blanks of these sizes
to one another by welding is demanding work, because the high
temperatures generated by the welding cause deformations in
the plate blanks during the welding operation itself and/or
after the welding operation when, for example, welding
shrinkage causes unevenness in the plate blanks, the
elimination of which by, for example, the flame straightening
method is both difficult and time-consuming.Further, traditional preparatory actions for joining
extremely long plates together by welding are difficult,
require a lot of space and are time-consuming. Traditionally,
a small gap is left between plates to be welded together to
make it possible to carry out the entire welding phase from
one side only of the plates. The forming of the gap requires
exact positioning of the plates with respect to each other,
to ensure control of the correct width of the gap. Control
of the uniformity of the width of the gap along the entire
weld groove requires a firm attachment of the plates to be
welded to a supporting base. In addition to firm support of
the plates by the base, tack welding is traditionally used, 
that is, the plates are bound to one another by short tack
welds spaced-apart along the weld groove which requires time-consuming
manual work. If tack welding takes place other than
at the site proposed for the main weld itself, one has to
reserve a work area for this which is as large as that used
for the welding process, which means that the welding process
as a whole requires twice the working space required if all
operations can be done at a single work station.US-A-4075453 describes a method of butt welding steel
plates together edge-to-edge from one side only
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method for joining together metal plates (1), each
being at least 5mm thick, by butt joint welding in a

preformed weld groove (2) from one side only of the plates,
the weld groove (2) being formed to extend from said one

side through only part of the thickness of the plates and
leaving a root area (10) where the plates (1) to be welded

together are arranged to receive support from one another
without any essential intermediate gap, characterised in

that the method is a method for mass producing large plate
bodies by joining together extremely long metal plates (1)

and comprises forming the weld groove (2) by means of a
metal cutting tool, for example by form-milling, with high

accuracy with respect to the dimensions and shape of the
groove and with a smooth groove surface, engaging the plates

(1), in the vicinity of the groove (2) but on the side
opposite to said one side, by a bed (19) which includes

suction fixing device (6,7,8,9), known per se, to keep the
plates (1) to be welded in correct relative disposition, and

using the root area (10) of the weld groove (2) as an
auxiliary support surface facilitating correct positioning

of the long and heavy plates (1) relative to one another.
A method according to claim 1, characterised in
that th
e part (7) of each suction fixing device which is
nearest to the weld groove (2) is spaced therefrom by (L) at

least 50 mm.
A method according to claim 1 or 2, characterised
in that adjacent to the root area (10) the bed (19) includes

a root support (3) of a material with high thermal
conductivity, the root support including a recess (14) just

under the weld groove (2), for receiving welding powder or
shielding gas, which recess extends in the longitudinal

direction of the weld groove (2).
A method according to claim 3, characterised in
that during welding of steel plates (1), the recess (4) of 

the root support (3) is filled with welding powder before
setting the plates (1) in the required position for welding.
A method according to claim 3 or 4, characterised
in that the root support (3) is cooled by a fluent coolant

made to flow in a duct (5) of the root support (3).
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 5,

is in the range 2 to 4 mm, preferably not more than 3 mm.
A method according to any one of the preceding

with an angle (m) between the side surfaces in the
range 50째 to 65째.
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 6,

close together to enter the same weld pool (17) through the

same contact nozzle (13), the welding wires (11) receiving
current from the same welding power source.
