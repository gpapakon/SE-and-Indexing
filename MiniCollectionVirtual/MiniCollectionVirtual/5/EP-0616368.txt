<ABSTRACT>
An object of the present invention is to ease the
dielectric strength requirements for transistors forming

power supply circuits or the like. A nonvolatile
semiconductor memory of the present invention includes a

plurality of memory cells, each of which is composed of a
floating gate (102), a control gate (101), a drain (104),

and a source (103), and a negative voltage generating means
(120) whose generated negative voltage is applied to the

control gate (101) for drawing a charge stored in the
floating gate into a channel or the source when stored data

is erased electrically. The nonvolatile memory of the
present invention further includes positive erasure voltage

generating means (140), and a positive voltage higher than
a conventional supply voltage, generated by the positive

erasure voltage generating means, is applied to the channel
or the source.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to
electrically erasable nonvolatile semiconductor
memories, and more particularly to a nonvolatile
semiconductor memory of the configuration that eases
the dielectric strength requirements.Electrically rewritable nonvolatile memories
include, for example, E2PROM; and among others, flash
memory having total or selective total erasure
capabilities has been attracting attention in recent
years because of its high bit-density capabilities.
The memory cell of the flash memory has a two-layered
gate structure consisting of a control gate and a
floating gate, in which information storage is
accomplished by utilizing the property that when
prescribed voltages are applied to the control gate,
drain, and source, the current flowing between the
drain and the source varies depending on whether or not
a charge is stored on the floating gate. Generally, in
flash memories, injecting a charge into the floating
gate is called writing.For writing, a high voltage VPP (about 12 V) is
applied to the control gate, about 6 V is applied to
the drain, and 0 V is applied to the source. Under
these conditions, electrons flowing through the memory
cell encounter a high electric field near the drain,
and some of the electrons, accelerated by this field,
gain enough energy to overcome the energy barrier of
the gate insulating film and are injected into the
floating gate. Since the floating gate is electrically
isolated from other circuit regions, the injected
charge can be stored thereon semipermanently.For reading, a supply voltage VCC (about 5 V) is
applied to the control gate, about 1 V is applied to 
the drain, and 0 V is applied to the source. The
threshold voltage of the cell transistor varies
depending on the presence or absence of a charge on the
floating gate, so that the current flowing through the
selected memory cell varies accordingly. By sensing and
amplifying this current, the information is read out.There are two main methods of erasure: one is the
channel erasure method in which the charge stored on
the floating gate is drawn into the channel, i.e., into
the substrate or a well, and the other is the source
erasure method in which the charge is drawn into the
source.In channel erasure, 0 V is applied to the control
gate, the drain and source S are left open, and a high
voltage VPP (about 12 V) is applied to the channel (p-well).
This causes the charge stored on the floating
gate to be drawn into the channel. In source erasure,
the high voltage VPP is applied to the source, and
