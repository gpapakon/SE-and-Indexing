<ABSTRACT>
A method is provided for continuous mass 
polymerization of acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene 

type thermoplastics. The method involves charging 
a liquid feed comprising a vinylidene aromatic 

monomer, an unsaturated vinyl nitrile monomer and a 
synthetic butadiene polymer dissolved therein into 

a grafting reactor to prereact the liquid mass to 
form grafted rubber continuous phase polymeric 

product. The product from the grafting reactor is 
then charged to a phase inversion reactor where 

free rigid copolymer in monomer is the only 
continuous phase, and where dispersed particles of 

grafted rubber with occluded rigid copolymer and 
monomer are immediately formed from the product of 

the grafting reactor. The second polymerization 
product, which is coming out from the phase 

inversion reactor, is then charged to a finishing 
reactor wherein the material is further polymerized 

to form a third polymerization product which then 
can be devolatilized to provide a final 

thermoplastic composition. The process of the 
present invention provides unique capacity and 

flexibility in controlling and adjusting rubber 

grafting and rubber particle morphology. Process 
conditions can be controlled to produce a high 

gloss or a low gloss resin product.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods for making
rubber reinforced copolymers, and more particularly
relates to methods for making rubber modified graft
copolymers of monovinyl aromatic monomers and
unsaturated nitrile monomers grafted on a rubbery
substrate by mass polymerization.Rubber modified graft copolymers of a
monovinyl aromatic such as styrene and an
unsaturated nitrile such as acrylonitrile having
particulates of rubber, generally an alkadiene
rubber, dispersed throughout a copolymeric matrix
(conventionally referred to as ABS resins) are
employed in a wide variety of commercial
applications such as packaging, refrigerator
linings, automotive parts, furniture, domestic
appliances and toys. It is well known that the
physical properties of an ABS resin such as
toughness (i.e., the combination of elongation and
impact strength), at both room and lower
temperatures, are affected by the grafted styrene-acrylonitrile 
copolymers of the rubber substrates
and by the size, composition and morphology of the
dispersed rubber particles and/or the concentration
of the rubber substrates in the rubber-reinforced
copolymers. For example, to achieve the balance of
physical properties required in many applications,
the rubber particles are necessarily dispersed
through the copolymer matrix at a relative size of
typically 0.5 µm (microns) and 5 µm (microns), typically
yielding a low gloss product as a result of the
rubber sizes being at least 0.4 µm (microns) as the
average particle size, more typically greater than
0.5 µm (microns).There are two well known manufacturing
processes among many different bulk (mass) ABS
processes. The first one is a multi-zone,
continuous plug flow process. The second is a
bulk/suspension process. The multi-zone plug flow
bulk HIPS/ABS process was described in early U.S.
patents 2,646,418; 2,694,692; 2,727,884 and
3,243,481 and in many other patents that followed,
such as U.S. patents 4,874,815; 4,785,051;

3,660,535; 3,243,481 and EP-A-0477764.Multizone plug flow bulk processes include a
series of polymerization vessels (or towers),
consecutively connected to each other, providing
multiple reaction zones. Butadiene (BD) rubber
(stereospecific) is dissolved in styrene (ST) or in 
styrene/acrylonitrile (ST/AN), and the rubber
solution is then fed into the reaction system. The
polymerization can be thermally or chemically
initiated, and viscosity of the
