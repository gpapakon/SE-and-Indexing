<ABSTRACT>
A photographic camera capable of taking various 
size exposures comprises a back frame opening for making 

a full size exposure on a film in the camera, and 
respective masking blades supported for pivotal movement 

between a masking position for masking corresponding 
portions of the back frame opening to allow only a 

reduced size exposure to be made on the film and a non-masking 
position not masking the corresponding portions 

of the back frame opening to allow a full size exposure 
to be made on the film. The masking blades are connected 

via a connecting link having at least one elastic portion 
which constitutes a living hinge to permit the masking 

blades to be pivoted between their masking and non-masking 
positions. Preferably, the masking blades and 

the connecting link are integral to be one-piece.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to the field of 
photography, and in particular to a photographic camera 
capable of taking various size or various format 
exposures. More specifically, the invention relates to a 
photographic camera intended to take interspersed full 
size and panoramic size exposures. Prior art U.S. Pat. No. 5,086,311, issued Feb. 
4, 1992, discloses a photographic camera capable of 
taking interspersed full size and panoramic size 
exposures. Typically, a full size exposure is about 
24.4mm x 36.4mm and a panoramic size exposure is about 
13.3mm x 36.4mm. Thus, the panoramic size exposure has a 
stretched-out or panorama-like appearance as compared to 
the full size exposure. The '311 patent discloses that, within the 
camera body, there is provided a (conventional) 
rectangular back frame opening for making full size 
exposures on a filmstrip. Also, respective masking 
blades are supported for pivotal movement between a 
masking position for masking an upper rectangular portion 
and a lower rectangular portion of the back frame opening 
to allow only panoramic size exposures to be made on the 
filmstrip and a non-masking position not masking the 
upper and lower portions to preclude panoramic size 
exposures from being made on the filmstrip, i.e. to allow 
full size exposures to be made on the filmstrip. In U.S. Pat. No. 5,086,311. the actuating 
mechanism for the masking blades includes separate drive 
levers and pivot shafts which are individually connected 
to the masking blades. The drive levers are connected to 
each other at a motion-transmitting joint or coupling 
which permits the masking blades to be pivoted between 
their masking and non-masking positions. Thus, the  
 
actuating mechanism is a relative complex and therefore 
expensive mechanical device. According to the invention, a photographic 
camera capable of taking various size exposures comprises 
a back frame opening for making a full size exposure on a 
film in the camera, and respective masking blades 
supported for pivotal movement between a masking position 
for masking corresponding portions of the back frame 
opening to allow only a reduced size exposure to be made 
on the film and a non-masking position not masking the 
corresponding portions of the back frame opening to allow 
a full size exposure to be made on the film, and is 
characterized in that:
 
   the masking blades are connected via a 
connecting link having at least one elastic portion which 
constitutes a living hinge to permit the masking

A photographic camera capable of taking 
various size exposures comprises a back frame opening for 

making a full size exposure on a film in said camera, and 
respective masking blades supported for pivotal movement 

between a masking position for masking corresponding 
portions of said back frame opening to allow only a 

reduced size exposure to be made on the film and a non-masking 
position not masking said corresponding portions 

of the back frame opening to allow a full size exposure 
to be made on the film, and is characterized in that: 

   said masking blades are connected via a 
connecting link having at least one elastic portion which 

constitutes a living hinge to permit the masking blades 
to be pivoted between their masking and non-masking 

positions. 
A photographic camera as recited in claim 
1, wherein said masking blades and said connecting link 

are integral to be one-piece. 
A photographic camera as recited in claim 
1, wherein said masking blades include respective pivot 

shafts integral with said connecting link to be one-piece. 
A photographic camera as recited in claim 
3, wherein said pivot shafts are integral with said 

masking blades to be one-piece. 
A photographic camera as recited in claim 
1, wherein said masking blades include respective pivot 

shafts, and said connecting link has a pair of separate 
elastic portions constituting respective living hinges 

located proximate said pivot shafts to permit said 
masking blades to be pivoted at the pivot shafts between 

their masking and non-masking positions. 
A photographic camera capable of taking 
interspersed full size and panoramic size exposures 

comprises a rectangular back frame opening for making a 
full size exposure on a film in said camera, and 

respective masking blades supported for pivotal movement 
 

between a masking position for masking an upper 
rectangular portion and a lower rectangular portion of 

said back frame opening to allow only a panoramic size 
exposure to be made on the film and a non-masking 

position not masking said upper and lower portions of the 
back frame opening to allow a full size exposure to be 

made on the film, and is characterized in that: 
   said masking blades are formed as a unit with a 

connecting link to be one-piece; and 
   at least one elastic portion of said connecting 

link constitutes a living hinge to permit said masking 
blades to be pivoted between their masking and non-masking 

positions.
