<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a surface
acoustic wave (SAW) filter device which may be used to
take out a signal within a particular frequency band.
More specifically, the invention pertains to a surface
acoustic wave filter device which is particularly
suitable for improving the manufacturing yield and
reducing the spurious noise caused by the bulk wave.Conventionally, there is known and practically
used a surface acoustic wave filter device which
includes a piezoelectric substrate and interdigital-type
transducers (IDTs) on the input and output sides, which
are formed on the substrate. Such a filter device
typically incorporates unidirectional transducers as the
IDTs on the input and output sides, in which a floating
electrode is arranged between adjacent positive and
negative electrode fingers for reducing an insertion
loss of the device.The surface acoustic wave filter device including
unidirectional transducers on input and output sides is 
disclosed, for example, in Japanese Examined Patent
Application Publication No. 3-20,929 (JP-B-3-20,929).
This type of surface acoustic wave filter device proved
to be highly advantageous in that, besides the reduced
insertion loss of the device, it is possible to adequately
control the phase- and frequency-characteristics of
the device. However, known surface acoustic wave filter
devices tend to suffer from a problem that a bulk wave
transmitted from the input side transducer through
inside of the substrate is reflected by its bottom
surface and then received by the output side transducer,
thereby causing undesirable bulk wave spurious noise to
occur in the output signal from the output side
transducer. In this instance, there may arise various
inconveniences particularly when the frequency of the
bulk wave spurious noise coincides with an image
frequency or the circuit system which includes the
filter device.A surface acoustic wave filter device developed
for reducing the bulk wave spurious noise is disclosed,
for example, in Japanese Unexamined Utility Model Application
Publication No. 62-201,527 (JP-U-62-201,527).
In this instance, the transducers are provided on one
side of the piezoelectric substrate and grooves are
formed on opposite side of the substrate and arranged
spaced from each other at a predetermined pitch, thereby 
to suppress adverse influences of the bulk wave spurious
noise. Another arrangement of the filter device is also
known, in which the piezoelectric substrate has been
subjected to a surface roughening on its back-side so
that the
