<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for extending the communication time of spacecraft which generate data rates which cannot be stored over a relatively long period of time in the spacecraft itself, in which the signals sent out by the spacecraft over the course of an earth orbit are transmitted to a ground station, the data sent out by the spacecraft (2) being transmitted to at least one auxiliary satellite (2.1, 2.2,...) proceeding in front of and/or behind on the same orbital path (3), which satellites, without intermediate storing, forwards the data signals to the ground station (4) as soon as it lies within the reception range (5) of the earth station (4), and the control of the communication link between the spacecraft and the auxiliary satellite or satellites being operated from the ground station as soon as the spacecraft (2) or an auxiliary satellite (2.1,... 2.6) lies within the reception range (5) of the ground station (4).

Method for extending the communication time of a space
missile (2) with high-resolution sensors which produce

data which cannot be stored for a prolonged time in the
space missile (2) itself, with the following steps:


preparation of the space missile (2) and at least
one auxiliary satellite (2.1 ... 2.6) which moves

ahead of or lags behind the space missile (2) and
which comprises communication devices but no high-resolution

sensors which produce data which cannot
be stored for a prolonged time in the auxiliary

satellite (2.1 ... 2.6) itself, on a single common
orbit (3),
transmission of the data emitted by the space
missile (2) to at least one of the auxiliary

satellites (2.1 ... 2.6),
forwarding of the data signals without temporary
storage to the ground station (4) by the auxiliary

satellite (2.1 ... 2.6),
activation of the communication link between the
space missile (2) or the auxiliary satellite(s) (2.1

... 2.6) and the ground station (4) by the ground
station (4) as soon as the space missile (2) or an

auxiliary satellite (2.1 ... 2.6) is located within
the reception range (5) of the ground station (4),
so that the signals emitted by the space missile (2)
are transmitted to the ground station (4) in the

course of one revolution round the earth.
Method for extending the communication time of a space
missile according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the
activation or deactivation of a communication link

between space missile (2), one or more auxiliary
satellites (2.1 to 2.6) and the ground station (4) as

well as these objects between each other is controlled 
from the ground station (4) and in the process the space

missile (2) and one or more auxiliary satellites (2.1 to
2.6) are tripped individually and/or in groups or

collectively.
Method for extending the communication time of a space
missile according to claims 1 and 2, 
characterised in
that
 the space missile (2) and one or more auxiliary
satellites (2.1 to 2.6) constitute a common mission and

are fired into orbit (3) with the same carrier device or
rocket.
Satellite system for carrying out the method according
to claim 1, with:


a space missile (2) with high-resolution sensors
which produce data which cannot be stored for a

prolonged time in the space missile (2) itself; and
at least one auxiliary satellite (2.1 ... 2.6) which
is distributed on the same, single orbit (3) of the

space missile and which comprises communication
devices but no high-resolution sensors which produce

data which cannot be stored for a prolonged time in
the auxiliary satellite (2.1 ... 2.6) itself, wherein

an auxiliary satellite (2.n) is in direct contact
with at least one adjacent satellite, and the

adjacent satellite is an auxiliary satellite (2.n or
2.n+1) or the space missile (2) itself, and
a ground station (4) which comprises a device for
activation of the communication link between the

space missile (2) or the auxiliary satellite (2.1 ...
2.6) and the ground station (4) and which activates

the communication link between the space missile (2)
or the auxiliary satellite(s) (2.1 ... 2.6) and the

ground station (4) as soon as the space missile (2)
or an auxiliary satellite (2.1 ... 2.6) is located 

within the reception range (5) of the ground station
(4).
Satellite system according to claim 4, 
characterised
in that
 the auxiliary satellites (2.1 to 2.6) are
distributed equidistantly on the orbit.
Satellite system according to claims 4 and 5,

characterised in that
 the auxiliary satellites (2.1 to
2.6) have a communication device which allows

communication with the space missile (2) and/or a ground
station and/or between the auxiliary satellites (2.1 to

2.6).
Satellite system according to claims 4 to 6,

characterised in that
 the space missile (2) is equipped
with a communication device which allows communication

with one or more auxiliary satellites (2.1 to 2.6) and a
ground station (4).
