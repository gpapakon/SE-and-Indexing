<ABSTRACT>
A movable self-locking suture sleeve (50) which can 
be securely positioned on the lead body (22) of a pacing 

lead (20). The self-locking suture sleeve (50) includes 
first and second cooperative rigid elements (52,54) 

interconnected by a flexible tubing element (56). The 
tubing element (56) is constructed from a woven mesh 

designed to constrict when stretched. A resilient 
element or spring (58) is interposed between the first 

and second cooperative rigid elements (52,54), tending to 
force these elements axially apart, thereby constricting 

the suture sleeve (50) around the lead body (22).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to an 
implantable pacing lead for use with a cardiac 
pacemaker, and more specifically to a pacing lead 
having a self-locking suture sleeve for securing the 
placement of the lead at the point of venous 
insertion. A number of types of implantable leads for use 
with a cardiac pacemaker and/or defibrillator to form 
a pacing system are known in the art. Some leads 
require transvenous insertion and have a portion of 
the lead body inserted into the vein and extending 
into the heart. The remainder of the lead body which 
is not inserted into the vein extends to a point of 
attachment to an implanted pacemaker. The leads 
generally include at least one electrode which is 
implanted at a particular location within the heart. 
The implant location is particularly critical in order 
to allow optimum system performance. Thus, it is 
imperative that the electrode, and thus the lead body, 
are securely positioned in order to prevent dislodging 
of the implanted electrode after implantation. Accordingly, it is common to utilize a suture 
sleeve, located about a portion of the lead body, 
which is secured to tissue in such a manner that the 
potential for displacement of the lead body is 
minimized. Generally, the suture sleeve is positioned 
proximate the point of venous insertion. Various 
types of suture sleeves have been used in the art, 
including sleeves which are integrally formed with the  
 
lead body and thus stationary in their location, and 
suture sleeves which can be slidably positioned 
axially along at least a limited portion of the length 
of the lead body. The primary advantage of the suture 
sleeves which may be slidably positioned along the 
lead body is that the lead may be implanted in 
patients having a range of physical dimensions, and 
the suture sleeve may be positioned appropriately. Generally, the suture sleeve is positioned 
proximate the point of venous insertion and secured to 
the lead body using suture material and a suture tie. 
The suture sleeve is then secured to the surrounding 
tissue using a suture needle and suture thread. The 
suture sleeve preferably includes a slot which allows 
the attending physician to wrap the suture thread 
around and over the suture sleeve a number of times, 
each time securing the thread to the adjacent tissue. A recurring problem with the use of suture 
sleeves to secure the lead body results from the 
potential for the attending physician to overtighten 
the suture thread about the suture sleeve,
