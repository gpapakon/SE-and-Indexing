bits of a caption code, character coded data conforming 
to a format of the caption code is generated (2, 7, 8; 

22) in synchronism with a predetermined horizontal 
synchronizing signal during the blanking period of a 

video signal, and coded data is superimposed (11; 23,

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a character coding arrangement having the
function to display a character by superimposing a character code on a
video signal, a method for character display and a character signal generator,
and more particularly to a character coding arrangement, a method and a
character signal generator according to the preambles of claims 1, 7 and
11, respectively.Conventional character display circuit, method and generator are known from US-A-5,097,348.Conventional, a character display circuit for generating a character display
timing signal referenced to vertical and horizontal synchronizing signals of
a video signal and displaying a character pattern on the television screen
and VBI (video blanking interval) character coder used for closed caption
are constructed in the form of separate circuits.For example, M35040 manufactured by Mitsubishi Denki is commercially
available as the character display circuit. On the other hand, CX-7907A
manufactured by 
Sony is available as a character coding circuit
utilizing the vertical blanking period as in the case of
a character broadcast signal.A known example of technique utilizing
character broadcast is described in JP-A-2-91875.In some of VTR for business VSe, a character
display circuit and a VBI character coder are provided
separately and a caption signal is superimposed during
the blanking period of a video signal when recording is
carried out by using the VTR. Through this, when a
closed caption decoder (hereinafter simply referred to
as CCD) is built in a TV, a caption can be reproduced,
on the TV side, from a signal reproduced by the VTR.
For example, with a date/time of recording superimposed
on a video signal, the date/time of video recording can
be confirmed on the TV screen at any time and the
caption can be erased as necessary. Accordingly, in
contrast to the case where a display character is
superimposed directly on image data, the recording
picture will not be hindered.Additionally, the VBI character coder provided
for the VTR is used for superimposition of digital data
generated concomitantly with the recording picture such
as absolue addresses on the tape and editing control
marks.But, due to the fact that the character
display circuit and the VBI character coder are
constructed in the form of separate circuits, there 
arises a problem that the circuit configuration is complicated.An object of the present invention is to provide novel character coding
arrangement, a method and a character signal generator which can fulfill
