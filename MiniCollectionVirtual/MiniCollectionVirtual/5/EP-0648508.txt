Haemodialysis/haemofiltration machine comprising:

a dialysis liquid circuit (12),
means (13) for circulation of liquid in the dialysis liquid circuit
(12),
a device for servicing the dialysis liquid circuit, comprising:

a reservoir (1) for preparing at least one servicing liquid from
water and a concentrated substance, connectable to the dialysis

liquid circuit (12),
means (5, 6, 7, 8; 17, 19, 20, 26) for introducing the
concentrated substance into the reservoir (1), and
control means (15) for controlling the circulation and the
stagnation of a servicing liquid in the dialysis liquid circuit (12);

characterized in that the means for introducing a concentrated
substance into the reservoir (1) include:
at least one magazine (5, 6; 17, 26) for holding at least one tablet
(10, 21) of concentrated substance, and
closable means of communication (6, 8; 19, 20) between the
magazine (5, 6; 17, 26) and the reservoir (1) to permit the

introduction, on command, of a tablet of concentrated substance into
the reservoir (1).
Haemodialysis/haemofiltration machine according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the magazine (5, 6; 17, 26) is intended to hold a

plurality of tablets (10, 21). 
Haemodialysis/haemofiltration machine according to Claim 2,
characterized in that the control means (15) are intended to control

the successive introduction of at least two tablets (10, 21) of
different chemical nature into the reservoir (1) and the successive

preparation of the corresponding servicing liquids, tablets (10, 21) of
different chemical nature then being arranged in the magazine (5, 6;

17, 26) in an order corresponding to a predetermined succession of
servicing cycles.
Haemodialysis/haemofiltration machine according to one of
Claims 1 and 2, characterized in that the servicing device includes at

least two magazines (5, 6; 17, 26) for tablets (10, 21) of different
chemical nature.
Haemodialysis/haemofiltration machine according to Claim 4,
characterized in that the control means (15) are intended to control

the successive introduction into the reservoir (1) of at least two
tablets (10, 21) of different chemical nature and the successive

preparation of the corresponding servicing liquids.
Haemodialysis/haemofiltration machine according to one of
Claims 4 and 5, characterized in that each magazine (5, 6; 17, 26)

comprises selective access means (7, 26) in order only to authorize
the introduction, into this magazine, of tablets (10, 21) of the same

chemical nature.
Haemodialysis/haemofiltration machine according to Claim 6,
characterized in that the selective access means comprise additional 

geometric keying means (7, 26) of at least one geometric
characteristic of a tablet (10, 21) of specific chemical nature.
Haemodialysis/haemofiltration machine according to one of
Claims 1 to 7, characterized in that the servicing device comprises

means (9; 18) for detecting the chemical nature of the tablets (10,
21) stocked in the magazine (5, 6; 17, 26).
Haemodialysis/haemofiltration machine according to one of
Claims 1 to 8, characterized in that the servicing device comprises

means (3, 4) for removal of insoluble elements.
Haemodialysis/haemofiltration machine according to one of
Claims 1 to 9, characterized in that it comprises means for checking

the correspondence between a determined servicing cycle and the
chemical nature of a tablet (10, 21) introduced into the reservoir (1).
