<ABSTRACT>
Dispersion shifted optical fiber including a core and a clad 
suitable for use in wavelength 

division multiplex systems. The fiber can have an attenuation at 1550nm less 
than 

0.25dB/km, a cut off wavelength of less than 1.40µm, and a dispersion slope 
less than 0.15ps/(nm²-km). In order to avoid nonlinear effects 

(as four-wave-mixing) the working wavelength is at a point where the 
fiber has a residual dispersion of about 3ps/nm-km and not at the zero 

dispersion point.

<DESCRIPTION>
Design of optical fiber suitable for wavelength division multiplex operation.Many advanced optical fiber communication systems now being installed and to be installed are based on a remarkably sophisticated commodity - the dispersion shifted fiber (DSF). This fiber provides both for high signal capacity and low insertion loss. Years of development have culminated in a fiber with experimentally demonstrated pulse capacity of 20Gbit/sec and with attenuation in the 0.22-0.25 dB/km range.The following specification sheet is representative of state-of-the-art DSF.

Bandwidth is maximized by a fiber design resulting in a value of waveguide dispersion to shift the zero-dispersion wavelength, λ0, to 1550nm from its composition dictated value of 1310nm.A recent development takes advantage of this fiber design. To a considerable extent, new fiber optic systems depend on direct optical amplification, rather than the signal regeneration (of the repeaters) that was used in earlier systems. The erbium doped fiber amplifier (EDFA), today's most highly developed optical amplifier, operates most effectively over the same wavelength range for least insertion loss - λ = 1.55µm.Further signal capacity is to be realized by wavelength division multiplexing (WDM). Here provision is made for multiple channels - for multiple carrier wavelengths. Direct optical amplification, with its ability to amplify all channels simultaneously, has made acceptance of WDM a more realistic probability.Using already-installed non-shifted fiber, it has been demonstrated that use of four channels with channel-to-channel separation of -2nm, operating in the 1.55 µm wavelength range, capacity may be increased four-fold over single channel operation - to 4 x 2.5Gb = 10Gb.Recently installed WDM systems and those now being installed are to operate at at least
