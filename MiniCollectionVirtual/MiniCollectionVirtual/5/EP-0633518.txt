<ABSTRACT>
A clock signal circuit provides a clock signal to one 
or more portions of an electronic system selectively 

disabling the clock signal from being provided to selected 
portions of the electronic system during times when those 

portions are not being used thereby to effectively reduce 
the power consumed by the electronic system.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to clocking circuitry for 
driving logic circuits and in particular to clocking 
circuitry capable of selectively driving one or more 
portions of a logic circuit by leaving the remaining 
portions of the logic circuit quiescent. In many high performance logic systems such as 
systems employing microprocessors, one system clock is 
used to drive all portions of the system to provide clock 
synchronization. In many applications, not all portions 
of the systems or circuit therein are used at the same 
time and thus need to be clocked. By clocking all 
portions of the circuits or system, and particularly those 
portions of the circuits or system which do not need to be 
used, considerable power is wasted. For example, in 
applications such as a notebook computer using a battery, 
battery life is extended by preventing unnecessary power 
consumption. In accordance with this invention, a clocking circuit 
is provided wherein clock signals are transmitted only to 
those portions of a system or circuit which are required 
to be clocked at any given time. Further, in accordance 
with this invention, the modular clocking circuitry 
synchronizes the clocking signal provided to each portion 
of the circuit or subsystem to ensure synchronized 
operation of the logic circuitry and system free of 
glitches or other problems of a similar nature.  
 
This invention will be more fully understood in 
conjunction with the following detailed description taken 
together with the attached drawings. Figure 1 shows a block diagram of one embodiment of 
this invention. Figure 2 shows the waveforms generated using the 
circuitry of Figure 1. Figure 3 shows a system utilizing a plurality of 
modular clocks of this invention. While one embodiment of this invention will be 
described, other embodiments of this invention will be 
obvious in view of this one embodiment. Figure 1 is a schematic block diagram of one 
embodiment of this invention. In Figure 1, a flip-flop 16 
has attached to its D input terminal an input lead 12 upon 
which is transmitted an ENABLE signal. The CL input to 
flip-flop 16 is attached to input lead 15 which is also 
the output lead from an inverter 14, the input of which is 
connected to clock terminal 13. Clock signal CLK2 is 
transmitted to the clocking circuit on terminal 13. Signal SET is transmitted on lead 11 to the set input 
S of flip-flop 16. When signal SET is high, the signal on 
output lead 17 connected to the Q output terminal flip-flop 
16 is high regardless of the
