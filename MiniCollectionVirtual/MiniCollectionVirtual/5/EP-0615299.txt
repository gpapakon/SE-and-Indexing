<ABSTRACT>
A solid oxide fuel cell which has a fuel electrode (2) 
and an air electrode (3) respectively on a first surface and on a 

second surface of a solid electrolyte (1). The interface (415) between 
the solid electrolyte and the fuel electrode, and the interface 

between the solid electrolyte and the air electrode are 
roughened. An exemplary way of roughening the interfaces is 

as follows: a green sheet of solid electrolyte, a green sheet 
of fuel electrode and a green sheet of air electrode are 

laminated with the green sheet of electrolyte in the middle; 
sandpaper is put on each of the green sheet of fuel electrode 

and the green sheet of air electrode with a plastic film inbetween 
in such a manner that the rough surfaces of the 

sandpaper face the green sheets of electrode; the laminate of 
green sheets is press-fixed, whereby the rough surfaces of 

the sandpaper roughen the interfaces; and the sandpaper and 
the plastic films are removed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the preparation of solid oxide fuel
cells.In a solid oxide fuel cell, electrode reaction occurs
on an interface among a solid electrolyte, an electrode and a
gaseous phase. Accordingly, in order to improve the efficiency
of power generation of the solid oxide fuel cell, the
area of the interface among the three elements should be
increased. In the light of this point, conventionally, it
has been tried to make an electrode of fine structure by
using a material of smaller particles, but it has not brought
any satisfying results.JP-A-04190564 relates to the manufacture of a solid oxide fuel cell whereby the contact area of the solid electrolyte layer is increased by applying a slurry of the same solid electrolyte, baking and subsequently applying a slurry of the fuel and air electrodes, followed by baking.An object of the present invention is to provide methods for the preparation of
solid oxide fuel cells which have a larger effective electrode
area.In order to attain the object, a solid oxide fuel
cell has a solid electrolyte 
which has electrodes on its two major surfaces, and the
interfaces among the solid electrolyte and the electrodes are
roughened.In the structure, because of the roughened interfaces
among the solid electrolyte and the electrodes, the solid
oxide fuel cell obtains a larger effective electrode area
than a conventional one.The following is an exemplary way of roughening the
interfaces: a green sheet of solid electrolyte, a green sheet
of fuel electrode and a green sheet of air electrode are
laminated with the green sheet of solid electrolyte in the
middle; further, a sheet of sandpaper is put on each of the
green sheet of fuel electrode and the green sheet of air
electrode with a plastic film in-between in such a manner
that the rough surfaces of the sandpaper face the respective
green sheets of fuel electrode and of air electrode; and the
laminated green sheets are press-fixed. In this way, the
interfaces among the solid electrolyte and the electrodes are
roughened by the rough surfaces of the sandpaper.This and other objects and features of the present
invention will be apparent from the following description
with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:
Fig. 1 is an enlarged sectional view of a solid 
electrolyte having electrodes on both sides, the solid electrolyte
being provided in a solid oxide fuel cell which is prepared by a manufacturing process a
