<ABSTRACT>
A vehicle seat adjustment device including adjustment mechanisms (21), two-way electric motors (9-12) connected thereto, and an easily user-operated control unit (13, 14) for controlling said motors. The motors are variable-speed motors and a storage/computing unit (22) is provided for storing preprogrammed laws which define the relationships between the various parameters to be adjusted and are determined according to ergonomical standards relating to the human body. Units (24-26) for continuously sensing the value of each of the parameters, and a controller (23) using the actual sensed value of at least one of the parameters, or of a given change therein, to drive a motor which adjusts a different parameter, in such a way that the value of said different parameter matches the value set by said preprogrammed laws or changes in accordance therewith, are also provided.

A vehicle seat adjustment device comprising mechanisms 
(21) for adjusting adjustable parameters P, Q, R, ... 

(longitudinal seat position, height of seat proper, 
inclination of seat back, ...), reversible electric 

motors (9-12) associated with said mechanisms, and 
control means (13, 14) for said motors that are easily 

actuated by a user sitting on the seat, together with 
means (24-26) for detecting the values of each of the 

parameters P, Q, R, ..., at each instant, which values 
are represented by electrical magnitudes 
p
, 
q
, 
r
, ..., 
the device being characterized in that the motors (9-12) 

are of a type in which motor speed is variable as a 
function of excitation, in that the control means (23) 

for the motors are organized so as to be capable of 
applying variable excitations thereto, in that provision 

is further made for memory means (22) in which 
relationships are stored interrelating the various 

parameters that are to be adjusted and variations 
therein, which preprogrammed relationships are determined 

essentially as a function of ergonomic standards relating 
to the human body, and for computation means (22) 

organized to cause each small variation dp of each 
electrical magnitude 
p
 input therein to correspond to 
corresponding small variations dq, dr, ... in the other 

electrical magnitudes 
q
, 
r
, ... resulting from the 
preprogrammed relationships, and in that the control 

means (23) are preprogrammed so as to slave each command 
for varying one of the parameters P in a given direction 

to generation of an electrical magnitude dp which gives 
rise not only to corresponding excitation of the motor 

(9-12) associated with adjusting said parameter P, but 
also to excitation as a function of each of the 

correspondingly computed magnitudes dq, dr, ..., of each 
of the motors (9-12) for adjusting the corresponding 

parameters Q, R, ... .  
 
An adjustment devise according to claim 1, in which 
the means (24-26) for detecting at each instant the real 

value of the parameters to be adjusted P, Q, R, ... 
include position sensors mounted and organized to 

generate electrical magnitudes p
0
, q
0
, r
0
, ... 
representative of the real values at each instant of said 

parameters, characterized in that the control means (23) 
are organized so as to generate correcting magnitudes 

dq
i
, dr
i
, ... for each of the values p
0
 generated in this 
way, whenever at least one of the other values q
0
, r
0
, ... 
does not satisfy the preprogrammed relationship 

associating it with the value p
0
, which correcting 
magnitudes are equal to the differences between the ideal 

values q
i
,r
i
, ... corresponding to said value P
0
 in 
application of the above preprogrammed relationship and 

the detected real values q
0
, r
0
, ..., and so as to actuate 
accordingly the motor (9-12) associated with adjusting 

the parameter in question Q, R, ... other than the 
parameter P. 
An adjustment device according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that it includes means for temporarily 

neutralizing the set of preprogrammed control means, 
thereby making possible independent motorized adjustment 

of at least one P of the parameters to be adjusted P, Q, 
R, ..., so as to give it the value that corresponds to 

ideal adjustment for at least one of the following two 
morphological criteria: degree of flexing (A) of the legs 

of the user of the seat, and vertical position (B) of the 
user's eyes relative to the ideal sighting plane for 

driving, the computation means being organized in such a 
manner that, on subsequent use of the device after it is 

no longer being neutralized, ideal adjustment of said 
criterion is no longer capable of being significantly 

modified.
