<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to encoded chemical
libraries that contain repertoires of oligopeptide/oligonucleotide
conjugates defining a diversity of biological
structures, and methods for using the libraries.There is an increasing need to find new molecules
which can effectively modulate a wide range of
biological processes, for applications in medicine and
agriculture. A standard way for searching for novel
bioactive chemicals is to screen collections of
natural materials, such as fermentation broths or
plant extracts, or libraries of synthesized molecules
using assays which can range in complexity from simple
binding reactions to elaborate physiological
preparations. The screens often only provide leads
which then require further improvement either by
empirical methods or by chemical design. The process
it time-consuming and costly but it is unlikely to be
totally replaced by rational methods even when they
are based on detailed knowledge of the chemical
structure of the target molecules. Thus, what we
might call "irrational drug design" - the process of
selecting the right molecules from large ensembles or
repertoires - requires continual improvement both in
the generation of repertoires and in the methods of
selection.Recently there have been several developments in
using peptides or nucleotides to provide libraries of
compounds for lead discovery. The methods were
originally developed to speed up the determination of 
epitopes recognized by monoclonal antibodies. For
example, the standard serial process of stepwise
search of synthetic peptides now encompasses a variety
of highly sophisticated methods in which large arrays
of peptides are synthesized in parallel and screened
with acceptor molecules labelled with fluorescent or
other reporter groups. The sequence of any effective
peptide can be decoded from its address in the array.
See for example Geysen et al., Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci.USA,
81:3998-4002 (1984); Maeji et al., J.Immunol.Met.,
146:83-90 (1992); and Fodor et al., Science, 251: 767-775
(1991).In another approach, Lam et. al., Nature, 354:82-84
(1991) describes combinatorial libraries of
peptides that are synthesized on resin beads such that
each resin bead contains about 20 pmoles of the same
peptide. The beads are screened with labelled
acceptor molecules and those with bound acceptor are
searched for by visual inspection, physically removed,
and the peptide identified by direct sequence
analysis. In principle, this method could be used
with other chemical entities but it requires
