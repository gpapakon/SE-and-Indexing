<ABSTRACT>
An olefin resin-based article having good gas barrier 
properties is disclosed, comprising an α,β-ethylenically 

unsaturated carboxylic acid-grafted polyolefin (e.g., maleic 
anhydride-grafted polypropylene) having formed thereon an 

inorganic oxide deposite film, wherein the grafted polyolefin 
has an unsaturated carboxylic acid unit concentration of from 

0.01 to 10% by weight, with or without an anchor coat being 
provided between the grafted polyolefin and the inorganic oxide 

film. The article suffers from no reduction in gas barrier 
properties even when heat or stress is applied thereto and is 

therefore useful as a wrapping or packaging material in the 
production of pouch-packed foods and IC packages.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an olefin resin-based article
having excellent gas barrier properties which is useful in
packaging applications, such as in the protection of foods and
electronic components.The packaging of foods, electronic components, and
other oxygen sensitive entities in a film or a container which
suppresses oxygen permeation has been proposed for protecting
the packaged contents from oxidation, thereby maintaining the
quality of the contents for a prolonged period of time.For example, JP-B-53-12953 (the term "JP-B" as used
herein means an "examined published Japanese patent
application") and JP-A-4-353532 (the term "JP-A" as used herein
means an "unexamined published Japanese patent application")
disclose a transparent flexible plastic film with low
permeability to gases and moisture. This film is made of a
flexible plastic film, such as polyethylene terephthalate,
cellophane, nylon, polypropylene or polyethylene, having a
thickness of from 5 to 300 µm and a transparent thin layer of
a silicon compound represented by the general formula SixOy
(wherein x is 1 or 2; and y is 0, 1, 2 or 3) formed on at least
one side thereof in a thickness of from 100 to 3,000 Å. JP-A-63-237940 discloses a transparent film having gas
barrier properties made from the above-mentioned flexible
plastic film with a metal oxide layer on at least one side
thereof. The metal oxide layer comprises an oxide of at least
one metal selected from the group consisting of In, Sn, Zn, Zr
and Ti and is formed by sputtering. Additionally, a
transparent heat-sealable resin film is provided thereon.
Further, JP-A-3-218828 discloses a packaging material made from
a low molecular weight polypropylene film with an SiO2 deposite
layer on at least one side thereof.When a film material made of a resin which has a polar
group, such as a hydroxyl group, a carboxyl group or an amino
group, therein, for example, polyethylene terephthalate, nylon
or cellophane, is used in the above products, sufficient
adhesion to the inorganic oxide films (i.e., the SixOy and metal
oxide layers) is obtained and the gas barrier properties
provided are satisfactory, showing an oxygen permeability of
from 0.5 to 8 cc/m2·atm·day.When the above-mentioned inorganic oxides are deposited
on the surface of a resin-based article comprising a non-polar
olefin resin, such as polypropylene or polyethylene resins
having an oxygen permeability of from 1,800 to
3,000 cc/m2·atm·day, the gas barrier properties can be
increased to an oxygen permeability of from 5 to
40
