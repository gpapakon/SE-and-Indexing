<ABSTRACT>
An ostomy appliance (10) in which a collection pouch (11) is 
provided with an adhesive faceplate (12), that may be equipped 

with a convex pressure ring (24), and in which a relatively 
stiff belt-attachment ring (30) is interposed between the pouch 

and faceplate. Despite the stiffness of the belt-attachment 
ring and that of the convex pressure ring 

normally in close proximity to it, the tab connectors (34) of the 
attachment ring are readily accessible because the belt-attachment 

ring is supported in a limited "floating" 
condition by a thin, highly-flexible, annular web (31). The web 

is secured to both the pouch and faceplate along an inner 
first sealing zone (18) and joins the belt-attachment ring along 

a second concentric sealing zone (36) spaced a substantial 
distance outwardly from the first zone.

<DESCRIPTION>
One-piece ostomy appliances are often provided with 
belt-attachment rings so that a wearer may connect a 
support belt to the appliance to provide additional 
security in holding it in place. The term "one-piece" as 
commonly used in this field means a unitary appliance in 
which the pouch and adhesive faceplate are permanently 
joined together, in contrast to a two-piece appliance in 
which a pouch and faceplate are detachably connected by a 
pair of mechanical (or adhesive) coupling rings. One-piece 
appliances equipped with such belt-attachment rings are 
disclosed, for example, in co-owned U.S. patents 3,523,534, 
3,822,704 and 4,213,458. Belt-attachment rings, where they 
are provided, are usually heat sealed or otherwise secured 
to the pouches, although co-owned U.S. patent 4,710,182 
discloses a construction in which a separate belt-attachment 
ring may be added by the patient by first 
collapsing the pouch and inserting it through the opening 
of the ring until the ring is in the position depicted in 
Figure 4 of that reference. It is also known to provide ostomy appliances with 
relatively rigid convex pressure rings for the purpose of 
increasing stomal protrusion when the appliance is worn, 
thereby aiding in the discharge of effluent directly into 
the pouch and also prolonging the effectiveness of the 
adhesive seal between the faceplate and peristomal skin 
surfaces. Reference may be had to U.S. patents 4,834,731 
and 4,973,323 for examples of appliances having such 
pressure rings.  
 Where an appliance is equipped with both a convex 
pressure ring and a belt-attachment ring, the close 
proximity of the two rings and their stiffness may make it 
difficult for a wearer to connect or disconnect a belt from 
the connecting loops or tabs of the belt-attachment ring. 
Even where a convex pressure ring is absent, it may be 
difficult for a wearer to fit his/her fingers between the 
connecting tabs of the belt-attachment ring and the 
adhesive faceplate because of the stiffness of the ring and 
the close proximity of the annular area of connection 
between the ring and the faceplate on which it is mounted. 
Also, it has been found that the customary stiffness of a 
belt-attachment ring may have the undesirable effect of 
interfering with the flexibility of those portions of an 
adhesive faceplate that should be free to conform to the 
anatomical contour of peristomal body surfaces and to 
changes in such contour as a patient moves about. One aspect of this invention therefore lies in 
providing

<CLAIMS>
An ostomy appliance comprising a collection pouch (11) 
formed of thermoplastic film and having a wall (11a) provided 

with a stoma opening (17); a flexible faceplate (12) having 
pouchside and bodyside surfaces and being provided with 

pressure-sensitive adhesive means (19) along said bodyside 
surface for adhesive attachment of said appliance to a wearer; 

said faceplate (12) having an opening (23) aligned with said 
pouch opening (17) and being secured to said pouch wall (11a) 

about said pouch opening; and belt-attachment means (30) 
interposed between said faceplate (12) and pouch (11) and 

comprising (a) a thin, highly-flexible annular web (31) having 
an opening (35) defined by an inner edge portion and (b) a 

relatively stiff belt-attachment ring (32) secured to an outer 
edge portion of said web; said attachment ring (32) being 

provided with means (34) for detachably connecting said ring to 
a body-encircling support belt; whereby, said thin, flexible web 

(31) supports said belt-attachment ring (32) for limited 
independent movement towards and away from said faceplate and 

pouch to facilitate connection and disconnection of said ring 
and belt by a user when said appliance is worn while preventing 

rotation of said belt-attachment ring (32) with respect to said 
pouch and faceplate. 
The appliance of Claim 1 in which said web (31) is 
thermoplastic and has its inner edge portion interposed between 

and heat sealed to both said pouch wall (11a) and said faceplate 
(12) along an annular first heat seal zone (18).  

 
The appliance of Claim 2 in which said belt-attachment 
ring (32) has generally planar bodyside and pouchside faces with 

one of said faces being heat sealed to said outer edge portion 
of said web (31) in a second heat seal zone (36) spaced 

substantially outwardly from said first heat seal zone (18). 
The appliance of Claim 2 in which said faceplate (12) 
includes inner and outer ring elements (22,19); said inner ring 

element (22) being formed of flexible non-porous thermoplastic 
material and said outer ring element (19) being formed of 

moisture vapor permeable material. 
The appliance of Claim 2 in which said faceplate also 
includes a skin barrier ring (26) having a thermoplastic film 

backing (27); said thermoplastic film backing being heat sealed 
to said web (31) and said pouch wall (11a) along said first heat 

seal zone (18). 
The appliance of Claim 1 in which said faceplate 
includes a relatively rigid thermoplastic pressure ring (24) 

having a convex surface (24a) facing away from said pouch and 
having a generally planar surface (24b) facing towards said web 

(31) and pouch wall (11a); said pressure ring (24) having an 
opening coaxial with the pouch's stoma opening (17; said 

pressure ring (24) also being sealed to said web (31) and pouch 
(11) along said first heat seal zone (18). 
The appliance of Claim 6 in which said pressure ring 
(24) has an outside diameter greater than the inside diameter of 

said belt-attachment ring (30).  
 
The appliance of Claim 3 in which said second heat seal 
zone (36) is located along one of said planar faces of said 

belt-attachment ring (30). 
The appliance of Claim 8 in which said second heat seal 
zone (36) is spaced from the inner periphery of said 

belt-attachment ring (30). 
The appliance of Claim 9 in which said second heat seal 
zone (36) is located along said bodyside face of said 

belt-attachment ring (30) adjacent the outer periphery thereof.
