<ABSTRACT>
In a radio communications system having at least one base station, the base station including a plurality of transceivers, a control method and apparatus includes the steps of comparing the number of transceivers in a call state to a first predefined number. If the number of call state transceivers is greater than the first predefined number, then all of the idle transceivers except at least one are switched off. If the number of call state transceivers is less than the first predefined number, then all excess idle transceivers are switched off. Also, after switching off the first subset of the plurality of transceivers, a second subset may be switched off after waiting a predetermined time period. The number of operational transceivers in the second subset is less than in the first subset. To further reduce the power consumption of the base station, a first group of radio communications system subscribers is designated as a high priority group, and a second group of subscribers is designated as a low priority group. The system is designed to grant service to the high priority group, while denying it to the low priority group. The control methods and apparatus are useful, for example, for reducing power consumption and/or traffic handling capacity of a base station.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to control of a radio
communications system base station, and more particularly
to a control method which reduces power consumption and
traffic handling capacity in a radio communications
system base station without harshly affecting ongoing
calls within the cell served by the base station.In a radio communications system having at least one
base station (BS), such as in a cellular telephone
system, the base station provides service to mobile units
located within a predefined geographical area. Such base
stations are expected to operate during power failures
that generally affect the location of the base station.
Consequently, there is a need to provide an alternative
("backup") source of power to a base station which will
be utilized when the usual source of base station power
has failed. Suitable backup sources of power may be
batteries or in some circumstances, diesel-powered
electric generators.A base station site having, for example, 72
transceivers (typically, a base station site has between
10 and 100 transceivers), each transmitting 50 Watts (W)
of power with a power efficiency of 25% requires
(50/0.25)*72 = 14400 W of power to operate. Normally, a
24 volt system is used for radio base stations, so an
exemplary electric current requirement for a base station
during times of heavy loads would be 14400/24 = 600 amp.
Providing this amount of power during a failure of the
main power supply requires a backup power supply to
consist of many costly batteries or diesel-powered
electric generators. Furthermore, accommodating the
physical bulk of these backup power supplies may require 
that the base station plant floor be reinforced, and that the size of the base station
plant be increased. Consequently, battery and plant costs commonly constitute the
major investments for base station operators, and can even make it impossible to
build some base station sites.Thus, there is a need to provide a way for a base station to continue to
operate during a power outage while at the same time reducing the cost and size of
the backup power supply.There are also circumstances other than failure of the main power supply,
during which it would be advantageous to reduce the power consumption of the
base station. For example, the overheating of equipment, or the occurrence of a
fire could warrant reducing the base station power consumption. Similarly, there
are circumstances when it is desirable to reduce the traffic handling capacity of the
base station. During such transitions to reduced
