<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel phosphonate-nucleotide
ester derivatives or pharmaceutically acceptable salts
thereof. More particularly, it relates to novel
phosphonate-nucleotide ester derivatives or
pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof which can be
orally administered as antiviral agents.Infectious viral diseases have been recognized as
medically important problems. For treatment of such
diseases, drugs having antiviral activity but no inhibitory
activity on growth of normal cell lines have been
developed. For example, 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxy)ethyladenine
(PMEA), 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxy)ethyl-2,6-diaminopurine
(PMDAP) etc. have
been reported to be effective on herpes simplex viruses
type-I and II (HSV-1 and HSV-2), human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) (Yokota et al., Antimicrob.
Agents Chemother., 35, 394 (1991); Votruba et al., Mol.
Pharmacol., 32, 524 (1987)].The problems of these nucleotides and ionic
organophosphate esters are their deficiency of oral
absorptivity [see, De Clercq et al., Antimicrob. Agents
Chemother., 33, 185 (1989)]. Therefore, these compounds
should be parenterally administered, for example, by 
intravenous or intramuscular injection, to attain
sufficient blood concentration to elicit their effect.However, it is difficult to apply treatment
utilizing parenteral administration unless the subject is
in a hospital. Accordingly, it is not a preferred method
to treat subjects suffering from altricious diseases such
as AIDS and HBV diseases. Accordingly, there required
development of drugs which have antiviral activity and can
be orally administered. Up to date, no drugs have
been put into practical use.EP-A-0 481214 relates to orally active prodrugs of phosphonate nucleotide analogs
and specifically discloses 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxy)ethyladenine, di(pivaloyloxymethylester).
WO 92/09611 also relates to phosophonate nucleotide ester derivatives
and specifically discloses some di(acyloxyethoxy)phosphorylmethoxy adenine
derivatives.The present inventors have studied intensively to
solve the above problems. As a result, we have found
that the object can be attained using a certain kind of
phosphonatenucleotide esters, and have attained the present
invention.That is, the point of the present invention
resides in phosphonatenucleotide ester derivatives of the
following general formula (I):
 
(wherein ring A represents

(wherein R1 and R2 independently represent hydrogen,
halogen, hydroxyl, mercapto, C6-C10 arylthio or amino), R3
represents C1-C4 alkyl,
