<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an eductor according to the preamble of claim 1. An eductor of this kind entrains an air flow serving 
the purpose of cooling a compartment in which is mounted 
a gas turbine engine. In addition to their traditional propulsion 
functions, gas turbine engines are used as auxiliary power 
units, (APUs), aboard many types of aircraft, ground 
vehicles, and stationary installations to provide 
continuous shaft and/or pneumatic power. The shaft power 
is used to drive electric generators, hydraulic pumps, or 
mother equipment requiring constant speed operation. The 
pneumatic power is used for main engine starting, cabin 
air-conditioning and pressurization, de-icing, air turbine 
motors, or other components requiring compressed air. When 
used aboard an aircraft, for example, the APU is typically 
mounted in a compartment located within the tail cone of 
the aircraft. Historically, APU's have only been operated when 
the aircraft was on the ground. However, recent 
developments in aircraft design have witnessed the advent 
of twin engine aircraft capable of long distant, 
transoceanic flights. Examples of such aircraft are the 
Boeing 757, 767 and 777, currently under development, as 
well as the Airbus A300, A310, and A320. A disadvantage to 
the twin engine design is that when a main engine  
 
experiences an inflight shutdown the enormous burden of 
supplying the aircraft with power falls on the sole, 
remaining engine. Early on in the development of these 
aircraft, it was recognized that they would need an 
additional source of power while inflight. To meet this 
need it was proposed to start and operate the APU inflight 
at high altitudes. During the operation of the APU, heat is rejected 
into the compartment from numerous sources including the 
engine skin, exhaust gases, and tailpipe, as well as the 
engine oil cooler, generator, and other compartment 
accessories. To prevent the temperature in the compartment 
from reaching unacceptable levels, a ventilating or cooling 
airflow must be provided through the compartment. To remove this heat an axial, vane type fan, driven 
off the APU gearbox, is usually provided to pump cooling 
air past the the oil cooler as well through the 
compartment. However, because of their multiplicity of 
high speed, rotating parts, these fans are susceptible to 
mechanical failures, which when they occur require that the 
aircraft be removed from operation. Further, these fans 
sometimes leak oil into the cooling flow which then covers 
the oil

An eductor comprising an annular mixer nozzle 
(70, 72) receiving a flow of high velocity gas, and 

mounted within a housing (80) defining a first annular 
plenum (86) circumscribing said mixer nozzle (70, 72), 

said plenum (86) having an inlet (90) for receiving 
venting air from the environment (12) surrounding said 

eductor (60), said housing (80) also defining a second 
nozzle (81) receiving said venting air from said plenum 

(86), said second nozzle (81) also circumscribing said 
mixer nozzle (72), said venting air having a velocity 

substantially less than said gas, and a mixing duct (54) 
downstream of said mixer nozzle (70, 72) and said second 

nozzle (81) for receiving and mixing their respective 
discharge flows, characterized by further comprising 

means (68, 88, 94) for injecting a stream of high 
pressure gas into said mixing duct (54) downstream of 

said mixer nozzle (70, 72) and said second nozzle (81). 
The eductor of claim 1 further including an oil 
cooler (62) transversely mounted across said inlet (90) 

to said plenum (86)
.
The eductor of claim 1 wherein said injecting 
means (68, 88, 94) includes a housing (82, 83) defining 

a second annular plenum (88) downstream of said first 
annular plenum (86) and circumscribing said mixing duct 

(54), said second plenum (88) having an inlet (93) for 
receiving a flow of high velocity air, said housing (82, 

83) also including a ring wall (94) disposed between 
said second plenum (88) and said mixing duct (54), said 

ring wall (94) having a plurality of holes (98) for 
passing said high velocity air from said second plenum 

(88) into said mixing duct (54).  
 
The eductor of claim 3 wherein said holes (98) 
are circumferentially spaced, each of said holes (98) 

opening into a scoop (96) extending radially inward from 
the inner surface of said ring wall (94), said scoop 

(96) turning the flow of said high velocity air so that 
when said air enters said mixing duct (54) it is flowing 

in substantially the same direction as the flow of mixed 
gas and air in the mixing duct (54). 
The eductor of claim 1 wherein said housing (80) 
defines a second annular plenum (88) downstream of said 

first annular plenum (86) and circumscribing said mixing 
duct (54), said second plenum having an inlet (93) for 

receiving a flow of high velocity air, said housing (80) 
including a first bellmouth shaped wall (84) and a 

second bellmouth shaped wall (94a) circumscribing a 
portion of said first bellmouth shaped wall (84) to 

define an annular passage (93a) therebetween, said 
bellmouth shaped walls (84, 94a) being disposed between 

said second plenum (88) and said mixing duct (54) so 
that said high velocity air in said second plenum (88) 

flows through said annular passage (93a) into said 
mixing duct (54).
