<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates
to a fluidized bed reactor
arrangement for forming a metal carbide coating on a graphite or carbon containing substrate.Certain metal carbides display exceptional hardness and thermochemical stability. In
particular the carbides of hafnium, niabium, tantalum, titanium and zirconium are among the most
refractory materials known and are generally stable in severe chemical environments. Coatings of
metal carbides have thus found application in the aerospace, nuclear and metallurgical industries. For
example, high temperature nuclear reactors use nuclear fuel particles of uranium or oxides of nuclear
fuel material which are encased in a protective coating usually of pyrolytic carbon with an outer
metal carbide layer. The protective coating has the function of retaining the fuel and fission products
during nuclear burn up within the individual particles themselves. The coating must endure the fuel
element production and undergo no damage during nuclear burn up. Failure of the coating results in
the release of the fission products.It is known to decompose a hydrocarbon gas such as methane to form a coating of pyrolytic
carbon on a substrate in a fluidized bed furnace. It is also known to use standard chemical vapor
deposition in combination with a fluidized bed reactor to form a metal coating on particles
suspended in the fluidized bed. In this regard fluidized bed systems have been widely used in many
industrial applications to form a coating of metal on a substrate. The metal coating formed by the
decomposition of a gas forms a mechanical bond at the surface of the substrate which is acceptable 
for most applications but not in situations where the coating is subjected to extreme environmental
conditions particularly in a nuclear reactor. A process for coating solid particles, for use as a nuclear
fuel of, e.g., uranium oxide dispersed in carbon or graphite, with refractory metals is taught
in U.S. Patent No. 3,442,690. This process is carried out in a vertical tube furnace operated as a
fluidized bed reactor. In U.S. Patent No. 3,369,920, a process is disclosed for applying pyrolytic
coatings to a filament cloth of carbon or graphite which involves the decomposition of a metal halide
and a pyrolytic metal under conditions at less than atmospheric pressure.High temperature coating and apparatus has been developed in accordance with the present
invention containing fluid bed reactor technology with chemical vapor deposition techniques to
produce a chemically bonded coating of a metal
