<ABSTRACT>
The reaction of a dialkyl magnesium compound with a halogenating agent, a titanium compound and an electron-donor compound gives a catalyst component which, together with an organoaluminium compound in the polymerisation and copolymerisation of ethylene, gives ultrahigh-molecular-weight ethylene homopolymers and copolymers having a mean particle diameter of from 50 to 200  mu m and a viscosity number of greater than 2000 cm
<
3
>
/g. The mean particle diameter can be modified by means of the catalyst particle diameter and by means of the catalyst productivity.
