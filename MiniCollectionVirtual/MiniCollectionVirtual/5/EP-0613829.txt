<ABSTRACT>
An can end tray (1) for storing a plurality of arrays 
of can ends (w) while the can ends are being conveyed has 

a substantially rectangular upstanding side wall (2) having a 
height at least equal to the diameter of the can ends, and 

a plurality of can end supports (3) on a bottom of said 
tray for supporting arrays of can ends thereon, said can 

end supports having a plurality of partitions (8) for holding 
the arrays of can ends spaced from each other when the arrays 

of can ends are placed on said can end supports. A 
plurality of spacers(9) are disposed on said side wall in longitudinal 

alignment with said can end supports for spacing 
said side wall and ends of the arrays of can ends from each 

other when the arrays of can ends are placed on said can 
end supports. When the arrays of can ends are placed on 

said can end supports, the spacers extend across the can 
ends at the ends of the array
s of can ends, defining gaps (x) 
between said side wall and the can ends at the ends of the 

arrays of can ends.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tray 
according to the preamble of claim 1 for 
holding a plurality of can ends while they are being conveyed. It has heretofore been known to convey a plurality 
of arrays of stacked can ends stored in a storage box. Japanese laid-open utility model publication No. 
3-15341 discloses such a storage box for storing can ends. 
The disclosed storage box is substantially in the shape of 
a rectangular parallelepiped that comprises a rectangular 
bottom plate and upstanding wall plates extending from peripheral 
edges of the bottom plate. Can ends are manually 
stored into the storage box by the worker. Specifically, 
horizontal arrays of can ends are successively placed on 
the bottom plate of the storage box. After the bottom 
plate is covered with one layer of can end arrays, another 
layer of horizontal arrays of can ends is piled up on the 
lower layer. Therefore, the storage box holds vertically 
successive layers of horizontal arrays of can ends. Horizontal arrays of can ends may be efficiently 
placed into and removed from the storage box by a robot 
having a gripper. The gripper grips an array of can ends 
and takes it into and out of the storage box.  
 When the storage box stores can ends, it holds them 
in vertically successive layers of horizontal arrays, as 
described above. Therefore, adjacent can end arrays are 
closely held against each other in the storage box. The 
can end arrays that are closely packed in the storage 
box prevent the gripper from being inserted between the 
can end arrays. Consequently, it would be difficult for 
the robot to take can ends automatically into and out of 
the storage box. The opposite can ends of each of the can end arrays 
stored in the storage box are held against the 
respective opposite wall plates thereof. When one of 
the can end arrays is removed from the storage box, a 
space is created laterally of those can end arrays which 
are positioned adjacent to the removed can end array. 
The remaining can end arrays tend to flex convexly 
toward the space and hence to be deformed out of a 
desired shape. Since the can end arrays are held in contact in the 
storage box, the contacting can end arrays are liable to 
damage each other when vibrated during shipment. EP-A-0342825 (corresponding to the preamble of claim 1) 
and EP-A-0141938 both disclose a can 
end tray for storing a plurality of arrays of can ends 
while the can ends are being conveyed, comprising a 
substantially rectangular upstanding side wall having a 
heig

<CLAIMS>
A can end tray (1) for storing a plurality of arrays 
of can ends (w) while the can ends (w) are being 

conveyed, comprising: 

a substantially rectangular upstanding side wall (2) 
having a height at least equal to the diameter of the can 

ends; 
a plurality of can end supports (3) on a bottom of 
said tray (1) for supporting arrays of can ends (w) 

thereon, said can end supports (3) having a plurality of 
partitions (8) for holding the arrays of can ends (w) 

spaced from each other when the arrays of can ends (w) 
are placed on said can end supports (3); and 
a plurality of spacers (9) disposed on said side 
wall (2) in longitudinal alignment with said can end 

supports (3) for spacing said side wall (2) and ends of 
the arrays of can ends (w) from each other when the 

arrays of can ends (w) are placed on said can end 
supports (3), said spacers (9) being arranged such that 

when the arrays of can ends (w) are placed on said can 
end supports (3), the spacers (9) extend across the can 

ends (w) at the ends of the arrays of can ends, defining 
gaps between said side wall (2) and the can ends (w) at 

the ends of the arrays of can ends, 
 
   characterised in that said side wall (2) is substantially in 

the cross-sectional shape of an inverted U, and said side wall (2) has a 
downwardly projecting beaded edge (12) formed at the base 

of the inner side wall portion and a recess (13) defined  
 

in an upper portion in vertical alignment with said beaded 
edge (12), said beaded edge (12) and said recess (13) 

extending fully along said side wall (2). 
A can end tray according to claim 1, wherein each of 
said spacers (9) is substantially rectangular in shape 

for defining gaps (x) between said side wall (2) and 
opposite side portions of one of the can ends (w) at the 

ends of the arrays of can ends. 
A can end tray according to claim 1, wherein each of 
said spacers (9) comprises a first abutting portion (10) 

for vertically abutting against the can end (w) at one of 
the ends of the arrays of can ends, defining gaps (x) 

between said side wall (2) and opposite side portions of 
the can end (w), when the arrays of can ends are placed 

on said can end supports (3), and a second abutting 
portion (11) for horizontally abutting against the can 

end (w) at one of the ends of the arrays of can ends when 
the arrays of can ends (w) are placed on said can end 

supports (3). 
A can end tray according to claim 3, wherein said 
first (10) and second (11) abutting portions of each of 

said spacers (9) are jointly of a substantially 
triangular shape.  

 
A can end tray according to claim 3, wherein said 
first (10) and second (11) abutting portions of each of 

said spacers (9) are jointly of a substantially inverted 
T shape. 
A can end tray according to claim 1, wherein each of 
said spacers (9) has a central abutting portion for 

abutting against a central portion of the can end (w) at 
one end of each of the arrays of can ends, defining gaps 

(x) between the side wall (2) and opposite portions of 
said can end (w). 
A can end tray according to any preceding claim, and 
a gripper (A) having a pair of gripper arms (a) movable 

toward and away from each other for gripping the arrays 
of can ends, one at a time, in the longitudinal direction 

thereof, and a pair of engaging plates (b) joined to each 
end of said gripper arms (a) for engaging one end of each 

of the arrays of can ends, wherein
 
   said partitions (8) define gaps therebetween for 

allowing the gripper arms (a) as they move away from each 
other to be inserted therein between adjacent arrays of 

can ends; and
 
   said spacers (9) define gaps (x) between said side 

wall (2) and the can ends at the ends of the arrays of 
can ends supported on said can end supports (3), for 

allowing the engaging plates (6) to be inserted therein.
