<ABSTRACT>
An automatic cartridge feeder includes a magazine slot that 
receives a cartridge magazine and includes a priority slot that directly 

receives single cartridges. The automatic cartridge feeder can receive a 
cartridge through the priority slot regardless of the condition of the 

cartridge magazine. In an automatic mode, cartridges are taken 
sequentially from the magazine and are processed. Any cartridge placed 

in the priority slot by an operator will be processed immediately after 
any in-progress cartridge processing. In an accumulate mode, cartridges 

are received through the priority slot for processing and are returned in 
sequence to an empty cartridge magazine.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to automatic data cartridge 
feeders for use with drive units and, more particularly, to automatic 
cartridge feeders that receive cartridges and transport them to and from 
a drive unit for processing. Computer system tape drive units can be configured to receive tape 
cartridges, such as IBM Corporation 3480 and 3490E cartridges. The 
cartridges contain a length of magnetic tape upon which data can be 
written and read. Many tape drive units can mate with an automatic 
cartridge feeder that accepts a tape cartridge and transports it to the 
drive unit tape transport mechanism and read/write heads. Automatic 
cartridge feeders are available in configurations that accept cartridges 
one at a time through a single feed slot and configurations that mate 
with removable cartridge magazines, containing a plurality of tape 
cartridges, from which cartridges are accepted one at a time. Automatic cartridge feeders having a feed slot for single 
cartridges permit an operator to sequentially insert tape cartridges that 
are automatically transported to the drive unit. In this way, the 
operator has complete control over the next cartridge to be processed and 
can interrupt a planned sequence of cartridges at any time to insert a 
high priority cartridge or to otherwise process a cartridge out of turn. 
An automatic cartridge feeder with only a single feed slot can be very 
inefficient, however, because an operator is occupied substantially the 
entire time the drive unit is being used. Moreover, loose cartridges can 
be lost, mishandled, or placed out of sequence. Automatic cartridge feeders that accept removable cartridge 
magazines can greatly increase operating efficiency. A cartridge 
magazine typically includes a plurality of cartridge shelves, each of 
which receives a cartridge, and is coupled to the cartridge feeder such 
that the cartridge feeder can transport cartridges from the magazine to 
the drive unit in the sequence they are stored in the magazine or in a 
sequence selected by the drive unit. Typical magazines have a capacity 
of seven to twelve cartridges. The cartridge magazine frees an operator 
from being occupied with the feeder and drive unit and also reduces the 
number of times an operator must manually intervene to provide fresh 
cartridges. Unfortunately, once a cartridge magazine is mounted to a  
 
cartridge feeder, there is no quick and efficient way to process a 
particular priority cartridge that is not already in the magazine.

transport mechanism is adapted to return a cartridge from the drive unit 

to the shelf or priority slot location from which it was retrieved. 
A cartridge feeder system as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, wherein 
the transport mechanism is adapted to return a cartridge received from 

the priority slot to the next available, unoccupied shelf of the 
cartridge magazine. 
A cartridge feeder system as claimed in any preceding claim, 
wherein the transport mechanism includes a cartridge-receiving tray that 

can move from an initial position adjacent the priority slot or adjacent 
the removable cartridge magazine for receiving a cartridge to a position 

adjacent the drive unit and back again for returning the cartridge. 
A cartridge feeder system as claimed in any preceding claim, 
wherein the feeder transport mechanism includes a sensor assembly that 

indicates if a cartridge is present in the priority slot or in a shelf of 
the cartridge magazine. 
A cartridge feeder system as claimed in claim 5, wherein the feeder 
transport sensor assembly is adapted to distinguish between processed and 

not processed cartridges that are either on a shelf of the cartridge 
magazine or in the priority slot. 
A cartridge feeder system as claimed in claim 5 or claim 6, wherein

priority slot to a position adjacent any one of the cartridge magazine 
shelves and the system further includes a controller that controls 

movement of the transport mechanism such that, if the transport mechanism 
tray has received a cartridge from a magazine shelf and upon returning 

the tray to the magazine the sensor assembly indicates that the shelf is 
occupied by a cartridge, then the controller moves the transport 

mechanism to the priority slot. 
A cartridge feeder system as claimed in claim 7, wherein the 
controller indicates an attention condition if the sensor assembly 

indicates the priority slot also is occupied with a cartridge after the 
transport mechanism was moved from the original cartridge magazine shelf 

to the priority slot.

the controller comprises a logic card that is coupled to a central 

processor unit of the drive unit. 
A cartridge feeder system as claimed in any preceding claim, 
wherein the cartridge feeder further comprises a plurality of cartridge 

status indicators that indicate the status of the priority slot and each 
shelf of the cartridge magazine. 
A cartridge feeder system as claimed in claim 10, wherein the 
status indicator of the priority slot indicates an attention condition if 

the sensor mechanism indicates the priority slot is occupied with a 
cartridge when the feeder transport assembly unsuccessfully attempts to 

return the processed cartridge to the cartridge magazine. 
A cartridge feeder system as claimed in any preceding claim, 
wherein the cartridge feeder is operable in an automatic mode in which 

all shelves of the cartridge magazine can be loaded with a cartridge and 
a central processor of the drive unit can sequentially process the

wherein the cartridge feeder is operable in an accumulate mode in which 

cartridges are received from the priority slot, processed by the drive 
unit, and returned to the next available empty shelf in the cartridge 

magazine. 
A cartridge feeder system as claimed in any preceding claim, 
operable in an automatic mode in which the cartridge feeder system 

receives cartridges from the magazine and a unit central processor of the 
drive unit automatically selects the next cartridge in sequence, and 

further can receive an interrupt request for a specific cartridge from a 
host computer and will automatically process a cartridge placed in the 

priority slot as the next cartridge to be processed. 
A cartridge feeder system as claimed in any preceding claim, 
wherein the cartridge is operable in a system mode in which the drive 

unit central processor controls the receiving, processing, and return of 
cartridges from the cartridge magazine. 
A cartridge processing system for use with a host processor, the 
cartridge processing system comprising: 

   a drive processor that communicates with the host processor and 
receives cartridges for processing;

ode such that, in the accumulate mode, the cartridge 
feeder retrieves a cartridge placed in the priority slot, transports the 

cartridge to the processor and returns it to the next unoccupied magazine 
 

slot and, in the automatic mode, the cartridge feeder retrieves a 
cartridge, transports the cartridge to the processor, and returns the 

cartridge to the slot or magazine shelf from which it was retrieved.
