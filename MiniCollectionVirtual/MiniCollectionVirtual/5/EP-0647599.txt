<ABSTRACT>
Automatic blank-mold sooting device in the glass making 
industry, adapted to deposit a lubricating/detaching layer on 

the internal walls of said mold, said deposit being 
substantially made of carbon black obtained from acetylene 

cracking process. Plugging means (6, 7, 8, 9) are provided to 
disengage the bottom (10) of said blank mold (1) during a blank 

mold sooting process, whereby said lubricating/detaching layer 
can be deposited substantially in a uniform way on all portions 

of said blank mold internal walls, allowing that a glass gob (3) 
can freely flow along said internal walls.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for manufacturing
glass containers, comprising:
a blank mold,
-- the bottom of said mold being provided with plugging means
having a plunger guided within a sleeve and a collar,
within which a ring is fitted,
for the
insertion of said sleeve,a funnel and a
baffle both being adapted to engage the upper opening of the
mold, whereby the baffle may also be engaged with the upper
opening of the funnel,and a sooting device adapted to deposit on the internal walls
of the mold a lubricating and detaching layer substantially made
of carbon black.Such a device is known from US-A-3 141 752. Sooting of the mold
is effected by a lubricant such as oil or the like that is
sprayed through bores of the upper funnel when the mold bottom
is closed. This means that it is impossible to cover the whole
surface of the inner walls of the mold and the whole outer
surface of the plunger and of the sleeve surfaces. Further,
during the sooting phase the collar remains in its position at
the bottom of the mold and is used to transfer the parison to a
blow mold before the next sooting phase that takes place after
each molding process. This is necessary because a lubricant is
used, such as oil or the like.In EP-A-443 794 an automatic blank mold sooting device is
described that is adapted to deposit on the internal walls of
the mold a lubricating and detaching layer subtantially made of
carbon black. The bottom of said mold is provided with plugging 
means having a plunger guided within a sleeve and adapted to
disengage the bottom during a blank mold sooting phase. However,
during the sooting process a neck ring and a guide ring remain
in their closing position at the bottom of the blank-mold; only
the plunger is moved downwards when a lubricating carbon layer
is injected from the nozzle.EP-A 393 554 shows the lower part of a burner for spraying a
lubricating and detaching layer into a mold, using an acetylene
flow that is ignited by means of an arc.Further devices are well known in the art in which a pilot flame
is provided which is able to ignite the acetylene flow in
correspondence of a well defined moment of an operation cycle,
not in correspondence of every operation cycle, but just once
every n cycles, according to the specifications of glassware to
be obtained. In such a way, acetylene black process is able to
coat the internal walls of the blank mold. But this solution has
several drawbacks. Indeed:
heat produced by the pilot flame heats the environment around
the blank mold, whereby

<CLAIMS>
Device for manufacturing glass containers, comprising:

a blank mold (1),

-- the bottom (10) of said mold (1) being provided with plugging
means having a plunger (8; 14) guided within a sleeve (9) and a

collar (6), within which a ring (7) is fitted, for the insertion
of said sleeve (9),
a funnel (2) and
a baffle (4) both being adapted to engage the upper opening of

the mold (1), whereby the baffle (4) is also engageable with the
upper opening of the funnel (2),
and a sooting device adapted to deposit on the internal walls
of the mold (1) a lubricating and detaching layer substantially

made of carbon black,

characterised in that
said sooting device comprises an acetylene feeding pipe (24)
and electrical ignition sparking means (21, 22, 23), both being

adapted to be positioned above the funnel (2), during one active
cycle every n operating cycles, by an operation cycle timing

means (20),
said operation cycle timing means (20) controlling also the
movement of the plugging means such that, during the sooting

phase,

-- the plunger (8; 14) is lowered with respect to the sleeve (9)
so as to disengage from the sleeve (9) and to allow acetylene

flame product to flow through the sleeve (9) and around the
plunger (8),
-- the collar (6) is disengaged from the sleeve (9) and from the
bottom (10) of the mold (1).
Device according to claim 1, wherein said sparking means (21,
22, 23) are adapted to control a piezoelectric ignition of

electrodes (22) which form a gap not interfering with said
acetylene flow.
Device according to claim 2, wherein said electrical sparking
means (21, 22, 23) are adapted to control a voltaic arc or an

electric resistance.
Device according to any of the preceding claims, wherein the
sooting phase takes place during the transfer, by means of an

inverting element (12), of the collar (6) together with a preformed

parison (15) from said blank mold (1) to a blow mold (11).
Device according to any of the preceding claims, wherein said
operation cycle timing means (20) controls also a pressure

modulating means in said acetylene feeding pipe (24) so as to
reduce flow pressure at the beginning of the acetylene flow in

every active sooting cycle and to feed said pipe (24) with
substantially full pressure when the electrodes (22) have been

ignited.
Device according to any of the preceding claims, wherein the
parison (15) is formed by means of a counter-blow air (10a) fed

through the open bottom (10) when said plunger (8) has been
moved downwards in said sleeve (9).
