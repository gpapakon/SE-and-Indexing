<ABSTRACT>
The apparatus for sterilising feeding bottles is distinguished by the fact that the container (2) has, at its bottom, one or more ribs (2.1) supporting the grille, the said grille being monobloc and being designed with a plurality of apertures (3.1) permitting the diffusion of steam, and a plurality of means (5) configured and designed to ensure that each feeding bottle is gripped by its neck (B1) and supported by its body, each means (5) being designed with a profiled seat (5.1) presenting an inclined plane (5.2) and a transverse inward curving (5.8) partially enveloping the body of the feeding bottle, this seat being continued in its bottom part by a collar structure (5.3) which is able to surround the neck of the feeding bottle, the said structure (5.3) having an opening (5.5) through which the neck of the feeding bottle passes perpendicular to the plane of the seat.

An appliance for holding baby milk bottles
for the purpose of their sterilisation of a type

comprising a bottom container (2) capable of
enclosing a volume of water, the aforementioned

container (2) receiving at a set height an integrally
formed grid (3) provided with a plurality of cut-outs

(3.1) equipped with means (5) allowing the engagement
and positioning of baby milk bottles by their neck in

an inclined position with respect to vertical, the
aforementioned container receiving a bell cover (4),

the appliance being capable of placement in a microwave
oven, the aforementioned grid (3) allowing the

positioning of baby milk bottles, teats and caps,
characterised in that the bottom of the container (2)

features one or more ribs (2.1) for supporting the
grid (3), the aforementioned grid (3) being provided

with a plurality of the aforementioned means (5)
allowing the engagement and positioning of baby milk

bottles, these means (5) being formed and equipped to
ensure simultaneously that each baby milk bottle is

held by its neck and supported by its body, each one
of the aforementioned means (5) being equipped with a

shaped saddle (5.1) providing an inclined surface
(5.2) and a transverse concavity (5.8) partially

enclosing the body of the baby milk bottle, this
saddle (5.1) being extended at its lower end into a

collar form (5.3) capable of encircling the neck of
the baby milk bottle, the aforementioned collar form

(5.3) featuring an opening (5.5) perpendicular to the
surface of the saddle (5.1) for inserting the neck of

the baby milk bottle.
A sterilisation appliance according to
claim 1, characterised in that the saddle (5.1) of 

each means (5) is shaped according to a triangular
formation with its base lying in the horizontal plane

of the grid.
A sterilisation appliance according to
claims 1 and 2, characterised in that the collar form

(5.3) is fitted with an inlet port (5.4) with an
opening (5.5) for passing the neck of the baby milk

bottle, the aforementioned inlet port being extended
into a continuous elbow section (5.6) connected to

the horizontal surface of the grid, whilst a cut-out
(3.4) is made in the grid inside the inlet port to

provide communication with the bottom section of the
container and a means of access for water vapour to

enter the baby milk bottle.
A sterilisation appliance according to
claim 3, characterised in that the interior of the

inlet port features a plurality of projections (5.9)
spaced according to the screw thread incorporated on

the baby milk bottle neck, the aforementioned
projections contributing to ensure the stability of

the baby milk bottle by exerting a counter-pressure
onto its neck section.
A sterilisation appliance according to
claims 1 and 2, characterised in that the collar form

(5.3) holding the baby milk bottle neck is a flange
(5.10).
A sterilisation appliance according to any
one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in 
that the means
(5) allowing engagement and positioning of baby milk

bottles are three in number and are oriented
anglewise in equilateral triangulation according to 

an arrangement in which the rear section of one baby
milk bottle lies approximately in a plane above the

front section of the adjacent baby milk bottle body,
the degree of inclination of the saddles (5.1) being

established to prevent any mutual contact of the baby
milk bottles.
A sterilisation appliance according to any
one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the means

(5) allowing engagement and positioning of baby milk
bottles are linearly arranged in the same direction

or in alternating positions.
A sterilisation appliance according to
claim 6, characterised in that the means (5) allowing

engagement and positioning of baby milk bottles are
such that two sets of three baby milk bottles

arranged in parallel pairs according to a triangular
configuration can be placed in the appliance.
