<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a system and a process for purifying nitrogenous waste water by biological nitrification and denitrification. The system comprises at least two essentially separated reactor chambers, a liquid supply (4) and a liquid discharge (5). The first, aerated reactor chamber (1) is provided at the top with an overflow to the second, oxygen-depleted reactor chamber (2). The oxygen-depleted reactor chamber (2) is divided at the top into a degassing chamber (7) and a settling chamber (8) having an overflow (9) to the liquid discharge. The first reactor chamber is provided with an air supply (11, 18) and an air discharge (12) located above the supply. The first reactor chamber may be partly divided into a riser (14) and a downcomer (15) which allow, as a result of the air supply, mass circulation to take place in the aerated reactor chamber. According to the process, waste water with bacterial sludge on a carrier circulates alternately through the oxygen-depleted and the aerated reactor chambers, whereafter it is separated from the sludge and the sludge is returned to the reactor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention addresses the field of waste water purification. 
More particularly, the invention relates to a system for purifying 
waste water, which comprises at least two reactor chambers separated 
by a vertical wall, a liquid supply and a liquid discharge, wherein 
nitrogenous waste water is nitrified and denitrified, and to a process 
for purifying nitrogenous waste water, the water being treated with 
microorganisms alternately in an oxygen-depleted chamber and an 
oxygen-rich chamber and then being separated from the microorganisms. EP-A-233466 discloses a system and a process for the biological 
purification of waste water, wherein BOD decomposition, nitrification 
and denitrification are carried out simultaneously in a reactor in 
which there are microorganisms attached to a carrier. The carrier type 
is such that the biomass can move freely through the waste water. The 
purified water and the sludge are then separated in a secondary 
settling tank, whereafter the sludge is returned to the reactor. EP-A-24758 discloses a process and a system for oxidative 
biological purification of waste water, the waste water being passed 
upwards through an oxidation chamber in which there are microorganisms 
attached to an insoluble carrier. Separation of the purified waste 
water and the active sludge takes place at the top of the oxidation 
chamber, all of the sludge being returned to the oxidation chamber. In 
this case, both COD purification and nitrification take place. EP-A-28846 discloses a process for preparing biomass attached 
to a carrier, the carrier, for example sand, being brought into 
contact, while being aerated using a sufficient amount of mechanical 
energy, with a liquid which contains the required microorganisms and 
nutrients. A process and an apparatus for aerobic treatment of waste water 
are known from EP-A-268225. The apparatus is divided in two reaction 
chambers, one being gas-rich and the other being gas-depleted, and is 
provided with a settling chamber.  
 EP-A-399380 discloses an apparatus suitable for denitrification 
and nitrification of waste water comprising a reactor having an 
internal vertical division allowing a circulation of the waste water 
with filling material carrying the biomass. A denitrifying zone is 
provided in the funnel-shaped bottom part of the reactor. The object of the present invention is to provide an improved 
system and an improved process for biological purification of nitrogenous 
waste water, in which the nitrogenous components are, as far as
