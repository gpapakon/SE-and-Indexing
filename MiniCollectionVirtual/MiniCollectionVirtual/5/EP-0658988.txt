<ABSTRACT>
Dispersion compensation is achieved in an optical communications 
system by using an optical circulator (5) with first, second, and third ports (A,B,C). 

The first and third ports (A,C) are connected to system optical fibers (3,7). The 
second port (B) is connected to a dispersion compensating fiber (11) and return 

means (13). The signal passes through the dispersion compensating fiber (11) twice 
permitting shorter dispersion compensating fibers to be used than were previously 

used. A Faraday rotator may be used to compensate for the polarization mode 
dispersion of the fiber.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the field of optical communications
and particularly to optical communications which compensates for dispersion such
as that in optical fibers.Optical communications systems using optical fibers to couple a light
source, such as a laser, and a photodetector are now widely used for high speed, for
example, Gbit/sec data rates, and long distance, for example, trans-Atlantic or trans-Pacific,
communications. Many technical problems had to be overcome for these
systems to reach their present state of development. Perhaps the most widely known
problem was caused by the lossy nature of the first silica based optical fibers. The
loss in such fibers was greatly reduced, to the order of a tenth of a dB/km or even
less, by the development of fibers fabrications techniques that greatly reduced the
presence of loss creating impurities in the fibers.After low loss optical fibers had been developed, other system
parameters became important to the further development of optical communications
systems. For example, fibers have chromatic dispersion; that is, the propagation
velocity of the radiation depends upon its frequency. Narrow band light sources in
the form of solid state lasers were developed. These lasers typically radiated in
several relatively closely spaced modes which propagated at different velocities.
The presence of multiple modes and the existence of chromatic dispersion, limited
either the data transmission rate or the transmission distance. Radiation sources,
such as distributed feedback(DFB) lasers, that emitted only a single mode were
developed to overcome these problems.However, even the single mode of lasers has a finite linewidth which
caused a pulse to spread when chromatic dispersion was present. One approach to
solving this problem developed dispersion shifted fibers which are often referred to
by the acronym DSF. Dispersion shifted fibers have a region of very low or no
chromatic dispersion. However, the use of such fibers suffers from several
drawbacks. First, the laser must be selected so that it emits at the frequency at which
the fiber has no chromatic dispersion. Second, much non-dispersion shifted fiber has
already been installed.Other techniques that compensate for fiber chromatic dispersion are
desirable if they overcome the previously discussed limitations imposed by non-dispersion
shifted fibers. One technique inserts, at an arbitrary point in the 
transmission path between the transmitter and receiver, a dispersion compensating fiber
(DCF). The
