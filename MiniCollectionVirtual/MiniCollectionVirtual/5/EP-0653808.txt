<ABSTRACT>
Female electrical contact of the socket type, comprising a tubular body (1) defining a housing (3) provided with a front entry orifice (4) in order to receive a male electrical contact of the pin type and several elastically deformable contact blades (5) which are centrally curved radially inwards and which extend substantially longitudinally, being distributed according to a cylinder in order to form a cage, the said blades (5) being fastened to the body by one of their ends, characterised in that the blades are fixed to the body on the side of their front end and in that the front ends of the blades are joined together by a front ring (9) which closely follows the contour of the housing (3) in the vicinity of the entry orifice (4) of the latter and which is fastened to the latter.

<CLAIMS>
A female electrical contact of the socket type comprising 
a tubular body (1) defining a housing (3) provided with a 

front inlet orifice (4) for receiving a male electrical 
contact of the pin type, and a plurality of elastically 

deformable contact springs (5) which are curved radially 
inwards and which extend substantially longitudinally, being 

distributed in a cylinder to constitute a cage, said springs 
(5) being secured to the body adjacent to their front ends, 

the front ends of the springs being connected to one another 
by a front ring (9) which fits over the outline of the 

housing (3) in the vicinity of its inlet orifice (4) and is 
secured thereto,
 
characterized in that the rear ends of the springs are also 

connected to one another by means of a rear ring (13) whose 
transverse size is smaller than that of the housing (3) and 

which is free to move longitudinally inside the housing, and 
in that it is the respective central zones of the springs 

which are curved radially inwards. 
An electrical contact according to claim 1,
 
characterized in that the springs (5) and the front and rear 

rings (9, 13) constitute a single part (11, 12), in particular 
obtained by cutting out metal sheet and then rolling it 

up. 
An electrical contact according to anyone of claims 1 and 
2, characterized in that the front ring (9) is secured to 

the tubular body (1) by crimping to the inlet orifice (4) 
thereof. 
An electrical contact according to claim 3,
 
characterized in that the inlet orifice (4) of the tubular 

body (1) has a flare that is open towards the outside, in 
that the front ring has a flare that is open towards the 

front and that is complementary in shape to the flare of the  
 

tubular body so as to bear thereagainst, and in that the 
front edge (10) of the inlet orifice is folded over to 

extend radially in front of the front edge of the front ring 
and thus retain said ring.
