<ABSTRACT>
A scanning radiographic densitometer constructs a broad area, two-dimensional projection image from a combination of a set of smaller fan beam scans by tilting the axis of each such smaller scan to construct an effective larger fan beam to reduce artifacts caused by height dependent overlap of the multiple fan beams. The data is projected to a non-planar image surface to eliminate local area distortion such as may cause error in density measurements and to permit some overlap without height sensitive effects.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to 
radiographic instruments and more particularly to an 
apparatus for assembling broad area images from narrow 
beam radiographic scans. Scanning radiographic equipment differs from 
conventional radiography in that it employs a narrowly 
collimated beam of radiation, typically x-rays formed 
into, for example, a fan beam, rather than a broad area 
cone beam. The small beam size used in scanning 
radiographic equipment allows replacement of an image 
forming sheet of radiographic film, used with 
conventional radiographic equipment, with a small area 
array of detector elements. The detector elements receiving the transmitted 
radiation produce electrical signals which may be 
converted to digital values by an analog to digital 
converter for the later development of an image or for 
other processing by computer equipment. The ability to 
quantify the measurement of the transmitted radiation, 
implicit in the digitization by the analog to digital 
converter, allows not only the formation of a 
radiographic "attenuation" image but also the 
mathematical analysis of the composition of the  
 
attenuating material by dual energy techniques. See 
generally, "Generalized Image Combinations in Dual KVP 
Digital Radiography", by Lehmann et al. Med. Phys. 8(5) 
Sept/Oct 1981. Such dual energy techniques 
quantitatively compare the attenuation of radiation at 
two energies to distinguish, for example, between bone 
and soft tissue. Dual energy techniques allow the 
measurement of bone mass, such measurement being 
important in the treatment of osteoporosis and other bone 
diseases. The limited area of the beam of radiation used in 
scanning radiographic systems allows the use of limited 
area detectors permitting high resolution with relatively 
lower cost. The limited area of the detectors, however 
requires that the beam be scanned along several adjacent 
paths if large area images are to be constructed. 
Typically, a fan beam will be scanned in a raster pattern 
over the area to be measured, each line of the scan 
separated by somewhat less than the width of fan beam, to 
ensure complete illumination of the entire volume of the 
imaged object, with the directions of scanning being 
generally perpendicular to the direction of the radiation 
and the plane of the fan beam. Images formed by a scanning radiographic system are 
potentially more accurate than those produced by a 
typical broad beam radiograph system. This accuracy 
arises from the limited divergence, in the
