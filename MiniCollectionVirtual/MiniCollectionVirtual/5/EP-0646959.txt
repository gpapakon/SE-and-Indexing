<ABSTRACT>
A metallization and bonding process for manufacturing a 
power semiconductor device comprises a step of deposition of a 

first metal layer (12;25) over the entire surface of a chip; a 
step of selective etching of the first metal layer (12;25) to 

form desired patterns of metal interconnection lines between 
components previously defined; a step of deposition of a layer 

(13) of passivating material over the entire surface of the 
chip; a step of selective etching of the layer (13) of 

passivating material down to the first metal layer (12;25) to 
define bonding areas (14,15;27,28) represented by uncovered 

portions of the first metal layer (12;25); a step of deposition 
of a thick second metal layer (16;29) over the entire surface 

of the chip; a step of selective etching of the second metal 
layer (16;29) down to the layer (13) of passivating material to 

remove the second metal layer (16;29) outside said bonding 
areas (14,15;27,28); and a step of connection of bonding wires 

(17,18;30,31) to the surface of the second metal layer (16;29) 
in correspondance of said bonding areas (14,15;27,28).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a metallization and bonding
process for manufacturing power semiconductor devices.In the last few years, a fast technological evolution in the
field of power semiconductor devices has made available, among
the others, power MOSFETs with low values of the "on"
resistance (RDS(on)), and Power Integrated Circuits (PICs)
performing complex functions and capable to switch rather high
power values.PICs are characterized by high levels of components
integration density; metal layers should therefore allow a high
interconnection density and introduce low series resistances:
since these two requirements are in contrast to each other, a
trade off value for the thickness of the metal layer must be
found. Such thickness values are generally so low that
dedicated areas on the die surface, distinct from the active
areas wherein the various components are defined, have to be
reserved for the attachment (bonding) of leads to the die, as
they could perforate the metal layer and damage the underlying
integrated circuit. As a result the device area increases, and
parasitic resistances due to the necessity of long
interconnection lines between the active area and the bonding
region are introduced.Power MOSFETs are less sensitive to integration density
problems, but it is extremely important to reduce as far as
possible all parasitic resistances so that low values of the
RDS(on) can be attained, and thus bond the leads directly on
the active area. To prevent the bonding wires from perforating 
the metallization, this layer should have a rather high
thickness, typically greater than 3 Âµm. Such a thick layer
results in problems in both manufacturing and reliability,
since the step coverage characteristics of a layer by a
superimposed layer get worse as the step height increases.To prevent damages in the bonding process, the maximum
diameter of a bonding wire is generally determined by the
metallization layer thickness. To avoid the parasitic
resistance of the bonding wire from affecting the MOSFET
RDS(on), it is possible to bond in parallel two or more wires
of smaller diameter, with an increase in costs.The document JP-A-58 199 533 describes a technique for improving the high frequency features of a semiconductor device by interposing a thick Al layer between a Mo metal layer and a Au wire terminal.In view of the state of art just described, the object of
the present invention is to accomplish a process for the
metallization and bonding of leads to a power semiconductor
device, which is not
