<ABSTRACT>
An X-ray generation tube capable of ionizing gas over 
a wide area of ambient gas by radiating X-rays in various 

directions. The X-ray generation tube includes a tubular 
container body (10) formed of an X-ray transmissible 

material. The container body (10) has a cylindrical shape 
or a toroidal shape (110). A target membrane (40) is 

formed on the entire inner surface of the container body 
(10) for receiving electrons and emitting X-rays. Bases 

(20) are provided at both ends of the container body (10) 
and have pins (24, 26). A cathode (30) is supported by the 

pins (24, 26) and is disposed along the locus of the 
container body (10) for generating the electrons. Since 

the distance between all of the points on the target 
membrane (40) and the cathode (30) is substantially equal 

with respect to a cross section or radial direction of the 
container body (10), and since the target membrane (40) is 

provided over the entire inner surface of the container 
body, X-rays are radiated from the entire outer surface of 

the container body (10), and uniform radiation results.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a transmission type 
X-ray generation tube having an X-ray window and a target, 
and more particularly, to a type thereof capable of providing 
ionization to ambient atmosphere. Recently, gas ionization to the ambient air or gas is 
required for neutralization of a charged article, or for 
providing a negative ion atmosphere for human comfort. 
Further, positive gas ionization is also used for sterilization 
to the ambient atmosphere. To this effect, Japanese Patent Application Kokai No. 
Sho-62-44936 discloses an ion beam generation system 
provided with a synchrotron radiation device. However, no 
proposals have yet been made in connection with the employment 
of the transmission type X-ray generation tube 
for this purpose. A transmission type X-ray generation tube has been 
known which generates relatively weak X-ray having specific 
wavelength for the purpose of analysis of a substance  
 
or diagnosis. In this case, the image pick-up is made for 
concentrating X-rays to a desired limited area. The conventional transmission type X-ray generation 
tube includes a cathode which releases electrons, a grid 
for controlling the orientation of the electrons, a transmission 
type target which receives the electrons at one 
surface thereof and emits X-rays from opposite surface, 
and an X-ray transmission window for releasing the X-rays 
outside. These are accommodated in a cylindrical hermetic 
container body. Such conventional tube is disclosed in 
Japanese Patent Application Kokoku No.Sho-37-5501 and 
Japanese Patent Application Kokai No. Hei-2-297850. In such a conventional transmission type X-ray generation 
tube, the X-rays are to be radiated to a limited 
specific area for the image pick-up, and therefore, the 
grid is used for directing the generated electrons to a 
concentrated area in order to provide a point radiation 
source. In this case, several electrons generated from the 
cathode may not reach the target due to inaccuracy in 
control by the grid. Such a conventional X-ray generation 
tube may not be available for providing ionization atmosphere 
for an extended or wide area.  According to this invention, an X-ray generation tube 
for radiating X-rays over a wide area to ionise an ambient 
gas comprises:
 
   a container body formed of an X-ray transmissible 
material and having an inner peripheral surface and first 
and second open ends, the container body having a tubular 
shape which has a circular cross section, the tubular 
shape defining therein a
