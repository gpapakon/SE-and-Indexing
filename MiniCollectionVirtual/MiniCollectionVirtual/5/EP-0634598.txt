<ABSTRACT>
A quick-coupling joint for ducts of air-conditioning units, 
includes a box profiled member (1) made of plastic and having a 

rubber gasket (26). The profiled member (1) has a much higher thermal 
insulation than conventional profiled members and the gasket (26) 

ensures very good airtightness.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a quick-coupling joint 
for ducts of air-conditioning units. Metal ducts of air-conditioning units were usually joined by 
welding or by means of flanges formed by bending the edges 
of the segments and locked by U-bolts, staples, bolts and 
the like. These joining systems had various drawbacks, including in 
particular an onerous and complicated execution on site, and 
while welding could produce damaging corrosion, the other 
methods hardly ensured good airtightness. This same Applicant long ago developed a joining system 
constituted by L-shaped box profiled members that can be 
applied to the edges of the duct segment, which usually has 
a rectangular or square cross-section, in mutually 
perpendicular positions. An L-shaped member is coupled to 
each pair of mutually perpendicular profiled members to 
stiffen and lock the profiled members to the segment with 
the additional purpose of mutually locking the segments to 
be joined. This system has proved itself highly advantageous from all 
points of view and has of course undergone improvements and 
modifications in the course of time. Reference should be made for example to the Italian utility 
model No. 216771 and to the Italian utility model 
application No. MI910 00029 in the name of this same  
 
Applicant, which describe locking devices of the above 
mentioned type according to the most recent developments. The aim of the present invention is to provide an improved 
joining device that ensures a significantly higher degree of 
insulation than known systems. Within the scope of this aim, an object of the invention is 
to provide a lighter device. Another important object is to provide a device that better 
complies with the recent statutory provisions concerning the 
specific issue. This aim, these objects and others which will become 
apparent hereinafter are achieved by a joining device as 
claimed in the accompanying claims. Further characteristics and advantages will become apparent 
from the description of a preferred but not exclusive 
embodiment of the invention, illustrated only by way of non-limitative 
example in the accompanying drawings, wherein: 
Figure 1 is a perspective view of the device according to 
the invention, illustrating a portion of a box profiled 
member next to a portion of a segment edge; Figure 2 is a transverse sectional view of the joining 
device in assembled condition; Figure 3 is an exploded perspective view of two duct 
segments to be joined;  Figure 4 is a front view of the

<CLAIMS>
Quick-coupling joint for ducts of air-conditioning units 
comprising at least one first duct segment (5) to be joined 

to a second segment (5), said first segment comprising at 
least a first wall (3) and a second wall (3), said first 

wall being associable with a first box profiled member (1), 
said second wall being associable with a second box profiled 

member (1) which is substantially identical to said first 
profiled member (1), said first and second box profiled 

members being mutually associable by an L-shaped locking 
means (7), said first and second box profiled members 

facing corresponding box profiled members of said second 
duct segment (5), said joint being characterized in that 

said box profiled members are made of plastics, each one of 
said box profiled members comprising a first portion (9) 

which, when the structure is assembled, is located inside 
said duct and is connected to a second portion (10) that is 

at right angles to said first portion; said second portion 
comprising in turn a third portion (11) which faces a 

similar profiled member portion of the segment to be 
joined, and a fourth portion (13) which is parallel to said 

third portion; said third and fourth portions being closed 
at the top by a fifth portion (15) that comprises an edge 

(16) that protrudes from said fourth portion; said third, 
fourth and fifth portions forming an internal chamber; a 

sixth portion (17) being connected to said fourth portion 
and being substantially parallel to said first portion; said 

sixth portion comprising a curved region (19) that is 
suitable to engage an engagement means (23) formed proximate 

to the edge of the segment. 
Joint according to claim 1, characterized in that said 
 

plastics is constituted by PVC. 
Joint according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that it 
comprises a guide (25) which is formed along said second 

portion of said profiled member and is suitable to 
accommodate a cylindrical gasket (26), in assembled position 

said gasket being adapted to couple with a similar gasket of 
the facing profiled member to ensure tightness. 
Joint according to one or more of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that said guide (25) has a dovetail cross-section. 
Joint according to one or more of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that said sixth portion (17) furthermore 

comprises an end portion (21) extending beyond the end of 

said first portion so that it is optionally possible to 
apply engagement means to further lock the profiled member 

on the segment. 
Joint according to one or more of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that it comprises clip members (33) that 

can be applied to said protruding edges of the profiled 
members to fasten insulating material (31) on the outside 

of the ducts. 
Joint according to one or more of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that it comprises an L-shaped member (27) 

comprising two portions at rights angles connected to a 
central portion, said central portion having a sealing 

member (29) adapted to engage at least one portion of said 
walls.
