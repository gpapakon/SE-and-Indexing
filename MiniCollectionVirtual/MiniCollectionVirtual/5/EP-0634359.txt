<ABSTRACT>
Silicon nitride powder is prepared by 
nitriding metallic silicon powder in a nitriding 

gas atmosphere at a temperature of 1,000°C-1,500°C. 
Midway the nitriding step, the 

nitrided product is heat treated in an inert 
non-oxidizing gas atmosphere or vacuum at a 

temperature higher than the nitriding 
temperature, but lower than 1,600°C. The 

product is nitrided again, obtaining high α-content 
silicon nitride powder.

<DESCRIPTION>
This specification relates to processes for 
effectively preparing silicon nitride powder 
having a high alpha-type content. In the prior art, silicon nitride powder 
is generally prepared by a direct nitriding 
reaction of metallic silicon powder in a 
non-oxidizing atmosphere containing nitrogen 
gas or ammonia gas at a temperature of 1,000 to 
1,500°C. This process, however, has the problem 
that once nitriding starts, a great amount of 
reaction heat is generated by the following 
reaction scheme: 
3Si + 2N2 = Si3N4 
   ΔHR = - 176 kcal/mol 
raising the temperature of the reaction system 
so that the amount of beta-type silicon nitride 
powder which is stable at higher temperature is  
 
increased. As a consequence, it was difficult 
to prepare high alpha-type silicon nitride 
powder, having an alpha content higher than 90%. Then in order to produce silicon nitride 
powder at a high alpha conversion rate, several 
approaches were taken including (i) addition of 
a catalyst as disclosed in Japanese Patent 
Application Kokai (JP-A) 15499/1979, (ii) 
slowing down the heating rate as disclosed in 
JP-A 24300/1979, and (iii) use of starting 
silicon powder with a finer particle size as 
disclosed in JP-A 41048/1983. Undesirably, the 
catalyst added in method (i) would be left in 
the nitride product as an impurity. Method (ii) 
suffered from low productivity. Method (iii) 
required a substantial cost in comminuting the 
starting metallic silicon powder. The aim herein is to provide new and useful processes 
for making high alpha-type silicon nitride using direct 
nitriding.  
 The inventors made investigations on a 
process for preparing silicon nitride powder by 
nitriding metallic silicon powder in a nitriding 
gas atmosphere. We have found that good 
results are obtained when nitriding is effected 
at a nitriding temperature in the range of 
1,000°C to 1,500°C, and during the nitriding process the 
part-nitrided product is subject to high temperature 
treatment in an inert non-oxidising 
gas atmosphere or vacuum, at an elevated 
temperature from higher than the nitriding 
temperature to 1,600°C. Preferred embodiments of the process according to the invention 
are disclosed in dependent claims 2 to 6. As a first step for effectively nitriding 
metallic silicon powder to produce high alpha-type 
silicon nitride powder, we analyzed the 
nitriding mechanism. With respect to a simple 
gas - solid reaction mechanism, there were 
proposed a number of reaction models assuming 
that the diffusion of reactant
