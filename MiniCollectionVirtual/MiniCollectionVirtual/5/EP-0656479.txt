<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a water-cooled rotary compressor comprising a housing having feet and a cooling water jacket, and comprising a rotor which is arranged eccentrically relative to the housing bore and is provided with radially movable separating dampers and whose journals are supported in bearings of covers fitted on the end faces of the housing, and comprising in each case a flange which is arranged offset by 90 DEG  relative to the covers and serves to suck up or eject the medium (fluid). According to the invention, the centre (6) of the shaft of the rotor (5) is arranged symmetrically relative to the outer contour of the housing (2) and to the flanges (3, 4) and the housing bore (10) is arranged eccentrically in the direction of the top dead centre (17) relating thereto.

Single-stage vane compressor with two water-cooled 
covers, a water-cooled casing jacket which is divided by 

lengthwise walls, a rotor (5) which is arranged 
eccentrically with respect to the casing bore (
10) and is 
provided with radially mobile vanes (18), and two flanges 

(3, 4) arranged over the circumference and staggered at the 
casing jacket for the intake and discharge of the medium,
 
characterised in that
 
the mutually opposite flanges (3, 4) have a common axis 

which forms an axis of symmetry with respect to the outer 
contour of the casing (2) and intersects the rotor axis (6) 

perpendicularly, wherein the rotor axis (6) is an axis of 
symmetry with respect to the outer contour of the casing 

(2), the casing bore (10) is arranged eccentrically in the 
direction of the top dead centre (17) with respect to the 

axis (6) and the water jacket is divided with respect to the 
intake side (3) and delivery side (4) by two paraxial walls 

(19, 20) lying in the plane of symmetry passing through the 
top dead centre (17). 
Vane compressor according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that
 
the connection between the water jacket on the intake and on 

the delivery side is effected via the casing covers (23, 26) 
provided with recesses. 
Vane compressor according to claims 1 to 2,
 
characterised in that
 
the point of entry (21) of the cooling water is in the 

bottom dead centre region (4) and the point of emergence 
(24) of the cooling water is in the top dead centre region 

(3), which points are staggered over the longitudinal extent 
of the casing (2), the cooling water chambers (13, 14) in 

the bottom dead centre region (4) being larger than those 
(15, 16) in the top dead centre region (3).
