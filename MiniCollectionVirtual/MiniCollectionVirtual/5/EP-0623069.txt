<DESCRIPTION>
 A method of producing a three-dimensional profile in a bodyThe present invention relates to a method of producing a three-dimensional profile on an exterior surface of a body, which body is resilient and comprises a thermoplastic layer and a stretchable layer, and to the product of the method.It is known to mould thermoplastic into particular predetermined shapes, and it is further known to cover the thermoplastic with a layer of material. However, the known methods of making three-dimensional bodies of this type are limited in that the bodies which are formed cannot display complex or intricate profiles. Previously, if a three- dimensional profile with a complex or intricate profile was required, it was necessary to use injection moulding techniques. However, an injection moulding techniques could not produce articles with the look and feel of a thermoformed article.According to the present invention there is provided a method of producing a three-dimensional profile on an exterior surface of a body, which body comprises a thermoplastics layer and a stretchable layer bonded to the exterior surface; the thermoplastics layer being thermoformed in a mould to produce the profile; the stretchable layer being such and being bonded over substantially the entire exterior surface of the thermoplastics layer, in such a way that the profile formed is highly defined.The profile formed by the method of the present invention is capable of displaying sharp contours with the angle of the exterior surface changing greatly over a short distance of the surface. This enables the profile to be very detailed, that is highly defined. 

 The precise thermoplastic used will vary depending upon the physical conditions employed during the thermoforming process. The thermoplastic must be of such a type that it can be moulded to the exact profile of the mould and after it has been moulded, the thermoplastic must be removable from the mould without permanent deformation of the profile formed by the mould. Preferably, when thermoforming process forms the profile, and the mould is removed, the thermoplastic is permanently deformed and does not have a tendency to spring into another shape. Preferably, the thermoplastics layer is a foam, preferably having a nominal density of between 20 and 40 Kg m3, preferably between 29 and 36 Kg m3, and in a preferred embodiment 33 Kg m3, and the foam has a thickness of between 5 and 11 mm, preferably 8 mm, prior to moulding. The foam is preferably made of polyethylene.Preferably, the thermoforming
