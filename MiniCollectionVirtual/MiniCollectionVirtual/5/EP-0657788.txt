<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fuser member and a fusing 
system for fusing toner images in electrostatographic printing apparatus. 
In particular, it relates to a long-life fuser member and more specifically to a 
back up pressure roll in a fusing system which includes a fuser roll and a 
pressure roll. In a typical electrostatographic reproducing apparatus, a light 
image of an original to be copied is recorded in the form an electrostatic 
latent image upon a photosensitive member and the latent image is 
subsequently rendered visible by the application of electroscopic 
thermoplastic resin particles which are commonly referred to as toner. The 
visible toner image is then in a loose powdered form and can be easily 
disturbed or destroyed. The toner image is usually fixed or fused upon a 
support which may be photosensitive member itself or other support sheet 
such as plain paper. The use of thermal energy for fixing toner images onto a 
support member is well known. In order to fuse electroscopic toner 
material onto a support surface permanently by heat, it is necessary to 
elevate the temperature of the toner material to a point at which the 
constituents of the toner material coalesce and become tacky. This heating 
causes the toner to flow to some extent into the fibers or pores of the 
support member. Thereafter, as the toner material cools, solidification of 
the toner material causes the toner material to be firmly bonded to the 
support. Typically, thermoplastic resin particles are fused to the substrate 
by heating to a temperature of between about 90° C to about 160° C or 
higher depending upon the softening range of the particular resin used in  
 
the toner. It is not desirable, however, to raise the temperature of the 
substrate substantially higher than about 200° C because of the tendency of 
the substrate to discolor at such elevated temperatures particularly when 
the substrate is paper. Several approaches to thermal fusing of electroscopic toner 
images have been described in the prior art. These methods include 
providing the application of heat and pressure substantially concurrently by 
various means: a roll pair maintained in pressure contact; a belt member in 
pressure contact with a roll; and the like. Heat may be applied by heating 
one or both of the rolls, plate members or belt members. The fusing of the 
toner particles takes place when the proper combination of heat, pressure 
and contact time are provided. The balancing of these parameters to bring 
about the
