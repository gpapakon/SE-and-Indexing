<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an attractively designed and space-saving container for hinged compact-disc cases, which simplifies and facilitates the opening of the hinged cases received by it. In this arrangement, the cover part is held by a holding device located on the holding frame, but the grasped hinge case is left free at least on its entire underside and on the upper side in an area close to the edge to be opened, so that the holding frames can assume a position with respect to the holder in which the space underneath the hinged case is free over a height of at least a few cm. The projections of the holding device, whose bearing surface is approximately horizontal and whose contact surfaces are bevelled or rounded, engage in openings of the cover part. The holding frame has side legs extending along the sides of the hinged case and consisting of flexible material, which legs may be pivotable, are adjustable with respect to one another and are pressed by means of a spring into a position of rest. Introduction of the hinged cases is possible from below upwards, since the side legs can also be tilted. Similarly, the pivoting for at least 90 DEG allows the bottom part of the introduced hinged case to be opened up downwards. The said bottom part is caught by a spring platelet which is fastened on the underside of the holding frame.

<CLAIMS>
A storage arrangement having a plurality of adjacently arranged
holding frames (2) which are suitable for accommodating hinged cases (3) for

compact discs.

which comprise a bottom portion (5) and a lid portion (7) which can
be hinged open relative to each other about an axis (13), wherein the side

walls (8) of the lid portion (7) in the closed condition are disposed
outside the side walls (6) of the bottom portion (5).
having a holding device on each holding frame (2) for holding the
lid portion (7) at at least one of the two parallel sides which are adjacent

to the axis (13) of the hinged cases (3).
wherein the holding frame (2) leaves free the bottom portion (5) at
the whole of the underside and the lid portion (7) in the region adjacent

the edge opposite to the axis (13), and
wherein each holding frame (2) can be brought with respect to the
other holding frames into a position in which the bottom portion (5) can be

hinged out downwardly.

characterised in that

each holding frame (2) has two side limbs (20, 20') which have the
holding devices (16) and which so embrace the lid portion that they each

extend along a respective one of the two parallel sides of the lid portion
(7), which are adjacent to the axis (13) of the hinged case (3).
the individual holding frames (2) are pivotable through at least 90Â°
about a perpendicular rotary axis (24).
the rotary axis (24) extends upwardly from a base plate (33), and
in that arrangement the holding frames (2) are substantially so
stacked in vertically mutually superposed relationship that in the outwardly

pivoted position of a holding frame (2) the space beneath the holding frame
is free for pivoting out the lid portion (7) to some centimetres.

stacked in vertically mutually superposed relationship that in the outwardly

pulled position of a holding frame (2) the space beneath the holding frame
is free for pivoting out the lid portion (7) to some centimetres.
A holder according to claim 1 or claim 2 characterised in that as
the holding device projections (16) on the holding frame (2) engage into

openings (10) arranged in the side walls (8) of the lid portion (7) beneath
the lid panel which connects the side walls. 
A holder according to claim 3 characterised in that projections
(16) which are arranged on mutually opposite sides of the hinged cases (3)

and which are directed towards each other are movable away from the rest
position of engaging into the openings (10) and away from each other to such

an extent that the hinged case (3) is removable from the holding frame (2).
