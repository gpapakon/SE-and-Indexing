<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a combustion chamber including an outer wall, and an inner wall, a back joining the said walls, external (9) and internal (12) fuel injectors and a gas separator assembly (15) which includes outer (17C) and inner (18C) axial faces, a transverse downstream end face (20) joining the downstream ends of the outer and inner axial faces. According to the invention, axial grooves (23, 24) made in the outer (17C) and inner (18C) axial faces open into the said axial faces (17C, 18C) and into the transverse downstream end face (20). One application is the production of a combustion chamber having high efficiency during its various operating modes.

<CLAIMS>
Combustion chamber assembly having: 

a structure of an external wall (2) and of an 
internal wall (3), each of annular shape having an axis 

(1) of almost symmetry common to this external wall and 
to this internal wall, and of an end (4) joining together 

the said external wall and the said internal wall, the 
external wall, the internal wall and the end together 

delimiting a combustion chamber (5); 
fuel injectors split into two distinct groups of 
external fuel injectors (9) and internal fuel injectors 

(12) which are intended, preferably the external fuel 
injectors (9) to supply fuel in a first operating mode 

and, the internal fuel injectors (12) to supply fuel 
during a second operating mode; and, 
a gas flow separator assembly (15), which 
includes an external axial face (17C) and an internal 

axial face (18C) which are spaced apart, each face having 
an overall shape which is almost symmetrical with respect 

to the said common axis of symmetry (1), an almost 
circular transverse section, an upstream end (19) and a 

downstream end (20), the said gas flow separator assembly 
also including a downstream end transverse face (20C) 

connecting the downstream ends of the external axial face 
(17C) and internal axial face (18C), this gas flow 

separator assembly being interposed between the external 
fuel injectors (9) and the internal fuel injectors (12) 

and being fixed (21) to the said structure; 
 
   characterized in that axial grooves (23, 24) are 

formed in each of the, external and internal, axial faces 
and extend between, on the one hand, an intermediate line  

 
between the said upstream end (19) and downstream end 

(20) of the said axial face and, on the other hand, the 
downstream end (20) of the said axial face, and open into 

this axial face (17C, 18C) and into the said downstream 
end transverse face (20). 
Combustion chamber assembly according to Claim 1,
 
   characterized in that the depth (P23, P24) of a 

groove (23, 24) increases along the length of the said 
groove from the said intermediate line (17D, 18D) as far 

as the said downstream end (20) of the axial face. 
Combustion chamber assembly according to either 
of Claims 1 and 2,
 
   characterized in that the width (L23, L24) of a 

groove (23, 24) increases along the length of the said 
groove from the said intermediate line (17D, 18D) as far 

as the said downstream end (20) of the axial face. 
Combustion chamber assembly according to any one 
of Claims 1 to 3,
 
   characterized in that the said gas flow separator 

assembly comprises an external wall (17), an internal 
wall (18) and a downstream end wall (20) which together 

delimit a hollow body (22), while the said grooves (23, 
24) are obtained by stamping the said external wall and 

internal wall. 
Combustion chamber assembly according to any one 
of Claims 1 to 4,
 
   characterized in that the grooves (23, 24) made 

in the said external axial face (17C) and internal axial 
face (18C) are contained, in pairs, in common radial 

planes (M23/24), one groove (23) of a pair being formed 
in the external axial face (17C) and the other groove 

(24) of the said pair being formed in the internal axial 
face (18C). 
Combustion chamber assembly according to any one 
of Claims 1 to 4,
 
   characterized in that the grooves (23) formed in 

the said external axial face (17C) are contained in 
radial planes (M23) which are interposed between radial 

planes (M24) containing the grooves (24) formed in the  
 

external axial face (18C). 
Combustion chamber assembly according to any one 
of Claims 1 to 6,
 
   characterized in that the gas flow separator 

assembly (15) is monobloc and of annular shape.
