<ABSTRACT>
Method and device for optical inspection of objects, components and/or workpieces made of or comprising transparent material, especially of those with inherent structure, preferably for inspecting headlight glasses (lenses), test light being passed through the said objects and scattered or defracted light generated by material and/or surface inhomogeneities or defects, emerging after extraction of primary light essentially in the radiation direction (forward-scattered) being used for defect recognition and evaluation with a spatially synchronous relation between the region of the object through which the test light passes in each case and the scattered light received by a photodetector or the like, characterised in that a region of the transparent material of the object, component and/or workpiece, respectively to be examined, is scanned by transmission using a beam of preferably parallel test light, especially a test laser beam, having a small cross-sectional area, especially an essentially point-like cross-section.
