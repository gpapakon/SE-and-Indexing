<ABSTRACT>
An MR head of a simpler structure, with a reduced 
Barkhausen noise and a high sensitivity comprises a 

ferromagnetic MR layer (12) and a bias layer (13) in direct contact 
with the MR layer thereby providing an exchange magnetic 

coupling to the MR layer. The MR layer (12) has a sensing area (15) 
for a sense current flowing in the direction of the uniaxial 

anisotropy of the MR layer. The sensing area defines, as 
one peripheral edge (17) thereof, an inlet (19) for receiving magnetic 

signal fields from a magnetic recording medium. The bias 
layer (13) is formed of an antiferromagnetic material or a 

ferrimagnetic material, and the direction of the uniaxial 
magnetic anisotropy (21) of the bias layer is set at 45° from 

the direction of the sense current, thereby applying a bias 
magnetic field effective in transverse and longitudinal 

directions relative to the sense current. The bias layer (13) 
surrounds the sensing area (15) of the MR layer except for the 

inlet side (19) of the sensing area.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magnetoresistive
(MR) sensor according to the preamble of claim 1 and a method for manufacturing an MR sensor, and
more particularly, to an MR sensor for use in an MR head for
reading out data stored on a magnetic recording medium by
utilizing the MR effect of a ferromagnetic MR layer and a
method for manufacturing the same.Based on a fact that a large output signal is
obtained from an MR sensor (or element) and the signal is
not affected by the relative speed between the sensor and a
magnetic recording medium, application of an MR sensor to a
reproducing head of a compact magnetic recording device
having a high recording density has been expected. However,
in order to put an MR sensor to a practical use as the
reproducing head of the magnetic recording device, two
fundamental requirements should be met.One of the requirements is to make the MR sensor
linearly respond to the magnetic signal provided by a 
magnetic recording medium. To meet this requirement, an MR
sensor must be applied with a bias magnetic field in a
direction normal to a sense current (the magnetic field will
be referred to as "transverse bias field" hereinafter) so
that the angle  between the sense current and the direction
of magnetization of the MR layer forms a predetermined
angle, preferably 45° . Various means have been proposed
for applying a transverse bias field to the MR sensor. US-A-4,663,685 describes a magnetoresistive sensor in which an MR layer has a
uniaxial anisotropy. In this publication an exchange bias layer has a uniaxial
anisotropy and being magnetized provides an exchange coupling to the MR layer. Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 49(1974)-74523
describes a structure in which an MR sensor has a
laminate of an MR layer and a conductive shunt layer having
a predetermined resistance. In this publication, a
transverse bias field is applied by a branch current flowing
through the shunt layer.Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 52(1977)-62417
describes another MR sensor comprising a laminate
including a bias layer, in which a non-magnetic intermediate
layer is sandwiched between a soft magnetic bias layer and
an MR layer. In this publication, the soft magnetic bias
layer is magnetized by a sense current supplied to the MR
layer, and in turn generates a transverse bias filed.The other requirement is to suppress the Barkhausen
effect which generates a noise (Barkhausen noise) in a
reproduced signal and deteriorates the reproducibility of
stored signals. The Barkhausen
