<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of frequency multiplexing of a sound signal (SON) established in a given frequency band (fm, fM) and of a data signal (DATA) established in a first portion (fD1, fD2) included in the said given frequency band (fm, fM). The method comprises the measurement of the power of the sound signal (SON) in a second portion (fM1, fM2) included in the given frequency band (fm, fM) and separate from the said first portion (fD1, fD2), the frequency multiplexing of the data signal (DATA) with the sound signal (SON) when the measured power (SM) is above a threshold, and either the transmission of the multiplexed signal (SDS) when the measured power (SM) is above the said threshold, or else the transmission of the sound signal (SON) when the measured power is below the said threshold. The data signal thus transmitted is sufficiently inaudible for it to be processed directly at output of a loudspeaker or of a sound or peritelevision outlet.
