<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a dry flower coated
on its surface with a silicone polymer film and to a
process for producing the same.The term "dry flower" used herein means a dried
flower, stem, and leaf. Note that, here, "dried"
includes in addition to just removal of moisture by
evaporation the substantive removal of moisture by
substitution of moisture with another organic compound
etc.The dry flower according to the present invention is
water repellent, so is resistant to absorption of
moisture even under humid conditions and therefore can be
kept from discoloring or molding due to the inclusion of
moisture and, as a result, will not change in the color
or the shape of its flower, leaf (or leaves) and stem
even under severe conditions.The conventional process for the production of a dry
flower has been to dry a fresh flower with a silica gel.
To boost the efficiency of this, various salts have been
added and various sources of heat used so as to raise the
uniformity of the drying.A conventional dry flower, however, absorbs moisture
when placed under relatively high humidity conditions,
and therefore, quickly discolors or molds and changes
from its original appearance. To prevent this, it may be
considered to provide a coating of a water repellent
polymer, but if a flower is immersed in a polymer
solution, the polymer will cover the surface of the
flower thickly and the original form cannot be
maintained.On the other hand, for the purpose of maintaining
the color and shape of a cut flower and dry flower, it 
has been proposed to coat the surfaces with an adhesive
(Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 59-44301,
Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No.
59-227801) or a viscous agent (Japanese Unexamined Patent
Publication (Kokai) No. 62-265202). In each case,
however, the treatment solution is applied to the object
to be treated by brushing, spraying, immersion, etc. The
surface of the flower is heavily coated with the adhesive
or viscous agent, so there is the disadvantage that the
original natural appearance cannot actually be
maintained.It is so in Japanese patent applications published
under No. JP 54135078, JP-A-03294202 and JP-A-02304002
wherein a dried plant or flower is coated with a film by
spraying or dipping and in JP-A-53141741 wherein a dried
plant or animal is immersed in a coating liquid.In the Canadian patent application published under No.
CA-A-2,020,360, freshly-cut flowers are freeze-dried and
coated by a vapor polymerization of parylene, i.e., a
thermoplast
