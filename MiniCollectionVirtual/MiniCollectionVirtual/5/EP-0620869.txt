<ABSTRACT>
The invention is a method for the accurate control of the conversion film thickness produced on aluminiferous metal materials by fluorine-containing acidic conversion treatment baths; and a simple method for determining the EFC value (Effective Fluorine Concentration). The EFC value is determined by potentiometric titration of a fluorine-containing acidic conversion treatment bath having pH 
<
 4 without prior pH adjustment using a fluorine ion electrode as indicator electrode. The titrant is an aqueous solution containing the Al ion, La ion, Y ion, Zr ion, Ga ion, Ce ion, or Be ion, an inflection point in the potential curve is used as an indication of the activity of the conversion treatment bath.

<DESCRIPTION>
A METHOD FOR THE ACIDIC CONVERSION TREATMENT OF ALUMINUMCONTAINING METALField of the InventionThe invention relates to a method for surface treatment of aluminiferous metal-containing structures with acidic conversion treatment baths. The method is particularly useful for treating the surfaces of car bodies, household electrical appliances, and the like, with phosphate conversion coating baths, chromate treatment baths, and they like. Particularly, the present invention relates to a method for reproducibly controlling the chemical activity of fluorine in conversion treatment baths. Background of the InventionThe addition of fluorine to acidic conversion treatment baths for treating aluminiferous metal-containing structures is well known. One example of this methodology is taught in Japanese Patent Application Sho 63-157879 (157,879/1988) . Related ArtThe fluoride ion concentration in an aqueous solution is generally measured directly using a fluorine ion meter. Japanese Patent Application Sho 63-17879 discloses a measurement method that relates to phosphate conversion treatment solutions. In the disclosed method, the fluoride ion concentration in a sample is measured after calibration 

 of the fluorine ion electrode with fluorine reference solutions of known fluorine ion concentration. Using the fluoride ion concentration calculated based on the results of this measurement the phosphate conversion treatment is operated by adjusting the bath components to maintain the fluoride ion concentration within a specified range.A chromate conversion treatment wherein the fluoride ion concentration is maintained within a prescribed range is disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Hei 3-48271 (48,271/1991).Although not intended for controlling the activity of conversion treatment baths, a method is disclosed in Z. Anal. Chem. 245 67 (1969) for the measurement of fluorine concentration through a potentiometric titration which uses a fluorine ion electrode as indicator electrode, and an aluminum nitrate solution, lanthanum nitrate solution, or the like as titrant. The method measures the total fluorine content in aqueous solutions, and requires that the sample be pre-treated by adjustment of the pH to a range of 4 to 7.Several problems are associated with direct concentration measurement of the fluoride ion concentration in acidic conversion treatment baths using a fluorine ion meter. The fluorine ion electrode ultimately degrades with time during the measurement process, which necessitates frequent calibration
