<ABSTRACT>
It has been found that hosts which are susceptible to nematode parasite infections can readily be protected from such infections when the parasites are not adapted for a parasite/host relationship to this host. In particular, feline hosts were immunized against heartworm using a variety of antigens derived from Dirofilaria immitis and related nematodes. Because cats are hosts susceptible to this nonadapted parasite, such antigens are successfully protective.

<DESCRIPTION>
 VACCINE FOR SUSCEPTIBLE HOSTSAGAINST NONADAPTED PARASITESTechnical FieldThe invention is directed to methods to protect susceptible animals against infection by nematode parasites where the parasites are generally nonadapted to a long-term parasite/host relationship with the host. In particular, the invention concerns protection of cats against heartworm infection.Background ArtParasitic infections generally depend on the ability of the parasite to establish a relationship with the host which, while detrimental to the robust good health of the host, is sufficiently benign to assure the parasite of a sufficiently long-term relationship to continue its own life cycle. An example of such a parasitic relationship is that of heartworm in dogs. Heartworm infection is very common and caused by the nematode, Dirofilaria immitis. Heartworm primarily affects dogs; indeed, in some geographical areas many canines are carriers of this parasite. On the other hand, only a relatively small number of cats in enzootic areas, probably less than 15%, harbor this nematode. It is currently not understood why cats, while susceptible, appear to react to infection differently from their canine counterparts.Heartworm infection in dogs occurs through passage of the third stage larvae (L3) of D. immitis into the subcutaneous tissue as a result of a mosquito bite. 

In the subcutaneous tissue, the L3 larvae molt into a fourth larval stage (L4) which then migrates toward the thoracic cavity. A subsequent molt to an immature adult occurs and the immature adult gains access to the heart and pulmonary arteries where maturity into adulthood occurs. The L3 remain near the site of infection; L4 migrate through the cutaneous tissue and muscle and do not molt to the fifth stage until 50-70 days after infection, "the adult D. immitis are on the order of 12- 20 cm (males) and 25-31 cm (females) and produce motile vermiform embryos called microfilariae which are only 0.3 mm long. These embryos traverse capillary beds and circulate in the vascular system. There, the microfilariae are ingested by mosquitoes and continue their life cycle through L3 in the mosquito vector until infection of the host subsequent to the mosquito bite.As heartworm infection is a recognized problem in dogs, various attempts have been made to prevent or treat this condition. While there have been a number of attempts to prepare vaccines against heartworm infection in dogs, it is clear that this is not a straightforward matter and that the success of a particular

 Claims
1. A method to protect susceptible hosts against infection by nonadapted nematode parasites, which method comprises subjecting said host to a protocol which results in stimulation of the immune system of the host to elevated levels.
2. The method of claim 1 wherein said susceptible host is a feline and said parasite is D. immitis.
3. The method of claims 1-2 wherein said protocol comprises administering to said host a protective amount of at least one antigen derived from an adult or larval stage of a nematode.
4. The method of claim 3 wherein the nematode is selected from the group consisting of D. immitis, C. elegans, Onchocerqa cervipedis, O. cervicalis, BrÎ±gia malayi, Trichostrongylus , Haemonchus, Ostertagia, Nematodirus, Parascaris equorum, Ascaris s um, Toxascaris leonina, Toxocara canis, Toxocara cati, Ancylostoma, Uncinaria, and Strongyloides .
5. The method of claims 1-2 wherein said protocol comprises administering to said host an effective amount of at least one cytokine.
6. A vaccine composition useful in the method of claim 1, which vaccine comprises at least one antigen derived from said nonadapted nematode or a nematode related thereto, said antigen not protective against infection by 


said nematode parasite in normal hosts, in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient.
7. The vaccine of claim 6 wherein the nonadapted nematode is D. , immitis and the related nematode is C. elegans, Onchocerca cervipedis, O. cervicalis , Brugia malayi, Trichostrongylus, Haemonchus, Ostertagia, Nematodirus, Parascaris equorum, Ascaris suum, Toxascaris leonina, Toxocara canis, Toxocara cati , Ancylostoma, Uncinaria, or Strongyloides .
