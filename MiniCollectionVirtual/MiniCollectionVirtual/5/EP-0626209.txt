<ABSTRACT>
An improved power supply (5) for an electrostatic 
spray gun having a voltage multiplier circuit (12). The 

power supply (5) also comprises a voltage limiting circuit 
(60) coupled to the output of the multiplier circuit (12) 

which regulates the output voltage level of the multiplier 
circuit (12) so that when the output load current 

increases above a predetermined maximum level the output 
voltage is reduced to reduce the high voltage stress on 

the multiplier circuit (12) and high voltage circuitry and 
reduce the amount of insulation that must surround the 

multiplier circuit (12) and high voltage circuitry of the 
power supply (5) in order to insulate it from ground 

potential.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to high voltage 
power supplies used in electrostatic spray guns. This 
application is related to our co-pending European Patent 
Application, No. 94302207.9. Electrostatic spray guns are used for various 
applications to spray liquid and powder coatings onto 
various moving or stationary objects and parts. 
Generally, the coating is atomized and emitted as a mist 
from the end of the gun having a high voltage electrode. 
The electrode creates an electric field and an ion flux 
through which the sprayed particles pass, and the ion 
bombardment electrostatically charges the atomized coating 
particles passing through the ion-rich electric field. 
The electrostatically charged coating particles are then 
directed towards the object being sprayed, which is 
typically electrically grounded, so that the charged 
particles emitted from the end of the gun are attracted to 
the object to provide better adherence and coverage of the 
object with coating material. "Spray gun" as used herein 
includes any electrostatic spray device, whether or not 
hand-held, and whether or not configured in the shape of 
a pistol. Many hand-held electrostatic spray guns utilize an  
 
internal high voltage power supply to charge the 
electrode. These spray guns have a low level voltage 
input, for example from 12 to 30 volts DC, which is 
boosted by the internal power supply of the gun to a level 
that is desirable for the charging electrode, usually 50 
kilovolt (KV) or more. A low voltage level input allows 
the input power line to the gun to be smaller and more 
flexible, and hence more maneuverable, because it is not 
necessary to insulate the line to handle high voltage 
levels. The internal power supply has a voltage multiplier 
section or circuit that increases the low level supply 
voltage to a voltage level that is sufficiently high to 
electrostatically charge the spray particles. The 
multiplier circuit generally operates according to a 
characteristic power loadline which relates a) the output 
or load current delivered to the electrode, i.e., the 
amount of current, in microamperes (ÂµA), drawn to charge 
the spray particles, to b) the output voltage at the 
charging electrode. The characteristic power loadline of a spray gun 
multiplier circuit determines the quantity and 
distribution of charge delivered to the spray particles, 
and thus controls the quality of the coating on the object 
being sprayed. Typically, the characteristic power 
loadline of the gun multiplier circuit is
