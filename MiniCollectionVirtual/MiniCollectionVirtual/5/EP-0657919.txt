<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a device for handling wafers
with every group of more than one that may be built in a
cassette-less automatic wafer cleaning apparatus which does
not require very high accuracy in positioning the wafers and
may accommodate the wafers of different diameters.In semiconductor device fabrication, semiconductor
devices as final product is adversely affected in
performance thereof by impurities or foreign matter stuck on
the surface of a wafer made of semiconductor single crystal
( hereinafter referred to as wafer ), which is a starting
material for the devices.A cleaning operation is therefore indispensable in
processes for producing wafers. And there are available a 
variety of cleaning methods in the cleaning operation for a
process for producing wafers, which are most broadly
classified into the two group of physical methods and
chemical methods.In the physical methods, included are a method in which
impurities stuck on the surface of a wafer are directly
removed by the mechanical action of a washing brush, another
method in which a pressurized liquid is shot in a stream
onto part or all of the surface of a wafer from a jet nozzle
and thereby the impurities are removed off, and still
another method in which impurities stuck on the surface of a
wafer are removed off by application of ultrasonic waves (
which is the so-called ultrasonic cleaning method ).In the chemical methods, included are methods in which
impurities stuck on the surface of a wafer are chemically
decomposed into constituents to be removed by the powers of
chemicals or enzymes. In the meantime, both of the methods
may be combined so as to improve the total cleaning
capacity.A trend of increasingly more complexity of a
semiconductor device in recent years demands wafers as 
starting material of an increasingly larger diameter in
semiconductor device fabrication, so that laborious work
should be required in a cleaning operation if a conventional
method was adopted in which wafers are contained in a
plastic cassette as carrier and washed as they are kept
therein.What's more, another problem is brought about that
undesirable particles would be stuck onto wafers to pollute
due to collision or friction between the wafers and the
cassette, which produces the particles in a transportation
system where the wafers are contained within the cassette.The present applicant has proposed a single-wafer type
cassette-less automatic wafer cleaning apparatus, which is
disclosed in JP-A-5-36667, wherein
wafers are dealt with one at a

the external hollow shaft (23), said first telescopic shaft supported at one end by a base member (21) into which one end of each of said external and internal shafts extend;
handling means comprising a first handling member
(27) fixedly connected to said external hollow shaft

(23) adjacent the other end thereof opposite said one end extending into said base member and a second handling
member (28) fixedly connected to said internal shaft

(24) adjacent the other end thereof opposite said one end extending into said base member which extends
outwardly from said other end of said external hollow

shaft (23);
said handling members (27,28) each being provided
with wafer engaging means (31) for engaging the

peripheral edge of a wafer, the wafer engaging means
(31) of the first handling member (27) facing and being

aligned with the wafer engaging means (31) of the
second wafer handling member (28) whereby, in use of

the device, a wafer may be supported by its edge
between the wafer handling members (27,28); and
a drive mechanism for moving the external hollow
shaft (23) and the internal shaft (24) in

respective opposed directions;

   
characterised in that:
the device includes a second telescopic shaft supported at one end thereof by said base member,
also comprising an external hollow shaft (23) supported

horizontally and freely movable in the axial direction
and an internal shaft (24) inserted and freely slidable

within the inside of the external hollow shaft (23) one end of each of said internal and external shafts extending into said base member,
said first and second telescopic shafts together

comprising a pair of said telescopic shafts arranged
substantially parallel to one another;
said first handling member (27) being fixedly 
connected to each of said external hollow shafts (23)

adjacent the other ends thereof and said second
handling member (28) being fixedly connected to each of

said internal shafts (24) adjacent the other ends
thereof which extend outwardly from said other ends of

said external hollow shafts (23);

with a plurality of said wafer engaging means (31),

each of the wafer engaging means (31) of the first
handling member (27) facing and being aligned with a

corresponding wafer engaging means (31) of the second
wafer handling member (28) whereby, in use of the

device, a plurality of wafers may be supported by their
edges between the wafer handling members (27,28) in
