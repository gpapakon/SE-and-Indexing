<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a catalyst composition suitable 
for use, for example, in dehydrogenations. The present invention is directed to a novel catalyst composition and 
its use in the dehydrogenation of paraffins to olefins. The catalyst 
comprises an alloy of a Group VIII noble metal and a metal selected 
from the group consisting of zinc and gallium on a support selected 
from the group consisting of silica, zinc oxide modified silica and 
zinc oxide modified silica-pillared clays when said alloy is a zinc 
alloy, and silica, gallium oxide modified silica and gallium oxide 
modified silica-pillared clays when said alloy is a gallium alloy. 
The instant catalyst is an active and selective catalyst for the catalytic 
dehydrogenation of paraffins to olefins, especially gaseous paraffins, having 
the added benefit of retaining high activity and selectivity even following 
repeated regeneration by calcination in oxygen containing gas at temperatures 
of 450°C to 650°C, preferably 450°C to 500°C. The catalyst of the invention may be employed in the dehydrogenation of 
paraffins, especially gaseous paraffins, e.g., ethane, pentane, butane, 
isobutane, and isopentane, to their respective olefin derivatives. 
Preferably, mono-olefins will be produced. The catalyst can also be 
used for the hydrogenation of olefins to paraffins or the dehydrogenation 
of mono-olefins to di-olefins. The mono-olefins produced have high value as 
precursors to fuels, chemicals, and polymers. Due to equilibrium limitations, 
these selective paraffin dehydrogenations reactions are typically carried out 
at a high, but narrow temperature range, e.g., up to 650°C for isobutane  
 
dehydrogenation to isobutene, to maximize the olefin yield and minimize yields of 
undesired products such as alkynes, diolefins, and cracking products (lower 
molecular weight alkane olefin mixtures). Useful catalysts must exhibit high 
activity and selectivity for the desired dehydrogenation process and a minimal 
rate of deactivation. Furthermore, the coke formed in this high temperature 
process is very refractory and such coke formation may lead to deactivation. 
Complete coke removal can require combustion in O₂ containing gas a temperatures 
greater than ° C. Desirable catalysts, therefore, must retain high 
paraffin dehydrogenation activity following high temperature regeneration in 
O₂ containing streams. Applicants' catalyst additionally maintains its high activity and 
selectivity for extended periods of time (at least five days)
