<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a valve (A) intended to be mounted on a receiving unit (B) in order to limit the pressure of a fluid, including at least one cap piece (6), one end (7) of which is designed to be fixed to the unit and nearby bearing a diaphragm (membrane) (15) of a single piece with a valve shutter (16) interacting with a seat (5) produced in the unit, an operating knob (9) joined to the cap piece in the region of the opposite end (8) of the cap piece from the membrane, means (18, 21) for joining the valve shutter (16), the cap piece (6) and the knob (9), and an elastic calibration member (23). This modular precalibrated or calibratable valve includes an annular retaining member (17) fixed into the cap piece (6), and the perimeter of the diaphragm (15) is immobilised between a stop piece (14) formed in the cap piece and this retaining member; one of the joining means is a through-rod (18).

Diaphragm valve which is designed to be fitted
on a receiver block, in order to limit the pressure

of a fluid, of the type which comprises at least one
cap (6), one end (7) of which is suitable for being

secured to the block (B), and supports in the
vicinity of this end a flexible diaphragm (15),

which is integral with a shutter (16) designed to
co-operate with a seat (5) provided in the block, a

control button (9) which is connected to the cap in
the area of the end (8) of the latter which is

opposite the diaphragm, means (18, 21) for
assembling the shutter (16), the cap (6) and the

control button (9), and a resilient calibration unit
(23), the assembly means comprising an assembly rod

(18) which passes through the valve, from the
shutter (16) to the control button (9), both

inclusive, characterised in that it also comprises a
support ring (17) which is secured in the cap (6),

and the periphery of the diaphragm (15) is
immobilised between a stop (14) formed in the cap

and this support ring, and in that the assembly rod
(18) is provided, at its end which passes through

the shutter (16), with a head (20) which is
supported beneath this shutter, against the surface

of the latter which is opposite the control button
(9).
Valve according to claim 1, characterised in
that the support ring (17) is clipped into one end

of the cap (6).
Valve according to claim 1, characterised in
that it comprises a thermal thruster which is fitted

beneath the shutter (16), and is supported against
the end of the assembly rod (18) which passes

through this shutter. 
Valve according to claim 1, characterised in
that the cap (6) comprises a through-cavity (11), in

which there is accommodated a dish (22), which
contains the lower part of the resilient unit (23)

which is in the form of a helical spring, and vents
(12) which open into the cavity (11), through which

the helical spring can be seen.
Valve according to claim 1, characterised in
that the assembly means comprise the assembly rod

(18), and at least one ring (21) with claws, the
claws of which, which face the centre, are supported

against the assembly rod or the like.
Valve according to claim 1, characterised in
that the cap (6) is in a single piece, and contains

a central hole for passage of the assembly rod (18).
Valve according to claim 1, characterised in
that the cap (6) is in at least two coaxial pieces,

one (24) of which is displaceable inside the other,
and comprises a central hole for passage of the

assembly rod (18).
Valve according to claim 1, characterised in
that it comprises, disposed stacked, the assembly

rod (18) which is provided with the lower head (20),
the ring (17) to support the periphery of the

diaphragm (15), the shutter (16) and the diaphragm
(15) which are integral, a support dish (22) for a

calibration spring (23), a ring (21) with claws, the
calibration spring (23), the cap (6) to which there

is secured the periphery of the diaphragm (15),
which periphery is inserted between a stop (14)

formed in the cap (6) and the support ring (17),
optionally a calibration piece (24), the control 

button (9), another ring (21) with claws, and a
protective stopper (26).
Valve according to claim 1, characterised in
that it consists of modular components.
Valve according to claim 1, characterised in
that the assembly means comprise a dish (22) and the

assembly rod (18), the dish (22) containing the said
rod integrally and coaxially in its interior, and a

cavity which contains the resilient unit, which is
in the form of a helical spring, and which opposite

this cavity is supported against the shutter, a
rivet / stud which is accommodated in one end of the

rod and comprises the head (20) which maintains the
shutter against the dish, and, at the opposite end

of the rod, a slot which is provided in this rod in
order to provide it with resilience, and a clipping

projection which is supported against the control
button.
Valve according to claim 10, characterised in
that on one side of the dish, the rod passes through

the shutter, and on the other side it passes through
the cap and the control button.
Valve according to claim 10, characterised in
th
at the single piece which constitutes the dish and
the rod is made of synthetic material.
