<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of manufacturing a radiation-emitting 
semiconductor diode (10) whereby a sacrificial layer (1) comprising a polymer is 

provided on a first side face (11) of a semiconductor body (20) which contains at least 
one radiation-emitting semiconductor diode (10), a coating (2) is subsequently provided 

on the first side face (11) and on a second side face (12) of the semiconductor body (20) 
which encloses an angle with the first side face (11) and which forms an exit face for 

the radiation to be generated by the diode (10), after which the first side face (11) is 
divested of the sacrificial layer (1) and of the portion (21) of the coating (2) situated 

thereon through etching of the sacrificial layer (1). It is possible by such a method, for 
example, to cover the mirror faces (11, 14) of a laser diode (10) selectively with a 

reflecting, anti-reflection, or passivating coating (2). A disadvantage of the known 
method is that laser diodes (10) manufactured thereby are difficult to solder. 
According to the invention, this disadvantage is obviated in that a 
protective layer (3) comprising an inorganic material is provided on the sacrificial layer 

(1) before the provision of the coating (2) in the method. Such a protective layer (3) 
prevents damage to the sacrificial layer (1), and thus prevents portions of the coating 

(2), which cannot be removed anymore, from depositing on the first side face (11) 
which comprises, for example, a metal layer (7). Preferably, the protective layer (3) 

comprises a metal, for example aluminium. This also prevents the sacrificial layer (1) 
from becoming badly soluble owing to UV radiation released in a sputter deposition 

process of the coating (2). Remainders of the sacrificial layer (1) on the metal layer (7), 
which also result in bad soldering properties, are avoided thereby. (Laser) diodes thus 

manufactured have a long useful life and are highly suitable for high-power 
applications.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of manufacturing a radiation-emitting
semiconductor diode whereby a sacrificial layer comprising a polymer is provided on a
first side face of a semiconductor body which contains at least one radiation-emitting
semiconductor diode, a coating is subsequently provided on the first side face and on a
second side face of the semiconductor body which encloses an angle with the first side
face and which forms an exit face for the radiation to be generated by the diode, after
which the first side face is divested of the sacrificial layer and of the portion of the
coating situated thereon through etching of the sacrificial layer.A radiation-emitting semiconductor diode thus manufactured has an exit
face for radiation which is provided with a coating, such as a layer of high or low
reflectivity or a passivating layer, also called mirror coating in the case of a laser diode.
Such (laser) diodes are suitable for many applications such as CD (= Compact Disc),
DOR (= Digital Optical Recording), bar code readers and systems for glass fibre
communication.A method of the kind mentioned in the opening paragraph is known from
JP(A) 61-70780 published in Patent Abstracts of Japan, vol. 10, no. 240, 19th August
1986. According to the usual methods of providing a coating, such as sputtering, vapour
deposition and the like, the coating is provided also on surfaces other than the desired
surface of the semiconductor body. Thanks to the use of the sacrificial layer, which
comprises a polyimide resin in the known method, a surface of the semiconductor body
where no coating is desired, for example the upper surface, is freed from the portion of
the coating which has deposited on that surface.A disadvantage of the known method is that laser diodes manufactured
thereby have a starting current which is higher than expected or - in particular in the
case of high-power laser diodes - have a comparatively low maximum radiant power.The present invention has for its object inter alia to provide a method of
the kind mentioned in the opening paragraph whereby radiation-emitting semiconductor
diodes are obtained which have a low starting current and a high maximum radiant 
power.The invention is defined in claim 1.According to the invention, a method of the kind mentioned in the
opening paragraph is for this purpose characterized in that a protective layer of an
inorganic material is provided on the sacrificial layer before the coating is provided. A
sacrificial layer which comprises an organic polymer on
