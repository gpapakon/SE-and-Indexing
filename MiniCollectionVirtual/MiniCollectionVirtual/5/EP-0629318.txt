<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electrical power generators, 
particularly, but not exclusively, for providing electrical 
power for aircraft. It is known to produce an electrical current by causing 
relative movement of a magnet and coil. FR-2281273 discloses 
the use of the generated current to electrically heat propeller 
blades. A problem with such an arrangement is that a separate 
generator is required to provide power for other aircraft 
functions such as airframe de-icing. FR-A-1249849 discloses 
a generator having a magnet assembly and two winding 
assemblies. DE-A-2147527 discloses a generator having 
relatively rotatable winding assemblies. It is an object of the invention to provide an electrical power 
generator having at least two power outputs. Accordingly, the invention consists in an electrical generator 
comprising first and second relatively rotatable winding 
assemblies, the first winding assembly having a first 
electrical output for connection to a first electrical load and 
the  
 
second winding assembly having a second electrical 
output for connection to a second electrical load, 
and a permanent magnet assembly freely rotatably 
mounted between the winding assemblies such that, 
in use, relative motion of the winding assemblies 
induces a current in both winding assemblies. By making the magnet assembly freely rotatable it 
tends to follow one of the winding assemblies say 
the first, for example, inducing a current in the 
second assembly. The induced current produces a 
field which opposes the field producing it, 
causing a force which tends to rotate the magnet 
assembly in the opposite direction to that of the 
first winding assembly. This causes the magnet 
assembly to lag with respect to the first winding 
assembly and the relative motion therebetween 
causes a current to be induced in the first 
winding assembly. The use of such a generator is particularly 
advantageous in an aircraft where the second 
winding assembly may be fixed to the airframe and 
the first winding assembly fixed to a propeller  
 
hub. The magnet assembly is then freely rotatably mounted 
about the propeller shaft. With such an arrangement, blade 
heater elements may be connected to the first winding assembly 
and airframe de-icing elements to the second winding assembly. 
This is particularly advantageous since one generator can drive 
both de-icing elements. Whilst it may be possible on multi-engined aircraft for the 
second winding to be connected via slip-ring arrangements to 
the de-icing elements

<CLAIMS>
An electrical generator comprising relatively rotatable 
winding assemblies (5,8) and a permanent magnet assembly (12) 

characterised in that, a first winding assembly (5) has a 
first electrical output for connection to a first electrical 

load (4) and a second winding assembly (8) has a second 
electrical output for connection to a second electrical load 

(6,19), and a permanent magnet assembly (12) is freely 
rotatably mounted between the winding assemblies (5,8) such 

that, in use, rotation of the winding assemblies (5,8) relative 
to the permanent magnet assembly (12) induces a current in both 

winding assemblies. 
An electrical generator as claimed in claim 1 further

on the second member (9), and the permanent magnet assembly 

(12) mounted to be freely rotatable relative to the first and 
second members (3,9). 
A vehicle including an electrical generator as claimed 
in claim 2 further characterised in that the first member (3) 

is a propeller and the second member (9) is part of a vehicle 
body driven by rotation of the propeller in air, the first  

 
electrical load (4) comprising one or more elements associated 

with the propeller (3) to remove or inhibit the formation of 
ice on the propeller. 
A vehicle as claimed in claim 3 further characterised

succession. 
A vehicle as claimed in claim 3 or 4 further 
characterised in that the second electrical load (6) comprises 

one or more elements associated with the vehicle body to remove 
or inhibit the formation of ice on the body.

characterised in that it includes a third winding assembly (19) 

mounted on the second member (9) and connected to the second 
electrical output, and a fourth winding assembly (20) mounted 

on the first member (3) to rotate with the first winding 
assembly (5) and which is located adjacent to the third winding 

assembly (19) so that the latter induces a current in the 
fourth winding assembly (20), which current is delivered to a 

fourth electrical load (22,23) on the first member (3). 
A vehicle including an electrical generator as claimed  
 

in claim 6 further characterised in that the first member is 
a propeller (3) and the second member (9) is part of a vehicle 

body driven by rotation of the propeller in air, the first 
electrical load (4) comprising one or more elements associated 

with the propeller to remove or inhibit the formation of ice 
on the propeller. 
A vehicle as claimed in claim 7 further characterised

element (22,23) and each excited in succession by the third
