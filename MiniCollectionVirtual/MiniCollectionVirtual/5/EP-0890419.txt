<ABSTRACT>
A work stop (56) for use on a machine vise
(10) is received in a jaw plate (20,22) for such vise

(10) and is securely locked in position. The work
stop (56) is fixed in a groove (58) that is machined

int a top edge of the jaw plate (20,22) or jaw, with
a member (57) extending over the edge of the jaw

plate (20,22) and adjacent the face of the jaw plate
(20,22) that is used for clamping a workpiece. This

permits the workpiece to be slid against the stop
(56) before being clamped. The jaw plate (20,22) is

removable mounted onto a fixed jaw (18) and is
located precisely relative to the fixed jaw (18) so

that the jaw plate (20,22) with the work stop (56)
attached an be removed, and then replaced when the

same part is to be machined again.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a work stop that
can be positively positioned on a jaw plate of a vise using a
groove provided in the top edge of the vise. The work stop
has two parts that are expandable in dimension relative to the
side surfaces of the groove to positively clamp the work stop
in position. The jaw plate may be removable and includes
locators so it is precisely positioned in its location when it
is replaced.Work stops have long been used, particularly in
machining operations utilizing machine vises. Generally
speaking, these stops are clamp mounted at a specific spot on
the vise and then an adjustable rod that is held in the clamp
is used to provide the desired stop position. The clamps
generally are relatively cumbersome, and expensive if they are
going to be much good.There have been work stops developed which utilize
dove tail slots on a fixed member, and then a mating dove tail
block slides in the slot and supports a stop member for
forming a work stop. One such device is shown in US-A
5018562. However, with dove tail slots the mating pieces must
seat closely for securely latching the two components
together.Thus, the need exists for providing a small, low
cost, positive adjustable stop used in combination with a
removable jaw plate for increasing the convenience and the
speed of changing the work stop setting, and exchanging a
clamp jaw plate set up for one workpiece for another jaw plate
with a work stop for a different workpiece.The present invention relates to a work stop system
for use with machine vises. In particular, the work stop
system includes an easily adjustable, small, low profile stop 
member that slides along a groove or slot in the top edge of a
jaw plate of a vise and which can be positively locked in
position. The locking requires very little movement of the
locking members.The present invention also presents a jaw plate that
is used with a parallel sided slot or groove in a top edge
that extends in direction along the length of the jaw plate,
which direction is transverse to the clamping direction of a
vise. The work stop has a body with a first lock portion that
fits into the groove in the jaw plate, and a second lock
portion also that fits into the groove and mates with the
first lock portion so that upon tightening a screw or turning
a cam the lock portions expand and the work stop is positively
locked against the parallel side surfaces of the groove or
slot.Various forms of locks are shown, including a wedge
type lock where a movable wedge portion slides on a

<CLAIMS>
A clamping device having a jaw member
adapted to hold a workpiece in the clamping device,

the jaw member having an edge surface transverse to a
clamping surface, a groove formed in said edge

surface and having spaced side surfaces, and a work
stop for locating a workpiece at a desired location

relative to the jaw comprising a body member having a
lock portion adapted to fit within the groove between

the side surfaces in a first position, and the lock
member in a second position expanding to engage both

of the side surfaces of the groove to securely hold
the work stop body member at a desired location along

the groove.
The clamping device of claim 1, wherein the
work stop body member rests on the edge surface of

the jaw member in which the groove is formed.
The clamping device of claim 2, wherein the
body member has a portion that extends beyond the

clamping face of the jaw.
The clamping device of any one of claims 1
to 3, wherein the lock portion comprises a wedge

locking device having a movable wedge portion that
engages one side surface of the groove and forces a

second wedge portion of the lock member against the
other side surface when the first movable wedge

portion is actuated.
The clamping device of any one of claims 1
to 4, wherein said lock portion comprises a cam

mounted in said body member and having an eccentric
cam portion extending into said groove that engages a

surface of the groove and forces other surfaces of
the lock portion against an opposite surface of the

groove.
The clamping device of any one of claims 1
to 5, wherein said lock portion comprises a wedge

actuator inclined relative to a side surface of said
groove, said wedge actuator engaging one of the side

surfaces to urge other surfaces of the lock portion
against an opposite side surface of the groove.
A jaw plate for mounting onto a clamping
member comprising a generally flat plate having

peripheral edges surrounding ia clamping face and
including at least one substantially planar edge, a

groove formed in the planar edge and extending along
the planar edge, said groove having spaced side walls

and opening to the linear edge, said groove being
positioned substantially midway between oppositely

facing clamping surfaces of the jaw plate.
The jaw plate of claim 7, wherein said
plate has a rectangular periphery, and said groove is

formed on a long side of the rectangular periphery,
and a jaw plate locating receptacle opening to an

opposite longitudinal edge from the groove and
opening to a face of the jaw plate opposite the

clamping face, said locating receptacle extending
transversely to the jaw plate from the opposite edge.
The jaw plate of claim 8, wherein said
locating receptacles has substantially and parallel

side surfaces, for guiding the position of the jaw
plate relative to a locating pin.
The jaw plate of claim 9 in combination
with a jaw of a vise, said jaw of a vise having a

locating pin protruding from a mounting face thereof,
said locating pin being adapted to fit into the

locating receptacle when the jaw plate is moved
against a jaw face, said locating pin having a

resilient end portion that urges the pin tightly

against the parallel side surfaces of the locating
receptacle.
A work stop member comprising a body having
a stop portion adjacent one end thereof, said body

having a planar surface and a lock portion extending
from said planar surface for fitting into a groove

having spaced side walls, said lock portion including
a movable part capable of changing a dimension of the

lock portion such that the lock portion can be
inserted into a groove and the movable part can be

moved to clamp the lock portion relative to the side
surfaces of such groove.
The work stop of claim 11, wherein said
lock portion comprises a wedge lock member, and the
