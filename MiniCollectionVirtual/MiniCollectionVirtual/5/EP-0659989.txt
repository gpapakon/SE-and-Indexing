<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for feeding cooling fluid into a piston (11), with a tube (40), one end of which can be connected to a cooling-fluid feed passage (42) in a housing and the other end of which has a spray opening (43) for cooling the underside of the piston (11). According to the invention, at least one further spray opening (44) for lubricating drive components (19, 20, 25) serving for engine valve control (7) and/or fuel delivery (8) is provided.

Reciprocating piston internal combustion engine (1) with a cylinder head 
housing (2) having cylinder banks (3, 4) arranged in a V-shape, with a camshaft 

(6) situated in the area of the apex of the V-space for the control at least of the 
gas exchange valves (7), with engine components (19, 20, 25) that serve the 

fuel delivery system (8), and with a piston cooling device which comprises a 
tube (40) for each piston (11, 12), one end of the said tube being connected to 

a lubrication oil channel (42) in the cylinder head housing while the other end 
comprises an injection aperture (43) opposite the underside of the piston, and 

such that along its length the tube has a further injection aperture (44),
characterized in that
 
at least one further injection aperture (44) is provided for the lubrication of the 

gas exchange control system (7) and/or the engine components (19, 20, 25) 
that serve the fuel delivery system (8). 
Reciprocating piston internal combustion engine according to Claim 1,
characterized in that
 
a single injection aperture (44) intended for lubrication is provided, from which 

both the engine components for the gas exchange control system and those for 
the fuel delivery system are irrigated. 
Reciprocating piston internal combustion engine according to either of Claims 
1 or 2,
characterized in that
 
two injection apertures (44) intended for lubrication are provided, one of them 

serving to lubricate the engine components (25) provided for the gas exchange 
control system and the other to lubricate the engine components (19, 20) 

provided for the fuel delivery system. 
Reciprocating piston internal combustion engine according to any one or more 
of the preceding Claims,
characterized in that
 
at least one further injection aperture (44) is produced by drilling of the 

manufactured tube (40). 
Reciprocating piston internal combustion engine according to any one or more 
of the preceding Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that
 
the at least one further injection aperture (44) is also produced during the 

manufacture of the tube (40). 
Reciprocating piston internal combustion engine according to any one or more 
of the preceding Claims,
characterized in that
 
a nozzle is plugged or fitted into the injection aperture (43) provided for the 

cooling of the piston, and/or to the at least one injection aperture (44) provided 
for lubrication. 
Reciprocating piston internal combustion engine according to any one or more 
of the preceding Claims,
characterized in that
 
the injection aperture (43) provided for cooling the piston and/or the at least 

one injection aperture (44) provided for lubrication, is/are formed as a nozzle 
manufactured integrally with the tube (40). 
Reciprocating piston internal combustion engine according to any one or more 
of the preceding Claims,
characterized in that
 
in the area if its end near the cylinder head housing (54), the tube (40) is 

attached to a fixing plate (53) positioned transversely to the direction of the 
tube's length, such that for a first fixing, the tube projects through the fixing 

plate (53) by a detent length (55), and this excess length is inserted into a 
connection hole (56) branching off from the inlet channel (42), and that to  

 
further fix its position, a screw connection is used to attach the tube (40) to the 

cylinder housing (2) by means of a screw-bolt (57) and a threaded hole (59) in 
the cylinder housing (2).
