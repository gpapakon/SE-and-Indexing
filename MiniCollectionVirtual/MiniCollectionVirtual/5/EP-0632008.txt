<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is related to pentanoic acid derivatives. More
particularly, this invention is related to :
(1) pentanoic acid derivatives of the formula (I):

wherein all the symbols are the same meaning as hereafter defined, and
non-toxic salts thereof and acid addition salts thereof,(2) improving agent of the brain functions containing pentanoic acid
derivatives of the formula (I) and non-toxic salts thereof and acid addition
salts thereof as active ingredient,(3) process for the preparation of pentanoic acid derivatives of the
formula (I) and non-toxic salts thereof and acid addition salts thereof and(4) improving agent of the brain functions containing pentanoic acidderivatives of the formula (X):

wherein all the symbols are the same meaning as hereafter defined, and
non-toxic salts thereof and acid addition salts thereof as active ingredient.The two major structural units that form the brain are neuron and glia.
The neuron is composed of a cell body with dendrites. Ramified structures
that transmit neuro-information along an axon and those receiving impulses
via other neurons are the two types of dendrites known in existence. Neuro-information
is conducted from one neuron to another via transmission
across the synapse, a cleft that closely connects the dendrites of two
communicating neurons.However, glia is units that complement the functions of these neurons
by supplying nutrients, eliminating catabolites/wastes, maintaining a proper
ion equilibrium and performing other related functional roles for neurons to
physiologically function normally. The glia encompass various types of
cells. There are astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and microglia in the central
nervous system; Schwann's and mantle cells in the peripheral nervous
system; and ependymal cells in the ventricular endothelium.The growth and differentiation of neurons prevail immediately before
and after birth, whereas those of glia persist even after birth. The etiological
factors of neurodegenerative diseases (such as Alzheimer's disease,
multiple sclerosis, hepatic encephalopathy and delayed neuronal death)
have been thought to be attributed mainly to abnormalities in the neurons.
However, attention has recently been focused on the functional
abnormalities of glia surrounding the neurons, especially astrocytes
(Scientific American, pp45-52, April 1989). This is because astrocytes not
only act as complementary cells, but they also promote the metabolism of
glutamate and γ-amino butyrate (GABA), syntheses of neuropeptides and
cytokines, and
