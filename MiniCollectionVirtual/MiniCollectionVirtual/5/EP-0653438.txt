genes derived from viruses, (3) inhibit expression of genes 
producing proteins which contribute to the development of 

inflammations, (4) control expression of drug-resistant 
genes which cause complications in chemotherapy of 

malignant tumors, and (5) inhibit production of cell growth 
factors related to reangiostenosis after PCTA (percutaneous 

transluminal coronary angioplasty) by complementation to 
DNAs or mRNAs of genes inducing various diseases. They can 

be therefore used as antitumor agents, antiviral agents, 
antiinflammatory agents and drugs for controlling 

expression of specific genes such as resistance genes. 
These oligonucleotides can also be used as probes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to oligonucleotide 
compounds or salts thereof which have the capability to 
control activation or exression of specified genes; these 
compounds and salts thereof can (a) inhibit expression of 
genes associated with the development of malignant tumors 
in malignant tumor cells, (b) inhibit expression of viral 
genes derived from viruses in mammalian, (c) inhibit 
expression of genes encoding proteins that contribute to 
the development of inflammations, (d) inhibit expression of 
drug-resistant genes, thereby enhancing the chemotherapy 
treatment by reducing one of the problems often associated 
with chemotherapy, or (e) inhibit production of cell growth 
factors related to reangiostenosis after PTCA (percutaneous 
transluminal coronary angioplasty); the production of the 
oligonucleotide compounds or salts thereof. These 
compounds and salts thereof can be used in in vitro drug 
screening assays to screen for a variety of compounds; they 
also are useful in compositions containing the 
oligonucleotide compounds or the salt thereof which inhibit 
expression of specified genes such as genes contributing to 
the development of malignant tumors, viral diseases or 
inflammations. These compounds can also be used as probes 
in screening assays. Many diseases are known to be associated with gene 
products produced as a result of expression of specific 
genes. Examples thereof include the followings:
 
Viral genes or tumor associated genes such as oncogenes. 
These pathogenic genes can be roughly divided into two 
kinds, genes existing in cells (e.g. conversion of a protooncogene 
to an oncogene) and genes called extraneous genes 
resulting from infection with extracellular viruses. 
Recent investigation has revealed that expression of these 
genes is one factor associated with the development of 
viral diseases or in the development of abnormal growth of 
normal cells. Further, adhesive proteins produced by 
certain genes such as ICAM-1 contribute to the development 
of inflammations by expression of the genes such as ICAM-1. 
Furthermore, although expression of drug-resistant genes is 
not directly the cause of disease, their expression can be 
considered to be the indirect cause thereof or can be 
considered an agent in incresing the severity of such 
diseases, because organisms that acquire drug resistance 
against antitumor agents on chemotherapy (e.g. for 
malignant tumors), cause difficulty in obtaining a complete 
cure. Accordingly, drugs which control activation or

by Y is galactose, mannose or glucose of which an alcoholic 
hydroxyl group may be substituted by C₁₋₅ alkylcarbonyl. 
A saccharide derivative represented by the 
following formula: 


 
wherein Y represents a saccharide residue and R¹⁰ 

represents hydrogen or a benzyl group. 
A use of the oligonucleotide compound or the salt 
thereof claimed in claim 1 for manufacturing a composition 

for inhibiting a gene expression. 
The use of the oligonucleotide compound or the 
salt thereof as claimed in claim 100, which is a 

composition for inhibiting expression of a gene 
contributing to the development of a malignant tumor, a 

virus disease or an inflammation. 
The use of the oligonucleotide compound or the 
salt thereof as claimed in claim 100, in which inhibition 

of the gene expression is (1) inhibition of transcription 
from DNA to pre mRNA, (2) inhibition of splicing from pre 

mRNA to mature mRNA, or (3) inhibition of translation from 
mature mRNA to a protein. 
The use of the oligonucleotide compound or the 
salt thereof as claimed in claim 101, in which the gene 

contributing to the development of the malignant tumor is a 
gene selected from the group consisting of src, fps, yes, 

ros, myb, myc, erb, rel, mos, abl, ras, fos, fes, fms, sis, 
raf, neu and p53, the gene contributing to the development 

of the virus disease is a gene selected from the group 
 

consisting of HIV, an influenza virus, a herpes virus, a 
papilloma virus, a poliovirus, a picornavirus and an 

adenovirus, and the gene contributing to the development of 
the inflammation is a gene selected from the group 

consisting of ICAM-1, ELAM-1 and VLAM. 
The use of the oligonucleotide compound or the 
salt thereof as claimed in claim 100, in which the gene is 

ICAM-1. 
A use of the oligonucleotide compound or the salt 
thereof as claimed in any one of claim 1 to 75 for 

manufacturing a composition for inhibiting a reangiogenesis 
after PTCA (percutaneous transluminal coronary 

angioplasty). 
A use of the saccharide derivative as claimed in 
claim 85 for manufacturing the oligonucleotide compounds or 

the salts thereof as claimed in claim 2. 
A use of the saccharide derivative as claimed in 
claim 87 for manufacturing the oligonucleotide compounds or 

the salts thereof as claimed in claim 2. 
A use of the saccharide derivative as claimed in 
claim 93 for manufacturing the oligonucleotide compounds or 

the salts thereof as claimed in claim 38. 
A use of the saccharide derivative as claimed in 
claim 99 for manufacturing the saccharide derivative or the 

salts thereof wherein Q represents a formula 
 

as claimed in claim 82.
