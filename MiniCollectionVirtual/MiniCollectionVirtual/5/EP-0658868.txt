<ABSTRACT>
A method and device for controlling the bias voltages for a split-reset 
spatial light modulator. Each block of the spatial light modulator can be 

individually controlled lowering the throughput needed to load each frame of 
data. Blocks are selected individually or in groups with the potential of 

providing one voltage condition on the selected blocks and a different voltage 
condition on the deselected blocks. One embodiment of the disclosed method 

comprises input latches and buffers 44, address decode logic 46 to determine 
the selected blocks, mode select logic 48 to determine the requested 

operation, delay circuitry 50 to minimize current loading, and level shifters 
52 to convert logic signals to voltage levels appropriate to control the output 

drive circuitry 54.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of spatial light modulators,
especially those known as digital micromirror devices, and more particularly
to circuitry for controlling spatial light modulators as defined in the
precharacterizing portion of claim 6. The invention further relates to
a method as defined in the precharacterizing portion of claim 1.Spatial light modulators (SLMs) typically consist of an array of
electronically addressable pixel elements and related control circuitry. A
frequently used type of SLM is the digital micromirror device (DMD), in
which each pixel element is a tiny micro-mechanical mirror, capable of
independent movement in response to an electrical input. Incident light is
modulated by reflection from each pixel. A typical application is for image
display, where light from each pixel is magnified and projected to a display
screen by an optical system.DMDs can be fabricated in many different forms including the
cantilever beam, hinge, and torsion beam embodiments. While the disclosed
invention is equally applicable to all forms of DMDs, specific examples will
reference the torsion beam digital micromirror as disclosed in U.S. Patent
No. 5,061,049, entitled "Spatial Light Modulator and Method" assigned to the
same assignee as the present application.For many applications, the SLM is binary in the sense that each pixel
element may have either of two states. The element may be off, which means
that it delivers no light. Or, the element may be on, which means that it
delivers light at a maximum intensity. To achieve a viewer perception of 
intermediate levels of light, various pulse width modulation techniques may
be used. Some of these techniques are described in pending U.S. Patent
Serial No. 07/678,761, entitled "DMD Architecture and Timing for Use in a
Pulse-Width Modulated Display System" assigned to the same assignee as
the present application, also published as EP-A-0 507 270.In general, pulse width modulation produces an integrated brightness
by switching each pixel on or off during each frame for a period that
corresponds to a binary number. Pulse width modulation typically uses as
"bit-frame" loading, in which data for every pixel in a frame is loaded into a
memory cell associated with each pixel. One bit of data is loaded into each
memory cell in the array and then all pixel elements are set to correspond to
that bit-frame of data. During the display time of the current bit-frame, data
for the next bit-frame is loaded. According to one pulse width modulation
method, the
