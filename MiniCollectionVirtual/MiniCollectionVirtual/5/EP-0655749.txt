<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for producing a
composite comprising a paper and an electroconducting polymer
having a grown conjugated system at the main chain thereof.
More specifically, the invention relates to a process for
producing a composite comprising a paper and a conjugated
electroconducting polymer having improved fabrication and
stability without impairing inherent characteristics of the
conjugated electroconducting polymer and the composite
comprising a paper and a conjugated electroconducting polymer
being obtainable by said process.An electroconducting polymer having a highly grown
conjugated system at the main chain thereof causes insulatormetal
transition by doping with a dopant which is an electron
donor or an electron acceptor, whereby the conductivity thereof
can be desirably controlled. Furthermore, with the transition,
optical and magnetic properties of the compound are largely
changed. Accordingly, such an electroconducting polymer has
been widely noticed as a functional material capable of making
various functional applications by utilizing the above-described
properties.Recently, with the development of various kinds of
electroconducting polymers, utilization of the conjugated
electroconducting polymer to electrodes for batteries, electrochemical 
sensors, electrochromic devices, etc., has been highly
expected.Since conventional conjugated electroconducting
polymers are generally insoluble in almost all of solvents and
are not melted even by heating, the polymers had a large
disadvantage of poor fabrication. Recently, electroconducting
polymers soluble in solvents and fusible electroconducting
polymers capable of undergoing melt molding by heating have
been developed. However, it is the present status that these
conjugated electroconducting polymers have not yet had
sufficient fabrication, or if these polymers are given
sufficient fabrication, the inherent characteristics of these
compounds are impaired.Also, when a precursor polymer of a conjugated electroconducting
polymer is cast and heat treated, a conjugated
electroconducting polymer may be obtained in a film form.
However, in almost all cases, it was impossible to obtain a
film having sufficient flexibility. Bjorklund, R.B. and
Lundstr√∂m, I. reported about a process for impregnating a
porous material, such as a paper (Journal of Electronic
Materials, Vol.13, No. 1, 1984). The process for the
impregnation comprises the soaking of the porous material in a
solution of a metal salt like FeCl3/H2O which acts as the
