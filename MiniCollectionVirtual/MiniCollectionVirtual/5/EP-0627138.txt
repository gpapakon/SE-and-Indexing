<ABSTRACT>
In a demodulator for radio data signals which are transmitted by phase keying a suppressed auxiliary carrier, the occurrence of transient times is prevented by converting the received auxiliary carrier-frequency signal into a first square-wave signal (A) and forming a second auxiliary carrier-frequency signal which is taken into such a time relationship to the first square-wave signal that a comparison between the two square-wave signals provides phase information on the first (A). The demodulator may be made solely of digital components.
