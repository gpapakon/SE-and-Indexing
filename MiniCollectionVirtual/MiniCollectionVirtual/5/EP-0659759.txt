<ABSTRACT>
A novel physiologically active substance, NK175203, is obtained from the medium of incubation of an NK175203-producing 
bacterium belonging to the genus 
Streptomyces
. It is useful as the active ingredient of a pharmaceutical composition for promoting

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel
physiologically active substance, NK175203, or a
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. More
particularly, the present invention relates to a novel
physiologically active substance NK175203 having an
activity for promoting proliferation of bone marrow
cells, or a salt thereof; a process for production
thereof and a pharmaceutical use thereof.As bone marrow cell growth enhancers, there
are known erythropoietin (Miyake, T. et al., J.B.C.,
252, 5558, 1977) and G-CSF (Nicola, N.A., Annu. Rev.
Biochem., 339, 27-30, 1989). However, these enhancers
are protein preparations and thus unsuitable for
frequent administrations. Therefore, it has been
desired to find a low molecular weight compound having
an activity comparable to these substances.The present inventors have made various
investigations on metabolites of microorganisms. As a
result, it has been discovered that one strain belonging 
to the genus Streptomyces produces a physiologically
active substance NK175203 having an activity of
promoting proliferation of bone marrow cells.That is, an object of the present invention is
to provide a novel physiologically active substance,
NK175203, having physico-chemical properties 1) through
10) described below, or a pharmaceutically acceptable
salt thereof.
