A gear pump with at least one shaft seal (5a,
7a) which acts between a rotor shaft (5) and stator (3)

against axial passing of material to be conveyed, and which

has axially extended sealing surfaces placed on the stator
side (7a) and on the shaft side (5a) and facing each other,

whereby the sealing surfaces (5a, 7a) facing each other have
at least in one surface portion (5a, 7a) a radial orientation

component, and the shaft region with portion (5a) and the
housing region with portion (7a) are axially movable (v)

relative to each other, characterized in that the shaft seal
is in contact with the material to be conveyed and the

axially extended sealing surfaces are axially movable
relative to each other by means of the sealing elements that

support them, such that for different materials to be
conveyed in the pump, sealing gap (9) is adjustable along

sealing surfaces (5a, 7a).
A gear pump with at least one shaft which is
mounted at least on one side on a slide bearing and

lubricated inside or outside by the material to be conveyed,
and which comprises a bearing surface placed on the stator

side (7a) and a bearing surface placed on the shaft side
(5a), characterized in that said bearing surfaces placed on

the stator side and on the shaft side (7a, 5a) are truncated
and the bearing clearance is adjustable by means of axial

relative displacement (v) of bearing surfaces (5a, 7a), such
that for different materials to be conveyed in the pump,

bearing clearance (9) is adjustable along bearing surfaces
(5a, 7a).
The gear pump according to claim 1,
characterized in that the shaft is mounted at least on one

side on a slide bearing and lubricated inside or outside by
the material to be conveyed and there are provided to that

end a bearing surface placed on the shaft side (5a) and a
bearing surface placed on the stator side (7a), and in that

said bearing surfaces placed on the stator side and on the
shaft side are truncated and are axially movable relative to

each other such that bearing clearance (9) between said 
bearing surfaces (7a, 5a) is adjustable and said gear pump

can be used to convey different materials.
The gear pump according to claim 3,
characterized in that the relative displacement of sealing

surfaces (5a, 7a) is at the same time the relative
displacement of bearing surfaces (5a, 7a).
The gear pump according to any of claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that seal (5a, 7a) or slide bearing (5a, 7a)

is connected on one side to the surrounding atmosphere.
The gear pump according to claim 1 or 5,
characterized in that the seal acts on one side against a

rolling bearing for the shaft.
The gear pump according to any of claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that a shaft region provided with the

sealing surface placed on the shaft side (5a) and/or with the
bearing surface placed on the shaft side (5a) is axially

movable relative to the gears (1) of the pump.
The gear pump according to any of claims 1 to 7,
characterized in that a stator region (3") provided with the

sealing surface placed on the stator side (7a) and/or with
the bearing surface placed on the stator side (7a) is axially

movable relative to a gear pump housing.
The gear pump according to any of claims 1 to 8,
characterized in that between parts that are axially movable

relative to each other, on the shaft and the stator with the
respective bearing and/or sealing surfaces, there are

provided adjusting members for the mutual position.
The gear pump according to any of claims 1, 3 to
9, characterized in that there is provided a sensing device

which delivers a signal (m ˙) that is univocally assigned to
the quantity of product flowing through seal (54), said

signal is compared to a theoretical value signal (W
2
) and the
quantity coming out is regulated by acting upon an adjusting

element (60) for the relative axial position of the sealing
surfaces.
The gear pump according to any of claims 1 to
10, characterized in that there are provided a bearing 

temperature measuring device (ϑ) and/or a measuring device
for differential pressure (Δp) over the pump, and in that

depending on the measuring signal or signals an adjusting
device (58, 60) is operated for the relative axial position

of the regions.
The gear pump according to any of claims 1, 3 to
11, characterized in that there is provided an adjusting

member (45, 43) which axially widens the sealing surface by
a predetermined value in order to free the seal for rinsing.
A method for rinsing the seal in a gear pump
according to any of claims 1, 3 to 12, characterized in that

sealing surfaces (35a, 37a) are moved away from each other by
means of the axial displacement such that a product which is

prevented by the seal from passing through flows between
sealing surfaces (35a, 37a) with a predetermined rinsing

flow.
