<ABSTRACT>
A process for preparing a polyarylene sulfide 
involves contacting a sulfur source with a metallic salt 

of ω -hydroxycarboxylic acid and a dihalogen aromatic 
compound in an organic polar solvent, thereby carrying 

out polycondensation with stability in a polymerization 
system in which a water content is large. The polyarylene 

sulfide prepared has a high degree of whiteness and with a 
sufficiently high molecular weight. 
The use of the metallic salt of ω -hydroxycarboxylic 
acid in a particular range can provide a novel polyarylene 

sulfide.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
preparing a polyarylene sulfide More particularly, the present invention relates to 
a process for preparing a polyarylene sulfide, in which 
a hydrous alkali metal sulfide commercially available 
is used without dehydration and a polymerization promoter 
can be recovered with ease. The polyarylene sulfide is 
high in a degree of whiteness and a molecular weight of 
the polyarylene sulfide is sufficiently high, and it is 
suitable for molding materials for various molded 
articles, films, fibers, and mechanical, electric and 
electronic parts. The present invention can prevent a color from 
being imparted by by-products and the like to the 
polyarylene sulfide containing a carbonyl group while 
permitting a high recovery rate of an organic polar 
solvent, a polyarylene sulfide being different in solubility 
from usual polyarylene sulfides. The process can allow 
an efficient production of the polyarylene sulfide with a 
high degree of whiteness in high yields. Furthermore, according to the present invention a 
polyarylene sulfide can be prepared under specified 
production condition, which is high in a degree of 
whiteness and has a resistance to heat as high as the  
 
usual polyarylene sulfides. The polyarylene sulfides such as polyphenylene 
sulfide are thermoplastic while being partially thermosetting, 
and they have superior properties as engineering 
plastics, such as excellent resistance to chemicals, 
favorable mechanical strength over a broad temperature 
range, and good thermal rigidity. The polyarylene sulfides such as polyphenylene 
sulfide have been heretofore prepared by various processes. U. S. Patent No. 3,354,129 proposes a process for 
preparing polyarylene sulfides in which a polyhalogen 
aromatic compound such as a dihalogen aromatic compound 
is reacted with an alkali metal sulfide in an organic 
polar solvent. U. S. Patent No. 3,919,177 and Japanese Patent 
Publication (Kokoku) No. 12,240/1977 propose processes 
for preparing polyarylene sulfides having a high intrinsic 
viscosity and low melt flowability, in which a p-dihalobenzene 
is polymerized with an alkali metal sulfide or an 
alkali metal bisulfide (an alkali metal hydrosulfide, or 
an alkali metal hydrogen sulfide) as a sulfur source or 
another appropriate sulfur compound (for example, 
thiourea, thioamide, thiocarbamate, thiocarbonate, 
mercaptan, mercaptide, mercaptocarboxylic acid, or the 
like) to be used with at least one member of a base, in 
the presence of a promoter
