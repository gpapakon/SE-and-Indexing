<DESCRIPTION>
This is a continuation-in-part of application USSN 06/368773,
filed April 15, 1982.The present invention relates to human urokinase, to novel forms
and compositions thereof and particularly to means and methods for
the preparation invitro of functional protein species of human
urokinase.The present invention is based in part on the discovery of the
DNA sequence and deduced amino acid sequence of native urokinase as
well as associated portions of the urokinase molecule found to be
the functional bioactive moieties. This discovery enabled the
production of urokinase in various forms via the application of
recombinant DNA technology, in turn enabling the production of
sufficient quality and quantity of materials with which to conduct
requisite biological testing identifying the biologically
functional, hence useful moieties of the molecule. Having
determined such, it was possible to tailor-make functional species
of urokinase via genetic manipulation and invitro processing,
arriving efficiently at hitherto unobtainable commercially
efficacious amounts of active products. This invention is directed
to these associated embodiments in all respects. The publications and other materials hereof used to illuminate
the background of the invention, and in particular cases, to provide
additional details concerning its practice are incorporated herein
by reference, and for convenience, are numerically referenced in the
following text and respectively grouped in the appended bibliography.The fibrinolytic system is in a dynamic equilibrium with the
coagulation system, maintaining an intact, patent vascular bed. The
coagulation system deposits fibrin as a matrix serving to restore a
hemostatic condition. The fibrinolytic system removes the fibrin
network after the hemostatic condition is achieved. The
fibrinolytic process is brought about by the proteolytic enzyme
plasmin that is generated from a plasma protein precursor
plasminogen. Plasminogen is converted to plasmin through activation
by an activator.Urokinase is one such activator. It and another activator,
streptokinase, are currently commercially available. Both are
indicated for the treatment of acute vascular diseases such as
myocardial infarct, stroke, pulmonary embolism, deep vein
thrombosis, peripheral arterial occlusion and other venous
thromboses. Collectively, these diseases account for major health
hazards and risks.The underlying etiological basis for these diseases points to
either a partial, or in severe cases, total occlusion of a blood
vessel by a

<CLAIMS>
A process for producing an expression vehicle which comprises operably
linking a first DNA sequence to a second DNA sequence capable of effecting expression of

said first DNA sequence in a selected host cell capable of producing glycoproteins wherein
said first DNA sequence encodes a polypeptide having an intact lysine - isoleucine bond at

the position corresponding to amino acids 158 - 159 in the native prourokinase molecule,
having sufficient of the amino acid sequence set out in Figures 4A and 4B such that, on

activation, the activated glycosylated polypeptide exhibits the enzymatic activity of human
urokinase, and optionally having an amino acid or an amino acid sequence preceding the N-terminus

of the ordinarily first amino acid of said polypeptide.
A process according to claim 1 wherein a methionine residue precedes the
N-terminus.
A process according to claim 1 or 2 wherein the polypeptide is one having
glycosylation different from that of native urokinase.
A process according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the
polypeptide expressed is one having the sequence Lys-Ile-Ile-Gly-Gly, at positions

corresponding to amino acids 158-162 in the native prourokinase molecule.
A process according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the
expressed polypeptide is one having the amino acid sequence or substantially the amino acid

sequence as depicted in Figs 4A and 4B.
A process to any one of claims 1 to 4 wherein the polypeptide is one having
the amino acid sequence as depicted in Figs 2A and B and derivatives of said amino acid

sequence which still comprises the enzymatic portion of human urokinase.
A process according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the resulting
expression vehicle is capable, in a transformant microorganism or cell culture, of expressing

the first DNA sequence in a selected host cell. 
A process for producing a microorganism or cell culture capable of
expressing a selected polypeptide which comprises transforming a microorganism or

vertebrate cell with an expression vehicle produced by a process according to any one of the
preceding claims.
A process according to claim 8 wherein the microorganism is a yeast or a
vertebrate cell and a glycosylated polypeptide is obtained. 
A plasmid selected from the group consisting of pUK33trpLEL,
pUK33trpLEs, pUK33trp103, pUK54trp207-1 and ppreUK54trp207-1, wherein said

plasmids are as producible according to the construction schemes set out in Figs. 5, 6,
7, 9 and 10, respectively.
A yeast or a vertebrate cell transformed with any one of the plasmids
according to claim 10.
A process for producing a glycosylated polypeptide comprising the
step of culturing a microorganism or cell culture produced by a process according to

claim 8 or claim 9 under conditions such that the polypeptide is expressed, and
optionally recovering the glycosylated polypeptide from the culture medium.
