<ABSTRACT>
A chip carrier (10) is disclosed which includes a chip carrier 
substrate (20) and at least one semiconductor chip (50) mounted in a 

flip chip configuration, via solder balls (70), on a circuitized 
surface (30) of the chip carrier substrate (20). The 

solder balls (60) are 
encapsulated in a first encapsulant (70) having a composition 

which includes an epoxy. In addition, at least a portion of 
the circuitry (30) on the circuitized surface is encapsulated in 

a second encapsulant (110) having a composition which includes a 
urethane, and which composition is chosen so that the 

second encapsulant (110) exhibits a modulus of elasticity which 
is equal to or less than about 10,000 psi. As a 

consequence, the second encapsulant (110) exhibits neither 
internal cracks, nor interfacial cracks at the interface 

with the first encapsulant (70), nor does 
the second encapsulant (110) 

delaminate from the circuitized surface, when the chip 
carrier (10) is thermally cycled.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention pertains generally to chip carriers, and more
particularly to a chip carrier having a circuitized surface
which is at least partially covered by a protective,
ultraviolet (UV) radiation cured coating.One type of semiconductor chip package includes one or more
semiconductor chips mounted on a circuitized surface of a
substrate, e.g., a ceramic substrate or a plastic
substrate. Such a semiconductor chip package,
conventionally termed a chip carrier, is usually intended
for mounting on a printed circuit card or printed circuit
board. If, for example, surface mounting is to be used,
then the chip carrier will conventionally include a lead
frame or edge clip which is mechanically and electrically
connected to electrical contact pads formed around the
periphery of the chip-bearing, circuitized surface of the
substrate.A relatively high density of chip connections is readily
achieved by mounting one or more semiconductor chips on the
circuitized surface of a chip carrier substrate in the so-called
flip chip configuration. In this configuration, the
chip or chips are mounted face-down on solderable metal
pads on the substrate using solder balls. However, the
coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of, for example, a
silicon chip is significantly different from the CTE of a
ceramic substrate or plastic substrate. As a consequence,
if a chip carrier is subjected to thermal fluctuations,
then the solder ball connections will be subjected to
significant stresses, which tend to weaken, and reduce the
fatigue life of, the solder ball connections.
Significantly, this problem is readily overcome by
encapsulating the solder balls in an encapsulant having a
CTE which is within 30 percent of the CTE of the solder
balls. Useful such encapsulants have a composition which 
includes, for example, an epoxy binder, e.g. a
cycloaliphatic epoxide binder, and a filler, e.g. high
purity fused or amorphous silica, as disclosed in U.S.
Patent No. 4,999,699. As noted in this patent, the
binder should have a viscosity at room temperature which is
no greater than about 1000 centipoise and the filler should
have a maximum particle size which is no greater than 31
microns. Moreover, the binder should constitute about 60 to
about 25 percent by weight of the total of binder and
filler, while the filler should constitute about 40 to
about 75 percent by weight of the total.The circuitry on the circuitized surface of a chip carrier
substrate, and to a lesser extent the chip or chips mounted
in a flip chip configuration on the
