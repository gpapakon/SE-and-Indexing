<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is apparatus and method for treating prostate tumors. The apparatus includes a platform (11) on which the patient may be seated. An electromagnetic coil (12) is disposed beneath the platform (11) and creates a field that acts on thermoseeds placed in the tumor. The method includes inductively heating the thermoseeds which heat the tumor cells to a temperature of between 45 and 50  DEG C.

<DESCRIPTION>
 LOCAL APPLICAÎ—ON TUMOR TREATMENT APPARATUSField of the inventionThe present invention relates to medical treatment and more particularly to local treatment of tumors either cancerous or benign on an out patient basis.Background of the InventionThe present invention contemplates equipment for treatment of various localized tumors such as prostate, rectal, cervical or uterine. The term "tumor" as used herein refers to any abnormal tissue growth. In fact, the invention may be used for any temperature sensitive tumor. The present invention will be described with regard to a typical type of tumor suitable for treatment with the equipment of the present invention, namely, prostate cancer.Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in males in the United States, and the third most common cause of male cancer death. In 1986, an estimated 90,000 men in the US were diagnosed with prostate cancer, and 26,100 death from the disease were estimated to have occurred.Age has a major impact on the incidence of prostatic cancer. The disease is uncommon in men younger than age 50, but the incidence increases sharply to more than 1,000 per 100,000 man-years for American males age 85 and over. The average age of prostate cancer patients at the time of diagnosis is 73 years. For males over the age of 75, mortality due to prostate cancer is exceeded only by lung cancer. Relative to other forms of malignancy, this disease accounts for 21 percent of newly diagnosed cancers in males and 11 percent of cancer deaths.Many factors are involved in choosing 

 treatment modes for the individual patient. Those factors are patient age and anticipated life expectancy, associated medical problems, sexual potency, potential complications of therapy, and, ultimately, consideration for quality of life with and without therapy.In choosing appropriate treatment options, cost factors have been largely ignored in the past. The cost, including physician fees, of perineal prostatectomy is substantial with typically 8.0 hospitalization days required. The delivery of external radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer according to the present invention may be a 6-weeks- course on an outpatient basis. Treating patients with the method of the present invention, e.g. hyperthermia delivered on an outpatient basis, would lead to a reduction of hospital days associated with surgery. In the context of radiation therapy, effective hyperthermia can enhance the effect of radiation and result in a higher local cure rate. Traditionally radical

WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. A method of treatment for tumors, said method comprising the steps of inserting thermoseeds into the tumor so as to effectively immobilize the thermoseeds, and applying a magnetic field to said seeds to inductively heat said thermoseeds, said magnetic field being produced by a coil comprising multiple turns of electroconductive tubing, said coil producing a magnetic field strength of from 5 to 150 oersteds at the axis of the coil at the working space.
2. The method of claim 1 wherein the inserting step further comprises: inserting thermoseeds of ferrite or an alloy having a Curie point temperature between 45 and 60 degrees C.
3. The method of claim 2 wherein the inserting step further comprises: inserting thermoseeds which are of a combination of nickel and copper. 4. The method of claim 3 wherein the inserting step of claim 3 further comprises: inserting thermoseeds wherein the thermoseeds are an alloy of generally 70% nickel and 30% copper by weight. 5. The method of claim 3 wherein the inserting step of claim 3 further comprises: inserting thermoseeds which have a diameter of generally 1 mm and length of 10-30 mm. 6. The method of claim 3 wherein the step of applying the magnetic field of claim 1 further comprises: mounting a coil to a chair-like support in which a person with a tumor sits while the thermoseeds are acted upon by the 


 field of the coil.
7. The method of claim 6 wherein the step of applying the magnetic field of claim 6 further comprises: mounting the coil to a support which has a surface that is concave extending downwardly into the center of the upper end of the coil, whereby the tumor being treated is disposed in the field of the coil.
8. An apparatus for the treatment of prostate cancer, said apparatus comprising a platform for the support of a person having a prostate tumor and a coil formed of electrically conductive tubing, said platform having a seat with an upper surface, said upper surface being positioned within 4 cm of the uppermost turn of said coil, said upper surface being contoured for reproducibly receiving the buttocks of a person in alignment with the axis of said coil. 9. The apparatus of claim 8 wherein said apparatus further comprises a power source, said power source and said coil being capable of producing a magnetic field strength of 5 to 150 oersteds.
10. The apparatus of claim 9 wherein said coil has a diameter of from generally 20 cm to 65 cm and a length of generally 15 cm to 45 cm.
11. The apparatus of claim 10 wherein said coil is of copper tubing and has generally 10 turns.
12. The apparatus of claim 11 wherein said coil has a working field volume of generally 20 cm in diameter and generally 15 cm in height.
13. The apparatus of claim 11 wherein said coil has a working field that extends about 20 cm above the upper most turn of the coil. 14. The apparatus of claim 12 wherein said 


platform is a chair-like structure on which the person may be seated during treatment.
15. The apparatus of claim 14 wherein said platform is concave and extends downwardly into the center of the diameter of the coil, whereby the seat upper surface is positioned well within the field of the coil during treatment.
16. An apparatus for treatment of cancerous tumors, sid apparatus comprising a power source and a coil capable of producing a magnetic field strength of between 5 and 150 oersteds, and an articulated arm for carrying and supporting said coil adjacent a human body part having a cancerous tumor.
17. The apparatus of claim 16 wherein said apparatus further includes a chair-like support with a second coil, said power source and said coil being capable of producing a magnetic field having a magnetic field strength of between 10 and 100 oersteds.
18. The apparatus of claim 16 wherein said coil has at least 50 turns of fine conductor.
19. The apparatus of claim 18 wherein said second coil has from 5 to 15 turns of copper tubing.
