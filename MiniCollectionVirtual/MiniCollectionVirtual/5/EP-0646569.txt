<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel phospholipase A2
inhibitors. More particularly, this invention is directed to
carboxylic acid derivatives consisting of aromatic rings straight-chained
structure and having phospholipase A2 inhibitory activity.Phospholipase A2 is an enzyme which exists in a cell and a
secretory liquid of many animals, in particular, a venom of snakes,
mammalian pancreas, blood platelet of various animals, arthritis
exudate of higher animals or the like. This enzyme specifically
hydrolyzes phospholipids. For example, the enzyme specifically
hydrolyzes C-2 positioned fatty acid esters of 1, 2-diacylglycerol
phospholipid to form lysoglycerol phospholipids and fatty acids. It
has been pointed out that, in association with this enzymatic
activity, phospholipase A2 can show toxicity to vascular nerve,
muscle, arthrosis, heart, lung, trachea or the like, induce
convulsion, vasoconstriction, tracheal constriction, edema or the
like, and cause arthritis, sepsis, asthma, respiratory insufficiency
or the like.If the enzymatic activity of phospholipase A2 could be
inhibited various diseases caused by or associated with said
activity could be treated. From such a point of view, the present
applicant has disclosed natural thielocin, a phospholipase A2
inhibitor in Japanese Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 286088/1990, 
Japanese Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 117346/1992,
etc. and synthetic thielocin homologs in WO 93/01157.FR-A-2,241,296 discloses some compounds of
formulae (IV) and (V) and specifically compounds 20
and 21 as having hypolipidaemic activity; no mention
is made however of compounds having inhibitory
activity on cPLA2.It has recently been found that phospholipase A2 includes
intracellular PLA2 (cPLA2) and secretory PLA2 (sPLA2) which can be
clearly discriminated. It is well known that intracellular PLA2
more preferentially hydrolyzes phospholipids containing
arachidonate ester in the 2 position than the secretory PLA2.
However, there is no report on the inhibitory activity of the cPLA2.Paying attention to the structure of natural thielocin
derivatives which can inhibit phospholipase A2 activity, the present
inventors have found novel compounds which inhibit both cPLA2 and
sPLA2 by chemical modification of said natural thielocin. The
compounds of the present invention can be expected to reduce the
action of a substance inducing inflammation by suppressing the
isolation of arachidonic acid from phospholipid and inhibiting
thereby the production of various prostaglandins and
