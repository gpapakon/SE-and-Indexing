<ABSTRACT>
In order to electrodialytically purify the electrolyte of a galvanic bath, a pickling bath or the like, the bath liquid (process electrolyte) is led in a closed circuit through a first chamber (21) of an electrodialysis cell (20) in order to be continuously regenerated. The first chamber (21) has a wall designed as a partially permeable membrane (33) and is submerged within a bath formed by a second larger chamber (22). The second chamber (22) contains an auxiliary electrolyte separated by the membrane (33) from the process electrolyte. One of the chambers (21 or 22) has the anode (31) and the other chamber the cathode (32) of an electric d.c. voltage source (30). This device allows a continuous electrodialytic regeneration process of the process electrolyte to be carried out. For that purpose, the auxiliary electrolyte is led in a closed circuit through the second chamber (22) that contains the first chamber (21) and that acts as an auxiliary electrolyte bath. As auxiliary electrolyte, a carboxylic acid is preferably used. The auxiliary electrolyte preferably contains a conducting salt.
