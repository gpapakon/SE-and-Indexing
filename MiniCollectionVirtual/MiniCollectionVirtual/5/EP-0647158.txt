<ABSTRACT>
A method for delignifying and bleaching a lignocellulose material, wherein an aqueous solution of a redox catalyst and an oxidant is reacted with said material. Said catalyst comprises an organometallic cation of general formula (VII): ((l)Mno2Mn(L))n+, wherein Mn is manganese (III) or (IV) oxide, the two Mn's of this cation may form a pair in a III-III, III-IV or IV-IV oxidative state, n is 2, 3 or 4, O is oxygen, and L is a ligand comprising 4 nitrogen atoms co-ordinating the manganese.

Process according to claim 1, characterised in that the pH is between 2 and 5. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 2, characterised in that, after the 
oxidation reaction, the lignocellulose material obtained is treated with a basic 

aqueous solution. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the said oxidising 
agent is added little by little to the solution of the redox catalyst so that there is not 

an excess of the said oxidising agent which can react directly with the said 
lignocellulose material. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the said oxidising 
agent is chosen from ozone, hydrogen peroxide, an alkyl hydroperoxide, 

hypochlorous acid, chlorine, chlorine dioxide or one of their mixtures.
