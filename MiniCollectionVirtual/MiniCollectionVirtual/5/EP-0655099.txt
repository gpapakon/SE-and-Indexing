<ABSTRACT>
The invention ralates to a method for building in the ground a structure (1) with a floor located at a floor level (9) under ground level, wherein in at least one construction excavation area (5) ground is excavated to a level that is lower than the floor level (9), wherein after excavation of the ground a construction space (5) is closed off inside the construction excavation area with a foil (14), for instance of plastic, and wherein drainage provisions (20) are arranged under the floor level. In a known method of this type the foil is arranged in a construction space, the sides of which are bounded by ground with a natural slope. This requires much space which is permanently removed from the area surrounding the structure. This moreover requires much earthwork. In addition the surface enclosed by the foil collects much rainwater which has to be pumped away. The invention has for its object to reduce at least partly the drawbacks of the said known method. For this purpose the method according to the invention has the feature that the construction excavation area (5) is closed off with at least one construction excavation wall of steel profiles (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method as designated in
the preamble of claim 1.Such a method is known from "Civiele en Bouwkundige
Techniek", no.8, September 1983, pages 21-24. Herein the
foil is arranged in a construction space, the sides of
which are bounded by ground with a natural slope. This
requires much space which is permanently removed from the
area surrounding the structure. This moreover requires
much earthwork. In addition, the surface enclosed by the
foil collects much rainwater which has to be pumped away.The invention has for its object to reduce at least
partly the drawbacks of the said known method.The method according to the invention has for this
purpose the characteristic of claim 1.The invention also relates to and provides a structure
built with use of the invented method. If the steel
profiles are removed from the ground after arranging of
the foil (14) the costs of this method are reduced considerably.Mentioned and other features of the invention will
be elucidated in the description of the invention following
hereinbelow with reference to drawings, in which:
Figure 1 shows a top view of a structure during
application of the method according to the invention;Figures 2-12 show on a larger scale the sections II-II
to XII-XII indicated in figure 1;Figure 13 shows the section XIII-XIII of figure 1;Figures 14 and 16 show on a larger scale a top view
of fraction XIV in figure 1 with two different embodiments;Figure 15 shows the section XV-XV of figure 14;Figure 17 shows a vertical section along the line
XVII-XVII in figure 16;Figures 18-20 show sections corresponding with
figures 6-8 relating to another embodiment variant of the
method according to the invention; and Figure 21 shows on a larger scale detail XXI of
figure 18.In order to build a structure 1 according to the
invention, which is drawn as example in completed state
in figure 12 with dimensions in millimetres and which
comprises carriageways 2 for road traffic located below
ground level (MV), the method according to the invention
is applied as shown schematically in successive steps in
figures 1-11 and 13.Figure 2: Steel sheet piling profiles 3 are struck
into the ground to form sheet-pile walls 4 to enclose a
construction excavation area 5.Figure 3: The sheet-pile walls 4 are anchored in
transverse direction by means of grouted anchors 6 or by
means of cross struts 7 indicated with dashed lines.The ground is excavated from the construction excavation
area 5 to a level 8 lower than the floor level 9
of the carriageways 2 and

Method for building in the ground a
structure (1) with a floor (2) located at a floor level

(9) under ground level, wherein in at least one
construction excavation area (5) ground is excavated to a

level that is lower than the floor level (9), wherein
after excavation of the ground a construction space is

closed off inside the construction excavation area (5)
with a watertight foil (14), for instance of plastic, and wherein

drainage provisions (20) are arranged under the floor
level (9), 
characterized by
 the following steps:

the construction excavation area (5) is closed
off with at least one construction excavation wall (4) of

steel profiles (3) forming sheet-pile walls (4);
the ground is excavated from the construction
excavation area (5) to a level (8) lower than the floor

level (9) of the carriageways (2) and higher than the
bottom edge (10) of the sheet-pile walls (4);
support shields (11) are placed;
in the channels (18) between sheet-pile walls
(4) and support shields (11) are arranged water-inhibiting

layers (12);
a watertight foil (14) is laid in the space
between said support shields (11), wherein its side

pieces (15) are erected against said support shields (11)
such that the construction excavation area forms a pan

which is sealed off by said foil (14);
ground is arranged up to floor level (9) inside the foil (14) and in
said channels (18), wherein the necessary drainage pipes

(20) are incorporated in this ground; and

characterized in that
 in at least a part of the
construction excavation area (5) filler material, for

example sand, is arranged simultaneously on either side
