<ABSTRACT>
Improved process for the fluidisation of flocculated aqueous red mud suspensions in the manufacture of bauxite by the Bayer process, which consists:     . in dissolving bauxite with sodium hydroxide solution, . then in separating by settling and in washing the red muds formed in order to separate them from the alumina in successive tanks, the washing liquors being recycled upstream,   . and finally in removing the red muds thus treated, and in which a flocculating agent (F), consisting of a polyacrylamide with a molecular weight greater than ten million, is introduced into the suspension in one of the successive tanks; characterised in that, simultaneously with this flocculating agent (F), a dispersing agent (D), formed by an anionic acrylic acid polymer with a molecular weight of less than fifty thousand, is added to the suspension and in the same tank.

A process for fluidifying flocculated aqueous suspensions of 
red muds in the production of alumina from bauxite by the Bayer process 

which consists: 

in dissolving bauxite using sodium hydroxide ; 
then, in decanting and in washing file red muds formed in order to 
separate them from the alumina in successive vats, while recycling 

the washing waters upstream ; 
and finally, in eliminating the red muds thus treated ; 
 
and in which a flocculant (F) consisting of a polyacrylamide of molecular 

weight greater than ten million is introduced into the suspension of one 
of the successive vats ;
wherein
 a dispersing agent (D) formed by an anionic acrylic acid 
polymere of molecular weight lower than fifty thousand is added 

simultaneously with said flocculant (F) to the suspension in the same 
vat. 
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the polyacrylamide 
(F) has an anionicity between 20 and 100 mol%. 
The process as claimed in one of claims 1 and 2, wherein the 
anionic flocculant (F) is an acrylic acid homopolymer, a polyacrylamide 

copolymer or a linear terpolymer. 
The process as claimed in one of claims 1 to 3, wherein the 
dispersing agent (D) is a sodium polyacrylate of molecular weight 

between one thousand and ten thousand.  
 
The process as claimed in one of claims 1 to 4, wherein, in the 
mixture (F + D), the amount by weight of flocculant (F) relative to the 

amount by weight of dispersing agent (D) is between 0.1 and 5 and is 
preferably in the region of one. 
The process as claimed in one of claims 1 to 5, wherein the 
addition of the mixture of flocculant (F) and dispersing agent (D) is 

carried out in any one of the latter vats (20, 25) for decanting the red 
muds. 
The process as claimed in one of claims 1 to 6, wherein the 
mixture of flocculant (F) and dispersing agent (D) is introduced at 

ambient temperature in aqueous suspension, at a concentration between 
0.1 and 20 g/liter, and preferably 1 to 10 g/liter, in a proportion fo 5 to 150 

grams/tonne of dry red mud suspension to be treated. 
The process as claimed in one of claims 1 to 7, wherein the 
amount of the mixture produced is between five and two thousand and 

grams per tonne (5 to 2,000 g/t) of muds, preferably between twenty and 
four hundred grams per tonne (20 to 400 g/t).
