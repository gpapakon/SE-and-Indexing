<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for the storage, delivery and mixing of fluid 
substances. The apparatus consists of a compact, pre-assembled, 

movable operative unit, enabling the storage of a large number 
of substances and the management of a large number of delivery 

points in an extremely small area. The apparatus comprises a 
conveyor (12) and at least one set of storage tanks (11) on a 

support frame (10) along one or both sides of the conveyor 
(12); pumping means (19) and a multi-valve delivery head (15) 

are provided for supplying metered quantities of the substances 
to be mixed, in a container (14) positioned on a conveyor 

section (12') above an electronic scales (17). The electronic 
scales (17) and corresponding section (12') of the conveyor are 

laterally translatable on a vertically movable shelf (18) to 
selectively position a mixing container (14) under a multi-valve 

unit (15) according to an operative program governed by 
a programmable control unit; a mixer (16) is provided at the 

end of the conveyor which is opposite to multi-valve unit (15).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an automatic apparatus in the
form of a pre-assembled programmable operative unit for the
storage, delivery and mixing of metered quantities of fluid
substances, used for example during the preparation of dyeing
baths, dyeing substances and the like, by means of which it is
possible to group together and manage in a small area, a
plurality of storage tanks and the associated means for
supplying metered quantities of the various substances which
must be mixed, under the control of a logic processing unit.During the preparation of mixtures from fluid substances, for
example during the preparation of dyes for the textile
industry, paints and auxiliary agents in general, the
individual substances or individual ingredients to be mixed are
contained in respective storage tanks from which they are taken
in metered quantities which are controlled by means of weighing
operations.For this purpose, various apparatuses have been developed, as a
result of which it is possible to deliver automatically and mix
metered quantities of the various substances, removing them in
a controlled manner from the respective storage containers.The documents US-A-4,526,215, EP-A-0,344,521, EP-A-0,537,434
and EP-A-0 427 497 
describe some examples of automatic metering apparatuses which
can be used in different application sectors.In particular, EP-A-0,344,521 describes a metering and mixing
plant comprising a plurality of tanks arranged at a suitable
distance from one another on a fixed support structure which
extends along a path for a carriage provided with a container
into which in each case the metered quantities of the
individual substances are poured, said substances being
subsequently introduced into a mixer located underneath the
path of the carriage suporting the container. Each tank is
provided moreover with a screw feeder which discharges said
substances into an auxiliary container tiltably supported by a
weighing device, underneath which the container is arranged in
order to receive the substances to be mixed. This solution
requires on-site assembly of the entire plant which, once
installed, cannot be displaced or removed; moreover, said plant
is extremely complicated and difficult to manage and cannot be
used in those applications where extremely precise doses are
required, both owing to the unreliable nature of the screw
metering system and on account of the possible accumulation of
errors of the various weighing devices associated with the
individual tanks. Moreover, the operating
