<ABSTRACT>
A "narrow band" public service trunking (PST) simulcast radio 
frequency transmission system having high-speed and low-speed digital data 

access capabilities in addition to analog voice operates in the 900 MHz 
frequency range, as distinguished from a conventional "wide band" PST 

system that operates in the 800 MHz frequency range. In a narrow band PST 
simulcast system having digital access capabilities, the handling of low speed 

digital data must be accomplished differently than high speed data since it 
becomes unique to each channel. This would ordinarily require providing an 

additional data path for each channel, which is neither feasible nor cost 
effective. Arrangements are therefore provided for the routing of low-speed 

data to each transmit site via the high-speed digital data channel path for each 
site and for holding the high-speed data resynchronization circuitry at each 

site at its previous latency during the transmission of low-speed data, which 
would otherwise cause erroneous triggering of the resynchronization circuitry.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to radio frequency (RF) signal transmission systems, 
and in particular to "simulcasting" systems for providing the simultaneous 
transmission of the same information by two or more separately located RF 
transmitters. More particularly, the invention relates to the operation of a 
"narrow band" (900 MHz) digital access trunked communication simulcast 
system, and still more particularly to an improved method and apparatus for 
distributing low speed data to transmitting sites in a narrow band PST 
simulcast system. Radio repeater trunking (i.e., time sharing of a single repeater 
communications channel among many users) is well known. Although there 
are many actual potential applications for trunked radio repeater systems, one 
of the more important applications is for public service trunked (PST) 
systems. Various known prior trunked communication system of this sort 
offer the capability of handling high speed digital data communications (e.g., 
digitally encrypted voice) in addition to conventional analog voice 
communications and, thus, provide users with selectable digital access to the 
trunked system. An exemplary digital access PST system is discussed in  
 
commonly-assigned U.S. Patent No. 4,905,302 to Childress et al entitled 
"Trunked Radio Repeater System," which is incorporated by reference herein. As is well known, it may not be possible for a single RF repeater 
transmitting site to satisfactorily serve a geographically large coverage area. 
Accordingly, systems which must provide RF communications for an entire 
large geographical area (e.g., a major metropolitan area, a large county, etc.) 
typically include multiple RF transmissions sites. FIGURE 1 is a schematic 
diagram of a simplified multiple-site "simulcast" system having three radio 
repeater (transmitting) sites S1, S2 and S3 for providing simulcast 
communications to geographical coverage areas A1, A2 and A3, respectively. 
A control point or "hub" C (e.g., a dispatch center) provides identical signals 
to each of sites S1 through S3 via links L1 through L3, respectively. These 
links are typically microwave links. Each site S1-S3 transmits the signals it 
receives from the control point C to its respective coverage area A, so that a 
mobile or portable transceiver receives the same signal no matter where it 
happens to be in the communications system overall coverage area A (which 
constitutes the "union", in an analogy to Venn diagrams of the individual 
coverage areas A1, A2 and A3). Mobile or

In a radio frequency communications system having plural RF 
spatially separated RF transmitters all transmitting substantially the same 

signal at substantially the same radio frequency, said system distributing 
common a clocking signal to each of said plural transmitters so as to provide 

substantially simultaneous signal transmission by said plural transmitters and 
also distributing a control signal to each of said transmitters indicative of 

either a high or low speed digital data transmission, each of said plural RF 
transmitters including: 

   a first circuit arrangement, which determines, at least in part, the 
timing of high-speed digital data signal transmissions; 

   a second circuit arrangement which suspends operation of said first 
circuit in response to said control signal indicating the transmission of low 

speed-data; and 
   a third circuit arrangement for controlling the routing of both high-speed 

and low-speed digital data to each transmitter over a single common 
high-speed digital data channel. 
In a narrow band type public service trunked simulcast radio 
frequency transmission system having at least one high-speed digital channel 

path to each transmitter site and high-speed data resynchronization circuitry at 
each site, a method for providing both high-speed and low-speed digital data 

access capabilities, comprising the steps of: 
   routing low-speed digital data to each transmit site via the high-speed 

digital data channel path for each site; and 
   holding the high-speed data resynchronization circuitry at each site in 

a non-operative state during the transmission of low-speed data, thus 
preventing a triggering of the resynchronization circuitry, so as to maintain 

 
said a previous latency condition of said high-speed data resynchronization 

circuitry.
