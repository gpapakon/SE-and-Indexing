A lock device having a double cylinder and a preferably motor-actuated 
rotary knob, wherein one cylinder core (13) of the double 

cylinder is rotatable by a key and the other cylinder core (14) is 
rotatable by a rotary knob, characterised in that the cylinder core (14) 

which is rotatable by the rotary knob has a locking mechanism which 
corresponds to that of the other cylinder core (13) and that said 

locking mechanism is permanently unlocked by an inserted key (11) so 
that the corresponding cylinder core (14) is permanently actuable by the 

shaft (4) of the rotary knob. 
A lock device according to claim 1 characterised in that the 
shaft (4) of the rotary knob is connected to the associated cylinder 

core (14) by way of the key (11). 
A lock device according to claim 2 characterised in that for 
connecting the shaft (4) and the key (11) there is provided an 

intermediate portion (8) which relative to the shaft (4) can perform a 
pivotal movement
 which is restricted by abutments (16). 
A lock device according to claim 3 characterised in that the 
intermediate portion (8) is provided with a radially extending slot (17) 

into which the shortened gripping portion (18) of the key (11) can be 
fitted. 
A lock device according to one of claims 1 to 4 characterised 
in that the rotary knob together with the associated drive is mounted on 

a mounting flange (10) which can be fitted on to the cylinder housing 
(12).
