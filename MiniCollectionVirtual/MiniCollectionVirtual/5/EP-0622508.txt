<ABSTRACT>
The locking device consists of a key (2) and a lock 
cylinder (1), with a cylinder core (5) which is rotatable in 

a casing (3) and has an axially extending channel (16) for 
insertion of a key (2) which passes through plate-shaped 

tumblers (7) arranged axially in succession so as to be 
displaceable in the cylinder core (5) and, with bit stages 

provided on the key shank (13), locates these tumblers (7) 
in a position releasing the rotation of the cylinder core 

(5). The locating displacement movement of the tumbler 
plates (7) is designed as a rotational movement round the 

axis of the key shank (13), and its range is preferably 
limited by stops (21, 22).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a locking device consisting of
a key and a lock cylinder, with a cylinder core which is
rotatable in a casing and has an axially extending channel
for insertion of a key which passes through plate-shaped
tumblers arranged axially in succession so as to be
displaceable in the cylinder core and, with bit stages
provided on the key shank, locates these tumblers in a
position in which the cylinder core can rotate.Many locking devices of this type are known (e.g. GB-A-2 104 143). The
plate-shaped tumblers are spring-loaded in the direction of
their engagement position and, with their blocking ends,
enter associated longitudinal grooves of the cylinder casing
in the key removal position. By insertion of the associated
key which has the bit stages designed in the form of closing
notches on its narrow sides, the tumbler plates are located
in the cylinder core by longitudinal displacement such that
the blocking ends leave the grooves of the cylinder casing.
The cylinder core can then be rotated by means of the key.It is an object of the present invention to provide a
locking device of this type which is simple to produce such
that the tumbler plates may be located without longitudinal
displacement thereof, that is transversely to the
longitudinal direction of the cylinder core.The present invention provides a locking device
consisting of a key and a lock cylinder, with a cylinder
core which is rotatable in a casing and has an axially
extending channel for insertion of a key which passes
through plate-shaped tumblers having broad faces, the
tumblers being arranged axially in succession so as to be
displaceable in the cylinder core and, with bit stages
provided on the key shank, locates these tumblers in a
position releasing the rotation of the cylinder core,the
locating displacement movement of the tumbler plates being a 
rotational movement round the axis of the key shank, the
device being characterised in that the broad faces of the
tumbler plates are supported relative to one another by
rolling members.The range of rotational movement is
preferably limited by stops.This design produces a locking device which is
distinguished, on the one hand, by a simple construction
and, on the other hand, by an improved method of locking.
The tumbler plates are accordingly designed as rotating
discs and are brought, by insertion of the appropriate key,
into a position which allows subsequent rotation of the
cylinder core. The rotatable design of the tumbler plates
leads to low bearing friction.

Locking device consisting of a key (2) and a
lock cylinder (1), with a cylinder core (5) which is

rotatable in a casing (3) and has an axially extending
channel (16) for insertion of the key (2) which passes

through plate-shaped tumblers (7) having broad faces, the
tumblers being arranged axially in succession so as to be

displaceable in the cylinder core (5) and, with bit stages
provided on the key shank (13), locates these tumblers (7)

in a position releasing the rotation of the cylinder core
(5), the locating displacement movement of the tumbler

plates (7) being a rotational movement round the axis of the
key shank (13), the device being characterised in that the

broad faces of the tumbler plates (7) are supported relative
to one another by rolling members.
Locking device according to claim 1
characterised in that the broad face of the tumbler plates

(7) are ball-mounted relative to one another.
Locking device according to either claim 1 or
claim 2 characterised in that a ball cage plate (8) extends

between each two tumbler plates (7) with inserted balls (9)
projecting beyond both broad sides.
Locking device according to any ofclaims 1 to
3, characterised in that the range of displacement of the

rotational angle of the individual tumbler plates (7) is
limited by stops (21, 22).
Locking device according to any of claims 1

least one recess (26, 27, 28) provided at its periphery such
that, in the case of located tumbler plates (7), these

recesses (26, 27, 28) form an entry space for a blocking 
strip (29, 30, 31) which entry space extends parallel to a

blocking strip (29, 30, 31) in such a way that the blocking
strip (29, 30, 31) releases the rotation of the cylinder

core.

to 5 characterised in that the key shank penetration orifice

(38) of the tumbler plate (7) and the cross section of the
key shank (13) have substantially semi-circular basic shapes

and the secant-shaped base (20) of the key shank (13) is the
carrier of the bit stages (40) of the key (2).
Locking device according to any of claims 1
to 6 characterised in that the key shank (13) opposing the

base (20) has at least one longitudinal groove (18) for the
entry of a centering projection (17) projecting into the key

channel (16).
Locking device according to any of claims 1
to 7 characterised in that the bit stages (40) of the key

(2) form undulating lines (L1, L2) which extend differently
on one base longitudinal edge (K1) from the other base

longitudinal edge (K2).

the key are smallest on the longitudinal centre line of the
base (20).
Locking device according to any of claims 1

base longitudinal edge transversely to the longitudinal
direction of the key.

to 10 characterised in that the key channel (16) has a

circular cross section and the secant line (39) of the key
shank through orifice (38) intersects the cross section of
