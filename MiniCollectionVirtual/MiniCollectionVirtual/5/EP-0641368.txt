<ABSTRACT>
An injection moldable composition containing an aromatic polymer including a heterocyclic group, a low viscosity melt processible at least partially aromatic polymer selected from the group consisting of polyethers, polyketones, polyetherketones, polyether-ether ketones, polyamides, and polyesters, and a reinforcing agent. The reinforcing agent is glass fiber, carbon fiber, or a combination thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
 REINFORCED INJECTION MOLDAB E BLENDSBackground Of The InventionThis invention relates to the field of polymer blends, especially fiber-reinforced injection moldable blends.A variety of polymer blends are known in the art, including injection moldable blends. Polymer blends are made to take advantage of a synergy between the blended polymers, or to combine different properties not found in a single polymer.Polymers are sometimes mixed with fibers, e.g., glass fibers, graphite fibers, etc., to physically reinforce the polymer and enhance the physical properties of the neat polymer. Fiber reinforcement can be a simple and inexpensive way to obtain a polymer composition having certain desired properties.U.S. Patent Number 5,070,153 discloses an injection molded article formed from a homogeneous mixture comprising polybenzimidazole and polyaryleneketone.U.S. Patent Number 4,912,176 discloses a sintered molded article formed from a homogeneous mixture comprising polybenzimidazole and polyaryleneketone. Fillers may be included in these, including glass and carbon fiber.U.S. Patent Number 4,965,310 discloses wear resistant blends comprising at least one polyaryletherketone and at least one polyimide. 

 U.S. Patents Number 4,980,447 and 5,071,948 disclose polyamide-polyimide and polybenzazole-polyimide polymers that may be molded, and may be compounded with fibers to form high strength structures.U.S. Patent Number 4,340,697 discloses a heat resistant molding resin comprising an aromatic polyamideimide resin and a thermoplastic resin. The composition may be filled with fibers or other fillers.Other patents relating to polymer blends include U.S. Patents Number: 4,973,629; 4,973,630; and 5,047,487.The disclosures of the patents cited above are incorporated by reference herein.Summary Of The InventionThe present invention is an injection moldable composition comprising: a first polymer selected from the group consisting of polymers represented byandwhere A and A1 each independently represent B represents 0 or NH, R1 represents CH2, R2 represents H or CH3, R represents either a covalent bond or CR3R4, R3 and R4 each independently represent H or CXYZ, and X, Y, 
and Z are each independently H, F, or Cl;a melt processible polymer including aromatic recurring moieties, having a viscosity of no more than about 300 centipoise, said melt processible polymer selected from the group consisting of polyethers, polyketones, polyetherketones, polyether-ether ketones, polyamides, and polyesters; and,a reinforcing agent
