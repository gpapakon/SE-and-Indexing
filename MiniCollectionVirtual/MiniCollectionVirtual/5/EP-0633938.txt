<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed are methods for producing an aqueous solution containing substantially pure EG III cellulase component using alcohol. Specifically, an aqueous mixture of enzymes containing the EG III cellulase component is mixed with an effective amount of a low molecular weight alcohol in the presence of an organic salt such that the cellulase proteins, other than the EG III component, are precipitated from the solution resulting in a substantially pure EG III component.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to methods for
producing an aqueous solution containing a
substantially pure EG III cellulase component. In
particular, the methods of the present invention are
directed, in part, to the removal of cellulase
proteins, except the EG III cellulase component, from
an aqueous mixture of cellulase proteins containing EG
III by the addition of a low molecular weight alcohol
to the aqueous mixture in the presence of an organic
salt. In a preferred embodiment, the pH of the aqueous
mixture is adjusted to at least about pH=7 before the
addition of the alcohol. In another preferred
embodiment, an inorganic salt is added to the EG III-rich
supernate to precipitate the remaining
contaminating proteins resulting in a substantially
pure EG III composition. The methods of the present
invention are also directed in part to the enrichment
of xylanase from an aqueous solution containing
xylanase.Cellulases are known in the art as enzymes that
hydrolyze cellulose (β-1,4-glucan linkages) thereby 
resulting in the formation of glucose, cellobiose,
cellooligosaccharides, and the like. While cellulases
are produced (expressed) in fungi, bacteria and the
like, cellulase produced by certain fungi and, in
particular by the fungus class Trichodermaspp.
(especially Trichodermareesei), have been given the
most attention because a complete cellulase system
capable of degrading crystalline forms of cellulose is
readily produced in large quantities via fermentation
procedures.In regard to the above, Schulein, "Methods in
Enzymology", 160, 25, pages 234 et seq. (1988),
disclose that complete fungal cellulase systems
comprise several different enzyme classifications
including those identified as exo-cellobiohydrolases
(EC 3.2.1.91) ("CBH"), endoglucanases (EC 3.2.1.4)
("EG"), and β-glucosidases (EC 3.2.1.21) ("BG"). The
fungal cellulase classifications of CBH, EG and BG can
be further expanded to include multiple components
within each classification. For example, multiple CBHS
and EGs have been isolated from a variety of fungal
sources.The complete cellulase system comprising CBH, EG
and BG components is required to efficiently convert
crystalline cellulose to glucose. Isolated components
are far less effective, if at all, in hydrolyzing
crystalline cellulose. Moreover, a synergistic
relationship is observed between the cellulase
components particularly if they are of different
classifications.On the other hand, cellulases and components
thereof, used either singularly or in combination, are
also known

A method for preparing an aqueous solution enriched in
xylanase from an aqueous mixture containing cellulase proteins

and xylanase which method comprises:

(a) adding an organic salt to the aqueous mixture in an amount
of about 5% to less than 30% (w/v) of organic salt per original

volume of the aqueous mixture,

adding an amount of a low molecular weight alcohol of about 1.5
to 2.5 parts (v/v) of alcohol per volume of the aqueous mixture

to the aqueous mixture containing cellulase proteins under
conditions wherein substantially all of the cellulase proteins

other than EG III are precipitated and so as to provide an
aqueous supernate enriched in xylanase, and
(b) removing the precipitate from the aqueous supernate produced
in (a) above.
The method according to claim 1 wherein the organic salt
comprises a salt selected from the group consisting of sodium

acetate, zinc acetate, sodium formate and sodium benzoate.
The method according to claim 1, further comprising adding
an effective amount of an inorganic salt to the supernate

produced in step (b) so to form a second precipitate and a
second supernate and removing said second precipitate from said

second supernate.

III from the second supernate and colle
cting the EG III
component.
