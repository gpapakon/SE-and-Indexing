<ABSTRACT>
Multiple resonant tunneling devices offer significant advantages for 
realizing circuits which efficiently convert values represented by multivalued 

number systems to conventional binary representation. In one form of the 
invention, a number represented by a range-4 base-2 word is converted into a 

conventional binary word (range-2 base-2) having the same value. The 
conversion is accomplished by a series of decomposition stages 
53
, each 
decomposition stage 
53
 producing an interim range-4 base-2 word and a 
binary digit, which becomes one of the digits of the binary output word. 

Preferably, the decomposition at each stage is accomplished by a set of range-4 
base-2 to binary converters 
50
, each of which operates on a single digit of 
the interim word. Preferably, summation circuits 
52
 sum outputs of 
adjoining range-4 base-2 converters 
50
 to form the new interim word. The 
least significant digit of the output of the decomposition stage becomes a digit 

of the output binary word. Preferably, the range-4 base-2 to binary 
converters 
50
 are multi-level folding circuits 
54
 connected by a voltage 
divider. Preferably, the multi-level folding circuits contain multiple-peak 

resonant tunneling transistors 
56
 (e.g. an FET 
58
 and a multiple-peak 
resonant tunneling diode 
60
) which exhibit multiple negative differential 
transconductance. The novel circuits presented allow the results of 

multivalued logic operations to be translated to binary representation at very 
high speed. Additionally, because they make use of resonant tunneling  

 
devices, the novel converter circuits described herein may be fabricated with 

very few components.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to integrated circuit devices and more 
particularly to multivalued logic circuits comprising resonant tunneling 
devices. Without limiting the scope of the invention, its background is 
described in connection with resonant tunneling devices and multivalued 
logic. Within the last decade, heteroepitaxial technology has allowed 
researchers to explore the electrical properties of a variety of superlattice, 
quantum well, and resonant tunneling structures. The first proposals and 
investigations of the resonant tunneling diode (hereinafter referred to as a 
RTD) were reported by Chang, Esaki, and Tsu (Applied Physics Letters, 24, p. 
593) and subsequently given impetus by Sollner et al. (Applied Physics 
Letters, 43, p.588) who observed large negative differential resistance 
(hereinafter referred to as NDR) in these structures. Because only discrete  
 
energy states are available for charge transport through quantum wells, the 
current-voltage relationship of a resonant tunneling diode may exhibit a 
peak, i.e., for applied voltages increasing from zero, the diode current 
increases, then decreases for a range of larger applied voltages. Multiple 
peak resonant tunneling devices (hereinafter referred to as M-RTD) 
consisting of series combinations of RTDs in epitaxial stacks have also been 
demonstrated. Fifteen resonant peaks were achieved in a single 
heterostructure at room temperature recently fabricated at Texas 
Instruments. Since the initial investigations of the RTD, many three-terminal 
resonant tunneling devices have been proposed and demonstrated (see, for 
example, F. Capasso, S. Sen and F. Beltram, High Speed SemiconductorDevices (S.M. Sze, ed.), p. 465, John Wiley & Sons, New York). Integration of 
RTDs into one or another of the terminals of conventional transistors has led 
to a large family of resonant tunneling transistors. Among the most 
promising of these transistors are: the resonant tunneling bipolar transistor 
(RTBT) (see, for example, F. Capasso, S. Sen, and A.Y. Cho, Applied PhysicsLetters, 51, p. 526); the resonant tunneling hot electron transistor (RHET) 
(see, for example, N. Yokoyama et al., Solid State Electronics, 31, p. 577); and 
the resonant tunneling field effect transistor (RTFET). These devices are 
fabricated by placing RTDs in the emitter or drain terminals of 
heterojunction bipolar transistors, hot electron transistors or field effect 
transistors, respectively. Nanoelectronic devices, such as resonant tunneling diodes and 
tran
