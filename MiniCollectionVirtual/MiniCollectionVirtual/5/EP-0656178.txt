<ABSTRACT>
A nutritional composition is provided that is low 
in ammoniagenics, scavenges ammonia well, and yet does 

not contribute to excess nitric oxide production. The 
nutritional composition includes an amino acid profile 

having less than 20 percent of the total amino acids as 
ammoniagenic amino acids. The nutritional composition 

also includes less than 0.2 percent of the total amino 
acids as arginine and at least 0.2 percent of the total 

amino acids as ornithine and/citrulline.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to compositions and
methods for providing nutrition. More specifically the
present invention relates to compositions and methods for
the nutritional management of nitrogen metabolism.In the quest for sufficient food energy to meet
caloric requirements, animals ingest more nitrogen,
largely as amino acids, than they require. Accordingly,
the excess nitrogen ingested must be excreted in some
form. Through the action of a series of related enzymes
called transaminasis, virtually all metabolic nitrogen
can be transferred to α-ketoglutaric acid to form
glutamic acid. Under the influence of glutamic
dehydrogenase, glutamic acid may be oxidized by the
coenzyme diphosphopyridine nucleotide (DPN) with the
reformation of α-ketoglutaric acid plus ammonia.Since the resulting ammonia produced from the
oxidation of glutamic acid is toxic if it exceeds
"normal" levels, the body systems of all animals work to
convert the ammonia into urea to maintain ammonia levels
at acceptable levels. The liver is the major
site where ammonia is detoxified, by the concurring
interaction of both the urea cycle and the
glutamine/glutamate cycle.To accomplish the conversion of ammonia to urea,
advantage is taken of the enzymically catalyzed metabolic
sequence by which the amino acid arginine is synthesized
from ornithine, a sequence common to almost all living 
forms. Arginase catalyzes the hydrolysis of arginine to
urea plus ornithine, which is then available for
recycling.If the liver is compromised in its ability to
detoxify ammonia, due to systemic overproduction, hepatic
disease, disordered glutamine/glutamate metabolism, and
acidosis, ammonia levels can increase to unacceptable
levels. A common response to prevent excess ammonia in
these states is to terminate all nitrogen-containing
feeds. However, this is clinically unacceptable.An alternate maneuver is to provide a nutritional
source (especially the protein fraction) that produces
minimal ammonia. This approach is the basis for a number
of commercial products, that are designed to provide
nutritional support to hepatic patients. With such
products, the profile of amino acids is designed to
minimize the content of those amino acids that are the
most potent in terms of yielding free ammonia upon
metabolism commonly known as "ammonotelic" amino acids.
The ammonotelic amino acids (all in L-forms) are:
glycine; threonine; serine; histidine; tryptophan;
glutamine; and methionine. Limiting the production of
ammonotelic amino acids minimizes the exogenous
