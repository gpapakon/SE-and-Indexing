<ABSTRACT>
Precise positioning of image data on an imaging belt (30) in the 
electrostatographic printing process is accomplished using a 

positioning means. 
Lateral position of the imaging belt (30) is detected using a light 

source (40) and 
photodetector (44,72,130,208,226) determine an imaging belt edge 

position and tying the transfer of 
image data to that position. Circumferential position of the imaging 

belt is 
detected using one or more transparent windows which pass over the 

photodetector (44,72,130,208,226) which, in turn, is illuminated 
by the light source (40) when a window 

passes it. The signal from the detector is used to calculate a 
circumferential 

adjustment and either the light source or imaging belt motion is adjusted 
accordingly. Nonoptical embodiments using magnetic or capacitive 

detectors 
also can be used to detect the imaging belt circumferential position. A 

method for positioning image data on an imaging belt is also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of imaging belts for 
printers, photocopiers and the like, and more particularly, to controlling the 
precise positioning of images on imaging belts in machines using 
electrostatographic printing processes. Printers and photocopiers producing black and white images need 
to create and transfer one image to the paper. A number of mechanisms are 
used to achieve this transfer in a satisfactory manner. Complex images, such as 
color images, require that multiple images be placed sequentially one atop 
another to create the desired final image to be transferred to the paper. These 
multiple, sequential images must be placed with precise control to avoid 
degrading of the final image. Existing printers and photocopiers using electrostatographic 
printing processes to create images, such as laser printers, typically use a drum 
with photoconductive material on its outer surface. The drum is scanned by a 
laser beam writing image data to create the desired image on the drum that, in 
turn, is transferred to paper. Drums are quite useful for this purpose because 
effectively they are rigid bodies and their lateral and circumferential position can 
be controlled quite accurately. Using drums in combination with laser scanner 
units produce precisely positioned, high-definition images. Two different types of drums are used in the electrostatographic 
printing process. Many existing machines use a drum with a circumference 
shorter than the length of the paper to which the image is to be transferred. To 
transfer the complete image to the paper, the drum must rotate several times, 
transferring one portion of the image to the paper on each rotation, and then 
being scanned again to create the next portion of the image.  
 The use of software techniques to "smooth" the intersections 
between the adjoining portions of the image can produce a high-definition, black 
and white image using the small circumference drum. The small drum cannot 
produce a high-definition color or other complex image, because "smoothing" 
techniques are insufficient to print high-definition multiple, sequential images 
accurately. The second type of drum used in electrostatographic printing has a 
circumference equal to or longer than the length of the paper to which the image 
is to be transferred. With the large drum, only one rotation is needed to create 
and transfer an image to paper. The precision with which the large drum 
position can be controlled and its ability to transfer an image in one
