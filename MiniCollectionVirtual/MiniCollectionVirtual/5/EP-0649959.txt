<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for securing a motor-vehicle door lock. The device is of the "child safety" type comprising a control member (8) accessible from the outside when the door is open and mounted on the latter so as to be movable between a position blocking the control lever, this position being within the door lock, and a position of non-blocking of this lever. The device is characterised in that it comprises means (9, 27, 28) for displaying the state of blocking and/or of non-blocking of the securing member (8). The invention can be used for motor vehicles.

<CLAIMS>
Device for interlocking a door lock of an automotive 
vehicle, of the "children safety" type comprising a control 

member accessible from the outside when the door is open 
and mounted on the latter to be movable between a locking 

position of the inner control lever of the door lock and a 
non-locking position of this lever and means for 

visualizing the locking and/or non-locking state of the 
interlocking member, characterized in that the 

visualization means (27, 28) are made fast to for unitary 
movement with the interlocking member (8) and adapted to be 

disposed inside of the structure of a door so as to be 
visible through an opening (9) formed in the lining (1) of 

the door advantageously at the top thereof and in that the 
interlocking member is made in the shape of a lever (8) 

extended beyond its pivot pin (12) and thus comprising an 
internal arm (13) for driving a finger (15) made fast to 

for unitary rotation with a disk (16) carrying the 
aforesaid visualization means (27, 28). 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
visualization means are formed of two radial tongues (27, 

28) of the disk (16), advantageously provided with coloured 
markings to show the non-locking and locking states. 
Device according to one of claims 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the disk (16) is mounted for rotation about a bolt 

(20) which may be clipped onto the inner panel (19) of the 
door. 
Device according to claim 3, characterized in that the 
pivot bolt (20) of the disk (16) comprises means (21) for 

elastic holding upon the inner panel (19) of the door which 
are adapted to avoid any play about the pivot bolt.  

 
Device according to claim 4, characterized in that the 
bolt comprises axial tongues (21) provided with heels for 

the fastening through clipping onto the inner panel (19) of 
the door. 
Device according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterized 
by a transparent lunula (30) adapted to be snapped onto the 

lining (1) about an opening (9) formed in the door. 
Device according to claim 6, characterized in that the 
transparent lunula (30) has the shape of a magnifying 

glass.
