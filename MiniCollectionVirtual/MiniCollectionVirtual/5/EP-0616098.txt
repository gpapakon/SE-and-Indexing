The invention relates to a scaffolding platform element. The platform element comprises an elongate plate (32) equipped, at each of its ends, with means (40) for securing on scaffolding elements (44). The securing means comprise two hooks (42) each equipped with an extension (54) which bears on the adjacent platform element. Each securing means comprises, moreover, a locking system (46) which is mounted so as to pivot. The locking end (90) is held in a locking position by means of a counterweight (80) which also forms the handle in order to permit detachment of the scaffolding element from the platform element.
