<ABSTRACT>
A device for interconnecting tubes (1, 2) comprises a first tube (1) and a second tube (2) and an inner tube (3) bridging the interconnection region. The inner tube is secured in the one tube (1) and is insertable in the other (2) and is fixable by means of screws. The inner pipe (3) has a number of embossed portions (4) which force hard against the inner surface in the one outer tube (1) and thereby the inner tube (3) is positionally fixed. The embossed portions (4) are made after insertion of the inner tube (3) and do not damage an existing surface treatment on the outer tube (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a connection of a first and a second 
tube via an inner tube. In the manufacture of spiral stairs, a central column is employed which 
consists of tubes and which is normally divided up into sections with 
interconnections between the different sections included in the central 
column. As far as possible, this central column should have a smooth outer 
surface, since the staircase steps are screwed in place via anchorage 
plates which abut against the outer surface of the central column. 
Furthermore, it is crucial that the central column is straight despite the 
division into sections. Those loadings which the central column (or the entire spiral staircase) 
must be capable of withstanding are primarily loadings from normal use, i.e. 
essentially axial pressure loadings towards the central column. For safety 
reasons, the central column must also be capable of withstanding such 
axial upward draught as might, for example, be caused by the shock wave 
from an explosion on a lower storey level. Thus, the staircase must mot fail 
even in the event of such reverse loading. Spiral staircases of the type under consideration here are often used 
outdoors or in an industrial environment which may be corrosive. For this 
reason, the components of the spiral staircase are surface treated, often by 
hot galvanizing. In prior art devices for interconnecting central columns, holes are made in 
the circumferential surface of the outer tube, whereafter the inner tube is 
welded in place through these holes.  
 Since the tubes employed in the central column do not possess particularly 
good tolerances, there is a risk that the above-described welding operation 
results in the centre axes of the outer and the inner tube not coinciding with 
one another. Thus, problems relating to precision have commonly occurred 
in this prior art technique. The welding of the inner tube in the above-described manner has also 
entailed demands for considerable after-treatment if the outer surface of the 
outer tube is to be smooth. Furthermore, it has not proved possible to 
employ tubes hot galvanized beforehand, but it has been necessary instead 
to carry out the cutting, welding and finishing work before performing the hot 
galvanizing. This entails requirements on costly transport to and from the 
hot galvanizing plant. Other types of connections are known from US-A-4 123 180 and 
DE-A-2 949 814. US-A-4 123 180 discloses a connector system adapted to 
construction of temporary and permanent store

<CLAIMS>
A connection of a first (1) and a second (2) tube via 
an inner tube (3), 
characterised in that
, the 
inner tube (3) has a number of internal depressions (4) having been 

made by means of pressure means being urged against the 
internal surface of the inner tube and forcibly pressed 

thereagainst, thereby causing bulges (5) on the external 
surface of the inner tube, the bulges (5) engaging the first 

tube with a tight fit. 
The connection as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised in 
that
, the depressions and the bulges (5) are provided after 
inserting the inner tube (3) into the first tube (1). 
The connection as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised in 
that
, the depressions and the bulges (5) are provided prior 
to introducing the inner tube into the first tube (1). 
The connection as claimed in any one of claims 1-3, 

characterised in that
, the depressions and the bulges (5) 
are provided with uniform distribution in the circumferential 

direction. 
The connection as claimed in any one of claims 1-4, 

characterised in that
, the depressions and the bulges (5) 
are provided in rows parallel to the longitudinal axis of 

the inner tube (3).

characterised in that
, the depressions and the bulges (5) 
provided in the same diameter plane have been made 

concurrently. 
The connection as claimed in any one of claims 1-6, 

characterised in that
, all depressions and bulges (5) have 
been made concurrently.
