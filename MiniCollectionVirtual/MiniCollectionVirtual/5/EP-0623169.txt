<ABSTRACT>
Antigen and antibody vaccine compositions effective in preventing hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection are disclosed. The antigen composition includes a peptide corresponding to a carboxyl terminal end region of the capsid protein encoded by the second open reading frame (2) of the HEV genome. The composition is effective in preventing HEV infection after vaccination. The antibody composition contains an antibody effective to block HEV infection of human primary hepatocytes in culture.

LA, 1987.Enterically transmitted non-A/non-B hepatitis viral agent (ET-NANB, also referred to
herein as hepatitis E virus or HEV) is the reported cause of hepatitis in several epidemics and
sporadic cases in Asia, Africa, Europe, Mexico, and the Indian subcontinent. Infection is
caused usually by water contaminated with feces, although the virus may also spread by close
physical contact. The virus does not seem to cause chronic infection.The viral etiology in HEV has been demonstrated by infection of volunteers with pooled
fecal isolates; immune electron microscopy (IEM) studies have shown virus particles with 27-34
nm diameters in stools from infected individuals. The virus particles reacted with antibodies in
serum from infected individuals from geographically distinct regions, suggesting that a single
viral agent or class is responsible for the majority of HEV hepatitis seen worldwide. No
antibody reaction was seen in serum from individuals infected with parenterally transmitted
NANB virus (also known as hepatitis C virus or HCV), indicating a different specificity
between the two NANB types.In addition to serological differences, the two types of NANB infection show distinct
clinical differences. HEV is

<CLAIMS>
A vaccine composition for use in immunizing an individual against hepatitis E
virus (HEV) comprising, in a pharmacologically acceptable carrier, an HEV capsid

antigen

(A) consisting of one of the following sequences:

(i) Sequence ID No:17 of 436 amino acids,
(ii) Sequence ID No:18 of 435 amino acids, and
(iii) internally consistent variations between Sequence ID Nos. 17
and 18,

and
(B) capable of providing protection against HEV infection, as evidenced by the ability
of the antigen to protect cynomolgus monkeys inoculated with said antigen from

subsequent HEV challenge.
The composition of claim 1, wherein the peptide antigen is covalently coupled
to a carrier protein.
Use of an HEV capsid antigen consisting of one of the following sequences:

(i) Sequence ID No:17 of 436 amino acids,
(ii) Sequence ID No:18 of 435 amino acids, and
(iii) internally consistent variations between Sequence ID Nos. 17
and 18,
