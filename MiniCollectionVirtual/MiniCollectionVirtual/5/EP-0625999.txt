<ABSTRACT>
A novel storage stable crosslinkable aqueous polymeric formulation comprising an aqueous carrier; at least one polymeric ingredient having both acid-functional and acetoacetoxy functional pendant moieties; a non-polymeric polyfunctional amine having at least two amine-functional moieties; and base. The amount of base contained within the formulation is effective for inhibiting gellation, which would otherwise occur as a result of crosslinking between the acetoacetoxy functional and amine-functional moieties.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is generally directed to novel 
polymeric compositions of matter that are able to provide 
various substrates with crosslinked polymeric surface 
coatings and films at room temperature. Such compositions of 
matter may take the form of a solution, a dispersion, an 
emulsion, or a formulation, as dictated by a particular end-use 
requirement or other consideration. In that regard, one particularly noteworthy aspect of 
the present invention is directed to a formulation that is 
characterized as a storage-stable single-package novel 
polymeric composition of matter that contains at least one 
polymeric ingredient. Additional embodiments of the 
composition of matter of the present invention contain two or 
more polymeric ingredients. In the case where there is only 
one polymeric ingredient, the polymeric ingredient has both 
an acid-functional and an acetoacetoxy functional pendant 
moieties. In the case where there are two or more polymeric 
ingredients, one has only acid-functional pendant moieties 
and the other has only acetoacetoxy functional pendant 
moieties. Yet another ingredient of the novel composition of 
matter is a non-polymeric polyfunctional amine having at 
least two amine-functional moieties. The composition of matter of the present invention 
further includes base, in an amount that is effective for 
providing storage stability. The composition of matter additionally includes certain 
volatile, carrier ingredients that are able to evaporate at 
room temperature. Still another aspect of the present invention is 
directed to novel methods of producing the novel polymeric 
compositions of matter mentioned above. Yet another aspect of the present invention is directed 
to a method of applying the novel polymeric compositions of 
matter onto a substrate for purposes of producing a  
 
crosslinked polymeric surface coating on the substrate at 
room temperature. In February of 1988, F. Del Rector et al. presented in 
New Orleans, Louisiana, U.S.A., a paper entitled 
"Applications For The Acetoacetyl Functionality In Thermoset 
Coatings". These 3 authors reviewed some of the many then-known 
methods for incorporating activated methylene groups 
into different types or classes of resins for purposes of 
preparing polymeric thermoset surface coatings and films, via 
a number of known crosslinking mechanisms. More particularly, these authors discussed various well-known 
methods for reacting certain acetoacetyl-functional 
moiety-containing polymers with certain melamines,
