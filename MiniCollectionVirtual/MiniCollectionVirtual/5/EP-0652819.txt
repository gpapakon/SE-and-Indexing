<ABSTRACT>
A process for manufacturing micro-structured bodies made of plastics has the following steps: a) a micro-structured plate-like base body is used, the first side of which represents a first surface of reference and the second side of which is micro-structured in such a way that micro-structured bodies made of plastics project on a structure bottom, and the structure bottom and the reference surface extend parallel to each other; b) a second, micro-structured side of the base body is coated with a material; c) the surface of the base body-coating material is faced parallel to the first reference surface, forming a second reference surface; d) the base body is abraded on its first side parallel to the second reference surface at least until the structure bottom is reached, and then e) the material is selectively removed from the plastics.

Method of producing microstructured bodies from a 
plastics material, wherein 


a) a microstructured, plate-like base body (1, 2) is 
used, the first side (3) of which represents a first 

reference face, and the second side (4) of which is 
microstructured in such a manner that microstructured 

bodies (6), formed from the plastics material, protrude 
from a structure base (5), the structure base (5) and the 

reference face (3) extending parallel to each other, 
b) the second microstructured side (4) of the base 
body (1, 2) is coated with a material (14), 
c) the surface of the material (14), which coats the 
base body, is processed in a planar manner parallel to the 

first reference face (3), whereby a second reference face 
(15) is formed, 
d) the base body (1, 2) is abraded on its first side 
(3) parallel to the second reference face (15) at least 

until the structure base (5) is reached, whereupon 
e) the material (14) is selectively removed from the 
plastics material. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that 
a base body (2) is used, which is completely formed from 

the plastics material. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that 
a base body (1) is used, which is formed from a combination 

of the plastics material with a metal, wherein the first 
side (3) is formed by the metal, and the second side (4) is 

formed by the plastics material. 
Method according to claim 1, 2 or 3, characterised 
in that a base body (1, 2) is used, which is coated on its 

second side with a marker layer and/or protective layer.  
 
Method according to claim 4, characterised in that 
the material (14) is selectively removed from the plastics 

material in such a manner that the marker layer and/or 
protective layer is selectively eliminated both from the 

material and from the plastics material. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the coating of the second microstructured side of the base 

body according to step b) is effected in the following 
manner: 


the structure base (5) is coated with the material 
(14) to a level which lies in the region of the height of 

the microstructured bodies (6), 
the microstructured bodies (6) are mechanically 
processed, 
the second side (4) of the base body (1, 2), 
provided with the mechanically processed microstructured 

bodies (6), is coated with the material (14). 
Method according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the microstructured, plate-like base 

body (1, 2) is produced by moulding a microstructured tool 
(9) by means of the vacuum-stamping, reaction-moulding or 

injection-moulding processes known per se.
