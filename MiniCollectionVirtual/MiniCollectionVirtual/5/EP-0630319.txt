<ABSTRACT>
A base thermoplastic film has a coextruded or coated heat seal layer formed from a polymer blend which provides good peel-apart heat seals. When the film is sealed to itself, the seal opens by separation at the original seal surface without film tear, or by delamination of the sealant material from the primary HDPE film substrate without the formation of strands extending between the two base film. The heat seal layer which may be on one or both sides of the base layer comprises a ternary blend of a random ethylene-propylene copolymer, a butene polymer and a low density polyethylene. The films are cast, and oriented in the solid state up to about two times in the machine direction and six times or more in the transverse direction to give films having good dead-fold and water vapor transmission rate characteristics making them highly suited for packaging, particularly for dry foods.

<DESCRIPTION>
 HEAT SEAIABLE THERMOPLASTIC FILMSThis invention relates to heat sealable thermoplastic films.Thermoplastic films for use in packaging applications are typically provided with a heat-seal coating to allow the films to be heat sealed to themselves. Some heat seal coatings are, however, so aggressive that attempting to unseal a packaged film tends to destroy the package. With films that are unoriented or oriented to unbalanced extent, during separation of a sealed region, the films will tend to tear in the direction of least orientation. An ideal heat sealable film, therefore, is one which permits effective heat sealing of the film to itself while also permitting the seal to be easily peeled apart without destroying the film.It is an object of the present invention to provide such a heat-sealable film, which film when heat-sealed is readily peeled apart at the heat seal. There has now been discovered a film structure which can be heat-sealed effectively and yet unsealed by hand-force when desired. The film comprises a thermoplastic base layer coated with a ternary blend comprising a random ethylene-propylene polymer, a butene polymer and a low density polyethylene polymer. When the film is sealed to itself, the seal opens by separation at the original seal surface without film tear, or by delamination of the sealant material from the film substrate without the formation of strands of sealant extending between substrate surfaces.The contemplated base layers include polyethylene films, polypropylene films, polyester films such as polyethylene terephthalate films, and polyamide films. Polyethylene will be employed as exemplary of the contemplated films. While a high density polyethylene (HDPE) film will be used, it is also understood that. 

low density, medium density, linear low density polyethylenes and mixtures thereof may also be used.According to the present invention, the base film is provided with a heat seal layer which comprises a blend of three components which are formulated to ensure that each component is present in an amount which effectively interferes with the seal strength development of any other single component: a controlled seal strength is generated by the interaction of the three components, resulting in a heat seal which is strong enough to provide an adequate seal which can, however, be peeled apart without tearing the base film. Seal strengths of 100 to 500 grams per inch which permit ready peel-apart separation can be obtained with seal temperatures in the range of about 170° to
