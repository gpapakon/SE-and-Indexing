<ABSTRACT>
An elevator door hanger comprises a support (38) 
and a linkage (78,80) attaching to the door (18) and to 

the support. The linkage allows the door, to move in at 
least two axes as said door opens and closes. The 

linkage comprises a pair of rods (78) which maintain the 
door vertically as the door opens and closes. The 

linkage is disposed so that the door tends to close by 
gravity. The door rises as it opens and descends as it 

closes. The linkage may allow for motion in three axes 
if the door is curvilinear.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to elevator doors in 
general, and to elevator door support systems in 
particular. Elevators have doors that have been configured in 
basically the same ways for many years: each elevator 
car has one or more center or side opening doors to 
protect passengers as the car moves; and each landing 
has one or more hoistway doors that are configured 
similarly to the car doors to prevent passengers from 
entering the hoistway when the car is not at the 
landing. Some landings utilize a single hoistway door 
that pivots open and shut like a house door. Hoistway and car doors are supported similarly. 
The doors are suspended from their upper edges by 
rollers that travel longitudinally in a track attached 
to a lintel. The doors are guided at their bottom edges 
by gibs that slide in a slot in a sill. For safety reasons, hoistway doors are required to 
close automatically. A spring device maybe used to 
close the doors or a weight is attached to the doors by 
a cable that travels over a series of pulleys. The 
weight forces the doors to close unless there is a 
countervailing force. The hoistway and car doors are opened and closed by 
a door operating unit. The unit is disposed atop an 
elevator car and is attached to each car door via a 
complicated mechanical linkage. Each car door, in turn, 
is coupled, at the proper time, by a pair of rollers 
that clamp a vane attached to the hoistway doors. Viewed from one aspect the present invention 
provides apparatus for hanging a door comprising:
 
   a first coupling for allowing compound motion 
attached to a support,
 
 
   a second coupling for allowing compound motion 
attached to said door, and
 
   a support attaching to the first coupling and the 
second coupling, said couplings and said support 
cooperating to allow said door to ascend and descend 
while opening and closing. An advantage of the present invention, at least in 
its preferred forms, is that door rollers and tracks 
utilized in conventional hoistway door systems are 
eliminated. Rollers require frequent maintenance and 
repair and are also a source of unwelcome noise. Tracks 
are easily damaged and trap and accumulate dirt thereby 
impeding the travel of the rollers. A further advantage is that the cables, pulleys, 
and counterweights utilized in conventional hoistway 
door systems are eliminated. Two embodiments of the invention will now be 
described by way of example and with reference to the 
accompanying drawings, in which:-

Apparatus for hanging a door (18) comprising: 
   a first coupling (80) for allowing compound motion 

attached to a support (38), 
   a second coupling (80) for allowing compound motion 

attached to said door, and 
   a support (78) attaching to the first coupling and 

the second coupling, said couplings and said support 
cooperating to allow said door to ascend and descend 

while opening and closing. 
The apparatus of claim 1 wherein: 
   said first coupling (80) is disposed below said 

second coupling (80), and 
   said first coupling is offset from said second 

coupling so that said door (18) descends towards a 
closed position by gravity. 
The apparatus of claim 1 wherein: 
   said first coupling (80) is disposed above said 

second coupling (80), and is offset from said second 
coupling so that said door (18) descends towards a 

closed position by gravity. 
The apparatus of any of claims 1 to 3 wherein said 
support comprises: 

   a rod (78). 
The apparatus of claim 4 wherein said rod (78) is 
bent at an angle to allow entry without interference 

from said rod. 
The apparatus of any preceding claim wherein: 
   said door (18) has a curvilinear cross-section. 
Apparatus for hanging a door (18) comprising:
 

   a support (38),   a first linkage (78,80) attaching to said door and 
to said support, 

   a second linkage (78,80) attaching to said door and 
to said support, said first and second linkages allowing 

said door to move in at least two axes as said door 
opens and closes, said first and second linkage 

maintaining said door vertically as said door opens and 
closes. 
Apparatus for hanging a curvilinear door (18) 
comprising: 

   a support (38), 
   a linkage (78,80) attaching said door and said 

support, said linkage allowing said door to move in at 
least three axes as said door opens and closes. 
Apparatus for hanging a door (18) comprising: 
   a support (38), 

   a linkage (78,80) attaching to said door and to 
said support, said linkage allowing said door to move 

along at least two axes as said door opens and closes.
