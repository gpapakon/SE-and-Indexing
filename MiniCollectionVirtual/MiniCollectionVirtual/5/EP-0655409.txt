<ABSTRACT>
To determine thread winding parameters for 
reducing the rate at which deviations from a cylindrical 

shape are formed in thread packages being wound, thread 
packages (30) are successively formed by laying thread (32) upon 

a driven rotary chuck (14) while pressing a driven rotating 
contact roller (12) against the package (30) in a manner causing 

a circumferential force to be transmitted therebetween. 
Each package (30) is inspected for deviations from a 

cylindrical shape. The generation of slippage is promoted 
at an interface between the contact roller (12) and package (30). 

The amount of promoted slippage is changed between the 
forming of successive packages (30) to change the rate at which 

the deformations are formed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to developments in 
the filament winding system disclosed in U.S. 4,548,366 
(EP 182 389). U.S. Patent No. 4,548,366 discloses a winding 
arrangement in which a contact roller (in contact with the 
outer surface of a filament package) is driven to apply a 
controlled force to the package surface while the speed of 
rotation of the roller is regulated by regulating the 
speed of rotation of the package. U.S. Patent No. 4,765,552 (corresponding to 
European Publication 0 254 944) discloses limitation of 
the controlled force to a range given by a motor torque 
for the contact roller between 0 and 1.5 Newton-centimeter 
per filament package. This latter specification is 
unclear in its explanation of the quoted range but the 
justification appears to relate, either to avoidance of 
"small slips" which cause yarn quality variations or to 
avoidance of speed differentials giving tube damage at 
first contact of the roller with a bare bobbin tube. German Document 35 13 796 proposes a drive system 
in which the package is driven on its circumference by a 
friction drive roll while thread from a traverse motion is 
laid on the package by an additional contact roll. The 
contact roll is driven to give a slight excess speed of 
the contact roll relative to the package. This is 
designated to enable control of thread tension.  
 U.S. Patent 4,986,483 describes in some detail 
the problems discussed below (in the section "Problem 
Addressed") and proposes a combination of a drive system 
of the type discussed above with a special traverse cam 
device. The drive system is intended to be operated in 
a manner such as to avoid the transmission of 
circumferential force between the contact roller and the 
package for minimizing the generation of slip between the 
contact roller and the package. German Document 41 26 392 describes a system to 
apply feedback control to the generation of the motor 
torque for the contact roller. The generated motor torque 
is related directly to the circumferential force 
transferred between the roller and the package. The stated purpose of the arrangement according 
to German Document 41 26 392 is the achievement of control 
over the force transmitted at the interface between the 
roller and the package. By this means, slip at the 
interface is to be avoided. According to the German 
specification, slip is especially likely to occur when 
contact pressure is low and the system is subject to 
variations which risk an approach to or exceeding of the 
slip

A method of influencing winding tension in relation to 
delivery tension in the threadline (32) upstream from the 

winder in a winding arrangement in which a contact roller 
(20) in contact with the outer surface of a filament package 

(30) is driven to apply a controlled force to the package 
surface while the speed of rotation of the roller is 

regulated by regulating the speed of rotation of the 
package, the contact roller (20) being driven to apply a net 

force to the surface of the package 
(30) while the thread (32) to be wound is delivered from the 

contact roller (20) to the package surface after passing 
around a portion of the circumference of the contact roller 

(20) with a substantially predetermined angle of wrap (W) 
thereon, characterised in that rolling contact is generated 

between the contact roller (20) and the package (30) such 
that a controlled relationship is maintained between the 

rotation of the roller (20) and the rotation of the package 
(30) but such as to permit a small speed differential 

between the surface of the package (30) and the surface of 
the roller (20) thereby giving an effective change of thread 

tension between the threadline tension upstream of the 
roller (20) and downstream therefrom. 
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
speed differential is varied during the period of package 

build. 
A method according to Claim 2, characterised in that thread 
tension is reduced by means of a speed differential, the 

degree of reduction being reduced as package build proceeds. 
A method according to Claim 2, characterised in that thread 
tension is increased by means of a speed differential, the 

degree of increase being increased as package build 
proceeds. 
A method as claimed in any preceding claim, characterised in 
that the winding operation is controlled such that the level 

of slippage generated at the roller/package interface is

tension differential is such that no slippage arises between 

the yarn (32) and the surface of the contact roller (20)

speed of rotation of the contact roller (20) is regulated by 
regulating the speed of rotation of the package (30) and a 

circumferential force is transmitted between the contact 
roller (20) and the package (30), each package (30) being 

inspected for deviations from a cylindrical shape, and 
further characterised by the step of changing the amount of 

slippage generated at an interface between the contact 
roller (20) and package (30) to change the rate at which 

said deviations are formed.
