<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a planographic printing plate, and particularly to a planographic printing plate having a heat sensitive recording layer of heat-mode type, wherein recording is performed using heat generated by means of photothermal conversion of a laser beam into heat.Recently, in accordance with progress in image recording technology, much attention is being directed to a technique in which a printing plate is formed directly without using a film original. In this technique a printing plate is scanned by a finely focused laser beam and characters and images are directly formed on the plate.One of the examples of image recording materials in this field is what is called thermal type positive planographic printing plate. In this type of plate, an infrared absorbing agent in the photosensitive layer, by photothermal conversion action, generates heat by exposure and the generated heat causes exposed portion of the photosensitive layer to become soluble, resulting in formation of a positive image. Another example is a thermal type negative planographic printing plate. In this type of plate, firstly, the heat generated causes an acid to be formed by an acid generator or a radical to be formed by a radical generator. The acid or radical generated accelerates a radical polymerization reaction or an acid cross-linking reaction thereby forming insoluble portions and resulting in formation of negative images.In the thermal type image recording process of this kind, photothermal conversion materials in the photosensitive layer generate heat due to laser light irradiation. The heat generated causes an image recording reaction. However on a roughened surface of an aluminum support with anodic oxide coating, because the thermal conductivity of the support is extremely high compared to that of the photosensitive layer, the heat generated in the vicinity of the interface of the support of the photosensitive layer diffuses to the inside of the support before being sufficiently used for image recording. Consequently, the decomposition reaction of positive photosensitive layer at the interface of the support of the photosensitive layer is insufficient. Consequently a residual film is formed in portions that should have been non-image portion causing the fundamental e problem of low sensitivity.In order to deal with this problem, a variety of basecoats are being studied in order to improve developing property of the photosensitive layer in the vicinity of the interface of the support in positive type
