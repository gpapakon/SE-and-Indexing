<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a new silacyclohexane compound,
a method of preparing it, and a liquid crystal composition
which contains it as well as a liquid crystal display element
which contains said liquid crystal composition.A liquid crystal display element utilizes the optical anisotropy
and dielectric anisotropy of liquid crystal substances. Display
methods include the TN mode (twisted nematic mode), the STN
mode (super twisted nematic mode), the SBE mode (super birefringence effect
mode), the DS mode (dynamic scattering mode), the guest-host
mode, the DAP mode ("deformation of aligned phase" mode) and
the OMI mode (optical mode interference mode). The most common
display device has a twisted nematic structure based on the
Schadt-Helfrich mode.The properties required of the liquid crystal substance
used in these liquid crystal displays are somewhat different 
depending on the display method. However, a wide liquid crystal
temperature range and stability against moisture, air, light,
heat, electric fields, etc., are commonly required in all display
methods. Furthermore, it is desirable for the liquid crystal
material to have a low viscosity, and also to have a short
address time, low threshold voltage and high contrast in the
cell(s).Currently, there is no single compound which satisfies
all of these requirements. In practice, liquid crystal mixtures
are obtained by mixing several to more than ten liquid crystal
compounds and latent liquid crystal compounds. Because of
this, it is also important that components of a liquid crystal
composition mix easily.Among liquid crystal compounds which can be components
for these, one of the basic components conventionally known
which controls the electro-optical performance is a compound
which has a so-called cyclohexyl ring-phenyl ring-phenyl ring
structure (BCH structure) such as

EP 0 355 008 A2 discloses silylalkyl or silylalkenyl compounds including
a trialkylsilyl group or silacyclohexane group, a method of
preparing same, and their use in liquid crystal compositions.In recent years, along with the expansion of the applications
of liquid crystal displays, the characteristics required of
liquid crystal materials are becoming more and more advanced
and demanding. In particular, superior characteristics such
as improved low temperature performance, a wider temperature
range for automobile onboard use and a lower driving voltage,
compared with conventional liquid crystal
