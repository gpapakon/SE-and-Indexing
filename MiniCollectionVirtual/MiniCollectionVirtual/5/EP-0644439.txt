<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a long,
continuous, liquid crystalline polymer film oriented at a
desired angle which film is to be used for an optical
element such as a color compensator for a liquid crystal
display, a viewing angle compensator for a liquid crystal
display, a retardation plate, a half-wave plate, a
quarter-wave plate or an optical rotator and a method for its production.The present invention also relates to a long,
continuous, film-like laminate sheet including a liquid
crystalline polymer layer which sheet is to be used for an
optical element such as a color compensator for a liquid
crystal display, a viewing angle compensator for a liquid
crystal display, a retardation plate, a half-wave plate,
a quarter-wave plate or a rotator and a method for its production.Particularly, the invention relates to a long,
continuous, laminate sheet for an optical element which sheet
is a laminate of a liquid crystalline polymer layer and a
polarizing film layer, the liquid crystalline polymer layer
being oriented in a specific direction and a method for its production.The present invention can be used in
an optical element such as, for example, a color compensator
for a liquid crystal display, a viewing angle compensator 
for a liquid crystal display, a retardation plate, a
half-wave plate, a quarter-wave plate or an optical
rotator, as well as an optical element to be used for such
optical element.Conventional films for optical elements having
optical functions such as a color compensator for a liquid
crystal display, a viewing angle compensator for a liquid
crystal display, a retardation plate, a half-wave plate,
a quarter-wave plate and an optical rotator all
utilize uniaxially oriented films of polymers such as, for
example, polycarbonates and polyvinyl alcohols. Therefore,
the direction of the orientation is restricted by in which
direction the polymers are stretched. For example, in the
case of a long film, the orienting direction of the film is
inevitably limited corresponding to the stretched direction
of the film. One such arrangement is described in EP-A-0 465 133.In the case of use as a liquid crystal display
for example, the above situation has also been true of a
polarizing sheet which is often used in a laminated state to
the film for optical element mentioned above. The polarizing
sheet also utilizes a uniaxially stretched film of a polymer
such as a polyvinyl alcohol or a polyester, e.g. PET, with
iodine or a dichroic dye impregnated therein. Therefore,
its transmission axis

<CLAIMS>
A process for the production of an elongated film having a liquid crystalline
polymer layer applied to an elongated orienting substrate comprising:


(a) applying a rubbing treatment to the surface of an orienting substrate in
which treatment a rubbing roller is located adjacent to a section of the

orienting substrate and is obliquely orientated to the longitudinal axis of elongation of the
substrate so that when the substrate moves relative to the rubbing roller, the

rubbing roller affects the surface of the substrate in such a way as to promote
the oblique alignment of a liquid crystalline polymer subsequently applied to

the orienting substrate, and
(b) bringing a liquid crystal polymer into contact with the rubbed surface to form a layer
on said substrate

whereby the liquid crystal polymer is oriented according to the rubbed state
of the substrate.
A process as claimed in claim 1 wherein the predetermined oblique angle of
the rubbing roller is adjustable.
A process as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 wherein the liquid crystalline
polymer layer is transferred from the orienting substrate to a light transmitting

substrate through an adhesive layer to form a laminate.
A process as claimed in claim 3 wherein the adhesive layer is a curable
acrylic layer exhibiting optical isotropy.
A process as claimed in claim 4 which further comprises the step of curing
the curable acrylic layer. 
A process according to any of the preceding claims wherein the oriented
liquid crystal polymer film is provided with a protective layer formed of a curable

acrylic resin exhibiting optical isotropy.
A process as claimed in claim 6 which further comprises the step of curing
the curable acrylic layer.
A process as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein the liquid
crystalline polymer exhibits a uniform nematic or twisted nematic orientation in the

liquid crystalline state and a glassy state at a temperature below the liquid transition
temperature.
A process according to any of the preceding claims in which the elongated
film has a length of up to 10 000 metres.
A process as claimed in any of the preceding claims wherein the film or
laminate thus obtained is further affixed with a polarizing film constituted by a

uniaxially stretched polymer film through an adhesive layer.

pressure sensitive adhesive.
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 10 wherein the film or
laminate is cut into discrete lengths suitable for use as optical elements.
