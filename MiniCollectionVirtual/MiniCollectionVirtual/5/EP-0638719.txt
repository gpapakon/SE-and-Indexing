<ABSTRACT>
The object of the invention is to create a fuel pipe connection which is self-adjusting, can compensate for stresses occurring, especially due to temperature differences, is very easy to fit and detach and is easy and cheap to manufacture. As a solution it is proposed that the plain conduit (1) be arranged axially and angularly movable in the pump housing bore (2). The end piece of the plain conduit (1) opening into the pump housing bore (2) is radially widened and the widening (3) is provided with a seal face (4) on its outer circumference. In the pump housing bore (2) a recess is provided for accommodating a radial sealing element (6), the sealing element (6) being in contact with the seal face (4). The plain conduit (1) is detachably fixed by catch devices (8) in the area of the pump housing bore (2). The widening (3) in the area of the seal face (4) is of cylindrical form and the area in front of and behind the seal face (4) is of tapered design, the taper being conical or spherical.

Fuel line connection for fuel injection pumps, 
particularly of multi-cylinder diesel i.c. engines, 

comprising a fuel supply line in the form of a plain 
coupler (1), which is connected to the pump housing (5) 

and sealed by means of a sealing ring (6), the plain 
coupler (1) being guided in an axially and angularly 

movable manner in the pump housing bore (2), 
characterized in that the end piece of the plain coupler 

(1) which opens into the pump housing bore (2) is 
radially widened and the widened portion (3) is provided 

at its outer periphery with a sealing surface (4), and a 
recess for receiving the sealing ring (6) is provided in 

the pump housing bore (2), the sealing ring (6) being in 
contact with the sealing surface (4), and that the plain 

coupler (1) is detachably fastened in the region of the 
pump housing bore (2) by locking means (7, 8). 
Fuel line connection according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the widened portion (3) in the region of the 

sealing surface (4) is cylindrical and the region in 
front of and behind the sealing surface (4) is tapered. 
Fuel line connection according to claim 2, characterized 
in that the taper is conical or crowned. 
Fuel line connection according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the inside diameter of the plain 

coupler (1) in the region of the sealing surface (4) is 
such that, in the event of hydraulic internal loading of 

the plain coupler (1), a reduction of the sealing gap 
occurs. 
Fuel line connection according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the plain coupler (1) in the region  

 
of the plane surface adjacent to the pump housing bore 

(2) has a circumferential groove (7) for receiving a 
locking element (8). 
Fuel line connection according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that a recess (9) is provided as a 

disassembly aid in the region of the plane surface 
adjacent to the pump housing bore (2). 
Fuel line connection according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the length of the sealing surface 

(4) is greater than the axial displacements of the line 
connection which arise in the operating state. 
Fuel line connection according to one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the length of the pump housing bore 

(2) corresponds at least to the length of the axial 
displacement of the plain coupler (1) required for 

assembly or disassembly of the respective adjacent 
injection pumps.
