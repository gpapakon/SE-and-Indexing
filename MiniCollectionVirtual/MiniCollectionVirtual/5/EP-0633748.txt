<ABSTRACT>
The surgical treatment of stress urinary incontinence is disclosed. The disclosed methods include: 1) a technique of probe passage to avoid injuring the bladder and to provide a more accurate and reproducible capture of the pubocervical fascia lateral to the bladder neck and urethra, 2) anchor fixation of the suspending sutures to the pubic bone to decrease the risk of suture pull through from above and to decrease post-operative pain and 3) a simple and reproducible technique to set a limited tension of the suspending sutures. A description of these methods and results of procedures with some of these methods are disclosed. Novel drill guides, suture passers, suture tensioners, surgical drapes, and support for use in the surgical method are also disclosed. The drill guide comprises a housing with an axially movable probe and a drill guide channel.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the treatment of stress
urinary incontinence "SUI," and, in particular, to an improved
bone anchor implantation device for the surgical treatment of SUI
in females.Genuine stress incontinence is the involuntary loss of
urine due to a sudden rise in intra-abdominal pressure. It
has been estimated that between 40% and 50% of young, healthy
nulliparous women admit to occasional mild stress
incontinence; however, at least 80% of stress incontinence
patients are in the perimenopausal age group and are
multiparous. Raz3 has suggested that the female urethral
continence mechanism is dependent on the interaction of four
urethral factor: urethral closing pressure, urethral length,
urethrotrigonal anatomy, and urethral reception of intra-abdominal
pressure.The urethral closing pressure is predominantly a result
of the interaction of smooth and striated muscle sphincter
activity, but there is also some contribution by nonmuscular
urethral factors such as the submucosal vascular plexus, the
elastin and collagen content of the urethral tissues, and a
sphincter like effect of the mucosa. There has been
considerable diversity of opinion regarding the anatomic
structure and the innervation of the urethral sphincters, and
a variety of views have been expressed in the literature.Lapides and associates have stressed the importance of
urethral length in the maintenance of continence in the
female. However, although it certainly interacts with other
factors to contribute to continence, a short urethra alone
will not produce incontinence. Urethral length varies
considerably in normal women, and women with proven genuine
stress urinary incontinence do not invariably have urethral
shortening. Urethrotrigonal anatomy, which can be demonstrated by
lateral cystourethrography, should fulfill certain criteria.
The bladder base should lie above the level of the inferior
ramus of the symphysis, and with straining should not descend
more than 1.5 cm. There should be a normal urethrotrigonal
alignment with an angle normally less than 100 degrees, and
the urethral axis should be approximately 35 degrees from the
vertical. In the hypermobile situation loss of all of the
normal anatomic features may occur, a radiologic finding that
correlates with the clinical finding of cystourethrocele.
However, clinical experience has shown that the coexistence of
cystourethrocele and incontinence does not predict that the
incontinence is of a genuine stress variety.The transmission of intra-abdominal pressure to the
