<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of esters of L-carnitine 
and acyl L-carnitine with hydroxyacids for 
producing pharmaceutical compositions which contain such 
esters as active ingredients, suitable to be topically 
applied for the treatment of dermatoses. 
The compounds useful according to the invention 
are the esters of the following 
hydroxyacids: 
α - hydroxybutyric acid α - hydroxyisobutyric acid β - hydroxybutyric acid γ - hydroxybutyric acid α - hydroxyisocaproic acid α - hydroxyisovaleric acid malic acid, and tartronic acid. The acyl group is C1-5 alkanoyl, 
selected from acetyl, propionyl, butyryl, isobutyryl, 
valeryl and isovaleryl. Encompassed by the compounds to be used according to 
the present invention are both the inner salts and the 
salts of the aforesaid esters with pharmacologically  
 
acceptable acids. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, 
in addition to the inner salts, all 
pharmaceutically acceptable salts which are prepared 
by the addition of acid to L-carnitine, and which do not 
give rise to undesirable toxic or collateral effects. 
The formation of pharmaceutically acceptable acid 
addition salts is well known in pharmaceutical 
technology. Non-limiting examples of suitable salts include the 
chloride, bromide, orotate, acid aspartate, acid 
citrate, acid phosphate, fumarate, acid fumarate, 
lactate, maleate, acid maleate, acid oxalate, acid 
sulfate, glucose phosphate, tartrate and acid tartrate 
salts. The esters of L-carnitine and the aforesaid alkanoyl L-carnitine 
with β-hydroxybutyric acid and the 
pharmacologically acceptable salts thereof are known 
compounds. For instance, EP 0443996 A1 discloses the activity of 
these esters in inhibiting neuronal degeneration (as it 
occurs e.g. in Alzheimer's dementia and Parkinson's 
disease) and liver proteolysis and in the treatment of 
coma. Also the esters of L-carnitine and the aforesaid  
 
alkanoyl L-carnitine with γ-hydroxybutyric acid and the 
pharmacologically acceptable salts thereof are known 
compounds (see e.g. EP-A-429403 and EP-A-442850). 
These esters are endowed with the same pharmacological 
properties as the β-hydroxybutyric acid esters. On the other hand, the esters of L-carnitine and 
aforesaid alkanoyl L-carnitines with hydroxyacids other 
than β- and γ-hydroxybutyric acid are novel compounds. 
Their preparation can be carried out similarly to that 
of the known esters which is disclosed in the aforesaid 
European patent applications with only slight 
modifications which, depending on the
