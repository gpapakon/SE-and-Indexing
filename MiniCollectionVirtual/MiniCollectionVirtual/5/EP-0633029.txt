<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides A conjugate comprising (a) an antibody selected 
from antibody A5B7 and antibody SB10; linked to (b) an enzyme selected from 

carboxypeptidase G2 (CPG2) and nitroreductase. The invention can be used in a system 
which comprises i) a humanised antibody to tumour associated antigen linked to a member 

of the group consisting of a human enzyme, a non-human enzyme rendered non-immunogenic 
in man and a humanised catalytic antibody and ii) a prodrug convertible under the influence 

of i) into a cytotoxic drug.

<DESCRIPTION>
THIS INVENTION relates to systems for the control of 
neoplastic cell growth and is particularly concerned with 
systems involving the localisation of cytotoxic agents at 
tumour sites. In our earlier Patent Application PCT/GB88/00181 (WO 
88/07378) we disclose a two-component system which 
comprises 
(i) a first component (Component A-E) that is an 
antibody fragment capable of binding with a tumour 
associated antigen, the antibody fragment being bound to an 
enzyme capable of converting a prodrug into a cytotoxic 
drug; (ii) a second or final component (Component PD) that 
is a prodrug convertible under the influence of the enzyme 
to a cytotoxic drug (CD). In our earlier PCT Patent Application and in this 
present Patent Application, the word 'tumour' is to be 
understood as referring to all forms of neoplastic cell 
growth including carcinomas, sarcomas, lymphomas and 
leukaemias. The present invention provides a two component system 
which comprises: 
i) a conjugate comprising 
(a) an antibody selected from antibody A5B7 and 
antibody SB10; linked to (b) an enzyme selected from carboxypeptidase G2 
(CPG2) and nitroreductase; and ii) a prodrug convertible under the influence of the  
 
conjugate into a cytotoxic drug. The conjugate itself also forms part of the invention. 
A preferred conjugate comprises A5B7 antibody linked to 
CPG2 enzyme. As described in our above-mentioned copending 
International Patent Application PCT/GB88/00181, the 
prodrug can be benzoic acid mustard glutamide that converts 
to benzoic acid mustard [p-(bis-2-choloroethyl)amino] 
benzoic acid under the influence of a carboxypeptidase. 
However, the principles of this invention are equally 
applicable to other prodrugs releasing benzoic acid mustard 
or analogues thereof or other cytotoxic drugs, in which the 
structural feature distinguishing the prodrug from the 
cytotoxic drug is removed by CPG2 or nitroreductase. The antibody can be whole antibody or one of the 
antibody fragments, e.g. antibody lacking an Fc portion, 
F(ab')2 or other fragment as described in our above-mentioned 
earlier filed International Patent Application. 
The function of the antibody is to assist in the 
localisation of the enzyme in the region of the tumour to 
be treated. The antibody or fragment thereof may be conjugated 
directly, or indirectly through a linking component, to the 
enzyme. The conjugation can be effected by chemical 
bonding. Alternatively, a conjugate wherein the antibody 
is linked to the enzyme via a continuous polypeptide
