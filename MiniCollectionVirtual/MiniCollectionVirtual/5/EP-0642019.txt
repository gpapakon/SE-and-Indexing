<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed herein is a method of sequentially and 
continuously determining the concentrations of carbon, 

hydrogen, and nitrogen in molten steel using a single 
apparatus. Disclosed also herein are a method and an 

apparatus for determining trace amounts of carbon in molten 
steel which are the specialized application of the principle 

used for the above-mentioned method. 
 
Said method comprises bubbling through molten steel a 
carrier gas selected according to any specific element to be 

determined in molten steel, recovering the carrier gas 
containing the specific element, circulating or passing the 

recovered carrier gas through a gas circulating circuit so 
that the concentration of th
e specific element in the 
carrier gas reaches an approximate or complete equilibrium 

with the concentration of the specific element in molten 
steel, determining the concentration of the specific element 

by the means to determine the concentration of one or more 
specific elements, (and in the case of determination of 

several elements) discharging the carrier gas from the gas 
circulating circuit and repeating said steps with a renewed 

carrier gas to determine the remaining elements to be 
determined.

<DESCRIPTION>
The first aspect of the present invention relates to a 
method and apparatus for sequentially and continuously 
determining the concentrations of carbon, hydrogen, and 
nitrogen in molten steel. The second aspect of the present invention relates to 
a method and apparatus for rapidly determining trace amounts 
of carbon in molten steel with no deoxidation or slight 
deoxidation. The method and apparatus in the second aspect 
are basically the same as those in the first aspect. More 
particularly, the second aspect of the present invention 
relates to a method and apparatus for rapidly and accurately 
determining trace amounts of carbon which could not be 
determined directly by the conventional method. The method 
and apparatus can be effectively used when dissolved carbon 
is removed from molten steel with no deoxidation or slight 
deoxidation using a vacuum decarburizing unit such as RH 
degassing unit.  It is of the utmost importance in a steel mill to 
control the concentrations of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen 
in molten steel. In fact, it is necessary to control the 
concentrations of either nitrogen and hydrogen or either 
nitrogen and carbon, depending on the refinery involved. Of 
these three elements, carbon has recently become a matter of 
great concern. Especially, the determination of carbon 
concentrations in ultralow carbon steel sheet is attracting 
considerable attention. The reason for this is explained 
below. Ultralow carbon steel sheet has been widely in use 
mainly for automobiles. As compared with low carbon steel, 
it is superior in ductility and deep-drawability. On the 
other hand, it suffers a disadvantage of lacking sufficient 
mechanical strength. Therefore, many attempts have been 
made to improve its mechanical strength while maintaining 
its ductility. This object is achieved by, for example, 
adding any one or two of such elements as Ti, Nb, Mn, and P. 
Another important factor to be considered is to control 
trace amounts of carbon. If it is possible to control trace 
amounts of carbon, it would be possible to reduce the kinds 
and amount of additives. For this reason, there is a demand 
in the steel making industry for a technique to control the 
concentration of trace amounts of carbon to a precision of  
 
the order of ppm in molten steel containing 10-100 ppm of 
carbon. The process for producing ultralow carbon steel in a 
steel mill involves the use of a vacuum decarburizing unit 
(typified by RH degassing unit). According to this process, 
decarburization is
