<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of an optical information carrier comprising a 
substrate (1), an auxiliary layer (3) bounded by dielectric layers (2 and 4), a thin 

reflection layer (5), a dielectric layer (7), a phase-change layer (9), a dielectric layer 
(11), a tight metal reflection layer (13) and a protective layer (13). The information 

carrier is recordable and erasable by a laser-light beam a and can be played in a 
conventional CD player. The auxiliary layer (3) consists of selenium or AlGaAs. Said 

auxiliary layer has the property that the absorption increases substantially at 
temperatures above 70°C. Thus, a information carrier comprising said auxiliary layer 

can be recorded with a lower laser power as compared to a information carrier which 

does not comprise said auxiliary layer (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an optical information carrier for inscribing, 
reading and erasing information by means of a laser-light beam, said optical information 
carrier comprising a transparent substrate having a servotrack and a stack of layers, 
which stack comprises at least one recording layer of a phase-change material and at 
least one reflection layer of metal. Known optical information carriers, such as the Compact Disc (CD), 
Compact Disc Read-Only-Memory (CD-ROM) and Laser Vision (LV) are provided with 
information by the manufacturer and can only be read by the user by means of 
commercially available playback quipment. Other information carriers can be recorded 
once (CD-R) by the user. A information carrier which is recordable and erasable by the 
user and which is readable in a standard CD player could be used for many 
applications. A special recording/erase device is used for recording and erasing. Audio 
or data information can be recorded in the information carrier by the user himself. After 
an erasing step, new information can be recorded in the information carrier. A prerequisite for reading a recordable and erasable information carrier in 
a standard CD player is that said information carrier is compatible with said CD player, 
i.e. it must comply with the industrial standard for CD systems, hereinafter referred to 
as CD-industrial standard. This means, among other things, that the reflection RH of 
unrecorded areas of the information carrier and the modulation must have a specific 
minimum value. When a recorded information carrier is read by means of a focused 
laser-light beam, reflection differences and/or optical path-length differences bring about 
a modulated laser-light beam which is subsequently converted by a detector into a 
modulated photocurrent in accordance with the coded, recorded digital information. The 
modulated photocurrent is a HF signal whose lowest fundamental frequency is 196 kHz. 
The peak-to-peak value of the photocurrent is designated I₁₁ and the top level of the HF 
signal associated with 196 kHz is designated Itop. The modulation is defined as I₁₁/Itop 
and must be at least 0.6 according to the above-mentioned CD-industrial standard. The 
modulated photocurrent is caused by reflection differences and/or optical path-length  
 
differences between recorded and unrecorded areas of the information carrier. 
Information carriers whose modulation is based only on reflection differences must have 
a minimal optical contrast in order to attain the required
