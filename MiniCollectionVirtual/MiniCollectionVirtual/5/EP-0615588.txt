<ABSTRACT>
A hydrostatic transmission has at least one hydropump (1) and at least one adjustable hydromotor (2) coupled to two work lines (17, 18) of which at least one leads to the hydropump, as well as a regulating member (8) regulatable between two regulating range limits for regulating the displacement volume of the hydromotor. The regulating range limits for regulating the hydromotor correspond to a minimum and to a maximum displacement volume. In order to be able to adapt the braking effect obtainable with the hydrostatic transmission to various conditions of use, a positioning arrangement (10) controllable by a regulating signal adjusts at least one of the regulating range limits and a control arrangement (11) adjusts the regulating signal during the override condition of the hydrostatic transmission. In order to increase the braking effect, the positioning arrangement (10) adjusts the adjustable regulating range limit so as to increase the displacement volume of the hydromotor (2).
