<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a plate type
integrated optical device using a zigzag optical path,
and particularly to an optical device in which an
oblique incident angle of a semiconductor laser chip
can accurately be set.In an integrated optical device having a
plate shape (plate type optical integrated circuit),
optical elements are integrated on a transparent plate
(substrate), an optical path is formed in a zigzag
manner by utilizing reflections between the interfaces
of the plate so that the optical elements are connected
with each other, and optical information processing is
conducted. This circuit configuration has been utilized
because it can allow an optical application
system to be miniaturized, stabilized, and lightened.Figure 6A and Figure 6B show an example of an
optical device using a conventional plate type optical
integrated circuit system (Teruhiro Shiono et al.,
Japanese patent application No. 3-77527).The optical device shown in Figure 6A and
Figure 6B, is an example of an optical head for reading
out signals from an optical recording device such as a
compact disk (CD), an optical disk, or an optical card
memory. In the conventional optical device, light
which is obliquely emitted from a semiconductor laser
chip 1 disposed on the back face of a transparent
substrate 2 travels as propagation light 8 and enters a
reflection collimator lens 3' to be reflected and
collimated. The collimated light propagates in a
zigzag manner, and then is obliquely converged and is
output to an optical disk 7 as emitted light 9 by a
transmission objective lens 4a disposed on the surface
of the transparent substrate 2. Light 10 reflected
from the optical disk 7 enters a second transmission
objective lens 4b disposed on the surface of the transparent
substrate 2, and is collimated to become propagation
light 8'. The propagation light 8' propagates
in a zigzag manner and enters a reflection twin lens 5'
which is a signal detecting element (focus/track error
signal detection means) formed on the surface of the
transparent substrate 2. The propagation light 8' is
split into two parts by the lens 5' and converged into
a four-split optical detector 6 disposed on the back
face of the transparent substrate 2. The four-split
optical detector 6 outputs signals corresponding to the
input light. The signals output from the optical
detector 6, are a reproduced signal, a focus error
signal, and a track error signal, both the focus error
signal and the track error signal are positioning
signals.In the conventional
