<ABSTRACT>
Arrangement for optically coupling a planar optical waveguide and an optical fibre, and methods for the production of a planar waveguide suitable for such an arrangement. A known arrangement for optically coupling a planar optical waveguide, integrated on a substrate, and an optical fibre has in the substrate a ditch-like depression (groove) which leads to an end surface of the waveguide and in which the fibre is fastened. This depression must be produced with high precision. Such an arrangement is to be provided in which the depression does not need to be dimensioned with high precision. For this purpose, the fibre (3) is fastened on a separate holding part (7) between two level surfaces (8, 9), lying in a joint plane (89) and is placed with these surfaces (8, 9) on level surfaces, lying in a joint plane, of the substrate, between which surfaces the ditch-like depression is formed. The fibre (3) is then arranged with play in the depression which is dimensioned with a sufficient size. Use in bidirectional optical transceiver modules.
