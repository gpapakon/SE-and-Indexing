<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a method for monitoring water, in particular boiler feed water in regard to organic contamination by measuring conductivity, the test water flow is branched into a partial flow and the conductivity is measured. The other partial flow is evaporated at 300-500 DEG C, the water vapour (steam) is thermally treated at temperatures of 800-1000 DEG C, the treated water vapour is condensed, the conductivity of the condensate is measured and the difference between the measured conductivities is taken.

<CLAIMS>
A process for monitoring water, in particular boiler
feed water, for organic impurities by measuring the

conductivity, which comprises diverting a part
stream from a sample water stream and measuring the

conductivity, evaporating the other part stream at
300-500°C, treating the steam thermally at temperatures

of 800-1000°C, condensing the treated steam,
measuring the conductivity of the condensate and

taking the difference between the measured conductivities.
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein after
condensing the steam any gas present is separated

off and condensate and gas are fed separately.
The process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the
sample water stream is passed through an ion exchanger

before division.
A device for carrying out the process as claimed in
claim 1, wherein two conductivity measuring cells

(6, 13) are connected at the outlet of a sample water stream
divider (2), an evaporator (8), a reactor (9) and a

condenser (10) being arranged in series connection
between the sample water stream divider (2) and one

of the conductivity measuring cells (6, 13) in the
measuring cell direction, and the measuring cells

(6, 13) being connected to an electronic measurement
processing arrangement (14).
The device as claimed in claim 4, wherein a gas
separator (12) is connected at the outlet of the

condenser (10).
The device as claimed in claim 4 or 5, wherein a
steam baffle (17) is connected in series with the

evaporator (8). 
The device as claimed in claim 4, wherein an ion
exchanger (1) is connected in series with the sample

water stream divider (2).
The device as claimed in claim 4, wherein feed
arrangements (7, 11) for the sample water part

streams are connected at the outlet of the measuring cells
(6, 13).
