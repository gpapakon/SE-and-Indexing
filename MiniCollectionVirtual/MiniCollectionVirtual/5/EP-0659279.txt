<ABSTRACT>
In a method for detecting luminous objects, an image is formed on a zone (10) between two planes by means of a light source (241). An image is then formed of the luminous object and the light from the image is converted to an electrical quantity which is transmitted as functional information. The device comprises an optical light detection system comprising an adjustable focus lens, a photoelectric transducer (3), a converter (2), a comparator (5), a buffer stage (6), a power supply (7) and a light source (241). Application in detecting jets of molten metal.

Device for detecting the arrival of a stream of liquid 
metal, of the type comprising, mounted in a casing, a system, 

especially an optical system, for detecting the light coming from 
an observed zone included between at least two secant planes 

(12, 13), this system including an adjustable-focus lens and on 
an electronic card (1) a converter (2) electrically connected to 

a photoelectric transducer (3), said converter (2) being 
connected to a comparator (5), itself connected to a buffer stage 

(6), the converter, the comparator and the buffer stage being 
connected to a supply (7), characterised in that said device also 

comprising a light source (241), the electronic card (1) being 
situated between the zone (10) of detection of the passage of the 

stream of liquid metal and the light source (241), at least one 
rectangular opening is formed in the electronic card (1) and 

cooperates with the photoelectric transducer (3), having the 
shape of the utilised zone of the image of the observed object, 

that is to say rectangular, the opening of the electronic card 
(1) being adapted to be traversed by the rays of the light source 

(241) so as to materialise the zone of detection by the formation 
of a real image of the opening (102, 103), the rays of the light 

source (241), after traversing the opening, passing through the 
same optical system as the detected light. 
Devioe according to Claim 1, including a proportional 
current generator (104) for transmitting continuous functional 

information proportional to the current emitted by the transducer 
(3). 
Device according to Claim 1, in which the through opening 
is adjacent to the photoelectric transducer (3). 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 3, in which a 
thermal safety means is connected to the light source (241). 
Device according to Claim 4, characterised in that the 
thermal safety means consists of a sensor for converting the 

temperature into an electrical signal, a means supplying a 
reference of the threshold value of the electrical signal, a 

threshold comparator and a relay, the sensor for converting the  
 

temperature into an electrical signal and the means supplying a 
reference of the threshold value of the electrical signal each 

being connected to an input of the comparator, the relay being 
connected to the output of the threshold comparator via a buffer 

stage, and to the light source. 
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 5, in which 
the hollow cover (230) containing the light source (241) has a 

cooling means (231), in particular fins. 
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 6, in which 
the light source (241) consists of a halogen lamp and of a 

thermal filter so as to transmit only the cold light. 
Use of the device according to any one of Claims 1 to 7 
for the detection of the arrival of the first drop of a stream 

of liquid metal coming from a pouring ladle via a pouring lip of 
large width for obtaining metal parts of consistent weight.
