<ABSTRACT>
A tubular prosthesis device (10) for use within the body. The device (10) includes, a metal filament (11) material formed of metal outer member (4) having an exposed outer surface and a core (8) within the extended outer member formed of a different metal than the outer member. The core (8) is secured within and substantially enclosed by the outer member (10). The device can be reduced to a small size for introduction into the body lumen and expandable to a sufficiently large size to engage the wall of the body lumen. Stents (10) formed of composite wires (11) are shown.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to tubular endoprostheses
to be used inside the body.Tubular endoprostheses such as medical stents are
placed within the body to perform a function such as
maintaining a body lumen open, for example, a passageway
occluded by a tumor or a blood vessel restricted by
plaque. Tubular endoprostheses in the form of grafts are
used to substitute for or reinforce a lumen, such as the
aorta or other blood vessels which have been weakened,
e.g., by an aneurysm.
   Typically, these endoprostheses are delivered
inside the body by a catheter that supports the device in
a compacted or otherwise reduced-size form as it is
transported to the desired site. The size is
particularly small when a percutaneous insertion
technique is employed. Upon reaching the site, the
endoprosthesis is expanded so that it engages the walls
of the lumen.
   The expansion mechanism may involve forcing the
endoprosthesis to expand radially outwardly, for example,
by inflation of a balloon carried by the catheter, to
plastically deform and fix the device at a predetermined
expanded position in contact with the lumen wall. The
expanding means, the balloon, can then be deflated and
the catheter removed.
   In another technique, the endoprosthesis is formed
of a highly elastic material that can be reversibly
compacted and expanded. During introduction into the
body, the endoprosthesis is restrained in the compacted
condition and upon reaching the desired site for
implantation, the restraint is removed, enabling the 
device to self-expand by its own internal elastic restoring force.In many cases, x-ray fluoroscopy is used to view an
endoprosthesis within the body cavity to monitor placement and operation.
The device may also be viewed by x-ray film after placement for medical
follow-up evaluation. To date, the requirement for radiopacity has limited the
construction of devices to certain materials which in turn has limited the
features attainable for particular applications and the available insertion
techniques.US-A-4768507 discloses the use of a coil spring intravascular stent for
preventing arterial restenosis following balloon angioplasty. The stent may be
formed from a stainless spring steel, or an alloy of titanium, such as
Ti-6A1-4V.EP-A-0433011 discloses an improvement to the stent of US-A-4768507,
in which the stent comprises or is constructed of a material that is
radioactive, and thereby which acts to reduce the proliferation of rapidly
growing cells to inhibit intimal hyperplasia. In one embodiment, the stent

A tubular medical stent formed of a metal wire (11) composed of a core (8) and
a sheath (4) intimately surrounding the core (8), the core (8) being formed of a first

metal and the sheath (4) being formed of a second metal, the
stent being adapted to be subjected to elastic deformation to enable the device to be

forced into a characteristic deformed configuration during a stage of use and to

elastically self-recover from the deformation when deformation forces are released,

selected thickness whereby the combined effect of the selected thicknesses serves
