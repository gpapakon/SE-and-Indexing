<ABSTRACT>
In an optical fiber coil arrangement for use in rotation sensors, for example, errors resulting from axial and/or radial time varying temperature gradients can be minimized or substantially eliminated by employing reverse quadrupoles for the sensor coil. One of the quadrupoles is wound in a + - - + winding configuration. However, the next adjacent quadrupole is wound in a - + + - winding configuration. This reverse quadrupole arrangement substantially eliminates radial time varying temperature gradient dependent errors and reduces axial time varying temperature gradient dependent errors. The axial time varying temperature gradient dependent errors can be substantially eliminated by winding a reverse octupole arrangement. Accordingly, a reverse octupole arrangement is wound with a + - - + - + + - - + + - + - - + winding configuration. Alternatively, the axial time varying temperature gradient dependent errors can be substantially eliminated by providing extra lengths of the "+" and "-" ends which are axially displaced so as to substantially eliminate this axial time varying temperature gradient dependent error.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to fiber optic coils and, more particularly, to fiber optic 
coils used in rotation sensors, as may be used for an advanced global positioning and inertial 
guidance system. Optical rotation sensing devices include ring 
laser gyros, fiber optic rotation sensors, and the 
like. The fiber optic rotation sensor ordinarily used 
comprises an interferometer which includes a light 
source, a beam splitter, a detector, and a light path 
which is mounted on a rotatable platform. Light from 
the light source is split by the beam splitter into two 
beams which are directed to opposite ends of the 
optical path and which then counterpropagate around 
that path. The light beams exit the light path, the 
light beams are recombined, and the resulting combined 
light beam is sensed by a detector. A sensing circuit 
connected to the detector determines any phase 
difference between the counterpropagating light beams. Assuming that this fiber optic rotation 
sensor experiences no rotation, ideally no difference  
 
in phase between the counterpropagating light beams 
will be detected. On the other hand, if the sensor 
experiences rotation, there will be a phase difference 
between the counterpropagating light beams which can be 
detected to indicate the extent and direction of 
rotation. In a fiber optic rotation sensor, an optical 
fiber is coiled, usually in multiple layers, around a 
spool, with each layer containing multiple turns. 
Currently, such coils are typically wound as 
quadrupoles. In order to form a quadrupole coil, each 
half of a continuous optical fiber is first wound onto 
respective intermediate spools. The first spool is 
then used to wind a first layer of turns in a clockwise 
direction around a sensor spool. This first layer is 
wound around the sensor spool from the first end to the 
second end of the sensor spool. The second spool is 
then used to wind a second layer of turns in a counter-clockwise 
direction around a sensor spool. This second 
layer is wound around the sensor spool from the first 
end to the second end of the sensor spool. The fiber 
on the second spool is then wound back from the second 
end to the first end of the sensor spool to form a 
third layer. The first spool is then used to wind a 
fourth layer of turns from the second end of the spool 
to the first end. Thus, one half (i.e. one end) of the 
optical fiber is used to form the first and fourth 
layers of turns and the other half (i.e. the other end) 
is used to form the second and third
