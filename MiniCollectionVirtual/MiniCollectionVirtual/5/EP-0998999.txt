<ABSTRACT>
A reactor vessel (1) suitable for use in the reclamation of foundry sand
comprises a vessel (1) having an integral upper tubular portion (2) and a

lower depending frustoconical portion (3). The reactor vessel is contained
within an insulating frame (6) supported by legs (7) and provided with a

lid (8). The vessel is provided with diametrically opposed sand inlet (16)
and sand outlet ports (21) and at least one outlet port (26) for gaseous

impurities. Means are provided to fluidise the sand within the reactor
vessel (1) comprising a series of oxygen containing gas inlet nozzles (31).

The vessel (1) is provided with an indirect heater to heat the sand to a
predetermined temperature.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to apparatus for use in the reclamation of
used foundry sand.Increased costs, disposal problems and environmental issues associated
with the disposal of used foundry sand have made it more desirable to
reuse the foundry sand. The sand from foundry processes is usually
mixed with resins, binders, dust, metallic particles and the other
impurities and must therefore be reclaimed from the sand/impurity
mixture before it can be reused.Methods and apparatus for reclamation of foundry sand are known in the
art, however they often have associated maintenance problems and are not
particularly efficient. For example it is known to heat the foundry sand to
burn off the impurities by feeding combustible gases into a reactor vessel
containing foundry sand and igniting the gas to give direct heating of the
sand. This method of heating often causes hot spots to develop
particularly around the gas inlet ports. At such hot spots the sand may
form a glass like substance which can block the gas inlet ports leading to
a decrease in the efficiency of the apparatus.Sand reclamation apparatus generally require the sand bed to be fluidised,
however, the shape of the reactor vessel and lack of adequate fluidising
gas pressure, e.g. through blockage of gas inlet ports leads to poor
fluidisation. For maintenance purposes it is desirable to be able to empty the reactor
vessel, however the design of many of the prior art reactors does not
allow the sand to be readily moved therefrom.It is known for weld cracks to occur in prior art reactor vessels tightly
contained within a frame as a result of expansion on heating.
Furthermore, prior art designs of foundry sand reactor vessels and frames
do not always provide for easy removal of the reactor vessel from the
frame for the replacement or cleaning thereof.The object of the present invention is therefore to provide an apparatus
for reclamation of used foundry sand which is efficient and easy to
maintain and which addresses the problems associated with prior art
designs.According to a first aspect the present invention provides a reactor vessel
adapted for use in the reclamation of foundry sand the vessel having an
open end and a closed end, inlet and outlet ports for sand, at least one
outlet port for gaseous impurities, means to fluidise the sand within the
reactor vessel and means provided within the vessel to heat the sand to a
predetermined temperature wherein the means to heat the sand to a
predetermined temperature comprises an indirect heater.The

<CLAIMS>
A reactor vessel (1) adapted for use in the reclamation of foundry
sand the vessel (1) having an open end and a closed end, inlet (16) and

outlet ports (21) for sand, at least one outlet port (26) for gaseous
impurities, means to fluidise the sand within the reactor vessel (1) and

means provided within the vessel to heat the sand to a predetermined
temperature wherein the means to heat the sand to a predetermined

temperature comprises an indirect heater.
A vessel according to Claim 1 which comprises an integral upper
tubular portion (2) and a lower depending frustoconical portion (3).
A vessel (1) according to Claim 2 wherein the means to create a
fluidised bed comprises a series of oxygen containing gas inlet nozzles

(31) provided in the wall of the frustoconical lower portion (3) of the
reactor (1).
A vessel (1) according to Claim 3 wherein the nozzles (31) are at
right angles to the wall of the frustoconical portion (3).
A vessel (1) according to Claim 3 wherein the nozzles (31) are
directed around the circumference of the frustoconical portion (3) and

inclined at an angle of 30° - 60° thereto.
A vessel (1) according to any one of Claims 3-5 wherein the
nozzles (31) have individual gas supply lines (32).
A vessel (1) according to Claim 6 wherein valve means are
provided so that each nozzle (31) can be opened or closed in isolation.
A vessel according to any preceding claim wherein the heater
includes a heating element (25) comprising a hollow metal tube extending

into the vessel (1) having an inlet for hot gases from a burner located
externally of the vessel and an outlet for exhaust gases (26).
A vessel (1) according to any preceding claim wherein the sand
inlet port (16) exits into the vessel above a series of substantially vertical

deflector plates (18 and 18a).
