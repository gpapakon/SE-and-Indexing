<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a plate heat exchanger, especially an oil/coolant cooler having trough-shaped heat exchanger plates which are stacked one above the other and whose circumferential rims bear against one another and are sealingly soldered to one another. All the heat exchanger plates are of the same shape. As a result of using specially designed shapes in which turbulence-generating elevations or sealing stampings are worked into the heat exchanger plates, the number of inserts (internals), e.g. turbulence inlays or sealing washers, is reduced further.

A plate heat exchanger, particularly an oil/coolant radiator for internal combustion
engines, consisting of a plurality of trough-shaped heat exchanger plates stacked

one upon another, with an encircling edge, an end plate with connecting unions
for the supply and discharge of a first fluid and with further connecting unions for

the supply and discharge of a second fluid, whereby the encircling edge of one
heat exchanger plate bears on the encircling edge of the adjacent heat exchanger

plate or on the edge of the end plate and is connected thereto in sealing-tight
manner by a jointing procedure, particularly by being soldered, characterised in

that

a) all the heat exchanger plates (3, 23, 43) of the plate heat exchanger (1)
are of rectangular construction and are of the same shape,
b) each heat exchanger plate (3, 23, 43) has four apertures (26, 27,; 46, 47)
which form ports for the first and for the second fluid and are in each case

connected to four connecting unions (8, 8; 9, 9),
c) in each case two apertures (26, 46) on one side are provided with pressed-out
portions (25, 45) which are disposed in a circle around the apertures

(26, 46) and
d) in that adjacent heat exchanger plates (3, 23, 43) are respectively rotated
through 180Â° about the vertical axis.
A plate heat exchanger according to claim 1, characterised in that there are
turbulence baffles (4, 4') and annular sealing discs (5) in the heat exchanger plates

(3), a heat exchanger plate (3) with a turbulence baffle (4) for the first fluid and
two sealing discs (5) and a heat exchanger plate (3) with a turbulence baffle ((4')

for the second fluid and having two sealing discs (5) are stacked alternately one
on the other, the sealing discs (5) sealing either ports (12) or ports (12') in two

adjacent heat exchanger plates (3) in respect of the turbulence baffle (4) or (4') as
the case may be. 
A plate heat exchanger according to claim 1, characterised in that the heat
exchanger plates (43) of the plate heat exchanger (1) comprise turbulence-generating

raised portions (49), particularly frustoconical knobs.
A plate heat exchanger according to claim 1, characterised in that the cross-section
of the pressed-out portions (25, 45) is approximately the shape of a "U",

the base of the "U"-shaped pressed-out portion (25, 45) having a flattened part
(28, 48) which extends parallel with the surface of the plate heat exchanger (23,

43).
A plate heat exchanger according to one of the preceding claims 1 to 4, characterised
in that the plate heat exchanger (1) is provided with an end plate (6) which

tightly seals the apertures (12') in the adjacent heat exchanger plate (3) and has
apertures (13) which correspond to th
e apertures (12) in the adjacent heat
exchanger plate (3).
A plate heat exchanger according to claim 5, characterised in that connecting
unions (8) are inserted into the end plate (6), the smooth stem (10) of the

connecting union (8) having a groove (11).
A plate heat exchanger according to one of claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the
plate heat exchanger (1) comprises a fixing plate (7) having bores, elongated holes

or comparable means which serve for fitment on another body.
A plate heat exchanger according to one of claims 5 to 7, characterised in that the
end plate (60) is provided with outwardly extending shaped parts (61) and

apertures (62) for fixing the plate heat exchanger (1) to another body.
A plate heat exchanger according to claim 5, characterised in that the end plate
(60) is a deep-drawn sheet metal part. 
A plate heat exchanger according to one of claims 5 to 9, characterised in that
between the end plate (66) and the adjacent plate heat exchanger (3) there is an

inserted part (65) and a cover plate (71), the cover plate (71) occluding at least
one aperture (12') in the heat exchanger plate (3).
A plate heat exchanger according to claim 10, characterised in that the inserted
part (65) has raised portions (67) and a rim (68), which form flow-conducting

passages and are connected in fluid-tight fashion to the adjacent cover plate (71)
and the end plate (66).
