<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a car body for motor vehicles, the side walls (3) of which are formed, above a floor sill (2), from longitudinal, sides-forming extruded profiles (1) and the floor frame (5) of which is formed from transverse extruded profiles (4) adjoining the floor sill (2). Pillars (17, 18, 19), which are mounted on the belt line (16) and are made of bent extruded profiles, support a roof frame (20). The sides-forming extruded profiles (1) are divided in their length and are provided with specific cross-sections matched for their length region. A front edge (6) and a rear edge (7) provide the mounting outlines for a front module (8) and a rear module (9). In the case of a vehicle body of this type, the cross-section of the load-bearing parts can be varied over the length of the vehicle despite using extruded profiles. The floor frame can likewise be readily matched to the technical requirements. The mounted-on pillars bearing a roof frame allow an expansion of the possibilities for design compared to a car body comprising longitudinal extruded profiles throughout.

Body for motor vehicles, in which extruded light metal 
profiles serve as supporting and body panel-formin g 

elements, characterised in that a body is formed laterally 
in the region of the floor sills (2) as far as the 

waistline (16) by extruded profiles (1) extending in the 
longitudinal direction o
f the vehicle, a floor assembly (5) 
is formed essentially by extruded profiles (4) which extend 

transversely to the direction of travel and which are 
connected to the side-forming extruded profiles (1) in the 

region of the floor sills (2), above the waistline (16) of 
the body on the side-forming extruded profiles (1) is 

mounted a roof frame (20) consisting of curved profiles and 
supported by pillars (17, 18, 19), and in a manner known in 

the art the door openings (12) are cut out of the side-forming 
extruded profiles (1), at a front edge (6) and a 

rear edge (7) is formed a contour for fitting a front 
module (8) and a rear module (9), and the roof region over 

the roof frame (20) is covered by shaped portions, wherein 
the side-forming extruded profiles (1) arranged above the 

floor sill (2) are divided in their length and provided 
with specific cross-sections adapted to their length range. 
Body according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
floor assembly (5) is provided with cut-outs (10) which are 

filled by floor-forming portions (11) of the front module 
(8) and/or of the rear module (9), wherein the floor-forming 

portions (11) are connected to the floor assembly 
(5). 
Body according to claims 1 and 2, characterised in that 
the connection of the extruded profiles (1; 4) to each 

other in their longitudinal direction in a manner known in 
the art is formed by integrally formed joining edges 

(groove 23; shaped groove 25; dovetail profile 26) which 
interlock and form a form-locking connection.  

 
Body according to claims 1 to 3, characterised in that 
the connection of extruded profiles (1; 4) extendin g 

perpendicularly or at obtuse angles to each other in a 
manner known in the art is formed by tenons formed at the 

end cut of one extruded profile (4) and by corresponding 
openings and indentations (22) in the course of the other 

extruded profile (1), using clamping elements and/or 
welding methods and/or adhesive methods. 
Body according to claims 1 to 4, characterised in that 
end cut edges as well as cut-out edges at door openings 

(12), wheel housings or the like are covered in a manner 
known in the art by separate covering portions (30) made of 

metal or plastic, wherein the covering portions (30) are 
fixed by bolts and/or welding and/or adhesion. 
Body according to claims 1 to 5, characterised in that 
the cut edges (14, 15) of the door openings (12) as well as 

of the cut-outs for wheel housings on the inside of the 
vehicle and the outside of the vehicle have different 

shapes.
