<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of polymer blends of the type suitable for the 
preparation of hot melt adhesives, coatings, sealants, as cable floods, for modifying asphalt 
or bitumens and as additives for plastics. More specifically, the invention relates to blended 
polymer compositions comprising (a) a copolymer of ethylene and an alphaolefin and (b) 
an amorphous polypropylene, or amorphous polyalphaolefin, or mixtures thereof. Conventional amorphous polypropylenes, also known as "atactic polypropylenes" or 
"APP" are polymers which have been known and used for many years. They are tacky solid 
(at room temperatures), low molecular weight polymers having a low to very low level of 
crystallinity. Atactic polypropylenes originally were produced as undesired byproducts of 
the commercial production of isotactic polypropylene via the hydrocarbon solution or slurry 
processes, utilizing earlier versions of stereospecific catalysts. Although not the target 
products of those processes, APP nevertheless found commercial markets in such fields as 
adhesives, coatings, sealants, plastics, and asphalt or bitumen modifiers. In recent years, commercial processes for the production of isotactic polypropylene 
have undergone improvement through advances in process technology and the availability 
of improved catalysts. The result has been improved selectivity of the processes and, 
concomitantly, reduced or eliminated production of the APP byproduct. At the same time, 
demand for an equivalent APP product has been rising as a result of increased commercial 
applications of the product. The result has been the development of various technologies 
for the intentional production of APP as a primary product. Intentional production  
 
technologies make possible tailored characteristics of the APP product to confer various 
properties. Intentionally produced versions of APP now is available as a homopolymer, 
copolymer or terpolymer and in a variety of molecular weight ranges. The terms 
"amorphous polyolefins" and "amorphous polyalphaolefins" often are used interchangeably 
to describe this new class of intentionally produced amorphous polypropylenes (homo-, co- 
and terpolymers). Since the method of production does not affect the nature or utility of 
the APP or APO product, as used herein, "amorphous polypropylene" and "APP" shall 
include both the byproduct and intentionally produced amorphous polypropylenes, while 
"amorphous polyolefin" and "APO" shall refer to amorphous polyolefins generally, including,
