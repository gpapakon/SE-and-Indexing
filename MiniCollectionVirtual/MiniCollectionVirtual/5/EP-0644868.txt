<ABSTRACT>
A process for the production of a hydro(halo)fluorocarbon which comprises contacting an  alpha -fluoroether in the vapour phase at an elevated temperature with a catalyst and wherein the catalyst is treated whereby to maintain and/or restore its activity. The catalyst treatment comprises either: (i) heating the catalyst to an elevated temperature above about 250  DEG C in the absence of an  alpha -fluoroether, or (ii) contacting the catalyst at an elevated temperature with an oxidising agent whilst or between the times when the  alpha -fluoroether is contacted with the catalyst. The catalyst may be an oxidation promoting metal, for example zinc, iron or copper, carried on a metal oxide, fluoride or oxyfluoride support.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the
production of hydrofluorocarbons, in particular
hydrofluoroalkanes such as difluoromethane by the
catalysed thermal decomposition of α-fluoroethers in
particular α-fluorodialkylethers such as
bis(fluoromethyl)ether.In recent years chlorofluorocarbons, which are
used on a large scale around the world, have been
perceived as having an adverse effect on the ozone
layer and/or as contributing to global warming.
Chlorofluorocarbons are used, for example, as
refrigerants, as foam blowing agents, as cleaning
solvents and as propellants for aerosol sprays in
which the variety of applications is virtually
unlimited. Consequently, much effort is being devoted
to finding suitable replacements for
chlorofluorocarbons which will perform satisfactorily
in the many applications in which chlorofluorocarbons
are used but which will not have the aforementioned
environmentally harmful effects. One approach in the
search for suitable replacements has centred on
fluorocarbons which do not contain chlorine but which
may contain hydrogen. The hydrofluorocarbon
difluoromethane, also known as HFA 32, is of interest
as one such replacement, in particular as a
replacement in refrigeration, air-conditioning and
other applications.Several methods for the production of
difluoromethane are known but many of these methods
involve the use of chlorine-containing starting
materials and the production of chlorine-containing
by-products. Chlorine-free processes are also known
and one of these, the reaction between formaldehyde
and hydrogen fluoride at an elevated temperature in
the presence of a fluorine-containing inorganic acid, 
a metal fluoride, a metal oxide or a metal chromite,
has been described in U.S Patent Specification No.
3,377,394. The highest yield of difluoromethane
reported from this reaction is 4.2%, the major
product being methyl fluoride.In our published European Patent Application No.
0 518 506 (priority dates 14.06.91, 11.12.91, and 13.11.91,
published on 16.12.92), there is described a process for the
production of difluoromethane by contacting
bis(fluoromethyl)ether with a catalyst at elevated
temperature in the vapour phase. This catalysed
thermal decomposition of bis(fluoromethyl)ether may
achieve high conversions, for example greater than
95% conversion, based on bis(fluoromethyl)ether with
high yields, as high as 75%, or even 90% of
difluoromethane, the other major product being
monofluoromethane.In our co-pending International Application No.
