<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a nonmagnetic alloy having
excellent corrosion resistance and workability and, more
particularly, to a nonmagnetic Fe-Cr-Mn-Co system alloy or Fe-Cr-Mn-Co-Ag
system alloy having excellent physical and chemical
properties which is used in manufacturing articles in constant
contact with human body.Some austenitic stainless steels standardized by JIS
(Japanese Industrial Standards) as SUS 304 or SUS 316, and some
Ni base alloys are known to be nonmagnetic alloys which have
excellent corrosion resistance and workability.Materials for making everyday items in contact with the
body, such as wrist watch cases and spectacle frames, are
usually selected from metallic materials for its excellent
corrosion resistance and workability. Some of false teeth,
artificial joints and similar implants to the body are also made
of metallic materials. These materials are usually required to
be nonmagnetic as well as having corrosion resistance and
workability.Among typical metallic materials having such overall 
physical and chemical properties, there are the above-mentioned
austenitic stainless steels and Ni base alloys which are widely
used in making everyday articles other than surgical items and
artificial implants. For example, an alloy for making a frame
for a pair of spectacles, disclosed in Japanese Patent Public
Disclosure (JPPD) 60-24175, is one such improved austenitic
stainless steel.The austenitic stainless steel generally contains element
Ni as a main component, as does the austenitic steel disclosed
in the JPPD 60-24175. As it has been suggested in recent years
that Ni may cause allergic disorders and sometimes skin cancer,
some people are anxious about use of alloys containing Ni, such
as stainless steels and Ni base alloys. When these alloys are
used in ornamental goods, such as wrist watch cases and
spectacle frames, they are in constant contact with human skin.
Implants and medical articles, sanitary articles, table ware,
kitchen utensils and electrical articles also have direct
contact with the human body. Some European countries have
already started to regulate the Ni content of materials for
making ornamental goods such as spectacles frames and wrist
watch cases.Under these circumstances, in place of nickel silver (a
kind of Ni-Cu alloy) and Ni base alloys, in such ornamental
items, attention has turned to Ti or Ti base alloys, or Co base
alloys. Zr,Zr base alloys, Ta,Ta base alloys, and Co-Cr-Mo system
alloys have also been proposed as substitute materials for Ni
containing
