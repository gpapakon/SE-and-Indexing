<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for 
monitoring strain variations of a strain responsive element of a 
micromachined silicon sensor device, being a butterfly sensor, according to the first part of claim 1 (GB-A-2189600) for the determination of parameters affecting the butterfly sensor. Furthermore it rotates to a corresponding system according to the first part of claim 12. GB 2 223 582 
addresses a pressure responsive device, for example to be used as a 
"down well" sensor in oil drilling and exploration. Only pressure 
response is known for this device. In particular said sensors are 
made from single crystal silicon. Pressure and temperature response are known from EP-A2,3-136 627 operating with two vibration modes. In the article by Andres et al., "Sensitivity and mode 
spectrum of a frequency-output silicon pressure sensor", Sensors 
and Actuators, 15 (1988), pages 417-426, different vibrational 
modes of a so-called butterfly silicon sensor integral with a thin 
diaphragm are shown. The modes are investigated by activating 
electrically and interrogating optically. In particular for said 
modes relationships between resonance frequency and pressure are 
determined. The modes Mnm are classified in accordance with 
position and direction of node-axes. In the article by Uttamchandani et al., "Optically excited 
resonant beam pressure sensor", Electronic Letters, 
3rd December 1987, Vol. 23, No. 25, pages 1333-1334, resonance  
 
frequency/pressure and resonance frequency/temperature 
relationships for the fundamental mode of vibration of a beam-type 
micromachined silicon resonator are determined. No further 
interrelationships or dependencies are shown. Moreover from the above documents the usual way of driving 
such resonators and detecting resonance frequencies by optical 
activation/interrogation techniques is known. In particular two 
light sources, i.e. a pulsed mode source for activation and a 
continuous-wave source for interrogation are employed. Light 
transmitted by said sources is joined and guided in one fibre to 
the sensor, thus avoiding complex instrumental arrangements at the 
measuring position. Whereas from the above advantageous use of one single fibre 
for activation and interrogation of the vibrational modes of such 
sensors is known only determination of corresponding one parameter 
responsible for operation conditions as mentioned is realised. However, in most cases it is necessary to determine a set of 
parameters to qualify accurately working conditions in hostile
