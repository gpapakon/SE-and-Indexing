<ABSTRACT>
An amorphous, micro/mesoporous silica-alumina gel 
with controlled pore size, having a surface area of at 

least 500 m²/g and with a molar ratio of SiO₂:Al₂O₃ of 
at least 30:1, is prepared by hydrolysing and causing 

a tetra-alkyl ammonium hydroxide, an aluminum 
trialkoxide, and a tetra-alkyl orthosilicate to 

gelate, by operating at a temperature equal to, or 
higher than, the boiling temperature, under 

atmospheric pressure, of any alcohols which are 
developed as a by-product from sai
d hydrolysis 
reaction, without said alcohols being removed, or 

being substantially removed, from the reaction media; 
and the so produced gel being dried and fired. 
So obtained gel is an active catalyst in 
hydrocarbon conversion reactions, in particular in 

light olefin isomerization and oligomerization 
processes, e.g., in propylene oligomerization 

processes to yield useful liquid hydrocarbons for 
gasoline and jet fuel formulation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
preparing an amorphous and micro/mesoporous silica-alumina
gel having a large surface area and a
controlled pore size, which is catalytically active in
hydrocarbon conversion reactions.Some silica and alumina gels displaying catalytic
activity are known in the art. So, e.g., EP-A-160 145
discloses a process for alkylating aromatic
hydrocarbons using, as the catalyst, a silica/alumina
gel of amorphous character with a diameter of the
pores typically of 50-500 Ångstroms and with a molar
silica:alumina ratio typically comprised within the
range ofr from 1:1 to 10:1.Furthermore, R.M.S. Malton and J. Davidtz in
Journal of Catalysis, 60, 156-166 (1979) disclose a
process for the synthesis of amorphous silica and
alumina catalysts, with a controlled pore volume.Finally, US-A-5,049,536 discloses a microporous,
x-ray amorphous silica/alumina gel having a surface
area of from 500 to 1000 m2/g and a pore volume
comprised within the range of from 0.3 to 0.6 cm3/g.
Such a silica and alumina gel, which is catalytically
active in hydrocarbon preparation reactions, is
typically prepared by hydrolysing a tetra-alkyl
ammonium hydroxide, a hydrolysable aluminum compound
and a hydrolysable silicon compound and causing the
resulting hydrolysis mixture to undergo gelation by
operating in an aqueous media and at low temperatures, 
and then submitting the resulting gel to drying and
firing.The present Applicant found now, according to the
present invention, that, in relation with US-A-5,049,036,
special conditions exist for the hydrolysis
of the above mentioned reactants and subsequent
gelation which make it possible a silica-alumina gel
to be obtained which is unexpectedly improved in terms
of control of its surface characteristics, in
particular its porous structure, as well as in terms
of its catalytic performance, in particular its
activity and useful life time under use conditions.In accordance therewith, the present invention
relates to a process for preparing an amorphous,
micro/mesoporous silica-alumina gel with controlled
pore size, having a surface area of at least 500 m2/g
and with a molar ratio of SiO2:Al2O3 of at least 30:1,
by starting from a tetra-alkyl ammonium hydroxide, an
aluminum compound capable of yielding Al2O3 by
hydrolysis (i.e., hydrolysable to Al2O3), and a silicon
compound capable of yielding SiO2 by hydrolysis (i.e.,
hydrolysable to SiO2), whereby:
-- said tetra-alkyl ammonium hydroxide is a tetra-(C2-C5)-alkyl
ammonium hydroxide, said
hydrolysable
