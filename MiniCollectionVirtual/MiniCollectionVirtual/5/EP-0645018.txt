<DESCRIPTION>
 A Method and Apparatus for Battery Testing.This invention relates to a method and apparatus for testing the condition of a battery having a plurality of cells in series.It is common in various systems such as for example a mainframe computer installation to provide a back-up power supply in the form of a storage (e.g. lead-acid) battery which automatically is switched-in in the event of a mains power supply failure.At regular intervals such batteries must be tested to ensure that they are in good condition and will perform if required.The conventional method for checking such batteries, which may comprise two hundred or more individual cells, is to perform a discharge test in which the battery is connected to a load bank of relatively low resistance but high power-dissipation capacity. The heavy discharge current produced by the battery in such a test is a general indication of the overall condition of the battery, but does not reveal the condition of each cell, the failure of any one of which may disable the battery. Furthermore considerable preparatory work is necessary to bring the load-bank on-site and to connect it to the battery. In addition the test generates considerable heat and the battery requires recharging after the test.An object of the present invention is to provide a method and apparatus for testing multi-cell batteries in which the inconvenience and expense of a discharge test is avoided. Another object is to provide a method and apparatus with which it is possible to obtain an indication of the condition of each individual cell of the battery. 

 Thus, in one aspect the invention provides applying a mains-frequency AC test voltage across the battery to generate an AC current therein without drawing a DC current from the battery, measuring individually the impedance of at least one cell (as hereinafter defined) of the battery (or a quantity related thereto) and utilising the impedance or the related quantity as an indication of the condition of the at least one cell.In another aspect the invention provides apparatus for use in the aforesaid method comprising means for deriving from an AC mains supply an AC test voltage of the same frequency, means for applying the test voltage to the battery to generate an AC current therein without drawing a DC current from the battery and means for measuring the impedance of the cell or a quantity related thereto.Some large standby batteries have individual cells arranged in blocks eg. of six cells which are constructed in an integral case in the
