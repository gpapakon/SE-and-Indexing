<ABSTRACT>
The spindle shaft 50 is made flexurally elastic in its shank part 52 mounted in a bearing sleeve 20 and carries a warve 30 which is arranged underneath the neck bearing 60 and on which a drive belt engages. The bearing sleeve 20 is arranged in a spindle housing 10 with radial play 19 and is fastened at its lower end 22 via a flexurally elastic tilting joint 40 to the spindle housing 10 rigidly connected to the spindle rail. The pull of the drive belt which engages on the warve during operation deflects the bearing sleeve 20 radially according to the pull direction as a result of tilting about the tilting joint 40 and, on the other side, causes a pivoting of the bobbin-carrying upper part of the spindle shaft 50 about the neck bearing 60 in the opposite direction as a consequence of a bending moment occuring on the shank part 50. A skewing of the spindle shaft in its upper part is thus avoided. The textile spindle can be produced cost-effectively as a result of its simple design and the low stress loads in the tilting joint.
