<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a laser diode which
is low in threshold current and stabilized in transverse
mode, and a process for producing such a laser diode.Recently, in order to improve recording density of the
recording devices such as optical discs, short wavelength
laser diodes have been developed as a light source for
writing/reading. For example, laser diodes having
oscillation wavelength of 630-670 nm have been produced by
forming a double heterostructure with (AlxGa1-x)0.5In0.5P.
As a typical example of such short wavelength laser diodes,
there is known one in which a current blocking layer is
formed with GaAs.However, use of GaAs for forming the current blocking
layer causes problems of enlarged threshold current and
reduced stability of the transverse mode.On the other hand, use of a compound with high Al
ratio, such as AlAs with small refractive index, for
forming the current blocking layer has not yet been
realized since it has the difficult problems such as
deposition of polycrystals on the mask during selective
epitaxial growth.Also, in case of using a compound of (AlxGa1-x)0.5In0.5P
for forming the current blocking layer, with a high Al 
compositional ratio as compared with the cladding layers,
it is impossible to enhance the difference of the
refractive index between the current blocking layer and the
cladding layers, and there is a problem that the heat
resistance of the laser diode is markedly raised.Thus, the conventional laser diodes were
unsatisfactory, in respects of light output and
reliability, for use as a light source for information
processing devices such as optical discs.EP-A-0,408,373 and EP-A-0,440,471 disclose
transverse-mode laser diode devices. J. Crystal Growth vol
124 (1992), pp235-242 disclose a method of selective area
growth of AlGaAs and AlAs using HCl gas.As a result of the present inventors' studies for
solving the above-mentioned defects, it has been found that
by forming successively a first cladding layer of first
conduction type, an active layer and a second cladding
layer of second conduction type on a Group III - V compound
single-crystal substrate of first conduction type by a
vapor-phase epitaxy method; etching the second cladding
layer to form a ridge; and forming a current blocking layer
at the lateral side of the ridge by vapor-phase epitaxy
method, a small amount of HCl being added to a vapor-phase
epitaxial gas for during epitaxy of the current blocking
layer, a laser diode wherein the difference of refractive
index in the transverse direction
