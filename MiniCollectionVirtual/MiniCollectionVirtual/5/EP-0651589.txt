<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a self-protection system for an 
electric type heating element, particularly a heating element for washing 

machines, water heaters and like, comprising a copper terminal element 
(2; 2')having a substantially extended shape, one end of which is coupled 

to a terminal (1; 1') of the electric heating element, within the casing (6; 6') 
enclosing the electric heater, a self-protection element (4, 4') for the 

electric heater, coupled to the other end of said copper terminal element 
(2; 2') in such a way that the self-protection element (4; 4') is placed 

externally with respect to the resistance, a ring (5; 5') outer with respect to 
said self-protection element (4; 4') having thermal and electric insulation 

properties, and a closure element (7, 9), placed in correspondence of the 
end of the self-protection element (4; 4') that is not coupled to the copper 

terminal element (2; 2') and coupled with said insulating ring (5; 5').

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a self-protection system including a
resistive electrical heater element, particularly a heater element for washing
machines, water heaters and like.More particularly the invention consists in an improvement of a
system of the above kind that allows to obtain a optimum protection in case
of anomalous working of the electrical heater element.As it is well known, all the apparatuses providing an electric
heating element, must be provided with a protection system intervening in
case of anomalous working.For example, in the washing machines, the manufacturers
provide that the self-protection system must intervene within a
preestablished time, particularly 75 seconds, from the moment when the dry
working of the electrical heater element starts, in order to avoid that the
clothes within the washing machine or the adjacent plastic parts take fire.In the past, a thermofusible element out of the heater element
was provided as a self- protection element.However this kind of solution had the inconvenient that did not
guarantee the intervention of the said thermofusible element within the
required time so that the desired effect were not always obtained.Then, solutions have been proposed that were able to overcome
the above mentioned drawback, bringing the self-protection within the
heating element.A first solution of this kind is for example provided in the U.S.
patent N° 4,697,069 of Bleckmann, filed on August 22, 1983 and having
as title: "Tubular heating element provided with overload safety means".Another solution that provides this kind of solution to overcome
the drawbacks above mentioned is described in the Italian patent
application N° 22892A/83, filed on September 15,1983 in the name of
I.R.C.A. S.p.A Industria Resistenze Corazzate ed Affini, and having as title: 
"Self protected armoured electric heating element".In said Italian application a heating element is described which
provides a temperature limiting device contained within the sheath that
contains the heating element, and serially connected whit the resistance.However, it must be noted that in these second generation
solutions, the self-protection element is very close to the heating zone, so
that once the interruption is intervened, a remarkable thermal inertia verifies
determining an increasing of the temperature of the body of the
self-protection element.In consequence of this fact a temperature remarkably higher than
the exercise temperature is present inside, so that in view of the structural
features of the
