<ABSTRACT>
Method for enveloping cylindrical articles (5) having an inner likewise cylindrical free space (20) not filled with product, with the following method steps:   a) enveloping the cylindrical article (5) with a stretchable foil (14) (stretch foil) as a result of the rotational movement of foil-unwinding apparatus (4) about the vertical centre axis of the article (5) resting on the outer cylindrical surface, without completely covering the ends of the inner cylinder (20) (eyes) not filled with product (5), the foil-unwinding apparatus (4) running on a circular path differing from the horizontal position. b) circularly and uniformly covering the two orifices (eyes) of the inner cylindrical free space (20) of the article (5) on both sides in a specific region by displacing and inclining the axis of rotation (11) of the enveloping arm (2) relative to the vertical centre axis (12) of the article (5) resting on its outer cylindrical surface.

Method for wrapping a cylindrical item (5, 6) 
which has an inner free space (20), which is likewise 

cylindrical and is not filled with the item (5, 6), 
wherein the wrapping material, which consists of an 

extensible web of plastics foil (14) (stretch foil), 
leaves the end faces (eyes) of the inner cylindrical 

free space (20) on both ends uncovered in a defined 
region, the method having the following steps: 


a) wrapping the cylindrical item (5, 6) with the 
foil web (14) by rotating movement of a foil-unwinding 

device (4) around the item (5, 6) which lies on its 
external cylindrical surface, without completely 

covering the eyes; 
b) circular covering, which is even on both sides, 
of the two eyes of the free space (20) in a defined 

region, 
 
   wherein in step a) the foil-unwinding device (4) 

runs on a circular path which deviates from the 
horizontal position, and in step b) the covering of the 

two eyes takes place by shifting and inclining the axis 
of rotation (11) of the rotary arm (2) for the foil-unwinding 

device (4) relative to the vertical centre 
axis (12) of the item (5, 6) which lies on its external 

cylindrical surface.
