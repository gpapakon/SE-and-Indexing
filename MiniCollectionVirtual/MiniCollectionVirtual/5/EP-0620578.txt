<ABSTRACT>
Device for electrical insertion, in parallel with contacts of a circuit breaker, and for a defined duration after the opening of these contacts, of a component such as a resistor or a varistor, by means of a first fixed insertion contact electrically linked to the said component and to a first current socket of the circuit breaker, and of a second insertion contact, electrically connected to a second current socket of the circuit breaker, characterised in that it comprises means (16, 17) such that, in the course of an opening manoeuvre, the second insertion contact (12) passes progressively from a zero speed to the speed of movement reached by the movable assembly of the circuit breaker.
