<ABSTRACT>
A knee protector has a box-shaped basic body (1) which surrounds the front area of the knee and forms a pad for the front area of the knee. The basic body has a shell-shaped supporting surface (2) for supporting the shin below the knee joint and a set-back region (5) above the supporting surface (2). In this set-back region (5), the kneecap is freely movable in the non-bent state of the leg.

Knee protector with a box-shaped basic component (1)
enclosing the front knee area and forming a padding for the

front knee area, which has a cup-shaped support face (2) to
support the shinbone below the knee joint and a recessed

region (5) above the support face (2) which accommodates the
knee cap in the non-flexed state of the leg so that it may

move freely and which has a floor contact surface (6) on its
front side through which the lower leg of a kneeling person is

orientated in an inclined attitude toward the foot, as viewed
from the knee, characterised in that the floor contact surface

(6) has a tilting edge (7) running transversely to the knee
protector and has a floor support (8) at its front end with a

gap separating it from the tilting edge (7) and is thus
supported in two positions with differing slants either on its

rear region or on the tilting edge (7) and floor support (8).
Knee protector according to claim 1, characterised in
that it is provided in the lower region with holding straps

(3, 4) which are wrapped around the lower leg.
Knee protector according to claims 1 or 2, characterised
in that the floor support has two lateral support surfaces

(12, 13) and between them an elastically deformable knee
support face (14) which does not come into contact with the

Knee protector according to at least one of the previous
claims, characterised in that the region (9) between the front

floor support (8) and the tilting edge (7) does not come into
contact with the floor.
Knee protector according to at least one of the previous
claims, characterised in that it consists of an outer shell 

(15) and an insert component (16) set into it and consisting
of padding.
Knee protector according to claim 5, characterised in
that the insert component (16) is shaped to the individual

requirements of the user.
Knee protector according to at least one of the previous
claims, characterised in that the support surface (2) for the
