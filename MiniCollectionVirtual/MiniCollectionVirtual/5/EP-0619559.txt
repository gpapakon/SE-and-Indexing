<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an integrated analog-digital boundary interface for time 
multiplexed communication systems. In digital communication applications, for example GSM or digital AMPS mobile phones, 
there is an analog-digital boundary interface on carrier or intermediate frequency. At this 
boundary interface, both A/D and D/A conversions are carried out for symbol signals. In time multiplexed digital cellular systems (TDMA, Time Division Multiple Access), 
such as GSM and digital AMPS, transmitting and receiving alternate in time slots. In 
digital transmitters one or more D/A converters are used and likewise in the receivers one 
or more A/D converters, are used. The prior art is described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which: Figure 1 is a block diagram of a prior art digital carrier frequency receiver. Figure 2 is a block diagram of a prior art digital carrier frequency transmitter. Figure 3 is a block diagram of a prior art Analog Front End (AFE) circuit used in digital 
communication systems. The diagram shown in figure 1 is a block diagram of a prior art digital carrier frequency 
receiver. An incoming carrier frequency signal is brought to A/D converters 3, 4 through 
filters 1, 2. The converted signal is brought to a digital receiver 5. The diagram shown in figure 2 is a block diagram of a prior art digital carrier frequency 
transmitter. A digital transmitter 6 transmits the signal to D/A converters 7, 8. The converted 
signal is brought to filters 9, 10, which output the carrier frequency signal.  The diagram shown in figure 3 is a block diagram of a prior art digital communication 
system's Analog Front End (AFE) circuit. The filters 1, 2, 9, 10 and converters 3, 4, 7, 
8 have been integrated on the common AFE integrated circuit (IC) 12. The digital 
receiver/transmitter unit is marked with reference numeral 11. In the Analog Front End (AFE) circuit 12 there are one or more A/D converters 3, 4 in a 
receiver branch and one or more D/A converters 7,8 in a transmitter branch. In the same 
circuit there are also typically receiver filters 1,2 and corresponding transmitter filters 9, 
10 for the intermediate frequency carrier. As the circuit is commonly integrated with 
CMOS technology, all the functions can be laid out on the same integrated circuit 12. 
This takes up a lot of the chip area of the circuit 12. A complex circuit causes a lot of 
coupling interference and noise and makes the circuit itself sensitive to other interference 
sources. According to the present
