<ABSTRACT>
A bidirectional thin-film magnetoresistive tape head assembly (180). The invention minimizes wear on the head assembly by: (1) minimizing the distance between the read elements (186) and their respective write elements (198), (2) forming the head assembly from hard materials, and (3) placing a hard block (50) between the read and write elements. The head assembly uses only a single pair of read and write elements per data track, but the pairs are reversed with respect to each other so that the head assembly is capable of reading-while-writing on the tape in both directions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns an improved thin-film magnetoresistive tape 
head assembly. In current, state of the art magnetic tape recorders adapted for computer 
data storage, a read-while-write capability is an essential feature for providing 
virtually error free magnetically stored data. A read-while-write head assembly 
comprises a write element in-line with a read element, the gap of the read element 
being closely spaced to the gap of the write element, with the read element 
positioned downstream of the write element in the direction of tape motion. By 
continually reading "just recorded" data, the quality of the recorded data is 
immediately determinable at a time when the original data is still available in 
temporary storage in the recording system. The reproduced data is checked 
against the original data, and appropriate action, such as re-recording, may be 
taken in case of error. Many modern tape recording systems require operation where writing and 
reading of the data occurs for either direction of tape travel. The streaming tape 
system where the recording is laid down on the tape in a serpentine pattern for 
alternate directions of tape travel is an example of such a bidirectional recording 
system. Incorporation of read-while-writing capability for bidirectional operation 
has traditionally necessitated a head assembly consisting of three heads: a first 
write element adjacent to a read element which is adjacent to a second write 
element, or a first read element adjacent to a write element which is adjacent to 
a second read element. See, for example, U.S.-A-5,034,838. The quantity of data stored on a magnetic tape may be increased by 
increasing the number of data tracks on the tape, thereby decreasing the distance 
between the centerlines of adjacent tracks. Tape heads which are suitable for 
reading and writing on such tapes require a high level of precision in the alignment 
of the read and write elements in the head assembly. This may be achieved by  
 
minimizing the distance between each read element and its respective write 
element. The problem of aligning the read and write elements may also be 
simplified by eliminating one of the three heads, although, as in the case of the 
IBM 3480 system, this has traditionally eliminated the capability of bidirectional 
read-while-write. Tape heads also suffer from the problem of head wear caused by the 
magnetic recording tape. Repeated passes of a tape over the tape head will, over 
time, wear away at the surface of the tape
