<ABSTRACT>
Geopolymer-modified gypsum construction 
materials. Compositions derived from 

combining geopolymer adhesive with 
conventional gypsum wallboard slurry 

formulations produce an interpenetrating 
network (IPN) which cures by loss of process 

water to a refractory solid having improved 
fire and water resistance. Geopolymer 

adhesive starting compositions include 
soluble and insoluble silicates, buffers and 

salts, and a chemical setting agent in 
aqueous suspension.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to gypsum 
wallboard construction material, and more particularly 
to the modification of such materials by the addition of 
silica-based geopolymer adhesives to produce composites 
which exhibit improved fire performance, water 
resistance, and structural properties. Gypsum wallboard is a widely used construction material 
because of its low cost and fire resistance. Fire 
resistance capability is generally proportional to the 
thickness of the gypsum employed in a fire resisting 
structure. For example, a simple structure approved for 
a fire endurance period of one hour uses a 5/8" thick 
slab of Type X gypsum wallboard on either side of a 3-5/8" 
metal stud with an air filled cavity for a non-load-bearing 
wall assembly. Other designs provide fire 
resistance for periods of up to two hours. Gypsum is a naturally occurring form of the di-hydrate 
of calcium sulfate. This material can be readily 
transformed to its stucco form, the hemi-hydrate of 
calcium sulfate, by one of several calcination 
processes. Gypsum provides fire protection through two 
primary mechanisms: the non-combustible nature of 
inorganic compounds; and the endothermic, energy-absorbing  
 
capacity of the dihydrate which produces steam 
when exposed to intense heat. In equation form, gypsum 
---- Plaster of Paris + Steam - Energy, or CaSO₄ (2H₂O) 
---- CaSO₄ (0.5H₂O) + 1.5H₂O - 4100 cal/mole. A wall which is to endure fire for a period of at least 
one hour must be able to withstand temperatures well in 
excess of 1500°F. This temperature is considerably in 
excess of the ignition temperature of most organic 
materials (about 450-800°F). Thus, a fire-resistant 
wall must maintain the temperature of the unexposed face 
of the wall at a moderately low temperature in order to 
prevent the spread of the fire. A further consideration 
for an acceptable fire-resistant wall is the integrity 
of the wall assembly against penetration by a water 
stream from a fire hose at the termination of the fire 
exposure period. Masonry walls achieve these conditions 
as a result of the high structural/thermal mass and 
large heat capacity inherent in the dense materials 
utilised. Lightweight wall assemblies, by contrast, 
require good thermal insulation in lieu of large thermal 
mass. The utilisation of the heat of dehydration of 
gypsum can provide an effective cooling mechanism for a 
fire-resistant wall. However, as this water of 
hydration, which binds the gypsum material, is converted  
 
to steam, the
