<DESCRIPTION>
 ORAL COMPOSITIONS FOR SUPPRESSING MOUTH ODORSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to oral compositions for the control of volatile 5 compounds associated with oral malodor."Oral composition" means a composition for topical applications to the oral . cavity to clean and care for the teeth as well as the oral cavity surfaces. Representatives of such compositions are oral hygiene products and dentifrices such as mouthwashes or rinses, toothpaste, dental gels, tooth powder, chewing gum, lozenges, and similar products. In 10 addition to cleaning teeth to remove dental plaque, the function of oral hygiene preparations is to stop the formation of dental calculus, to prevent dental disorders such as caries, periodontitisand gingivitis, and also to eliminate halitosis.Dental plaque is a deposit which forms on teeth and consists of inorganic and organic components derived from saliva, food and bacteria which are present in the oral cavity. 15 When plaque undergoes calcification it forms dental calculus, or tartar as it is sometimes called. Dental calculus is largely calcium and orthophosphate arranged in a crystal lattice called hydroxyapatite (HAP).Oral malodor, or halitosis, is caused by the putrefactive activity of microorganisms on appropriate substrate components of dental plaque, debris adhering to mucous membranes 20 and salivary cellular elements to produce volatile sulfur compounds These sulfur volatiles primarily consists of hydrogen sulfide (H-S), methyl mercaptan (CH3SH) and traces of dimethyl sulfide (CH-)-S. Volatile sulfur compounds, aromatic amines, ammonia and urea have also been shown to increase in the mouth of patients suffering from periodontal disease, see, for example,/ Periodontal Res., 15, 185-192 (1980), Clin. Chem., 27, 842-845 (1981), Intl. Den. J., 28, 25 309-319 (1978).Methods of inhibiting volatile sulfur compounds to reduce the production of mouth odor have included the use of dentifrices containing antimicrobials, such as, chlorhexidine. However, the side effects associated with chlorhexidine, such as a bitter taste 

 and staining of the teeth, tongue, gums and oral mucosa, precludes the use of chlorhexidine in oral compositions.Copper compounds including copper chlorophyllin, copper gluconate, copper citrate and copper long chain alkyloyl sarcosine have been used to reduce mouth odors. See, for example- U-S- Patents 3,044,939; 3,565,933 and 4,112,066 and Nippon Shishyubyo Gakkai Kaishi, 490-498 (1981) for oral compositions containing such compounds. These
