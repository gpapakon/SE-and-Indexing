An easy-to-peel film comprising polyethylene 2,6-naphthalate as the main resin component and having a 
limiting viscosity (η) of 0.31 to 0.6; a process for producing a stretched polyethylene 2,6-naphthalate 

film having 
a limiting viscosity (η) of 0.31 to 0.6; a resin comprising a mixture of polyethylene 2,6-naphthalate 

resins having 
mutually different limiting viscosities; a modified polyethylene 2,6-naphthalate 

resin having three or more ester-forming 
functional groups as a hydroxy compound; a wrapping film produced from these resins; and a method of 

wrapping with this film. The film has gas-barrier, easy-to-peel, easy-to-tear 
and press-through properties, and can be 

used for various wrapping uses.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a press-through pack (PTP) or blister pack comprising a cover film formed from a polyethylene-2,6-naphthalate
resin.
The cover
film of the present invention has a gas barrier property and,
further, is easy to open and easy to tear and has a
press-through property.Aromatic polyesters exemplified by polyethylene
terephthalate (hereinafter abbreviated to "PET") and
polybutylene terephthalate (PBT) have excellent
mechanical strength, heat resistance, chemical resistance
and other properties and, hence, have been widely used in
various industrial applications. Among them,
polyethylene-2,6-naphthalate (hereinafter abbreviated to
"PEN") is superior to PET in mechanical strength (Young's
modulus and breaking strength), heat resistance (long-term
heat stability and dimensional stability), chemical
properties (chemical resistance and gas barrier property)
and other properties by virtue of the rigidity and
plainness of the molecular chain and, in recent years,
have attracted considerable attention (Japanese Patent
Publication Nos. 29541/1973 and 40917/1973). High-performance
films of PEN, which have utilized the above
properties, for example, base films for magnetic tapes
and capacitor films, are currently on the market.
Further, PEN is a promising candidate for use in other
applications, that is, as a high-performance packaging
material in the field of various packaging materials. Paper, various plastics and the like are currently
in use as packaging materials and applied to packaging
materials having a gas barrier property, freshness
retaining packaging materials, heat-resistant packaging
materials, easy-open packaging materials and mischief
preventive packaging materials.Regarding easy-open packages, various easy-open
packaging materials have been developed such as those
using a stretched film, as disclosed in Japanese Patent
Laid-Open Nos. 55059/1988 and 96066/1988 and Japanese
Utility Model Publication No. 11258/1979; easy-tear
packaging materials exemplified by pouches provided with
a cut, a scratch, a perforation or an opening tape, as
disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Nos. 52065/1987,
39465/1987, 82965/1988, and 67273/1988; peelable
packaging materials wherein the contents are taken out by
peeling off a heat-sealed cover, as disclosed in Japanese
Patent Laid-Open Nos. 109768/1987, 27254/1988,
96067/1988, and 307073/1988; and easy-open caps.For easy-tear packaging materials, air tightness and
an increase in speed have been pursued in bag
making/charge packing, and
