<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to rapamycin formulations for iv injection, and to
processes for preparing them. The invention disclosed herein provides an aqueous
formulation of rapamycin for intravenous injection (iv) without the need of a surfactant.
In one aspect the invention comprises a concentrate solution of rapamycin in propylene
glycol, in combination with a diluent consisting of water, in given proportions as
described below.Rapamycin is a macrolide antibiotic produced by Streptomyces hygroscopicus
which was discovered first for its properties as an antifungal agent. It adversely affects
the growth of fungi such as Candida albicans and Microsporum gypseum..
Rapamycin, its preparation and its antibiotic activity were described in U.S. Patent No.
3,929,992, issued December 30, 1975 to Surendra Sehgal et al. In 1977 Martel, R. R.
et al. reported on immunosuppressive properties of rapamycin against experimental
allergic encephalitis and adjuvant arthritis in the Canadian Journal of Physiological
Pharmacology, 55, 48-51 (1977). In 1989, Calne, R. Y. et al. in Lancet, 1989, no. 2,
p. 227 and Morris, R. E. and Meiser, B. M. in Medicinal Science Research, 1989, No.
17, P. 609-10, separately reported on the effectiveness of rapamycin in inhibiting
rejection in vivo in allograft transplantation. Numerous articles have followed
describing the immunosuppressive and rejection inhibiting properties of rapamycin, and
clinical investigation has begun for the use of rapamycin in inhibiting rejection in
transplantation in man.Rapamycin is insoluble in water and is only slightly soluble in solubilizers,
such as propylene glycol, glycerin and PEG 400, commonly used in preparing
parenteral formulations. It is only sparingly soluble in PEG 300 and is insoluble or
very slightly soluble in commonly used aqueous injectable co-solvent systems, such as,
20% ethanol/water, 10% DMA/water, 20% Cremophor ELÂ®/water and 20%
polysorbate 80/water. For these reasons clinically and commercially acceptable
injectable formulations of rapamycin have been difficult to make. An injectable
composition of rapamycin is described in European Patent Publication No. 0041795,
published December 16, 1981. In this injectable formulation rapamycin is first
dissolved in a low boiling point organic solvent, namely, acetone, methanol or ethanol. 
This solution is then mixed with a nonionic surfactant selected from polyoxyethylated
fatty acids; polyoxyethylated fatty alcohols; and polyoxyethylated glycerin hydroxy
fatty acid esters, e.g. polyoxyethylated
