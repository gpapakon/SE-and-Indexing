<ABSTRACT>
A method for stress testing decoders and other 
periphery circuits used with a memory array. An address 

buffer simultaneously sets the inputs of a plurality of 
decoders to a first common voltage level, so that a 

plurality of rows and/or columns within the memory array 
are selected for a predetermined period of time. A stress 

voltage is then applied to the integrated circuit to stress 
test the gate oxides within the decoders and other 

periphery circuits. The inputs of the plurality of 
decoders are then simultaneously set to a second common 

voltage level, so that the plurality of rows and/or columns 
within the memory array are deselected. Finally, a stress 

voltage is applied to the integrated circuit to stress test 
the gate oxides within the decoders and other periphery 

circuits.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to integrated
circuits, and more particularly to memory arrays in
integrated circuits. Still more particularly, the present
invention relates to a method for stress testing decoders
and periphery circuits used with memory arrays.Memory arrays use many different circuits in order to
operate. For example, row decoders, column decoders, write
decoders, pre-coding and post-coding circuits may be used.
Stress testing of memory arrays, decoders and other
periphery circuits used with memory arrays is typically
accomplished by applying a stress voltage to the integrated
circuit. Most latent defects within the memory array and
various circuits are detected as a result of stress
testing.Stress testing of decoders and other periphery
circuits used with memory arrays, however, is typically not
performed due to the length of time required for testing.
In order to stress test each gate in the decoders and other
periphery circuits, each and every address combination must
be selected individually. A stress voltage would then be
applied to the integrated circuit. However, those skilled
in the art will appreciate that selecting and stressing
each and every address combination requires quite a bit of
time. Consequently, stress testing of decoders and other
periphery circuits is usually not performed.For example, to test the decoders and other circuits
used with a 128K by 8k memory array, 128,000 address
combinations must be activated individually, and then set 
to a stress voltage. Understandably, cycling through
128,000 address combinations would be a very time consuming
task. A result of not performing a stress test is that
latent defects in the decoders and periphery circuitry go
undetected. This results in the production of marginal
memory arrays.In "IEEE Journal of Solid State Circuits Volume 23 No
4, August 1988 pages 933-941", the article "Parallel
Testing of Parametric Faults in a 3-Dimensional Dynamic
Random-Access Memory" (Mazumder), a method of stress
testing decoders in a DRAM circuit is described in which
there are provided SELECT and address inputs, whereby
plural inputs may be set to a common voltage level. This
article therefore discloses a decoder of enhanced
complexity.Therefore, it would be desirable to provide a method
for stress testing decoders and other periphery circuits
used with a memory array. It is also desirable that such
a method not increase the complexity of the testing or
fabrication of an integrated circuit.According to a first aspect of the
