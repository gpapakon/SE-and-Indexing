<ABSTRACT>
A method of mounting a grille (30) between a pair of spaced headlight housings (15) on a vehicle (11). The grille (30) is fixed directly onto mounting points (24, 25) formed on the headlight housings (15). The grille (30) has upper and lower attachment means (34, 35) at each end that co-operate with attachment means on the headlight housings (15).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved radiator grille 
arrangement where the grille can be attached to the vehicle 
front without the need for any tools. In a typical arrangement the radiator grille is mounted on the 
front of the vehicle between the headlight housings. The most 
common method of fixing the grille to the vehicle is by the 
use of screws, typically self tapping screws which are 
generally arranged in a horizontal configuration to fasten the 
grille to a portion of the vehicle body sheet metal. This method generally requires the use of tools on the vehicle 
production line, sometimes special tools. Furthermore there 
can be a build up of tolerances between the headlight 
housings, vehicle body, and grille which may cause unsightly 
gaps between the grille and the headlight housings, or other 
vehicle body components. In EP-A-332 846, 
there is disclosed a radiator grille that has 
on a lower portion projections which push into an elastomeric 
grommet in a car body member, and on its upper portion 
resilient clips that snap into the vehicle bodywork. Again 
such mounting means suffer from the problems of a build up of 
a chain of tolerances. The present invention provides a different approach to 
mounting radiator grilles in vehicles and which avoid the 
problems associated with the build up of tolerances. Accordingly there is provided a method of mounting a vehicle 
radiator grille between spaced headlights on the vehicle  
 
characterised in that the radiator grille is fixed directly to 
attachment means formed on the vehicle headlight housing. Preferably the lower portion of the grille is secured to the 
headlight housings by means that allow vertical movement of 
the radiator grille relative to the headlight housing, and the 
upper portion of the grille is secured to the headlight 
housing using a snap-in connection therebetween. Also according to the invention there is provided a radiator 
grille for mounting a motor vehicle between a pair of 
headlights, the radiator grille having attachment means at 
each end portion thereof for securing the grille in the 
vehicle headlight housings and comprising first attachment 
means adjacent a lower portion of the grille and having a 
sliding connection to the headlight housing to allow relative 
vertical play and a second attachment means adjacent the upper 
portion of the grille which has a vertical holding surface 
engageable with the headlight housing to lock the grille into 
position. Preferably the first attachment means comprises an

<CLAIMS>
A method of mounting a vehicle radiator grille (30) 
between spaced headlights on the vehicle characterised in that 

the radiator grille (30) is moved from outside the vehicle and 
fixed directly to attachment means (24,25) formed on the 

vehicle headlight housing (15). 
A method as claimed in Claim 1 wherein a first portion of 
the grille (30) is secured to the headlight housings (15) by a 

first attachment means (35) that allow vertical movement of 
the radiator grille relative to the headlight housings, and a 

second portion is secured to the headlight housing (15) by a 
second attachment means (24,34 )in shape of a snap-in 

connection therebetween. 
A method as claimed in Claim 2 wherein the first portion 
of the grille (30) is located below the second portion. 
A method as claimed in Claim 2 or Claim 3, wherein the 

snap-in connection ( 24,34) is made by downward vertical 
movement of the grille (30) relative to the headlight housing 

(15). 
A method as claimed in any one of Claims 2 to 4 wherein 
the snap-in connections (24,34 ) each comprise at least one 

resilient clip (24) having a detent thereon which engages in a 
corresponding hole (37), the clip (24) being mounted on the 

housing (15) and the hole (37) being located on the second 
portion of the grille (30). 
A method as claimed in any one of Claims 2 to 5 wherein 
the first attachment means (25) each comprise a vertical pin 

which engages in a corresponding slot (39), the pin being 
located on the housing and the slot (39) being located on the 

grille (30).  
 
A radiator grille (30) for mounting on a motor vehicle 
between a pair of headlights characterised in that the 

radiator grille (30) has attachment means (34,35) at each end 
portion thereof for securing the grille to the vehicle 

headlight housings (15) and comprising first attachment means 
(35) having a sliding connection (39) to the headlight housing 

(15) to allow relative vertical play and a second attachment 
means (34) in shape of a snap-in connection engagable with the 

housing to lock the grille (30) into position. 
A radiator grille (30) as claimed in Claim 7 wherein the 
first attachment means (35) is adjacent a lower portion of the 

grille (30) and the second attachment means (34) is adjacent 
an upper portion of the grille (30). 
A radiator grille as claimed in Claim 7 or 8 wherein the 
second attachment means (34) is one part of a snap-in 

connection (24,34) comprising a resilient detent (24)and a 
corresponding holding surface (37), where the other part of 

the snap-in connection is located on the headlight housing, 
the holding surface (37) being vertical and located on the 

grille (30) and comprising the sides of a hole (37). 
A radiator grille as claimed in any one of Claims 7 to 9 
wherein each first attachment means (35) is an elongated slot 

(39) which engages a transverse horizontal pin (25), where 
either the slot (39) or the pin (25) is located on the grille 

(30). 
A radiator grille as claimed in Claim 10 wherein the 
elongated slot is located on the grille (30). 
A headlight housing (15) characterised in having on its 
axial inner side, attachment means (24 25) for securing a 

radiator grille (30) thereto.  
 
A headlight housing (15) as claimed in Claim 12 wherein 
the attachment means comprise a first attachment means (25) 

having a guide surface that permits vertical and transverse 
relative movement of the radiator grille whilst restricting 

its longitudinal movement, and a second attachment means (24) 
forming part of a snap-in connection with the grille. 
A headlight housing (15) as claimed in Claim 13 wherein 
the first attachment means (25) is located below the second 

attachment means (24).
