<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a 4,4'-dihydroxydiphenylsulfone 
monomer composition which provides a polymer showing no yellowing 
when the composition is used as the material and a novel process for 
production thereof. The monomer composition comprises a salt of an 
organic acid in the amount corresponding to an amount of the metal 
component in the range of 10 to 10,000 ppm by weight of the composition. Monomer compositions containing 4,4'-dihydroxydiphenylsulfone 
(hereinafter referred to as 4,4'-Compound) are used as materials of 
plastics having excellent transparency, superior mechanical properties, 
high heat resistance, good flame retarding property and excellent 
chemical resistance, such as polyethersulfones and polysulfones, and as 
materials in other fields of the polymer industry. However, 4,4'-Compound monomer compositions generally 
contain impurities, such as 2,4'-dihydroxydiphenylsulfone (hereinafter 
referred to as 2,4'-Compound), in addition to 4,4'-Compound of the main 
component. Polymer materials prepared by using a 4,4'-Compound 
monomer composition containing impurities show yellowing caused by 
the impurities. No process which can produce a 4,4'-Compound  
 
monomer composition showing no yellowing with good yield has 
heretofore been known. For production and purification of 4,4'-Compound, processes 
comprising treatment with various kinds of mixed organic solvent have 
been proposed (Japanese Patent Publications Showa 51(1976)-36264, 
Showa 57(1982)-48152, Showa 57(1982)-48153 and Showa 58(1983)-2234). 
However, these processes have a drawback that they cause 
environmental problems because they all employ solvents containing 
halogen. Another process of two-baths and two-stages which comprises 
adding an agent for salting out to an aqueous solution of a monometal 
salt of 4,4'-Compound to salt out the monometal salt, dissolving the 
separated monometal salt of 4,4'-Compound in water and separating 
4,4'-Compound by deposition with addition of an acid to the solution was 
proposed (Japanese Patent Publications Showa 64(1989)-50855, Showa 
64(1989)-50856, Heisei 4(1992)-78609 and Heisei 5(1993)-12344). However, 
this process has a number of drawbacks that it cannot be applied to a 
crude product having a lower content of 4,4'-Compound, that an agent 
for salting out is necessary, and that components responsible for the 
yellowing cannot be removed. Moreover, it has a serious drawback that, 
when 4,4'-Compound is prepared by a simple process of deposition with 
addition of an
