<ABSTRACT>
A programmable time lock (9) includes a microprocessor (32), which senses the angular position of a key shaft (16) via a sensor/encoder (13). The microprocessor (32) includes ROM (33) and RAM (35) memory circuits, a timer (37), and a clock (39), and it can activate a stepper motor (42) to control the position of a detent pin (18). The microprocessor (32) is also connected to a display (12), which has fields for hours (20), minutes (24) and seconds (26), as well as for the days of the week (28), for a cursor (30) for each day, and for a low-power indicator. System time, as well as opening times for the lock may be set and changed simply by turning the key (11) according to predefined routines. A method for operating the lock includes sets of steps for each of several routines.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PROGRAMMABLE ELECTRONIC TIME LOCKBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Technical FieldThis invention involves a programmable electronic time lock, especially for use in controlling the opening of vaults, and also a method for operating the lock.Description of Related ArtSecurity is naturally of the utmost importance in the design of locking systems for such restricted access areas as bank vaults. There are accordingly a large number of mechanical and electro-mechanical locking devices. One problem with existing lock systems is that the more secure they are, the more complex they are, and authorized users are constrained by the locks either to accept fixed opening times, complicated time-changing procedures, or poor overview of the status of the lock. Some devices have attempted to address certain of these drawbacks by taking advantage of more modern electronic and electro-mechanical components. Such existing electronic devices are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,875,351 (Evans et al., October 24, 1991); PCT application PCT/EP36/00133 (Skye, S.A., published on September 12, 1986 as WO 86/05230); and PCT application PCT/CH91/00111 (Ciposa Microtechniques, S.A., published on November 28, 1991 as WO 91/18168).The existing devices suffer from several additional disadvantages. First, the more modern, electronic time locks typically do not match existing mechanical movements with respect to size or mounting. As such, retro-fitting more modern designs is either impossible or unduly expensive. Second, most existing designs do not allow the user to set the actual time or to monitor the actual time when the vault door is open. Third, existing lock systems do not allow the user to program opening times for a full seven-day week and to monitor the opening times; ideally, the locking system should display to the authorized user 

not only the status of all seven days of the weeks, but also the specific day and time of the- next programmed opening.One other drawback of existing lock systems is that they make it difficult or impossible to change opening times without completely resetting the mechanism. In order to accommodate temporary deviations from the normal opening routine, the user should be able to change the opening time within a given day, or to change the opening schedule for a given day of the week, without having to reset the main schedule for the system. This may, for example, be necessary on days in which the bank is to open later than normal, or when the bank will not be opening at all because of a holiday.

<CLAIMS>
CLAIMS 1. A programmable time lock comprising: a processor; a locking pin with an armed and a disarmed position; an electric motor connected to the processor and to the locking pin; a display, connected to the processor, with a time display field, a day-of-the-week display field including day segments, and a cursor indicator for each day segment; a source of electric voltage connected to the processor, the motor and the display; a rotatable key shaft; a key that fits removably on the key shaft; a key position sensor/encoder electrically connected to the processor and generating electrical rotary position signals corresponding to an angular position of the key shaft; a clock circuit electrically connected to the processor; memory means for storing an opening time signal for each of the days of the week; said processor being provided for decoding the rotary position signals and storing in the memory means the opening time signals corresponding to opening times for preselected days of the week and for activating the electric motor to move the locking pin into the disarmed position at the opening times on the days of the week for which opening times are stored.
2. A programmable time lock as defined in claim 1, in which the processor is further provided for directing the display to display a system time, for incrementing and decrementing the system time in response to rotary key motion in a first and second direction, respectively, and for storing a system time signal corresponding to the displayed system time when the key is stationary for a predetermined acceptance period. 


 3. A programmable time lock as defined in claim 1, in which the processor is further provided for directing the display to display a next opening time when the locking pin is in the armed position.
4. A method for setting and operating a programmable time lock including the following steps:
A) arming the lock by turning a key connected to a key position sensor/encoder; B) setting a displayed system time by turning the key, which is rotatable in a first and second direction; and
C) entering the system time by leaving the key stationary for a predetermined acceptance period.
5. A method as described in claim 4, including the following additional steps:
A) sequentially activating on a display day indicator segments corresponding to the seven days of the week;
B) for each displayed day of the week for which the key is kept stationary for the acceptance period, activating the day indicator corresponding to the next day of the week in sequence; C) for each displayed day of the week for which the key is moved during display of the corresponding day indicator segment: i) sequentially flashing hour indicator segments, incrementing the displayed hour upon rotation of the key in the first direction and decrementing the displayed hour upon rotation of the key in the second direction; ii) sequentially flashing minute indicator segments, incrementing the displayed minute upon rotation of the key in the first direction and decrementing the displayed minute upon rotation of the key in the second direction; and 


 iii) entering into a memory primary opening time signals corresponding to the displayed hour and minute when the key is stationary for a confirmation period.
6. A method as described in claim 5, including the following additional steps:

B) upon sensing motion of the key alternately in the first, and second directions after expiration of a first routine selection period but before expiration of a second routine selection period, displaying a second specialty display for a display period, and, if the key is 


stationary during the display period, executing the following steps: i) sequentially displaying entered opening days and opening times while the key is stationary; and ii) for each displayed and entered opening day for which the key is moved, except a last remaining opening day, cancelling the primary opening time for the displayed day and deactivating the corresponding cursor indicator.
8. A method as described in claim 5, including the following additional steps:
A) after entry of the opening time signals into the memory, upon subsequent arming of the lock, displaying the next entered primary opening time;
B) upon sensing motion of the key alternately in the first and second directions after expiration of a first and second routine selection period but before expiration of a third routine selection period, displaying a third specialty display for a display period, and, if the key is stationary during the display period, executing the following steps: i) displaying the hour of the system time; ii) setting an adjusted hour by incrementing the displayed hour by one upon rotation of the key in the first direction and decrementing the displayed hour by one upon rotation of the key in the second direction, whereby the adjusted hour differs from the system time hour by no more than one; iii) displaying the minute of the system time; iv) setting an adjusted minute by incrementing the displayed minute upon rotation of the key in the first direction and decrementing the displayed hour upon rotation of the key in the second direction, whereby the adjusted minute differs from the system time hour by no more than fifty-nine; and
