<ABSTRACT>
A device for protecting a motor vehicle against illicit use has a driving system controlled by a board computer (40). The device consists of a smart card (1) with a microprocessor (12) and a smart card reader and writer (20) connected to the board computer. The microprocessor processes the information received from the smart card reader and writer into operational data for starting the motor vehicle and supplies them through the smart card reader and writer to the board computer, so that the motor vehicle may be started. The advantage of the invention is that it ensures an increased protection of the motor vehicle against thefts.
