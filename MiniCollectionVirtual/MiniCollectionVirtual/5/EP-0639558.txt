<ABSTRACT>
The present invention can provide a process for the 
preparation of an 1-acyl-2-substituted hydrazine compound from a 

mixture containing the 1-acyl-2-substituted hydrazine and an 1-acyl-1-substituted 
hydrazine by selective hydrolysis or 

alcoholysis of the 1-acyl-1-substituted hydrazine in the 
presence of an acid catalyst, and by separation of the resulting 

carboxylic acid and derivative thereof. 
The 1-acyl-2-alkyl hydrazine obtained has a high purity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the 
preparation of 1-acyl-2-alkyl hydrazines which are usable 
intermediates for the production of 1-alkyl-1,2-diacyl 
hydrazines which are known to have insecticidal activities. As methods for the synthesis of monoacyl monoalkyl 
hydrazines, it is an usual one that acyl chlorides are condensed 
with alkyl hydrazines in the presence of bases. In this hydrazide formation reaction with acyl chlorides, 
there is low regioselectivity for the nitrogen atom at 1- or 2-position. 
Therefore, the desired product, 1-acyl-2-alkyl 
hydrazine, may be obtained only in the form of a mixture of it 
and the by-product, 1-acyl-1-alkyl hydrazine. For the selective preparation of 1-acyl-2-alkyl hydrazines, 
European Patent Nos. 236618, 232075 and 286746 describe a 
certain method wherein hydrazones are derived from 
acylhydrazines and then reduced. Japanese Patent Application Laying Open (KOKAI) No. 4-290856 
(1992) describes another method wherein the condensation  
 
is carried out using ArCOCCl3 instead of the acyl chlorides to 
decrease the formation of 1-acyl-1-alkyl hydrazines. For the selective preparation of 1-acyl-1-alkyl hydrazines, 
European Patent No. 228564 and U.S. Patent No. 4814349 describe 
a method wherein hydrazones are derived from alkylhydrazines, 
acylated and then hydrolyzed. J. Heterocycl. Chem. vol. 14, no. 7, 1977, pages 1147 to 1150 relates to 
hydrolysis of diacylhydrazines while the claimed invention relates to 
hydrolysis of monoacylhydrazines. The method in this cited reference 
induces the rearrangement of an alkyl group and the yield is low. On the 
contrary, the claimed invention induces highly selective hydrolysis of only 
one of two monoacylhydrazine derivatives. J. Indian, Chem. Soc. vol. 64, no. 2, 1987, pages 122 to 124 relates to 
hydrolysis of hydrazides having no substituent while the claimed invention 
relates to hydrolysis of hydrazides having a substituent. The regioselectivity is important in acylation of 
hydrazines because they are difunctional molecules. When monoacyl monoalkylhydrazines are prepared from acyl 
chlorides and monoalkylhydrazines, there are obtained mixtures 
of 1-acyl-2-alkylhydrazines and 1-acyl-1-alkylhydrazines and it 
is difficult to obtain 1-acyl-2-alkylhydrazines with high 
purities. In addition, 1-acyl-2-tertiary-alkylhydrazines can not be 
prepared by the methods as described in the above-mentioned 
European Patents, wherein hydrazones are derived from hydrazines 
and then reduced. The invention provides
