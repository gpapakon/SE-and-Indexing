<ABSTRACT>
An automatic frequency control system, for an optical 
coherent communication system, in which the frequency of 

local oscillation light 5 from coherent light communication 
receiver 100 are swept to pull the intermediate frequency 

at a stable AFC point. The AFC is caused to operate with 
an intermediate frequency in the AFC operation range, and 

interrupted. Subsequently while sweeping the frequency 
of local oscillation light 5 in a certain direction in 

a predetermined range, the output voltage of frequency 
discriminator 9 is monitored. Once the change of the 

output voltage of frequency discriminator 9 due to the 
sweep exceeds the predetermined threshold value, the AFC 

resumes for the pulling to a stable point.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical coherent
communication system, and particularly to a technique for
controlling intermediate frequency in an optical heterodyne
detection system.Optical heterodyne communication (Optical coherent
communication) system is advantageous in that a long
distance, high capacity transmission is possible because
reception sensitivity is much higher compared with a direct
detection communication system and because it is suitable
for a frequency division multiplexed system.In an heterodyne detection system, a photo detector
receives a composite signal of an input optical signal
transmitted from a transmitter and a local oscillation
light from a local oscillation light source included
in an optical receiver thereof. As a result, a beat
corresponding to a frequency difference therebetween
appears at an output of the photo detector as an electric
intermediate frequency (IF) signal. By demodulating
this IF signal, a base band signal is obtained. When
the relative frequency difference between the signal light
and the local oscillation light is not maintained constant,
fluctuation of the IF occurs, resulting in an error in a 
demodulated signal. Therefore in the optical heterodyne
detection system, the IF frequency has to be stabilized
by controlling the local oscillation light frequency.For this IF stabilization, the automatic frequency
control (AFC) technique is used. In conventional optical
heterodyne receivers, for realization of AFC, an IF signal
is put into a frequency discriminator with a characteristic
of zero-crossing at a desired IF value and the output
signal from it is fed back as an injection current to a
semiconductor laser working as a local oscillation light
source.By the way, in the optical heterodyne receiver, with
the same IF, the frequency of the local oscillation light
can be higher in some cases or lower in other cases than
the frequency of the signal light. Correspondingly there
are real and image bands. The characteristics of IF
frequency vs. frequency discriminator output voltage
utilized for AFC in the real and image bands are opposite
to each other, and stable AFC points appears in both bands.
A demodulated signal in the image band has poor quality
as well known in the art.A method for pull-in to a desired stable AFC point
in the real band is disclosed in USP No. 5,046,140.
This method involves sweeping the frequency of the local
oscillation light while making a slight frequency modulation
of local oscillation light, detecting the differential rate
