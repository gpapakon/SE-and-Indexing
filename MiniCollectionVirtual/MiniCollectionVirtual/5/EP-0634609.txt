<ABSTRACT>
1.0 Device for fastening spacers on an inner pipe element. 2.1 In the case of multiple-shell chimneys, spacers serve to stabilise the inner pipe column which, as a result of the heat loading which occurs, has to be arranged such that it can be displaced in the longitudinal and transverse directions of the chimney. Experience shows that the installation of the spacers, which is, as a rule, laborious, is often forgotten during construction of the chimney. 2.2 It is proposed to arrange a peripheral bracing ring on the outer wall of the inner pipe element, there being provided through-passage openings which run in the longitudinal direction of the pipe at mutual intervals between the bracing ring and the outer wall and into which in each case one spacer element can be inserted in a simple manner by means of an abutment leg running in the longitudinal direction of the pipe.
