<ABSTRACT>
In order to integrate electronics with the drive unit, with simple manufacture and/or assembly and a compact construction, a printed circuit board (4) (which accommodates the electronics and is at the same time constructed as a brush plate for the commutator motor) having an electronics housing (3) is arranged parallel to those housing flanges (1.1; 2.1) of the motor housing (1) or of the transmission housing (2) of the drive unit which are located one in front of the other, and is covered externally on its one axial end by the motor housing (1) and/or the electronics housing (3) and on its other axial end by the transmission housing (2).

Commutator motor gear drive unit, especially
motor vehicle window lift drive, including a motor

housing (1) having a front-side housing flange (1.1), a
gear housing (2) having a front-side housing flange

(2.1) and an electronics housing (3) having a printed
circuit board (4) with an integrated brush holder plate

for the commutator motor, having the following features:

a) the printed circuit board (4) lies substantially
parallel to the front-side housing flanges

(1.1;2.1) radially and axially within motor housing
(1) and gear housing (2);
b) the printed circuit board (4) is outwardly tightly
sealed off on its one axial front side by the motor

housing (1) and the electronics housing (3) and on
its other axial front side by the gear housing (2).
c) the electronics housing (3) has a first electronics
housing part (3.1) substantially corresponding to

the front-side contour of the housing flange (1.1)
of the commutator motor and a radially adjoining

shell-shaped second electronics housing part (3.2)
which extends in a shell shape below the motor

housing (1) of the commutator motor and which is
sealed at an open axial loading side by the correspondingly

radially expanded housing flange (2.1)
of the gear housing (2).
Drive unit according to Claim 1, having the
feature:

d) in the shell floor of the shell-shaped second

electronics housing part (3.2), there is provided a
plug receptacle (3.21) with plugs (4.1;4.2) which 

lead to the outside in sealed fashion and which are
connected to conductor leads of the printed circuit

board (4).
Drive unit according to Claim 1 and/or 2, having
the feature:

e) the printed circuit board (4), especially already
planted with electronic components extending into

the shell-shaped second electronics housing part
(3.2) or with brushes or with contact elements and

their mutual connections, is designed to be pre-assemblable
or fixable in the electronics housing

(3) or in the opposite housing flange (2.1) of the
gear housing (2).
Drive unit according to Claim 3, having the
feature:

f) the printed circuit board (4) is designed to be
plantable axially from the front side, preferably

on the commutator motor side, and to be contactable
by dip-soldering of contact pins which are passed

through its rear side.
Drive unit according to one of Claims 1-4,
having the feature:

g) sealing rims (5;6), especially sprayed-on sealing
rims, are provided, which are applied to the electronics

housing (3) on the abutment rim side and
against which the housing flange (1.1) of the motor

housing (1) or the housing flange (2.1) of the gear
housing (2) abuts.
Drive unit according to one of Claims 1-5,
having the feature:

h) a guide and/or cover sleeve (4.7) which engages
axially under the motor housing (1) and which

engages axially over at least the commutator region
of the commutator motor is shaped onto the printed

circuit board (4).
Drive unit according to one of Claims 1-6,
having the feature:
 
i) guide webs (2.11;2.12;2.13;2.14) projecting axially

are shaped onto the housing flange (2.1) of the
gear housing (2), which guide webs fit axially into

corresponding guide receptacles of the printed
circuit board (4).
Drive unit according to one of Claims 1-7,
having the feature:

j) axially projecting guide webs (4.8;4.9) are shaped
onto the printed circuit board (4), which guide

webs fit axially into corresponding guide
receptacles (2.15;2.16) of the housing flange (2.1)

of the gear housing (2).
Drive unit according to one of Claims 1-8,
having the feature:

k) the motor housing (1), the electronics housing (3),
the printed circuit board (4) and the gear housing

(2) are parts of a constructional unit which can be
fitted in axial structural assembly.
