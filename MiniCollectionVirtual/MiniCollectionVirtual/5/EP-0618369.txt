<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a barrel-type pump, arranged in which there are, in the vicinity of the last pump stage, for the purpose of increasing the efficiency, components which are designed as separate inserts in the form of a stator insert (13), a spiral insert (1) evolved radially and/or axially and a diffuser-like discharge port insert (2).

<CLAIMS>
Centrifugal pump of barrel-type construction, 
having flow-conducting stage casings (10) inserted 

between the individual pump impellers (15), characterized 
in that a stator insert (13), a radially and/or axially 

developed spiral insert (1), and a diffuser-like pressure-connection 
insert (2) are arranged inside the barrel 

casing (8) in the region of the last stage casing (10). 
Centrifugal pump according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the radially and/or axially developed spiral 

insert (1) is an integral component of a casing cap (12) 
and/or of the last stage casing (10). 
Centrifugal pump according to Claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that the spiral insert (1) is arranged 

downstream of the stator insert (13) as viewed in the 
direction of flow. 
Centrifugal pump according to Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the diffuser-like pressure-connection 

insert (2) can be inserted into the pressure connection 
(9) from the casing interior. 
Centrifugal pump according to one of Claims 1 to 
4, characterized in that the stator insert (13) is of 

bladeless design.
