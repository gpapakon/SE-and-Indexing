<ABSTRACT>
An automatic steering device is presented for controlling 
the direction of travel of an asphalt finisher during a paving 

operation. The device is provided with a laser generator (18) 
which projects a laser beam of a slit shape on a series of 

objects along the roadside which is selected to served as a 
reference line (A). An image recording device (17), a CCD 

camera, is disposed on the vehicle member (2), which records the 
projected laser light illuminating the objects and outputs a 

generated image (Ba) to a master controller (22). The master 
controller (22) determines the current deviation of the vehicle 

member (2) from the reference line (A) by the changes in the 
position of the generated image (Ba), and operates the automatic 

control device so as to steer the vehicle member (2) in the 
correct direction to permit the asphalt finisher to follow the 

reference line (A).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device according the preamble of claim 1.Efficient operation of an asphalt finisher is a key to high quality and
cost effective construction of the roadway. The asphalt finisher
[referred to as finisher hereinbelow] must be operated such that the
asphalt is levelled quickly and accurately in accordance with the
required design of the roadway. Proper steering of the finisher is a
critical factor in achieving the efficient paving operation.An automatic steering device known in the field, [for example in a
Japanese Patent Application, Second Publication, H4-32883]
comprises three photodetectors arranged on a side of the finisher to
detect a reference line along the roadside, and the data are
outputted to a controller. The controller monitors the current
positions of the finisher with respect to the reference line
periodically, and stores the respective current position data obtained
at certain time intervals. The controller compares the current
positional data with the previous positional data, and the steering
direction is determined on the basis of the comparison data and the
running period of the interval timer. The above known arrangement presented a problem that there are
only three detector devices provided for determining the travel
direction of the finisher, it was not possible to display the details of
the control process to monitor the progress of the actual paving
operation. The accuracy of control was also not adequate.A device of the type stated above is also known from DE-A-1459720.
This prior art discloses only controlling the height of the asphalt
finisher from the reference line based on changes in the horizontal
direction. Therefore by this prior art finishing can not be performed
if the road is largely curved.The object of the present invention is to present an automatic
steering device for an asphalt finisher which provides accurate
control over the steering task, and enables to monitor the details of
the actual control details on a display sreen.This object is achieved with the features of claim 1. According to the arrangement of the automatic steering
device of the present invention, the current direction of travel
of the asphalt finisher is determined in relation to a reference
line which is related to objects along the roadside. The amount
and direction of the deviation of travel of the asphalt finisher
is determined on the basis of the amount and direction of the
deviation of the current position of the vehicle member with
respect to the reference line
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A device for automatically controlling the steering operation of an
asphalt finisher (1), comprising :


a) steering wheels (7) for governing the direction of travel of said asphalt
finisher (1);
b) an actuator (11) for changing the direction of travel of said steering
wheels (7);
c) a master controller (22) for controlling the operation of said actuator
