<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method that can be carried out in parallel and automated for the production of any nucleic acid, comprising the following steps: a) coupling an oligonucleotide to a solid matrix; b) adding an additional oligonucleotide; c) performing ligation of the oligonucleotide from steps a) and b) in an orientation; d) removing excess reactants and enzymes from the reaction preparation; e) effecting cleavage of the ligation product from step c) with a restriction system that cleaves outside the recognition sequence, whereby cleavage is effected in the shortened or lengthened oligonucleotide from step a) or in the oligonucleotide from step b); f) separating the reaction mixture from the lengthened or shortened oligonucleotide from step a); g) repeating at least one steps b) to f); h) performing successive sequence-independent linkage of the fragments obtained after executing steps a) to g) until the desired product is obtained.
