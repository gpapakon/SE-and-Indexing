<ABSTRACT>
Process for the continuous preparation of homo- and copolyoxymethylenes with stable terminal groups in the homogeneous phase, in which cyclic formaldehyde oligomers are polymerised in the presence of protic acids as initiators in amounts of from 0.005 to 500 ppm in a polymerisation zone in a tubular reactor with static mixing elements, where the residence time of reaction components in this zone is from 0.1 to 10 minutes, and the polymerisation is followed directly by deactivation of the initiator, where there is a gradual transition from the polymerisation zone to the deactivator zone which is defined merely by the addition of the deactivator, and where, in addition to the deactivation, stabilisation of the chain ends is carried out in the presence of residual monomers, after which, in a subsequent degassing unit, the volatile constituents are removed from the reaction mixture. The stabilisation is carried out in the presence of alkaline substances, either at temperatures of from 150 DEG C to 250 DEG C, optionally in the presence of water or primary alcohols or at from 175 DEG C to 250 DEG C in the absence of these additives.

A process for the continuous preparation of 
germinal group-stable homo- and 

copolyoxymethylenes in the homogeneous phase, 
where, in the presence of protic acids as 

initiators, formaldehyde oligomers are polymerized 
in a first process step in a polymerization zone 

at temperature and pressure values which are known 
in practice, the initiator is deactivated in a 

second process step by addition of a deactivator, 
and the volatile constituents are removed from the 

reaction mixture in a downstream degassing unit, 
wherein the polymerization and the deactivation 

are carried out in a tubular reactor with static 
mixing elements where there is a smooth 

transition, without separation devices, between 
the polymerization zone and the deactivation zone 

which is determined exclusively by the addition of 
the deactivator, the residence time in the 

polymerization zone is from 0.1 to 10 minutes and 
in the deactivation zone is from 1 to 15 minutes, 

in addition to the deactivation, stabilization of 
the chain ends is carried out in the presence of 

residual monomers, and, where appropriate, 
additives are added after degassing has been 

carried out in a formulating extruder.  
 
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
initiator is employed in amounts of from 0.01 to 

50 ppm, in particular from 0.01 to 5 ppm, and the 
residence time in the polymerization phase is from 

0.3 to 5 minutes, in particular from 0.5 to 
2 minutes. 
The process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein a 

copolyoxymethylene is prepared in which the stabilization 
is effected by hydrolytic degradation of 

the chain ends. 
The process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein a 
homopolyoxymethylene is prepared in which the 

stabilization is effected by a capping reaction. 
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 
to 4, wherein the initiator is employed in 

dissolved, dilute form and is preferably a hetero-or 
isopolyacid. 
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 
to 5, wherein the residence time in the second 

process step is from 2 to 10 minutes and the 
pressure range is from 20 to 200 bar, preferably 

from 20 to 50 bar. 
The process as claimed in one of more of claims 1 
to 6, wherein the deactivation of the initiator is 

carried out using basic compounds in amounts of 
from 0.001 to 3.0% by weight, preferably from 0.02 

to 2.0% by weight and in particular from 0.05 to 
1.0% by weight, based on the amount of polymer. 
The process as claimed in claim 7, wherein soda, 
disodium hydrogenphosphate, aliphatic or aromatic 

primary, secondary or tertiary amines, preferably 
readily volatile tertiary amines, are employed.  

 
The process as claimed in claim 7 or 8, wherein 
the deactivation is carried out at temperatures of 

from 150°C to 250°C, preferably from 170°C to 
200°C and, in the lower temperature range, where 

appropriate, water or primary alcohols having up 
to 3 carbon atoms are employed in an amount of 

from 0.5 to 5% by weight, based on the amount of 
polymer, in addition to the basic compounds. 
The process as claimed in claim 7 or 8, wherein 
the deactivation is carried out at temperatures of 

from 175°C to 250°C, preferably from 175°C to 
200°C, the deactivation taking place in the 

absence of water or primary alcohols. 
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 
to 10, wherein additives in the form of 

stabilizers, nucleating agents, pigments, 
lubricants and fillers are added after the 

degassing.
