<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to data processing and in 
particular to apparatus, systems and methods for distributed processing. As the tasks computing systems are required to perform increase in 
complexity, the burdens on the central processing unit (CPU), the size of the 
system memory, and the traffic on the system address and data buses all 
correspondingly increase. In particular, many types of tasks associated with 
matrix mathematics, speech synthesis, image signal processing, and digital 
signal processing are computationally intensive, often requiring the 
execution of a large number of basic arithmetic operations before a final 
result is obtained. For example, a typical matrix multiplication may require 
the performance of a substantial number of multiplications and additions, 
depending on the sizes of the matrices involved. In addition, the resulting 
intermediate sums and products must be stored and retrieved as the 
operations proceed. Thus, the CPU becomes burdened not only with the task 
of performing all arithmetic operations but also with the task of controlling 
the transfer of data to and from memory. The memory in turn must be large 
enough to handle the initial raw data and all the intermediate results. 
Finally, the traffic on the address and data buses substantially increases as 
data and results are exchanged between the memory and the CPU. Thus, the need has arisen for apparatus, systems and methods which 
more efficiently handle computationally intensive applications. Such 
apparatus, systems and methods, should ease CPU task burdens, minimize 
the amount of memory required and efficiently use bus bandwidth. Further, 
such apparatus, systems and methods should be compatible with currently 
available device and system configurations.  According to the invention, an active memory device is provided which 
includes a data memory including rows and columns of storage locations for 
holding raw data and computational results. A broadcast memory is further 
provided which includes rows and columns of storage locations for holding 
control instructions and computational arguments. A data path is provided 
which is operable to supply selected computational arguments received from 
the broadcast memory to selected words of raw data received from the data 
memory and provide computational results in response. Control circuitry is 
additionally provided which is operable in response to control instructions 
received from the broadcast memory to control the transfer of
