<ABSTRACT>
The object of the invention is to obtain granulated washing and cleaning agents having the usual composition, a primary washing and cleaning power comparable to the primary washing and cleaning power of usual commercially-available products, but whose secondary washing power has big advantages. For that purpose, agents are used which contain determined polymer polycarboxylates as granulated builder components. Preferred textile washing agents contain 8 to 40 % by weight anionic and non-ionic surfactants, including soap, 15 to 45 % by weight zeolite and/or crystalline layered silicates, in particular zeolite, 0.5 to 8 % by weight sodium or potassium carbonate and 0.5 to 15 % by weight, preferably 2 to 10 % by weight, in particular 3 to 5 % by weight, granulated polymer polycarboxylates. These agents may be produced in the usual manner by mixing at least two granulated components, of which one contains the polymer polycarboxylate.

<CLAIMS>
A detergent, more particularly a laundry detergent, containing anionic 
and/or nonionic surfactants and phosphate-free builders, inorganic salts and 

polymeric polycarboxylates, characterized in that it contains at least two 
granular components of which the first contains anionic and/or nonionic 

surfactants, phosphate-free builders and inorganic salts and the second is an 
added component of polymeric polycarboxylates in granular form, the 

detergent containing alkali metal carbonates in quantities below 10% by 
weight, based on the detergent as a whole, and showing an improved 

incrustation-inhibiting effect. 
A detergent as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that it contains 
zeolite and/or crystalline layer silicates corresponding to general formula (I) 

NaMSi

O, where M is sodium or hydrogen, x is a number of 1.9 to 4 
and y is a number of 0 to 20, in quantities of 10 to 60% by weight as 

phosphate-free builders, the ratio by weight of builders to granular polymeric 
polycarboxylates being 30:1 to 1:1, preferably 20:1 to 2:1 and more preferably 

10:1 1 to 3:1. 
A detergent as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the 
granular polymeric polycarboxylates have an apparent density of 350 to 850 

g/l and preferably 400 to 750 g/l and contain no particles below 50 µm in size 
and preferably no particles below 100 µm in size, at most 5% of the particles 

being lager than 1,000 µm in size and preferably at most 3% by weight of the 
particles being larger than 1,000 µm in size. 
A detergent as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that it 
contains granular polymeric polycarboxylates in the form of copolymeric salts 

of acrylic acid with maleic acid. 
A detergent as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that it 
contains 8 to 40% by weight, preferably 10 to 35% by weight and more 

preferably 12 to 28% by weight of anionic and nonionic surfactants, including 
soap, 15 to 45% by weight and preferably 20 to 40% by weight of zeolite  

 
and/or crystalline layer silicates, more especially zeolite, 0.5 to 8% by weight 

of sodium or potassium carbonate and 0.5 to 15% by weight, preferably 2 to 
10% by weight and more preferably 3 to 8% by weight of granular polymeric 

polycarboxylates. 
A detergent as claimed in any of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that it 
contains other typical ingredients of detergents, preferably peroxy bleaching 

agents, bleach activators, inorganic salts, enzymes and polycarboxylates, in 
the usual quantities, but is preferably free from phosphonates. 
A detergent as claimed in any of claims 1 to 6, characterized in that it 
has an apparent density of 300 to 1,100 g/l and preferably between 500 and 

1,000 g/l and consists in particular of at least three granular components of 
which one contains the polymeric polycarboxylate. 
A process for the production of the granular detergent claimed in any 
of claims 1 to 7, characterized in that it is obtained by mixing at least two 

granular components of which one contains the polymeric polycarboxylate. 
A process as claimed in claim 8, characterized in that the other 
granular component, which preferably contains anionic surfactants, optionally 

nonionic surfactants, builders and inorganic salts, is produced by spray 
drying. 
A process as claimed in claim 8, characterized in that the other 
granular component, which preferably contains anionic surfactants and 

nonionic surfactants, builders, inorganic salts and optionally peroxy bleaching 
agents, is produced by a granulation or extrusion process. 
A process for the production of a granular detergent as claimed in any 
of claims 1 to 7, characterized in that it is produced by extrusion, the granular 

polymeric polycarboxylate being part of the mixture to be extruded.
