<ABSTRACT>
A low voltage fully differential operational 
amplifier with improved common mode circuitry for low 

supply voltage applications. The amplifier includes 
inverting and non-inverting inputs and dual-ended 

inverted and non-inverted outputs. The amplifier also 
includes source transistors for pushing the output and 

sink transistors for pulling the output to obtain 
particular output voltage swing. Connections between 

the inputs and outputs include DC biasing circuitry. 
In low supply voltage applications, voltage drop due to 

transistors of amplifier circuitry can be significant 
and can affect possible range of output voltage swing. 

The DC biasing circuitry includes four identically 
sized n-channel transistors; three of the n-channel 

transistors receive a second bias current input and one 
of the n-channel transistors receives a first bias 

current input, identical to the first; three 
identically sized n-channel cascode transistors are 

connected to the n-channel transistor that receives the 
first bias current input and to two of the n-channel 

transistors receiving the second bias current input; 
the other n-channel transistor receives the second bias 

current input and is connected to a correcting  
 

transistor of select size and characteristics. The 
correcting transistor serves to maintain mirrored 

currents between each of the source transistors and 
each of the sink transistors to eliminate the 

implications of inequivalent voltage drop across 
corresponding series of transistors in the amplifier so 

that the range of output voltage swing, even in low 
supply voltage applications, closely approaches the 

value of the power supply voltage. The common mode 
circuitry of the amplifier provides a high level of 

common mode signal reconstruction. The common mode 
circuitry accepts inputs of a signal indicative of the 

difference between the outputs and an analog reference 
voltage input. Based on those inputs, the common mode 

circuitry either pushes or pulls the output stage of 
the amplifier to draw the outputs close to the voltage 

of the analog reference input. The common mode 
circuitry is designed to also mirror currents in a 

manner which eliminates current mismatch between the 
amplifier core and the common mode circuitry, which 

mismatch can otherwise cause reconstruction errors in 
the voltages of the outputs. The common mode 

circuitry, together with the DC biasing circuitry, 
maximize current matching between the amplifier core 

and the common mode circuitry.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to fully differential
amplifiers for use as operational amplifiers, and more
particularly, to fully differential operational
amplifier for low power supply operation, having a
unique DC biasing scheme and incorporating a new common
mode reconstruction technique.Fully differential amplifiers are common
components of electronic devices. A fully differential
amplifier is an amplifier with two inputs and two
outputs. The outputs are amplified versions of the
inputs. These amplifiers serve to amplify the two 
input signals to the amplifier, yielding dual amplified
outputs.Fully differential amplifiers are important in
many applications where weak signals (for example, in
low supply voltage arrangements) may be contaminated by
"pickup" and other miscellaneous noise. In the case of
many low supply voltage operations, like battery
powered or portable communication devices, if a single-ended
input (i.e., a single, individual input signal
with an absolute value) is input and used by an
amplifier, undesired "pickup" and noise which are input
with that signal may be also picked up and amplified
along with the desired input signal. In that event,
output from the amplifier will vary from desired output
depending upon the particular "pickup" or other noise.
If, on the other hand, the amplifier is a fully
differential amplifier and so has dual inputs and dual
outputs, then both inputs to the amplifier pick up the
same "pickup" or noise signals at the same time and
those "pickups" or noise signals are amplified along
with the desired input signals to give the respective
outputs. In a difference determination between the two
outputs, ther the amplified "pickup"/noise components
of the outputs cancel each other and there is no 
resulting differential amplification effect from or of
these undesired signals.Fully differential amplifiers generally include
common mode circuitry. In the typical fully
differential amplifier, the common mode circuitry
receives a reference analog voltage signal and serves
to pull or push the outputs of the fully differential
amplifiers as necessary to bring the voltages of the
outputs near that of the reference analog voltage
signal. The process of pulling or pushing to bring the
two output signal voltages near the reference analog
voltage is referred to as "common mode reconstruction".
Effective common mode reconstruction is a desired
attribute of fully differential amplifiers.In simplistic form and for purposes of a better
understanding hereof, a single stage fully
