<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is a modification to conventional 
tow processing machinery 2 and filter rod making machinery 6 which 

utilizes a top crimper 4 and a bottom crimper 4a alone or in 
combination, or a crimper and two sources of tow in combination to 

allow the machinery to be capable of producing different types of 
filters without major structural changes to the existing 

machinery.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is a modification to standard 
filter making machinery. The standard machinery 
produces cigarette filters by taking the output of a 
tow processing machine to feed the input of a filter 
rod maker. If a spiral filter is desired, a spiral 
tongue may be present in the filter rod maker. Thesing U.S. Patent No. 5,012,829 
reveals a filter which also has three concentric 
layers, the Thesing filter differs in that the middle 
layer of paper is plugwrap that is used to stabilize 
the inner most material (Col. 5, line 19-24). The 
Thesing patent adds flavorants to at least one 
component of the filter, and only chemical plasticizers 
and/or wrapping can be used to stabilize the filter. 
(Col. 2, line 5-12) Thus, in Thesing, the purpose of 
the additional layer of plugwrap is as a stabilizer. It has been desired to modify 
the area between the tow processing machinery and 
filter rod maker to allow the machinery to be capable 
of producing different types of filters without major 
structural changes. It has also been desired to add a second tow 
processing line to the existing tow processing 
machinery so that the machinery will be capable of 
producing different types of filters without major 
structural changes. It has also been desired to obtain filters 
with a higher degree of filtration than is available  
 
with other methods of filter manufacture known in the 
industry. It has also been desired 
to modify standard filter making 
machinery to incorporate new elements so that a filter 
assembly consisting of paper and tow joined together in 
various arrangements is provided. It has also been desired to 
provide machinery capable of producing at least six 
different types of filters depending upon which new 
elements and combinations of new elements are employed. 
These six filters are conventional and would be known 
to one of skill in the art. It has also been desired to 
provide machinery capable of producing filter 
assemblies with a desired degree of filtration. It has also been desired to 
provide machinery capable of producing different types 
of filters without major structural modifications and 
with minimal installation impact. In accordance with the present invention 
modifications can be made to the area 
between the tow processing machinery and the filter rod 
maker or to the tow processing 
machinery. Five of the six embodiments described are 
modifications to the area between the tow processing 
machinery and the filter rod maker are provided. These 
five modifications
