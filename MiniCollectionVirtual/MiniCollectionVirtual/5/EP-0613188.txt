<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a charge
transfer device and a method for producing the same,
and more particularly to a charge transfer device
including an FDA (Floating Diffusion Amplifier) type
charge detecting section and a method for producing the
same.Figure 6 shows in part a conventional charge
transfer device 101. As is shown in Figure 6, the
charge transfer device 101 includes a transfer
channel 102 for transferring a charge, a charge detecting
section 103 for detecting a charge, and a source
follower amplifier 104. Figure 7 is a circuit diagram
showing the source follower amplifier 104. As is shown
in Figure 7, the source follower amplifier 104 includes
transistors Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4. The transistors Q2 and
Q3 are not shown in Figure 6 for conciseness and clarity.A charge is transferred in the transfer
channel 102 when a two-phase clock pulse of 1 and 2
is applied to transfer electrodes 105. The charge in
the transfer channel 102 is transferred to the charge
detecting section 103 in accordance with a timing of an
output gate pulse OG applied to an electrode 106, and
is stored in the charge detecting section 103. The
signal charge is converted into an output signal in the
form of a voltage at the source follower amplifier 104
(charge/voltage conversion). More specifically, a 
voltage which is in proportion to the amount of the
charge stored in the charge detecting section 103 is
detected by the transistor Q1 in the source follower
amplifier 104, and is amplified in the source follower
amplifier 104 so as to be detected as an output signal.
When the output signal is detected, the charge in a
charge detecting section 103 is drained to a reset
drain RD in accordance with a timing of a reset gate
pulse RG.Hereinafter, the charge detecting section 103
and the transistor Q1 will be described in more detail,
with reference to Figure 8. Figure 8 is a view showing
an 8 - 8 cross section of the charge transfer
device 101 shown in Figure 6. As is shown in Figure 8,
a P--type first diffusion layer 111 is formed in a
semiconductor substrate 110. The charge detecting
section 103 is composed of an N+-type floating diffusion
layer 112 formed in the first diffusion layer 111.
Second diffusion layers 113 to 115 are also formed in
the first diffusion layer 111.The transistor Q1 includes a portion 116 of
the first diffusion layer 111 as a channel thereof, the
portion 116 being interposed between the second diffusion
layers 114 and 115. The transistor Q1 further
includes a gate insulating film 117 formed on
