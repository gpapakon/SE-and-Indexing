<ABSTRACT>
Crosslinked networks of (meth)acrylate (co)polymers, and a method of making the networks, are provided in which a photoiniferter-derived homopolymer, random copolymer or block copolymer is dissolved in a compatible monomer mixture along with a radiation-sensitive photoinitiator and crosslinker. The polymer-monomer mixture is coated onto a suitable web and cured via ultraviolet radiation to yield a crosslinked network resulting from polymerization of monomers along with incorporation of the active photoiniferter polymer. The networks exhibit excellent adhesive properties. When the photoiniferter polymer is a homopolymer, a random copolymer or an AB-type diblock copolymer, a pressure-sensitive adhesive results. When the photoiniferter polymer is a homopolymer or a random copolymer, the resulting adhesive exhibits excellent vibration-damping characteristics. When the photoiniferter polymer is an ABA-type triblock copolymer, a structural adhesive is obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
 ULTRAVIOLET RADIATION CURABLE ACRY ATE PRESSURE-SENSπ E ADHESIVE COMPOSITIONSField of the InventionThe present invention relates to controllably curable adhesive compositions which depending upon the particular formulation can upon cure provide polymers exhibiting pressure-sensitive adhesive properties, and optionally vibration damping properties, and optionally structural adhesive properties.Background of the InventionAcrylate pressure-sensitive adhesives are well known in the art. Ulrich (U.S. Reissue No. 24,906) describes alkyl acrylate copolymers comprising a predominant amount of C4- to C^alkyl esters of acrylic acid and a minor amount of a copolymerizable polar monomer such as acrylic acid. Such adhesives are widely popular due to their availability, low cost, and ability to provide the requisite fourfold balance of adhesion, cohesion, stretchiness, and elasticity known to be required for an effective pressure-sensitive adhesive. Subsequent references suggest various modifications in the basic acrylic polymer to enhance various physical properties in the PSA composition. For example, Martens et al. (U.S. Patent No. 4,181,752) discloses the exposure of an acrylic polymer to ultraviolet radiation to achieve crosslinking and enhance shear strength. Harlan (U.S. Patent No. 3,239,478) discloses the preparation of block or segmented copolymers to provide PSA compositions which have improved strength and overall PSA properties because of phase separation of soft butadiene or butadiene-isoprene polymer blocks and hard polystyrene blocks of the block copolymer. Another well-known method of modifying acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesives is to form a syrup comprising a pre-formed acrylic polymer or oligomer and an acrylic monomer. The pre-formed polymer can be inert or reactive under subsequent polymerization or crosslinking reactions. Japanese Patent No. 56-161,484 describes the thermal free-radical polymerization of a vinyl monomer in the presence of an acrylic polymer to produce an acrylic pressure-sensitive hot-melt adhesive. Glennon (U.S. Patent No. 4,243,500) describes an adhesive produced by dissolving an elastomer in an acrylate ester monomer wherein a significant amount of added tackifier is 

required to obtain satisfactory adhesion levels. Canadian Patent No. 1,192,688 discloses an adhesive composition comprising a high glass transition temperature (Ts) acrylic monomer in which is dispersed a core-shell polymer, to produce a 100% reactive fluid adhesive on subsequent curing of the
