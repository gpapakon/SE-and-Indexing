<DESCRIPTION>
The catalyst industry is a multi-billion dollar industry
which continues to grow. Catalysts are used in virtually all
chemical processes, including those used to make industrial
chemicals, oil products and pharmaceuticals. A significant
amount of catalysts are solid state materials containing a
metal or a metal compound such as a metal oxide. A
co-precipitation process is generally employed to manufacture
such catalysts. Other metal based materials such as
superconductors, solid state electrolytes and piezo-electric
materials are formed in a similar manner using a
co-precipitation process. The co-precipitation method,
however, has the disadvantages of producing materials which
are not exceptionally homogeneous and the reproducibility of
the process is often poor.GB-A-408 891 describes a process of producing
fine-grained precipitates which consist in causing
liquid components to meet and spraying them at the
moment when they meet or directly afterwards, but
before the precipitating action is finished, so as to
obtain fine drops of spray, and collecting the spray
containing the precipitate.As a result, there is a need for a process to synthesize
such materials which is both easily reproducible and which
provides solid state materials such as catalysts in a high
state of phase purity.Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a process
for producing solid state materials such as catalysts,
piezoelectric materials, superconductors, and electrolytes,
which process is easily reproducible and results in materials
of exceptionally high phase purity with homogeneously dispersed
metal components. The process generally comprises the 
steps of : (1) subjecting a metal-containing solution to
high pressure and high shear forces in the presence of a
precipitating agent by causing two stream to impinge upon
each other at a pressure of 6.9x106 to 345x106 Pa over
atmospheric pressure (1,000 to 5,000 psig) and at a
velocity of at least 40 meters/second and (2)
depressurizing the solution to cause precipitation of the
solide state material. More specifically, the process
entails the steps of : (1) mixing together a metal
solution such as a metal salt solution and a solution
containing a precipitating agent to form a mixed solution, (2)
pressurizing the mixed solution, (3) passing the pressurized
mixed solution into a fluidizer apparatus wherein high shear
forces act on the mixed solution causing homogeneous mixing
thereof, (4) depressurizing the mixed solution sufficiently
rapidly so as to cause the generation of
