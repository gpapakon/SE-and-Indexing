<ABSTRACT>
According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a 
display 

panel characterised by a main panel component having a front and a rear 
region and at least one pair of displaceable clips located on the 

rear region of 
the main panel component at or near the edges thereof, each clip including a 

hook shaped component normally extending away from, but with its jaw 
opening towards the panel when the clip is in its rest position; 

the hook 
shaped components of the pair, at least in the rest position, facing towards 

one another and being separated from one another by a predetermined pitch 
distance; each hook shaped component being further adapted for 

displacement to a mounting position away from the rest position such that in 
the mounting position they are separated from one another by a slightly 

larger amount than the predetermined pitch distance. 
According to one further aspect of the present invention there is 
provided a 

skeleton framework to receive a display panel according to the first aspect, 
wherein the skeleton frame work defines a plurality of spaced 

parallel channels ,the adjacent channels being spaced from one another 
by a 

distance corresponding to the predetermined pitch distance, each channel 
being of generally C-shaped cross section with the jaws of the C facing 

outwardly to receive a clip of the or each panel.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a display panel and to a mounting system therefore. 
It is particularly concerned with a system whereby a panel for use in 
connection with a display, exhibition, or sign or indeed in any application 
where a panel is readily mounted on a supporting frame. In addition the 
invention is concerned with a framework on which a display panel can be 
mounted and to an assembly comprising such a framework supporting one or 
more such panels. In displays and exhibitions there arises a need for a structure to be created to 
display information, exhibits and representations in a manner reflecting not 
only the characteristics of the products or services involved but also on the 
exhibitor. The structure should be readily assembled with accurate 
alignment of component parts and be readily furnished with material and 
information for display. Once in use the structure should maintain alignment 
of its component parts despite minor impacts so as to avoid a deterioration in 
overall or detailed appearance. It is also desirable that the structure should 
be readily disassembled for further use. This last point can involve a 
considerable cost saving since. It is not unknown for an exhibition structure 
having been designed and fabricated at considerable cost and erected and 
used for a period of a few days at an exhibition has to be destroyed at the end 
of the exhibition since it was not readily dismantled. According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided display 
panel characterised by a main panel component having a front and a rear 
region; and at least one pair of displaceable clips located on the rear region of 
the main panel component at or near the edges thereof; each clip including a 
hook shaped component normally extending away from but with its jaw 
opening towards the panel when the clip is in its rest position; the hook 
shaped components of the pair, at least in the rest position, facing towards  
 
one another and being separated from one another by a predetermined pitch 
distance; each hook shaped component being further adapted for 
displacement to a mounting position away from the rest position such that in 
the mounting position they are separated from one another by a slightly 
larger amount than the predetermined pitch distance. According to a first preferred version of the present invention each clip is an 
elongate member having a section in the form of a question mark with a stem 
providing for the mounting of the clip on the panel and a curved

<CLAIMS>
A display panel characterised by a main panel component having a 
front and a rear region; and at least one pair of displaceable clips 

located on the rear region of the main panel component at or near the 
edges thereof; each clip including a hook shaped component normally 

extending away from but with its jaw opening towards the panel when 
the clip is in its rest position; the hook shaped components of the pair, 

at least in the rest position, facing towards one another and being 
separated from one another by a predetermined pitch distance; each 

hook shaped component being further adapted for displacement to a 
mounting position away from the rest position such that in the 

mounting position they are separated from one another by a slightly 
larger amount than the predetermined pitch distance. 
A display panel as claimed in Claim 1 characterised in that each clip is 
an elongate member having a section in the form of a question mark 

with a stem providing for the mounting of the clip on the panel and a 
curved part forming the hook shaped component; the clip being 

secured to the panel by way of a part of the stem remote from the hook 
shaped component. 
A display panel as claimed in Claim 2 characterised in that the stem is 
in two parts- a central and a mounting part; the central part being 

linked at one end to the hook shaped component and at the other end 
to the mounting part, the mounting part being set at a mounting angle 

to the central part; the mounting part serving to attach the clip to the 
panel so that the hook shaped component is set at a corresponding 

angle to the mounting angle to the panel. 
A display panel as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2 characterised in that 
the panel is of generally rectangular shape with the clips extending on 

the first and third sides and the second and fourth sides are provided 
with light trapping means so that when juxtaposed with a similar 

panel on the second or fourth sides the sides of the juxtaposed panels 
serve to prevent the passage of stray light from one side of the panel to 

the other. 
A display panel as claimed in any preceding claim characterised in 
that the panel is fabricated, at least in part, from plastics material, 

wood, glass or metal. 
A display panel as claimed in any preceding claim characterised in 
that each clip is demountably attached to the panel. 
A display panel as claimed in Claim1, Claim 2, Claim 3 or Claim 4 
characterised in that the clip is permanently secured to the panel. 
A display panel as claimed in any preceding claim characterised in 
that the clip is of plastics material. 
A skeleton framework to receive a display panel according to any 
preceding characterised by a skeleton frame work defining a plurality 

of spaced parallel channels the adjacent channels being spaced from 
one another by a distance corresponding to the predetermined pitch 

distance; each channel being of generally C-shaped cross section with 
the jaws of the C facing outwardly to receive a clip of the or each 

panel. 
An assembled display unit comprising a skeleton framework as 
claimed in Claim 9 equipped with display panels as claimed in any of 

preceding claims 1 to 8. 
An assembled display unit as claimed in Claim 10 wherein at least one 
display panel is equipped with a device requiring a supply of a 

service- such as electricity, gas, compressed air, water, and the 
framework serves to locate a supply line for the service terminating at 

the panel to provide for the supply of the service thereto.
