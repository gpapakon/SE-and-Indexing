<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to drilling fluid additives 
that suppress clay swelling within a subterranean well 

and to methods for controlling clay swelling during the 
drilling of a subterranean well. In one embodiment 

trihydroxy alkyl amine is reacted with an alkyl halide or 
a water soluble quaternary amine to form a quaternized 

trihydroxy alkyl amine. The reaction products can also 
include condensed reaction products of quaternized 

trihydroxy alkyl amines. In another embodiment a choline 
derivative is used. The quaternized reaction products 

and choline derivatives are characterized by low toxicity 
and compatibility with anionic drilling fluid components. 

The products are added to water base drilling fluids 
which are circulated throughout a well. The drilling 

fluid additives and the method of controlling clay 
swelling provide for improved control of the rheological 

properties of drilling fluids along with increased 
environmental and drilling fluid compatibility.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to drilling fluids
which suppress clay swelling within a subterranean well
during the drilling process. The invention is
particularly directed to hydration-inhibiting
drilling fluids comprising hydroxyalkyl quaternary
ammonium compounds which are compatible with anionic
polymers typically found in or added to drilling fluids
and are environmentally acceptable.In rotary drilling of subterranean wells numerous
functions and characteristics are expected of a drilling
fluid. A drilling fluid should circulate throughout the
well and carry cuttings from beneath the bit, transport
the cuttings up the annulus, and allow their separation
at the surface. At the same time, the drilling fluid is
expected to cool and clean the drill bit, reduce friction
between the drill string and the sides of the hole, and
maintain stability in the borehole's uncased sections.
The drilling fluid should also form a thin, low-permeability
filter cake that seals openings in
formations penetrated by the bit and act to reduce the
unwanted influx of formation fluids from permeable rocks.Drilling fluids are typically classified according
to their base material or primary continuous phase. In
oil-base fluids, solid particles are suspended in oil, 
and water or brine may be emulsified with the oil. The
oil is typically the continuous phase. In water-base
fluids, solid particles are suspended in water or brine,
and oil may be emulsified in the water. Water is the
continuous phase. Oil-base fluids are generally more
effective in stabilizing water-sensitive shales than
water-base fluids. However, environmental concerns have
limited the use of oil-base drilling fluids.
Accordingly, oil drilling companies have increasingly
focused on water-base fluids.Three types of solids are usually found in water-base
drilling fluids: (1) clays and organic colloids
added to provide necessary viscosity and filtration
properties, (2) heavy minerals whose function is to
increase the drilling fluid's density, and (3) formation
solids that become dispersed in the drilling fluid during
the drilling operation.The formation solids that become dispersed in a
drilling fluid are typically the cuttings produced by the
drill bit's action and the solids produced by borehole
instability. Where the formation solids are clay
minerals that swell, the presence of such solids in the
drilling fluid can greatly increase drilling time and
costs. The overall increase in bulk volume accompanying
clay swelling impedes removal of cuttings from beneath
the drill
