<ABSTRACT>
A base metal repair tape (11) includes a first layer (13) formed braze alloy bonded together with fibrillated polytetrafluoroethylene, a second layer (14) formed from powdered base metal bonded together by fibrillated polytetrafluoroethylene and a third layer (15) comprising a brazing alloy bonded together by fibrillated polytetrafluoroethylene. This is used to repair base metal by placing the layer (15) on the base metal and brazing the base metal powder so that the brazing alloy melts and diffuses into the base metal powder bonding it to the surface of the article. This permits the braze powder to be bonded to the base metal surface with minimal distance between the base powder particles. The number of alternating layers of base metal (22) and braze alloy (23) can be increased to increase the thickness of the repair. This can also be used to form small intricate parts.

<DESCRIPTION>
Metal Repair TapeBackground of the InventionMetal parts, for example, those used in jet engines are generally required to meet very precise tolerances. Damage to metal parts during use or during machining where a part is overmachined can prevent the part from falling within the set tolerances and require that the part be repaired or replaced. To repair such damage, new metal must be brazed to the surface of the part.The new metal needs to have a composition similar to the base metal. Thus, diffusion braze fillers are combined with powder base metal to provide acomposition which brazes to the base metal at a temperature lower than the melting point or softening point of the base metal.Typically, this was done by forming a slurry which includes the powdered base metal, powdered diffusion braze filler and a binder which could be,for example, a methacrylate binder, an alginate binder or the like. These systems provide acceptable results. However, well defined geometries needed for somerepairs were very difficult to obtain. 

 Further, slurries such as these are difficult to use. The binder systemmust be initially mixed. Then the precise amount of base metal and diffusion filler must be combined. This has a very limited shelf life. It cannot be mass produced for sale and subsequent use. It must be prepared by the actual user which creates the potential problem of human error.Also, the boron typically used in the braze alloy could localize orpuddle on the surface of the part. This weakens the base metal and can destroythe part. Slurries are also difficult to conform, resulting in poor ability for largebuild-up repairs.Also, with oxygen sensitive alloys such as those that include titanium, aluminum, hafnium, and chromium, heating above 800 Â°F can cause oxide formation. These oxides are not normally reducible in brazing furnaces. Mostbraze furnaces are designed to either operate in the vacuum or in a hydrogen atmosphere. However, there is frequently a trace amount of oxygen remaining in the furnace that can react with these metals. To avoid this problem, such alloys containing these oxygen sensitive metals are nickel coated prior to base metalrepair. This nickel precoating is undesirable simply because it requires an extra step or even two extra steps frequently requiring masking of portions that are notto be nickel coated. Summary of the inventionAccordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a base metal repair which is not a slurry and which does not require nickel precoating.
