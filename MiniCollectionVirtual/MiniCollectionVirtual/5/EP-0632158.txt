<ABSTRACT>
Preparing waste paper with a large proportion of wax-coated material involves decomposing the waste paper in a pulp dissolver at min. 60 deg. C. After a pre-cleaning process and possibly thinning with heated water, the waste wate suspension is flotated at 60-100 deg. C so that a major proportion of the wax is sepd. with the flotated material.

<CLAIMS>
Process for the treatment of waste paper a large portion of 
which is coated in wax, 
characterised in that
 the waste paper 
is decomposed in a material solvent at a temperature of at least 

60°C, and that, following pre-cleansing for the purpose of 
separating large impurities and, if appropriate, diluting with 

suitably heated water, the waste paper suspension is floated at 
a temperature between 60 and 100°C so that a large portion of 

the wax is separated with the flotate. 
Process according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the 
solution of waste paper is dissolved in the material solvent at a 

temperature between 60 and 120°C. 
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 multistage 
flotation is applied. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in 
that
 the flotation takes place at temperatures between 65 and 
95°C. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in 
that
 the waste paper is dissolved in the material solvent in a 
temperature range between 90° and 120°C.
