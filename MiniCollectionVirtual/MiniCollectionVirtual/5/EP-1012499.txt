<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for ice seeding during cryopreservation of biological samples such as cells, harvested tissues, and cellular biological constructs such as culture tissue equivalents wherein ice seeding is performed by discharging a liquefied or chilled gas (60) from a nozzle (21) to the surface of a container (40) containing said biological sample in cryopreservative. Inside a freezing chamber (70), containers (40) are placed on racks (30) that are located proximal to a sprayrail (20) containing nozzles (21). Ice seeding is performed by discharge of liquefied or chilled gas (60) from the nozzles to the container surface at the solid-liquid equilibrium temperature of the cryopreservative. Localized cooling of the container surface by the discharge results in ice seed formation within the container (40).

<DESCRIPTION>
 ICE SEEDING APPARATUS FOR CRYOPRESERVATION SYSTEMSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the Invention: This invention relates to an ice seeding apparatus for cryopreservation systems for biological samples such as cells, harvested tissue and cellular biological constructs such as cultured tissue equivalents. Ice seeding in a cryopreservation protocol initiates the formation of ice that is controllable to allow for maximal viability of the tissue or tissue equivalent to be cryopreserved after it has been subsequently thawed. By use of the cryopreservation technology, either cryopreserved harvested tissue or cryopreserved cultured tissue may be stored for indefinite periods of time prior to use. The cultured tissue is an in vitro model of the equivalent human tissue, which, when retrieved from storage, can be used for transplantation or implantation, in vivo, or for screening compounds in vitro.2. Brief Description of the Background of the Invention: Heretofore, the cryopreservation of cadaver tissue and cultured tissue equivalents for the purposes of preserving the viability of the cells in the tissue has been achieved, but with limited success. Currently, the storage time of cellular biological materials is extended by cooling to "cryogenic" temperatures. The transition from the liquid into the solid state by lowering the temperature of the system can take place either as crystallization (ice), involving an orderly arrangement of water molecules, or as vitrification or amorphization (glass formation), in the absence of such an orderly arrangement of crystalline phase. The challenge for a cryobiologist is to bring cells to cryogenic temperatures and then return them to physiological conditions without injuring them.There are two basic approaches to cryopreservation of cells and tissues: freeze-thaw and vitrification. In freeze-thaw techniques, the extracellular solution is frozen (i.e., in crystalline form), but steps are taken to minimize the intracellular ice formation. In vitrification procedures, there is an attempt to prevent crystalline ice formation throughout the cells and tissue. The former approach is 

problematic in that if ice crystals are formed inside the cells, they are detrimental to cell viability upon thawing. However, cells could survive a freeze-thaw cycle if they are cooled at controlled rates in the presence of non-toxic levels of cryoprotectants. The latter approach of vitrification seeks to avoid potentially damaging affects of intra- and extracellular ice by depressing ice
