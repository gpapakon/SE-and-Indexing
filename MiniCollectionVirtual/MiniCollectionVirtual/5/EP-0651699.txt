<ABSTRACT>
A dual ovenable food product container is formed from a coated or uncoated paperboard substrate to which is applied a precoat layer and a topcoat layer. The precoat is formed from an aqueous emulsion copolymer such as ethylene vinyl acetate while the top coat is formed from an aqueous emulsion which is a copolymer of one or a mixture of styrenated acrylic copolymers. The Tg of the precoat should be in the range of 0  C to 25  C, while the Tg of the top coat layer is in the range of about 10  C to 60  C.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DUALOVENABLEFOODCONTAINERBackground of the InventionThe invention relates to polymer coated paperboard products, and more particularly to dual ovenable paperboard products.Many food items are precooked and frozen for long term storage before cooking. In the past foods were often packaged in aluminum cooking trays. Such containers have become less popular with the increasing popularity of microwave ovens since metal containers cannot normally be used for microwave cooking. There is now a desire in the industry to package frozen and prepare foods in containers which are dual ovenable, that is able to be used in both microwave and conventional ovens.Paperboard-based containers have thus become widely used as containers for prepared foods. Such materials offer the advantages of being microwavable as well as suited for use in conventional ovens. In some instances, however, plain paperboard is not able to be exposed to temperatures typically encountered during cooking. Certain polymer based coatings have been developed for application to paperboard to reduce the charrability of the container. One commonly used coating is a polyester material. This contributes moderate heat stability to the paperboard so that it is able to resist charring up to about 400°F(203° C). One disadvantage of this material is that it can be difficult to recycle and thus may raise environmental concerns. Further, the use of polyester coatings is relatively expensive and does not afford ideal heat stability as paperboard coated with polyester can warp during heating.U.S. Patent No. 4,421,825 discloses a paperboard product coated with a first layer which includes titanium dioxide, a second layer of an acrylic copolymer and an organic solvent, and one or more outer layers comprising a clear acrylic copolymer also dissolved in an organic solvent. Paperboard to which such coatings have been applied are reported to be able to resist charring at temperatures up to 205°C (approximately 400 °F). However, the coating process can present environmental problems because the organic solvent is volatized during the drying process. The use of a titanium dioxide pigment in the first coating can also reduce the aesthetics of the resulting food as the pigmented coating tends to be brittle and staining can result in areas where the container has been folded or scored.It would thus be advantageous to provide coated paperboard products which have high temperature stability and which offer ease of manufacture. 

 Accordingly, it is an object of the
