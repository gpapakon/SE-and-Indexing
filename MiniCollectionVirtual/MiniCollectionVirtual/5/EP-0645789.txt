<ABSTRACT>
A position switch is specified having a switch housing (1) for fastening on an object, which contains the switching mechanism and the electrical contacts and which is provided with a covering cap, which position switch can be produced at relatively low cost, can be used in a flexible manner and can easily be installed (assembled), while complying with the conditions for destruction resistance and reliability against being outwitted. This object is achieved in that the switch housing is arranged in a fastening part (2), which at least partially engages around said switch housing, in such a manner that it can be displaced in rotation and longitudinally before fastening, and can be fastened in the fastening part.

Position switch having a switch housing (1) for fixing to 
an object, which switch housing (1) contains the switching 

mechanism (9, 14, 15, 26) and the electrical contacts (10, 11) 
and is provided with a cap (6), the switch housing (1) having 

a cylindrical region (2) and being arranged, prior to fixing, 
in a rotatable and longitudinally displaceable manner in a 

fixing part (3) that encloses the cylindrical region (2) at 
least partially, and being fixable in the fixing part (3), 

characterised in that the cylindrical region (2) is guided in 
a ring in an axially displaceable manner, the ring (3) being 

so mounted on a fixing plate (4) that it is rotatable about an 
axis (5) located radially with respect to the ring (3), and 

being provided with fixing means for the switch housing (1) 
and/or for securing the fixing plate (4) in position. 
Position switch according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the size of the inside diameter of the ring (3) in relation to 

the outside diameter of the cylindrical region (2) of the 
switch housing (1) is such that a frictional connection is 

produced between the ring (3) and the switch housing (1). 
Position switch according to either claim 1 or 
claim 2, characterised in that a ball-and-socket joint is 

provided for the purpose of the rotatable connection between 
the ring (3) and the fixing plate (4). 
Position switch according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the distance between the vertical centre 

of the ring (3) and the vertical centre of a fixing bore is 
such that a predetermined maximum distance is maintained 

between the vertical centre of the fixing bore and the end 
face at the connection end of the switch.  

 
Position switch according to any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that a free access region to the connections 

is arranged at the side of the switch housing (1) that is 
remote from a switch wheel (26), there being arranged in the 

switch housing (1) a connecting piece (17) that has a core 
(18) to which there are fixed connection plates (19) located 

longitudinally with respect to the centre line of the switch 
housing (1), which connection plates (19) have screw threads 

(20) located transversely to the centre line of the switch 
housing (1), into which screw threads (20) connecting screws 

(21) can be screwed, and in that the connecting piece (17) has 
on the side of the cap (6) a closing plate (22) in which 

openings (23) for the cable to pass through have been made in 
the region of the connecting screws (21), and in that the 

connection plates (19) are connected in an electrically 
conductive manner to switch contacts (11). 
Position switch according to any one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that a cap (6) that covers a free access 

region to the connections can be placed on the switch housing 
(1). 
Position switch according to claim 6, characterised in that 
a threaded connection (27) for the tight screwing of the 

connecting lines is provided on the end face of the cap (6), 
and/or a seal (25) is provided between the cap (6) and the 

switch housing (1). 
Position switch according to any one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the free access region to the 

connections is arranged on the side of the switch housing (1) 
facing the switch wheel (26), screwless clamping joints for 

the outer connection being provided in the connecting piece 
(17), which clamping joints are connected in an electrically 

conductive manner to the switch contacts (11).  
 
Position switch according to claim 8, characterised in that 
the screwless clamps can be released from outside by means of 

a push rod (42). 
Position switch according to any one of claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that a switch wheel (26) is so arranged in 

the switch housing (1) that it is rotatable about an axis (28) 

located transversely to the axial direction, and in that a 
contact bar (9) that operates the contacts (10; 11) is 

provided transversely to the longitudinal axis of the switch 
housing (1), the switch wheel (26) having a dog (29) that 

corresponds with a carrier projection (14) on the contact bar 
(9), in that the switch wheel (26) is provided at its 

periphery with a profile corresponding to the profile of an 
operating member (8) that is movable tangentially with respect 

to the switch wheel (26), and in that, in the tangential 
direction with respect to the switch wheel (26), an opening 

(23) is provided in the wall and in the end face of the switch 
housing (1) that is remote from the cap (6), through which 

openings (23) the operating member (8) can engage into the 
switch wheel (26). 
Position switch according to claim 10, characterised in 
that the switch wheel (26) is provided on its periphery with 

teeth (30) into which teeth (31) of the operating member (8) 
can engage, and in that there is provided a catch (32) that 

can be unlocked by the operating member (8) and that, in the 
locked condition, is arranged to prevent movement of the 

switch contacts 
(10; 11). 
Position switch according to any one of claims 5 to 11, 
characterised in that there is provided in the region of the 

teeth (30) a spring-loaded projecting catch (32) that can be 
pushed out of the region of the teeth (30) by the operating 

member (8) and that is provided with a locking projection  
 

(34), the path of movement of which, on rotation of the switch 
wheel (26), coincides with a locking rib (35) connected to the

region of the teeth (30). 
Position switch according to any one of claims 1 to 12, 
characterised in that fixing holes are provided in the 

operating member (8), which fixing holes are in the form of 
slots.
