<ABSTRACT>
A machine for banding copies of printed products has a stacking device, in which the copies can be stacked to form a stack (64) on a bottom (30) movable vertically up and down. Furthermore, there is provided a pressing device which can be brought above the formed stack (64) and on the underside (40) of which the upper end of the formed stack (64) can be pressed for the compression of the stack (64). Furthermore, a banding device for enclosing the stack (64) circumferentially by means of a band (49) is provided. In order to bring about a reduction in the overall height, whilst at the same time maintaining the continuous feed of the copies, it is proposed that a top side (42) of the pressing device (14) be designed as a further bottom, on which a part stack (68) of copies (66') is stacked during the pressing and banding operation, and that the part stack (68) be capable of being transferred from the pressing device on to the raisable and lowerable bottom (30).

A device for banding copies of printed matter, with 
a stacking apparatus (12) in which the copies (66) are stacked 

up into a stack (64) on a bottom (30) which can move vertically 
up and down; with a pressing apparatus (14) that can be brought 

over the stack (64) that has formed, and against whose underside 
(40) the top end of the stack (64) that has formed can be pressed 

in order to compress the stack (64), and with a banding apparatus 
(16) for peripherally enclosing the stack (64) with a band (49), 

characterized in that an upper side (42) of the pressing 
apparatus (14) is designed as a further bottom (44) for stacking 

copies (66') thereon to a partial stack (68) during the pressing 
and banding process, and in that the partial stack (68) can 

be transferred from the pressing apparatus (14) onto the bottom 
(30) which can be raised and lowered. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the bottom (30) which can be raised and lowered is configured 

so that it can be moved vertically into the pressing apparatus 
(14), and thereby lifts the partial stack (68) resting on the 

upper side (42) of the pressing apparatus (14), after which 
the pressing apparatus (14) can be brought out of the vertical 

movement shaft (26) of the bottom (30) which can be raised and 
lowered. 
Device according to claims 1 or 2, characterized in 

that the pressing apparatus (14) has pressing bars (38, 39) 
which can be moved laterally onto the stack (68), and in that 

the lowerable bottom (30) can be moved in vertically between 
the pressing bars (38, 39) in order to lift the partial stack 

(68).  
 
Device according to anyone of claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that welding dies (58, 60) of the banding apparatus 

(16) can be brought over the stack (68) in the same direction 
as the pressing apparatus (14). 
Device according to claim 4, characterized in that 
the welding dies (58, 60) are arranged between two outer lateral 

pressing bars (38, 39), and in that the structural height of 
the welding dies (58, 60) is such that they extend vertically 

between the upper side (42) and the underside (40) of the 
pressing apparatus (14). 
Device according to anyone of claims 1 to 5, characterized 
in that the upper side (42) of the pressing apparatus 

(14) is configured as a roller bottom, and in that the pressing 
apparatus (14) can be withdrawn laterally, such that the bottom 

(30) of the stacking apparatus (12) can be raised to approximately 
the same level as the roller bottom, and in that, when 

the pressing apparatus (14) is withdrawn laterally, the partial 
stack (68) that has formed thereon, can be held back and can 

be deposited on the bottom (30) of the stacking apparatus (12).
