<ABSTRACT>
A heatable milk vessel has a heating device (50) comprising at least one electrically heatable resistance element (52, 54) partially surrounding the vessel wall in a sheetlike manner, one or more measurement sensors (56) positioned in the vessel wall, and a control device (55) connected to said measurement sensors and intended for heating and keeping warm in a controlled manner the milk filled into the vessel (21). Expediently, two resistance elements (52, 54) controllable independently of one another are provided, one of which covers the bottom (21') of the vessel overall, while the other surrounds the lateral surface (21'') of the vessel over its entire height. The respective resistance element (52, 54) is regulated by the control device (55) in such a way that the vessel wall and thus the milk does not exceed an adjustable maximum temperature of between 70 and 75 Celsius during heating up and the heating output is reduced when a wall temperature of between 50 and 70 Celsius is reached. With this heating device (50) according to the invention, on the one hand the milk is heated and kept warm with less expenditure of energy on account of the direct heat transmission and, on the other hand, the heating temperature can be precisely controlled in a very simple way, with the result that overheating of the milk in every heating phase is strictly avoided.

Heatable milk container, with a heating device, which envelops the 
container and whose purpose is to heat the milk filled into said container 

or a milk mixture, wherein the heating device (50) exhibits at least one 
electrically heatable resistance element (52, 54), which partially envelops 

in a flat manner the container wall; one or several sensor(s) (56) 
positioned in the container walls; and a controller (55), which is connected 

to said sensors for controlled heating of the milk and keeping it warm,
 
characterized in that
 
the container (21) having a vessel (60), which is placed into said container 

an can be removed from said container, that the inner dimensions of the 
container (21) and the outer dimensions of the vessel are approximately 

the same; and, therefore, after placing the vessel (60) into the container 
(21), the entire outer circumference of the vessel (60) makes contact with 

said container, whereby a liquid medium, preferably water, can be filled 
into the gap (66) between the vessel (60) and the container (21). 
Heatable milk container as claimed in claim 1, wherein there are two 
resistance elements (52, 54), which can be driven independently of each 

other and of which the one covers the entire container bottom (21'), 
whereas the other envelops the container shell (21'') over its entire height.  

 
Heatable milk container as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the 
respective resistance element (52, 54) is controlled in such a manner by 

the controller (55), that the container wall and thus the milk, upon heating, 
does not exceed an adjustable maximum temperature ranging from 70째 to 

75째 Celsius; and upon reaching a wall temperature ranging from 50째 to 70째 
Celsius, the heating power is reduced. 
Heatable milk container as claimed in anyone of the preceding 
claims, wherein the container (21) is made of aluminium with a wall 

thickness ranging between 10 and 20 millimeters the resistance elements 
(52, 54), which are attached to the container walls, are made of silicone-coated 

glass fiber fabric and bifilar filament windings embedded in said 
glass fiber fabric. 
Heatable milk container as claimed in claim 4, wherein the 
aluminium container (21) is coated internally for the purpose of preventing 

the milk from baking on or sticking to said interior. 
Heatable milk container as claimed in anyone of the preceding 
claims, wherein the heating device (50) and the container (21) are 

integrated into one device (10); and wherein an exit (27') leads out of the 
container (21) in order to drain hot milk; and a separate pipe (26), which 

leads to a pump (22) and an outlet (36), leads out of the said container; 
and wherein, moreover, an air mixture is fed into said pipe, with the result 

that milk foam for cappuccino coffee can be produced.  
 
Heatable milk container as claimed in claim 1, wherein the vessel 
(60) can be closed with a two-part cover, whose cover halves (62) are 

arranged side-by-side and are pivotally mounted on the side of the vessel 
(60), except in the closed position, in which they can be removed from the 

vessel (60) approximately vertically. 
Heatable milk container as claimed in claim 7, wherein each of the 
two cover halves (62) is mounted on a hinge (64) attached to the side of 

the vessel (60), whereby this hinge (64) exhibits a bracket (65), which is 
attached to the vessel (60), with a recess (68) and an external rounding 

(69), a bolt (67), which can be centred in the recess (68) and is arranged in 
the respective cover half (62), and a flap-shaped edge (61), which is 

formed by the cover half (62) and which envelops the rounding (69) of the 
bracket (65) such as when the cover half is opened, the respective cover 

half (62) is connected to the vessel (60) in a shape-locking manner.
