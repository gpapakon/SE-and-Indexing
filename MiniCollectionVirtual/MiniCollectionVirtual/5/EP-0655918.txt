<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to methods of treating cancer in a mammal which comprise administering to said mammal a potentiating effective amount of AZT, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester thereof, with an effective amount of either an alkylating agent or a DNA intercalating agent. The preferred alkylating agent is melphalan while the preferred DNA intercalating agent is adriamycin.

<DESCRIPTION>
 TREATMENT OF CANCER WITH AZT AND ALKYLATING OR INTERCALATING AGENTSThis invention relates to the field of cancer therapy and particularly to chemotherapeutic methods of treating cancer as well as to pharmaceutical compositions for use in such methods.Chemotherapy is an important method of treating cancer which comprises the administration of substances, which are usually to a greater or lesser degree cytotoxic, to a patient. Because of the nature of these compounds patients often suffer from side effects which can in many cases be quite severe.Drugs 39(4) (1990) p 489 is a review of certain well known categories of anti-cancer agents.3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (also known as A T or zidovudine) has been found to have a particularly beneficial clinical effect against a wide range of conditions associated with HTV infections such as Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), ALDS- related complex (ARC) and asymptomatic infections. This compound at low doses is generally very well tolerated by patients and is now widely used in the treatment of HTV infections.In addition, however, AZT has been found to be useful in combination with certain known anti-cancer agents in the treatment of cancer.US patent No. 5116823 discloses the use of AZT in combination with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), its precursor 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (FTJDR) or methotrexate in the treatment of carcinomas, particularly of the colon.It has now been found that the action of alkylating agents or of DNA intercalating agents as anti-cancer agents is potentiated by using AZT in combination with them. This potentiation results in a surprisingly large synergistic cytotoxic effect. Thus, treatment with the combination is more effective than treatment with either compound alone.Therefore in a first embodiment the invention provides a method of treating cancer in a mammal such as a human which comprises administering to said mammal a potentiating effective amount of AZT, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester thereof, and an effective amount of an alkylating agent. 

Examples of such alkylating agents are chloromethine, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, melphalan and chlorambucil, with melphalan being preferred.Preferably the two agents should be administered separately, such separate administration being carried out within a time period sufficient to allow the desired therapeutic effect to take place.More preferably the administration of the AZT precedes administration of the alkylating agent.Most preferably AZT is administered both before and

CLAIMS
1. A method of treating cancer in a mammal which comprises administering to said mammal a potentiating effective amount of AZT, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester thereof, and an effective amount of an alkylating agent.
2. A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the AZT, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester thereof, is administered prior to administration of said alkylating agent.
3. A method as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the AZT, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester thereof, is administered as a plurality of separate doses.
4. A method as claimed in claim 3 wherein a further dose of AZT is administered together with the alkylating agent.
5. A method as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4 wherein after administration of the alkylating agent a further dose of AZT is administered.
6. A method as claimed in anyone of claims 1 to 5 wherein said alkylating agent is melphalan.
7. A method as claimed in claim 6 wherein the AZT, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester thereof, and/or said alkylating agent are administered by bolus or infusion.
8. A method of treating cancer in a mammal which comprises administering to said mammal a potentiating effective amount of AZT, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester therof, and an effective amount of a DNA intercalating agent.
9. A method as claimed in claim 8 wherein the AZT, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester thereof is administered prior to administration of said DNA intercalating agent.
10. A method as claimed in claim 9 wherein after administration of said DNA intercalating agent a second dose of AZT is administered to the mammal. 


11. A method as claimed in any one claims 8 to 10 wherein said DNA intercalating agent is adriamycin.
12. A method as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 11 wherein said mammal is a human.
13. A pack consisting essentially of AZT, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester thereof, and an alkylating agent, provided separately therein and presented for co-administration to a mammal, for the treatment of cancer.
14. A pack consisting essentially of AZT, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester thereof, and a DNA intercalating agent, provided separately therein and presented for co-administration to a mammal, for the treatment of cancer.
15. A pack as claimed in claim 13 or claim 14 wherein said mammal is man.
16. A pack as claimed in claim 13 wherein said alkylating agent is melphalan.
17. AZT for use in the potentiation of the anticancer activity of an alkylating agent or DNA intercalating agent.
18. The use of AZT in the manufacture of a medicament for the potentiation of the anticancer activity of an alkylating agent or DNA intercalating agent.
