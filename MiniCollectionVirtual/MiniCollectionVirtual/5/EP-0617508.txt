<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the field of differential
amplifiers and operational amplifiers and more particularly to an amplifier of this kind
fabricated in integrated circuit technology and having a rail-to-rail common mode range
at the amplifier input and output.There are times when an operational amplifier is required which can
linearly amplify an input signal over nearly the full supply voltage range, especially in
the case of a supply voltage as low as 1.5 volts. Operational amplifiers to be used with
low supply voltages should utilize as much as possible of the available supply voltage
range in order to obtain the best signal-to-noise ratio. This requirement is especially
severe in the case of low power applications or when the supply voltage is low as in
battery powered systems.U.S. Patent 4,555,673 issued 11/26/85 in the name of J.H. Huijsing et al
and an article by J.H. Huijsing et al in the IEEE JSSC, vol. SC-20, No. 6, 12/85,
entitled "Low Voltage Operational Amplifier with Rail-to-Rail Input and Output
Ranges", describe circuits which generally work well to amplify an input signal while
using a large part of the supply voltage range. The Huijsing et al article describes an
operational amplifier having rail-to-rail input, a so-called folded cascode stage and a
rail-to-rail class A-B output stage. The input stage with a rail-to-rail common-mode
input voltage range provides a constant transconductance over the full common-mode
range. However, this operational amplifier also requires an intermediate stage to
increase the gain and a completely separate class A-B quiescent bias network. Another
disadvantage of the Huijsing et al operational amplifier is that it requires a fairly large
number of integrated circuit components.In the Huijsing et al patent and article the rail-to-rail common-mode
voltage swing at the amplifier input is obtained by using two differential amplifier input
stages in parallel and operating same such that the common-mode (CM) voltage of one
stage can reach the positive supply voltage rail and that of the other the negative supply 
voltage rail. Three common-mode input voltage ranges are present in these circuits. In a
first range, which extends from the negative supply voltage to an intermediate range,
only one differential amplifier input stage is operative. In a second range extending
from the positive supply voltage to the intermediate range, the other differential
amplifier input stage is operative. In the intermediate range, both differential amplifier
