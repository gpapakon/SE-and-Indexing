<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns improvements in, and 
relating to, polyester fine filaments and their 
manufacture and use. Historically, synthetic fibers for use in 
apparel, including polyester fibers, have generally 
been supplied to the textile industry for use in 
fabrics and garments with the object of more or less 
duplicating and/or improving on natural fibers. For 
many years, commercial synthetic textile filaments, 
such as were made and used for apparel, were mostly of 
deniers per filament (dpf) in a similar range to those 
of the commoner natural fibers; i.e., cotton and wool. 
More recently, however, polyester filaments have been 
available commercially in a range of dpf similar to 
that of natural silk, i.e. of the order of 1 dpf, and 
even in subdeniers, i.e., less than about 1 dpf, 
despite the increased cost. Various reasons have been 
given for the recent commercial interest in such lower 
dpfs, such as about 1 dpf, or even subdeniers. Much has been written recently about this 
increasing interest in fine denier polyester filaments. 
Very little technical detail has, however, been 
published about any difficulties in spinning (i.e., 
extrusion and winding) techniques that have been used, 
or even would be desirable, for manufacturing such fine 
filaments, although it has been well understood by 
those skilled in the art that conventional preparation 
and handling techniques could not be used for such fine 
filaments. For instance, in Textile Month, June 1990, 
pages 40-46, three approaches are discussed for making 
microfibers; namely, 1) conventional spinning to fine  
 
deniers, 2) splitting bicomponent fibers (of higher 
deniers), and 3) dissolving away a component from 
bicomponent fibers of higher denier. It will be 
understood that the 2nd and 3rd approaches involve 
bicomponent spinning to form filaments first of higher 
denier, and processing such spun higher denier 
filaments to obtain the filaments of reduced denier; 
such processing techniques are not the subject of the 
present invention. The present invention is concerned with the 
preparation of fine filaments by a novel direct 
spinning/winding process, in contrast with a process of 
first spinning and winding up bicomponent filaments of 
higher denier which then must be further processed to 
obtain the reduced fine denier filaments that are 
desired for use in textiles. Another 2-stage 
possibility of manufacturing filaments of reduced 
denier is to spin filaments of greater than one denier, 
and then, draw the filaments after
