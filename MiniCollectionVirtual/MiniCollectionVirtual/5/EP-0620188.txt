<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing α-alumina powder comprises 
calcining transition alumina and/or a transition alumina 

precursor which transforms to transition alumina on heating, 
in a gas atmosphere containing (1) a hydrogen halide, (2) 

a component prepared from a halogen and steam or (3) a 
halogen, and in the presence of seed crystals and/or a 

shape-controlling agent. The product α-alumina powder 
comprises particles of a substantially octahedral or eicosa-hedral 

shape, a pre-determined structure, and a narrow 
primary particle size distribution; the powder is particularly 

useful as a raw material for preparing abrasives, 
fillers, sinters or spacers.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to
a process for producing
α-alumina powder having
excellent characteristics and to a process for its production.α-Alumina powder is widely used as a raw material for
abrasives, sinters, plasma spraying materials, fillers, etc.
α-Alumina powder obtained by conventional processes that have
been generally employed comprises irregular-shaped
polycrystals, contains many agglomerated particles, and has
broad particle size distribution. The purity of such
conventional α-alumina products is insufficient for some
uses. In order to avoid these disadvantages and, for some
specific uses, to control primary particle size or shape,
α-alumina powder produced by special processes as hereinafter
described has been employed. However, these special
processes still involve difficulty in producing α-alumina
powder with a narrow primary particle size distribution,
which comprises α-alumina particles having a controlled
shape, a controlled primary size, and homogeneity. Further,
in order to orientate α-alumina particles in a specific
direction when packed or laminated in layer(s), it is
desirable that the powder comprises α-alumina particles
having a rod-like shape, a cocoon shape or a thick plate 
shape. However, conventionally-obtained α-alumina powder has
broad primary particle size distribution or the particles
thereof have a thin plate shape, and it has hitherto been
difficult to obtain α-alumina powder having a narrow primary
particle size distribution and with the particles thereof
having a shape suitable for orientation.Among general processes for producing α-alumina
powder a Bayer's process is the most economical process. In
a Bayer's process, bauxite is converted to aluminum
hydroxide or transition alumina, which is then calcined in
air to prepare α-alumina powder.The aluminum hydroxide or transition alumina which is
obtained as an intermediate product on an industrial scale at
low cost comprises agglomerated particles having a diameter
of greater than 10 µm. α-Alumina powder obtained by
calcination of such aluminum hydroxide or transition alumina
in air comprises primary particles of irregular shape
containing many strongly agglomerated coarse particles.
The α-alumina powder containing coarse agglomerated particles
is ground into a final product by means of a ball mill, a
vibration mill, etc., but grinding is not always easy and
increases the cost. Further, α-alumina powder having poor
grindability needs a long grinding time; consequently too
fine a powder may be formed.Several proposals
