<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides a high-speed FET with a 
sufficiently high output current, and an FET having a high 

mobility of channel electrons and a high electron 
saturation rate. For this purpose, in this invention, a 

buffer layer (2), a first channel layer (3), a first spacer 
layer (4), a second channel layer (5), a second spacer 

layer (6), a third channel layer (7), and a capping layer 
(8) are sequentially epitaxially grown on a semi-insulating 

GaAs semiconductor substrate (1). Drain and source regions 
(9, 10) are formed, and a gate electrode (11) is formed to 

Schottky-contact the capping layer (8). Drain and source 
electrodes (12, 13) are formed to ohmic-contact the drain 

and source regions (9, 10). Extension of a surface 
depletion layer from the substrate surface to a deep 

portion is prevented by the third channel layer (7) closest 
to the substrate surface. For this reason, a sufficient 

quantity of electrons for forming a current channel are 
assured by the second and first channel layers (3, 5).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the structure of a 
field effect transistor (FET) which can realize an ultra 
high-speed operation, and a method of manufacturing the 
same. Conventionally, as an FET which can realize an ultra 
high-speed operation, an FET in which an active layer for 
forming a current channel adopts a so-called pulse-doped 
structure is known. In the FET with the pulse-doped 
structure, the impurity profile of the active layer 
reveals an undoped state from the substrate surface to a 
predetermined depth. However, the impurity concentration 
changes in a pulse-like pattern or stepwise to a high 
concentration at the predetermined depth from the 
substrate surface, and the impurity profile returns to an 
undoped state at a deeper substrate position. Such an FET 
with the pulse-doped structure is described in, e.g., 
U.S. Patent No. 4,163,984 or in p. 759 of the following 
reference:
 
   1986 IEEE IEDM "A 760 mS/mm N+SELF-ALIGNED 
ENHANCEMENT MODE DOPED-CHANNEL MIS-LIKE FET(DMT)"
 
 
   However, in such an FET with the pulse-doped 
structure, a sufficient quantity of electrons for forming 
a current channel cannot be assured. For this reason, 
another patent application (Japanese Patent Laid-Open 
No. 4-245646) by the present applicant proposed an FET 
having a pulse-doped structure in which two active layers 
are formed. With this FET, since the two active layers 
are formed, the quantity of electrons for forming a 
current channel increases, and a high current output can 
be realized. However, in the conventional FET with the structure 
including two active layers, when a long gate effect 
occurs due to a surface depletion layer in the drain 
electrode side, the effective gate length increases, and 
the active layer formed on the surface side of the 
substrate is depleted. When the active layer is 
depleted, the flow of channel electrons is hindered, and 
the total quantity of electrons for forming a current 
channel decreases. As a result, a high current output 
cannot often be obtained in the conventional FET with the 
above-mentioned structure. In the conventional FET with the pulse-doped 
structure described in the above-mentioned U.S. Patent, 
electrons for forming a channel move in an active layer 
with a high impurity concentration in a low electric 
field region. For this reason, electrons are  
 
considerably influenced by impurity scattering, and the 
electron mobility in a low electric field region is 
lowered. As a result, the high-frequency operation 
characteristics of
