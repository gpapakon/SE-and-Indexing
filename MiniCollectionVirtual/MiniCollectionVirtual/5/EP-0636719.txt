<ABSTRACT>
Device for the false twisting of synthetic yarn in an S-twist and a Z-twist, with friction discs driven by a warve and with a pressure roller cooperating therewith, there being provided a spring which is supported on one side on the machine frame and on the other side on the device and which presses the warve against a drive belt, the possibility of tensioning the force of the spring, in addition to its effect, being afforded additionally in order to compensate force displacements occurring under particular working conditions.

<CLAIMS>
Device (10) for false twisting of a synthetic yarn in a 
texturing machine with three or four parallel shafts (18, 

20, 22) which are mounted on a holding device (30) at the 
corners of an equilateral polygon and are rotatably driven 

in the same direction by a wharve (24), and are each 
immovably arranged on a plurality of friction discs (16) 

and overlap over the mid-point of the polygon, the wharve 
being able to engage one or other side of a driving belt 

(36) rotating in a predetermined direction in order to 
impart as desired twist in the S-direction or Z-direction 

depending on the twist direction, characterised in that 

a) the holding device (30) is displaceably mounted relative 
to the machine frame (26); 
b) a compression spring (46) supported on the one hand on 
the machine frame (26) and on the other hand on the holding 

device (30) is provided to force the wharve (24) against 
the driving belt (36); 
c) an adjustable connection (66) is provided between the 
holding device (30) and compres
sion spring (46) in order to 
change the spring force as desired. 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
holding device (30) is a carriage slidably mounted on a 

bracket (28) projecting from the machine frame (26). 
Device according to claim 2, characterised in that the 
carriage (30) comprises two plates (48, 50) mutually 

adjustable in the direction of the bracket (28), one of 
which plates (12a, 48) carries the spindles (18, 20, 22) 

and the other plate (50) is borne by the bracket (28). 
Device according to claim 3, characterised in that the 
carriage (30) is connected to the bracket (28) via two 

spaced-apart shoulders (52, 54) and that alternately 
engageable devices (38, 38a, 40, 40a) for supporting the 

compression spring (46) are provided on the bracket (28) 
for cooperating with one of the shoulders (52, 54).  

 
Device according to claim 4, characterised in that 
devices are provided on the free end of the bracket (28) 

for clamping the compression spring (46) between a shoulder 
(52, 54) and the respectively engaged supporting device 

(38, 38a, 40, 40a). 
Device according to claim 5, characterized in that the devices for clamping the 
compression spring (64) are alternately engageable connecting link guides (60, 

62) having cam curves opposing the spring force and being associated to the 
supporting devices (38, 38a; 40, 40). 
Device according to claim 6, characterised in that the 
connecting link guides (60, 62) are activated by a pin (44) 

that can be adjusted transversely relative to the bracket 
(28). 
Device according to claim 7, characterised in that the 
connection for adjusting the spring force is a shoulder 

(66) rigidly connected on the one hand to the plate (48) 
carrying the spindles (18, 20, 22) and on the other hand to 

the compression spring (46) in its middle.
