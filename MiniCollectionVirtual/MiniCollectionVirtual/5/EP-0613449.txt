<ABSTRACT>
A low temperature method for synthesizing micrograin tungsten carbide particles having an average diameter of 0.05 to 0.2  mu m includes the programmed heating of tungsten trioxide powder or other material containing tungsten in a flowing molecular hydrogen atmosphere having a constant proportion of molecular methane. The heating program is carried out at two different heating rates, the first being higher than the second. The first heating rate is 5  DEG C to 50  DEG C per minute from 25  DEG C to 535  DEG C. The second heating rate is 1 DEG C to 10  DEG C per minute from 535  DEG C to about 850  DEG C. The last temperature is then held until conversion of the tungsten trioxide or other tungsten-containing material to tungsten carbide is complete, typically from about 15 minutes to 3 hours.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a method of 
converting a tungsten-containing material, tungsten 
trioxide (WO₃), to tungsten carbide (WC) without first 
reducing all of the WO₃ to tungsten as a separate 
intermediate. Tungsten carbide, a ceramic material having good 
chemical stability and corrosion resistance, has been 
called the strongest of all structural materials. It has 
high hardness, wear resistance and temperature resistance. 
Tungsten carbide powders are converted by conventional 
processes to form cemented carbides, dies and cutting 
tools, wear resistant parts, cermets and electrical 
resistors. They are also used as abrasives in liquids. 
Cemented tungsten carbides are mixtures of 80 to 95 percent 
by weight WC and 5 to 20 percent by weight cobalt or other 
ductile metal as a binder phase. Cemented tungsten 
carbides are useful for forming tools and as abrasives for 
machining and grinding metals, rock, molded products, 
porcelain and glass. They are also useful in forming 
gauges, blast nozzles, knives and drill bits. The properties ultimately possessed by an article 
formed from WC powder depend, to a great extent, upon WC 
grain size and process conditions used to form the article. 
Certain tungsten carbides of fine grain or particle sizes 
(known as micrograin tungsten carbides) from 0.05 to 0.2 
micrometers in diameter are especially useful for certain 
purposes, such as end milling and circuit board drilling 
applications. The particle size range suggests that 
micrograin tungsten carbides may also be useful in 
catalytic processes.  
 Micrograin particulate materials preferably have a 
controlled morphology, a narrow size distribution, a well-defined 
stoichiometry and relatively high purity. 
Micrograin WC is not readily prepared from larger WC 
particles. The hardness for which WC is valued also 
impairs or prevents the mechanical reduction of large WC 
particles to a smaller size by conventional methods such as 
grinding or milling. Accordingly, it would be very 
desirable to directly manufacture micrograin WC particles. Some metal carbides can be produced by the 
carbothermal reduction of a metal oxide with solid carbon 
under a reducing atmosphere. Hydrogen is a conventional 
reducing gas. Conventional teachings do not, however, 
advocate the direct carbothermal reduction of WO₃ (or 
another solid, tungsten-containing material) with carbon in 
a molecular hydrogen atmosphere. For example, Funtai Oyobi

A method for forming a fine grained tungsten 
carbide that has a particle size within a range of from 

0.05 to 0.2 µm in diameter, which comprises heating a 
solid, tungsten-containing material in a flowing atmosphere 

containing molecular hydrogen and a molecular carbonaceous 
water-consuming gas in a fixed ratio, on a molar, gas 

volume or gas partial pressure basis, for a time sufficient 
to convert substantially all of said material to tungsten 

carbide, wherein said heating is carried out at a first 
heating rate of 5 to 50°C per minute from 25°C to 535°C, 

and at a second heating rate, lower than the first heating 
rate, of 1 to 10°C per minute from 535°C to a final 

temperature of 800°C to 855°C, and thereafter held at about 
said final temperature for 15 minutes to 3 hours.

final temperature is 840°C to 855°C. 
A method as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2, 
wherein said carbonaceous water-consuming gas is selected
