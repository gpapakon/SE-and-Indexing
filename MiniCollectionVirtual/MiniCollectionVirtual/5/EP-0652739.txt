<DESCRIPTION>
 AN INSTANTANEOUSLY SELF-FOAMING LIQUID CLEANSING COMPOSITION AND DISPENSER THEREFORThe present invention relates to a novel self-foaming aqueous liquid cleansing composition. More particuiariy, the present invention relates to a liquid cleansing composition which is packagable in a non-pressurized dispenser made of barrier material, which is squeezable and equipped with a positive shut-off valve.Conventional personal care and household cleaning products are available either as solids or as liquids. Solid cleaning products include bar soap, which can be whipped up into a o lather by agitation with hands, or a brush in the case of a shaving soap; or powders which are normally first dissolved in water and then agitated to prepare a lather. Barsoaps and powders may cause unsightly residues on sinks, bath tubs and showers if exposed to water. This also results in waste of products.Liquid cleaning products are generally available as thick liquids, such as 5 shampoos, shower gels, or liquid soaps, which are difficult to foam and take time, dexterity, and special manipulation to dispense from their containers and to foam and lather.The use of aqueous post foaming compositions in the form of a gel in personal care products such as shaving creams, toothpaste, and shower gels has been known in the art for several years. However, these products are generally packaged in rigid pressurized aerosol 0 containers such asthe SEP O™ (Trademark of Continental Can Company, U.S.A., Inc.) can or piston cans with propellant gases contained therein. Such aerosol containers are expensive to manufacture and ship. The propellents used therein do notform an integral part of the composition and are typically compartmentalized from the product to provide the positive pressure needed to aid in the dispensation of the product. Such containers are known in the 5 industry as barrier packages because they provide the barrier between the extraneous propellants and the composition to be dispensed. The propellant gases released to the atmosphere by use of such containers are increasingly unacceptable environmentally. The aerosol containers for dispensing post foaming gels typically contain these products under pressures ranging from 308 kPa to 420 kPa (44 psig to 60 psig) above the atmospheric pressure 0 at ambient temperatures, and dispense about less than four gram/sec of the product at a given time.Some personal care products like shaving lathers, and mousses are characteristically dispensed as foams and are contained in the pressurized
