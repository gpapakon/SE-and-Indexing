<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to new chemical compounds which have value in the field 
of medical science. More particularly, it relates to new chemical compounds which are 
of value for administration to a mammalian subject, particularly man, as 
immunosuppressive agents. These new immunosuppressive agents can be compared 
to the macrolides known as FK-506 and FK-520, which are described in further detail 
in United States Patent No. 4,894,366. The new compounds of this invention will find 
special utility in preventing or treating graft rejection following skin or organ transplant 
surgery and in preventing or treating autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis 
and psoriasis. Additionally, these macrolide derivatives will find use in preventing or 
treating infectious diseases caused by fungi. Graft or organ transplant rejection following transplant surgery is a common 
occurrence which arises when foreign antigens are recognized by the host's immune 
response system. The host's immune response system, in an effort to "protect" itself 
from the foreign tissue, then releases its cellular and humoral arsenal. The antibodies 
attack the foreign tissue, resulting in complications which often end in rejection of said 
tissue. Similarly, the occurrence of immunoregulatory irregularities in autoimmune and 
chronic inflammatory diseases is well known. Irrespective of the underlying etiology of 
the condition, a variety of autoantibodies and self-reactive lymphocytes often arise to 
complicate the condition. Treatments which target the immune response system often result in a complete 
shutdown of the system, leading to a lowering of the body's ability to combat infection. 
This can be as dangerous as the original condition which led to the shutdown. Currently the leading medicinal agent for the prevention or treatment of graft 
rejection is cyclosporin A, approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration 
in 1983. The drug acts by inhibiting the body's immune response system from 
mobilizing its arsenal of natural protecting agents to reject the transplant's foreign 
protein. Although cyclosporin is effective in fighting graft rejection, it suffers drawbacks 
in that it can cause kidney failure, liver damage and ulcers; which in many cases can 
be very severe. Safer drugs which are more selective in their ability to affect the  
 
immune response system and which have fewer side effects are constantly being 
pursued. United States Patent No. 4,894,366 discloses the macrolides FK-506 and FK-520,
