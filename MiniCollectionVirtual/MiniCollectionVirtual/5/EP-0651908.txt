A device for storing and transporting substantially 
round, disk-shaped, objects (1) of like dimension, in 

particular a compact disk data carrier, with at least one 
magazine (2, 3) and with at least one drivable turning 

element (4, 5, 6; 7, 8, 9), which acts as a conveying 
device, is mounted so as to rotate about its central axis 

and is arranged and dimensioned in such a manner that 
disk-shaped objects (1) can be arranged at least with a 

peripheral section upon said turning element, 
characterised in that the turning element (4, 5, 6; 7, 8, 

9) comprises a sequence of moving sections of the same 
shape, a disk-shaped object (1) can be arranged at least 

with a peripheral section in the moving sections of the 
turning element (4, 5, 6; 7, 8, 9), and the height of the 

sections of the turning element (4, 5, 6; 7, 8, 9) is 
dimensioned to correspond to the thickness of the disk-shaped 

objects (1), so that the turning element (4, 5, 6; 
7, 8, 9) acts as a holder for the disk-shaped objects 

(1). 
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the drive and rotating device and/or the rotational 

velocity of the turning element (4, 5, 6; 7, 8, 9) is 
selectable and variable. 
A device according to one of claims 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the turning element (4, 5, 6; 7, 8, 

9) is formed by a spiral or a worm. 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the magazine (2, 3) comprises a 

plurality of turning elements (4, 5, 6; 7, 8, 9), which 
act upon the edge regions of the disk-shaped objects, 

distributed about the circumference thereof, and the 
rotational movement of the turning elements (4, 5, 6; 7, 

8, 9) is coupled.  
 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that at least one manipulator (M1, M2) 

is provided, which has access to the disk-shaped object 
(1) arranged in an end position of the magazine (2, 3) 

and the manipulator (M1, M2) is arranged and constructed 
in such a manner that the disk-shaped objects (1) can be 

removed from the magazine (2, 3) with the aid of the 
manipulator (M1, M2) and transferred to a further device 

(P1, P2), and the disk-shaped objects (1) can be 
positioned in the magazine (2, 3) with the aid of the 

manipulator (M1, M2). 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that an arrangement of at least two 

parallelly aligned magazines (2, 3) of substantially 
equal length is provided, each of the magazines (2, 3) 

comprises at least one turning element (4, 5, 6; 7, 8, 9) 
extending over the entire length of the magazine, at 

least one manipulator (M1, M2) is provided at both ends 
of the magazine arrangement, with selective access to one 

of the disk-shaped objects (1) arranged in the respective 
end position of one of the magazines (2, 3) of the 

magazine arrangement, and the rotational movements of the 
turning elements (4, 5, 6; 7, 8, 9) of the magazines (2, 

3) of the magazine arrangement are coupled. 
A device according to claim 9 or 10, characterised 
in that at least one of the manipulators acts as a 

transfer manipulator (M2) by selectively removing disk-shaped 
objects (1) from one of the at least two magazines 

(2, 3) and positioning said objects in the respective 
other magazine (2, 3), and the movements of the transfer 

manipulator (M2) are coupled with the rotational 
movements of the turning elements (4, 5, 6; 7, 8, 9) of 

the magazines (2, 3) of the magazine arrangement. 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that means are provided for controlling 

and/or programming the rotational movements of the  
 

turning elements (4, 5, 6; 7, 8, 9) of the magazines 
and/or the movements of the manipulators (M1, M2) and/or 

of the devices (P1, P2). 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 8, said 
device being used for storing and transporting disk-shaped 

objects (1) comprising a through opening (12), 
characterised in that the manipulator (M1, M2) comprises 

at least one rod-like clamping device (13), which can be 
selectively actuated, engages in the through opening (12) 

of a disk-shaped object (1) and in its actuated state 
exerts a clamping effect upon the edge region of the 

through opening (12). 
A device according to one of claims 7 to 9, 
characterised in that the transfer manipulator (M1, M2) 

comprises at least two rod-like clamping devices (13), 
which are arranged offset and are movable relative to one 

another, for a disk-shaped object (1) in each case, and 
the rod-like clamping device (13) comprises a conical rod 

(14) and an arrangement enclosing said rod of at least 
two leaf springs (15) having hooked end regions, the 

conical rod (13) being displaceable relative to the leaf 
spring arrangement.
