<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a catalyst for the epoxidation of alkenes using alkylhydroperoxide, the catalyst comprising an ion of one or more of the metals molybdenum, wolfram, titanium or vanadium on an inorganic carrier, characterised in that the metal ion is bound to the carrier via a polydentate organic ligand. The invention also relates to a process for the preparation of an alkene oxide by an alkene having 3 or more carbon atoms with an alkylhydroperoxide, using the catalyst described above.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a catalyst for the 
epoxidation of alkenes using alkylhydroperoxide, the 
catalyst comprising an ion of one or more of the metals 
molybdenum, tungsten, titanium or vanadium on a solid 
inorganic carrier. Processes are known and practiced commercially 
for the epoxidation of olefins by catalytic reaction of 
alkenes with an alkylhydroperoxide. EP-A-193682, for 
instance, describes the use of molybdenum in a homogeneous 
catalysed reaction. Efforts have been made by prior workers to 
develop heterogeneous catalyst systems useful in such 
epoxidations which are essentially insoluble in the 
reaction mixture. EP-A-421781 describes a molybdenum oxide 
on a solid silica carrier. Such a catalyst presents the 
drawback that the yield of the epoxidation reaction 
decreases if the same catalyst is used several times in 
succession. Furthermore, catalysts of this type are 
calcined. Calcination often causes sintering of the 
surface, which makes such a catalyst less readily 
regenerable. Furthermore, catalyst is lost in 
regeneration. The invention provides a solution to these 
problems by providing a catalyst with which the metal 
(ion) is bound to the inorganic carrier via a polydentate 
organic ligand. The catalyst according to the invention appears 
to combine a very high activity with a high selectivity in 
comparison with the catalyst described in EP-A-421781, and 
to be very stable as well. The solid carrier is preferably an oxide of 
silicon, aluminium, titanium, or mixtures hereof; silicon 
oxide in particular is preferred because it is available 
in many types.  
 According to the invention the inorganic carrier 
has polydentate organic ligands, to which a suitable metal 
ion is coordinated. An ion chosen from the group of metals 
comprising molybdenum, tungsten, titanium or vanadium is 
chosen as the metal ion. Preferably use is made of 
molybdenum. The polydentate ligand is preferably bi-, tri- or 
tetradentate. With particular preference use is made of 
di- or tridentate ligands. Higher-dentate ligands may 
shield the metal ion, which could make it less active. The ligand preferably has oxygen, nitrogen or 
sulphur atoms as coordinating atoms for the metal ion. 
With more preference oxygen and/or nitrogen atoms are 
chosen. With particular preference the polydentate ligand 
has at least one coordinating nitrogen atom. The 
coordinating ligands are preferably in the form of an 
alcohol group, a ketone group, an aldehyde group, an ether 
group, a carboxyl group, a primary,
