<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a condom. As it is well known in the art, condoms, among 
the means having a contraceptive function, have a 
remarkable importance since they are a protective 
barrier against the infections caused by viruses. Condoms, as known, even guaranteeing a good 
impermeability and safety, show remarkable 
problems. In fact, authoritative studies which have been 
done recently in the medical field, allowed to 
ascertain that the latex membrane of which conventional 
condoms are made, show porosities through 
which viruses, such as the HIV virus which is responsive 
of the AIDS infection, are able to pass 
easily, thus causing very dangerous infections. Further, the very high influence of the membrane 
breakings which very frequently occur during 
the use of said condoms is known. The aim of present invention is to solve the 
above said problems and drawbacks, making a condom 
which is able to offer an effective and suitable  
 
barrier against virus infections and which shows a 
very high contraceptive activity.
 
   Another purpose of the present invention 
is to make a condom which is able to eliminate the 
troublesome irritations which may occur on skin 
using the conventional condoms during sexual intercourses. These aims are achieved by a condom 
characterized in that it comprises two membranes, 
an external and an internal one, between which it 
is inserted at least one substance which is able to 
guarantee the maximum contraceptive safety, even if 
one of said membranes should break. Besides, the condom of the present invention 
due to its feasible characteristic peculiarities, 
gives a high guaranty as to tolerability and safety 
and it is easily obtainable using elements and 
materials which are commonly available. Therefore, such a condom is advantageous from 
the economical point of view too. The aims and the purposes hereabove exposed, 
which will be better understood in the following 
disclosure, are obtained by a condom, according to 
the present invention, characterised in that it 
comprises two membranes, one internal and one external,  
 
between which at least one substance, such 
as, for instance, a lubricating, an antiseptic, 
virucidal and/or a contraceptive agent or a mixture 
thereof, is present. Further peculiarities and advantages of the 
present invention will be better understood by an 
analysis of the description of a preferred, non 
limiting embodiment of the condom of the present 
invention, which is illustrative but non limitative 
of the present
