<ABSTRACT>
A wall element according to the invention is characterised by a system of posts (14) which are arranged symmetrically with respect to a longitudinal centre plane (7), widened cross-sectionally in the direction of the outer sides (5, 5') and between which there extend panels (8) - which are retained in a positively locking manner by the arrangement of the posts. The posts, which are made from concrete, are connected to one another via screw-connections and a gap (9) located between the panels (8), which are made from a foamed geopolymer material, is filled with an expanding polyurethane material. For the architectural design of the outer side of the wall element, but also for the further improvement of the heat insulation, the sides (12), of the posts (14), which are laid in the outer sides of the wall element may be covered by panels (18) which are arched or profiled in some other manner and, in turn, consist of a foamed geopolymer material. This thus results in a wall element which is, to the greatest extent, homogeneous in terms of materials, can be varied within wide limits in terms of design, is suitable for fulfilling numerous structural functions and can be used very flexibly on site or by the user.

Wall element for use in the construction of high-rise buildings, comprising an 
extensive, framework-like arrangement of stays (1, 14), transverse beams or 

the like which are intended and designed to carry loads and consist of an 
inorganic material, 


wherein plates (8) which are connected to the stays (1, 14) and/or the 
transverse beams and which consist of an inorganic foam material are 

inserted into the spaces existing in the arrangement, 
wherein the stays (1, 14) - as seen in the cross-sectional view-comprise 
chamfered surfaces (3) which extend at an angle to the 

datum plane of the wall element and form at least one part of the 
surfaces intended to be connected to the adjacent plates (8), 
 
characterised in that, 


the chamfered surfaces (3) - as seen in the cross-sectional view of a 
stay - are of a form which is planar, cylindrical or curved in any other 

manner, 
the width dimension of the cross-section of a stay (1, 14) - as seen 
along a central plane (4) which extends perpendicular to the datum 

plane of the wall element - increases in size starting from a narrow or 
base side (6) over the chamfered surfaces (3) - and where 

appropriate over the intermediate portions - as far as a broad side 
(12). 
Wall element according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that, 


the plates (8) consist of a geopolymer foam material. 
Wall element according to claim 1 or 2,
 
characterised in that, 


the stays (1, 14) and/or the transverse beams consist of an expanded 
or non-expanded, reinforced or non-reinforced geopolymer foam 

material. 
Wall element according to claim 1 or 2,
 
characterised in that, 


the stays (1, 14) and/or transverse beams consist of reinforced or 
non-reinforced concrete. 
Wall element according to any one of the preceding claims 1 to 4,
 
characterised in that, 


the stays (1, 14) and plates (8) are of a mutually complementary form 
in their surface portions which are in mutual contact or engagement 

and are preferably adhered to each other. 
Wall element according to any one of the preceding claims 1 to 5,
  
 

characterised in that, 

the stays (1, 14) - as seen in the cross-sectional view - are 
symmetrical with respect to the central plane (4) which extends 

perpendicular to the datum plane of the wall element. 
Wall element according to any one of the preceding claims 1 to 6,
 
characterised in that, 


the broad side (12) of a stay (1) - as seen perpendicular to the datum 
plane of the wall element - is arranged offset, and 
when the stay (1) is produced from a different material than that of the 
plates (8) the space created by the extent of the displacement is filled 

by a plate (13) which is produced from the identical material as the 
plate (8). 
Wall element according to any one of the preceding claims 1 to 7,
 
characterised in that, 


at least two extensive, framework-like, mutually connected 
arrangements consisting in each case of stays (1, 14), transverse 

beams or the like, which are intended and designed to carry static 
loads and consist of an inorganic material are provided - as seen 

perpendicular to the datum plane of the wall element, 
wherein plates (8) consisting of an inorganic foam material are 
inserted into the spaces existing in the arrangements, and  

 
the arrangements are attached to each other by way of the stays (1, 
14) and/or transverse beams. 
Wall element according to claim 8,
 
characterised in that, 


in the longitudinal central plane (7) a gap (9) extends between the two 
respective plates (8), and 
inserted into this gap (9) is a heat- and/or sound-insulating material, 
for example in the form of plates or mats or any other form. 
Wall element according to claim 9,
 
characterised in that, 


the material introduced into the gap (9) is an organic foam material, 
for example a polyurethane foam material. 
Wall element according to any one of claims 8 to 10,
 
characterised in that, 


the chamfered surfaces (3) or any other profiling of the stays (1, 14) 
of two mutually adjacent arrangements - as seen perpendicular to the
