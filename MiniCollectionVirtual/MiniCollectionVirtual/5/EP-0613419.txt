<ABSTRACT>
A tube of layered material having at least a main layer and a barrier layer, for use in transporting and storage of hydrocarbons such as petrol, kerosene, diesel oil, fuel oil, natural gas, LPG and other similar hydrocarbons, which show similar chemical and physical properties as the properties of diffusion through plastic materials, in which tube the main layer essentially comprises polyethene or polypropene, e.g. MD-polyethene and the barrier layer comprises polyethene or polypropene, e.g. HD-polyethene, in combination with any of the following components, butyl rubber, polyamide and polyester.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to tubes and containers for
transport and storage of petrol and hydrocarbons of a type
similar to petrol, typically for use in petrol station
installations and other similar installations where petrol or
other hydrocarbons as i.a. kerosene, diesel oil, fuel oil,
natural gas, LPG, or the like are stored in tanks and from
there supplied to e.g. the pumps in the filling station.
Among the areas of usage for these tubes the following may be
mentioned, pipes for venting and return of gases and other
distributional areas.In installations of the type referred to above it
has been common to use galvanized tubes each having a length
of 6 meters, which means that the tubes have to be joined
together. A joint always represents a threat of leakage. This
threat is heightened by the fact, that the weather changes
during the seasons of the year, gives effects from movements
in the ground which effects cannot be entirely avoided. It
must of course be pointed out that even if the tubes are laid
in the form of a continous hose of a plastic material,
suitable for the application, the forces from the ground
movements remain, but on account of the inherent properties
of the material the results of the existing forces may be
essentially eliminated. However the risk for leakage of
hydrocarbons by diffusion remains.The leakage from the tubes generally used for this
purpose may approximately be estimated to 0.4 g/meter and 
month, i.e. 2,5 l/meter and year. This estimate refers to
polyethene tubes of the usual types. In addition to polyethene
tubes, also tubes of glass fiber reinforced plastic
material is used.The object of the invention is thus tubes or containers
for transport and/or storing of petrol or hydrocarbons
having similar properties, tubes manufactured from a material,
said material being chemically compatible with said
hydrocarbons and said material a reduced absorbtion as to
transported or stored hydrocarbons. Moreover the tubes are
diffussion resistant to such an extent that they may be
installed in the ground with a higher degree of safety than
the tubes existing up to now.Generally speaking, most polyolefines may be used
for transporting petrol bearing in mind that most of the
polyolefines show resistance towards petrol to a greater or
smaller extent. Among these are polyethene and polypropylene,
which materials are chemically inert and which also show
favourable properties when used in connection with hydrocarbons.
The most common use in this context is fuel tanks
for installation in
