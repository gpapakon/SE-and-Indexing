<ABSTRACT>
A device for cleaning a basin, in particular for removing sludge (mud) or sand, which has a cleaning unit for taking up the materials to be separated off and for further conveyance to a transfer position for disposal and is also provided with a travel unit which is provided with a steering device and a drive for producing a travelling motion of the cleaning unit, is to be designed for achieving a simple construction and so as to be able to be matched for use in basins of various dimensions. This is achieved according to the invention by the moveable cleaning device (1) being provided with at least a first sensor (8) for recognising the amount and/or the location of the materials to be removed which are present, and by a computer unit (10) being present, which computer further processes output signals of the sensor (8) as control parameter for generating computer output signals for the steering device (7) to give a flexible travelling motion matched to the amount and/or the location of the materials present and by means of which the travel unit (3) can be moved in various directions.

Device for cleaning a basin, in particular for removing 
sludge or sand, having a transportable cleaning device 

(1) for receiving the substances to be separated off 
and for carrying them onward to a transfer point for 

disposal, wherein the said cleaning device (1) has a 
cleaning unit (2) and a transporting unit (3) which is 

provided with a travel control arrangement (7) and a 
travel drive (5) for producing the transporting 

movement on the floor of the basin, and wherein at 
least one sensor is present for identifying the 

accumulated materials to be separated off, as a result 
of which a control unit triggers and controls the 

transporting movement in dependence upon the 
accumulation of the substances to be separated off, 


characterised in that
 at least one first sensor (8) for 
identifying the location, or the location and quantity, 

of the accumulated substances to be separated off is 
provided on the transportable cleaning device (1), and 

that a computer unit (10) further processes output 
signals from the first sensor (8) as a guide quantity 

for producing computer output signals for the travel 
control arrangement (7) for flexible transporting 

movement adapted to the location, or to the location 
and quantity, of the accumulated substances, as a 

result of which the cleaning device (1) can be 
transported, with the aid of its transporting unit (3), 

in different directions as an automatically 
transportable structural unit, according to the 

location of the aggregation of substances to be 
separated off. 
Device according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the 
computer unit (10) has artificial intelligence, as a 

result of which it emits to the travel control unit 
(7), in the case of identical starting situations,  

 
different control signals for optimising the 

transporting movement of the cleaning device (1). 
Device according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 
a second sensor (9) is provided for establishing the 

consistency of the substances to be removed, and is 
connected to the computer unit (10). 
Device according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the 
travel movement of the cleaning device (1) can be 

controlled by guide lines integrated into the basin. 
Device according to claim 4, 
characterised in that
 the 
said guide lines are orientated vertically and 

horizontally in relation to one another, in the form of 
a matrix. 
Device according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 
there is provided, for receiving the substances to be 

separated off, an extracting device, the suction power 
of which can be adapted, by the computer unit (10), to 

the differing quantities of the substances to be 
separated off. 
Device according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the 
cleaning device (1) is connected, for carrying the 

substances to be separated off onwards through a hose 
(23), to a central transfer point (24). 
Device according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 
there is provided, for delivering the substances 

received by the cleaning device (1), a transportable 
tubular bridge (37), with the aid of which the 

substances to be delivered are delivered into a channel 
(33) disposed at the edge of the basin on at least one 

side.  
 
Device according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the 
cleaning device (1) is in communication with a tube 

(31) of variable length above a channel disposed 
parallel to the edge of the basin. 
Device according to claim 5 or 6, 
characterised in that
 
the cleaning device (1) has at least two sludge-clearing 

tools (16, 16a) or sludge-extracting devices 
which operate in different directions of travel. 
Device according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the 
cleaning device (1) contains an intermediate reservoir 

for the substances to be separated off. 
Device according to claim 11, 
characterised in that
 the 
delivery, from the intermediate reservoir to a defined 

transfer point, of the substances to be separated off 
takes place in dependence upon the path of travel of 

the cleaning device (1). 
Device according to claim 10, 
characterised in that
 the 
transportable cleaning device (1) is provided with at 

least one clearing plate (16, 16a) which operates on 
the floor of the basin, and that at least one receiving 

funnel is provided at the transfer point in the floor 
of the basin. 
Device according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 at 
least two sensor-controlled cleaning devices (1) are 

movably disposed on a transverse bridge submerged in 
the basin, in such a 
way that an assigned cleaning 
area, in each case, is swept by each cleaning device 

(1).
