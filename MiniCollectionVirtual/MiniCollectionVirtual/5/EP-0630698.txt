<ABSTRACT>
A take-out arbor (35) for receiving strip 
material (S) in a strip accumulator (20, 26) of a strip 

processing line includes a main mandrel (36) and a 
secondary mandrel (37) carried by the main mandrel (36). A 

plurality of rollers (67) are carried by the mandrels (36, 
37), one end of each roller (67) being supported by the 

main mandrel (36) and the other end of each roller (67) 
being supported by the secondary mandrel (37). The main 

mandrel (36) is pivotally mounted to a frame (27 or 87) of 
the accumulator (20 or 26), and when the mandrels (36, 37) 

are pivoted, the secondary mandrel (37) rotates with 
respect to the main mandrel (36) such that the other end of 

each roller (67) pivots with respect to the one end of each 
roller (67) to align the rollers (67) with the strip 

material (S). The take-out arbor (35) can be utilized with 
both a vertically oriented accumulator (20) and a 

horizontally oriented accumulator (26). When operating in 
a horizontally oriented accumulator (26), the strip 

material (S) leaves the accumulator (26) with its edge 
parallel to the floor, traveling in the same direction that 

it was received by the accumulator (26). The strip 
material (S) may then be provided to a turnaround assembly 

(91) which redirects the strip material (S) to the 
processing line in a different direction back over the top 

of the accumulator (26).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus for accumulating strip material in a processing 
line. Many industrial processing lines utilize a strip 
material, such as a metallic strip material, as an input 
and require that the strip be continually fed thereto. As 
a practical matter, the strip is payed out from a coil 
until depleted. Because it would be highly undesirable to 
stop the processing line upon each depletion of a coil, 
vertically oriented strip accumulators, such as that shown 
in US-A-3506210, have been developed to 
receive strip from the input coil and hold or store a 
quantity of the same while at the same time paying out 
strip so held to the processing line. Such accumulators 
thus utilize the strip stored therein to permit the 
processing line to remain active during the time a new 
input coil is attached, as by welding, to the end of a coil 
which has just been depleted. Often times it is possible that the processing 
line will utilize strips of varying widths throughout the 
normal working day or week. When a change of strip width 
is desired, using the type of accumulator of the aforesaid 
US-A-3506210, a major alignment problem exists. 
Essentially all strip processing lines are designed to 
receive strip material along the centre line of the width 
thereof. Thus, the strip which exits the accumulator must  
 
exit at a point such that the centre line of the width of the strip is in line with the 
processing equipment. In order to accomplish this requirement, accumulators 
made in accordance with the aforesaid US-A-3506210 dictate that the strip be fed 
thereto from the coil with the centre line of the width of the coil at the proper 
position so that the strip will exit aligned with the processing equipment. This 
requires complex adjustments of the position of the coil each and every time the 
coil width is changed to assure that the coil is properly centred with respect to the 
accumulator. While adjustable uncoilers are available for this purpose, they are 
quite expensive and often prove difficult and time consuming to properly adjust. Another example of the prior art is shown in our US-A-3885748 
which generally discloses apparatus for accumulating strip material in a processing 
line comprising a support member, an arbor receiving the strip material and being 
pivotally mounted on the support member, a plurality of rollers supported on the 
arbor, and means to pivot the arbor relative to the support member. More particularly, the apparatus of our aforesaid US-A-3885748 
provides
