<ABSTRACT>
In order to monitor the leaktightness of pipelines, the invention provides a testable pipe joint which exhibits the following features:     a) The pipe joint to be tested has two sleeve seals (3, 4), located one on top of the other, on the pipe inner side in order to achieve the sealing action; b) The elastomer sleeves are pressed on and fixed by in each case one clamping ring which covers them or by two open clamping rings (5) which are arranged at their longitudinal edges, are directed towards the pipe interior and can be expanded outwards; c) A cavity (6) with a connection line (10) which leads to the outside is located between the two seals (3, 4); d) In the cavity (6), a liquid or gaseous medium (testing agent) is under superatmospheric or subatmospheric pressure during the testing period; and   e) The cavity (6) is connected to a pressure-measuring device (9).

Pipe joint comprising a testing device for controlling the seal of a 
pipe joint, in particular of pipes for drainage channels and pipes 

which can be walked in, 
characterised by
 a combination of the 
following features: 


a) the pipe joint has a seal arranged at its interior and comprising 
two stacked elastomer sleeves (3, 4); 
b) the elastomer sleeves (3, 4) are respectively pressed onto the 
tube interior wall and fixed by two respective clamping rings 

(5) of stainless steel or plastic, which are arranged at their 
longitudinal edges and oriented towards the pipe interior, 

outwardly expandable, open and made in one piece or 
composed of a plurality of segments, and one or more fitting 

pieces or a clamping device or a plurality of mechanical 
clamping devices are inserted between the open ends of e
ach 
clamping ring or the circular segments in order to seal the ring; 
c) between the two elastomer sleeves (3, 4) lies a cavity (6) 
which is connected via an outwardly oriented connecting pipe 

(10, 11) to a pressure measuring device (9) which permits a 
positive or negative pressure in the cavity (6) to be controlled; 
d) this cavity (6) contains, at least during the test duration, a 
liquid a gaseous medium as a testing medium under positive 

or negative pressure. 
Pipe joint according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 a third 
floating clamping ring is installed between the two respective outer 

clamping rings (5) for the purpose of supporting the sleeves (3, 4). 
Pipe joint according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the 
clamping rings (5) cover and support the entire elastomer sleeve 

(3,4) with the exception of a narrow centre gap. 
Pipe joint according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 a single 
clamping ring (5), which is preferably made of stainless steel, 

covers the entire elastomer sleeve (3. 4).  
 
Pipe joint according to Claim 4, 
characterised in that,
 in place 
of a wide elastomer sleeve (3, 4), two narrow seal profiles are 

used at each pipe end. 
Pipe joint according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 the 
clamping elements (5), which co-act with a sleeve (3, 4) are 

fitted with a respective profile, in particular a U-profile, and those 
profiles which are oriented towards each other serve as a guide 

for subsequently insertible light steel plates to support the 
sleeve. 
Pipe joint according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in 
that
 the cavity (6) is connected to a sealable testing medium 
pipe (8) which connects to a disconnectible positive or negative 

pressure source. 
Pipe joint according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in 
that
 the pressure medium device (9) is built into the testing 
medium pipe (8). 
Pipe joint according to one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in 
that
 the testing medium pipe (9) extends at least on a section of 
its total length within the wall of one or both of the pipes (1). 
Pipe joint according to Claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that
 the 
cavities (6) of a plurality of pipe joints are connectible to one and 

the same testing medium pipe (8). 
Pipe joint according to one of s 1 to 10, 
characterised in that
 
the pressure measuring device (9) is connected to a signalling 

device which automatically triggers on reaching a specified 
positive or negative pressure or at normal air pressure. 
Pipe joint according to one of Claims 1 to 11, 
characterised in 
that
 the seal is repairable in the event of a leak by re-tightening 
the clamping rings (5) or by replacing at least one of the two 

sleeves (3, 4). 
Pipe joint according to one of Claims 1 to 12, 
characterised in 
that
 a conventional sealing ring (2) is fitted at the side of the 
pipe joint oriented towards ground water for the purpose of 

protecting the inner seal (3).
