<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a method and an apparatus for
classifying and recovering the main components of used
batteries. More specifically, it concerns a method and an
apparatus by which the batteries are conveyed on a conveyor
while an alternating magnetic field is applied to each. A
detection means detects what sort of induced magnetic field has
resulted from the eddy current induced in the battery and in
this way determines what sort of battery it is. The batteries
being conveyed on the conveyor are brought to within a fixed
distance of the detection means, and their travel path is
constrained so as to maintain highly accurate detection.In order to prevent environmental pollution, make the
fullest possible use of natural resources and aid recycling, it
is desirable to classify used batteries according to their main
components.Devices have therefore been developed which can be used to
classify used batteries without destroying them. Such
apparatus apply an alternating magnetic field to a used battery
to generate an eddy current. By measuring the magnetic field
induced by this eddy current, one can classify the battery
according to its main components.However, the exterior of a battery is usually covered with
an ornamental steel jacket which has a tendency to influence
the magnetic characteristics.In Japanese Patent Publication 6-215802, a design was
proposed in which an alternating magnetic field was applied to
the used battery and a very large magnetostatic field (a quasi-magnetostatic
field) was also applied. The magnetostatic field
would magnetically saturate the steel jacket.The battery separator proposed in Japanese Patent
Publication 6-215802 is characterized by the following
features. It has at least one excitation coil (20), which is
connected to three excitation means (21, 22 and 23) and which 
generates an alternating magnetic field; a positioning means to
position the battery or storage battery (10) in the alternating
magnetic field; three detection means (30, 31 and 32), which
measure the induction while the battery or storage battery (10)
is in the alternating magnetic field; and four means (41, 42,
24 and 34) to induce a quasi-magnetostatic field in the battery
whose properties are being measured via the induction. The
quasi-magnetostatic field will virtually saturate at least a
part of the ferromagnetic portion of the battery or storage
battery (10).The numbers given above are those used in the drawings
appended to Patent Publication 6-215802.As is explained in the Patent Publication
