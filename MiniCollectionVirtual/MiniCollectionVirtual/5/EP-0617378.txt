A surface acoustic wave apparatus includes a 
surface acoustic wave (SAW) element and a matching 

circuit (16). The SAW element includes a piezoelectric 
substrate (11), two generation electrodes (12,13) provided on the 

piezoelectric substrate, for generating a first surface 
acoustic wave and a second surface acoustic wave, 

respectively, and an output electrode (14) provided on the 
piezoelectric substrate, for propagating the first and 

second surface acoustic waves in mutually opposite 
directions to extract a convolution signal of the first 

and second surface acoustic waves. The matching 
circuit effects impedance matching between the element 

and an external circuit. In the apparatus at least a 
part of the matching circuit is formed on the 

piezoelectric substrate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a surface 
acoustic wave (SAW) element such as a SAW convolver, a 
signal receiver using it, and a communication system 
using it. Fig. 1 is a schematic plane view to show the 
structure of a conventional SAW apparatus. In Fig. 1, 
reference numeral 11 designates a piezoelectric 
substrate, and 12, 13 two interdigital electrodes for 
SAW generation formed at a proper distance to each 
other on the surface of substrate 11 as opposed to each 
other. Numeral 14 denotes an output electrode formed 
between the electrodes 12, 13 on the surface of 
substrate 11. Numeral 15 represents a printed circuit 
board for example of glass epoxy, 16 a matching circuit 
formed on the printed circuit board 15, and 17 a wire 
for electrically connecting the output electrode 14 
with the matching circuit 16. In this SAW apparatus, when an electric signal 
of angular frequency ω is input into the SAW generation 
interdigital electrode 12, 13, a surface acoustic wave  
 
of the frequency is generated at each electrode. The 
surface acoustic waves propagate in mutually opposite 
directions along the output electrode 14, and the 
parametric mixing phenomenon generates an electric 
signal of a product of the two signals with angular 
frequency 2ω in the output electrode 14. This electric 
signal is integrated over the output electrode 14, 
which becomes a convolution electric signal of the 
above two input signals. The mechanism of generating the convolution 
signal is described in detail for example in Shibayama, 
"Applications of Surface Acoustic Wave," TELEVISION, 
30, 457 (1976). An impedance of output electrode 14 is normally 
different from that of an external circuit. Thus, the 
output electrode 14 is connected through the wire 17 to 
the matching circuit 16 formed on the printed circuit 
board 15 for example of glass epoxy. In Fig. 1, the 
matching circuit 16 is constructed of a distributed 
constant line on the printed circuit board 15, which is 
composed of an open stub 161 and a transmission line 
162. The open stub 161 functions mainly as a parallel 
connection capacitance, while the transmission line 162 
mainly as a series connection inductance. The matching 
circuit 16 can be expressed as an equivalent circuit 
shown in Fig. 2 accordingly. Then, the matching 
circuit 16 changes the impedance to obtain an output  
 
matched in impedance with the external circuit. The 
open stub is left free at its one end as an open end. 
Also, the distributed constant line is a line in which
