<ABSTRACT>
A bidirectional radio system for low cost, high through-put accumulation of data from a large number of site units. The site units are connected to remote radio transceivers in radio communication with a plurality of base stations (44). Accurate frequency synchronization allows multiple carriers within a 12.5 kHz FCC bandwidth. Frequency synchronization is achieved at low cost by transmitting a high accuracy carrier and clock signal at a base station, and using receiving circuitry (54) at remote stations to extract the base clock signal and base carrier frequency and a phase-lock loop (258 and 248) to stabilize the remote station carriers. The reception circuitry at a remote station provides independent carrier frequency and clock rate recovery, a phase-lock loop at baseband, and a coarse clock rate recovery circuit (316) coupled to a fine clock rate recovery circuit (320). Remote station responses are time domain multiplexed. A base station receiver can decode a very short remote station response by scaling the response with the phase and amplitude of an initial segment of the response. Spatial reuse of carrier frequencies further increases the rate of data throughout.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to
bidirectional radio communication systems, and more
particularly to bidirectional radio communication
systems wherein one transceiver transmits frequency
reference information to other transceivers, the radio
communication system providing load control or utility
use monitoring.In a typical two-way radio communication system,
a base station operating on one frequency transmits to a
remote station, and the remote station transmits back to
the base station on a related frequency. The
relationship between the transmission frequencies of the
base and remote stations is determined by the licensing
rules of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).
For instance, in the Multiple Address System band the
base station and remote frequencies are separated by 24
megahertz (MHz).A dual carrier radio communication system becomes
problematic when high through-put communications are
required with a large number of stations spread over a
large geographic area. One base station transmitter in
communication with a number of remote stations will have
a through-put determined by the bandwidth efficiency, as
measured in bits per second per Hertz. High bandwidth
efficiency transceivers are prohibitively expensive in
systems which require many remote transceivers. In 
addition, if one powerful base station is transmitting
over a large area there will be regions with poor
reception, i.e. dead spots, due to geographic
irregularities.Alternatively, through-put may be increased by
transmission of a plurality of carriers within an FCC
approved band. This is termed frequency division
multiplexing. The cost of this approach is usually in
the increased frequency accuracy required of the radio
transmitters. Frequency division multiplexing offers
the additional advantage that the frequencies can be
spatially reused; transmission regions (cells) which
utilize the same pair of carrier frequencies are
separated by cells which utilize different pairs of
carrier frequencies, thereby minimizing interference.
The through-put of such systems is equal to the product
of the bandwidth efficiency, the number of cells in the
system and the bandwidth of the carriers.Accurate frequency control is conventionally
accomplished by using quartz crystal resonators. With
careful manufacturing techniques and control of
temperature effects, an accuracy of a few parts-per-million
is obtainable. Another standard frequency
control technique utilizes feedback circuitry. For
instance, a transceiver in conjunction with
