<ABSTRACT>
A hyperacuity printing system for rendering bitmapped image data on a 
photosensitive recording medium (14; Fig.1), the bitmapped image data being rendered as an 

array of pixels across the photosensitive recording medium in a fastscan direction, and an 
orthogonal slowscan direction. This system includes a data source (23; Fig.1) for supplying 

grayscale input image data and a scanning device (17; Fig.1) for rendering grayscale output 
image data onto the recording medium. The scanning device (17; Fig.1) has a device for 

writing scan spots on the recording medium. Further included in this system is transformation 
circuitry (50) for transforming the grayscale input image data into grayscale output image 

data. The transformation circuitry (50) includes a halftoner (70), a thresholder (68), and a 
selection device, where the selection device selects either the thresholder (68) or the halftoner 

(70) to provide the grayscale output image data. Finally, included is a modulating device (18; 
Fig.1) coupled between the transformation circuitry (50) and the scanning device for intensity 

modulating each of the scan spots in accordance with the grayscale output image data.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a printer architecture, and more particularly, to a 
hyperacuity printer architecture. Many of the commercially available laser printers, as well as some of the recently 
introduced electronic copiers, include flying spot raster output scanners (ROS's) for printing 
latent electrostatic images on xerographic photoreceptors. These photoreceptors generally 
have steeply sloped contrast vs. exposure characteristics (high gamma), together with well 
defined exposure thresholds (called the "xerographic threshold"), so they characteristically 
yield high contrast, bitmapped images (e. g., black and white). Some xerographic printers 
operate in a "write black" mode to optically expose the image foreground for printing by 
means of an "exposed area development" process, while others operate in a "write white" 
mode to expose the image background for printing by means of a "charged area 
development" process. As is known, both write black and write white xerography are suitable for color 
printing. So called "full color" xerographic prints customarily are composed by printing three 
or four different color separations (e. g., cyan, magenta and yellow for three color printing, 
and cyan, magenta, yellow and black for four color printing) in superimposed registration on a 
suitable substrate, such as plain paper. Highlight color prints, on the other hand, can be 
produced by printing as few as two color separations (e. g., black and a selected highlight 
color). There is, however, a common thread because each of these color separations generally 
is a high contrast image. It, therefore, will be evident that the fundamental operating 
principles and functional advantages of this invention apply to both monotone and color 
xerography. Many of the ROS's that have been developed for xerographic printing employ a 
single beam or a multi-beam laser light source for supplying one or more intensity modulated 
light beams, together with a scanner (such as a polygon scanner) for cyclically deflecting the 
modulated laser beam or beams across a photoreceptor in a fast scan direction while the 
photoreceptor is being advanced simultaneously in an orthogonal, process or slowscan 
direction. In practice, each of the laser beams typically is brought to focus on or near the 
photoreceptor surface to provide a substantially focused "scan spot." The scan spot or spots, 
in turn, scan the photoreceptor in accordance with a predetermined scan pattern because the 
fastscan deflection of the laser beam or
