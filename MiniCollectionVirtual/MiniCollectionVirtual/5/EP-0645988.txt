<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns an oscillating drive to at least one tooth-cleaning element (19), such as a brush head on an electric toothbrush with a drive unit (1). A first rotational motion about an axis (A2) is first derived from the rotational motion of the drive unit (1) which may be a drive shaft, for instance. This rotational motion is transformed into a cyclic linear motion (L) essentially at right angles to the rotational motion of the drive shaft and transmitted to the tooth-cleaning element (19) to produce at least a reciprocating motion of the tooth-cleaning element.
