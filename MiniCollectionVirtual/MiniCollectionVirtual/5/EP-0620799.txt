<ABSTRACT>
A web winding system (10) for winding adhesive backed web (12) on cores (14) mounted on wind-up spindles (28, 30). The web (12) is supported on a rotating suction drum (24). A knife (32) mounted on a rotating wheel (34) cuts the web (12) against the supporting drum (24). A tab bar (68) is mounted on the wheel (34) adjacent to the knife (32), and applies a tab (60) to the web (12) in registration with the cut. In a second position of the wheel (34) a tab source (70) moves toward the tab bar (68) and applies a tab (60) to its surface (68). The knife (32) is heated by a heater (35) to a temperature above adhesive softening and below adhesive carbonizing to prevent adhesive to stick to or to accumulate on the knife (32). The web (12) is lead to the supporting drum (24) around a stationary gapping roller (18) and a retractable gapping roller (22), mounted on an arm (42) which is pivotable around roller (10). When the knife (32) has cut the web (12) the arm (42) pivots clockwise, and lengthens the distance between retractable roller (22) and supporting drum (24), thus forcing the web to slide on the drum (24), and to form a gap between the leading cut end (36') and the trailing cut end (36) of the web. The gap allows for flying transfer of the web between the cores (14) on the two wind-up spindles (28, 30).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cutting and tabbing assembly 
for use with a web winding apparatus. Pressure sensitive adhesive (PSA) tape, as well 
as other adhesive and non-adhesive tapes and webs, is 
often wound on log rolls, which may, for example, measure 
61 cm wide (24 in) or 122 cm wide (48 in). These log rolls 
are later cut into many individual rolls (each 2.5 cm 
wide, for example) for distribution and sale. In 
operation, a web is typically wound onto a core until a 
predetermined length of web has been wound thereon to form 
a log roll. The web is then stopped and cut transversely, 
so that the log roll can be removed. A tab member, which 
could be a piece of paper, may then be applied along the 
end of the web on the log roll to facilitate grasping of 
the end of the web. The log roll may then be replaced by a 
new core, and the leading cut end of the web may be 
adhered to the core and the web wound therearound to begin 
a new log roll. Known log roll winders of the type described 
above have exhibited several deficiencies relating to 
three distinct systems within the winder. The systems, 
which will be discussed further below, are the cutting 
system for cutting the web across its entire width, the 
tabbing system for applying a tab at a cut end of the web 
across its width, and a winding system for handling the 
web before, during, and after the cutting and tabbing 
operations. With regard to web cutting systems, most known 
cutting systems require that the web handling apparatus be 
stopped while the web is cut. This allows the terminal cut 
end of the web to be secured against the log roll, and  
 
allows the leading cut end of the web to be started on the 
next core. However, it would be desirable to cut the web 
without slowing or stopping the movement of the web. This 
process of performing an operation without stopping the 
line will be referred to herein as performing the 
operation "on the fly" - in this case cutting on the fly. In one web handling system attempted by the 
Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company of St. Paul, 
Minnesota, the assignee of the present invention, the web 
is threaded onto a rotating vacuum drum with the adhesive 
side of the web facing away from the drum. The web is cut 
by rotating a knife against the rotating drum while the 
web is disposed against the surface of the drum. The 
vacuum force exerted by the drum against the web holds the 
cut ends of the web in place to prevent wrinkling. This 
design permits the web to be cut and the leading

<CLAIMS>
A cutting and tabbing assembly for use with a web winding 
system (10), wherein the cutting and tabbing assembly cuts the web 

(12) against a rotating drum (24) as the web (12) rotates and applies 
a tab (60) on the web (12) in registration with a cut end (36) of the 

web, comprising a rotatable knife (32) and a tab source (70), said 
cutting and tabbing assembly being characterized by a tab bar (52) mounted 

adjacent the knife (32); means for moving the tab source (70) from a 
first position spaced from the knife (32) and tab bar (52) to a 

second position adjacent the knife (32) and tab bar (52) to enable 
the tab bar (52) to receive the tab (60) while the knife (32) and tab 

bar (52) are in the second position; and means for rotating the knife 
(32) and tab bar (52) from the second position to a web-cutting 

position to enable the knife (32) to cut the web (12) while the tab 
bar (52) applies the tab (60) onto the web in registration with the cut 

end (36) of the web. 
The cutting and tabbing assembly of Claim 1 wherein the tab 
source (70) comprises an ink jet printer (84) that applies ink to the 

tab bar. 
The cutting and tabbing assembly of Claim 1 wherein the tab 
source (70) is a tab paper unwinder on which a roll (62) of tab paper 

(64) is mounted, wherein the tab bar (52) comprises means for holding 
the tab paper (64), and wherein the means for moving the unwinder 

from a first position to a second position enables the knife (32) to 
cut a tab (60) from the tab paper roll (62). 
The cutting and tabbing assembly of Claim 1 for use with an 
adhesive backed web (12), wherein the knife (32) comprises means (35) 

for preventing the adhesive on the web (12) from sticking on the 
knife and for preventing the adhesive from accumulating on the knife. 
The cutting and tabbing assembly of Claim 4, wherein the 
sticking and accumulating preventing means comprises means (35) for 

heating the knife (32) to temperatures above the temperature at which  
 

the adhesive softens and below the temperature at which the adhesive 
carbonizes. 
The cutting and tabbing assembly of Claim 5, wherein the 
heating means (35) is adapted to heat the knife (32) to temperatures 

between 149째C and 232째C (300째F and 450째F).
