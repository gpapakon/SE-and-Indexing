<ABSTRACT>
A level conversion circuit is disclosed for converting a 
first signal having a first amplitude into a second signal having 

a second amplitude that is larger than the first amplitude. The 
conversion circuit includes a bipolar transistor (Q11) supplied at a 

base thereof with the first signal (EO), a first MOS transistor (M11) 
of a 

first channel type having a gate supplied with a bias voltage (VEEM) and 
a source-drain path connected between the emitter of the bipolar 

transistor (Q11) and an output node from which the second signal is 
derived, and a second MOS transistor (M13) of a second channel type 

having a gate supplied with an inverted signal (EOB) of the first 
signal (EO) and a source-drain path connected between the output node 

and a reference potential line. A PN junction diode (D11) is 
preferably inserted between the third transistor (M13) and the 

reference potential line.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a level conversion circuit 
for a signal of an emitter-coupled-logic (ECL) level and ,more 
particularly, to such a circuit constituted of bipolar 
transistors and complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor 
transistors, i.e. a Bi-CMOS circuit, for responding to an input 
signal of the ECL-level to produce an output signal having an 
amplitude capable of driving a CMOS circuit. As well known in the art, an ECL circuit performs a signal 
processing operation at a very high speed but with a relatively 
large power consumption, and a CMOS circuit performs a signal 
processing operation with small power consumption but at a 
relatively low speed. Accordingly, such a logic circuit is 
widely employed that incorporate both the ECL circuit and the 
CMOS circuit. In this case, a level conversion circuit is 
required to convert a signal of the ECL-level derived from the 
ECL circuit into such a signal that drives the CMOS circuit, as 
well known in the art. Referring to Fig. 1, such a level conversion circuit 
according to a prior art is shown as a typical example. 
Specifically, this prior art circuit is composed of an ECL buffer 
circuit ECL1 and a level converter LC4. The buffer ECL1 includes 
a bipolar transistor Q1 supplied with an input signal IN of the 
ECL-level and a bipolar transistor Q2 supplied with a reference 
voltage VR. These transistors Q1 and Q2 are connected to form 
a differential circuit together with a current source I1 and load 
resistors R1 and R2. The true and complementary intermediate  
 
signals EO and EOB are derived from the collectors of the 
transistors Q2 and Q1, respectively, and supplied to emitter 
follower circuits composed of bipolar transistors Q41 and Q42 and 
current sources I41 and I42 in the level converter LC4. The 
emitter output of the transistor Q41 is supplied to the gates of 
P-channel MOS transistors M41 and M46 and the emitter output of 
the transistor Q42 is supplied to the gates of P-channel MOS 
transistors M42 and M45. A current mirror circuit composed of 
N-channel MOS transistors M43 and M44 is connected between the 
transistors M41 and M42. Similarly, a current mirror circuit 
composed of N-channel MOS transistors M47 and M48 is connected 
between the transistors M45 and M46. The true and complementary 
output signals OUT and OUTB are derived from the sources of the 
transistors M42 and M 46, respectively. With such a circuit as described above, the buffer ECL1 
amplifies of the amplitude, 0.8 V, of the input signal IN up to
