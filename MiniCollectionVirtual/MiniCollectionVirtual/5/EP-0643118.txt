<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electroluminescent (EL)
element using polythiophene and more particularly, to an
electroluminescent element having layered thin films of organic
compounds and adapted to emit light upon application of an
electric field thereacross.Organic electroluminescent (EL) elements include a thin
film containing a luminescent organic compound interposed
between a cathode and an anode. Electrons and holes are
injected into the thin film where they are recombined to create
excitons. Light is emitted by utilizing luminescence
(phosphorescence or fluorescence) upon deactivation of
excitons. The organic EL elements are characterized by plane
light emission at a high luminance of about 100 to 10,000 cd/m2
with a low voltage of about 10 volts and light emission in a
spectrum from blue to red color by a simple choice of the type
of fluorescent material.The organic EL elements, however, are undesirably short in
effective life, less durable and less reliable because of the
following factors. 
(1) Physical changes of organic compounds: Growth of
crystal domains renders the interface non-uniform, which causes
deterioration of electric charge injection ability, short-circuiting
and dielectric breakdown of the element.
Particularly when a low molecular weight compound having a
molecular weight of less than 500 is used, crystal grains
develop and grow, substantially detracting from film quality.
Even when the interface with ITO is rough, significant
development and growth of crystal grains occur to lower
luminous efficiency and allow current leakage, ceasing to emit
light. Local dark spots are also formed.(2) Oxidation and stripping of the cathode: Although
metals having a low work function such as Na, Mg and Al are
used as the cathode in order to facilitate electron injection,
these metals are reactive with oxygen and moisture in air. As
a result, the cathode can be stripped from the organic compound
layer, prohibiting electric charge injection. Particularly
when a polymeric compound is applied by spin coating, the
residual solvent and decomposed products resulting from film
formation promote oxidative reaction of the electrodes which
can be stripped to create local dark spots.(3) Low luminous efficiency and increased heat build-up:
Since electric current is conducted across an organic compound,
the organic compound must be placed under an electric field of
high strength and cannot help heating. The heat causes
melting, crystallization or decomposition of the organic
compound, leading to
