<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to synthetic polymeric fibrous
materials. More specifically, this invention relates to hollow
trilobal cross-section fibers.The term "fiber" as used herein includes fibers of extreme or indefinite
length (i.e., filaments) and fibers of short length
(i.e., staple). The term "yarn" as used herein means a continuous
strand of fibers.For many uses of fibrous synthetic polymers, it is desirable to
minimize the weight of fiber needed to spread over an area. This
qualitative property of a fiber is known as "cover". Another
quality of fibers for certain end uses (like for carpet yarn) is
the fiber's ability to hide soil. Additionally, it is important
that contract carpets stand up to the severe wear these carpets
get due to high traffic. Particularly important to contract carpeting
are pile height recovery and appearance retention after
wear traffic.Trilobal fibers are known to provide cover superior to round
cross-sections and it is known to make trilobal and pseudo-trilobal
fibers (e.g., deltas, T-shapes). Exemplary are U.S. Patent
No. 3,981,948 to Phillips, U.S. Patent No. 3,194,002 to Raynolds
et al., U.S. Patent No. 2,939,201 to Holland, U.S. Patent
No. 4,492,731 to Bankar et al. and Japanese Kokai 42-22574.It is also known to provide voids in fibers and that many times
these voids result in improved soiling hiding performance. However,
lower void volumes (less than about 10%) can result in carpeting
with a high streak potential. U.S. Patent No. 3,745,061 to
Champaneria et al. and U.S. Patent No. 4,407,889 to Gintis et al.
show non-round fibers having one or more voids.It is known also to provide trilobal or pseudo-trilobal fibers
which have one or more voids. Exemplary are U.S. Patent
No. 3,095,258 to Scott, U.S. Patent No. 3,357,048 to Cobb, Jr.,
U.S. Patent No. 3,493,459 to McIntosh et al., U.S. Patent
No. 3,558,420 Opfell, U.S. Patent No. 4,279,053 to Payne et al.,
U.S. Patent No. 4,364,996 to Sugiyama, U.S. Patent No. 4,956,237
to Samuelson, British Patent No. 843,179 to Siemer et al. and
particularly EP-A-516 119. U.S. Patent No. 4,648,830 to Peterson et al. discloses a spinneret
for manufacturing hollow trilobal cross-section fibers. The
fibers disclosed therein have one axially extending hole in each
lobe.To address the foregoing deficiencies, the present invention concerns
a trilobal synthetic polymeric thermoplastic fiber having a
single void extending approximately axially central, a total
cross-section void area between greater than about 10 and 20 percent
void,
