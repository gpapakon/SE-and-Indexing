<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magnetic
recording medium, particularly to a coat-type magnetic
recording medium, e.g., a cassette tape for a digital
audio unit, in which a magnetic layer is formed by
applying a magnetic paint onto a non-magnetic support.In recent years, there have been demands for
information recording on a magnetic tape with a higher
density, in accordance with an improvement of
record/playback instruments. Further, in various kinds
of record/playback instruments, a digital recording
method has been adopted for recoding on a magnetic tape
in place of a conventional analog recording method. In
the field of audio units, a digital audio tape recorder
(referred to as DAT hereinafter) and a digital compact
cassette tape recorder (referred to as DCC hereinafter)
for commercial uses have been developed and commercialized
using these improved techniques.Similar to conventional video cassette recorders
(referred to as VCR hereinafter), DAT has a
record/playback head disposed on a rotation cylinder
and performs record/playback with the same
record/playback mechanism as that of VCR using a
DAT tape. Accordingly, in DAT, magnetic recording
media other than a tape only for DAT can not be used
for record/playback operation. This inconvenience has
prevented DAT from being accepted by a wide range of
users, even after five years of commercialization. In consideration of such a situation of DAT,
DCC was developed as a digital recording tape compatible
with a compact cassette tape of an analog recording
method (referred to as an ACC tape hereinafter) which
has had widespread usage, and as a record/playback
system using the same. The DCC has a fixed type
multi-channel head to which thin film formation techniques
for a semiconductor are applied. This enables
information recording with a high efficiency by means
of signal compression techniques. In light of its
compatibility with the ACC tape, this DCC is expected
to be widespread in the future, and lately much attention
has been paid thereto.The following are requirements for DCC tape,
which are more strict than those for conventional DAT
tape or ACC tape.First, for keeping upper compatibility with
the ACC tape as well as performing recording in a
digital method, information has to be recorded on a
DCC tape with a high density at an extremely slow relative
speed (4.78 cm/sec) between the head and the tape.
For this purpose, the shortest recording wavelength has
to be 1 µm or less. Also, for using the multi-channel
head, it is necessary to make the
