<ABSTRACT>
A lock (19) which by physical or logical means controls human access to an objective (29) such as a restricted area or a computer system is controlled by a data processing system (10) which has access to a store of authorised users (14) and a store of complex images (15), specifically images of human faces. Each authorised user knows certain ones of the complex images, and these key images are linked to an identity statement unique to that user. On receipt of an identity statement signifying an authorised user, a matrix of images including the key images is presented to the user on a display (12), and by means of a suitable input device (20) the user must identify which images are his key images in order to confirm authorisation and be permitted access. The user and image stores (18) may be carried in credit card form as a section of an optical disk. The high security of the system results from the inability of a person to communicate adequately to another the ability to recognise a third person or other complex image.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to personal identification devices, and to
various applications of such devices, which in particular include
access control systems, as well as authentication and encryption
systems. Examples of access control systems are door entry systems
and computer access control systems. Such systems may include a
lock, permitting or denying access. A lock may be physical, when
used on a gate, or logical, as might be used in software access
control.There are many situations where it is desirable or necessary to
control the access of personnel to certain objectives, which may be
physical locations (such as large sites, specific buildings, or
specific areas within buildings) or may be computer systems or
parts thereof. Access to such objectives may need to be controlled
for various reasons, such as to prevent malicious damage to or
theft of either material equipment or data and information, to
prevent fraud, or to preserve security of all kinds.Access control systems are generally linked to personal
identification devices, and many such systems and devices are
known. Personal identification devices may be physical, such as
key devices (eg encoded cards) or identity cards, or abstract, such
as memorised passwords or personal identification numbers (PINs).
Any system that relies on the possession of a physical device is at
risk of being compromised by transfer of the device to unauthorised
users, deliberately or by loss or theft, or damage to the device.
These factors impose considerable burdens on system administrators
to ensure that passwords and PINs are frequently changed and that 
operating standards are kept high enough to ensure that the
integrity of the system is not broken.GB-A-2 058 417 proposes a code word made up of a combination of
symbols, chosen from letters, numerals and pictures of simple
geometric shapes. These are said to be easier to remember than
a multi-digit number. The user's key symbols are encoded on a
card, and he uses a switch to select the same symbols from a
display of many symbols, thus making it harder for another
person to see and make note of the symbols than the input of a
multi-digit number on a keyboard.GB-A-2 112 190 uses a question and answer technique, dependent
upon the unauthorised user not knowing the stored answers to
certain questions.GB-A-2 173 970 and JP-A-56 149 880 both rely, in different
ways, upon taking video pictures of the actual user of a card
as a security measure.Other possible solutions lie in the use of biometric devices
which attempt to

user is required to correctly identify that image by offering
his own real time image for matching with the key image.
A method according to claim 12 further characterised in
that the real time image is derived from a video camera and is

both stored and displayed adjacent the key image for visual
matching.

characterised in that access is permitted by setting a lock to

an open state.
A lock capable of a closed state and an open state and
having control means (61) for controlling the state of the

lock, wherein the control means comprises means (42) for
