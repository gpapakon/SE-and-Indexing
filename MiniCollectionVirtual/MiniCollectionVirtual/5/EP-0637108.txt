<ABSTRACT>
A wavelength multiplexing tapered fused fibre coupler (10) is used 
to splice a second length of optical amplifier fibre (12) between first 

and third lengths (11, 13) in such a way that pump power bypasses 
it. The second length is therefore unpumped and acts as a notch 

filter smoothing out the spectral gain characteristic of the first and 
third lengths.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to optical waveguide amplifiers, typically, but 
not exclusively, erbium doped optical waveguide amplifiers, and 
particularly to gain-shaped optical waveguide amplifiers. Gain-shaping 
in an optical waveguide amplifier is employed to provide a 
more nearly flattened spectral gain characteristic than would 
otherwise occur, and may be accomplished by the use of a notch 
filter as for instance described by M. Tachibana et al in a paper 
entitled 'Erbium-Doped Fiber Amplifier with Flattened Gain 
Spectrum' IEEE Photonics Technology Letters, Volume No. 2, 
February 1991 pages 118-120, to which attention is directed. In the 
absence of smoothing, the gain characteristic of an optical 
waveguide amplifier is liable to exhibit a relatively sharply defined 
peak to the long wavelength side of which is a broader plateau of 
reduced gain. In the case of a typical erbium doped optical fibre 
amplifier pumped at 980 nm, this peak is at about 1535 nm. A 
disadvantage of the notch filter described in the above referenced 
paper is that, because it relies upon the use of a mechanical 
grating to induce mode coupling between a propagating mode and 
a radiating mode whose propagation constant differs by only a 
small amount from that of the propagating mode, it needs to be 
inconveniently long in order to achieve the requisite selectivity. In 
the particular example quoted in that paper the mechanical grating 
extends linearly 390 mm. The present invention is directed to an arrangement employing an 
alternative form of filter. Particularly when implemented in optical 
fibre format, an advantage of the use of the alternative form is that it  
 
does not require as much linear extent because it is in a form that 
is convenient to wind into a coil. According to the present invention there is provided a gain-shaped 
optical waveguide amplifier having a 4-port 2 x 2 coupler which is 
wavelength multiplexing at the pump and signal wavelengths of 
the amplifier, characterised in that the four ports of the 2 x 2 coupler 
are connected to first, second and third lengths of optical amplifier 
waveguide in a configuration such that pump power is directed by 
the coupler directly between the first and the third length while 
signal power is directed from the first to the third via the second 
length of amplifier waveguide. An amplifier according to the present invention relies upon the fact 
that unpumped amplifier waveguide exhibits an absorption peak 
with which the gain peak of pumped amplifier waveguide
