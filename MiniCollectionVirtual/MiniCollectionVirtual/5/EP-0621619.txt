<ABSTRACT>
A line protection circuit breaker is provided with a high-power arc splitter stack (23) and a latching mechanism (19) which can be unlatched electromagnetically and thermoelectrically by means of a bimetallic snap-action disc (52) in the event of an overload in order to open a contact device (21). The bimetallic snap-action disc (52) is held in a supporting body (32) which conducts heat well and at the same time accommodates an electromagnetic field coil (33) having a plunger (42). The plunger (42) can be released electromagnetically and/or by the bimetallic snap-action disc (52) in order to release in the event of an overload, the moving contact (21) remaining open as a result of the latching mechanism (19) unlatching. The latching mechanism (19) can be unlatched, when the plunger (42) is released, via a first arm of a two-armed lever (37) which is mounted on the supporting body (42) such that it can rotate and consists of plexiglass, it being possible for the second arm (41) of the lever (37) to strike the contact device (21), and a baffle (43) for the drive of a plasma column or arc column, which is produced when the contact device (21) is struck, being formed on the second arm, in the direction of the arc splitter stack (23).

<CLAIMS>
A circuit breaker with a heavy-duty arc extinguishing 
means (23) and a switch latch (19), which, in case of 

overload, is electromagnetically and thermoelectrically 
disengageable for opening contact means (21) by means of 

a bimetal snap-on element (52), wherein the bimetal snap-on 
element (52) is held in a carrying element (32) with 

good heat conducting properties, which simultaneously 
receives an electromagnetic exciting coil (33) with a 

plunger (42), and wherein the plunger (42) is 
electromagnetically shiftable through the bimetal snap-on 

element (52), wherein the switch latch (19) is 
disengageable via a first arm (38) of a rotatable two-arm 

lever (37) upon disengaging the plunger (42), wherein 
through the second arm (41) of the lever (37) the contact 

means (21) can be opened, and wherein at the second arm 
(41) an impact wall (43) is formed for the drive of the 

plasma or arc stream column being created when opening 
the contact means (21) in the direction to the 

extinguishing means (23). 
The circuit breaker according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the two-arm lever (37) at the 

carrying element (32) is rotatable mounted on a bearing 
axis (36). 
The circuit breaker according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the carrying element (32) can be 

fixed by means of a bearing axis (36), by which 
simultaneously the two-arm lever (37) is rotatable 

supported. 
The circuit breaker according to claim 2 or 3, 
characterized in that the bearing of the two-arm lever 

(37) is provided at that side of the carrying element 
(32), which faces towards the contact means (21).  

 
The circuit breaker according to one of the previous 
claims, characterized in that the two-arm lever (37) is 

made of an insulating material, which, under electric arc 
effect, emitts gas. 
The circuit breaker according to claim 5, 
characterized in that the two-arm lever (37) is made of 

plexiglass. 
The circuit breaker according to one of the previous 
claims, characterized in that in the carrying element 

(32) a firm plunger guide core (49) and a movable plunger 
actuating armature (47) are arranged. 
The circuit breaker according to one of the previous 
claims, characterized in that the bimetal snap-on element 

(52) is formed as a disk with a central aperture boring 
for the plunger (42), wherin the plunger (42) comprises a 

disk applying projection (54) within the region of the 
disk. 
The circuit breaker according to claim 8, 
characterized in that the snap-on disk (52) in a bimetal 

chamber (51) is centrically arranged before the plunger 
guide core (49) and closely fits to it with its convex 

side. 
The circuit breaker according to claim 8, 
characterized in that the plunger actuating armature is 

axially arranged between the plunger guide core and the 
snap-on disk being which is held in a bimetal chamber and 

that the plunger is guided in the plunger actuating 
armature. 
The circuit breaker according to claim 9 or 10, 
characterized in that the bimetal chamber (51) is closed 

by means of a disk-shaped element (53) made of an 
electric insulating material and comprises an aperture 

and guide boring (55) for the plunger (42).  
 
The circuit breaker according to claim 11, 
characterized in that at the element (53) a receptacle 

for a conductor (27) to the firm contact (26) is formed, 
wherein the conductor (27) is in contact with the 

exciting coil (33) and the extinguishing means (23). 
The circuit breaker according to claim 12, 
characterized in that the bimetal chamber (51) and the 

conductor (27) to the firm contact (26) are both arranged 
at the same side of the carrying element (32).
