<ABSTRACT>
A self-scanning checkout device includes a
registration section (3) having a stationary scanner (9)

for permitting a customer to input article information
for a purchased article, a counter (5) arranged on the

downstream side from the registration section (3) in the
article moving direction, for receiving a purchased

article which has been registered thereon, and a monitoring
section for monitoring a movement of the

purchased article, wherein the monitoring means is
constructed to set a article registration flag when

information of the purchased article is read by the stationary
scanner (9), check the article registration flag

when the passage of an article is detected by article
sensors (10, 11) disposed near and on the downstream

side from the reading position of the stationary scanner
(9), reset the article registration flag when the

article registration flag is detected to be set, and
issue an alarm indicating the passage of an unregistered

article when the article registration flag is detected
to be reset.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a self-scanning checkout 
device with which a customer himself scans and registers 
purchased articles. A conventional self-scanning checkout device has a 
registering section, a carrying-in/weighing section, a 
carrying-out section, and a settlement section. The 
registering section includes a stationary scanner, the 
carrying-in/weighing section includes a carrying-in 
conveyor and a weighing unit, and the carrying-out 
section includes a carrying-out conveyor. The 
registering section, a carrying-in/weighing section, and 
a carrying-out section are arranged in this order along 
the flow of articles. The settlement section is 
constructed by an electronic cash register and disposed 
near the carrying-in/weighing section and carrying-out 
section. This checkout device is disclosed in Jpn. Pat. 
Appln. KOKAI Publication No. 61-46591, for example. In the above device, a customer himself passes 
purchased articles one at a time on the reading surface 
of the stationary scanner to read the article code (bar 
code) thereof and sets the articles on the carrying-in 
conveyer of the carrying-in/weighing section. Then, the 
article code read by the scanner is transmitted to the 
settlement section and real weight data of the article 
weighed by the weighing unit is transmitted to the 
settlement section. As a result, in the settlement  
 
section, article weight data previously set for the 
article code is compared with the real weight data to 
determine whether two weight data items substantially 
coincide with each other or not. When it is determined 
that the two weight data items substantially coincide 
with each other, sales data of the article is registered 
in the settlement section and the article is carried out 
from the carrying-out section via the carrying-in conveyer 
and carrying-out conveyer. When the scanning registration for all of the 
purchased articles by the customer is completed, the 
total amount of the purchased articles is output from 
the settlement section. Therefore, the cashier is only 
required to effect the settlement service in the settlement 
section. Then, the customer puts the carried-out 
articles from the carrying-out section into a bag. In the case of self-scanning system, since the 
customer himself operates the stationary scanner to 
scan and register the purchased articles, it becomes 
important to prevent an erroneous operation caused by 
misunderstanding that the article is registered even 
when the article code cannot be correctly read by the
