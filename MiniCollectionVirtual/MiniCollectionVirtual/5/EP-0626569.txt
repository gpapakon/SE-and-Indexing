<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for monitoring the levels of containers of valuable materials. The object of the invention, to develop a method for monitoring the level of containers of valuable materials, which guarantees a cost-effective monitoring of the levels and an effective, economical emptying of the containers, is achieved in that the levels of the containers 1 of valuable materials are detected by means of an electronic level sensor 1, 14, to which is allocated in each case a unidirectionally operating short-range broadcast module. The level data from the individual containers 1 are transmitted at a defined time interval to a container 4 which executes the master function and to which a broadcast modem 5 is allocated. The container 4 executing the master function sends the level data from the individual containers 1 to a central control station 8 for further processing, at a defined time interval, via the broadcast centre 7.

Procedure for monitoring the filling levels of recycling containers,
characterised by
 the following features,

the filling levels of the recycling containers (1) are registered by an electronic filling level
sensor (3,14), which is allocated a uni-directional, short-distance radio module, and the

filling level data is transmitted from the individual recycling containers (1) to a recycling
container with a master function (4), with a radio modem (5), at a regular interval. The

recycling container with the master function (4) transmits the filling level data of the
individual recycling containers (1) to operation control (8) via a radio station (7) for further

processing, at a defined time interval.
Procedure according to claim No. 1 is characterised by the following features, the short-distance
data transmission is conducted from the individual recycling containers (1) to a

local monitoring unit (6,19), which is fitted with control electronics and a solar power
supply (18) and from which the data transmission to operation control (8) is carried out via

a radio modem (17). The mast (16) contains an antenna for the reception of the filling level
data from the recycling containers (1) and the transmission of the processed data to

operation control (8).
Procedure according to claim No. 2 is characterised by the following features, the local
monitoring unit (19) conducts the infrared data transmission (21) to operational vehicles

nearby (22). 
Procedure according to claims No. 1 or 2 is characterised by the following features, the
measuring and transmitting electronics (3,5,6,17,19) of the recycling container (1,4) are

dimensioned for a low power consumption.
Procedure according to claims No. 1 and 2 is characterised by the following features, the
filling level sensor (3,14) is formed by an electronic ultrasonic measuring system with a

controlling and storing unit.
Procedure according to claims No. 1 and 2 is characterised by the following features, the
filling level of the recycling container (1) is established with the help of light barriers

(10,11) fixed to the inside, regardless of the specific weight of the matter being stored (3).
Procedure according to claims No. 1 and 2 is characterised by the following features, the
filling level of the recycling container (1) is established with the help of light barriers (12),

counting the number of entries through the input openings (2).
Procedure according to claims No. 1 and 2 is characterised by the following features, the
filling level of the recycling containers (1) is established with an acoustic counting system

(14), which registers the number of entries.
Procedure according to claim No. 8 is characterised by the following features, the acoustic
counting system (14) is made up of an electronic ultrasonic measuring system with a

transmitter and a receiver as well as a controlling and storing unit. 
Procedure according to claim No. 8 is characterised by the following features, the acoustic
counting device (14) is fitted with a microphone.
Procedure according to claims No. 1 and 2 is characterised by the following features, the
filling levels of the recycling containers (1) are established with the help of the filling

weight, whereby a coding unit for automatic calibration and adjustment of the weight
measuring device (25) is positioned in the lower frame (24) of the container (1) of varying

types.
Procedure according to claims No. 1 and 2 is characterised by the following features, the
filling levels are established with the help of a pressure foil (28) at the interior walls of the

recycling container (1,4).
Procedure according to claims No 1 to 12 is characterised by the following features, the
registered filling level data is queried by operation control (8) at certain intervals.
Procedure according to claims No 1 to 13 is characterised by the following features, the
power supply of the master recycling container (4) is secured for at least one year with the

help of batteries or accumulators and for at least three years in the case of the slave
recycling containers (1).
Procedure according to claims 1 to 14 is characterised by the following features, the power
supply is secured through solar energy. 
Procedure according to claims 1 and 2 is characterised by the following features, a radio
clock is installed into the measuring and transmitting electronics (3,5,6,17,19).
Procedure according to claims 1 or 2 is characterised by the following features, the filling
levels of the recycling containers (1) are registered hourly and are transmitted to the

recycling container with the master function (4) or to a local monitoring unit (19) which
transmit(s) the filling level data to operation control (8) in a block format.
Procedure according to claims 1 or 2 and 17 is characterised by the following features,
every recycling container (1) is allocated a fixed transmission time for the short-distance

data transmission.
