<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for the variable covering of planar surfaces, in particular for providing interior shade to window or door openings by at least one free-hanging foldable screen. In order, in the case of said device, to configure the movable screen edge, i.e. the screen edge which can be displaced for opening and closing, to the effect that not only rectangular or square surfaces, but also differently shaped surfaces can be at least partially covered, while maintaining an aesthetically pleasing configuration, the invention provides, on the screen edge, a profile strip which is subdivided into two strip sections (3, 4) which are connected to one another in an articulated manner, it being possible, by pivoting the strip sections of the profile strip about the articulated connection, for the foldable screen to be spread out in the form of a fan and/or folded together.
