<ABSTRACT>
Filtering measures, which are split into three levels (A, B, C), are provided for different, intrinsically isolated EMC (electromagnetic compatibility) areas (6, 7, 8) in the electrical power supply route in subsystems, for example in "radio link system cabins" and "command vehicle cabins" of a complex weapon system, which filtering measures not only reduce the emitted conducted and radiated electromagnetic interference but also provide effective protection against individual pulses from the mains electrical power network and against EMP, NEMP and overvoltages resulting, for example, from lightning. The invention can be used particularly for mobile weapon systems which consist of a plurality of functional and mutually communicating subsystems.

Power supply system, which is fed from a separate 
power generation unit via a cable to an AC power supply 

terminal box for communication devices in a subsystem 
within a weapon system which comprises a plurality of 

functional, moving subsystems which communicate with one 
another, in particular for attacking airborne targets, 

characterized in that, in specific subsystems, for 
example in the cabins (1) of radio link systems and 

command vehicles, the power supply is split, after a 
power supply connection unit (2) which, in series, 

contains the power supply terminal box (3), an NEMP 
(Nuclear Electromagnetic Pulse) cable (4) and an intermediate 

transformer (5), by means of an AC switching and 
distribution unit (9) into three decoupled EMC (Electromagnetic 

Compatibility) areas, namely into a telecommunications 
area (6), a route-logic radio interface unit area 

(7) and a radio area (8), in that the separation of the 
areas is implemented from the structural point of view by 

using screened housings, cable screens, filters and 
similar measures, in that each of these subsystems is 

provided with three stages (A, B, C) of filters, in that 
a heavy-current spark gap, an extinguishing spark gap, 

spike suppressors, an inrush current limiter, varistors 
and/or bushing filters are provided in the first stage 

(A) as initial protection to reduce strong current pulses 
(EMP) (Electromagnetic Pulses) and NEMP field pulses in 

the power supply connection unit (2), in that power cable 
filters (10) are provided in the second stage (B) as 

decoupling elements downstream of the AC switching and  
 

distribution unit (9) for each of the three said EMC 
areas, which power supply cable filters (10) comprise 

parallel capacitors and bushing capacitors, series 
inductors and/or parallel resistors and decouple the 

three EMC areas from one another such that no interference 
can respectively be received from the other EMC 

areas, and which additionally dissipate incoming overvoltages, 
for example in the event of a lightning strike, 

and limit external interference voltages, in that 
equipment filters are provided in the third stage (C), as 

final protection to dissipate interference and/or interference 
voltages and interference currents coming from 

the equipment to be supplied, preferably at the socket 
outlets in the AC switching and distribution unit (9) and 

in DC switching and distribution units (12) which are 

arranged after rectifiers (11). 
Power supply system according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that no measures for final protection are 

provided in the EMC area of the route-logic radio interface 
unit after the rectifier (11), but an invertor (13) 

is provided, which supplies the equipment (14) of the 
route-logic radio interface unit. 
Power supply system according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the equipment 

filters which are provided for final protection (C) have 
low-pass elements (T1-T4), series inductors (L1-L6) as 

well as parallel capacitors (C1-C12) and parallel resistors 
(R1-R4).
