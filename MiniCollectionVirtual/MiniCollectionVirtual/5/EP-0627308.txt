Temperature-control device for rotary members in 
printing units, in particular for printing cylinders, inking 

system rollers and/or rubber blanket cylinders, with at 
least one box-like blower (8, 8/1, 8/2) extending along the 

respective rotary member (6, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4) for blowing cold 
air onto the external surface (10) of the respective rotary 

member essentially over its entire length, with a cold air 
generator (12) for generating the cold air at a specific 

temperature, which is arranged externally to the blower, is 
connected to it in terms of flow by at least one cold air 

supply line (13, 14), and comprises an air inlet (16) for 
fresh air and an air outlet for cold air, with at least one 

fan (11, 22) for conveying the cold air, characterised by at 
least one first air recirculating circuit with a first 

return conduit (54/1, 54/2) for the aspiration of cold air 
(65) deflected by the rotary member into the fresh cold air 

supply (66) in the blower (8, 8/1, 8/2) through a vacuum 
region (49) formed in the blower, and by at least one second 

air recirculating circuit with a second return conduit 
(74/1, 74/2; 93) for the aspiration of a proportion of the 

leaking cold stream (72) escaping past the first return 
conduit (54/1, 54/2) along the external surface (10) of the 

rotary member (6) and for the return of this proportion of 
the leaking cold stream (72) to the suction side of the cold 

air generator (12). 
Temperature-control device according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the vacuum region (49) in the blower 

is formed by a fan (11) and/or by a venturi flume (48, 49) 
through which the fresh cold air stream (66) flows and, in 

so doing, generates a vacuum. 
Temperature-control device according to one of claims 1 
or 2, characterised in that means (11) are provided through 

which the cooling effect of the cold air (66) can be  
 

adjusted individually in zones along the rotary member (6) 
over the length of the blower (8, 8/1, 8/2). 
Temperature-control device according to one of claims 1 
to 3, characterised in that several blowers (8, 8/1, 8/2) 

are connected in terms of flow to a common cold air 
generator (12). 
Temperature-control device according to one of claims 1 
to 4, characterised in that the second return conduit (74/1, 

74/2) has an inlet (78) for the aspiration of cold air which 
opposes the rotary member (6) at a point of the deflected 

cold air stream (62, 72) located further downstream than a 
suction inlet (56) of the first return conduit (54/1, 54/2) 

by means of which cold air which is also deflected is 
aspirated from the external surface (10) of the rotary 

member (6). 
Temperature-control device according to one of claims 1 
to 5, characterised in that the blower (8, 8/1) is provided 

with at least one fan (11) for acceleration of the cold air 
directed onto the rotary member (6). 
Temperature-control device according to one of claims 1 
to 6, characterised in that the blower (8, 8/1) has a cold 

air nozzle portion (50) which accelerates the cold air, 
becomes narrower in the direction of flow, is directed 

toward the rotary member (6) and directly opposes it. 
Temperature-control device according to one of claims 1 
to 7, characterised in that the cold air generator (12) is 

provided with a fan (22) for conveyance of the cold air.
