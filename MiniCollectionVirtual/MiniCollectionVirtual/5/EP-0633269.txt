<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a DNA molecule 
with the sequence coding for a mammalian 

luteinizing hormone wherein the codon for 
the amino acid located at position 8 of the 

LHβ chain is replaced by a codon for 
arginine and the codon for isoleucine at 

position 15 of the LHβ chain is replaced by 
a codon for threonine.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to DNA-molecules encoding variants 
of mammamilian luteinizing hormones. Human lutropin or human luteinizing hormone (hLH) belongs 
to the glycoprotein hormone family along with human 
follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), human thyroid 
stimulating hormone (TSH) and human chorionic gonadotropin 
(hCG) (for review see Ryan R.J. et al.1987, Structure-function 
relationships of gonadotropins. Rec Prog Horm Res 
43:383-429). The glycoprotein hormones consist of two 
subunits. The amino acid sequence of the alpha subunit is 
identical or nearly identical for the four human 
glycoprotein hormones. Despite significant homologies 
between the different glycoprotein hormones, the beta 
subunit is responsible for the target organ specificity of 
the hormone. hLH and hFSH which are produced by cells of 
the pituitary gland, regulates the steroid hormone 
production in the human gonads. The beta subunits of hLH 
and hCG are highly homologous. The major difference is the 
additional 24 aa extension at the carboxyterminal of hCGβ 
subunit. The biological action of hLH and hCG is mediated 
through the same receptor. The carbohydrate part plays a significant role in the 
biological action of the glycoprotein hormones. Chemical 
deglycosylation has been used to study the function of Asn 
linked oligosacharide moieties in glycoprotein hormone 
action. This procedure does not affect the interaction 
between the alpha and beta dimers nor the binding of the 
hormone to its receptor. The deglycosylated hormone, 
however, have significantly reduced ability to stimulate 
the cAMP production in target cells despite normal binding 
to the receptor.  The biological effect of the hormone is also indirectly 
influenced by the carbohydrate part, as differences in the 
structure of the carbohydrate moieties will effect the 
circulatory half lifes of the hormone (Baenziger J.U. et 
al. 1992. Circulatory half-life but not interaction with 
the lutropin/chorionic gonadotropin receptor is modulated 
by sulfation of bovine lutropin oligosacharides. Proc Natl 
Acad Sci USA 89:334-338). hLH and hCG, although highly 
similar in peptide sequence and in vitro biological 
activity, have quite different in vivo biological half 
lives. The oligosacharides of hLH when synthesized in the 
gonadotrophs are largely sulfated through mediation of 
enzyme systems specific for the gonadotroph cells of the 
pituitary. Increased sulfation gives hLH a shorter 
circulatory half-life due to removal by hepatic cell 
receptors specific for
