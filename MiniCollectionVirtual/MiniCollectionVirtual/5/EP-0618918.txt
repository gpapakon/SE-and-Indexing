<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of
allyl, aryl and aralkyl magnesium halides in ethereal solvent.The preparation of allyl, aryl and aralkyl magnesium halides in
ethereal solutions is well known. For example, DD-A-260278 describes
the preparation of aryl magnesium halides in di-n-butyl ether and
tetrahydrofuran Solutions. The use of diethyl ether solvent is
common in Grignard reactions but has the significant hazard of a low
flashpoint (-40°C) and auto-ignition temperature (160°C) making it
essential to carry out the process in specially modified process equipment.
Construction of a commercial plant to carry out the process with
diethyl ether necessarily involves high capital cost. Thus, the use of
diethyl ether is both hazardous to the process operators and expensive in
terms of cost of process equipment. Other commonly used alternatives to
diethyl ether such as tetrahydrofuran and glycoldimethyl ether result in
high levels of dimerisation during the reaction, particularly in the
preparation of benzylmagnesium halides. This can be avoided to some extent
by using high ratios of magnesium to the allyl, aryl or aralkyl halide.
However, this causes the process to be more expensive and provides the
further problem of disposing of the magnesium after the reaction.EP 415 247 describes the use of tertiary-butylmethyl ether (t-Bu-O-Me)
as an alternative solvent to the commonly used solvents in the Grignard
reaction. The disclosure demonstrates that at molar ratios of 2.5:1 to
20:1 (particularly 5:1 to 12:1) of magnesium to starting material the yield
of Grignard product and amount of dimerisation is at the level expected
when using diethyl ether as the solvent. The process is technically safer
since this solvent has a flashpoint of -10°C and auto-ignition temperature
of 460°C, but it also has the significant disadvantage that a high molar
ratio of magnesium to starting material is needed to suppress dimerisation.It has now been found that tertiary-butylmethyl ether can be used in
an improved process to give high yields of Grignard products and with a
very low amount of dimerisation in reactions using magnesium and starting
materials in equimolar or nearly equimolar amounts. DD-A-260277
describes the use of tertiary-butylmethyl ether with equimolar
amounts of magnesium and starting material but is concerned only with
the preparation of alkyl magnesium halides. Accordingly the present invention provides for a process for the
preparation of compounds of formula (I) :
