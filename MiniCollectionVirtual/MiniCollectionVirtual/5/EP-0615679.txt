<ABSTRACT>
A method of forming an electronic module assembly is disclosed, plus two such assemblies formed thereby. One module assembly (50) has a bendable base plate (52) upon which circuit components (76) are mounted. A module enclosure device (56) mates with the base plate and has an integrally formed, non-removable support arm (96). During assembly, the base plate (52) is bent around the support arm (96) in a "C" shape. Thus formed, the base plate (52) and the module enclosure device (56) form an internal cavity that holds the circuit components (76).

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S.-A-5 103 375 
(referred to herein as the parent 
application). The present invention relates to electronic module assemblies. 
More particularly, the present invention is directed to providing an 
electronic module having an external housing for protecting components 
located within the module housing. Prior electronic module assemblies are known in which a 
polyimide flex circuit undergoes planar assembly in which a plurality of 
components are mounted on conductive circuit patterns on a polyimide 
film. A plurality of rigidizers plates are provided under various portions 
of the flex circuit film, and after component assembly the rigidizer plates 
are oriented so they are non-coplanar. Then the rigidizer plates are 
mounted to an external protective housing for the module. This prior art 
module assembly and method requires the additional manufacturing 
step of mounting the rigidizer plates to the external protective housing. 
This mounting step may degrade the thermal conduction between the 
rigidizer plate and the extemal housing wherein this thermal conduction 
may be relied upon for providing heat sinking for the components in the 
assembly which are mounted on the flex circuit film. Also, the providing 
of the external housing typically represents a significant cost of the 
module. From US-A-4 528 748 there is also known a 
method for fabricating a printed circuit board 
with a desired three-dimensional shape, comprising the 
steps of: 
(a) providing a bendable rigid conductive substrate 
member having at least a first surface; (b) then completely fabricating a continuous flexible 
insulative layer upon substantially all of the substrate 
member first surface; (c) then completely forming a conductive pattern 
upon the free surface of the insulative layer; and (d) then lastly forming, without heating the substrate, 
insulative layer and conductive pattern combination 
to the desired three-dimensional shape with 
the substrate first surface being an interior surface 
of the shaped board and without damaging or reducing 
the continuity of the insulative layer, 
formed in step (b) and conductive pattern thereon. From US-A-4 922 059 there is further known an 
origami printed circuit board comprising a rigid 
printed circuit board having a flexible conducting back 
secured to the bottom of the circuit board. 
The circuit 
board is then grooved in a predetermined manner with 
the grooves extending through the rigid circuit board, 
but not extending into
