<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to capacity modulation of compressors
and more particularly to capacity modulation of scroll-type compressors.Capacity modulation is often a desirable feature to incorporate in air
conditioning and refrigeration compressors in order to better accommodate the wide
range of loading to which the systems may be subjected. Many different approaches
have been utilized for providing this capacity modulation feature ranging from
controlling of the suction inlet to bypassing discharge gas back to the suction inlet.
With scroll-type compressors, capacity modulation has often been accomplished via
a delayed suction approach which comprises providing ports at various positions
which, when opened, allow the compression chambers formed between the
intermeshing scroll wraps to communicate with the suction gas supply thereby
delaying the point at which compression of the suction gas begins. This method of
capacity modulation actually reduces the compression ratio of the compressor. While
such systems are effective at reducing the capacity of the compressor, they are only
able to provide a predetermined amount of compressor unloading, the amount of
unloading being dependent upon the positioning of the unloading ports along the
wraps. While it is possible to provide multiple step unloading by incorporating a
plurality of such ports at different locations, this approach becomes costly and
requires additional space to accommodate the separate controls for opening and
closing each set of ports.WO 86/01262 upon which the precharacterizing portion of
appended claim 1 is based, describes a positive displacement
compressor or pump of the scroll type including first and second
scroll plates having convoluted interfitting vanes. The flanks of 
the vanes on scroll plates are interfitting and in sealing
contact with one another and the tips of the vanes in sealing
contact with the other plate. One of the plates has a generally
central port and the assemblage is provided with a peripheral
port at the interface of the plates. A motor and linkage are
provided to cause the plates to undergo orbital movement
relative to each other and a selectivity operable mechanism is
operable to separate the plates to break sealing contact and
thereby unload the compressor or pump.The various embodiments of the present invention,
however, overcome deficiencies noted above in that-they
enable virtually a continuous range of unloading from 100
percent or full capacity down to virtually zero capacity
utilizing only a

first spiral wrap upstanding therefrom;
a second scroll member (702) having an end plate and a
second spiral wrap upstanding therefrom, said first and second

scroll members being positioned with said first and second
spiral wraps interleaved with each other;
a fixed support structure (700) for supporting said first
and second scroll members for relative orbital movement

therebetween whereby said first and second spiral wraps define
sealed moving fluid pockets which progressively decrease in size

as they move from a radially outer position to a radially inner

said first (704) and second (702) scroll members; and
a device including a force applying structure (714) to
effect relative movement between said first (704) and second
