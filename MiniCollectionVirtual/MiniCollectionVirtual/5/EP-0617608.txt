<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides for a dentifrice formulation comprising an antibacterially effect amount of a bacteriocin antibacterial agent and an orally acceptable carrier or excipient which composition does not contain an anionic surfactant. The present invention further comprises a method of reducing or preventing the formation of dental plaque, which method comprises applying an antiplaque effective amount of a composition according to the present invention to a patient in need thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to oral hygiene compositions and in particular to 
dentifrices comprising particular antibacterial agents which compositions 
are useful in antiplaque therapy. Oral hygiene compositions for use in antiplaque therapy generally 
comprise an antibacterial agent as the antiplaque agent. Antibacterial 
agents already used in various oral hygiene compositions include cationic 
antibacterial agents such as chlorhexidine digluconate and cetyl 
pyridinium chloride and non-cationic antibacterial agents such as 
triclosan. Another class of antibacterial agents are the bacteriocins. These have 
been defined as proteinaceous substances produced by bacteria and which 
have antibacterial activity only against species closely related to the 
species of origin. More recently it has been found that, at least in certain 
instances, the spectrum of antibacterial activity may in fact be broader. An example of a bacteriocin which has already found commercial 
application is nisin. This is a lanthocin, comprising the atypical amino 
acid lanthionine. Nisin is a polypeptide with antibacterial properties 
which is produced naturally by various strains of the bacterium 
Streptococcus lactis. It is also a naturally occurring preservative found in 
low concentration in milk and cheese. Nisin has recently been recognised 
by the FDA as a direct food ingredient. A summary of nisin's properties is 
to be found in Advances in Applied Microbiology 27 (1981), 85-123. Recently, a purified form of nisin has been made available by Applied 
Microbiology Inc under the trade name AMBICIN NÂ®. It has been 
suggested for use in a variety of applications including oral care, as 
disclosed in PCT Application WO 89/12399 to Blackburn et al., and now in 
issued US Patent No. 5,135,910 for use in the oral cavity, however the 
only specific disclosure of an oral hygiene product is as an oral rinse, for 
use as a broad spectrum disinfectant. US Patent 5,135,910 specifically 
includes in the formulations of the lanthione antibacterial agents the use 
of all surfactants, including those which are anionic.  
 However, it has now been found that the bactericidal activity of the bacteriocin 
derivatives, particularly nisin, is incompatabile with anionic surfactants. As far as we 
are aware, no specific proposals for a dentifrice formulation have been proposed which 
has recognized this particular problem. We have found that bacteriocin antibacterial agents such as nisin are incompatible 
with conventional dentifrices bases that

<CLAIMS>
A dentifrice comprising from 0.001 to 5.0% of an an antibacterial agent 
which consists essentially of a lanthocin antibacterial agent and an orally 

acceptable carrier or excipient which comprises an abrasive and does not 
have an anionic surfactant. 
A dentifrice as claimed in claim 1 in which the lanthocin antibacterial 
agent is nisin. 
A dentifrice as claimed in claim 2 in which the nisin is provided in a 
purified form. 
A dentifrice as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3 in which the orally 
acceptable carrier or excipient comprises a nonionic, a cationic or an 

amphoteric surfactant. 
A dentifrice as claimed in claim 4 in which the surfactant is a 
poloxamer. 
A dentifrice as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5 in which the orally 
acceptable carrier or excipient comprises a thickening agent selected from 

a nonionic thickening agent or a natural or synthetic gum or gum-like 
material. 
A dentifrice as claimed in claim 6 in which the thickening agent is 
hydroxypropyl methylcellulose or sodium carboxymethylcellulose. 
A dentifrice as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 7 in which the orally 
acceptable carrier or excipient comprises an abrasive selected from 

calcium carbonate, calcium phosphates, calcium pyrophosphate, insoluble 
sodium metaphosphate, sodium aluminosilicate, alumina, hydrated alumina, zinc 

orthophosphate, plastics particles and silica. 
A dentifrice as claimed in claim 8 in which the abrasive is silica. 
A dentifrice as claimed in claim 9 in which the silica abrasive is a 
"low anion" silica abrasive. 
A dentifrice as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 10 further 
comprising a fluoride ion source. 
A dentifrice as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 11 which has a pH in 
the range of 4.5 to 6.  

 
A dentifrice as defined in any of claims 1 to 12 for use in antiplaque 
therapy. 
The use of a lanthocin antibacterial agent and an orally acceptable 
carrier or excipient which does not have an anionic surfactant in the 

manufacture of a dentifrice for antiplaque therapy. 
A process for preparing a dentifrice as defined in any one of claims 1 
to 12 which process comprises admixing the ingredients thereof in the 

required proportions, in any order that is convenient and finally and if 
necessary adjusting the pH.
