<ABSTRACT>
A polyimide varnish which is a solution having a 
polyimide and/or a polyimide precursor dissolved in an 

organic solvent and which is useful for forming a 
polyimide coating film on a substrate by coating the 

solution on the substrate followed by heat treatment, 
wherein from 5 wt% to 60 wt% of the organic solvent is a 

polypropylene glycol derivative of the formula (I): 

wherein n is 1 or 2, and R is hydrogen, a C₁₋₄ alkyl 
group, a C₁₋₄ alkenyl group or a C₁₋₄ alkanoyl group.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polyimide varnish
useful for a liquid crystal alignment film.
More particularly, it relates to a polyimide varnish
which is a solution having a polyimide and/or a polyimide
precursor dissolved in an organic solvent and which is
useful for forming a smooth liquid crystal alignment film on a
substrate by coating the solution on the substrate
followed by heat treatment.By virtue of their characteristic high mechanical
strength, heat resistance and solvent resistance,
polyimides are widely used as protecting materials or
insulating materials in the electric and electronic
fields. Specifically, when they are used as insulating
films for semiconductors, they are usually used to form
polyimide coating films of from 1 µm to 10 µm on silicon
substrates having wirings applied thereto. When they are
used as liquid crystal alignment films, they are usually
used to form thin polyimide coating films on various
substrates, for example, to form polyimide coating films
of from 0.05 µm to 0.2 µm on transparent substrates 
provided with transparent electrodes. To form such a
polyimide coating film, it is common to coat on a
substrate a polyimide varnish obtained by dissolving a
polyimide or a polyimide precursor in a suitable organic
solvent, by a method such as spin coating, offset
printing or gravure printing, followed by heat treatment.When a polyimide coating film is formed on a
substrate, fluidity of the solution after coating is
important to form a smooth film, since the irregularities
on the coating film surface will be smoothed by the flow
of the solution.However, conventional solvents for polyimides usually
have a high surface tension, whereby the fluidity is
rather poor. Japanese Examined Patent Publication No.
81167/1992 proposes a method of incorporating butyl
cellosolve to lower the surface tension of the solution.
However, butyl cellosolve is not preferred from the
practical viewpoint, since its toxicity is pointed out.Under the circumstances, it is an object of the
present invention to provide a polyimide varnish which is
a solution of a polyimide and/or a polyimide precursor
and which is useful for forming a polyimide coating film
to be used
as a liquid crystal alignment film, by coating the
solution on a substrate, whereby a smooth polyimide
coating film can be formed. Thus, the present invention provides a polyimide
varnish useful for a liquid crystal alignment film which is a
solution having a polyimide and/or a polyimide precursor
dissolved in an organic solvent and
