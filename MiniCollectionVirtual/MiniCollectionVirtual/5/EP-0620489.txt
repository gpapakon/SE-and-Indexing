<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel coupler which is
used as a material for silver halide light-sensitive color
photographic materials. To be more specific, the present
invention relates to a novel photographic cyan dye-forming
coupler which is capable of forming a dye image with excellent
color reproduction property and improved durability against
heat and moisture.In general when a color photographic image is produced,
after giving an exposure to a silver halide light-sensitive
color photographic material, the color photographic material
undergoes color development. Then, in the exposed area,
oxidized aromatic primary amine color developing agent reacts
with a dye-forming coupler, to generate a dye and thus a color
image is formed. In this photographic process, color 
reproduction method using subtractive color system is used,
and thereby a color image consisting of yellow, magenta, and
cyan dye images is formed.Heretofore, as the photographic coupler used to form a
yellow dye image, for example, acyl acetanilide-type coupler
is known. As the coupler for forming a magenta dye image, for
instance, pyrazolone, pyrazolobenzimidazole, pyrazolo triazole
and indazolone-type couplers are known. And as for the
coupler for forming a cyan dye image, phenol or naphthol type
coupler is usually used. It is desirable that the dye image
obtained from these couplers is not changed or discolored
easily, even when it is exposed to light for a long time, or
when it is stored under high temperature and high humidity .However, up to now, in spite of extensive
research and development activity, the above-mentioned
phenol type coupler and naphthol type couplers are
still insufficient in respect of their spectral absorption
characteristics and durability against heat and moisture.
Various attempts and proposals, aimed at improving these
points, including making substitutions in the coupler
have been made, however a coupler which satisfies all these
requirements has not yet been found.EP-A-0 386 931 discloses cyan couplers which are based on phenyl
or naphthyl compounds which may be substituted with a
heterocyclic ring. There is no specific suggestion in the document
of substitution with a 3-substituted pyrazole ring.A photographic coupler, by which a dye image having
excellent spectral absorption characteristics and improved
durability against heat and moisture can be obtained, is
desired. The first object of the present invention is to provide a
novel photographic cyan dye-forming coupler which is used as a
material
