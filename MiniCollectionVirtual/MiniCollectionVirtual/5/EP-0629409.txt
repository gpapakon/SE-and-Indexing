<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and medical 
agents for the photodynamic diagnosis and photodynamic 
therapy of the arthritis, especially the arthritis of 
mammals. More particularly, the medical agents used in the 
present invention belong to specific fluorescent compounds 
having a tetrapyrrole skeletal structure. When an effective 
quantity of the medical agent is administered to an animal 
patient, the agent is accumulated in the affected part of 
the body. When light rays of necessary wavelength are 
applied to an affected joint to be diagnosed or treated, the 
agent generates fluorescence in the affected portion, 
thereby enabling the detection of arthritis. This is called 
as photodynamic diagnosis. In the therapeutic treatment, 
when light rays of appropriate wavelength and intensity are 
applied to a lesion, the agent is excited to produce a 
cytotoxic effect and the affected cells in arthritic lesion 
are necrosed. This is called as photodynamic therapy. The 
present invention relates to the diagnosis and the therapy 
of this kind applied to arthritis, especially rheumatoid 
arthritis.  Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic systemic disease 
mainly causing to occur polyarthritis as a cardinal symptom. 
This disease is initiated by the pain and swelling in small 
joints of hands and feet, or in elbow joints and knee 
joints, and other joints in whole body are then affected 
little by little. In the initial phase of the disease, the 
hyperplasia of the synovia of the affected joint begins by 
some stimulation of the unknown antigen, and the synovial 
hyperplasia is maintained and prolonged by the monokine 
cascade system to be a tumor-like condition. The constituents 
of the joint such as cartilage or ligament or bone are 
destroyed by the enzymes produced by these synovia and 
followed by the destruction of the joints. This pathological condition is observed in all 
human races and distributed all over the world. In the diagnosis of the rheumatoid arthritis, it 
is necessary to identify the outbreak of rheumatoid factor 
and the existence of inflammatory response by means of blood 
test, the occurrence of swelling and pain in joints, and 
further the existence of distortion of bones by means of 
X-ray inspection. In view of the results of these 
inspections, the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis can be 
attained. Since any satisfactory etiologic therapy for the 
rheumatoid arthritis has not been developed, the nosotropic  
 
treatment to preserve affected lesions is employed according 
to
