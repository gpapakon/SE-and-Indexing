<ABSTRACT>
The temperature of a heat reservoir (1) is varied according to a linear function 
which is AC modulated. At this time, the temperature difference between two points (9, 

11) located in a heat flow path going from the heat reservoir to an unknown sample (8) is 
measured. Also, the temperature difference between two points (10, 12) located in a 

heat flow path going from the heat reservoir to a reference sample (7) is measured. 
These two pairs of points are arranged symmetrically. Then, the resulting signals are 

demodulated, and each signal is divided into an AC component and a low-frequency 
component. Using these signals, the DSC signal is separated into a heat capacity 

component and a latent heat component.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a thermal analysis instrument which receives a
signal indicating changes in a physical or chemical property of an unknown sample and
measures the signal as a function of the unknown sample with respect to temperature or
time. In particular, the present invention relates to, but not exclusively to a differential
scanning calorimeter (DSC) in which the aforementioned measured signal takes the form
of a differential thermal flow between the unknown sample and a reference sample.U.S. Patent No. 5,224,775 discloses a method and apparatus for separating a
signal obtained from a heat flux DSC into a reversible component and an irreversible
component by subjecting linear temperature control of an unknown sample to AC
modulation. While ordinary DSC instruments control the temperature of an unknown
sample linearly, the present invention is directed especially to divide a DSC signal into a
component reflecting a reversible phenomenon and a component reflecting an irreversible
phenomenon. For this purpose, the sample temperature is AC modulated, and the
obtained signal is demodulated and analysed.On the other hand, an AC calorimeter measures minute temperature variations of
an unknown sample when minute thermal vibrations are given to the unknown sample,
and determines the heat capacity of the unknown sample according to the ratio between
the amplitude of the quantity of heat acting as a stimulus and the amplitude of the sample
temperature acting as a response. With respect to this AC calorimeter, the following
papers are known: Hatta et al., "Studies on Phase Transitions by AC Calorimetry,"
Japanese Journal of Applied Physics, Vol. 20, No. 11, 1981, pp. 1995-2011;
and Dixon
et al., "A differential AC Calorimeter for Biophysical Studies," Analytical Biochemistry,
Vol. 121, pp. 55-61.A DSC signal becomes a powerful tool when a physical or chemical change of an
unknown sample is analysed in relation to temperature. The DSC signals contain both 
information about the heat capacity of the unknown sample and information regarding
the latent heat. In one method, the specific heat of the unknown sample is found from
the DSC signal when no latent heat is present. In another known method, a baseline is
drawn empirically to remove the component reflecting the heat capacity of the unknown
sample from the DSC signal and thus the latent heat of the unknown sample is correctly
found. These and other known methods have enjoyed wide acceptance. However, when
