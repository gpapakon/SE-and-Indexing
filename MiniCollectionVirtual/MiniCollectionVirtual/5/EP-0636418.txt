<ABSTRACT>
A two-stage electrostatic filter for air recirculation units, 
comprising at least one ionization stage (100) formed by parallel 

facing walls in which is located a high-potential electrode (50), and 
at least one precipitation stage (200) formed by parallel walls of 

negative potential in relation to the ionization stage, in which such 
ionization and precipitation cells are comprised of at least one 

inverted "U-shaped" cathode (10) the opposite ends of which are 
mechanically and electrically integral with a transverse supporting 

section (20) and within which is provided at least one baffle (10b) 
extending parallel to outer arms (10a) of the "U" but with a height 

lower than that of the said arms and capable of cooperating with a U-shaped 
anode (30; 1030) counterposed thereto and rendered mechanically 

integral by means of insulated supports (40), there being also provided 
further cathodes (110b; 2110b) for the modular expansion of the filter 

in the direction of its width.

<DESCRIPTION>
The object of this invention is a two-stage electrostatic filter
particularly for air recirculation units, which is comprised of
extruded modular components capable of being linked mechanically and in
circuit to form a single filter body dimensioned for the required
volume of air to be filtered and a particle-collecting section capable
of being removed separately from the ionizing electrode.As is known, electrostatic filters for the filtration of air provide
for the passage of such air through an ionization zone or section,
comprising a high-potential polarizing electrode in which the suspended
solid particles are electrostatically charged, and for the passage of
such ionized particles via routes delimited by walls charged with
opposite sign to that of the particles, which are thereby attracted to
the said walls on which they settle in a stable manner.Such electrostatic filters may be substantially of two types: so-called
single-stage filters in which the ionization section and the collecting
section are combined in a single section, and so-called two-stage
filters in which the two sections are separated and placed in
succession to one another, each section having its own electric field.In both cases, the filter may be of single-body type, that is,
consisting of a single unit housing both sections, or of dual-body
type, that is, with the components comprising the two sections being
physically different and capable of being separated from one another.Within the field of two-stage filters there are known filters of both
single-body type (see DE-C-664834) and dual-body type (see JP-A-62110753) which,
however, have very limited
structural geometries and are difficult to adapt to the different 
filtering capacities required in different applications, in addition to
which their manufacture is extremely laborious and specialized, with
high costs of assembly of the parts.A further constraint of the filters of known type lies in the fact that
for normal washing operations it is necessary to remove the ionizing
electrode, thus increasing the risk of breakage, and in that a short-circuit
even in a limited zone would adversely affect the performance
of the entire filter which would effectively be fully short-circuited.There is therefore posed the technical problem of providing a two-stage
filter capable of being made from a minimum number of readily
assemblable parts and with a geometrical configuration capable of being
achieved and/or modified in a very simple manner in relation to the
specific requirements of
