<DESCRIPTION>
This invention deals with the adsorption 
method of the treatment of fibers. More specifically, 
it is pertinent to the adsorption treatment of fibers 
which enhances hand and shrinkage resistance to various 
fibers, in particular, animal fibers represented by 
sheep wool. Up to now, pants, suits, sweaters, etc. made 
of sheep wool have been required to be dry-cleaned, 
since sheep wool gradually forms felt and shrinks when 
washed with water. Because of this, development of 
sheep wool products which allow easy washing using 
water has been desired. Also, in order to dye the 
sheep wool used for these wool products, there is 
frequently used a method in which fiber treatment 
agents are added to the dyeing bath, and fibers are 
then subjected to the adsorption method. The 
adsorption method is the treatment method by which only 
silicone in the fiber treatment agents is adsorbed by 
fibers selectively, and in high concentration. 
Compared with the other treatment methods, such as pad 
roll process, such a method allows a high adsorption of 
silicone to the fibers, and therefore, the amount used 
can be reduced making it economical. In addition, 
there is less waste, and the treatment of the waste 
liquid is easy, and therefore, the method has been 
preferably used. Previously, the present inventors 
proposed, in JP-A 57-111354, an organopolysiloxane 
composition which consisted of amino group-containing 
organopolysiloxane, surfactant, esters such as organic 
titanate, organic zirconate, or organic germanate, 
organic acid such as carboxylic acid, and water, as the 
treating agent for the adsorption method. However, 
when animal fibers were subjected to the adsorption 
method using this composition, there was a drawback in  
 
that the hand of the treated fibers is stiff. Further, 
the present inventors proposed, in JP(Kokai) 4-119173, 
a fiber treatment agent composition, which consisted of 
amino group-containing organopolysiloxane, 
organosilane, colloidal silica, a catalyst for a 
condensation reaction, nonionic surfactant or cationic 
surfactant, and water, could give an excellent hand and 
shrinkage resistance to animal fibers. However, since 
this composition contains colloidal silica, it was not 
adsorbed to fibers, and therefore, it was not suitable 
for the adsorption method. In order to solve the above problems, the 
present inventors have made intensive studies, and 
reached the present invention. Namely, the objective 
of the present invention is to present an adsorption 
method for the
