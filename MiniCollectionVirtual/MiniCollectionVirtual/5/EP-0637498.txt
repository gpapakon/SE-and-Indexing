<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a T-shaped film 
extrusion die for use in forming films or sheets 
consisting of a synthetic resin, such as polyethylene, 
polypropylene and ethylene vinyl acetate, and more 
particularly to a T-shaped film extrusion die suitable, 
especially, for forming films or sheets out of a 
synthetic resin, such as polypropylene and ethylene 
vinyl acetate, without producing undesirable edge beads 
(unduly thick portions of a film produced at both edges 
thereof) and local thicker portions (non-uniform in 
thickness) which are encountered in a conventional film 
of such a resin. The prior methods for forming polyethylene or 
polypropylene into films include an inflation method 
and a method using a T-shaped film extrusion die. Out 
of these methods, the latter has been utilized to 
produce a fertilizer bag, a moisture-proof bag or the 
like by extrusion forming polyethylene or the like into 
a film, roll pressing the thus formed film while it is 
hot on a metal foil, cellophane paper, kraft paper or  
 
the like to make a laminate thereof. This prior method 
has been widely used for the production of a wrapping 
material for medicine and food and of various kinds of 
resin sheets as well. There have been proposed various experimental 
methods for producing suitable films efficiently by 
using such an T-shaped film extrusion die which has 
been later improved. These methods are illustrated in, 
for example, Japanese Utility Model Registration Nos. 
1726281, 1603083 and 1777587 and Japanese Patents Nos. 
1568629 and 1631933. All of these utility models and 
patents are owned by the applicant of the present 
application. In cases where the conventional T-shaped film 
extrusion dies disclosed in the above publications are 
used, films having high transparency are generally 
obtained, and, when a particular resin such as 
polyethylene is used, substantially satisfactory 
products which are uniform in thickness and free from 
edge beads are obtained. However, the synthetic resins used in a film 
forming method using a T-shaped film extrusion die have 
recently been greatly diversified, and, besides high-, 
intermediate- and low-density polyethylenes (PE) which 
have been conventionally used, various kinds of resins, 
such as polypropylene (PP), ethylene vinyl acetate 
(EVA), ionomer, LLDP, EVOH and EAA have come to be  
 
used. Further, since the properties of a resin will 
vary depending on a resin producing method such as an 
autoclave method or a tubular method, it can be said in 
thi

In a T-shaped film extrusion die for use in 
extrusion forming a film of a synthetic resin, 

comprising (1) a manifold for distributing a molten 
synthetic resin introduced into a die, in the 

lengthwise direction of said die, (2) a slot-like land 
through which said molten resin is passed from said 

manifold to lips having a discharge orifice 
therebetween, (3) the lips for controlling the 

thickness of a film to be obtained by regulating the 
width of said discharge orifice, (4) inner deckles 

which are provided in both end portions of said 
manifold and land, movable in the lengthwise direction 

of said die and adapted to restrict the width of a flow 
of said molten resin, and (5) inner deckle rods which 

are provided in said land at its both end portions 
located in the vicinity of said discharge orifice, 

movable in conjunction with said inner deckles and in 
parallel therewith, and used to control the width of 

the film to be obtained, 
   the T-shaped film extrusion die characterized in 

that heat pipes are provided on both sides of said 

manifold so as to extend in parallel with each other in 
the lengthwise direction of said T-shaped die, and at 

least a part of the outer side surface of each of said 
heat pipes is exposed to the interior of said manifold 

over the whole length thereof. 
A T-shaped film extrusion die according to 
Claim 1, wherein at least a part of the outer side 

surface of each of said heat pipes projects into the 
interior of said manifold, and each of said inner 

deckles is provided with a groove the cross-sectional 
shape of which is in conformity with that of said 

projecting part of the outer side surface of said heat 
pipe. 
A T-shaped film extrusion die according to 
Claim 1 or 2, wherein said land is also provided on 

both sides thereof with heat pipes extending in 
parallel with each other in the lengthwise direction of 

said T-shaped die, and at least a part of the outer 
side surface of each of said heat pipes is exposed to 

the interior said land over the whole length thereof. 
A T-shaped film extrusion die according to 
any one of Claims 1 - 3, wherein each of said inner 

deckles is divided into an upper inner deckle portion 
and a lower inner deckle portion, and a resin flow-control 

surface in its entirety of said upper inner 
deckle portion is inclined outward and downward with 

respect to the vertical axis of said T-shaped die. 
A T-shaped film extrusion die according to 
any one of Claims 1 - 4, wherein said inner deckles are 

provided with a recess through which a part of said 
molten resin is passed around and behind said inner
