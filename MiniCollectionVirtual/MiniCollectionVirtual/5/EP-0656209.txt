<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel medicament for
treating desynchronization disorders in mammals as well as
pharmaceutical formulations suitable therefor.Melatonin, represented by the structure below:

is named systematically as N-[2-(5-methoxy-3-indolyl)ethyl]-acetamide.
Trivial names for the compound include N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine
and N-acetyl-O-methylserotonin. Melatonin is
a pineal gland hormone which has ovulation inhibitory activity,
Chu etal., Endocrinology, 75, 238 (1964), as well as some
activity against MCF-7 human breast cancer cells, Blask etal.
J. Neural. Transm. [Supp.], 21, 433 (1986) and for the treatment
of mammalian breast carcinoma, Blask etal., Neuroendocrinol.
Lett., 9(2), 63 (1987). Furthermore, melatonin has been known
to expedite recovery from "jet lag syndrome", Arendt etal.,
Ergonomics,30, 1379 (1987), to cause sleep, Waldhauser etal., 
Psychopharmacology, 100, 222 (1990) and to minimize disturbances
in circadian rhythms of bodily performance and function, U.S.
Patent Nos. 4,600,723 and 5,242,941.Several melatonin analogues of the formula

wherein
   R1 is hydrogen, C1-C4 alkyl or C1-C4 alkoxy;
   R2 is hydrogen or C1-C4 alkyl;
   R3 is hydrogen or methyl;
   R4 is hydrogen, haloacetyl, C1-C5 alkanoyl, benzoyl or
benzoyl substituted with halo or methyl;
   R5 and R6 are individually hydrogen or halo; and
   R7 is hydrogen or C1-C4 alkyl;
   provided that when R2 is hydrogen, at least one of R5
and R6 is halo, have also been prepared and shown to possess
ovulation inhibition activity (see U.S. Patent Nos. 4,997,845
and 4,614,807). Such analogues are also stated to be active in
treating hormonally dependent breast carcinomas in U.S. Patent
No. 5,196,435.Melatonin analogues are disclosed in EP-A-0 578
620, and 6-chloromelatonin in Brain Research, 495 (2),
1989, 349-354 and Chronobiologia, 21 (1-2),
January-June 1994, 89-92.Finally, European Patent Application 513,702 discloses
that melatonin and its analogues of the formula
 
wherein R1 and R2 are the same or different and are hydrogen or
halogen can be used in treating sleep disorders and in pre-anesthetic
medication. Such disclosure does not teach or
suggest the use of melatonin analogues for treating
desynchronization disorders.It is our object to provide a new
medicament for treating desynchronization disorders by employing
certain known melatonin analogues. The instant medicament is
believed to provide a more efficacious (in terms of activity,
side effect profile and duration of action) means for treating
such
