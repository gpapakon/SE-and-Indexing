<ABSTRACT>
The invention describes an apparatus for treating parts of the body by vibrations, in which an electrodynamic vibration generator (10, 18, 14, 16) is surrounded by a housing (1, 5, 7). In order to achieve effective basal vibratory stimulation, especially for patients with very severe disabilities or hearing defects, it is envisaged that the vibration generator is arranged approximately in the centre of the housing designed as a piece of seating furniture and is equipped with a vibration amplifier (12, 40, 44).
