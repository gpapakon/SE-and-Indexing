<ABSTRACT>
A table-top coffee vending machine (10) providing
slide-out storage containers (30, 32) for easy filling and

removal, a compact fast acting coffee brewing system and a
filter paper cutting and storage system. A plurality of

storage containers (30, 32) for ground coffee, hot chocolate
ingredient and condiment are provided in a rack system that

allows the group of containers (30, 32) to be slid out of
the machine cabinet (12) on telescoping rails (36, 38) to

allow easy filling and removal of the containers (30, 32).
The brewing method includes simultaneously supplying water

and coffee grounds to a brewer, stopping the supply of both,
allowing the mixture to steep and then beginning to remove

the mixture from the brewer while reinitiating the supply of
water to the brewer for a sufficient time to supply a

complete cup of coffee at a cup station (20). The filter

paper cutter cuts lengths of paper (56) from a continuous
supply of filter paper (56) after it is used in the brewer

to filter the coffee. The cutter is saw-toothed and a paper
clamping mechanism is used to clamp the paper (56) in the

area where it is to be cut. The cut lengths of paper are
collected in a removable tray (18) and are compressed into

a stack by a sweeper bar (134) that is activated in
conjunction with the cutter action.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to table-top coffee vending
machines and more particularly to table-top coffee vending
machines that brew coffee by the cup.Table-top coffee vending machines need to be very compact
because of the space limitations, both vertically and
horizontally, that are usually present where such machines are
utilized. Additionally, such machines need to have
substantial capacity to vend many cups of coffee without the
need to be serviced, since the cost of service is a
substantial cost factor in the profitability of such machines.The present invention overcomes the difficulties and
disadvantages of prior art table-top coffee vending machines
by providing a machine that is compact and yet requires less
frequent service and is easier to service than other prior art
machines. These advantages are achieved by providing a table-top
coffee machine that utilizes easy to fill slide-out
coffee, hot chocolate and condiment storage compartments, a
compact fast acting coffee brewing system and a filter paper
cutting and storage system.In one aspect of the present invention, a table-top coffee
vending machine is provided having a housing, a brewing system
with a brewer, a hot chocolate mixing bowl, a hot chocolate and
coffee storage system comprising at least one storage container
having a removable top cap and a dispensing mechanism for
dispensing an ingredient therefrom at least one telescoping rail
supporting the at least one storage container for sliding 
movement between an operating position wherein the rail is in a
retracted position and the container is disposed within the
housing and the dispensing mechanism can be operated to supply
said ingredient, and a filling position wherein the rail is in
an extended position with the container disposed at least
partially outside the housing such that the cap can be removed
from the container for filling.In another aspect of the invention a table-top coffee
vending machine is provided having a housing, a brewing system
with a brewer, a hot chocolate mixing bowl, an ingredient and
coffee storage system comprising a pair of storage containers
having an opening in the top and a dispensing mechanism
associated therewith for dispensing ingredients from the
containers a pair of members mounted to the housing and
supporting the pair of containers for movement between an
operating position wherein the containers are disposed within the
housing and the dispensing mechanism can be operated to supply
said ingredients, and a filling position wherein the
