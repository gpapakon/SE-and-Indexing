<ABSTRACT>
Drum washing machine with a program progress control device and with a water-level regulated fresh-water inflow, in which, during the laundry-wetting phase in the first program part of the washing program, the fresh-water inflow is shut off via a level switch when the desired level is reached and is opened again for refilling when the switch-back level is reached. During the laundry-wetting phase, depending on the laundry filling quantity and/or the absorbancy of the laundry a time point tex excluding the further refilling of fresh water when the switch-back level is reached or fallen short of is set or determined respectively, in order to carry out the subsequent washing operation with a reduced free liquor.

<CLAIMS>
Drum washing machine with a programme cycle control device and water-level 
controlled fresh water supply, in which during the laundry dampening 

phase in the first part of the washing programme, when the reference level is 
reached, the fresh water supply to the lye container is switched off via a level 

switch, and when the switching-back level is reached, the switch is switched 
on again for refilling, wherein the length of the period between the reference 

level and reaching of the switching-back level in the lye container represents 
the measure of the absorbency of the laundry. characterised by the use of a 

fuzzy processor with fuzzy deduction device, to which during the laundry 
dampening phase measurements of the absorption speed of the laundry are 

fed and by means of this device. from these measurements. a point in time t
ex
 
is fixed or determined during the laundry dampening phase and this point in 

time t
ex
 is set before the last fresh water refilling operation.
