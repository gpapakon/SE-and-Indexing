<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to biodegradable
guide channels, processes for their preparation, and
methods for their use in various surgical applications,
specifically in the microsurgery of anatomical sites
where conditions of discontinuity and/or loss of
substance have occurred.Research to identify alternative surgical
techniques to treat, in particular, lesions to the
peripheral nerves and various parts of the anatomy where
conditions of discontinuity and/or loss of substance
have occurred, such as in tendon surgery, has been
described in the literature. Most of the studies
performed so far have specifically focused on the
treatment of trauma to the peripheral nerves, as
described in more detail infra. However, special
attention is now being paid to tendon surgery, for which
the use of gelatin tubes, cellophane, or polyethylene
structures, which give rise to rejection phenomena, have
already been described. More recently, materials 
composed of regenerated, oxidized cellulose have been
studied (Meislin R. J. et al., J. of Applied
Biomaterials 1, 13-19, 1990).A considerable part of such research has, however,
been focused on the use of guide channels or tubular
replacements for use as supports in the regeneration of
damaged nerves in the treatment of trauma to the
peripheral nerves.These tubular replacements allow the two severed
nerve ends to be held in proximity to each other, thus
enabling the nerve to regenerate under suitable
biological conditions. Moreover, these tubes inhibited
or delayed the effects of infiltration linked with the
connective tissue. Some guide channels or replacements
made for these purposes with various polymers or their
derivatives are already known (Ducker et al., Vol. 28,
J. Neurosurg., 582-587, 1968; Midgley et al., Vol. 19,
Surgical Forum, 519-528, 1968; Lundborg et al., Vol. 41,
J. Neuropath. in Exp. Neurol., 412-422, 1982; Molander
et al., Vol. 5, Muscle & Nerve, 54-58, 1982; Uzman et
al., Vol. 9, J. Neurosci. Res. 325- 338, 1983; Nyilas et
al., Vol. 29, Transactions Am. Soc. Artif. Internal
Organs, 307-313, 1983; and U.S. Patent 4,534,349, 1985).In order to increase functional recovery of the
damaged nerve, tubular replacements have been prepared
with biological polymers and mixtures of the same
traditionally used in nerve repair (Madison et al., Vol.
44, Brain Res., 325-334, 1985; Yannas et al., Vol. 11,
Trans. soc. Biomat. 146, 1985; Williams et al., Vol.
264, J. Comp. Neurol. 284-290, 1987). The possibility of
including various growth factors in these tubular
