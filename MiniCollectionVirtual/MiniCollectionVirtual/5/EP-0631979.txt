<ABSTRACT>
Uniform, free-flowing, non-friable P₂S₅ granules having a 
predetermined reactivity can be produced by accretion by 

spraying molten P₂S₅ onto cascading, smaller solid particles 
of P₂S₅. The process can be used to produce any reactivity 

grade of P₂S₅ by adjusting processing conditions. The process 
can also be used to produce P₂S₅ in a form suitable for bulk 

shipping.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the solidification of 
phosphorus pentasulfide by an accretion-type granulation 
process in order to produce a free-flowing, non-friable 
product with selective, consistent reactivity. Accretion-type granulation has been successfully utilized 
in the production of fertilizers and pharmaceutical products. 
Accretion granulation is generally conducted by increasing the 
size of small seed particles through the gradual external 
addition by coating or fusion of like material in the form of 
concentrated solutions and/or melts. The granulation process 
normally utilizes a rotating drum or pan which is designed to 
form a cascading bed or curtain of undersized seed particles 
onto which a solution or molten material is sprayed. The 
important characteristics of a multiple-layered accreted 
granule are its high hardness, high sphericity, and resistance 
to form dust.  In U.S. Pat. No. 4,686,115, Majer, improving upon the 
layering-type granulation process for fertilizers, 
acknowledges that accretion granulation produces higher 
hardness, lower tendency to powder, lower tendency to being 
crushed, and higher sphericity than other granulation methods. 
In U.S. Pat. No. 4,842,790, Nunnelly describes an improved 
accretion process that further increases the strength or 
hardness of the granule and also further decreases its 
friability. The purpose of Nunnelly's invention is the 
prevention of fracturing and dust formation and thus the 
improvement of the bulk handling characteristics. It is known that granulated fertilizers can be produced 
by accretion granulation which are free-flowing, anti-caking, 
non-friable, etc. It is also known that a dustless, granular 
product will readily mix with a liquid whereas dust and small 
particles tend to float on the top of the liquid. Granulation by accretion has never before been used in 
the production of P₂S₅, according to the prior art and as 
indicated by current industry technology. Prior solidification methods for P₂S₅ consist of bulk 
casting, water-cooled screw granulation, and rotary drum 
flaking. The latter two methods are followed by milling as 
part of the production process whereas the cast material is 
generally milled at the user's facility. The rate of cooling 
P₂S₅ during the solidification step directly affects the 
product's crystalline (or amorphous) structure, and thus  
 
affects its reactivity. Commercial P₂S₅ is characterized by 
the rate at which it will react with alcohols to produce 
dialkyl thiophosphoric

A process for the granulation of phosphorus pentasulfide 
(P₂S₅) yielding a product of predetermined reactivity 

comprising spraying molten P₂S₅ onto an active mass of 
particles which is solid P₂S₅ or a combination of solid P₂S₅ and 

an inert material. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 characterized in that the 
temperature of the molten P₂S₅ spray ranges between about 280°C 

and about 420°C and the temperature of the active mass of 
particles ranges from about 65°C and about 160°C. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 characterized 
in that the ratio of the median volume diameter of the molten 

spray droplets to the mean particle diameter of the active mass 
of P₂S₅ ranges from about 0.8 to about 0.35. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1-3 characterized 
in that the initial bed of P₂S₅ solid particles is formed of 

particles having a particle size from about 800 to about 2500 
microns smaller than the desired final product particle size. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1-4 characterized 
in that the active mass of particles is formed by a cascading 

bed or a falling curtain of P₂S₅ particles or a combination 
thereof. 
A process as claimed in claim 5 characterized in that a 
rotating drum having interior lifting courses lifts the P₂S₅ 

particles and creates the cascading bed or falling curtain of 
particles. 
A process as claimed in claim 5 or claim 6 characterized 
in that the temperature of the cascading/falling particles is 

controlled by removing absorbed heat with a flowing, inert gas. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1-7 characterized 
in that the reactivity of the P₂S₅ is predetermined by the 

variation of the temperature of the molten spray, the 
temperature of the cascading/falling particles, the median 

particle diameter of the molten spray, the median particle 
diameter of the cascading/falling particles, or any combination 

of these parameters. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1-8 characterized 
in that the product obtained has a reactivity within the range 

of from about 1.0 to about 12°C/min. 
Uniform, free-flowing, non-friable P₂S₅ granules having a
