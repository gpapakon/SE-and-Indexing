<ABSTRACT>
The star conveyor (1) can easily and rapidly be 
adapted to differently-shaped containers (3) 

thanks to the presence of an adjustment device 
constituted by two discs (11a and 11b), one 

superposed on another. The discs (11a and 11b) are 
provided with compartments (4) for receiving 

containers (3): a lever mechanism (18) 
kinematically connects the discs (11a and 11b) and 

prevents and/or permits the discs (11a and 11b) to 
rotate reciprocally, increasing or reducing the 

compartment (4) diameter.

<DESCRIPTION>
The prior art comprises star conveyors having a 
rotating body provided at its perimeter with a 
plurality of compartments for receiving and then 
transporting containers, said containers being 
externally steadied by a guide preventing them 
from falling off the conveyor. When the type of 
container to be filled is changed, then it is also 
necessary to change the compartment shape and the 
guide: this has been obviated by recent 
improvements in the field. DE 3143511 teaches an adjustable star conveyor, 
provided with "scissor" type transporter elements 
which are able to adapt to containers having 
different diameters. The scissor elements are 
activated by a rather complex mechanism, however. The above-mentioned document also comprises a 
further embodiment based on the use of a plurality 
of rotating plates having more than one work 
position. Each of the positions exhibits a chamber 
for transporting a container of a predetermined  
 
diameter. Obviously this leads to difficulties in 
the adjustment of all of the plates if the 
container shape is to be changed. European Patent Applications EP 0 355 971 and EP 0 
412 059 both refer (though with different 
embodiment modalities) to transfer stars provided 
with a plurality of pushing elements which adapt 
themselves to different containers, and also with 
an adjustable external guide. The pushing 
elements, however, are activated by somewhat 
complicated mechanisms and what is more, in the 
case of EP 0 355 971, there are problems 
associated with transport precision inasmuch as 
differently-shaped containers are not moved on the 
same line, leading to the need for the star 
conveyor to be laterally displaced in order for 
the containers to be correctly oriented for entry 
into bottle filler machines, which require 
considerable precision. JP 61-211220 teaches a star conveyor comprising 
two superposed plates equipped with compartments, 
the plates being able to rotate with respect to 
each other in order to change the aperture of the 
part where the bottles are gripped by the neck. The above device needs special staffs to bring the  
 
lower plate up to the same level as the upper 
plate in the gripping zone: furthermore, the 
adjustment mechanism for the two plates, in 
essence a bolt, is somewhat imprecise. A further drawback is that the body of the bottle 
rests on one only generatrix of the bottle, since 
the intermediate compartments for holding the body 
of the bottle are not adjustable and when the 
bottle format is changed the bottles are

<CLAIMS>
A star conveyor with an adjustment device for 
containers provided with a projecting neck and of 

different shapes, comprising: 

means for transporting a plurality of containers 
(3) separately transiting along a circumference 

arc of the conveyor (1); 
at least one pair of superposed discs (11a and 
11b), perimetrally provided with a plurality of 

compartments (4) and arranged at a level between a 
bottom (2) and the projecting neck (5) of a 

container (3), said compartments (4) being 
destined to receive and house single containers 

(3) to be transported, said discs (11a and 11b) 
being provided with means for connecting the discs 

(11a and 11b) kinematically one to another, said 
means being shaped in such a way to permit a 

reciprocal rotation of the discs (11a and 11b) 
during adjustment to modify a compartment 

aperture, and to prevent the reciprocal rotation 
of the discs (11a and 11b) during normal running 

conditions;  
 
an external guide of the containers (3), 
optionally provided with adjustment means for 

moving the guide into different positions 
according to a shape of the transiting containers 

(3),
 
characterised in that the means for kinematically 

connecting the superposed discs (11a and 11b) comprise: 

two slots (9a and 9b), one for each disc (11a 
and 11b), provided with racks (13a, 13b) on one 

side of each slot (9a or 9b) such that the rack 
(13a) associated to the slot (9a) in the upper 

disc (11a) and the rack (13b) associated to the 
lower disc (11b) are on opposite sides of a shaft 

(14) passing through the slots (9a and 9b); and 
a shaft (14) passing through the slots (9a and 
9b) and being provided with cog wheels (15a and 

15b) destined to mesh with the racks (13a and 
13b), such that when the shaft (14) rotates the 

discs (11a and 11b) also rotate about the common 

axis; 
in that a lever mechanism (18) is provided for activating or 
blocking a rotation of the shaft (14);  

 
and in that a further disc (10), concentric to the other 
discs (11a and 11b) and provided with the same 

number of compartments (4) as the discs (11a and 
11b), each of which compartments (4) supporting a 

container (3) by the projecting neck (5); 
A conveyor as in claim 1, characterised in that  
 

the lever mechanism (18) comprises: 

a sector (16) solid to the shaft (14); 
an element (19) conformed such that in one 
operative position it presses a plate (12) on to 

the sector (16), preventing the sector (16) from 
rotating, and in another operative position, in 

which it is upwardly pushed by a spring (6), it 
permits the sector (16) to rotate; 
a lever (7) for activating the element (19). 
A conveyor as in claim 1, characterised in that it  
 

comprises a second pair of superposed discs, 
situated at a distance from the first pair of 

discs (11a and 11b), and acting on a body of the 
transiting containers (3). 
A conveyor as in claim 1, wherein the shaft (14) 
is inserted in a sleeve (24) connected to a 

further disc element (10), or to a second pair of 
discs.
