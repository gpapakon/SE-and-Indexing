<ABSTRACT>
In order to hold a load in an open package (1C) comprising a base (10) intended to support the load (CH) and sides (11 to 14) having a height (HI) greater than that (HCH) of the load, the height (HCH) of the load (CH) is measured in order to deduce therefrom a lower height (HR) substantially equal to the measured height (HCH) of the load (CH), the sides are cut to the lower height (HR), the excess package (EX) located above the cut sides is removed and the cut package is closed over the cut sides and the load contained in the package. The lower package offers qualities of strength, stacking and presentation which are similar to those of the initial package.
