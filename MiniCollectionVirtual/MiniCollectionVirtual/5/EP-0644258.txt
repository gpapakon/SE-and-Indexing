<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to particulate bleaching 
compositions for laundry. Particulate laundry bleaching 
compositions are described which comprise percarbonate as 
the bleaching specie, said compositions being stable upon 
manufacture and storage. The inorganic perhydrate bleach most widely used in the 
context of laundry bleaching is sodium perborate in the 
form of either the monohydrate or tetrahydrate. However, 
concerns about the impact of boron salts on the environment 
have led to an increasing interest in other perhydrate 
salts, of which sodium percarbonate is the most readily 
available. Detergent compositions containing sodium percarbonate are 
known in the art, for instance in FR 2,385,837, US 
4,428,914 and GB 1,553,505. Percarbonate salts, 
particularly sodium percarbonate, are attractive 
perhydrates for use in detergent compositions because they 
dissolve readily in water, are weight efficient and, after 
giving up their available oxygen, provide a useful source 
of carbonate ions for detergency purposes. However, the inclusion of percarbonate salts in detergent 
compositions has been restricted hitherto by the relative  
 
instability of the bleach both as is and in use. Sodium 
percarbonate loses its available oxygen at a significant 
rate in the presence of ions or heavy metals such as iron, 
copper and manganese and also in the presence of moisture, 
these effects being accelerated at temperatures in excess 
of about 30°C. Moisture and heavy metal ions are unavoidable components of 
conventional granular laundry treatment compositions. Also 
percarbonate decomposition due to moisture becomes more of 
an issue during storage as laundry treatment products are 
often stored in humid environments when the product picks 
up moisture. This has resulted in marginally acceptable 
percarbonate bleach stability under Northern European 
summer conditions, where the average maximum temperature 
over the hottest months is from 21°C to 25°C, and 
unacceptable stability under temperatures higher than this. 
Such conditions are found in the Middle East and Southern 
Asia and also in Southern Europe where average maximum 
temperatures are in the 27°C to 33°C range for the hottest 
summer month. Such temperature accelerated percarbonate decomposition 
also occurs during the manufacture of the finished product. 
Indeed, as individual ingredients are mixed together the 
temperature of the mixture increases, accelerating the 
decomposition of the percarbonate. Furthermore, the 
temperature
