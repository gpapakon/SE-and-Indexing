<ABSTRACT>
An imaging arrangement comprising a multi-sensor for use in an x-ray 
examination apparatus is described that combines a plurality of partially overlapping 

sub-images, resulting in an increased effective sensor area when compared to a single 
sensor-image. Thus an imaging arrangement is provided suitable for imaging a large 

area output screen of an image intensifier by way of semiconductor image sensors. 
Image artifacts owing to variations in the alignment of the respective 
image sensors are corrected for by applying geometric transformation to respective 

electronic sub-image generated by the image sensors. The transformed electronic sub-images 
are assembled into a recombined image. Further image quality improvement is 

obtained by performing evening operations in overlapping regions of the transformed 
sub-images.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention pertains to an x-ray examination apparatus comprising an x-ray
source for producing an x-ray image by irradiating an object, radiation conversion means for
converting said x-ray image into a visible image, an imaging arrangement incorporating a plurality
of image sensors for converting sub-images in the form of parts of the visible image into
primary electronic sub-images and image processing means for producing a recombined electronic
image from said primary electronic sub-images.An x-ray examination apparatus of said kind is known from the US patent US 4
503 460.An x-ray examination apparatus as described in the cited reference comprises
multiple image conversion means in that a plurality of semiconductor image sensors and
optical coupling means having a plurality of lenses are provided for imaging respective
regions of an output screen of an x-ray image intensifier onto respective semiconductor image
sensors. Respective sub-images are detected by the semiconductor image sensors and image
assembling is carried out by an electronic circuit to produce a recombined image from the sub-images.
Only a limited number of errors in the recombined image are corrected together with
image reconstruction. The cited reference teaches only about correcting errors due to failing
photo-sensitive elements of the image sensors and about errors due to differences between
average sensitivities of different image sensors.It is inter alia an object of the invention to provide an x-ray examination
apparatus with an imaging arrangement having a plurality of image sensors provided with an
image processing arrangement for composing an image by assembling a plurality of sub-images
into a recombined image, that is substantially free of artifacts.An x-ray examination apparatus according to the invention is defined in the
independent Claim 1. Advantageous embodiments of an x-ray examination apparatus
according to the invention are defined in the dependent Claims. Differences in orientations of sub-images from which the recombined image is
assembled are an important cause of artifacts in a recombined image. Especially in medical
examination applications, artifacts are detrimental to the diagnostic value of the recombined
image. Such differences arise due to differences in orientation of respective image sensors,
notably charge-coupled devices when straightforwardly assembling sub-images into a
recombined image. Only to a minor extent such artifacts can be eliminated or avoided when
image processing is applied limitedly
