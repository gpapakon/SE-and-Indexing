<DESCRIPTION>
 Granulates for offset printingThe invention relates to granulates for offset printing and a method for their preparation.Compositions for offset printing, such as gumming solutions and developers, have previously been used as powder mixtures and aqueous preparations. However, powder mixtures can only be dispersed or dissolved slowly and clots tend to form. Furthermore, they are problematic to handle due to the dust nuisance. Aqueous preparations require expensive, ecologically damaging, watertight packing and, in addition, occupy a larger volume.The object underlying the invention is to prepare compositions for offset printing which can be dispersed or dissolved quickly and without the formation of clots and which only require modest, ecologically friendly packing. They should be free flowing, cause little dust and easy to dose.This object is achieved with the features of the patent claims.Granulates which are dispersible in water and methods for their preparation are known per se. EP-A-0 388 867 describes 

a method for preparing water-dispersible plant protective granulates, wherein active ingredient dispersions or solutions are directly granulated in fluid bed countercurrent granulating plants. However, such granulates are not known in offset printing and, thus, aqueous preparations and also powder mixtures are generally used.However, according to the invention compositions for offset printing can surprisingly also be granulated and the prepared granulates can be used for offset printing without them losing their important properties for offset printing. The instant granulates according to the invention are dispersible or soluble in water and can be used in particular in planographic printing as positive or negative developers and as rubber coating material (final treatment of offset printing formes) . The instant granulates according to the invention yield products which are easily wettable and dissolve very quickly and completely in water without clot formation. They are free flowing, cause little dust, are easy to dose and can be filled without difficulty into ecologically friendly packing, cardboard boxes, cardboard tubes, polyethylene bags and padded bottom bags of compound foil. There are no problems with disposal and obligations to return the packing material. Packing waste is instead reduced to a minimum on-site in the printing plants since the granulates can be transferred there into reusable containers. The granulates thus reduce transport weight as well as the transport and storage space
