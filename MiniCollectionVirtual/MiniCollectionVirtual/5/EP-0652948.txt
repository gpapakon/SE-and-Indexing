<ABSTRACT>
The keratin K1 vector for expression of a nucleic acid cassette in the epidermis. The vector has a 5' flanking region of the keratin K1 gene including a 5' flanking sequence, a keratin K1 promoter, 5' transcribed but untranslated region and a first intron and an intron/exon boundary, all in sequential and positional relationship for expression of a nucleic acid cassette. A 3' flanking region in the K1 keratin gene containing regulatory sequences including a 3' transcribed but untranslated region and contiguous noncoding DNA containing the transcriptional termination region. The 3' flanking region and a 5' flanking region are linked by a polylinker having a plurality of restriction endonuclease sites for the insertion of a nucleic acid cassette. The nucleic acid cassette encodes a sequence which can be used to express any protein, polypeptide or antisense RNA. The vector can be inserted both in vivo and ex vivo into epidermal cells. Further, it can be used for making transgenic animals or bioreactors of epidermal cells. The vector has been found useful for gene therapy in treatment of a variety of diseases including skin ulcers, wound healing, surgical incisions, psoriasis and cancer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention was partially supported by grants from the United
States government under HD25479, AI30283 and CA52607 awarded by the
National Institutes of Health. Further, this work was partially performed
at the National Institutes of Health in the Laboratory of Cellular
Carcinogenesis and Tumor Promotion, Division of Cancer Etiology,
National Cancer Institute. The government has certain rights in the
invention.The present invention relates to expression vectors for use in
expressing polypeptides in epidermal cells of transgenic animals. More
particularly it relates to vectors containing the K1 keratin gene promoter,
its 5' flanking region, its 5' transcribed but untranslated region, its first
intron and intron/exon boundary, its 3' transcribed but untranslated
region, its contiguous non-coding DNA containing the gene's natural
transcriptional termination region and its 3' flanking region.The ability to stably introduce genes into the germline of mice has
greatly enhanced prospects for the generation of animal models of human
diseases (Palmiter and Brinster, Ann. Rev. Genet., Vol. 20, pp. 465-499
(1986)). The need for such animal models is becoming increasingly
apparent as novel pharmaceuticals are developed which are specifically 
designed to inhibit expression of human viruses or counteract the effect
of mutated genes that occur in human diseases. Current efficacy
assessments of these new therapeutic agents are restricted to in vitro
models which do not allow evaluation of delivery routes nor assessment
of other factors known to affect disease processes in vivo, such as blood
supply, an intact immune system, humoral and cell-mediated growth
controls and physical barriers to disease progression. In addition, the
prospects for utilizing gene therapy to treat human disorders are coming
closer to reality. Therefore, animal models of human diseases would be
useful to assess the therapeutic potential of these approaches. The
epidermis is an attractive tissue for the development animal models since
it serves as a general model for other squamous epithelia and its
accessibility allows macroscopic observation of pathological events and
easy assessment of therapeutic potential. The development of a vector
which specifically targets gene expression to the epidermis of transgenic
animals is the subject of this invention.The epidermis is a continuously regenerating stratified squamous
epithelium. Differentiated epidermal cells are the progeny of proliferative
cells located in the basal cell layer and there is
