<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a process for cleaning a harmful 
gas which comprises bringing a gas containing an alkoxide 

compound such as tetraethoxysilane and trimethylphosphorous 
acid or a silane compound such as monosilane and disilane as 

a harmful component into contact with a cleaning agent 
comprising an alkali metal compound such as potassium 

hydroxide, sodium hydroxide and potassium oxide supported on 
a metallic oxide comprising cupric oxide and manganese 

dioxide as principal components. According to the above 
process, it is made possible to effectively and safely 

remove the harmful component in the gas exhausted from 
semiconductor manufacturing process in an emergency or in 

ordinary case irrespective of its concentration.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
cleaning a harmful gas. More particularly, it pertains to a
process for cleaning a harmful gas containing any of various
alkoxide compounds and silane compounds that are used in the
production step of liquid crystal or CVD step in
semiconductor manufacturing process.In detail, the present invention relates to a process
for cleaning a harmful gas which comprises bringing a gas
containing a harmful component into contact with a cleaning
agent which comprises an alkali metal compound supported on a
carrier to remove said harmful component from said harmful
gas.With the continuous development of semiconductor
industry accompanied by high degree of integration and
miniaturization of the related products, there has been a
steady rise in recent years in the amounts of alkoxide
compounds typified by tetraethoxysilane and silane compounds
typified by monosilane. In addition, pentaethoxytantalum
which is one of alkoxide compounds has brought into use in 
CVD step as a raw material for tantalum oxide film which is
employed for a semiconductor device from a new compound or
the like, for example, an interlaminar insulating film.Most of the above-mentioned alkoxide compounds and
silane compounds are highly toxic or unknown in toxicity and
are combustible.These alkoxide compounds and silane compounds have
made themselves indispensable as raw materials or doping 
gases in the production process for silicon-based
semiconductor and liquid crystal. At any rate it is
necessary to remove a harmful component in the gas after
being used in the semiconductor production process prior to
discharge in the atmosphere.As a process for cleaning a gaseous alkoxide
compound, gaseous silane compound or the like contained in
a gas, there are available two kinds of processes, one being
wet process in which harmful components are absorbed in an
absorbing solution composed principally of aqueous solution
of an acidic component by the use of a scrubber; and the
other being dry process which make use of activated carbon,
a porous adsorbent of inorganic compound type, metalic salt
supported on activated carbon, etc. (Japanese Patent
Application Laid-Open No.207426/1991)However, the above-mentioned wet process suffers the
disadvantages that when the equipment used therefor is
large-sized, it finds difficulty in post-treatment, it
requires a considerable expense in the maintenance of the
equipment and further that the absorption efficiency is not
necessarily high, thereby making it impossible to
