<ABSTRACT>
A method to induce or enhance an erection or treat erectile dysfunction through the administration of a pyridylguanidine compound, preferably, N-cyano-N' (1,1-dimethyl propyl)-N''-3-pyridinyl guanidine, in low doses to the penis. Administration can be by injection into the corpus cavernosum of the penis or trandermal application.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed toward the administration of a pyridylguanidine 
compound, 
to the corpus cavernosum of the penis to cause or enhance an erection. Impotency is a recognized clinical problem which affects approximately ten million men 
in the United States alone. This condition is due to neurological, vascular, endocrine or 
psychogenic pathologies that prevent an erectile response. Normally, erection involves a 
complex and incompletely understood mechanism by which neural stimuli induces relaxation of 
the penile arteries and sinusoids causing pooling of blood in the corpus cavernosum, subsequent 
compression of venous drainage increases the pooling of blood in the cavernosum. Recently, the study of urology has recognized that male impotency or erectile 
dysfunction can be treated with medication in appropriate circumstances where the dysfunction 
is physiological. In such situations, an erection may be induced or enhanced by the 
administration of a vasodilator in the immediate vicinity of the corpus cavernosum. This 
treatment was reported in the U.S. Patent 4,127,118 as a method for alleviating and treating 
male impotence by injecting into the penis an effective amount of vasodilator, a 
sympathomimetic amine or an andronergic blocking agent. Since this time, numerous articles have been authored which describe the effects of 
vasodilators or antihypertensives to treat erectile dysfunction. Various drugs known to be useful 
for injection therapy are papaverine, which dilates blood vessels and is sometimes combined 
with phentolamine as a reinforcing effect; and prostaglandin E1. A small, insulin-type syringe is 
used to inject the drug directly into the tissue of the penis. The basic action of the drug is to 
dilate blood vessels in the penis allowing them to fill with blood. While the use of some drugs are known, the search for faster acting or more effective 
drugs are constantly being sought. Better drugs are sought to minimize injection dosages or 
avoid injection and, instead, provide a topical treatment. The following articles all disclose the use of pinacidil as a vasodilator in the treatment 
of male impotence: Holmquist, et al., Effects of Pinacidil on related human corpus cavernosum 
penis, Acta Phys Scand 138:463-469 (1990); Giraldi, et al., Effects of Pinacidil upon penile 
erectile tissue, in vitro and in vivo, Pharmacology & Toxicology 67:235-238 (1990); and 
Holmquist, et al., K+ channel openers for relaxation of isolated penile erectile tissue from 
rabbit, J Urol
