<ABSTRACT>
An adapter (12) is of channel shape having longitudinal 
projections (25) at its respective sides for engagement with undercut 

grooves (24) in a face of a casing of a powered grinding tool (10) with 
which the adapter is intended to be fitter to sharpen high speed drill fits, 

in use, by means of a grinding wheel (20) of the tool. The adapter has a 
rearwardly directed head (76) at its top, the head having a rotatable dial 

(85) mounted therein which is provided with a multiplicity of differently 
sized drill bit receiving openings (87), so that, in use, by angularly 

moving the dial, the opening for a particular size of drill bit can be 
brought to a location where the drill bit can be inserted in the hole and 

correctly worked by the grinding wheel, when the adapted is fitted to the 
tool.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an adapter which is intended to be fitted
to a powered grinding tool, the tool being primarily for use in the
sharpening, smoothing, cutting, abrading, honing etc., of implements,
such as drill bits, scissors, knives, chisels, planar blades and the like.Whilst attachments for an electric drill are known which can
carry out one or more of the various operations referred to above, their
major disadvantage is of course that the drill cannot be used for its
intended purpose whilst the attachment is fitted.An object of the invention is to provide an adapter for a powered
grinding tool in an efficient and convenient manner.According to the invention there is provided an adapter for
releasable engagement with a powered grinding tool having a casing, a
motor adapted to be driven by power supply means, a rotatable shaft
drivable, in use, by the motor, and a rotatable grinding wheel to which
drive is transmitted in use, from said shaft, the adapter having engagement
means for it to be automatically secured to said casing at a work station of
the tool, in use, and to be removed therefrom subsequently, and defining
a location which, when the adapter is fitted to said tool at said work
station thereof, in use, provides for correct positioning between part of an
implement at said location and said grinding wheel for said part to be
worked by the wheel when it is driven, in use, a top portion of the adapter
being in the form of a head angled rearwardly relative to a lower portion,
said head having an opening at which said grinding wheel is disposed
when the adapter is secured to 
said casing at said work station, in use, and the head mounting a drill
bit positioning member for providing said location.The invention will now be described, by way of example, with
reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:
Figure 1 is an exploded, schematic perspective view showing a
powered grinding tool together with an adapter of the invention as well
as two other adapters, for use with and storage at the tool;Figure 2 is a front perspective view of the tool, with a grinding
wheel thereof not shown;Figure 3 is an exploded perspective view of the adapter of the
invention intended for use in sharpening high speed drill bits;Figure 4 is a top plan view of a base of a casing of the tool;Figure 5 is a side view of the casing base of Figure 4;Figure 6 is a front view of the casing, in a form different from
Figure 2;Figures 7 to 9 are respectively a rear view, a top view and a
side view of the casing;Figure 10

An adapter for releasable engagement with a powered grinding
tool having a casing, a motor adapted to be driven by power supply

means, a rotatable shaft drivable, in use, by the motor, and a rotatable
grinding wheel to which drive is transmitted in use, from said shaft, the

adapter having engagement means for it to be automatically secured to
said casing at a work station of the tool, in use, and to be removed

therefrom subsequently, and defining a location which, when the adapter
is fitted to said tool at said work station thereof, in use, provides for correct

positioning between part of an implement at said location and said
grinding wheel for said part to be worked by the wheel when it is driven,

in use, a top portion of the adapter being in the form of a head angled
rearwardly relative to a lower portion, said head having an opening at

which said grinding wheel is disposed when the adapter is secured to said
casing at said work station, in use, and the head mounting a drill bit

positioning member for providing said location.
An adapter as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the positioning
member is in the form of a rotatable dial mounted for angular movement

partly within a cylindrical chamber in the head, the dial having a
multiplicity of differently sized drill bit receiving openings therethrough,

each of which, by angular movement of the dial, can provide said location
so that, in use, with the adapter fitted to said tool at said work station a

drill bit at said location can be worked by the wheel.
An adapter as claimed in Claim 2, wherein the dial is releasably
held in each indexed position where a drill bit receiving opening is

correctly located relative to the wheel, in use. 
An adapter as claimed in Claim 3, wherein the dial is releasably
held in its indexed positions by part of a blade spring engaging in

respective grooves in the exterior surface of the dial, the spring being
between the dial and said head.
An adapter as claimed in any one of Claims 2 to 4, wherein at
least one drill bit receiving opening has opposed ridges therein to engage

opposed drill bit flutes.
An adapter as claimed in Claims 1 to 5, wherein said lower
portion extends from said location, the lower portion being of generally

channel shape having spaced sides and there being said engagement
means at said sides respectively to enable said adapter to be

automatically secured, in use, to said casing of the tool to retain the
adapter at said work station against lateral movement.
An adapter as claimed in Claim 6, wherein the lower portion of
the adapter has engagement means for releasable inter-engagement with

co-operating means at a base of the tool to prevent longitudinal
movement of the adapter when it is secured at said work station.
An adapter as claimed in Claim 6 or Claim 7, wherein said
means at its sides are projections for engagement with complementary

undercut slots at the casing respectively, or vice versa.
