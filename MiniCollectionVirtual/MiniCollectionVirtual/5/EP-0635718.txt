<ABSTRACT>
For the electrochemical measurement of the oxygen partial pressure in ionic melts, especially in oxidic glass melts, the use of a metal/metal oxide electrode as reference electrode is proposed. This electrode has the advantage that it is more stable with respect to mechanical and thermal loading than conventional zirconium dioxide electrodes and can furthermore be used more versatilely in the melt vessel.

<CLAIMS>
The use of a metal/metal oxide electrode having
a metallic electrode body which is coated with at least

one layer of a sparingly soluble oxide of said metal,
as a reference electrode for the electrochemical

determination of the oxygen partial pressure in ion
melts, in particular in oxidic glass melts, by

measuring the electromotoric force of the galvanic cell
Pt/Me/Me oxide/melt/Pt.
The use according to Claim 1,

characterized in that

the oxide layer on the electrode body is not formed
until the the electrode is immersed in the melt.
The use according to Claim 1 or 2,

characterized in that

the electrode (7) is made of Mo/MoO
2
, W/WO
2
, Hf/HfO
2
,
Nb/NbO, or Ta/Ta
2
O
5
 or of alloys of the said metals with
one another and their mixed oxides.
The use according to at least one of Claims 1

to 3,

characterized in that

the electrode (7) is in the form of a rod or of a tube
sealed at one end.
The use according to at least one of Claims 1
to 4,

characterized in that

a thermocouple is disposed in the interior of the
electrode (7). 
The use according to at least one of Claims 1
to 5,

characterized in that

that portion of the electrode (7) which is not immersed
in the melt is surrounded by a sleeve (8) into which an

inert gas can be fed.
