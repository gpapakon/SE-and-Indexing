<DESCRIPTION>
This application claims the benefit of Japanese Application No. 09-064489, filed in Japan
on March 18, 1997, which is hereby incorporated by reference.This application hereby incorporates by reference Japanese Application No. 08-153769,
filed in Japan on June 14, 1996.The present invention relates to an apparatus that uses light with a wavelength of 300 nm
or less as a light source. Such an apparatus includes an image-focusing optical system that can
be installed in various apparatuses, such as an ArF excimer laser lithographic apparatus, ArF
excimer laser CVD apparatus, and ArF excimer laser machining apparatus, etc. The present
invention also relates to light-transmitting optical members, such as lenses, prisms and windows,
etc., which can be incorporated into these optical systems. The present invention further relates
to a projection exposure apparatus that uses light with a wavelength of 300 nm or less as a light
source, and more particularly, to a projection exposure apparatus that uses a ArF excimer laser
as a light source.Conventionally, reduction projection type exposure apparatuses known as "steppers" have
been used in photolithographic techniques in which fine patterns of integrated circuits are
exposed and transferred onto the surfaces of silicon wafers or the like. The optical systems of
such steppers are constructed of an illumination optical system for uniformly illuminating the
surface of a reticle (on which an integrated circuit pattern is drawn) with light from a light
source, and a projection optical system for projecting and transferring the integrated circuit 
pattern of the reticle onto the surface of the wafer with a reduction ratio of one-fifth of the reticle
pattern size, for example. Such apparatuses that use light to transfer integrated circuit patterns
onto the surfaces of wafers are collectively referred to as "photolithographic apparatuses". With
the increased integration of the LSI in recent years, a further increase in the resolution of the
transferred patterns on the wafer has become necessary. The resolution of the transfer pattern is
proportional to the inverse of the wavelength of the light from the light source and to the
numerical aperture of the projection optical lens system. Accordingly, a higher resolution can be
obtained by increasing the numerical aperture and/or shortening the wavelength of the light
source.However, due to various limitations imposed on the lens manufacture, it is difficult to
increase the numerical aperture of lenses. Accordingly, the
