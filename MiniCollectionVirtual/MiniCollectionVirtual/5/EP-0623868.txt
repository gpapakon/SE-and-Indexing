Circuit arrangement for monitoring the supply
voltage (Vs) of a processor unit (1), which is clocked

by an oscillator (2) and requires a minimum supply
voltage,
characterized

in that
, in the event of a supply voltage (Vs) in the
range between a low first limit value and a second

limit value, which lies above the latter but below the
minimum supply voltage, an undervoltage detector (3) is

in operation and generates a reset signal (Rs) in this
case,
in that
, in the event of a supply voltage (Vs) above
the second limit value, a comparator (4) is in

operation, which, in the event of a supply voltage (Vs)
above a third limit value, which lies above the minimum

supply voltage, generates an activation signal (As),
and in that the oscillator (2) is in operation in the

event of a supply voltage (Vs) above the second limit
value and the processor unit (1) is in operation in the

event of the occurrence of the activation signal (As).
Circuit arrangement according to Claim 1,
characterized

in that
, in the event of a supply voltage (Vs) above
the second limit value, the comparator (2) is in

operation only when an additional enable signal (Fs)
occurs.
Circuit arrangement according to Claim 2,
characterized

in that
, in the event of the occurrence of a start
signal (Ss) fed in externally, a first storage element

(7), which can be reset by the undervoltage detector
(3), accepts the output state of the comparator (4),

and in that an OR gate (8) forms the enable signal (Fs)
from the start signal (As) and the respective output 

state of the first storage element (7).
Circuit arrangement according to Claim 3,
characterized

in that
 the oscillator (2) has a switching input,
upstream of which is connected a second storage element

(10), which can be reset by the undervoltage detector
(3) and can be set by the set first storage element

(7), and in that the oscillator (2) is switched on in
the set state of the second storage element (10).
Circuit arrangement according to Claim 3 or 4,
characterized

in that
 first and/or second storage element (7, 10) can
additionally be reset by a reset signal (Er) fed in

externally.
Circuit arrangement according to one of Claims 1
to 5,
characterized

in that
, in the event of the occurrence of the reset
signal (Rs) and/or of the reset signal (Rs) fed in

externally, all the terminals of the processor unit (1)
are switched into a defined state.
Circuit arrangement according to one of Claims 3
to 6,
characterized

in that
 the processor unit (1) has access to the
content of first and/or second storage element (7, 10).
Circuit arrangement according to Claim 7,
characterized

in that
 the processor unit (1), in the event of a
supply voltage (Vs) above the minimum supply voltage,

monitors the supply voltage (Vs) itself by means of an
analogue-to-digital converter (17) and, in the event of

a supply voltage (Vs) above a fourth limit value, which
is greater than or equal to the third limit value, 

resets the first storage element (7), sets the second
storage element (10) and, in the event of a subsequent

fall in the supply voltage (Vs) below the fourth limit
value, sets the first storage element (7) again.
Circuit arrangement according to one of Claims 1
to 8,
characterized

in that
 means (18, 19, 20) are provided, which
permanently generate the external reset signal (Er)

with oscillator (2) switched off and which withdraw the
external reset signal (Er) in a time-delayed manner

after the switch-on of the oscillator (2).
