<ABSTRACT>
The antenna device has an antenna wire (1), a screening plate (2) and a housing which accommodates the antenna wire (1) and the screening plate (2), which housing is composed of a front part (3) and a rear part (4). The two housing parts (3, 4), together with the screening plate (2), form a sandwich structure on parts of their surface (sandwich areas (5, 6, 7)). The antenna wire (1) is arranged in the bend of a formed-out region (8) in the front housing part (3), which formed-out region (8) follows the course of the antenna wire and has an approximately V-shaped profile.

Antenna device for electronic product anti-theft systems with
an antenna wire (1), a screening plate (2) and a casing receiving

the antenna wire (1) and the screening plate (2) and which is assembled
from a front part (3) and a rear part (4), characterized in

that the two casing parts (3,4), together with the screening plate
(2), form a sandwich structure on parts of their surface (sandwich

surfaces (5,6,7)) and that the antenna wire (2) is placed in the
angle of an in profile approximately V-shaped portion (8) of the

front casing part (3) which follows the path thereof.
Antenna device according to claim 1, characterized in that
the two casing parts (3,4) marginally project somewhat over the

screening plate (2) and are interconnected there, preferably by
means of an ultrasonic welding joint (9).
Antenna device according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in
that the antenna wire (1) is in the form of several superimposed

loops and in that a window (10) is formed in the top loop through
corresponding recesses in the two casing parts (3,4) and in the

screening plate (2).
Antenna device according to claim 3, characterized in that
in the window opening is placed a transparent plastic disk (1) with

an integrated network of electrically conductive wires (12) and
namely with a preferably marginal overlap with the screening plate

(2).
Antenna device according to one of the claims 1 to 4, characterized
in that the antenna wire (1) is in the form of three superimposed

loops, that the front casing part (3) has within the bottom
loop and between two sandwich surfaces (6,7) a further portion,

which leads to a cavity (13) for receiving a transmitting or receiving
electronics (14) and in said portion is provided an opening 

closeable with a cover (15).
Antenna device according to claim 5, characterized in that
the screening plate (2) carries the transmitting or receiving electronics

(14) and that for fixing the transmitting or receiving
electronics (14) to the screening plate (2) there are retaining

means, particularly screw thread bolts (16).
Antenna device according to one of the claims 1 to 6, characterized
in that in at least one of the sandwich surfaces (5,6,7) are

provided holes (17) for the fastening screws or at least grid points
for the drilling of fastening screws.
Antenna device according to one of the claims 1 to 7, characterized
in that the lateral edges (19) of the screening plate (2) are

bent forwards at an obtuse angle and the front and rear casing parts
(3,4) are shaped in accordance with said bend in their marginal

area.
Antenna device according to one of the claims 1 to 8, characterized
in that a further antenna wire (20) is located in the angle

of a further in profile approximately V-shaped portion (21) of the
rear casing part (4) following the path thereof.
Antenna device according to one of the claims 1 or 3 to 7,
characterized in that the rear casing part is identical to the screening

plate.
