<ABSTRACT>
A fuel pumping apparatus for supplying fuel to an engine includes a 
pumping plunger 10 housed in a bore 11 one end of which connects 

with an outlet 12 and also by way of a valve 11 with a source 13 of fuel 
under pressure. Also provided is a further plunger 17 housed in a further 

bore 18 one end of which is connected to an accumulator volume 24. 
Cam means 22, 23 is provided to urge the further plunger towards the 

one end of its bore to compress the fluid in the accumulator and the 
outward movement of the further plunger under the action of the 

compressed fluid is transmitted to the pumping plunger to displace fuel 
through the outlet.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a fuel pumping apparatus for supplying fuel to
an internal combustion engine, the apparatus comprising a pumping
plunger movable in a bore, a valve controlled fuel inlet to the bore, an
outlet from the bore, the outlet in use being connected to an injection
nozzle of the associated engine and means for actuating the pumping
plunger.An apparatus is described in GB 2099078 in which a pumping plunger is
reciprocable within a bore under the action of a piston. The piston is
spring biased towards an accumulator. On applying fuel at high pressure
to the accumulator, the piston moves causing movement of the pumping
plunger. On connecting the accumulator to a low pressure source, the
piston returns under the action of the spring.The object of the invention is to provide an apparatus of the aforesaid
type in a simple and convenient form.According to the present invention there is provided a fuel pumping
apparatus for supplying fuel to an internal combustion engine comprising
a pumping plunger movable in a first bore, an outlet from one end of the
first bore, a valve through which fuel can flow into said one end of the
first bore and actuating means for moving the pumping plunger towards
said one end of the first bore to displace fuel through the outlet, said
actuating means comprises a further plunger housed in a further bore, an
accumulator volume connected to the inner end of the further bore, and
characterized by means operable to move the further plunger towards
said inner end of the further bore thereby to re-pressurise fluid contained 
in the accumulator volume and means coupling the plungers whereby
when the further plunger is allowed to move away from said inner end
of the further bore under the action of the fluid pressure in the
accumulator volume the pumping plunger will be moved inwardly
toward said one end of the first bore to displace fuel through the outlet.An example of an apparatus in accordance with the invention will now
be described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:-
Figure 1 is a diagrammatic drawing of the apparatus, andFigure 2 is a drawing similar to Figure 1 showing an actuating
mechanism for the apparatus shown in Figure 1.Referring to the drawings the apparatus comprises a pumping plunger 10
which is mounted in a bore 11 extending from which is an outlet
passage 12 which in use is connected to a fuel injection nozzle of the
associated engine or may be connected in turn to the injection nozzles
by means of a rotary distributor member not

<CLAIMS>
A fuel pumping apparatus for supplying fuel to an internal
combustion engine comprising a pumping plunger (10) movable in a first

bore (11), an outlet (12) from one end of the first bore, a valve (14)
through which fuel can flow into said one end of the first bore (11) and

actuating means (17, 24) for moving the pumping plunger towards said
one end of the first bore to displace fuel through the outlet, said

actuating means comprises a further plunger (17) housed in a further
bore (18), an accumulator volume (24) connected to the inner end of the

further bore (18), and characterized by means (22, 23) operable to move
the further plunger towards said inner end of the further bore (18)

thereby to re-pressurise fluid contained in the accumulator volume (24)
and means (19) coupling the plungers whereby when the further plunger

(17) is allowed to move away from said inner end of the further bore
(18) under the action of the fluid pressure in the accumulator volume

(24) the pumping plunger (10) will be moved inwardly toward said one
end of the first bore to displace fuel through the outlet.
A fuel pumping apparatus according to Claim 1, characterized
in that said further plunger (17) is larger in area than the pumping

plunger (10) and a non-return valve (25) interconnects the outlet (12)
with the accumulator volume (24), said non-return valve being

constructed so as to allow fuel to flow into said accumulator volume (24)
from the outlet (12).
A fuel pumping apparatus according to Claim 2, characterized
in that the means operable to move the further plunger (12) comprises a

cam (23) which is driven in synchronism with the associated engine. 
A fuel pumping apparatus according to Claim 3, characterized
in that the ends of the plungers (10, 17) remote from said ends of the

respective bores are presented to each other and interposed between the
presented ends is a pin (19) through which the movement of the further

plunger (17) is transmitted to the pumping plunger, said pin being
operable by said cam to move the further plunger towards said one end

of the further bore.
A fuel pumping apparatus according to Claim 4, characterized
in that said pin is mounted intermediate the ends of a lever (20) which is

pivoted at one end and at its other end carries a roller (22) engageable
with the cam (23).
A fuel pumping apparatus according to Claim 2, characterized
in that said valve (14) is located in a passage which connects said one

end of the first mentioned bore with a low pressure fuel supply pump
(13).
A fuel pumping apparatus according to Claim 5, characterized
by an adjustable stop (26, 27) operable to limit the movement of the

further plunger (17) away from said one end of the further cylinder.
A fuel pumping apparatus according to Claim 3, characterized
in that the ends of the plungers (10, 17) remote from said ends of the

respective bores are presented to each other and said cam is interposed
between the presented ends of the plungers but acts on said further

plunger (17) only, and a rod interconnecting the presented ends of the
plungers, said rod transmitting the movement of the further plunger away

from said end of its bore to the pumping plunger.
