<ABSTRACT>
A low-voltage output driving circuit capable of preventing the generation 
of leakage current. The circuit includes a transfer gate GT installed between the 

output S₂ of a first CMOS inverter INV
C1
 and the node S₁ at the gate of an MOS 
transistor PT₃ for active pull-up. At the same time, a reference voltage V
REF
 and a 
voltage level V
OUT
, which corresponds to the voltage level of the output line of the 
signal S
OUT
, are compared by a comparator CMP. When the voltage V
OUT
 is lower 
than the reference voltage V
REF
, the transfer gate GT is set to the ON state, and 
the output of the first CMOS inverter INV
C1
 is sent to the gate of the transistor 
PT₃ for active pull-up. The comparator CMP is installed so that when the 

voltage level V
OUT
 is higher than the reference voltage V
REF
, the output of the first 
CMOS inverter INV
C1
 is prevented from reaching the gate of the transistor PT₃ 
for active pull-up. Thus, although the input and output can take on any state, 

the generation of leakage current which flows toward the power supply from the 
output side can be prevented.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to a low-voltage output driving circuit to be
applied as an interface to a mixed voltage system.Recently, the demands of higher speed and lower power consumption for
digital electronic circuits to be adopted in a broad field have increased. A circuit
which can meet such demands to some degree has recently been realized by a
BiCMOS integrated circuit in which bipolar technology and CMOS technology
are combined.Also, a further large reduction in power consumption has been realized by
a low-voltage technology, and thus, a 3.3V power supply could be used instead of
a 5 V power supply.For this reason, for example, the realization of a low voltage output
driving circuit which can be applied to a mixed voltage system containing
equipment having respective power supplies of 5 V and 3.3 V is required, and some low-voltage output driving
circuits are suggested for this purpose.Figure 5 is a circuit diagram of a conventional low-voltage output driving
circuit which adopts this low-voltage technology.In Figure 5, 1 is a logic device. VCC represents a 3.3 V power supply
voltage, for instance. Q1-Q3 are npn bipolar transistors. NT1-NT3 are n channel
MOS transistors (hereinafter, referred to as NMOS transistors). PT1-PT3 are p
channel MOS transistors (hereinafter, referred to as PMOS transistors). D1 is a
diode.Also, the diode D1 can be a Schottky diode, for instance. The input signal SIN and the control signal CIN are input to the logic device
1. In the logic device 1, three output levels are controlled by the control signal
CIN. When this low-voltage output driving circuit functions as an ordinary
buffer, the input level of the signal SIN is output as is. When the outputs of the
low-voltage output driving circuit functions are in three state modes, which
includes a high impedance state, the first and second outputs are set to a low
level, and the third output is set to a high level.The base of the bipolar transistor Q1 is connected to the first output of the
logic device 1, and the collector of the transistor Q1 is connected to the cathode of the diode D1 and the
collector of the bipolar transistor Q2, and the emitter of the transistor Q1 is connected to the base of
the bipolar transistor Q2. The anode of the diode D1 is connected to the power
supply voltage VCC.The emitter of the bipolar transistor Q2 is connected to the drain of the
PMOS transistor PT3 and the NMOS transistor NT3 and to the collector of the
bipolar transistor Q3. At the same time, the emitter of the transistor Q2 is
