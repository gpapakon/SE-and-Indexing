<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to video signal processing techniques for
multimedia systems and, more particularly, to a method and apparatus for digitally
merging video data signals from multiple sources in a single display.Various techniques for displaying at least two different displays of information
on a video display have been disclosed in the art. Such techniques have been most
commonly disclosed in connection with the development of techniques for overlaying
information on a video display. For example, U.S. Patent No. US-A-4,682,297 discloses a
digital raster scan display system in which image data representing different images
is stored in separate memones. From each memory, the data is read out
simultaneously in streams synchronized with the raster scan. Each picture element
data group in one of the screens is compared with a reference data group. The
comparison output is used to select one or the other of the data streams for
transmission of the corresponding picture element data group to the display device.
One of the data streams is transparent at those picture elements corresponding to the
reference color, so that data from the other group is used to fill in only those picture
elements in the display.US Patent No. US-A-4,599,611 discloses a system for
combining video images from a video source with graphics
from a computer. The system includes a video subsystem 
for providing text and graphics signals, in a non-phase
modulated format, responsive to instructions from a CPU,
and a circuit for converting the video images to signals
in a non-phase modulated format if they are not already
in that format. A video switch has a first set of inputs
connected to receive the text and graphics signals, a
second set of inputs connected to receive non-phase
modulated video signals and a set of outputs connected to
either the first or the second set of inputs, pixel-by-pixel,
responsive to an attribute of the text and
graphics signals. A user input device, e.g. a keyboard,
is connected to the CPU for allowing a user to supply
information to the system and a display unit is also
provided.Furthermore, US Patent No. US-A-4,200,869 to Murayama et
al. discloses a system where an alphanumeric character
may be superimposed over a graphical character in a
manner such that the alphanumeric character may be read
but the graphical character, and thus the continuity of
the graphical display, is not destroyed. In the Murayama
et al., the output from the first and second display
generators are 
provided to an OR
