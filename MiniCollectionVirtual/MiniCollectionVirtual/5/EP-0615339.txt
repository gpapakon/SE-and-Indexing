<ABSTRACT>
A digital servo system includes a microcomputer (1) 
which controls the rotation of a cylinder motor (11) of a 

video tape recorder. The microcomputer (1) performs 
functions of a digital filter (6) which has a changeable 

transfer characteristic as a software. In response to 
detection that a phase-locked state of the cylinder motor 

(11) is continuously detected for a predetermined time 
period, a dynamic range of the digital filter unit (6) is 

made be gradually larger by changing a coefficient of the 
digital filter unit (6).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a digital servo
system. More specifically, the present invention relates
to a digital servo system which is provided with a
digital filter in a servo loop, and a video tape recorder
utilizing such a digital servo system.A digital servo system is used for control a
cylinder motor used in a video tape recorder, for
example. In the prior art, in order to make a servo gain
at a low frequency region in a normal state be high, in
general, a digital filter is inserted in a servo loop as
a lag filter.If the digital filter is inserted in the servo loop,
the servo gain at the low frequency region in the normal
state becomes high and thus resistance to disturbance
becomes strong; however, there occurs a problem that a
phase pull-in time a start of rotation, that is, a step
response becomes long.In order to solve such a problem, it can be
considered to utilize a technique wherein the digital 
filter is not inserted in the servo loop at the start of
rotation and the same is inserted after that the rotation
approaches the normal state; however, in such a case,
there is a further problem that discontinuity occurs in a
phase error signal and thus a control signal by which the
rotation of the rotation body is controlled, before and
after the insertion of the filter, and therefore,
variation or fluctuation occurs in rotation of the motor.Furthermore, it can be considered to adopt a digital
filter having a dynamic range by which the step response
and the resistance for the disturbance can be
respectively compromised; however, in such a case, there
is a further problem that it is impossible to give full
display the function of the digital filter as the lag
filter.US-A-4878165 discloses a digital servo system according to
the precharacterizing part of claim 1. In this system a
microprocessor performs a digital filter function based on
the output of a speed detector. The output of the speed
detector is used to calculate an error signal, which is
multiplied by a coefficient which is changed according to
the system requirements.On the other hand WO-91/06466 discloses a system for
reducing wave and wind induced roll motion of a ship. This
system includes an adaptive analog filter. Therefore, a principal object of the present
invention is to provide a novel digital servo system.Another object of the present invention is to
provide a digital servo system in which a phase pull-in
time at a start of rotation is short and resistance to
disturbance in a normal state is strong.Another object of the
