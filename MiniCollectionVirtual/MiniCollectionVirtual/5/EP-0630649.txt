<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a composition for the treatment of 
the pathological consequences of septic shock and related conditions. 
In its broadest aspect it relates to a composition for the treatment of 
the pathological consequences of systemic inflammatory response 
syndrome (SIRS). The invention also relates to the use of the 
composition in the treatment of the pathological consequences of SIRS 
and the use of the composition in the manufacture of a medicament for 
treatment of the pathological consequences of with SIRS. More 
specifically the invention relates to a composition comprising a 
preferential inhibitor of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) over 
constitutive nitric oxide synthase (cNOS), hereinafter known as 
preferential inhibitor of iNOS, and an anti-inflammatory agent or to 
the simultaneous, separate or sequential administration of the 
preferential inhibitor of iNOS and the anti-inflammatory agent as a 
treatment of the pathological consequences of SIRS. An example of a 
pathological consequence of SIRS is hypotension. Insults which can result in SIRS include, trauma, burns, 
allergic reaction, hypovolaemia, cytokine therapy, blunt trauma, 
pancreatitis and infection. When SIRS is the result of an infection, 
it is termed sepsis. The physiological changes associated with SIRS 
include a body temperature greater than 38°C, or less than 35.5°C, an 
increased heart rate, tachypnea and an alteration in white blood cell 
count. Animals with SIRS frequently become hypotensive. For example, 
sepsis frequently leads to severe sepsis which is, as defined by R Bone 
(Definitions for sepsis and organ failure and guidelines for the use of 
innovative therapies in sepsis. Chest 1992; 101, 1644-1655), sepsis 
associated with organ dysfunction, hypoperfusion abnormality or 
sepsis-induced hypotension. It has been established that over-production of nitric oxide 
is caused by iNOS, while cNOS is thought to play a role in normal blood 
pressure regulation. Over-production of nitric oxide is believed to 
contribute to the pathology of SIRS, e.g. hypotension associated with 
SIRS. Tests to identify preferential inhibitors of iNOS are  
 
described in international patent application WO 92/16666. Anti-inflammatory agents such as corticosteroids were once 
thought to be beneficial in the treatment of septic shock, an example 
of hypotension associated with SIRS. Pre-infection treatment with dexamethasone has been shown to 
prevent subsequent pathology, for example hypotension, when an animal 
is
