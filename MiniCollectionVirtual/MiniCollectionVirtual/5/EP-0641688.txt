<ABSTRACT>
An inflatable restraint system includes a 
diagnostic circuit (18) which measures the resistance 

of an external deployment path (12) containing a 
squib. The circuit (18) supplies a test current 

through the path (12) and measures the voltage across 
the path which is monitored by a microprocessor (36). 

A vehicle battery (22) supplies the power to the 
system and is connected to a constant current source 

(26) in series with the external path (12) to provide 
the test current. A current limiting device (42) 

between the external circuit and ground comprises a 
current sink (42) allowing a maximum safe current in 

the external circuit in the event of inadvertent 
application of battery voltage to the external circuit 

(12) and, during a normal resistance test, imposes 
only a small voltage drop on the test current circuit 

(18).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a diagnostic
circuit for a supplemental inflatable restraint
system.Supplemental inflatable restraints (SIR),
commonly known as air bags, are used in automotive
vehicles to cushion the driver or other occupant from
injury during an impact. Such systems include a
sensing and deployment module, a squib controlled by
the module to fire when an impact is sensed, an
inflatable bag, and an inflating device triggered by
the squib to inflate the bag. The squib is outside
the module in an external deployment path. The module
includes a diagnostic capability for checking or
monitoring the resistance of the external path,
thereby verifying that the squib is operational.A conventional diagnostic circuit for
measuring the resistance in the external path of a SIR
is shown in Figure 1. The external path 12 containing
the squib 14 is coupled by connectors 16 to the
sensing and deployment module 18 which includes the
diagnostic circuit 20. The diagnostic circuit is
supplied by the vehicle battery 22 and the voltage is
increased and regulated by a boost supply 24.A constant current source 26 is connected
from the boost supply 24 to one end of the external
path via a connector 16, while the other connector 16
connects the path 12 through a current limiting device
comprising resistor 28 and a transistor switch 30 to
ground. The inputs of a differential amplifier 32 are
connected to either end of the external path 12
adjacent the connectors 16 and the amplifier output is
fed through an A/D converter 34 and the resulting
digital data is fed to a microprocessor 36. The 
switch 30 is controlled directly or indirectly by the
microprocessor 36 via line 38.The circuit operates when the transistor
switch 30 is turned on, allowing the current output of
the constant current source 26 to pass through the
external path 12 to ground. The voltage developed
across the external path, which is indicative of the
integrity or fitness of the path, is amplified and
sampled by the microprocessor for analysis. The
current of the current source 26 is chosen to be small
enough, for example 150 mA, to impose no danger of
either firing the squib or heating it enough to cause
chemical deterioration.When the switch 30 is turned on for a test,
the fixed current flows through the external path 12
and the voltage generated across the path is
amplified, digitised and then assessed by the
microprocessor which is programmed to determine the
condition of the external path. The resistor 28 is of
the order of 100 ohms and is necessary
