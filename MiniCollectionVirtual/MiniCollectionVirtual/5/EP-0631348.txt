<ABSTRACT>
A releasably latching system is provided for an 
electrical connector assembly (10) which includes first and 

second connectors (12, 14). The first connector (12) has 
a front mating face (24) and a rear face (26). The second 

connector (14) has a front mating face (38) for interfacing 
with the front mating face of the first connector. A latch 

arm (32, 34) extends forwardly from the rear face of the 
first connector and includes a forward latch hook (32b, 

34b) for latching engagement with a latch shoulder (38, 50) 
associated with the second connector. An aperture (44, 58) 

is provided in the rear face of the first connector through 
the latch arm and into which a tool can be inserted in 

engagement with the latch arm to move the forward latch 
hook out of latching engagement with the latch shoulder 

associated with the second connector.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to the art of 
electrical connectors and, particularly, to a releasable 
latching system for an electrical connector assembly. Electrical connectors often are used in mating 
pairs or assemblies which include a male or plug connector 
mateable with a female or receptacle connector. Of course, 
a single connector often is used with a mating electrical 
device which may be part of a chassis, for instance. 
Electrical terminals are mounted within the connectors or 
mating devices for interconnection in mated condition. In 
some applications, the frictional engagement between the 
male and female connectors are relied upon for maintaining 
a secured relation of the connectors in their mated condition. However, frictional engagements between mating 
connectors usually are unsatisfactory when the connectors 
are used in various environments or applications where 
shock, vibration or acceleration can cause the connectors 
to separate, such as in appliances having vibrating motors 
or other components. Therefore, connectors have been 
designed for such applications to include various latching 
systems. In order to unmate the connectors, the latching 
systems most often are designed in one form or another so 
that they are releasable. One common type of releasable latching system 
incorporates one or more levers or latch arms which project 
from one connector into latching engagement with a second  
 
connector or connecting device. The connectors, 
themselves, most often include a dielectric housing, such 
as a unitarily molded plastic housing, and the levers or 
latch arms usually are molded as integral, flexible 
components projecting from the housing and snap-latchingly 
engageable with latch bosses or other portions on the 
mating connector. A typical releasable latching system has 
a latch arm located on an outside wall of one connector, 
with a hooked latch portion on a rearward distal end of the 
latch arm for engaging a latch boss or shoulder on the 
mating connector. By providing the latch arms alongside an 
outside wall of the connector, a compact package is 
provided, and the latch arm is releasable simply by pulling 
the arm outwardly of the connector housing to release its 
interengagement with the latch boss of the mating 
connector. Problems are encountered with releasable latching 
systems as described above, particularly the latch arm type 
systems, when the connectors are used in crowded 
environments. Often, there simply is insufficient room to 
gain access to

A releasable latching system for an 
electrical connector assembly (10) which includes a first 

connector (12) having a front mating face (24) and a rear 
face (26), a second connector (14) having a front mating 

face (28) for interfacing with the front mating face of the 
first connector, a latch arm (32, 34) extending forwardly 

from the rear face of the first connector and including a 
forward latch portion (32b, 34b) thereon for latching 

engagement with a complementary latch means (38, 50) 
associated with the second connector, wherein the 

improvement comprises an aperture (44, 58) in the rear face 
(26) of the first connector (12) through the latch arm and 

into which a tool (T) can be inserted in engagement with 
the latch arm (32, 34) to move the forward latch portion 

(32b, 34b) out of latching engagement with the latch means 
(38, 50) associated with the second connector (14). 
A releasable latching system as set forth in 
claim 1 wherein said latch arm (32, 34) is located 

generally on the outside of the first connector (12) and 
the latch portion thereon comprises an inwardly directed 

latch hook (32b, 34b), and said complementary latch means 
comprises a latch shoulder (38, 50) behind which the latch 

hook is engageable. 
A releasable latching system as set forth in 
claim 2 wherein said latch arm (32, 34) includes a tool-engaging 

cam portion (32d, 34d) located rearwardly of the 
latch hook. 
A releasable latching system as set forth in 
claim 3 wherein said cam portion (32d 34d) is directed 

inwardly and is located near the aperture (44, 58) in the 
rear face (26) of the first connector. 
A releasable latching system as set forth in 
claim 4 wherein said first connector (12) includes a molded 

dielectric housing (35) having the latch arm (32,34) molded 

integrally therewith. 
A releasable latching system as set forth in 
claim 5 wherein said latch arm (32, 34) is cantilevered 

about an integral hinge portion (32a, 34a) near the rear 
face (26) of the first connector. 
A releasable latching system for an 
electrical connector (12) which includes a dielectric 

housing (35) having a rear face (26) and an outer side wall 
(36) extending forwardly of the rear face, and a latch arm 

(32, 34) extending forwardly along the side wall and 
including a forward latch means (32b, 34b) for latching 

engagement with a complementary electrical device (14, 38, 
50), wherein the improvement comprises an aperture (44, 58) 

in the rear face of the connector through the latch arm and 
into which a tool (T) can be inserted in engagement with 

the latch arm to move the forward latch means (32b, 34b) 
out of engagement with the complementary electrical device.
