<ABSTRACT>
A gaming apparatus which comprises a slot machine (200) capable of accepting either paper currency, preprinted coupons, or cash out slips. The slot machine (200) also includes a printer (208) that prints and dispenses cash out slips which include a bar code representing a unique identification that provides the amount of ''winnings''. The cash out slips can be scanned into a separate currency dispenser at a cashier's station (300) for receiving currency, either from the dispenser or from an attendant. A central processing unit (100) generates the unique codes for regulating the game to be played, the wager limits of the game and the validity of the free play coupons or the cash out ticket. The above gaming system avoids having to use coins or tokens in the operation of slot machines.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a gaming system and a method of employing same.At the current time, gaming apparatus, including slot
machines, pin ball machines and other coin operated games,
typically use coins to operate the machines. The coins are
inserted in a slot in the gaming apparatus and the player
then operates the gaming apparatus based on the value of
the coins deposited. Some gaming apparatus, rather than
dispensing the players winnings after each play, store the
value of the winnings and indicate the remaining "credit"
of the player. When the player wishes to stop playing, the
coins are then dispensed into an external tray of the
gaming apparatus. While the present invention is described
in relationship to a slot machine, the term slot machine is
used to denote any gaming apparatus that receives money in
some form and pays out money or credits.In some instances, such as when the amount of the
winnings exceeds the stored coins within the slot machine,
an attendant is notified the additional payment is
necessary.The use of coins in the casino operation for the
playing of slot machines has presented a great number of
well-known problems that over the years casinos have
attempted to eliminate. These problems, among others, are:
(1) coins take up a lot of space and have to be frequently
emptied from the slot machine, requiring the play of the
slot machine to be interrupted; (2) a security guard is
required to be present, together with someone to physically
move the coins to a central location; (3) the coins then
have to be separated, counted, stored and rolled for reuse;
(4) coins are heavy and bulky. The amount collected in a
typical day at an average casino may weight more than two
tons; (5) coins are dirty; and (6) coins required to
operate slot machines represent an inventory (working
capital) need of several million dollars. Each of the
above tasks takes a substantial amount of time, resources, 
and costs money. The collecting, counting and depositing
of the coins may involve dozens of people.In addition to the problems with the physical collection
of the coins, there are additional problems
associated with the operation of slot machines which use
coins. The coins take up a lot of space within the slot
machines and the slot machines must be designed so as to
incorporate space for storing the coins. The use of coins
to play slot machines involves a great number of
transactions, including getting change for paper currency.
The requires numerous change attendants to constantly walk
around
