<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a baking improver 
composition in a homogeneous solid shaped form which 

comprises one or more baking improver agents and includes 
at least one binding agent which permits disintegration of 

the solid form when in use for mixing a dough. Such a 
composition form may be capable of manual division into 

smaller dosage units and obtained, for example, by 
compacting a powder composition based on flour and 

containing about 20 to 30% by weight of lecithin as a 
binding agent and baking emulsifier.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to baking improver
compositions in a homogeneous solid shaped form and
processes for the production of such formulations.It is generally accepted to add baking improvers to
wheat flour of the type used in baking or in biscuit-making,
in particular one or more compounds selected from ascorbic
acid, food enzymes, gluten and starch or lecithin, as
emulsifying agent, with a view to improving the performance
of the flour, e.g. the aptitude of the wheat flour to
dispersion and humidification, and the characteristics of
the dough and the final baked product. Such characteristics
include, for example, increasing the oven spring, provision
of a crust having a particularly appetizing appearance and
improvement of the bread crumb softness.EP 271735 discloses crispy granules or a dry free-flowing
powder comprising meal and an acid, produced by
extrusion (water and starch being the binder).US 3649304 discloses a solid shaped premix batter
which is ready to cook as such.US 1776721 discloses a composition in solid shaped
form comprising meal and lecithin as a binder. No connection
is made with the baking field nor baking compositions.GB 588354 discloses briquettes comprising a powder
(such as flour) and a binding agent (water), made by direct
compression at at least 100 bars. The briquettes do not have
the crumbliness of the present invention and are used as
foodstuffs.US 4762658 discloses a lecithin tablet comprising
lecithin, oil and moisture, made by compression at 2000 
lbs/in2 (136 atm). The tablet formed is used for oral
ingestion.DE 2530164 discloses a tablet comprising oil,
lecithin, protein and additive, made by mixing the
ingredients in the molten fat, forming a tablet by
compression and cooling it.EP 354442 discloses pharmaceutical tablets
comprising lecithin and palatinit (filler), made by shaping
the ingredients in the molten state and cooling the shape.
The tablets are intended for oral administration.EP 72469 discloses a solid pharmaceutical and/or
nutritional dosage form comprising lecithin, an active
substance and a filler, that is suitable for oral
administration.EP 619947 (Art. 54(3) EPC) discloses a compressed yeast composition with added processing aid.US 3753732 discloses a bakery enrichment wafer in
solid shaped form, made by compression of tablets. The wafer
will not chip, crack or powder upon ordinary handling.Processes for the production of baking aids in
powder form have previously been described, for example, in
French Patent no. 2,590,448-B1 filed by Jean Griveau,

</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A process for preparing a dough for a baked product which comprises
introducing a baking improver composition which comprises one or more baking

improver agents and at least one binding agent wherein said binding agent is
selected from edible oils, fats, emulsifiers, fat hydrolysis products and esters and

ethers thereof, water and combinations thereof and whereby the percentage of
weight of edible oils, fats, emulsifiers, fat hydrolysis products and esters and ethers

thereof is 40% by weight or lower or the percentage of water is 3 to 90% by weight, and which
permits disintegration of the solid form when in use for mixing of a dough, wherein

said baking improver composition is in an homogeneous solid shaped form, weighs
between 10 grams and 5 kilograms and has a crumbliness that is sufficient for

manual division by gentle pulling or bending by the fingers, but is strong enough not
to fall apart during packaging and transport, into a dough mixer with the other dough

components and mixing such that said solid shaped form disintegrates, whereby said
baking improver composition contains less than 2/3 kg of yeast per kg of baking

improver composition.
A process as claimed in claim 1 wherein said baking improver composition
is divided into smaller dosage units and one or more of said smaller dosage units are

introduced into the dough mixer.
A process as claimed in claim 1 wherein said binding agent is a gel derived
from an aqueous solution of a gel-forming material.
A process as claimed in claim 1 wherein said binding agent is selected
from edible oils, fats, emulsifiers, fat hydrolysis products and esters and ethers

thereof and combinations thereof is present at 5 to 30% by weight.
A process as claimed in claims 1 and 4 wherein lecithin is present as a
binding agent and baking emulsifier at 20 to 30% by weight. 
A process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5 whereby said baking
improver composition contains a filler material.
A process as claimed in claim 6 wherein said filler material is selected
from flours, starch and calcium and sodium salts.
A process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 7 wherein lecithin is
present at 20 to 30% by weight and flour or flour in combination with one or more

further baking improver agents is present at 70 to 80% by weight.
A process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 8, wherein said baking
improving composition weighs between 25 grams and 2 kg.
A process as claimed in claim 9, wherein said baking improving
composition weighs between 50 and 1000 grams.
A baking improver composition which comprises one or more baking
improver agents comprising a food enzyme, and at least one binding agent wherein

said binding agent is selected from edible oils, fats, emulsifiers, fat hydrolysis products
and esters and ethers thereof, water and combinations thereof and whereby the

percentage of weight of edible oils, fats, emulsifiers, fat hydrolysis products and
esters and ethers thereof is 40% by weight or lower or the percentage of water is 3 to 90% by weight,

and which permits disintegration of the solid form when in use for mixing of a
dough, wherein said baking improver composition is in an homogeneous solid shaped

form, weighs between 10 grams and 5 kilograms and has a crumbliness that is sufficient
for manual division by gentle pulling or bending by the fingers, but is strong

enough not to fall apart during packaging and transport and whereby said baking
improver composition contains less than 2/3 kg of yeast per kg of baking improver

composition.
