<ABSTRACT>
An image forming method includes steps of supplying a 
toner onto a surface of a toner carrier to form a toner 

pattern injected with static charge by controlling the toner 
mass and amount of the static charge using a toner supply 

control member disposed in abutment with the toner carrier 
and supplied with a voltage corresponding to an image 

information signal, transferring the toner pattern onto a 
conveying member by a first electric field formed between 

the toner carrier and the conveying member, transcribing by 
a second electric field the toner pattern on the conveying 

onto a sheet of plain paper transported by a transcribing 
belt, fixing the toner pattern to the sheet of plain paper 

to produce a fixed image thereon. The method is capable of 
forming an image on any paper at a low running cost and low 

costs of apparatus.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and an
apparatus for forming an image on a recording medium and,
more particularly, to a method and an apparatus for forming
an image on a recording medium such as plain paper, without
using a latent image forming member such as a light-sensitive
member and a magnetic drum.Conventional methods for forming an image on a
recording medium such as plain paper include a method in
which a material on a ribbon is thermally or mechanically
transferred onto a recording medium to form an image
thereon, a method in which a liquid printing material is
jetted for forming an image, and an electrophotographic
method in which a latent image forming member such as a
light-sensitive member, a dielectric, and a magnetic drum
are used, as well as a method utilizing printing technology.The conventional method utilizing a printing technology
as mentioned above requires many steps before reaching the 
printing step, and also requires an expensive printing
machine. Therefore, there are problems that each copy
becomes expensive in the case where the number of copies to
be printed out is small, and that it requires a prolonged
period of time to output copies.Further, the conventional method in which a printing
material in the shape of a ribbon or a liquid printing
material is used for forming an image has problems that its
printing speed is low and that a high print quality cannot
be obtained in terms of resolution and gradation.Although a sublimation method can be used, such a
method has a problem with respect to cost because it
requires a special paper. Further, the method utilizing a
latent image forming member as in an electrophotographic
method has problems that a process for outputting an image
is complicated and that stable operation is not obtained.
In addition, this method has problems that it requires many
components and that careful maintenance is needed for the
latent image forming member, resulting in a high printing
cost. EP-A-0407153 discloses an electrostatic printer which
forms images by selectively passing the charged toner
through the toner apertures by using a printhead having a
shutter, wherein the charged toner is carried by the
toner carrier. The selective passing of the toner,
however, is difficult in a digital control thereof
because of the distribution of the charge on the toner
and of the electric field on the shutter so that a stable
operation cannot be obtained.The apertures will be plugged and will not be readily
cleaned by electric means because of the
