 GLYCYL-HISTIDYL-LYSINE (GHK) DERIVATIVESThe present invention refers to Gly-His-Lys (GHL) peptide derivatives having cytostimulant an cytoprotective activity, to their therapeutic use as well as to pharmaceutical compositions containing them. The derivatives of the invention, together with improved therapeutic activities, are endowed with surprising resistance to hydrolytic enzymes.Many methods are known in medicine for woun management, including particular devices (from the anti-infective medicated plaster to the synthetic skin substitutes for burn patients) ointments, gels or other formulations for topical application containing for instance zinc derivatives.Recently, as a consequence of a deeper knowledge of the tissue repair mechanism and of the development of recombinant DNA techniques, different active principles have been prepared and studied, in order t promote and/or normalize the healing process and t heal tissue damages not otherwise curable (such as, fo instance, decubitus or diabetic ulcers) and to preven the formation of scars and cheloids: growth factors such as: bFGF, basic Fibroblas Growth Factor; EGF, epidermal growth factor; GH (also known as GHK), Plasma Copper-Binding Growt Factor, etc. ; components of the extracellular matrix such a fibronectin, collagens, etc..However, a number of reasons make the practica 

use of these derivatives difficult. They comprise the availability of the substance, the risk of transmission of viral or bacterial diseases, due to their origin, and, above all, their instability to enzymatic systems (such as proteases and peptidases: both i-ri vitro and in vivo), characterising most proteins, glycoproteins or peptide substances and providing the major obstacle to their use as drugs, particularly in the pathologies in which the protease activity is increased, such as in inflammatory conditions, both systemic and local.There is therefore the need for more stable active principles in the most different therapeutic fields.In the specific case of healing, attempts to this aim on complex proteins such as EGF, bFGF and collagens - obtained by recombinant DNA or extraction - turn out to be difficult and the few known examples are based on the use of topical galenical forms containing both inhibitors of serine protease and, as for EGF, competitive substrates such as collagen (see for instance K. Okumura et Al. - Phar . Res., 1_, 1289, 1990).As far as simple peptide molecules, such as Arg- Gly-Asp (RGD: known as the cellular adhesion site of fibronectin, laminin and
