<DESCRIPTION>
 POLYMER BLEND Background of the Invention The invention relates to cross-linked polymer blends including single-site initiated polyolefin resins and polyolefins including ethylene and propylene.Polymer blends that can be formed (i.e., thermoformed or pressure-formed) are useful in a number of applications, particularly, when the polymer blends have good flexibility properties, high thermal stability, and are foamable. For example, these materials can be used as components in floatation devices for water sports or as sealing or gasket components in, e.g., the automotive industry. Traditionally, the physical properties required by these types of applications suggest the use of high density foams.In general, polymer blends with these properties are based, in part, on cross-linked ethylene-propylene-diene monomer (EPDM) terpolymers or ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymers. These materials generally contain other additives, such as plasticizers, to add to their flexibility. Thermal stability is typically achieved by sulfur vulcanization of the compositions. However, plasticizers can leach out of the materials over time which can make the materials less flexible and the sulfur additives can make the material less desirable for environmental reasons.Summary of the Invention The invention features polymer blends which can be used both in foamed and unfoamed states as a replacement for conventional EPDM and other elastomers. The composition of the polymer blend includes a single-site catalyzed polyolefin resin having a density of below 0.878 g cm"3 and up to 40 weight percent of a polyolefin 

including ethylene and propylene. The polymer blend is cross-linked. The use of sulfur to vulcanize the polymer blend is not necessary.In one aspect, the invention features a polymer blend including a single-site initiated polyolefin resin having a density below 0.870 g cm"3 and up to 40 weight percent of a polyolefin that includes ethylene and propylene. A portion of the polymer blend is cross¬ linked. In addition, the polymer blend is formable. In preferred embodiments, the polymer blend is foamed.In another aspect, the invention features a method of making a cross-linked polymer blend including the steps of providing a polymer mixture including a single- site initiated polyolefin resin and up to 40 weight percent of a polyolefin including ethylene and propylene, and cross-linking the polymer mixture.In preferred embodiments, the step of cross¬ linking the polymer blend includes reacting the polymer blend with a
