<ABSTRACT>
It is known that, in addition to pulses with full bit widths, pulses with half bit widths occur in CMI-coded signals so that the phase discriminator for the clock generation must operate at twice the bit repetition rate and the associated binary clock can be produced with a phase error of 180@. In accordance with the invention, a phase discriminator of a D-type flip flop and an OR gate is given which, in order to reduce the pattern-dependency of the phase locked loop can be extended by a further D-type flip flop and a further OR gate. A third D-type flip flop with a CMI/binary converter can be connected in series in a simple manner for the CMI/binary conversion.

Phase discriminator for CMI-coded signals, in
particular for use in a phase-locked loop,

characterized

in that the D input of a first D-type flip-flop DF1 and
the first input of a first OR gate (OR1) having three

inputs are connected to an input (DE) for the CMI-coded
signals,
in that the second input of this first OR gate is connected
to a terminal for an inverted first clock signal

(
T1
) and the clock input of the first D-type flip-flop is
connected to a terminal for a second clock signal (T2),
in that the inverting output (
Q
) of the first D-type
flip-flop (DF1) is connected to the third input of the

first OR gate (OR1),
in that the output terminal of the first OR gate (OR1)
constitutes the phase discriminator output (PDR),
in that the first clock signal (T1 and 
T1
) is the clock
signal of the binary signal corresponding to the CMI

signals, and
in that the second clock signal (T2 and 
T2
) is the clock
signal of the CMI signals.
Phase discriminator according to Patent Claim 1,

characterized

in that the D input of a second D-type flip-flop (DF2)
and the first input of a second OR gate (OR2) having two

inputs are connected to the non-inverting output (Q) of
the first D-type flip-flop (DF1), in that the clock input

of the second D-type flip-flop (DF2) is connected to a
source for an inverted second clock signal (
T2
), in that
the second input of the second OR gate (OR2) is connected 

to the inverting output (
Q
) of the second D-type flip-flop
(DF2), and in that the output of the said second OR

gate is connected via a terminal (PDR) to an additional
input of that loop amplifier whose first input is connected

to the phase discriminator output (PDR).
Phase discriminator according to Patent Claim 2,

characterized

in that the D input of a third D-type flip-flop (DF3) is
connected to the non-inverting output (Q) of the second

D-type flip-flop (DF2), and the clock input of the said

third D-type flip-flop is connected to the clock input of
the first D-type flip-flop (DF1),
in that the non-inverting output (Q) of the third D-type
flip-flop (DF3) is connected to a first input and the

inverting output (Q) to a second input of a CMI binary
code converter (CBW), in that the third input of this CMI

binary converter is connected to the non-inverting output
(Q) and the fourth input to the inverting output (
Q
) of
the first D-type flip-flop (DF1),
in that the clock input is connected to a terminal for
the first clock signal (T1), and in that the CMI binary

converter is a gate network which, in the form of a
coincidence circuit, generates binary signals at its

output (BA) in response to the occurrence of specific
input pulses.
