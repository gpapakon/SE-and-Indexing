<ABSTRACT>
Device for stupefying animals, abovementioned 
device comprising a series of cages (2) which are displaced 

by a drive mechanism (4, 5) in a pit (1), which 
cages (2) include a bottom (8), two sides (10, 100), and 

on the ends of which there are preferably one or two 
walls or doors, in which means act on one of the sides 

and on the bottom in order to allow the bottom (8) to 
rotate about a first axle (9) and in order to allow or 

cause the first side to move so as to form an opening 
(12) between the abovementioned side (10) and the bottom 

(8) for removing a stupefied animal from the cage, 
characterized in that the device comprises two means, the 

first means (7) of which allows the cage (2) or the 
bottom (8) thereof to rotate relative to the first axle 

(9) without forming an opening (12) between said first 
side (10) and the bottom (8) for removing an animal from 

the cage in such a manner that a motive power is applied 
to the animal lying in the cage, in the direction of a 

first side (10), while the second means prevents an 
opening (12) between said first side (10) and the bottom 

(8) for the release of an animal from the cage being 
formed during the rotation of the bottom (8) by the first 

means.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for stupefying
animals which are placed in cages and are conveyed to a
pit, for example to a pit containing CO2.Such devices are known. French Patent 1 125 412,
for example, discloses a device which comprises a series
of cages which are driven by a chain and a motor. In said
device, an animal is moved into a cage, conveyed to a CO2
pit in order to be stupefied, and taken out of the cage
after stupefaction.The cages are provided with a hinged side having
a locking system which prevents the side from being
opened during the displacement of the cage in the CO2
pit.The bottom of the cage does not pivot prior to
the opening thereof, as a result of which the removal of
an animal has to be carried out manually. In addition,
the pivot of the hinge on the side is located near the
bottom, which makes it necessary to lift the side back up
in order to close it.A device according to said French patent is
therefore not suitable to stupefy a large number of
animals, as the removal of animals and reclosing the
sides of the cages takes a lot of time.US-A-3 828 396 discloses a device for stupefying
animals in which the animals rest on a carrier, which
carrier includes two sides between which the animal is
located. Said device uses a temporary bottom during the
placement of an animal in the carrier. In order to remove
an animal, the carrier is rotated through ± 120° which
requires a lot of energy. Moreover, as the stupefied
animal does not rest on a bottom, removal of the animal
is difficult and cannot be carried out completely automatically
or without the assistance of a worker.In order to overcome the disadvantages of the
abovementioned device according to US-A-3 828 396, a
device is disclosed in which the cages are provided with 
a bottom and a side, which are mounted rotatably relative
to the cage and which are connected to each other in such
a manner that when the animal is being unloaded and the
cage recloses, the rotation of the bottom causes the side
to rotate and the rotation of the side causes the bottom
to rotate. As the bottom is mounted on an axle, a large
force is required to rotate the bottom, which force is
provided by the drive mechanism of the cages. The drive
mechanism is thus overdimensioned for moving the cages,
and for causing the bottom as well as the side to rotate
in order to form an opening through which the animal can
be removed from the cage.The removal of an animal from the cage takes up
a lot of time, as this is mainly dependent on the
rotation of the bottom

removing an animal from the cage. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that abovementioned first side (10) is

mounted rotatably on an axle (11), and in that the second
means applies a force to the first side (10) in order to

prevent, during the rotation of the bottom (8) by the
first means, the abovementioned side (10) rotating relative

to its axle (11), thereby forming an opening (12)
for releasing an animal from the cage.
