<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a method of measuring the OF width of 
a cylindrical single crystal ingot using an optical non-contact 

type displacement measuring device. This method 
can avoid the labour and measurement errors as generally 

seen in the conventional manual method and provide an 
easy and precise measurement. Further, the method can be 

automated if necessary. This method comprises the steps 
of detecting the boundary points between the OF and the 

round surface of the single crystal ingot from the 
displacement to be obtained by scanning the sensor 

while detecting the distance between the sensor and the 
ingot surface including the OF, and calculating the OF 

width C from the scanning distance A of the sensor from 
the first boundary point detection position to the second 

boundary point detection position and the difference B 
between the first distance l₁ from the first boundary 

point to the sensor and the second distance l₂ from the 
sensor to the second boundary point.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
measuring with ease the width of the orientation flat 
(hereinafter referred to as "OF") which indicates the 
crystallographic orientation of a single crystal ingot. The measurement of the OF width in the surface of 
a cylindrical single crystal ingot has been carried out 
by reading graduations of a scale, such as slide calipers, 
placed on the corresponding OF portion. However, such 
a manual measurement requires much labour and can not 
avoid measurement errors. Thus an easy and precise 
method of measuring the OF width has been required. Optical scanning devices which map a profile of the 
object are known from numerous documents, such as US-A-4 300 836. The present invention was made in the light of the 
above problems of the prior art. Therefore, the primary 
object of this invention is to provide a method of measuring 
the OF width of a single crystal ingot using an optical non-contact 
type displacement measuring device, which can avoid 
the labour and measurement errors as inevitably occurring 
in the aforementioned manual method and realize an easy and 
precise measurement which can be automated if necessary. According to the present invention, there is 
provided a method of measuring the OF width of a single 
crystal ingot by the use of an apparatus including an 
optical non-contact type displacement measuring device  
 
having a sensor, means for fixing the OF of the single 
crystal ingot facing to the sensor, means for scanning 
the sensor in the direction normal to the major axis of 
the single crystal ingot and means for measuring the 
scanning distance, comprising the steps of: detecting 
the boundary points between the OF and the round surface 
of the single crystal ingot from the displacement to be 
measured by scanning the sensor while detecting the 
distance between the sensor and the ingot surface including 
the OF; measuring the scanning distance A of the 
sensor from the first boundary point detection position 
to the second boundary point detection position; 
detecting the first distance l1 from the first boundary 
point to the sensor and the second distance l2 from the 
sensor to the second boundary point to obtain b = 
|l1 - l2| ; and calculating the OF width C in 
accordance with the following equation (1). 
C2 = A2 + B2The optical non-contact type displacement measuring 
device of this invention can measure the position of an 
object by forming an image on a photo-position detector 
with the reflection light which is originally
