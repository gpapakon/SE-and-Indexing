Device on powered hand tools which consists of a
tool holder (10) and a tool shank (11) inserted therein

and is intended for the rotary driving of percussion
and/or drilling tools which have grooves (23) for the

rotary driving, which grooves (23) are open towards the
shank end of the tools and in which at least two axially

running, preferably diametrically opposite rotary
drivers (24) projecting inwards in a location bore (17)

of the tool holder (10) engage, in which arrangement, in
a circumferential region of the location bore (17)

offset from the rotary drivers (24), at least one
locking body (19), guided so as to yield outwards in a

radial aperture of the tool receptacle (16), engages in
an elongated locking hollow (25), limiting the axial

movement of the tool in the tool receptacle, in the tool
shank and can be arrested in this position,

characterized in that the at least one locking hollow
(25) of the tool shank (11) is designed in its axial

extent in such a way that it is deeper in the front
region than in the rear region, so that, in the working

position of the tool (12), the locking body (19),
assigned to the locking hollow (25), of the tool

receptacle (16) engages deeper in the front region of
the locking hollow (25) than in the idling position in

the rear region.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the depth of the at least one locking hollow (25) 

increases linearly from the rear end to the front end,
and in that that region of the locking body (19) which

engages therein projects radially inwards to the same
extent, increasingly axially forwards, from the location

bore (17).
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the depth of the at least one locking hollow (25)

increases forwards only in the rear region, preferably
up to half the axial length, and remains the same in the

front region, and in that the at least one locking body
(19), except for its rounded-off ends, is dimensioned to

be uniformly high and uniformly wide as viewed in the
axial direction.
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the at least one locking hollow

(25), with increasing depth, has an at least
approximately axially running plane flank (27) on its

longitudinal sides in the direction of rotation, which
flank (27) interacts with a correspondingly axially

running plane flank (28) on the longitudinal sides of
the locking body (19) for forming additional rotary

driving.
Tool for a device according to the preamble of
Claim 1, characterized in that the depth of the at least

one locking hollow (25) of the tool shank (11) increases
from the rear end to the front end, and in that the at

least one locking hollow (25), on its longitudinal side
lying in particular in the direction of rotation, has

with increasing depth an at least approximately axially
running plane flank (27) for additional rotary driving.
Tool according to Claim 5, characterized in that
two plane flanks (27) run parallel to one another on

both longitudinal sides of the at least one locking
hollow (25). 
Tool according to Claim 5 or 6, characterized in
that the depth of the at least one locking hollow (25)

increases from the rear end preferably up to the centre
and remains the same from there up to the front end.
Tool according to Claim 5 or 6, characterized in
that the locking hollow (25c) has at least two sections

of different depth, the rear flat section (33) merging
smoothly into the front deeper section (34).
Tool holder for a device according to the
preamble of Claim 1, characterized in that the at least

one locking body (19), in its arrested position, is
guided so as to yield radially outwards in a recess (18)

of the tool receptacle (16).
Tool holder according to Claim 9, characterized
in that the at least one locking body (19) is longer in

the axial direction than it is wide, its longitudinal
sides, as flanks (28) which run parallel to one another,

merging into a radial inside arched in a hump shape.
Tool holder according to Claim 9 or 10,
characterized in that a spring element (26) is arranged

between the at least one locking body (19) and an
arresting means (20) and presses the locking body (19)

radially inwards.
Tool holder according to Claim 11, characterized
in that the spring element (26a) is a solid body made of

rubber, plastic or a material which is elastically
deformable in a similar manner.
Tool holder according to one of Claims 9 to 12,
characterized in that the plunge depth of the at least

one locking body (19) can be sensed in order to control
the percussion intensity of the power tool (14). 
Tool holder according to Claim 11 or 12,
characterized in that the pressure of the spring element

(26a) on the locking body (19b) can be detected by a
sensor (32) in order to control the percussion intensity

of the power tool.
