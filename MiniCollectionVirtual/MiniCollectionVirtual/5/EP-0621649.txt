<ABSTRACT>
A battery pack (1) is connected to an external device (9) and to a power supply circuit (10) for the external device (9), and it 
energizes the external device (9) or is charged by the power supply circuit (10). An analog circuit (12) and a microcomputer (11) 

inside the battery pack (1) detect an ON/OFF state of the external device (9) and execute control in such a manner as to effect 

charging by the balance of power obtained by subtracting the maximum power consumption of the external device (9) from the 
total capacity of the power supply circuit (10) under the ON state and to effect charging by full use of the supply power from the 

power supply circuit (10) under the OFF state. This charge/discharge control is executed when the microcomputer (11) makes 
ON/OFF control of a charging switch (S1), a discharging switch (S2) and a switch (S4).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a battery pack employed as a power
source for a portable telephone, personal computer or a video
camera.There has hitherto been known a battery pack constituted by
a secondary cell, such as a lithium ion cell, NiCd cell or a
nickel hydrogen cell. Such known battery pack is in need of a
protective circuit which is arranged at a pre-set position within
the battery pack. A charging control circuit is separately
provided on a charger such as an ac adapter or on an external
unit such as a personal computer employing the battery pack. If
the excess discharging state is detected, the discharge is
discontinued appropriately.However, the voltage at each cell cannot be detected based
solely upon the terminal voltage of the battery pack, such that
the residual capacity cannot be measured accurately. Besides,
if any one of the cells reaches a pre-set over-discharge voltage,
the discharge is discontinued without regard to the terminal
voltage.This is particularly inconvenient with an equipment, such
as a personal computer, in which it is necessary to carry out an
operation of data storage before discontinuing the discharge. On the other hand, the control circuit needs to be designed uniquely in order to
adapt it to the characteristics of the secondary cell of the battery pack. If the control
circuit is provided outside of the battery pack, the problem of interchangeability
between the charger and the secondary cells arises with inconveniences in safety and
costs. It has therefore been desired to provide a small-sized compact battery pack in
which control may be made so as to take account of the characteristics of the cells of the
secondary battery of the battery pack and in which the load imposed on the external
equipment used with the battery pack may be minimized.In addition, when charging the battery pack with the power supplied from a
power circuit connected to the external equipment, it is necessary to change over the
charging operation depending on whether the external equipment is in the turned-on
state or in the turned-off state.EP-A-0 406 858 describes an arrangement for supplying power to telephone
apparatus having a battery unit provided therein. A battery charger serves as an adapter
converting power from an AC source into DC power available at three different current
levels. In this arrangement, charging/discharging is controlled by means provided
within the battery charger. During a first, rapid-charging phase, power is supplied to the
telephone apparatus/battery combination
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A battery pack (1) adapted to be connected, in use, to a power source circuit (10)
and to an external equipment (9), said external equipment (9) being connected to said

power source circuit (10), said battery pack (1) comprising a plurality of cells (5) and
means for controlling the charging current of said battery pack (1), the battery pack

being 
characterised in that
 it comprises integral charging control means (11,12)
comprising:


means for detecting the on/off state of said external equipment (9) when
connected thereto in use, and
said means for controlling the charging current of said battery pack (1), the
charging current control means being adapted such that, when connected to the external

equipment (9) and to the power source circuit (10) in use, said external equipment and
power source circuit being connected together, the battery pack draws power at a first

level, equal to the total supply power from said power source circuit (10), when the
detecting means detects the off state of the external equipment and, whenever the

detecting means detects the on state of the external equipment, the power drawn by the
battery pack is limited to a second level, less than the first level, said second level being

equal to the total supply power from said power source circuit (10) less the maximum
power consumed by said external equipment (9).
The battery pack as claimed in claim 1, and comprising switch means (S4)
controlled by said controlling means (11,12) during a first charging phase such that

when, in use, said detecting means detects the on state of the external equipment said
switch means (S4) intermittently alters the current fed from said power source circuit

(10) to the cells (5).
The battery pack as claimed in claim 2, wherein in use during a second charging
phase (S43), when said detecting means detects the on state of the connected external

equipment (9), said controlling means (11,12) controls said switching means (S4) so as
not to change state. 
The battery pack as claimed in any previous claim, and comprising means for
detecting voltage differences among the cells (5) at termination of charging and for

causing the cell having the maximum voltage to be discharged if the voltage differences
exceed a pre-set threshold, whereby to establish an equilibrium among the cell voltages.
The battery pack as claimed in any previous claim, and comprising switch means
(S2/S4) selectively inhibiting the discharge of the cells, said switch means being adapted

to change state at termination of charging such as to enable discharge after charging has
terminated.
The battery pack as claimed in any previous claim, and comprising switch means
(Fd) selectively inhibiting the discharge of the cells (5) and means (15) for detecting the

voltage state of the power source circuit (10) connected to the battery pack (1) in use,
said switch means (Fd) being adapted to enable discharge of the cells (5) when the

detecting means detects the off state of the connected power source circuit (10) during
charging of the battery pack.
The battery pack as claimed in any previous claim, and further comprising a
battery loading terminal (13) to which a voltage is applied when the battery pack (1) is

connected to said external equipment (9), the operation/non-operation of an internal
circuit of said battery pack (1) being changed over dependent upon the voltage at said

battery loading terminal (13).
