<ABSTRACT>
A differential gearing for a motor vehicle, comprising a motion input ring (1) linked in rotation with a differential casing (8) closed by a cover (4) and containing a set of satellites (11) driven by the casing (8) in rotation about a shaft (10), so as to distribute the movement between two coaxial output planetaries (6, 12), characterised in that the means (2) for fastening the ring (1) on the casing (8) are separate from the means (7, 24) for fastening the cover (4) on this casing.

<CLAIMS>
A transmission differential mounted as output from a gear box and retained 
axially by first and second bearings (3, 3', 3'', 14) with respect to the gear box 

mechanism casing (23) and a differential casing (22), comprising a differential housing 
(8) supporting a movement input crown gear (1) and a cover (4) which closes the 

housing (8) on an assembly of satellites (11) driven in rotation about an axis in order to 
ensure the distribution of the movement between two coaxial output planetary gears,
 
characterised in that: 


the first and second bearings (3, 3', 3'', 14) are supported by the housing (8), 
the cover (4) is secured on the housing (8) by means separate from those of the crown 
gear (1), 
the crown gear (1) is offset laterally outwards with respect to the cover (4) so that it 
projects with respect to the first and second bearings (3, 3', 3'', 14). 
A transmission differential as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the 
fastening of the crown gear (1) on the housing (8) and that of the cover (4) on the 

housing (8) are provided by first and second fastening screws (2, 7) respectively. 
A transmission differential as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the 
crown gear (1) is secured by screws (2) on the housing (8), while the cover (4) is held 

thereon by a clip (24). 
A transmission differential as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the 
first bearings (3) are ball bearings. 
A transmission differential as claimed in claims 1, 2 or 3, characterised in that 
the first bearings are conical bearings (3'). 
A transmission differential as claimed in claims 1, 2 or 3, characterised in that 
the first bearings are conical bearings (3'').
