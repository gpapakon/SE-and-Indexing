<ABSTRACT>
The subjects of the invention are kits comprising free or support bound peptide mixtures (sub-libraries) as components, methods for their preparation and method for their use in discovery of bioactive peptides as potential drugs. Groups of free peptide mixtures (sub-libraries) forming components of the kit may carry different color or fluorescent labels facilitating their identification. The solid support in kits comprising support bound peptides may carry color or fluorescent labels as well, but the size or the specific gravity of the beads are also used as markers. The kits can be applied in all kinds of biological screening tests, including binding tests with macromolecules (like proteins), cells or tissues. The amino acid sequences of bioactive peptides can generally be determined in three stages: (i) determination of amino acid occurrence list by use of amino acid tester sub-kit, (ii) determination of occurrence library by use of the first sub-kit, and (iii) determination of sequences by use of second sub-kits.

<DESCRIPTION>
The subject of the invention comprises special peptide kits, 
processes for their synthesis and methods for their application in 
identification of biologically active peptides (named "domino strategy") 
which can be utilized as potential drugs. Components of the kits are 
multicomponent mixtures of free or support bound peptides or peptide 
derivatives. Submission in logical order of components of the kits to 
binding experiments with living cells, tissues or proteins or execution of 
other kinds of biological or biochemical tests, and evaluation of their 
result, makes possible to determine the amino acid sequence of the 
bioactive peptides. The invention is based on the highly efficient synthetic method 
introduced by the inventors and their colleagues: (i) Furka et al. 
Abstr. 14th Int. Congr. Biochem., Prague, Czechoslovakia, 1988, Vol 5, p. 
47.; (ii) Furka et al. Abstr. 10th Int. Symp. Med.Chem., Budapest, 
Hungary, 1988, p. 288.; (iii) Furka et al. Int. J. Peptide Protein Res., 
1991, 37, 487-493. This "portioning-mixing" method makes possible to 
prepare in a couple of days multicomponent peptide mixtures comprising, 
for example, all possible sequences of: tripeptides (8 thousand), 
tetrapeptides (160 thousand), pentapeptides (3.2 million) etc. It is a 
characteristic feature of this solid phase method that all peptide 
molecules formed on one bead of the solid support have the same sequence. Later on Lam et al. (Nature, 1991, 354, 82-84) published a method 
identical with that of ours for the synthesis of support bound peptide 
mixtures and developed an identification procedure based on specific 
binding of protein molecules to the bead carrying the bioactive peptide, 
and determination of the sequence of the active peptide by using a 
sequenator. Houghten and his colleagues (Nature, 1991, 354, 85-86) 
described a slightly modified version of our synthetic method together 
with an iterative identification procedure applicable for mixtures of free 
peptides. Fodor et al. (Science, 1991, 251, 767-773) also developed a new 
synthetic and identification method in which the peptides were synthesized 
in different but predetermined locations on the surface of a glass  
 
microscope slide. In the method of Scott and Smith (Science,1990, 249, 
386-390) the peptide sequences are expressed on the surface of phage after 
inserting into its genome random nucleotide sequences. WO 93/22684 concerns first order sub-library kits of oligomers (peptides and 
oligonucleotides) coupled to an unlabeled solid
