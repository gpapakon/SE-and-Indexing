<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the preparation of polyisocyanates containing isocyanurate and/or uretdione groups and having a reduced colour index and improved shelf life (storage stability) by catalytic oligomerisation, known per se, of aliphatic and/or cycloaliphatic diisocyanates and treatment of the oligermerisation products with peroxycarboxylic acids.

<CLAIMS>
A process for the preparation of isocyanurates 
and/or uretdione-containing polyisocyanates having a 

reduced color index and improved shelf life by catalytic 
oligomerization of aliphatic and/or cycloaliphatic 

diisocyanates, wherein the oligomerisation catalysts used 
are hydroxides or organic salts of weak acids having 

tetraalkylammonium groups, hydroxides or organic salts of 
weak acids having hydroxyalkylammonium groups, alkali 

metal salts or tin, zinc or lead salts of alkanecarboxylic 
acids and the oligomerization products are 

treated with peroxycarboxylic acids. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
starting diisocyanate is 1,6-diisocyanatohexane. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
peroxycarboxylic acids are used for deactivating the 

oligomerization catalyst, and the oligomerization product 
is then further treated in a conventional manner. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
peroxycarboxylic acids are added to the oligomerization 

product after the removal of the unconverted monomeric 
diisocyanates. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4, 
wherein the peroxycarboxylic acids are used in an amount 

of from 10 to 10,000 ppm, based on the diisocyanate used. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 5, 
wherein the peroxycarboxylic acids are used in an amount 

of from 50 to 1,000 ppm, based on the diisocyanate used. 
An isocyanurate- and uretdione-containing polyisocyanate 
having a reduced color index, prepared as 

claimed in any of claims 1 to 6.  
 
Use of an isocyanurate- and uretdione-containing 
polyisocyanate as claimed in claim 7 as an isocyanate 

component of polyurethane one-component and two-component 
finishes.
