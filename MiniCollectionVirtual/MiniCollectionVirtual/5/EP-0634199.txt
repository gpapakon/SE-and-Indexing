<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a fine filter for water having an adjustable filtering and backwashing operation, in particular for domestic water, having a filter housing which can be built into the water pipe, which housing contains at least one filter insert which can be cleaned by brushes lying on its surface, and contains a hand-actuated flush valve by which the water stream entering into the filter can be reversed for the backwashing operation with respect to the direction of its passage through the filter insert. The object of the invention is to develop the known construction in such a way that the entire surface of the filter cloth of the filter insert is available both for the filter operation and for the backwash operation and to simplify the construction in terms of assembly. This object is achieved by the filter insert being arranged fixed in the filter housing and surrounded by a brush holder which is adjustable in height with respect to the filter insert along the housing longitudinal axis, the base of which brush holder, situated at its lower end, being connected to the flush valve in such a way that the flush valve is closed in the filtering operation and is open in the backwashing operation.

Water-microfiltering device comprising controllable filtering and backwashing elements,
especially for household purposes, provided with a filter housing installable into the water

pipe, having a cylindrical filter insert which can be cleaned by brushes contacting its surface
and being connected to a brush holder surrounding the filter insert, and further provided

with a hand operated washing valve, by which the water stream entering the filter
can be controlled for the backwashing operation, 
characterized in that
 the cylindrical
filter insert (23) is provided at its upper end with a flansch (14) holding it fixed and stationary

within in the filter housing (2), that the brush holder (3), extending together with
the axially extending brushes (4) coaxially to the filter insert (23), is covered at its upper

end by a disk (25), which is sealed against the outer wall of the filter insert (23) by means
of a sealing ring (29), which brush holder is provided with a bottom (24) holding the

washing valve (5) in closed condition during the filtering procedure during which the brush
holder is located in a lowered position, wherein the water stream enters the filter through

the screen web (17) of the filter insert (23) into the interior thereof, and that during the
backwashing operation the washing valve (5) is opened by shifting the brush holder (3) to

its lifted position rotating simultaneously the brush holder, wherein the brushes (4) are
contacting the surface of the screen web (17) and the water stream entering the filter enters

above the disk (25) and the sealing ring (29) through the screen web (17) the filter insert
(23) and is divided there in an upwardly directed stream leaving the filter and a

downwardly directed stream leaving the interior of the filter insert (23) through the screen 
web in outwardly direction through the washing valve together with the filtering residue

deposited on the screen web.
Water-microfiltering device according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the lower end of
the brush holder (3) is proved with a perforated bottom (24) screwed onto the valve piston

(6) of the washing valve (5) positionable onto the head (26) of the guiding sleeve (7) of
the washing valve, which bottom is together with the valve piston during opening and

closing the washing valve axially as well as rotatably moveable together with the brushes
(4) arranged with respect to the stationary filter insert (23).
Water-microfiltering device according to one of the claims 1 to 2, 
characterized in that

the filter housing (3) consisting of a transparent material and receiving at its lower end the
guiding sleeve (7) of the washing valve (5) and at its upper end opposite to the head (10)

of the water-microfiltering device an annular flansch (21) which can be screwed by means
of a nut (20) onto the head (10) in a water tight manner.
Water-microfiltering device according to one of the claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 a
head piece (11) is laterally connected to the head (10) for the water input (12) and water

output (13) and that the water input and the water output (13) are entering in axial diretion
into the filter housing (2) and are turned around within said housing about 90Â° in direction

to the head (10) and radially thereto.
