<ABSTRACT>
Eddy current probes for multi-layered structures include a body of a highly permeability material which is shaped to include a central core and an additional wall. A drive coil is wound around the central core of the body and a plurality of sense coils are located in an array in association with the additional wall. An outer drive coil is wound about the outside of the additional wall. The central drive coil is excited with a first alternating high frequency signal producing eddy currents primarily in the top of the layered structure. These eddy currents are sensed with the sense coil array and analyzed for structural defects in the top surface of the layered structure. Next the central core coil is excited with a second signal of a lower frequency than the first signal. Such signal introduces eddy currents in deeper layers of the structure. Such eddy currents are sensed by the sense coils and the signals so sensed are stored. The outer drive coil is now excited with a low frequency signal and the sense coils operated to detect eddy currents in deeper layers of the structure. The signal from excitation of the outer drive coil is scaled with respect to the signal from the central core coil for separating signal indicative of defects from that indicative of differences in the structure of the underlaying components of the layered structure.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to devices for detecting cracks, flaws and other
defects in a layered structure. More specifically, the devices utilize eddy currents
that are generated within the layers of the structure for the detection of
the cracks, flaws and other defects in the layers of the structure.Various instruments for flaw detection in structures have been developed
that rely upon the generation of eddy currents in the body of the structure being
tested. Flaws in the metallic structures are detected by their perturbation of
the eddy currents. The eddy currents are generated in the metallic structures
by positioning the structures within an alternating magnetic field. Perturbation
of the eddy currents because of the localized presence of a defect in the metallic
structure creates a resultant change in the magnetic flux associated with these
eddy currents. When such change is detected, it is an indication of the presence
of defects in the structure. Such use of eddy currents has been practiced for
detecting flaws in solid metallic slabs, metallic pipes and in layered metallic
structures such as the outside surfaces of aircraft.United States patent 3,437,918 to Arnelo describes an eddy current detection
system for a slab structure. Further, eddy current detection systems for
slabs are described in United States patent 4,534,405 to Hulek, et al., U.S.S.R.
patent 1,155,930, Japanese patent 60-147648, and Japanese patent 59-162448.
Eddy current detection for solid pipe like structures is disclosed in United States
patent 3,694,740 to Bergstrand, et al., Japanese patent 61-14569, British patent
631,987 to Rudorff and United States patent 4,855,677 to Clark, et al. Detection
systems for layered structures are found in United States patents 4,219,774 to
Rogel, et al., 4,414,508 to Davis, et al., 4,495,466 to Lakin, et al., 4,496,904 to
Harrison, 4,445,089 to Harrison, 4,677,379 to Arnaud, et al. and 4,095,181 to
Harris et al.Many of the above patents describe systems wherein a single coil is utilized
to induce a magnetic field in a test piece. Flaws are detected by noting changes
in the impedance of the test coil. In other of the above patents, both a drive coil
and a sense coil are utilized. Generally detection of flaws is achieved utilizing
roltage variations in the sense coil. The voltage variations are detected utilizing 
a null bridge.In the above noted Clark patent, United States patent 4,855,677, a plurality
of coaxial coils, each driven at a different frequency, is utilized to detect flaws

signal for anomalies indicative of said probe being off-centered from said

area to be inspected and said probe not being oriented parallel to said area
to be inspected.
The method of claim 39 further including the steps of:

calibrating said probe by positioning and centering said probe
against a layer structure known to be free of defects:
driving said core drive coil with said second input signal;
operating each of said sense coils to detect calibration signals
related to eddy currents generated in said structure;
storing said calibration signal detected by each of said sense coils;
and
comparing said additional output signal to said calibration signal to
determine a scaling factor.
A method of inspecting a layered structure according to
claim 39 further comprising:


moving said probe through a closed orbit that is centered about an
off-centered axis that is parallel to and radially displaced from a central

axis of said core.
The method of claim 43 including:

moving said probe in said orbit by oscillating said probe about said
off-centered axis without rotating said probe about said off-centered axis.
The method of claim 43 including: 

moving said probe in said orbit by rotating said probe about said
off-centered axis.
