<ABSTRACT>
Zinc-bromine battery with circulating electrolytes, motor-driven pumps with pump chambers (8, 9), containers (7, 6) for the electrolytes, dipolar electrodes (2) and separators (3) of synthetic material fitted between them, in which the edges (33) of the separators (3) and the electrodes (2) are welded together, and electrolyte inlet and outlet lines (13, 14) allocated to the electrode chambers thus formed, and possibly heat exchangers for the electrolytes. One gas and liquid-proof chamber unit with at least one container (6), catholyte inlet and outlet lines (13, 14), a pump chamber and cathode chambers is formed which is connected to another gas and liquid-proof chamber unit consisting of another container (7), anolyte inlet and outlet lines (13, 14), another pump chamber (9) and anode chambers, especially solely via separators (3).

Zinc-bromine battery including circulating 
electrolytes, motor-driven pumps and comprising pump 

chambers (8, 9), electrolyte pressure-compensating tanks (7, 
6) , bipolar electrodes (2) and separators arranged 

therebetween and made from plastic material, with frames 
(33) of said separators and frames (22) of said electrodes 

(2) which show a bigger thickness than the central portion 
of said electrodes (2) being soldered together, such an 

assembly further including electrolyte feeding and draining 
ducts (12, 14) which are associated with the so-formed 

electrode chambers, and, if necessary, heat exchangers for 
said electrolytes, characterized in that at least a tank 

(6), catholyte feeding and draining ducts (12, 14), a pump 
chamber (8) and cathode chambers form a gaz and liquid tight 

unit, which is connected, exclusively through separators 
(3), to another unit of this type, including a further thank 

(7), anolyte feeding and draining ducts (12, 14), a further 
pump chamber (9) and anode chambers, and in that, between 

both electrolyte tanks (6, 7), for pressure compensating 
purposes, two chambers (18, 19) are provided which are 

spaced apart by a rubber-type resilient diaphragm (20). 
The zinc-bromine battery of claim 1, 
characterized in that both pumps can be driven by a common 

motor (10). 
The zinc-bromine battery of claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the liquid capacity of said tanks (6, 

7) respectively corresponds to at least the anolyte and 
catholyte volume. 
The zinc-bromine battery of any claim 1 to 
3, characterized in that both tanks (6, 7) are side by side 

arranged, in relation to said electrodes and separators. 
The zinc-bromine battery of any claim 1 to 
4, characterized in that, with the battery being in working 

order, both tanks (6, 7) are arranged above said electrodes 
and separators.  

 
The zinc-bromine battery of any claim 1 to 
5, characterized in that each tank (6, 7) includes a 

closable opening with a view to drawing and re-filling said 
electrolyte liquid. 
The zinc-bromine battery of any claim 1-6, 
characterized in that said separators (3) and/or said 

electrodes (2) show on the frames (22, 23) thereof, 
continuous coinciding passages (23, 24), e.g. which are 

soldered around the edges thereof, through which continuous 
ducts are formed as an electrolyte feeding duct and an 

electrolyte draining duct, each having by-passes (25, 26) 
towards said electrolyte chambers. 
The zinc-bromine battery of one of claims 
1 to 7, characterized in that an electrical fuse is arranged 

between the terminal contact (4, 5) of an electrode and the 
conductor directed towards the heat sink element. 
The zinc-bromine battery of one of claims 
1 to 8, characterized in that said battery includes at least 

a handle, especially two opposite handle bars. 
A process for storing a zinc-bromine 
battery of claims 1 to 9, characterized by the steps of 

carrying out a definite discharge of said circulating 
electrolyte battery, and then of storing said battery in a 

discharged condition. 
The process of storing a zinc-bromine 
battery of claim 10, characterized in that an electric drive 

for electrolyte(s) pumps is preferably used for said 
definite discharge as a heat sinking element.
