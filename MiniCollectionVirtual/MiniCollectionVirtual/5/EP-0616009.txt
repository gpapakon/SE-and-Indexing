<ABSTRACT>
Copolymer compositions useful as impact 
modifiers are prepared by blending, under reactive 

conditions, at least one functionalized addition polymer 
with an excess of at least one functionalized elastomer 

reactive therewith to form a preblend, and subsequently 
blending said preblend, under reactive conditions with a 

further amount of at least one functionalized addition 
polymer. The preferred addition polymers and elastomers 

are carbamate-functionalized styrene-acrylonitrile 
copolymers and maleic anhydride-grafted EPDM elastomers, 

respectively. The product of the two-step blending 
operation is a composition comprising a continuous addition 

polymer phase and elastomer particles dispersed therein, 
said elastomer particles containing occluded addition 

polymer. Said composition is stabilized by copolymer 
formation between the elastomer particles and the addition 

polymer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to thermoplastic
compositions. More particularly, it relates to the
preparation of copolymer compositions in a novel physical
form, said copolymer compositions being capable of
employment as impact modifiers for a wide variety of
thermoplastic polymers.The incorporation of elastomeric impact
modifiers in thermoplastic polymers to increase the impact
strength thereof has been known for some time. The
polymers in which the impact modifiers are incorporated
constitute a wide variety; examples are olefin polymers,
styrene-acrylonitrile copolymers, polycarbonates and
polyphenylene ethers.Various types of elastomeric impact modifiers
are employed in combination with such polymers. Their
identity depends in large part on that of the polymer being
modified. For example, styrene-acrylonitrile copolymers
(hereinafter sometimes "SAN copolymers") are frequently
modified with elastomeric copolymers of ethylene, a C3-8
monoolefin and a non-conjugated diene. Most often, the
C3-8 monoolefin is propylene and the elastomers are termed
"EPDM elastomers". Suitable impact modifiers for
polycarbonates include styrene-alkyl (meth)acrylate
copolymers. For polyphenylene ethers, block copolymers of
styrene and conjugated dienes such as butadiene or isoprene
may be employed, as may high impact polystyrenes, the
latter comprising a continuous phase of polystyrene with
polybutadiene particles containing occluded polystyrene
dispersed therein. In recent years, functionalized polymer blends
have become increasingly important since they provide a
route to compatibilized materials formed from normally
incompatible polymers. For example, polyphenylene ethers
are incompatible with polyamides and linear polyesters
unless the latter are present in very small proportions, but
a polyphenylene ether containing functional groups reactive
with the amine or carboxy end groups of polyamides or the
carboxy end groups of polyesters can form a copolymer
therewith and said copolymer is effective as a
compatibilizer in a blend of the polyphenylene ether and the
polyamide or polyester.The present invention is based on the discovery
of a method for preparing highly compatible blends of
functionalized addition polymers and functionalized
elastomers, said blends containing dispersed elastomer
particles having a substantial proportion of occluded
addition polymer therein. It is further based on the
discovery that such blends are unusually effective as
impact modifiers for thermoplastic polymers in general.
When so employed, they
