<ABSTRACT>
High flexibility bentonite panel for waterproofing soil, hydraulic works, buildings and the like comprising a granular bentonite layer glued between two permeable synthetic fabrics by means of an adhesive comprising a copolymer of lower alcohols acrylic esters. Evenly distributed impressions are formed on a side of the panel by heat pressing to increase compactness and grip on the ground. The bentonite layer is deposited on a foamy layer of adhesive and then sprayed with an aqueous solution of the same.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a high flexibility 
bentonite panel, in particular for the waterproofing of 
terrain and for hydraulic and construction works. The invention also relates to a process for the 
production of said panel. Waterproofing panels of the above-mentioned type are 
already known and have in common the characteristic of 
comprising a layer of bentonite, in particular sodium 
bentonite, which in the presence of humidity becomes 
hydrated, swelling greatly and forming an impermeable 
barrier. In US-A-4048373 a panel of the above-mentioned 
type is disclosed in which the layer of bentonite is 
incorporated between two faces of a sheet of corrugated 
paperboard in the spaces delimitated by the intermediate 
corrugated sheet of said paperboard. The bentonite is in 
a granular form and preferably has thickening substances 
added to it such as salts of polyacrylic acid with a 
molecular weight compressed between 500,000 and 2,000,000 
and higher, polyacrylonitrile, polyvinyl acetate and 
polyvinyl alcohol. In the waterproofing panel according 
to US-A-4501788, the layer of bentonite, in granules, is 
placed between a permeable flexible support of preferably 
synthetic fabric, to which it is glued, and a protective 
covering which prevents the loss of granules and allows 
for the stocking of the panel in rolls. In the waterproofing panel according to EP-A-278 
419, the layer of bentonite is placed between two  
 
synthetic fabrics sewn to one another with transverse 
stitches every 10-15 cm. One of the principle inconveniences encountered in 
the use of known waterproofing panels consists in the fact 
that they are not well-suited to the waterproofing of 
inclined or vertical walls, such as the sides of tanks, on 
one hand because of the scarce friction between the panel 
and the ground and on the other hand because of the 
tendency of the granules of bentonite to slide downwards 
due to their weight thus forming pockets of bentonite in 
some areas and consequent reduction of the thickness of 
the waterproofing agent in others. This occurs in 
particular in panels in which the layer of bentonite is 
held by means of stitches, but it is also present in those 
in which the layer of bentonite is glued to a support. In 
regard to this, it is important to note that in an 
improved version of the waterproofing panel according to 
above-mentioned US-A-4501788, recently put on the market, 
besides having provided for the gluing of the bentonite 
layer to the support, the layer of bentonite is also

A process for producing a waterproofing panel for 
terrain and for hydraulic and construction works, 

comprising a layer of granular bentonite characterized by 
the fact that it comprises the following steps: 


distributing in the form of a foam an adhesive 
formed by a copolymer of acrylic esters of low-grade 

alcohols, having such properties that it rehydrates and relatively slowly solubilitates in the presence of water, on a first flexible permeable support; 
placing said layer of granular bentonite on said 
foam covered support; 
spraying an aqueous solution of said adhesive over 
said layer; 
covering said bentonite layer with a second 
flexible permeable support;  

 
heat drying the manufactured product thus 
obtained; 
submitting the manufactured product to heat 
pressing realizing a plurality of uniformly distributed 

impressions on one of the supports. 
Process according to claim 7, wherein said first 
support is formed by a synthetic fabric in polypropylene 

internally needled with a non-woven fabric nylon, said 
second permeable support being formed by a polyester 

fabric. 
Process according to claims 7 and 8, wherein the 
adhesive in the form of a foam is an aqueous solution of 

said adhesive containing from 0.2 to 3% of a surface-active 
agent. 
Process according to claims 7 to 9, wherein the 
amount of adhesive used is comprised between 500 and 1500 

g/m2. 
Process according to claim 10, wherein the 
amount of adhesive used is comprised between 700 and 1000 

g/m2. 
Process according to claims 7 to 11, wherein 
sodium hydroxide is added to said adhesive to reach a pH of 

8.
