<ABSTRACT>
Proposed is a network interface (12) designed for two-wire reception via a serial bus. The interface (12) has a differential receiver (14) connected to two input line (RX0, RX1). The interface (12) also has means for detecting fault conditions in the bus lines (18, 19). The interface is designed in such a way that, when a fault is detected, the interface goes over to single-wire operation in order to maintain the flow of data. This is done by applying a fixed clamping potential to one input line (RX0, RX1), the clamping potential being chosen such that the potential difference between the two input lines (RX0, RX1) is the same for both bit levels.

<CLAIMS>
Network interface for a serial bus having at 
least two bus lines, especially for a bus in motor 

vehicles, having a differential receiver to which at 
least two input lines are connected, each input line 

being connected to one of the two bus lines, having means 
for recognizing error states in the digital transmission 

of data via the bus, especially short-circuit or 
interruption states in the bus lines, having means for 

reproducing the reception of data after an error state 
has been recognized, the means switching one of the at 

least two input lines to a terminal potential and the 
data reception being continued via that input line which 

is not connected to the terminal potential, characterized 
in that the network interface (12) has first further 

means which set the magnitude of the voltage difference 
between two input lines (RX0, RX1) during error-free 

operation to a different magnitude for both bit levels, 
that is to say for the recessive and the dominant bit 

level, (rec, dom), and in that the network interface (12) 
has second further means (R1, R2, R3, R4, S0, S1) which 

set the terminal potential (UK0, UK1) for the respective 
input line (RX0, RX1) in accordance with the formulae: 


UK0 = (U
RX1
(dom) + U
RX1
(rec)) / 2 
 
and 


UK1 = (U
RX0
(dom) + U
RX0
(rec)) / 2 
 
U
RX1
(dom) and U
RX1
(rec) representing the respective input 
potential for one of the two bit levels (rec, dom) on the 

one input line (RX1), and U
RX0
(dom) and U
RX0
(rec) 
representing the respective input potential for one of  

 
the two bit levels (rec, dom) on the other input line 

(RX0). 
Network interface according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that two controllable switches (S0, S1) are 

provided as the means for reproducing the reception, 
which switches (S0, S1) connect in each case at least one 

input line (RX0, RX1) to one bus line (18, 19) in their 
first switching state (a), and connect in each case at 

least one input line (RX0, RX1) to a point of a resistor 
network (R1, R2, R3, R4) in their second switching state 

(b). 
Network interface according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that the first switch (S0) connects the first 

input line (RX0) to a different point on the resistor 
network from that to which the second switch (S1) connects 

the second input line (RX1). 
Network interface according to one of Claims 2 or 
3, characterized in that the resistor network (R1, R2, 

R3, R4) is designed such that a recessive bit level is 
present on the two input lines (RX0, RX1) for the case in 

which both switches (S0, S1) have been moved into 
position (b). 
Network interface according to one of the preceding 
Claims, characterized in that a bus coupling network 

(15) is connected between the input lines (RX0, RX1) and 
the bus lines (18, 19). 
Network interface according to Claim 5, characterized 
in that the bus coupling network (15) contains 

two input voltage dividers (20), to which the at least 
two bus lines (18, 19) are connected.
