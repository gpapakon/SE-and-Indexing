<ABSTRACT>
The device exhibits a first image processing stage (1) for generating first picture signals and a second image processing stage (2) for generating second picture signals and a switch-over device for switching between the first and second picture signals. To be able to individually adjust the contrast of the first picture signals, a D/A stage (10) connected to the output of the first picture processing stage (1) can be supplied with at least one variable reference signal (Vref) which is set by a control device (8) as determined by digital control signals. Furthermore, a device (30) for detecting an amplitude deviation of output current signals (IR1, IG1, IB1) of this D/A stage (10) from a predetermined reference amplitude and for correcting the output current signals (IR1, IG1, IB1) of the D/A stage (10) to a predetermined reference amplitude is provided.
