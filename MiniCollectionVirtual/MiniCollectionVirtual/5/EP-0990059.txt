<ABSTRACT>
A low temperature CVD process for deposition of bismuth-containing ceramic thin films (12) suitable for integration to fabricate ferroelectric memory devices (10). The bismuth-containing film can be formed using a tris ( beta -diketonate) bismuth precursor. Films of amorphous SBT can be formed by CVD and then ferroannealed to produce films with Aurivillius phase composition having superior ferroelectric properties suitable for manufacturing high density FRAMs.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a chemical vapor deposition process for forming bismuth-containing material films on a substrate for applications such as the manufacture of ferroelectric memory devices.In recent years, ferroelectric materials have been the focus of widespread interest as components of non-volatile memory devices.Non-volatile ferroelectric memory devices function by storage of information through the polarization of a thin ferroelectric material layer reposed between two plates of a capacitor structure. Each such ferroelectric capacitor is connected to a transistor to form a storage cell, in which the transistor controls the access of the read-out electronics to the capacitor. The transistor therefore is connected to bit-line and word-line elements, to constitute the storage cell.The ferroelectric material may be utilized in a stacked capacitor structure which overlies the top of the transistor. The transistor drain (e.g., of a MOSFET structure) is connected to the bottom electrode of the capacitor by a plug formed of suitable materials such as polysilicon or tungsten.Information subsequently can be changed in the ferroelectric memory cell by applying an electric field to the thin ferroelectric material layer to reverse ("flip") the polarization characteristic of the ferroelectric material. Ferroelectric memories (FRAMs), in contrast to dynamic random access memories (DRAMs), have the advantages of retaining stored information in the event of termination of the power supply, and do not require refresh cycles.In such memory applications, ferroelectric materials desirably have the following electrical properties: (1) a low coercive field characteristic, facilitating use of a low voltage power supply; (2) a high remnant polarization characteristic, ensuring highly reliable information storage; (3) absence of significant fatigue or life-time deterioration characteristics; (4) absence of any imprint which would alter the stored information (e.g., leading to a preference of a certain polarization such as a logical "1" over a logical "0" character) or otherwise impair the ability to "read" the stored information; and (5) extended retention time, for reliable data storage over an extended period of time.The foregoing electrical property criteria are satisfied in the layered pseudo-perovskite or "Aurivillius" phase of materials such as strontium bismuth tantalate, SrBi2Ta2O9. This strontium bismuth tantalate composition is sometimes hereinafter referred to as "SBT." As a result of these
