<ABSTRACT>
A composite asynchronous/synchronous system switches 
signal paths at the time of a fault and uses a route diversity 

function even when a fault occurs in the asynchronous mode 
signal. The composite system includes asynchronous system 

fault notifying means (31) in each of the connection offices (13A) 
connecting the synchronous communication system and the 

asynchronous communication system. When an asynchronous 
system alarm indication signal AIS shows suspension of the 

asynchronous mode signal or a fault in the signal, the 
notifying means converts a fault detection signal to 

information recognizable in the synchronous mode and sends the 
information to an asynchronous system fault path switching 

means (32) which is provided in the path termination office (13B). The 
switching means detects the fault detection signal generated 

in the asynchronous mode, or receives the fault detection 
signal sent from the asynchronous system fault notifying 

means, and switches paths formed on ring-like transmission 
lines.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to path switching at the 
time of a fault in a composite synchronous/asynchronous system 
comprised of a combination of a synchronous communication 
system and an asynchronous communication system. Until now, communication networks have been constructed 
based on an asynchronous communication system (stuff 
multiplexing), but in recent years a synchronous communication 
system (synchronous multiplexing), different from the above-mentioned 
asynchronous communication systems, has been 
proposed for the purpose of globally standardising the 
hierarchies in different countries. This new system is called 
the SDH (synchronous digital hierarchy) in Europe and Japan 
and is called SONET (synchronous optical network) in North 
America. Therefore, future communication networks will probably be 
constructed by a composite synchronous/asynchronous system 
incorporating a synchronous communication system in an 
asynchronous communication system. The present invention 
refers to a responsive measure at the time of a fault in such 
a composite asynchronous/synchronous system. Figure 13 is a view showing an example of the general 
configuration of a synchronous communication system. In the 
figure, 10 shows the synchronous communication system as a 
whole. As illustrated, the synchronous communication system  
 
10 adopts a so-called "ring structure" comprised of ring-like 
transmission lines 11 and 12 forming a closed loop. These 
ring-like transmission lines 11 and 12 have a plurality of 
offices 13A to 13D inserted in them (however, only four 
offices are shown here for simplification). These offices are 
called network nodes. A "through", "drop", or "insert" 
operation is performed for the path signal at each office 
(13). A "through" operation means the path signal running on 
th ring-like transmission line 11 passes through the office, a 
"drop" operation means that the signal destined for a home 
office is pulled in out of the path signal running on the 
ring-like transmission lies 11 and 12, and an "insert" 
operation means that a path signal from a home office is sent 
out to the ring-like transmission line 11. Note that there 
are a plurality of paths forming the transmission path of the 
path signal formed in the transmission line, the above-mentioned 
drop and insert operations are performed in units of 
paths, and the above-mentioned closed loop is formed for each 
path. Referring to the figure, as one of the intrinsic features 
of a synchronous communication system, mention
