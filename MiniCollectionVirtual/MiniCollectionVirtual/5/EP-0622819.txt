<ABSTRACT>
A temperature-controlled switching device having a switching function for temperature regulation, temperature monitoring or temperature limiting contains electrical connecting blades (6a - 9a) which are arranged in the form of a plug contact on an insulating base plate (1) in the depression in a housing upper part (5). One blade (6a), which is constructed as an early-make protective contact, is connected to the metal housing of a temperature sensor (11). Located in the depression as a coding element, so that only one socket housing, having a complementary coding element corresponding to the switching function, can be inserted and can be locked in the locking hole (13). As a result of the connecting plug, which in this way is integrated in the housing upper part (5) and is coded, the switching device can be connected quickly and correctly to an installation which is to be monitored. The arrangement of the connecting blades (6a - 9a) in a depression results in good electric-shock protection.
