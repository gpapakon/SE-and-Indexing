<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a filter for liquids with solid
particles in suspension, in particular lubricating and
cooling fluid in machine tools, including a filter element
having gauged openings that permit the fluid to pass
through and stop the particles to be filtered.The prior art involves settling tanks in which the liquid
taken from the machine tool is slowed to a velocity that
allows the particles in suspension to settle by gravity on
the bottom of the tank, the said tanks possibly having
staggered opposing vertical deflector baffle plates that
impart a sinusoidal motion to the liquid that favours the
sedimentation of the particles.The prior art also involves filtering devices for
lubricating and refrigerating fluid consisting of channels
in which the fluid is made to flow through evenly
distributed through holes in a series of plates positioned
transversely with respect to the direction of flow and
which are extractable to enable them to be cleaned
periodically; the gauged holes of each plate being
essentially of a constant diameter which is smaller than
that of the holes in the plate immediately upstream of it,
so as to constitute a series progressively finer screening
elements.Furthermore, as regards the settling tanks, the strata of
sludge made up of successive layers of deposited particles
needs to be periodically removed from the bottom of the
tank in order to prevent them from filling up with
consequent clogging of the extractor pump and causing
improper operation due also to the reduced flow section of
the liquid; this causes a considerable increase in 
maintenance costs and time.The devices with filtering plates placed transversely with
respect to the direction of the flow also involve costly
maintenance procedures to clean the plates, as well as
requiring the installation of expensive instruments to
measure the degree of clogging of the plates, which are
often not entirely reliable due to the make up of the
fluid to be treated, often not homogeneous and sometimes
including chemically aggressive compounds.The state of the art also involves filters in which the
liquid to be filtered is subjected to external forces,
such as centrifugal, magnetic or gravitational forces,
that act selectively on the particles to be separated.The centrifugal separators, the so-called hydrocyclones,
are highly sensitive to the density of the fluid and to
variations in the inlet and outlet pressures; furthermore,
such filters involve highly complex installations with
consequent high costs.With magnetic filters,
