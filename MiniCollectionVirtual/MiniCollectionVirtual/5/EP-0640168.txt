<ABSTRACT>
A bifold door (10) comprises door sections (12.1, 12.2) and a centre section (14), with a hinge construction (16) between each door panel and the centre section. Each door panel comprises an extruded metal section (18), and the part (14) is also an extruded metal section. First and second hinge elements (22 and 24) of synthetic plastics material have key formations (42 and 50) respectively, which engage with key-ways (28 and 34) in the extruded sections. The hinge element (22) has a pintle (44) and the hinge element (24) a bore (48) in which the pintle is received.

<DESCRIPTION>
More particularly, but not exclusively, the 
invention relates to a hinge construction for the type 
of door used in shower cubicles and referred to as a 
"bifold" door. Such a type of door comprises two doors 
panels which are joined to one another along a centre 
hinge. When the door is closed, the door panels extend 
at an angle of 180째 to one another. When it is opened, 
the door panels hinge with respect to one another about 
the hinge, in the manner of a jack-knife, to extend at 
an angle of 0째 or close to 0째 with respect to one 
another. In conventional doors of this type the hinge 
is formed by extruded aluminium sections which make 
metal-to-metal sliding contact with one another. A 
difficulty experienced with this construction is that 
it is not possible to coat the metal sections with, for 
example, the type of coating which is known as powder 
coating, which is very popular type of coating used to 
give extruded aluminium a pleasing appearance. The 
difficulty arises because surfaces which have been so 
coated do not slide easily on one another and would in 
any event wear off where the parts make sliding 
contact, and because the thickness of the coating 
cannot be controlled accurately enough to provide for 
the close tolerances that are required in a hinge of 
this nature. In more traditional hinge constructions 
gaps are left through which, when the door is in use, 
water can splash or otherwise leak. It is thus an object of the present invention 
to provide a hinge construction making use of extruded  
 
sections but in which metal-to-metal sliding contact 
between the sections is not required, and which does 
not leave gaps through which water can splash during 
use. According to the invention there is provided 
a hinge construction which comprises first and second 
extruded sections, a first hinge element having a first 
key formation and an axially extending pintle, and a 
second hinge element having a second key formation and 
an axially extending bore in which the pintle is 
received, the first extruded section having a first 
axially extending keyway therein and the second 
extruded section having a second axially extending 
keyway therein, the first key formation engaging with 
the first keyway to connect the first hinge element to 
the first extruded section, and the second key 
formation engaging with the second keyway to connect 
the second hinge element to the second extruded 
section. The first and second keyways are preferably 
formed in the first and second extruded

<CLAIMS>
A hinge construction which comprises first 
and second extruded sections (14, 18), characterised in 

that it further comprises a first hinge element (22) 
having a first key formation (42) and an axially 

extending pintle (44), and a second hinge element (24) 
having a second key formation (50) and an axially 

extending bore (48) in which the pintle is received, 
and in that the first extruded section (14) has a first 

axially extending keyway (28) therein and the second 
extruded section has a second axially extending keyway 

(34) therein, the first key formation engaging with the 
first keyway to connect the first hinge element to the 

first extruded section, and the second key formation 
engaging with the second keyway to connect the second 

hinge element to the second extruded section. 
A hinge construction as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised in that the first and second keyways (28, 

34) are formed in the first and second extruded 
sections (14, 18) during extrusion. 
A hinge construction as claimed in claim 1 or 
claim 2, characterised in that the first and second 

extruded sections (14, 18) are of an extruded metal. 
A hinge construction as claimed in any 
one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the 

first and second hinge elements (22, 24) are of a hard-wearing 
synthetic plastics material. 
A hinge construction as claimed in claim 4, 
characterised in that the first and second hinge 

elements (22, 24) are injection moulded parts. 
A hinge construction as claimed in any one of  
 

the preceding claims, characterised in that one of the 
extruded sections (14) has an axially extending recess 

(26) therein which is defined in cross-section by a 
semi-circular wall, the wall of the recess, for part of 

its circumferential extent, comprising a concentrically 
curved, thin-walled portion (30) of the respective 

extruded section, and in that the hinge element (24) 
engaging with the other extruded section has a 

concentrically curved slot (56) therein in which the 
thin-walled portion is receivable. 
A hinge construction as claimed in claim 6, 
characterised in that the thin-walled portion (30) 

extends through at least 90째 of the circumferential 
extent of the wall of the recess. 
A hinge construction as claimed in any one of 
the preceding claims, characterised in that it 

comprises at least two hinge assemblies (20.1...20.3) 
each formed by a said first hinge element (22) and a 

said second hinge element (24) cooperating with the 
corresponding first hinge element, and in that it 

comprises a spacer (82) separating the hinge assemblies 
axially, the spacer having a key formation engaging 

with the keyway (34) in one of the extruded sections, 
thereby connecting the spacer to the respective 

extruded section. 
A bifold door comprising a pair of door 
panels (12.1, 12.2) and a centre section (14), each 

door panel being connected to the centre section by 
means of a hinge (16), characterised in that each of 

the hinges has a construction as claimed in any one of 

the preceding claims.
