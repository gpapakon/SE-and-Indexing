<ABSTRACT>
A bath seat comprises a wooden sheet-like 
structural member (10) covered over its top and sides by 

a moulded plastics cover member (18) which is contained 
to define a seat (30) and other recesses (28). Four 

adjustable fixing members (50) are clampable to the 
underside of the bath seat to enable the bath seat to be securely 

clamped to baths of any shape.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns improvements in or 
relating to seats, particularly but not exclusively 
seats intended to be used in domestic baths. For many years there have been provided seats for 
use in or on baths whereby disabled, elderly and infirm 
people can bathe in relative comfort and safety. One 
form of bath seat comprises a board-like member which is 
supported on the sides of the bath and spans the gap 
between the bath sides. Seats of this nature are 
provided with temporary fixing means whereby they can be 
located on the sides of the bath. Different methods have been employed in the past 
for manufacturing such seats, for example, one seat has 
comprised a simple marine plywood board with adjustable 
fixing means on its underside. Whereas boards of this 
nature are relatively easy to manufacture they require 
careful finishing to ensure, for example, that there are 
no rough edges and to ensure that the coating applied to 
the board is durable and waterproof. Another form of 
manufacture utilised in the past has been to fabricate 
the seat from a number of plastics material components 
each formed by injection moulding or vacuum forming. Existing methods of construction have all given  
 
rise to advantages but in certain instances have been 
disadvantageous, for example, whereas the marine plywood 
board seat is simple in its basic construction the 
finishing processes required are time consuming and 
relatively expensive, thereby detracting from the 
original simplicity of design. Conversely the 
manufacturing costs for moulded plastic seats are 
relatively high but provide a relatively good finish. A further problem experienced with all existing 
boards is the temporary fixing means. It will be 
realised that these must be adjustable to accommodate 
different widths of baths, different bath wall profiles, 
bath manufacturing materials, etc. It is the seat 
maufacturer's aim to provide a fixing which is 
universal, that is which will be suitable for use with 
all baths likely to be encountered on the marketplace 
but the flexibility of design that this calls for often 
means that with some, if not all, baths the fixing means 
are either difficult to adjust, which is a problem for 
disabled users, or they do not provide a particularly 
secure fixing. It is an object of the present invention to 
obviate or mitigate these and other disadvantages. According to the present invention there is  
 
provided a bath seat comprising a main structural member 
formed from a sheet of material and

<CLAIMS>
A bath seat comprising a main structural member 
formed from a sheet of material and adapted to span the 

gap between the bath sides characterised in that a cover 
member (18) moulded from a plastics material enclosed 

the top face (16) and sides (12) of the structural 
member (10). 
A bath seat as claimed in claim 1, characterised 
in that the structural member (10) is cut from a sheet 

of plywood. 
A bath seat as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, 
characterised in that the cover member (18) has a top 

(20) with lips (22,24) downwardly depending from the 
periphery of the top, the top (18) and lips (22,24) 

being of substantially the same thickness, and the top 
being contoured to present raised and lowered areas 

defining a seating area (30), soap receiving areas (28) 
and drainage channels (32). 
A bath seat as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that fixing bosses (36) depend 

downwardly from the undersurface of the top and project 
partially through the holes (38) formed through the 

 
structural member (10) and are threaded to receive 

fixing screws. 
A bath seat as claimed in claim 4, characterised 
in that locating ribs (40) locate the longitudinal edges 

(12) of the structural member (10) over its central 
region lips (24) at the transverse edges of the cover 

member (18) locate the transverse edges (14) of the 
structural member and reinforcing ribs (44) depend 

downwardly from regions of the cover member (18) 
extending beyond the longitudinal edges (12) of the 

structural member (10). 
A bath seat as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that a guide rib (42) extends 

downwardly from the underface of the cover member (18) 
and is transversely spaced from the longitudinal edges 

(12) of the structural member (10) at its outer regions 
to define a channel (48) alongside the structural member 

and the cover member (18) is contoured whereby its under 
surface in those areas (26) alongside the guide rib (42) 

on its side facing the longitudinal edge (12) of the 
structural member is spaced above the upper surface (16) 

of the structural member (10) to provide a void (66) for 
fixing means (50). 
A bath seat as claimed in claim 6, characterised 
in that the guide rib (42) terminates short of the 

transverse lips (24) of the cover member (18) to provide 
a recess (64) in the assembled seat in communication 

with said void (66) for fixing means (50). 
A bath seat as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 
5, characterised in that four channels (148) with 

enlarged bases (146) providing a void for fixing menas 
are provided in two parallel pairs near each end of the 

structural member (10). 
A bath seat as claimed in claim 7 or claim 8, 
characterised in that adjustable fixing means are 

provided for the seat and comprise four members (50) 
each having a threaded passage (52) therein and a fixing 

bolt (60) threadably mounted therein, the fixing bolt 
(60) at its end (58) remote from the threaded connection 

with the fixing member (50) having an eccentric head 
(62) which can be introduced by way of said recess 

(64,164) into said void (66,166) where it is confined to 
movement along the void so that the fixing member can be 

located at any position along the void by screwing it 
down against the structural member (10) and/or guide and 

reinforcing ribs (42,44). 
A furniture assembly characterised in that it 
includes adjustable fixing means comprising a structural 

member (10) defining longitudinal edge portions (12) and 
a moulded plastics cover member (18) for enclosing the 

structural member, the cover member (18) along portions 
above at least part of the longitudinal edge portions 

(12) of the structural member defining a space (66) 
therebetween for the reception of a head (62) of a 

threaded member (60) to which the fixing means (52,56) 
is threadably attached.
