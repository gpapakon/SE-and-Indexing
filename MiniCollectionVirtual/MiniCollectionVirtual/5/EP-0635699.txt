<ABSTRACT>
Between the piezoelectric elements (16a), (16b) for 
driving and detecting and the piezoelectric element (16c) 

for feedback of the vibratory gyroscope (12), the 
oscillation circuit (30) is connected. By the resistors 

(32), (36), (38), the capacitor (34), the electrostatic 
capacities of the piezoelectric elements (16a), (16b) and so 

on, a phase difference of 90 degree is formed between the 
output signal of the oscillation circuit (30) and the 

driving signals applied to the piezoelectric elements (16a), 
(16b). The piezoelectric elements (16a), (16b) are connected 

to the input terminals of the differential circuit (40). The 
output signal of the differential circuit (40) is 

synchronously detected by the FET (46). The output signal of 
the oscillation circuit (30) is used as the synchronizing 

signal for synchronously detecting. The detected signal is 
smoothed by the smoothing circuit (52).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a detecting circuit,
more particularly to a detecting circuit for measuring an
output of, for example, a prism-shaped vibratory gyroscope
used a bending vibration.Fig. 14 is a block diagram showing an example of a
conventional detecting circuit which is a background of the
present invention. The detecting circuit 1 is used for
detecting an output of, for example, a triangular prism-shaped
vibratory gyroscope 2. Between two piezoelectric
elements 3 and the other piezoelectric element 4 of the
vibratory gyroscope 2, an oscillation circuit 5 is
connected. In this case, the oscillation circuit 5 is
connected respectively to the two piezoelectric elements 3
of the vibratory gyroscope 2 via resistors 6. Outputs of the
piezoelectric elements 3 are applied to a differential
amplifier circuit 7. An output of the differential amplifier
circuit 7 is converted into a DC output by a smoothing
circuit 9 via a synchronous detection circuit 8.By the oscillation circuit 5, the vibratory gyroscope 2 
bends and vibrates in the direction perpendicular to the
surface of the piezoelectric element 4. In this time, output
signals from the two piezoelectric elements 3 are the same
signal, an output from the differential amplifier circuit 7
becomes zero. When the vibratory gyroscope 2 is rotated
about its axis, a Coriolis force is generated in the
direction perpendicular to the vibrating direction of the
vibratory gyroscope 2. The vibrating direction of the
vibratory gyroscope 2 is shifted from the vibrating
direction at non-rotation. A difference of outputs is
generated between the two piezoelectric elements 3, an
output is obtained from the differential amplifier circuit
7. The output becomes the value corresponding to the
magnitude of the rotational angular velocity. The output is
smoothed by the smoothing circuit 9 via the synchronous
detection circuit 8, and an output of the smoothing circuit
9 is measured, thereby the rotational angular velocity
applied to the vibratory gyroscope 2 can be measured.However, the electrostatic capacities of the
piezoelectric elements change by an atmospheric temperature,
a change with time and so on, a drift signal is generated
from the differential amplifier circuit even during non-rotation.
The drift signal causes an error in measurement,
it is impossible to measure an accurate rotational angular
velocity. EP 0 477 540 A1 relates to a detecting circuit for a vibrating
gyroscope. The circuit includes a prism-shaped vibrator and
piezoelectric elements formed
