<ABSTRACT>
A new and improved compiling system (10) which can mass produce individually customized media, such as videotapes. High volume production is realized by matrixing synchronized system resources, such as videodisc players (71, 72), videocassette recorders (61, 62), and graphic generator units (74, 75). The resources are managed using a predetermined client/server model (12) of computing over a local area network. The resources are synchronized by supplying all time dependent system nodes with the same time base criteria, which in turn, is also utilized to synchronize non-time dependent resources.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DescriptionCOMPILING SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR MASS PRODUCING INDIVIDUALLY CUSTOMIZED MEDIA Cross-Reference to Related Applications This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Serial No. 07/324,896 filed March 17, 1989, now U.S. patent 5,099,422 issued March 24, 1992 entitled "Compiling System and Method of Producing Individually Customized Recording Media," which is a continuation-in-part patent application of U.S. patent application Serial No. 06/850,239 filed April 10, 1986 entitled "Personalized Feedback System Utilizing Pre- Recorded Media and Method of Making Same," now U.S. patent 4,863,384 issued September 5, 1989. Each of the above mentioned patents are incorporated herein by reference. Technical FieldThis invention relates generally to compiling systems and methods of mass producing individually customized media. More particularly, this invention relates to a compiling system that facilitates the mass production of individually customized media. Background ArtThere have been many types and kinds of compiling systems used to produce recording media, such as videotape recordings. For example, reference may be made to the following U.S. patent Nos. 4,941,040; 4,924,303; 4,918,516; 4,905,094; 4,863,384; 4,775,935; 4,745,549; 4,725,977; and 4,602,279. As disclosed in the foregoing mentioned patents, various compiling systems include data base memory units with prerecorded segments and segment processors for selecting and directing individual ones of the preÂ¬ recorded segments for recording on a desired recording media such as a video recording tape via a videocassette 

recorder. In this manner, customer selected segments of prerecorded materials, such as a plurality of music videos, may be retrieved from the data base memory units and directed to a designated videocassette recorder for recording the selected segments on the desired recording media.While such compiling systems may have been satisfactory for some applications, it would be highly desirable to have a new and improved compiling system which is highly efficient and able to increase productivity significantly so that a high volume of individually customized recording media can be produced. Increasing volume production has been expensive when using previously known systems. In this regard, it has been necessary to increase the number of system components, such as videodisc players, graphic generators, and videocassette recorders substantially to increase volume production. Thus, even though high volume production
