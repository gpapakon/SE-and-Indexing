<ABSTRACT>
A process for the preparation of an alkenyl-substituted succinic anhydride wherein the alkenyl substituent has a number average molecular weight of from about 500 to 5000 and the average number of succinic groups per alkenyl group is greater than 1.2 which comprises reacting a polyolefin having an alkylvinylidene isomer content of less than about 10 percent and a number average molecular weight of about 500 to 5000 with maleic anhydride in the presence of a free radical initiator at a temperature in the range of about 80  C to 200  C for a period of less than 20 hours, wherein the molar ratio of maleic anhydride to polyolefin is about 1.0:1 to 9:1, and wherein the half-life of the decomposition of the free radical initiator is about 5 minutes to 10 hours at the reaction temperature.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing
compositions which are useful as intermediates for
dispersants used in lubricating oil compositions or as
dispersants themselves. In addition, some of the
compositions prepared by the present process are useful in
the preparation of high molecular weight dispersants which
have superior dispersant properties for dispersing sludge
and varnish. Such high molecular weight dispersants also
advantageously impart fluidity modifying properties to
lubricating oil compositions which are sufficient to allow
elimination of some proportion of viscosity index improver
from multigrade lubricating oil compositions which contain
these dispersants.It is known in the art that alkenyl-substituted succinic
anhydrides have been used as dispersants. Such
alkenyl-substituted succinic anhydrides have been prepared
by two different processes, a thermal process (see, e.g.,
U.S. Patent No. 3,361,673) and a chlorination process (see,
e.g., U.S. Patent No. 3,172,892). The polyisobutenyl
succinic anhydride ("PIBSA") produced by the thermal process
has been characterized as a monomer containing a double bond
in the product. Although the exact structure of
chlorination PIBSA has not been definitively determined, the
chlorination process PIBSA materials have been characterized
as monomers containing either a double bond, a ring other
than succinic anhydride ring and/or chlorine in the product.

Polyisobutene with Maleic Anhydride: Mechanism Catalysis by 
Dichloramaleic Anhydride", Revue de l'Institut Francais du
Petrole, Vol. 40, No. 1, pp. 77-89 (January-February,
1985).] Such compositions include one-to-one monomeric
adducts (see, e.g., U.S. Patents Nos. 3,219,666; 3,381,022)
as well as adducts having polyalkenyl-derived substituents
adducted with at least 1.3 succinic groups per
polyalkenyl-derived substituent (see, e.g., U.S. Patent
No. 4,234,435).Commonly assigned International Patent Application

Having Alternating Polyalkylene and Succinic Groups"
