<DESCRIPTION>
 SORBENT FAMILIESTechnical FieldThe invention relates to families of affinity ligands useful in separations and purification of biological and other materials. More particularly, the invention concerns families of ligands which provide unique patterns of affinities among candidate moieties which need to be separated.Background Art Chromatographic separations in the liquid and gas phase are commonplace and exploit a variety of molecular interactions. One general class of chromatographic interactions exploits only a single generalized property, such as interaction with an anion or cation or a hydrophobie stationary phase. Another general category, generally known as affinity chromatography, employs ligands that interact specifically with individual targets, such as antibodies or receptor proteins. In the chromatographic mode employing ion- exchange supports or hydrophobic supports, the behavior of the molecules is generic with respect to groups--i.e. , certain groups of molecules will be readily adsorbed to cation exchangers, others to anion exchangers, others to hydrophobic moieties and the like. These chromatographic techniques generally require large numbers of partitioning events to separate the individual members of these groups. On the other hand, in the "affinity" mode, only a very small class of molecules is adsorbed to the affinity support and all other molecules are unaffected. Thus, this latter method is unable to sort out individualSUBSTITUTESHEET 

members of large classes of compounds absent a multiplicity of individual steps involving individual affinity ligands.Additional drawbacks of the foregoing conventional chromatographic methods reside in the difficulty of eluting the adsorbed materials in a biologically active form. Both the eluates from affinity chromatography using immunoglobulins, and those containing materials adsorbed to ion exchangers, show distortions in the molecular conformation of the contained materials (Ohlson, S. et al. Anal Biochem (1989) 1 9:204; Muller, W. , J Chromatoσ (1990) 510:133) .The foregoing forms of chromatographic separations can be thought of as "single mode" procedures wherein only a particular property, such as charge, hydrophobicity, or specific affinity for a ligand is made the basis for separation. There has been limited experience with "mixed mode" sorbents where a number of features of the adsorbing moieties are employed. Such approaches are described in U.S. patent 4,694,044 wherein random copolymers of amino acids are used as a chromatographic
