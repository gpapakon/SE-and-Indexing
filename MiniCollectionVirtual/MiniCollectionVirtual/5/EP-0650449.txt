<ABSTRACT>
A wrap-around carrier (10) with end panel flaps (28) that automatically close when the bottom panel flaps (42, 44) are set up for locking engagement. The end panel flaps (28) are foldably connected to the side panels (18) and to gusset panels (62) which are also foldably connected to a bottom panel flap. Upon folding the gusset panels (62) into engagement with the adjacent bottom panel flap, the end panel flaps are folded into closed position. The folded gusset panels are located between the bottoms of the packaged articles (B) and the bottom panel, thereby locking the end panel flaps in closed position.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a package according to the
preamble of claim 1 comprised of a wrap-around carrier
containing a plurality of articles. This invention furthermore
relates to a blank for forming a wrap-around carrier according
to the preamble of claim 3.Wrap-around carriers provide a relatively inexpensive but
effective means for packaging articles, requiring blanks of
only minimum size which are capable of running on packaging
machine at high speeds. A wrap-around carrier is formed by
first grouping the articles to be packaged in the same
arrangement they will have in the package, then wrapping a
carrier blank around the articles and securing the ends of the
blank together. By tightly wrapping the articles, and also by
having the bottom portions of the articles protrude through
openings in the side panels of the carrier, the articles are
contained in the carrier and prevented from falling out through
the open ends. For example, cutouts in the side panels are
employed to receive the flanges of cans and other flanged
articles while heel cutouts in the lower portions of the side
panels are employed to receive the heels or bases of bottles.While such measures have been successful in containing
bottles of traditional design in their wrap-around carriers,
new bottle designs do not always lend themselves to
conventional treatment. The trend to larger beverage bottles
makes it incumbent to employ carriers that are not only
structurally capable of supporting heavier loads but are able
to positively prevent outward movement of the end bottles. This
becomes more difficult when the bottle design is such that it
no longer includes a conventionally shaped heel which normally
would be held in place by a heel cutout. The packaging of 
bottles provided with petaloid bottom designs is particularly
difficult in this respect. In order to be able to employ wrap-around
carriers to package bottles and other articles whose
design makes it difficult or impossible to be held in place by
side panel cutouts, and to do so without danger of the articles
sliding out the ends of the carrier, wrap-around carriers of
the generic type have been developed which comprise end panels.
A package of this type is disclosed for example in US-A-3670950.
This prior art wrap-around carrier is comprised of
side panels foldably connected to a top panel and to bottom
panel flaps as is well known in the art. In addition, each side
panel is connected along an end fold line to an end panel flap,
which is also foldably connected along its lower

diagonal fold line (70) dividing the gusset panel (62)

into a first portion (66) extending between the
intermediate fold line (70) and said first fold line

(60) and a second portion (68) extending between the
intermediate fold line (70) and said second fold line

(64);
each gusset panel being folded about its
intermediate fold line (70) and second fold line (64)

so that one face of the second portion (68) thereof is
in contact with the bottom panel (12) and the opposite

face of the second portion is in contact with the first
gusset panel portion (66);

   characterized by: 

each gusset panel (62) including an opening (72)
defined by interior edges of the first and second

portions of the gusset panel, a portion of said lower
end edge of the associated end panel flap (28) and a

portion of the adjacent end edge of the associated
bottom panel flap (42, 44), the intermediate diagonal

fold line (70) terminating at the opening (72);
the second portion (68) of each gusset panel (62)
extending beyond the intermediate diagonal fold line

(70) of the gusset panel;
bottom surfaces of packaged articles (B) adjacent
the end panel flaps (28) resting separately on the

first (66) and second (68) portions of the gusset
panels (62) to lock the gusset panels and end panels in

place.
A package as defined in claim 1,
wherein:


the article (B) comprise beverage bottles having
cylindrical body portions and sloped neck portions;
the fold lines (30) connecting the end panel flaps
(28) to an associated side panel (18) are more closely

spaced apart at their upper ends than at their lower
ends;
the end panel flaps (28) include an intermediate
fold line (32) terminating at its lower end

substantially at the intersection of the fold line (30)
connecting the side panels to the end panel flaps and

the fold line (22) connecting the side panels to the
bottom panel flaps, said end panel intermediate fold

line (32) permitting the end panel flaps to more
closely follow the contour of an adjacent rounded

article;
the side panels are comprised of a main side panel
body portion (18) and an upper sloped portion (26) 

connected thereto along a fold line (24), and the fold
