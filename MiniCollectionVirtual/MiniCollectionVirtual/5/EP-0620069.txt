<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus to be applied to any machines which 
make it possible the actuation of said apparatus to be 

carried out of the same machine, in order to obtain 
the clamping/unclamping of the tool in the chuck, by 

realizing the necessary relative motion between the 
spindle of the chuck (24) and the rotary locking ring (19).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for 
clamping and/or unclamping tools in a chuck. By "chuck" that piece of equipment is meant which 
is generally applied to machine tools, but not only to 
them, which is used in order to clamp, or lock, a tool 
in order that the latter can be driven, generally to 
rotate, in a per se known way, by the spindle of the 
same chuck. Methods or equipment which enable the tool to be 
clamped/unclamped by revolving a locking ring, which 
makes a part of the chuck, causing, by rotating, the 
desired clamping/unclamping action by means of the 
closing of at least three jaws around the clamping 
shank of the tool, are already known. The rotation of 
such a locking ring is often made possible by the use 
of a purposely provided chuck key which, in order to 
allow the tool to be clamped and/or unclamped, must be 
entered into suitable seats provided in the body of 
the same chuck. In this particular embodiment, a risk 
may arise at use time if the chuck key is 
inadvertently left inserted inside its seat. Complex kinematic assemblies and ratchet gears 
are furthermore known, which are used in order to make 
the locking ring integral with the body of the machine 
tool. According to this embodiment, when the chuck 
spindle is started up by the same motor means of the 
machine tools, precisely this starting-up causes the 
action of tool clamping or unclamping, as a function  
 
of the spindle revolution direction. Clearly, the structural complexity of these 
assemblies makes the machine a less reliable one, 
above all when said units are applied to units which 
should transmit high torque values and high values of 
revolution speed (number of revolutions per time 
unit), and which are submitted to impacts and 
discontinuous operating patterns. Furthermore, the 
construction complexity makes said units delicate and, 
surely, more expensive to be manufactured. The purpose of the present invention is of 
realizing an apparatus which supplies a solution for 
the above cited limitations which inherently affect 
the equipment known from the prior art, with 
simultaneously simplifying and making safer their use 
by the operators. This purpose according to the present invention 
is achieved by providing an apparatus for clamping 
and/or unclamping tools in a chuck in which tool 
clamping means are present which can be actuated by 
means of an external revolving controlled locking 
ring, characterized in that between a housing 
containing motor means for actuating said chuck and

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for clamping and/or unclamping tools 
in a chuck in which tool clamping means are present 

which can be actuated by means of an external 
revolving controlled locking ring, characterized in 

that between a housing containing motor means for 
actuating said chuck and said external revolving 

locking ring, elements are provided for preventing 
said locking ring from revolving relatively to said 

housing in order to cause said tool 
clamping/unclamping means to revolve relatively to 

said motor means, with an element for enabling said 
apparatus to operate in clamping/unclamping mode being 

provided. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized 
in that said actuation element interacts with said 

motor means, in order to cause it to run at a limited 
speed. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized 
in that said actuation element is constituted by a 

pushbutton which, through interposed control element 
automatically enables/disables said locking elements. 
Apparatus according to claim 3, characterized 
in that said interposed control elements are 

constituted by an engagement lever acting between said 
external revolutionary locking ring and said machine 

housing in both clamping/unclamping directions. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized 
in that said enabling element comprises an engagement 

lever acting between said external revolutionary 
 

locking ring and said machine housing in both 
clamping/unclamping directions, and a pushbutton which 

causes the motor means to run at a limited speed. 
Apparatus according to claim 5, characterized 
in that said external revolutionary locking ring 

bears, integral with it, a toothing with which an end 
of said engagement lever gets engaged, with said 

engagement lever being hinged onto said machine 
housing, and its other end getting engaged with 

shoulder portions provided on said machine housing in 
order to interact in both its clamping/unclamping 

directions. 
Apparatus according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that with said external revolutionary 

locking ring, guide elements are integral in order to 
an element which is provided with a toothing and is 

axially translatable in order to get engaged with a 
complementary toothing integral with said machine 

housing, in order to realize said locking element 
under rotation conditions. 
Apparatus according to claim 7, characterized 
in that means are provided for automatically actuating 

said toothing bearing element between said two 
positions, and that said means are activatable by 

means of a pushbutton provided on said machine 
housing.
