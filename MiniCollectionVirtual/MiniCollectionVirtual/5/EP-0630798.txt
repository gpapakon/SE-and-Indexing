<ABSTRACT>
A pushchair has a frame comprising a pair of rear 
members (16, 18), and a pair of front members (20, 22; 32, 

34) having intermediate pivot joints (28, 30) which allow 
their upper and lower parts (20, 22; 32, 34) to pivot 

relative to one another between a first position in which 
they are in alignment with one another and a second 

position in which the pivot joints (28, 30) are displaced 
forwardly. A seat includes a seat portion (60) which is 

pivotally secured to the front members (20, 22; 32, 34) of 
the frame and has its rear end pivotally connected to a 

pair of telescopic struts (70, 71; 72, 73) extending 
between the rear members (16, 18) of the frame and the 

junction of the seat portion (60) and the backrest (76). 
The struts (70, 71; 72, 73) are at their minimum length so 

as to support the seat portion in a substantially 
horizontal position when the upper and lower parts (20, 22; 

32, 34) of the front members are in their first position.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a pushchair of the type 
having a folding frame comprising a pair of rear members, 
each of which has a respective rear wheel journalled on its 
bottom end, a pair of handle support members supporting a 
handle and each rigidly projecting from the upper ends of 
a respective rear member, a pair of front members, each 
having its upper end pivotally connected to the upper end 
of a respective rear member and having a front wheel 
journalled on its bottom end and a pair of bottom members, 
each of which is pivotally connected at one end to a 
respective rear member and at the other end to a respective 
front member, each front member comprising upper and lower 
parts which are pivotally interconnected by respective 
pivot joints which allow the upper and lower parts to pivot 
relative to one another between a first position in which 
they are in alignment with one another and a second 
position in which the pivot joints are further from the 
rear wheels than when they are in the first position. GB-A-770115 discloses a frame of this type for use 
with a perambulator. According to the invention, a pushchair of this 
type has a seat comprising a backrest and a seat portion 
which is pivotally secured to the front members of the 
frame and a pair of struts extending between the rear 
members of the frame and the junction of the seat portion 
and the backrest, the struts being arranged to support the 
seat portion in a substantially horizontal position when 
the upper and lower parts of the front members are in their 
first position. An embodiment of the invention will now be 
described, by way of example, with reference to the 
accompanying drawings, in which: 
Figure 1 is a side view of a pushchair in 
accordance with the invention erected for use and with the 
seat back in its upright position; Figure 2 is a front view of the pushchair shown in 
Figure 1;  Figure 3 is a rear view of the pushchair shown in 
Figure 1; Figure 4 is a side view of the pushchair shown in 
Figure 1 but with the pushchair frame partly folded; Figure 5 is a side view of the pushchair shown in 
Figure 1 but with the frame fully folded; Figure 6 is a side view of the pushchair shown in 
Figure 1 but with the seat back in a partly reclined 
position; and Figure 7 is a side view of the pushchair shown in 
Figure 1 but with the seat back in its fully reclined 
position. Referring to Figures 1 and 2, a pushchair 
comprises a one-piece U-shaped unit forming a handle 10, a 
pair of handle support members 12 and 14

<CLAIMS>
A pushchair having a frame comprising a pair of 
rear members (16, 18), each of which has a respective rear 

wheel (50, 52) journalled on its bottom end, a pair of 
handle support members (12, 14) supporting a handle (10) 

and each rigidly projecting from the upper ends of a 
respective rear member (16, 18), a pair of front members 

(20, 22; 32, 34), each having its upper end pivotally 
connected to the upper end of a respective rear member (16, 

18) and having a front wheel (54, 55, 56, 57) journalled on 
its bottom end and a pair of bottom members (40), each of 

which is pivotally connected at one end (44, 46) to a 
respective rear member (16, 18) and at the other end (36, 

38) to a respective front member (20, 22; 32, 34), each 
front member (20, 22; 32, 34) comprising upper and lower 

parts (20, 22; 32, 34) which are pivotally interconnected 
by respective pivot joints (28, 30) which allow the upper 

and lower parts (20, 22; 32, 34) to pivot relative to one 
another between a first position in which they are in 

alignment with one another and a second position in which 
the pivot joints (28, 30) are further from the rear wheels 

(50, 52) than when they are in the first position, 
characterised by a seat comprising a backrest (76) and a 

seat portion (60) which is pivotally secured to the front 
members (20, 22; 32, 34) of the frame and a pair of struts 

(70, 71; 72, 73) extending between the rear members (16, 
18) of the frame and the junction of the seat portion (60) 

and the backrest (76), the struts (70, 71; 72, 73) being 
arranged to support the seat portion in a substantially 

horizontal position when the upper and lower parts (20, 22; 
32, 34) of the front members are in their first position. 
A pushchair according to claim 1, wherein each 
strut comprises a lower part (70, 72) connected 

telescopically to an upper part (71; 73) so that the strut 
is in its condition of mini
mum length when the upper and 
lower parts (20, 22; 32, 34) of the front members are in 

their first position. 
A pushchair according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the 
seat portion (60) is horizontally slidable relative to the 

front members (20, 22; 32, 34) and the struts (70, 71; 72, 
73), and the bottom of the backrest (76) is pivotally 

connected to the seat portion (60) so as to be movable 
between a position substantially in alignment with the seat 

portion (60) when the latter is in its foremost position, 
and a substantially upright position when the seat portion 

(60) is in its rearmost position. 
A pushchair according to claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein 
each rear member (16, 18) is formed integrally with the 

corresponding handle support member (12, 14). 
A pushchair according to any preceding claim, 
wherein the two handle support members (12, 14) and the 

handle (10) comprise a single U-shaped unit.
