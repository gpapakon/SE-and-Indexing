<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an internal combustion engine 
having a direct lubricating system to provide direct 

lubrication of different spots of the engine such as the 
connecting rod journals of the crankshaft, the skirt portion of 

the pistons, the transmission gears and/or of further auxiliary 
equipment such as an air pump or air compressor. The direct 

lubrication system comprises a lubricating pump controlled by a 
control unit to supply lubricating oil in response to 

respective requirements of lubrication at the different spots 
of the engine.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an internal combustion engine, in particular two-stroke crankcase
compression engine, comprising a direct lubricating system having an arrangement for
lubricating the crankshaft connecting rod journal, a crankshaft journaled for rotation about a
crankshaft axis and having a throw with a bearing portion eccentric relative to said axis for
receiving the big end of a connecting rod, further comprising a first lubrication passage
extending transversely through said throw between an opening and an inlet in the external
surfaces of said throw, a closure for closing said opening, and a second lubrication passage
extending from said crankshaft connecting said connecting rod journal to said first
lubrication passage and intersecting said first lubrication passage.As is well known, most mechanisms that have moving parts
require some form of lubricating system. These lubricating
systems all have in common the necessity of ensuring adequate
lubricant for the components being lubricating for long time
intervals without servicing and preventing leakage of the
lubricant to the atmosphere.Internal combustion engines are typical examples of
mechanisms that require lubrication. The problems in
lubricating engines are typical of those of other
applications but in some instances the lubricating system for
an engine is more demanding because of the likelihood of the
lubricant escaping to the atmosphere. This is particularly
true with respect to two-cycle internal combustion engines
wherein the lubricant is not contained within a separate
lubricant sump and recirculated through the engine during its
operation as with four-cycle engines.With two-cycle engines it is expected that some of the
lubricant will escape to the atmosphere through the exhaust
system since the lubricant is not normally recirculated
through the engine. As a result of this difference, it is
desirable to accurately control the amount of lubricant that 
is supplied to an engine and particularly to two-cycle
engines. With such arrangements, it is necessary to insure
that the components of the engine receive adequate lubricant
for all running conditions but also that excess lubricant is
not supplied. The excess lubricant can escape to the
atmosphere or carbonize within the engine, each of which
causes its own type of problemVarious lubricating systems have been proposed for two-cycle
engines and some of these systems also have application
to four-cycle engines. For example, the lubrication of the
connecting rod journals on the
