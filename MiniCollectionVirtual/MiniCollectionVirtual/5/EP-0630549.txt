<CLAIMS>
Device (2) allowing recharging of the battery (3) of 
an intra-auricular hearing aid (4), including a holder 

(11) having a recess (12) which is able to receive the 
hearing aid characterized in that the recess (12) 

corresponds exactly with the outer shape of the hearing 
aid (4) and into which the latter can be inserted, 

and two conductor terminals (14) connected to a source 
of electric current and projecting from the wall of the 

holder (11) defining said recess (12). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in that the 
holder (11) of the hearing aid (4) is made of flexible 

material, such as silicone mastic. 
Device according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that 
the holder (11) and the conductor terminals (14) are 

placed in a case (5) provided with a lid (5a), this case 
including a socket for connection to the source of the 

electric current supply. 
Device according to Claim 3, characterized in that the 
inner surface of the lid (5a) includes a pad made of 

flexible material disposed so as to come to rest on the 
hearing aid when the lid (5a) is in the closed position. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that it has a single or double recess (12) according 

to the number of hearing aids (4) used. 
Intra-auricular hearing aid (4), usable with the device 
(2) according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterized in 

that it includes a battery (3) and two conducting surfaces 
connected to the terminals of the battery (3), each of 

these surfaces being such as to come into contact with one  
 

of the conductor terminals (14) of the holder (11) when 
the hearing aid (
4) is fitted into the recess (12) which 
is provided in the holder to receive it. 
Hearing aid according to Claim 6, characterized in that 
its contact surfaces are located at the bottom of two 

holes (19) made in its wall. 
Method of manufacturing the device according to one of 
Claims 1 to 5, characterized in that it consists of 

moulding the material intended to form the holder (11) 
around the hearing aid (4), in such a way that the holder 

(11) thus obtained has a recess (12) actually formed by 
the impression of the hearing aid (4) itself. 
Method according to Claim 8, characterized in that 
silicone mastic is used as material for forming the 

holder (11). 
Method according to Claims 8 or 9, characterized in that 
it consists, when the hearing aid (4) includes the two 

holes (19) made in its wall in such a way that they do 
not run into the interior of the hearing aid (4) and 

these holes are made with such a diameter and depth 
that they allow the conductor terminals (14) to be fitted 

and held in position on it, of fitting the hearing aid 
(4) onto said terminals (14), moulding the material for 

forming the holder (11) around the hearing aid (4) and 
the terminals (14), removing the hearing aid (4) by 

disengaging the terminals (14) from the holes (19), 
then making the holes (19) so that they pass through 

the wall of the hearing aid (4), the conducting surfaces 
then being positioned inside the body of the hearing aid 

(4), opposite the openings of the holes (19).
