<ABSTRACT>
Methods and compositions are disclosed for the 
treatment of malignancies in which a protein tyrosine 

kinase is associated. The malignancies may be treated with 
a gene transfer vehicle capable of infecting malignant 

cells, wherein the gene transfer vehicle carries a DNA 
construct comprising a DNA sequence encoding a protein 

tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase). Suitable DNA sequences 
include those encoding wild type, or carboxyl terminus 

truncated, PTPases.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is generally directed toward compositions for
use within methods for the treatment of malignancies in which a protein tyrosine
kinase is associated. This invention is more particularly related to cancer
therapies using DNA sequences encoding protein tyrosine phosphatase or mutant
forms of the enzyme.Despite enormous investments of financial and human resources,
cancer remains one of the major causes of death. A common characteristic of
malignancies is uncontrolled cell growth. Cancer cells appear to have undergone
a process of transformation from the normal phenotype to a malignant phenotype
capable of autonomous growth. Mutation of somatic cell genes is considered to be
a common primary event that results in the transformation of normal cells to
malignant cells. The malignant phenotypic characteristics encoded by the mutated
genes are passed on during cell division to the progeny of the transformed cells.
Various genes involved with transformation have been designated as oncogenes.
Oncogenes were originally identified as components of the genetic material of
oncogenic viruses. The homologous genes on human chromosomes are commonly
termed oncogenes or proto-oncogenes.Numerous oncogenic viruses appear to operate by encoding a
protein tyrosine kinase. This enzyme catalyzes the phosphorylation of tyrosyl
residues in proteins. Changes in the state of phosphorylation of tyrosyl residues in
proteins have been suggested to be involved in oncogenic transformation. The
identity of the protein substrates and the mechanism by which their
phosphorylation mediates phenotypic responses remain to be elucidated.Approaches to the development of cancer therapies have, in
general, centered on the use of characteristic differences between normal and
malignant cells. More specifically, comparisons of normal and cancer cells have
focused on transformation-dependent changes in the molecules residing at the
surface of cell membranes. These molecules include glycolipids, proteins and
glycoproteins. Certain molecules have been found to disappear or at least 
decrease greatly upon oncogenic transformation, while other molecules increase.
Despite advances in this area, treatment of cancer cells by targeting tumor-associated
cell surface molecules has met with limited success.Due to the difficulties in the current approaches to cancer therapy,
there is a need in the art for improved methods and compositions. The present
invention fills this need, and further provides other related advantages.Briefly stated,
