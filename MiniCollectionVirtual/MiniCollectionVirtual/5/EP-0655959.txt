<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of shaping gear teeth of a high performance
gear.High performance steel gears can be metallurgically treated by
thermomechanical means to produce high strength and accurate contact surfaces using
controlled deformation net shape finishing techniques.Highly loaded precision gears are normally manufactured by carburizing the
surface layers of low carbon low alloyed steel gears, and reaustenitizing the entire
gear and hardening by rapid quenching to below the temperature at which
diffusionless transformations occur that result in the hardened martensitic structures.
The hardened gears are then finished to net shape by hard finishing operations. A
method was proposed in U.S. Patent 4 373 973 in which a carburized gear is
reaustenitized and quenched to above the MS temperature, roll finished, and then
quenched to martensite prior to diffusional decomposition of the metastable austenite.
However, no specific process details or apparatus are described in that patent which
can accomplish this process.For ultra-high precision gears, an even closer control of the deformation
process is required of the material flow pattern, degree and depth of deformation, and
the metallurgical conditions of the gear tooth surface and subsurface layers. The
deformation mechanism related to a rolling process with a single rolling die results
in different material flow patterns on either side of the workpiece teeth, which can
adversely effect the behaviour of high performance gears. Further, gear roll finishing
using a single rolling die can result in excessive deflections in the workpiece support
spindle, which must be compensated for by prior machine settings.By use of two rolling dies positioned on diametrically opposing sides of the
workpiece, the material flow patterns as well as the high in-feed rolling forces can
be balanced, resulting in a better control of the deformation process.To achieve the austform-strengthening of surface layers of carburized parallel
axis gear teeth for high performance applications, both in-feed and through-feed 
motions are required between the workpiece and the two rolling dies in a coordinated
and controlled manner, and such a controlled deformation must be achieved with
surface layers of the workpiece maintained in the metastable austenitic condition. The
large in-feed and through-feed forces necessary to roll finish spur and helical gears
to the high dimensional accuracy require a rigid through-feed mechanism holding the
workpiece on a fixed axis, and
