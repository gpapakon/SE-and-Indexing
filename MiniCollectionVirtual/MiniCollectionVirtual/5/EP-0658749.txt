<ABSTRACT>
A liquid sensing apparatus for a fuel tank comprises 
optical sensors (12',62) contained in a housing (70), each 

sensor including a light source (24',66) such as an LED, 
and a light detector (26',68) such as a phototransistor. 

A prism (28',64) is optically coupled to each of the 
sensors (12',62). The prisms (28',64) being of different 

dimensions relative to each other. The light emitted by 
the light sources (24',66) will be refracted and returned 

to the light detectors (26',68). The amount of light 
refracted and hence detected by each of the detectors 

(26',68) will depend on the type and level of liquid in 
the tank and the output of the detectors (26',68) affected 

accordingly. The shapes and dimensions of the two prisms 
(28',64) are different, so that the first sensor (12') 

provides different outputs depending on whether it is 
exposed to (a) air or (b) fuel and the second sensor (62) 

produces different outputs depending on whether it is 
exposed to (a) air or water or (b) fuel. The outputs of 

the two sensors (12',62) are connected to a sensor circuit 
by a simple two wire connection. The circuit can provide 

a signal to indicate the type and the relative amount of 
each fluid in the tank.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to optical sensors for
fluids. More particularly, the invention relates to optical
sensors of the type used for fluid level detection and that
can discriminate different fluid types.Optical fluid point level sensors are well known. Such
sensors commonly use a prism having a conical tip. The prism
is transparent to a beam of light launched into the prism from
a light source (such as an LED). The light travels through
the prism towards a surface of the conical tip and impinges on
the surface at a determinable angle of incidence. The prism
is made of a material that has a refractive index such that
there exists a critical angle of incidence at which all light
is internally reflected to another surface and back to a
photodetector, such as a phototransistor. Whether such
internal reflection occurs depends on the refractive index of
the fluid to which the conical tip is exposed and the angle of
incidence. The critical angle is defined by the following
equation:
c = sin-1(n2/n1)
where n2 is the index of refraction of the fluid, and n1 is the
index of refraction of the prism conical tip. Thus, for air,
n2=1.00 and for glass, n1=1.50. Accordingly, for total
internal reflection the critical angle with respect to air is
about 42°. By comparison, if the conical tip is exposed to
water as the fluid, the refractive index of water is 1.33.
Thus the critical angle for total internal reflection with
respect to water is about 62.5°.By forming the conical surfaces such that the light
transmitted therethrough is incident at 45°, the light will
undergo total internal reflection (hereinafter "TIR") when the
conical tip is exposed to air (because 45° is greater than the
critical angle of 42° for a glass/air interface), but will not
undergo TIR when the conical tip is exposed to water (because
45° is less than the critical angle of 62.5° for a glass/water 
interface). By positioning a light detector to receive the
light that is internally reflected, the prism can be used as
a point level detector for the water level. The transmitted
light that is not internally reflected is refracted into the
fluid, as is well known.Note that for TIR to occur, the refractive index of the
conical tip is higher than the-refractive index of all fluids
which are to be detected (in this example, air and water).Such a prismatic sensor can also be used to detect an
aircraft fuel/air interface when the prism material is made of
a higher refractive index such as 1.65, because the index of
refraction for fuel is on the
