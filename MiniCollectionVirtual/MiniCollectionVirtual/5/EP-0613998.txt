<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a cooling device for an internal-combustion engine. This device is of the type comprising a main circuit in which the cooling liquid flows between the engine and a radiator, an expansion chamber (3) connected to the said main circuit and an engine degassing circuit comprising a pipe in which the liquid flows from the engine to the expansion chamber, this device being characterised in that the aforementioned pipe (1) emerges in the gas volume located at the upper part (2) of the expansion chamber (3) and in that the device comprises means (4) for promoting heat exchange between the liquid jet (5) leaving the said pipe (1) and the gas (G). This invention applies to cooling an internal-combustion engine.

Cooling device for an internal combustion engine, 
comprising a main circuit in which the cooling liquid 

circulates between the engine and a radiator (12), an 
expansion tank (3) connected to the said main circuit 

and a circuit for degassing the engine comprising a duct 
(1) in which the liquid circulates from the engine 

towards the expansion tank, the aforesaid duct (1) 
having its opening end located in the gas volume (G) at 

the upper portion (2) of the expansion tank (3), 
characterized in that it comprises at the opening end of 

the duct (1), a part (6) having such a shape that the 
jet is divided and dispersed within the gas volume (G) 

to increase the thermal exchange surface between the jet 
of liquid and the gas so as to bring the gas temperature 

mostly close to that of the cooling liquid and thus to 
increase the pressure of the liquid located in the lower 

portion of the tank. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the said part (6) exhibits a face (7) located in front 

of the end of the said duct (1) so as to be hit by the 
jet (5), the said face (7) having such a shape that the 

jet (5) be sent back while being divided. 
Device according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that the said part (6) exhibits a closed space (8) in 

which opens the duct (1), the said part (6) exhibiting a 
wall (8a) bored with holes (9) dividing the jet of 

liquid into a certain number of small jets corresponding 
to the number of holes (9). 
Device according to claim 2 or 3, characterized in 
that the said part (6) is fastened to the end of the 

duct (1).  
 
Device according to claim 2 or 3, characterized in 
that the part (6) is fastened to the expansion tank (3). 
Device according to any one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the duct (1) extends into the 

expansion tank (3) with its lower portion and comprises 
a vertical portion (10) extending substantially up to 

its upper portion (2). 
Device according to claim 6, characterized in that 
with the engine being higher than the expansion tank 

(3), the duct (1) comprises an opening (11) providing 
the communication between the liquid contained in the 

expansion tank (3) and the inside of the said duct (1). 
Device according to claim 6 or 7, characterized in 
that the duct (1) opens into the upper portion (2) of 

the expansion tank (3).
