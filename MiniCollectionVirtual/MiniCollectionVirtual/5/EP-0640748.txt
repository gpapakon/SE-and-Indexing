<ABSTRACT>
A two piece intake or exhaust valve for internal combustion 
engines comprising an inner and an outer valve which can be 

designed with orbicular heads. The inner valve including a stem 
of a smaller outside diameter than the outer valve. The outer 

valve including a hollow stem large enough to accept the inner 
valve, and also including a valve seat in the center of its 

bottom face to seat the inner valve. The head, or base, being 
equipped with one or more vents which communicate between the 

intake port and the combustion chamber and being releasably 
opened and sealed off by the inner valve. The vented valve unit 

incorporating an independent actuation means by way of pressure 
differentials created by the induction cycle, and/or directional 

inertia factors of the mechanically controlled valve element.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention here disclosed relates to a reciprocating
intake or exhaust valve mechanism, and primarily relates to
an intake valve for controlling the movement of air/fuel mixture
into the combustion chamber of internal combustion engines.In typical internal combustion engines the valves that
control the flow of atmosphere to and from the combustion chamber
are one piece, with one spring retainer, and various spring
control arrangements.Since the efficiency of this valve arrangement is a major
factor in the performance of the entire engine, many attempts
at maximizing the potential flow dimension of these valves have
been explored. Since a homogeneous air/fuel mixture is also
an important factor in the performance of internal combustion
engines, many attempts to use the one piece valve arrangement
in different ways to create a swirl effect have also been
explored. Increasing the flow dimension allowed by the valve
automatically increases the power of the engine. Creating a
more homogeneous air/fuel mixture also automatically increases
the power of the engine by breaking down the fuel into smaller
particles that can be more easily burned, which, more
importantly, increases the fuel efficiency and reduces the
environmentally harmful emissions of internal combustion engines.It is toward these fundamental factors of inproved flow
dimension (volume) and homogeneous air/fuel charge that the
here disclosed invention takes a giant step forward, by
accomplishing both at the same time. It further is the intent of the disclosed invention to
address other factors concerning early vented valve designs.
Vented valve designs, such as the type disclosed in U.S. Patent
#4,901,683, to Huff, integrate two valve elements in a manner
to accommodate full mechanical control by one conventional cam
lobe. This requires that the cam lift available be shared between
the inner and outer valve elements, which reduces the
effectiveness of the concept. It further imposes a lash liability
which requires a dampening stop means and can reduce longevity.
It further requires an extra valve spring retainer system and
oil seal for the inner valve. It further complicates manufacture
by requiring a through hollow stem for the outer valve. It
further complicates retrofit into existing head designs by
requiring modification to seals, valve guides, spring seats,
and rocker arms, etc.It is to these fundamental factors effecting the
performance, longevity, manufacturability, retrofitability,
and cost of vented valves, that the here disclosed
