<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to internal combustion engines and
more particularly to expandable chamber piston engines operating in an
open thermodynamic cycle.Automotive vehicle and engine manufacturers, fuel injection equipment
suppliers and, indeed, society as a whole, share in the desire for efficient,
effective transportation. The balance between combustion processes to
produce power, and those processes which create pollution, is best
addressed by enhancing the fundamental efficiency of the engine
processes.It is well known that the ideal Carnot cycle, in which isothermal heat
addition and rejection are combined with isentropic compression and
expansion, is the most efficient engine cycle for any given upper and
lower operating temperatures. However, the Carnot cycle is not practical
for an expanding chamber piston engine due to the very high (over 50:1)
compression ratio required to produce significant power. Nevertheless, a
practical process which could make some use of the highly efficient
Carnot process would be an advance in the art.The most practical engine, and thus presently the most predominant, is the
Otto cycle engine which includes a compression process of a fuel-air
mixture followed by unregulated combustion. It is well known that for a
given compression ratio the ideal Otto cycle is the most efficient
expanding chamber piston engine since the Otto cycle combines high
peak temperature with a practical average temperature of heat input. However, the high peak combustion temperature of an Otto engine can
cause auto-ignition of a portion of the fuel-air mixture, resulting in engine
noise and damage to the engine, as well as the creation of excess amounts
of undesired NOx.In the past, auto-ignition in Otto cycle engines was reduced by use of
chemical additives to the fuel such as lead compounds (no longer
permitted by law), manganese compounds (which cause spark plug
deposits to build up, resulting in misfire), benzene (the use of which is
presently being curtailed by legislative mandate) or fuel reformulations to
prevent deleterious auto-ignition while meeting environmental goals.
Auto-ignition can also be reduced by limiting the combustion temperature,
either through use of a lower compression ratio (which reduces both
power and efficiency), or by exhaust gas recirculation, lean-burn or
stratified charge techniques, all of which cause power loss.For general purpose road use, the engines of emission-constrained
passenger cars are presently limited to useful compression of
