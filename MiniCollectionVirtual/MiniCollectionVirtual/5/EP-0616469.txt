<ABSTRACT>
A television signal processing system (3) for performing a 
signal processing correspondingly to a kind of television 

signal determined from a number of television signals 
including an EDTV signal which contains a picture signal 

indicative of image information and an auxiliary signal 
related to and time-division multiplexed with the picture 

signal, the system comprises detection device (20) for detecting 
an input television signal supplied from a television signal 

recording and/or reproducing apparatus (1,2) and television signal 
processing device (103), when the detection device (20) detects the 

television signal supplied from the television signal recording 
and reproducing apparatus (1,2), the processing device (103) 

processes 
only an EDTV signal containing the base-band auxiliary 

signal as EDTV signal and, when the detection device (20) 
detects the video signal as supplied from other source than 

the television signal recording and reproducing apparatus (1,2), 
the processing device (103) processes only an EDTV signal containing 

a modulated or encoded auxiliary signal as an EDTV 
signal. A television signal processing system (3) is capable of 

receiving an EDTV signal composed of a picture signal 
indicative of an image information and two auxiliary signals 

time-division multiplexed with the picture signal and comprises 
a signal configuration identification circuit (111) for 

producing an identification signal obtained by identification 
signal configuration of various video signals which 

include the EDTV signal and are to be received and an 
interpolation circuit (105) for outputting an enhanced video 

signal obtained by enhancing the picture signal when the 
identification signal indicates the EDTV signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a television signal 
processing system. Prior arts will be described with reference to Fig. 10 
which explains an image of a letter box system and Fig. 11 
which shows a signal configuration of the EDTV (Extended 
Definition Television) system. A transmission system for transmitting a high quality 
image having a display screen aspect ratio of 16 : 9, which 
is compatible with a conventional television receiver having 
a screen aspect ratio of 4 : 3, has been studied. One of 
such transmission system is the so-called letter box system 
in which, when an image is displayed on a screen of a 
conventional television receiver, black portions are displayed 
on an upper region and a lower region of the screen 
and the image information is displayed on a vertical center 
with an aspect ratio of 16 : 9, as shown in Fig. 10 and, 
when it is displayed on a screen of an EDTV receiver which 
is capable of reproducing the image having an aspect ratio 
of 16 : 9 with filling the same aspect ratio screen, two 
auxiliary signals dd1 and dd2 corresponding to two vertical 
high frequency components or two horizontal high frequency  
 
components or a vertical high frequency component and a 
horizontal high frequency component are transmitted in 
periods corresponding to the black portions of the screen. 
In Fig. 11, cc indicates a picture signal of image information. 
As the auxiliary signals dd1 and dd2, signals have 
been considered which are the so-called VSB-modulated (vestigial 
side band modulation) signal
 
obtained by restricting a carrier or signals obtained by 
digital encoding. These signals are illustrated in Fig. 11 
and will be referred to as the EDTV signal hereinafter. In 
order to identify such EDTV signal, an EDTV identification 
signal bb is inserted into a predetermined scanning line 
within a vertical blanking period as shown in Fig. 11. An example of such EDTV signal is the "PAL plus" system 
which is under consideration in Europe. When such EDTV signal is to be recorded and reproduced 
in a conventional magnetic video signal recording and reproducing 
apparatus (referred to as "VTR" hereinafter), it 
pauses a problem that the auxiliary signals dd1 and dd2 of 
the EDTV signal can not be decoded by a decoder for obtaining 
high quality image due to the following problems (1) to 
(3) for reasons that in such a conventional VTR, the input 
EDTV signal is simply regarded as a normal TV signal thus is 
not properly processed therein. 
(1) The auxiliary signals dd1 and dd2
