<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an oscillometric
blood pressure measuring apparatus
according to the preamble of claim 1
which detects a pulse
wave of a living subject and enables a doctor to make a
diagnosis based on the waveform of the pulse wave.The waveform of a pulse wave produced from an
artery of a living body or subject provides useful
information reflecting the condition of blood circulation of
the subject. There have been proposed various diagnosing
apparatus which analyze the waveform of a pulse wave of a
subject and make a diagnosis on the circulatory organ of the
subject based on the analyzed results.Generally, the conventional diagnosing apparatus
employ (a) an arterial catheter which is invasively inserted
into an artery of a subject, and (b) a pressure sensor for
directly detecting a pulse wave from inside the artery.
Additionally, U.S. Patent No. 5,238,000
or, for example, EP 0 297 146
discloses a pressure
pulse wave sensor which is pressed on the skin of a subject
for indirectly detecting a pressure pulse wave produced from
an artery under the skin.In the first, direct pulse wave detecting
technique, it needs a skilled doctor to carry out the 
insertion of the catheter into the artery, and the arterial
invasion due to the catheter insertion gives serious stress
to the subject. In the second, indirect pulse wave detecting
technique, an exclusive pressure pulse wave sensor is
needed, so that the overall apparatus becomes complicated
and expensive. Also, it is more or less cumbersome to set
the sensor on the skin of the subject.It is therefore an object of the present invention
to provide an oscillometric blood pressure measuring
apparatus which detects a pulse wave of a living subject and
enables a doctor to make a diagnosis based on the waveform
of the pulse wave, in a non-invasive manner in which an
invasive pulse wave detecting device is not used.
This object is solved by the features of claim 1.The above object has been achieved by the present
invention which provides an oscillometric blood pressure
measuring apparatus, comprising (a) an inflatable cuff
adapted to be wound around a body portion of a living
subject; (b) an oscillometric blood pressure measuring
device which supplies a fluid pressure to the cuff to press
the body portion of the subject, detects variation of a
plurality of pulse amplitudes of a pulse wave which is
produced in the cuff in synchronism with heartbeat of the
subject while the fluid pressure of the cuff is changed, and
determines a blood pressure of the
