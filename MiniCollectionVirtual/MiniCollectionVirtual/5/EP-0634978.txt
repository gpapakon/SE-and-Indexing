<ABSTRACT>
The wheel (14) is comprised of a pair of wheel halves (16, 18) each having a circular member (64, 66), and a plurality of spokes (42, 44, 46, 48). The wheel halves (16, 18) are joined to extend between a rim hoop (74) and a hub shell (20) to form a wheel.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a spoked wheel
according to the precharacterizing part of claim 1.In recent years, participation in competitive cycling
has increased dramatically and has created a demand for
greater performance characteristics from cycling equipment.
It is generally acknowledged that reduced aerodynamic drag,
lower weight, increased rider comfort, low maintenance and
reduced cost are goals to consider when attempting to
enhance the performance of bicycle equipment.Conventional bicycle wheels are typically constructed
using twenty eight or more individual wire spokes. Each of
these spokes must continually break the wind as the wheel
rotates, creating aerodynamic drag. An attempt to overcome
some of this aerodynamic drag has been to construct the
bicycle wheel as a solid disc. Although these disc wheels
reduce the aerodynamic drag, rider stability and safety are
significantly compromised. If prevailing wind patterns
have any component perpendicular to the riders direction of
travel, as is most often the case, the disc wheel acts as
a sail resulting in a potentially dangerous instability
problem. More recently, several 
manufacturers have introduced one-piece spoked wheels
constructed from fiber reinforced plastic. These wheels
attempt to reduce aerodynamic drag by reducing the number
of individual spokes to three or five. However, in an
effort to maintain lateral rigidity, these wheels utilize
additional material in construction and weigh significantly
more than a conventional wheel of comparable size.
Additionally, the manufacturing processes required to
produce these plastic spoke wheels are quite complex.
Fabrication involves careful wrapping of fiber
reinforcement cloth around a foam armature or plastic
bladder, placing this assembly within a mold, together with
uncured resin, and applying heat and pressure to the mold
to cure the resin. This process is very labor intensive
and requires highly skilled production personnel. Also,
the disc type wheels and the plastic spoke wheels have been
described as lacking the shock absorption and resiliency of
conventional wheels, resulting in a more uncomfortable
ride. These disc type wheels and plastic spoke wheels act
to support a load on the axle through compression of the
spoke or disc sector between the hub and the ground
resulting in excessive rigidity. Conventional wheels
support this load through tension of the spokes above the
hub. It is this tension loading which gives the
conventional wheel its resilient feel. The spoked wheel with the
