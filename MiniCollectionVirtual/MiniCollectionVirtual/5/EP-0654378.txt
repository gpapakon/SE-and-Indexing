<ABSTRACT>
The wiper blade (34) according to the present invention consists 
of a blade 

lever (4) and a wiping string (3) held as extended tight on one side 
of the blade lever (4). 

The height of the wiper blade (34) is a maximum of a sum of a 
thickness of plate-like 

blade lever (4), outside diameter of the wiping string (3) and the 
spacing between 

the blade lever (4) and wiping string (3). The width of the wiper blade 
(34) is that of the 

blade lever (4). Therefore, the wiper blade (34) can be designed small 
as a whole. 
The mirror holder (11) has formed thereon a wiper blade guide 
consisting of 

as ascending slope (151) to lift away from the mirror surface (10) the 
wiper blade (34) having 

been moved to near its reverse position and a vertical wall (151) to 
land the wiper 

blade (34), having been thus lifted and reversed, from the lifted 
position above the 

mirror surface (10) onto the mirror surface (10) to a predetermined 
position where the 

wiper blade (34) starts being moved back. Thus, the wiper blade (34) 
can jump over the 

rainwater it has gathered by its forward movement and wipes it again along 
with new raindrops by its reverse movement with no trailing, during the 

reverse movement, of the rainwater having been gathered downward once by 
the forward movement, thereby permitting to effectively wipe away raindrops 

on the mirror surface (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a wiper blade for a wiper provided on an automotive
outside mirror having a mirror unit consisting of a mirror body and a mirror holder, and a
mirror housing in which the mirror unit is installed, the wiper comprising a drive unit provided
inside the mirror housing, a wiper arm connected to the drive unit, said wiper blade being
provided to be reciprocally moved on the reflecting surface of the mirror body by the wiper
arm driven by the drive unit, as well as to a wiper for an automotive outside mirror
employing such a wiper blade.A wiper blade as mentioned in the foregoing is known from US-PS-4 369 542.Generally, an automotive outside mirror comprises a mirror unit
consisting of a mirror body and mirror holder and a mirror housing in which
the mirror unit is installed. The mirror housing is fixed to outside a car body
by means of a separate mirror base or a stay or the like formed integrally with
the mirror housing. The automotive outside mirror reflects a scene behind the
car on the reflecting surface of the mirror body (will be referred to simply as
"mirror surface" hereinafter) and gives the rearview to the car driver.Some of the recent automotive outside mirrors are equipped with a wiper
to wipe away raindrops, other waterdrops or dust (will be referred to simply as
"raindrops" hereinafter) staying on the mirror surface and which will prevent
the mirror from positively giving the rearview to the card driver.The wiper of this type generally consists of a wiper drive unit provided in
the mirror housing, wiper arm installed to the drive unit and a wiper blade
fitted to the wiper arm. When the drive unit is operated, the wiper blade is
reciprocally moved over the mirror surface by means of the wiper arm to wipe
away the raindrops from there.A typical one of such wiper blades for automotive outside mirror wipers 
is known from the disclosure in the
aforementioned US-PS-4,369,542.
This wiper
blade will be described below with reference to FIG. 1. which
is a bottom view of a conventional wiper blade, in which the
mirror surface is regarded as the front side.In FIG. 1, the wiper blade is generically indicated with the reference
numeral 900. The wiper blade 900 comprises a rubber ribbon 901 which wipes
away raindrops on the mirror surface, a pair of backing channels 902 and 903
which retain the rubber ribbon 901, and a pair of stays 906 and 907 pivotably
holding the pair of backing channels 902 and 903, respectively, by means of
shafts 904 and 905, respectively and which are
