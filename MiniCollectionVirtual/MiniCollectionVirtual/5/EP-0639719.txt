<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a blind rivet having a rivet sleeve and a rivet pin (1) arranged in the rivet sleeve (3). The rivet pin (1) exhibits a head (2) and, beneath its head, at least one helical web (12) arranged on its outer surface (lateral surface). In the rivetted state, the web (12) forms, due to a prior rotary/drawing movement during the setting operation, a helical channel in the inner surface of the rivet sleeve. The object of the present invention is to make available a blind rivet which provides permanent fixing of the rivet-pin remainder in the set blind rivet. This takes place in that, on the rivet pin (1), between head (2) and web (12), a clearing edge (10), which projects beyond the outer surface of the rivet pin (1), is arranged transversely to the longitudinal extent of the helical web (12). During the setting operation, the clearing edge (10) at least partially deforms the helical channel formed in the inner surface of the rivet sleeve (3) by the web (12).

Blind rivet with a rivet sleeve (3) and a rivet pin (1)
which is arranged in the rivet sleeve (3) and comprises a

head (2) and beneath its head (2) at least one helically
extending web (12) arranged on its cylindrical surface, the

web (12) cutting a thread (18) in the inner surface of the
rivet sleeve (3) in the riveted state during the setting

procedure as a result of a previous pulling-rotating
movement produced by the rivet setting device,
characterised in that
 a broaching edge (10) projecting
beyond the cylindrical surface of the rivet pin (1) is

arranged on the rivet pin (1) between the head (2) and the
web (12) transverse to the longitudinal extension of the

helically extending web (12) and during the setting process
at least partially deforms the thread (18) cut in the inner

surface of the rivet sleeve (3) by the web (12).
Blind rivet according to claim 1, 
characterised in that

the broaching edge (10) is formed by a widened diameter
region (9) on the rivet pin (1), whose radial extension

substantially corresponds to the height of the web (12).
Blind rivet according to claim 1, 
characterised in that

the broaching edge (10) is formed by a widened polygonal
region (19) on the rivet pin (1), whose central radial

extension substantially corresponds to the height of the web
(12).
Blind rivet according to claim 1, 
characterised in that

the broaching edge (10) is formed by a keyway profile region
on the rivet pin (1), whose grooves are arranged as a

helical extension of the web (12).
Blind rivet according to one of claims 1 to 4,

characterised in that
 a plurality of broaching edges (10)
are arranged axially offset on a region (20) on the rivet

pin (1). 
Blind rivet according to one of claims 1 to 5,

characterised in that
 the web (12) forms a substantially
wedge-shaped, self-tapping external thread with

substantially sharp cutting edges.
Blind rivet according to one of claims 1 to 6,

characterised in that
 the web (12) is constructed as a
triangle in its plan view, whose apex points away from the

head (2) of the rivet pin (1).
Blind rivet according to one of claims 1 to 7,

characterised in that
 the web (12) is constructed as a
triangle in its side view, whose apex points away from the

head (2) of the rivet pin (1).
Blind rivet according to one of claims 1 to 8,

characterised in that
 a plurality of webs (12) radially
offset relative to one another is arranged on the outer

cylindrical surface of the rivet pin (1).
Blind rivet according to one of claims 1 to 9,

characterised in that
 the head (2) comprises a profile
projecting radially on the rivet pin (1).
Blind rivet according to one of claims 1 to 10,

characterised in that
 the region (9, 19, 20) supporting the
broaching edge (10) is arranged at a distance from the

underside of the head (2).
Blind rivet according to one of claims 1 to 11,

characterised in that
 the broaching edge (10) and the web
(12) are arranged spaced apart.
Blind rivet according to one of claims 1 to 12,

characterised in that
 the rivet pin (1) comprises an
intended breakage site (13) formed beneath the side of the

web (12) remote from the head (2). 
Blind rivet according to one of claims 1 to 13,

characterised in that
, on its end region remote from the
head (2), the rivet pin (1) comprises profiling (8) for its

accommodation in a rivet setting tool.
Blind rivet according to one of claims 1 to 14,

characterised in that
 the rivet sleeve (3) comprises a
radially projecting flange (4) and at its end remote from

the flange (4) a bore region (6), which widens in step
fashion and whose radial extension approximately corresponds

to the height of the web (12).
Blind rivet according to one of claims 1 to 15,

characterised in that
 the length of the bore extension (6)
is selected such that, in the non-riveted state, the web

(12) abuts against the end (14) of the bore region (6) and
the broaching edge (10) is arranged outside the sleeve (3).
Blind rivet according to one of claims 1 to 16,

characterised in that
 the head (2) is drawn in the riveted
state into the interior of the rivet sleeve (3) and is

enclosed in a substantially positive locking manner by the
end region of the rivet sleeve (3).
Blind rivet according to one of claims 1 to 17,

characterised in that
, at its flange end, the rivet sleeve
(3) comprises a constricted diameter region, which holds the

rivet pin (1) in position with frictional locking in the
non-riveted state.
Method for manufacturing a blind rivet connection, in
which an axial tensile force and a rotational movement are

simultaneously applied to the blind rivet by means of a
rivet setting device in order to set the blind rivet, so

that at least one helical web on the rivet pin cuts a thread
in the inner surface of the rivet sleeve bore,
characterised in that
 a broaching edge on the rivet pin at
least partially deforms the thread cut by the web in the

process.
Method according to claim 19,

 the broaching edge deforms or removes
the material from the regions of the inner surface of the

sleeve bore remaining adjacent to the threads, the deformed
or removed material penetrating the threads and sealing

same.
