<ABSTRACT>
A ring network, the ring nodes of which are constructed as add-and-drop multiplexers is formed by means of purely optical components. On the optical fibre lines connecting the ring nodes, optical signals are transmitted in wavelength division multiplex. In a ring node, the optical signals are conducted wavelength-individually in individual waveguides and can be optionally switched through or inserted or extracted. In addition to the operating ring, a monitoring ring is provided with opposite direction of transmission. In the case of interruption of the optical fibre lines between two ring nodes, a stand-by ring can be switched via the monitoring ring. A further development of the ring network relates to a doubling of the facilities within a ring node. In the case of an interruption within the ring node, a redundant path is available for an affected signal having a given wavelength.
