<DESCRIPTION>
 Title: Peptides immunochemically reactive with antibodies directed against hepatitis Non-A, Non-B virus.The invention relates to peptides which react immunochemically with antibodies directed against hepatitis C (HCV) and nucleic acid sequences encoding these peptides.The invention further relates to a method for the detection of HCV or anti-HCV antibodies in a test fluid, and to an immunochemical reagent and a test kit which may be used in said detection method.Non-A Non-B hepatitis which is most probably caused by the HCV virus is a transmissable disease or family of diseases shown to be virus-induced. It can be distinguished from other forms of viral-associated liver diseases, including that caused by the known hepatitis viruses, i.e., hepatitis A virus (HAV) , hepatitis B virus (HBV) , delta hepatitis virus (HDV) , and hepatitis induced by cytomegalovirus (CMV) or Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). NANBH was first identified in transfused individuals. Transmission from man to chimpanzee and serial passage in chimpanzees provided evidence that NANBH is due to a transmissible infectious agent or agents. Epidemiologic evidence is suggestive that there may be three types of NANBH: the water-borne epidemic type; the blood or needle associated type; and the sporadically occurring (community acquired) type. However, the number of agents which may cause NANBH is unknown.For the development of a specific and sensitive method to enable a reliable diagnosis to be made in various phases of the infection with NANBH it is of great importance to identify immuno-dominant viral epitopes of this type. The present invention is dealing with new peptides having surprisingly unexpected immunochemical reactivity with anti-HCV antibodies.The new peptides according to the invention are immunochemically reactive with anti-HCV antibodies, and characterised by the following amino acid sequence (depicted in the\one-letter code): 

 _ ? -A— X-]_— X2~ 3~ "*L— X5— Xg— E— F— X — Xg— Xg— B ( I ) ,in which A represents hydrogen, an animo acid or polypeptider Xl r X2 , X3, X4, X5, Xg, X7 Xβ and xg can be any amino acid; and B represents hydroxy, an amino acid or polypeptide; or a fragment thereof which is immunologically reactive with anti-HCV antibodies, with the exception of the peptide having the formula A-D-R-E-V-L-Y-R-E-F-D-E-M-B, wherin A and B have the previous defined meaning.The sequence D-R-E-V-L-Y-R-E-F-D-E-M (II) is part of the HCV sequence and is located in the ORF-region of the SOD/HCV C100-3 clone.

2. A peptide according to claim 1, that differs from the peptide having the formula A-D-R-E-V-L-Y-R-E-F-D-E-M- B in that one amino acid has been replaced by a different amino acid.
3. Nucleic acid sequence encoding a peptide according to claim 1 or 2.
4. Immunochemical reagent which contains a peptide according to Claim 1 or 2.
5. Method for the detection of antibodies directed against HCV in a test fluid, characterized in that an immunochemical reagent according to Claim 2 is brought into contact with the test luid and the presence of immune complexes formed between the peptide and antibodies in the test fluid, is detected, which is a measure for the presence of anti-HCV antibodies in the test fluid.
6. Method for the detection of HCV in a test fluid, characterized in that an immunochemical reagent according to Claim 2 is brought into contact with the test fluid and anti-HCV antibodies, whereafter the presence of immune complexes formed is detected and from this the presence of HCV in the test fluid is determined. 


Test kit for carrying out the method according to claim 5 or 6.
