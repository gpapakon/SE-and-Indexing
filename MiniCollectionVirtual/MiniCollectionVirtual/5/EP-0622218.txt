voltage drift in the high voltage driving transistor (48;Fig. 2). The writing head including a 

substrate (100) having a first surface (102) and a second surface, the first surface having thin 

film elements fabricated thereon, the first surface having a first region, a second region, and a 
third region (d1,d2,d3; Fig. 5), the first region including an array of writing electrodes (50), the 

second region including an array of high voltage transistors, and the third region including 
interconnecting circuitry (104) for connecting the thin film elements to a connector. The head 

also includes a first cover glass (106) fixed to the first surface (102) of the array covering the first 
region and a second cover glass fixed to the first surface (102) of the array covering the third 

region. Also included are a first side glass (110) fixed to the second surface of the array and a 
second side glass (112) fixed to the first cover glass (106) and the second cover glass (108) 

whereby a channel (114) is formed over the second region of the array where the high voltage 
driving transistor is located.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electrographic writing head assembly. More particularly, 
it relates to an amorphous silicon electrographic writing head assembly having a protective 
cover. Amorphous silicon, a-Si, technology has found numerous applications because of its 
low cost and compatibility with low temperature glass substrates. Using substrates with linear 
dimensions in excess of 30cm enables the fabrication of large area electronic circuits. Printing 
systems based upon lonography and Electrography have also been implemented using a-Si 
technology. For instance, US-A-4,466,020 to O'Connell describes an integrated imaging bar 
having both an array of photosensitive elements and an array of associated marking elements. 
As will become apparent, the electrographic writing system of the present invention is a good 
candidate for using large area technology and a-Si fabrication techniques. However, problems 
can exist when incorporating an a-Si device into an electrographic writing head assembly. The 
problems and their solutions will be discussed below. In general, the electrographic recording process, for which this invention is 
particularly applicable, includes the steps of forming an electrostatic latent image upon a 
recording medium and subsequently making the latent image visible. Figure 1 shows a typical 
electrographic plotting system 10 including medium roll 12, medium 14, writing head assembly 
16, toning station 18 and drive roller 20. Recording medium 14 is provided in web form and is 
payed out from roll 12 as it is driven by drive roller 20. Medium 14 has a dielectric surface which 
comes in approximate contact with writing head assembly 16 and a conductive surface (not 
shown) which is opposite the dielectric surface. Medium 14 may be a coated paper, a polyester 
based transparent film, or other suitable material on which an electrostatic latent image is 
formed. Writing takes place in electrography when the potential difference between writing 
electrodes 28 (also referred to as styli or nibs) of writing head assembly 16 and a biased 
complementary electrode (not shown) on medium 14 is sufficient to break down the air gap 
therebetween forming an electrostatic latent image. As shown in Figure 1, writing head assembly 16 includes substrate 22 on which an 
array of thin film transistor elements (not shown) and electrodes 28 are formed. Substrate 22 
may be glass with the thin film elements being fabricated thereon utilizing a-Si technology. 
For mechanical strength and protection,
