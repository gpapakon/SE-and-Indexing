<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing a tinted contact lens, which 
comprises dissolving a soluble vat dye in a monomer 

capable of dissolving the soluble vat dye therein, mixing 
the monomer having the soluble vat dye dissolved therein 

and other monomers, polymerizing the monomer mixture and 
processing the resulting polymer into a shape of a 

contact lens.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
producing a tinted contact lens. More particularly, it 
relates to a process for producing a tinted contact lens, 
whereby uniform tinting can be carried out at the time of 
polymerizing monomers. A method for tinting hydrophilic polymers has been known 
wherein a composition comprising a hydrophilic ethylenically 
unsaturated monomer, a reactive dye and a polymerisation initiator 
is subjected to a polymerisation. The resulting polymer 
can be formed into contact lenses (WO-A-9211407). Tinting of contact lenses is effective not only for 
protecting the eyes of users from strong light rays but 
also for cosmetic purposes or for handling efficiency by 
distinction. In recent years, researches for tinting 
contact lenses have been conducted from such viewpoints, 
and vat dyes have been used as main coloring agents which 
are generally believed to have the highest fastness and 
be excellent in the safety, from a viewpoint such that 
they are free from discoloration or elution of the 
coloring agents and they are physiologically and 
physically safe. However, the solvent resistance which 
is usually regarded as a merit of such vat dyes, leads to 
a drawback such that the vat dyes are hardly soluble in 
starting material monomers for contact lenses.  
 Therefore, for tinting with a vat dye, it has been 
common to employ a method wherein the vat dye is 
converted in a reducing bath to a soluble leuco form, 
which is then impregnated to an object to be tinted, 
followed by oxidation treatment for fixing. The EP-A-0 480 049 describes the impregnation 
of a polymer with a solvent mixture comprising a vat dye. As a technique in which the above method is applied 
to a contact lens, a method is known which is disclosed 
in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 
206453/1984. The method comprises immersing a water-absorptive 
plastic segment or a shaped soft contact lens 
in its hydrogel state in a dyeing solution containing a 
soluble vat dye to impregnate the dye thereto and then 
applying oxidation treatment to insolubilize the dye. 
Such a method is a quite common method as a dyeing method 
using a vat dye. In addition to such a method, a method disclosed in 
Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 173721/1990, 
is known as an example in which a similar method is 
applied to a water-absorptive soft contact lens in its 
xerogel state for the purpose of simplifying the process 
and avoiding color shading. Both of the above methods have a common feature that
