A beverage brewing apparatus (1) with a filter 
assembly (18) which is removable from a brewer housing 

(2) along a plane of movement (24) and includes an opening 
(25) open on top and defined by an upper rim (22), 

wherein the filter assembly (18) is adapted to receive 
ingredients such as ground coffee beans or tea leaves for 

preparing a brew, wherein the opening (25) of the filter 
assembly (18) is located under a cover assembly (28) when 

the filter assembly is fully inserted into the brewer 
housing, wherein the cover assembly includes a discharge 

port (47) from which a brewing water flows through the 
opening (25) into the filter assembly (18) and thereafter, 

in extracting its contents to provide a brew, into 
a vessel (12) placed under the filter assembly, wherein a 

predominant portion of the upper rim (22) of the filter 
assembly (18) lies in a first plane (23), wherein an area 

(26) of the cover assembly (28) cooperates with the predominant 
portion of the upper rim (22) and lies in a 

second plane (30), wherein, with the filter assembly (18) 
fully inserted into the brewer housing, the first (23) 

and the second (30) planes are vertically disposed in 
close proximity to each other and extend parallel to each 

other,
characterized in that
 both the 
first (23) and the second (30) planes are inclined relative 

to the plane of movement (24) by an angle of inclination 
(a). 
The beverage brewing apparatus as claimed in 
claim 1,
characterized in that
 the filter 
assembly (18) is moved along the plane of movement (24)  

 
by pivoting it about a pivot axis (32) arranged in the 

brewer housing (2) and extending vertically to said plane 
of movement. 
The beverage brewing apparatus as claimed in 
claim 1 or claim 2,
characterized in that
 only the predominant 
portion of the upper rim (22) of the filter 

assembly (18) lies in the first plane (23) and the 
remaining portion (54) of the upper rim extends below the 

first plane (23), and the cover assembly (28) includes an 
elevation (46) projecting from the second plane (30) and 

engaging the remaining portion (54) in a closing fashion 
when the filter assembly (18) is fully inserted into the 

brewer housing. 
The beverage brewing apparatus as claimed in 
claim 2,
characterized in that
 the angle of 
inclination (a) between the first (23) and the second 

(30) planes and the plane of movement (24) is between 1 
and 15 degrees, preferably 4 degrees. 
The beverage brewing apparatus as claimed in 
claim 1,
characterized in that
 the dimensions 
of the filter assembly (18) and the brewer housing 

(2) are selected such that, during insertion of the filter 
assembly (18) into the brewer housing (2), contact is 

established between the upper rim (22) of the filter 
assembly (18) and the underside (27) of the cover assembly 

(28) before the filter assembly (18) contacts another 
part of the brewer housing (2).  

 
The beverage brewing apparatus as claimed in 
claim 4,
characterized in that
 the brewer 
housing (2) includes at least one locking device (42, 44) 

for the filter assembly (18) which cooperates therewith 
through the intermediary of slots (43, 45) when the filter 

assembly is fully inserted into the brewer housing, 
thereby causing the upper rim (22) of the filter assembly 

(18) to be maintained in biased engagement with the underside 
(27) of the cover assembly (28). 
The beverage brewing apparatus as claimed in 
claim 5,
characterized in that
 a ring seal 
(70) made of an elastic material is affixed to the upper 

rim (22) of the filter assembly (18), or to the underside 
(27) of the cover assembly (28) in the area of abutting 

engagement of the upper rim (22) of the filter assembly.
