<ABSTRACT>
A bulb holder (10, 64) for a lamp assembly comprises bulb holding means (14) including 
electrical bulb contacts (36, 38), connection means (22) (e.g. a mating portion adapted 

to mate with an electrical connector) including electrical connectors (44, 60, 84, 86) for 
connecting the bulb contacts (36, 38) to an electric power source, and external 

circumferential sealing means (28, 34) for forming a substantially watertight seal 
between the bulb holder (10, 64) and the remainder of the lamp assembly (70). To 

minimise the circumferential length of the sealing means, the bulb holding means (14) 
and the connection means (22) are disposed at mutually opposed ends of the bulb holder 

(10, 64).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a bulb holder and has particular reference to a bulb holder for 
a lamp assembly, particularly a water resistant vehicle lamp assembly. The invention 
also embraces a lamp assembly including at least one such bulb holder. A typical vehicle lamp assembly comprises a reflector, a lens constituting a cover for 
the reflector and a bulb holder for holding a bulb with its filament positioned 
substantially at the focal point of the reflector. In order to protect the bulb and the other electrical components of the lamp assembly 
from moisture such as precipitation and road-surface spray, a waterproof seal is typically 
interposed between the lens and the reflector. However, with the advent of automated 
washing apparatus for vehicles which utilise high-pressure water jets to clean vehicles, 
there is a general requirement to provide a lamp assembly of improved water resistance 
which is able to withstand the intrusion of moisture from such jets. This requirement is 
particularly stringent in the case of lamp assemblies for large vehicle, such as lorries, 
as the water jets employed in washing apparatus for such large vehicles typically have 
a hydro-dynamic pressure in excess of 70 lb/inÂ². In order to meet this requirement, a bulb holder has been proposed which comprises a 
body portion which is manufactured as a single piece from low density polyethylene and 
defines first and second recesses disposed side-by-side and oriented in opposite directions 
one from the other. The first recess constitutes a bulb recess being provided with appropriate electrical bulb-contacting 
elements, and opens at a bulb end of the holder. The second recess is a 
connection recess adapted to receive an electrical connector and opens in a direction 
opposed to that of the bulb recess. The connection recess accommodates two spaced connector pins for connection with the  
 
electrical connector. These connector pins extend through holes formed in the bulb end 
of the holder and are connected at the bulb end to the bulb-contacting elements. The bulb end of the holder is formed with a circumferential flange disposed radially 
outwardly of the first and second recesses, which flange is formed with a peripheral 
channel adapted to receive a waterproof O-ring. The flange is also formed with three 
circumferentially-spaced fingers which extend longitudinally away from the bulb end of 
the holder, and each finger is provided with a radially outwardly directed lug. In broad terms, therefore, the proposed bulb
