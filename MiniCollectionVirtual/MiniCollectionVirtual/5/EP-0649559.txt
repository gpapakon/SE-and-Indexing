<ABSTRACT>
A testing arrangement (14) and a method for materials testing at lead-throughs in a cap of a pressurized-water reactor, comprising a flexible sword (85) which at one end is equipped with a probe. Since the lead-throughs consist of a first tube passing the cap and welded to it, and a second tube inserted in the first tube, the weld joint has to be inspected from below via a gap between the tubes. In order to do this by means of a manipulator, a pinching arrangement (32) is arranged, which by pressing the inner tube towards one side widens the gap at the opposite side so that the sword can be inserted. The pinching arrangement and the sword can then be displaced so that the sword and the widened gap moves around the inner tube, in order that the whole weld and its surrounding area can be inspected.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a testing arrangement for 
materials testing at lead-throughs, especially for control 
rods, in pressurized-water reactors, to a probe sword suitable 
for the mentioned testing arrangement and to a method 
for materials testing at lead-throughs. At a pressurized-water reactor in a nuclear power plant 
there is a dome-shaped cap, with cap lead-throughs for a 
control rod mechanism, which is detachably attached to the 
cap. In the pressurized-water reactor there are also, in the 
cap or in the bottom, other lead-throughs for different instruments 
and vent pipes, which are connected to a kind of 
expansion vessel in the shape of an external pressure vessel 
with a water column. A lead-through for a control rod consists of a tube passing 
through the cap, which tube is welded to the cap at its lower 
side. The lead-through ends at the inside of the cap with a 
downward inner conical opening having a cone angle of a few 
degrees, normally about 3 degrees. In the lead-through 
there is an essentially coaxial tubular sleeve, which ends 
with a downward essentially funnel-shaped end-piece. The 
lead-through sleeve is at a seat at the top sealingly joined 
to the projecting end of the tube. Between the tube and the 
sleeve, there is a gap with a nominal width of a few millimetres, 
normally about 3 mm. The purpose of the interior 
sleeve in a control rod lead-through is to make the longitudinal 
axis of the lead-through opening adjustable in relation 
to axial openings in means located inside the reactor. 
Therefore, the annular gap does not normally have equal width 
around the sleeve, due to the fact that it is used as a 
trimming allowance. In a cap, there is normally a total of 
about 60-75 control rod lead-throughs.  
 It has been found that leakage can arise at the control rod 
lead-throughs and that the leakage is due to cracks in the 
tubes of the lead-throughs, more particularly in the area 
close to the weld that connects a tube with the cap. If there 
is a crack in the tube above the weld, water can come up on 
the outside of the cap when the reactor is pressurized, while 
a crack below the weld is less dangerous since it does not 
give any external leakage. For the sake of security, it is 
necessary to test the material at the lead-throughs in order 
to detect cracks and determine their characteristics, such as 
size, position and orientation. According to prior art, inspection of a reactor cap is carried 
out by dismounting the cap with the control rod mechanism
