<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a self-adjusting mechanism 
for fixing to each other the picture tube (1) of a TV set 

or monitor and the case (2). The case (2) is provided with 
a fixing sleeve (4) in register with the mounting lugs (3), 

in which a wedge bolt (5) known per se has been inserted, 
the threaded projecting end whereof is carried through the 

holes of the mounting lugs (3) of the picture tube (1), and 
a nut being screwed thereon so that when the nut is 

tightened, the conically widening inner end of the bolt 
will urge an elastic friction sleeve, tightly encircling 

the bolt, against the inner surface of the fixing sleeve 
(4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a self-adjusting mechanism
for fixing the picture tube of a TV set or monitor to the
case thereof without clearance, whereat the distance between
the fixing points may vary.As a rule, the picture tube is in general fixed with screws
directly to the TV set/monitor case. Endeavours are made
to solve the problem of tolerance by precise dimensioning.
Such conventional screw mounting is not self-adjusting,
whereby a gap between the picture tube and the case often
becomes a problem.Fixing means assemblies with movable components are also
known in the art. The EP-A-0 302 026 document discloses a
self-adjusting means for locking two objects together when
the distance between the fixing points of the objects is
variable. The means of said reference comprises a tubular
piece 14 and a cylindrical piece 26 which is slidable and
non-rotatable within the piece 14. In said patent, elastic
members 40,52 are used, with the aid of which the piece 26
can be lifted against a bracket 12. The parts to be joined
are secured to each other with a screw 38 establishing a
junction between the pieces 26 and 14. The fixing force is
achieved with screws so that the screw becomes fixed both
to the case and to the movable parts, thereby locking the
picture tube in place. The problem embarrassing said means
is lack of reliability, nor is it applicable owing to the
dimensioning required in association with current design
products. Moreover, the means of the reference is complex
and includes a number of separate parts, making the
manufacturing costly and cumbersome.WO-A-8606447 describes a fixing system consisting of a metal
anchor bolt and a metal sleeve for securing a workpiece to
concrete or the like. The workpiece according to this 
document is mounted flat to the concrete. Self-adjustment of
the mounting distance between workpiece and concrete, which
is desirable when the workpiece has 3 or more fixing points
and when the fixing points of the workpiece are not exactly
on one and the same level or when the concrete surface is not
absolutely flat, is not described. Furthermore, the
combination of a pin with an expansion portion and a sleeve
as described in WO-A-8606447 is not suitable for softer
materials such as thermoplastic resin especially when such
material only has a wall thickness in the same order of
magnitude as the pin diameter or even smaller.FR-A-2 590 633 describes a solution with a metal screw, a
plastic "nut" with an expansion portion and a metal cap with
protruding flanges covering part
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A self-adjusting mechanism for fixing to each other the
picture tube (1) and the case (2) of a TV set or monitor,

fixing members in the picture tube (1) incorporating
projecting mounting lugs (3), characterized in that the case

(2) is provided with a fixing sleeve (4) in register with each
mounting lug (3) of the picture tube (1), in which sleeve a wedge

bolt (5) consisting of a bolt (6) with a conically widening
inner end (11) and an elastic friction sleeve (7) tightly

encircling the bolt (6) has been inserted, the threaded outer
bolt end being carried through a hole in the mounting lug

(3) of the picture tube (1), and a nut (9) is screwed
thereon so that when the nut is tightened, the conically

widening inner end (11) of the bolt (6) will first pull the
wedge bolt (5) towards the mounting lug until the friction

sleeve touches the mounting lug and then urge the elastic
friction sleeve (7) against the inner surface of the fixing

sleeve (4).
Mechanism according to claim 1, characterized in that the
friction sleeve (7) is made of material having good friction

properties, particularly of rubber.
Mechanism according to claim 2, characterized in that the
outer surface of the friction sleeve (7) has been treated in

a manner adding to its friction.
Mechanism according to claim 1, characterized in that
around the fixing sleeve (4), adjacent to the upper part

thereof, a stop ring (10) is provided.
Mechanism according to claim 1, characterized in that the
conically widening inner end (11) of the bolt (6), when being

urged against the inner surface of the fixing sleeve (4) of
the elastic friction sleeve (7), tightly encircling the bolt

(6), produces a deformation (12) in the lower part of the
fixing sleeve (4). 
Mechanism according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the depth of the fixing sleeve (4) is

substantially consistent with the length of the friction
sleeve (7).
