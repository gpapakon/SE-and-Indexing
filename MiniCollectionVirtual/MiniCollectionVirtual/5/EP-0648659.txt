<ABSTRACT>
The purpose of the guiding system applicable to a four-wheel 
bogie with variable gap between is to guide the two bogies of 

independent and displaceable wheels (10) with which the body of a 
conventional railway passenger coach or freight wagon is 

fitted. 
The guiding system can be performed with a center balancer disposed in the 
middle of the coach body or, in a second embodiment, with an independent 

guiding system for each of the bogies, being constituted by a balancer (36), 
the turning axle of which is integral with a center frame (1) disposed on 

each bogie, and a bar (37) is joined to the upper end of the balancer (36), 
the other end of which is united to a support (38) which is integral with 

the coach body, the lower end of the balancer (36) having a bar (39) joined 
to it, the opposite end of which is integral with the outside case of an 

oscillant fork (6) which, in turn, is integral with a frame (4) carrying the 
rolling assemblies, the balancer (36) having other joint (40) located above 

its turning axle and disposed equidistant from a lower joint with regard to 
the turning axle of the balancer, the bars (41) and (42) being united to this 

joint (40).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a four-wheel bogie equipped with
a guiding system as per the preamble of claims 1 and 2,
the obvious purpose of said guiding system being
to eliminate the inherent dynamic effects in this type of bogies
equipped with independent wheels, so reducing the wear of the
tread, specially that of the rim, the steering and conditioning
of the brake for both gages being common, not requiring any other
additional operation for being adapted to one and other gage.This inventions applies to the railway industry.It is well known the problem posed by difference of gage existing
between railway networks in the passenger and goods transportation,
which has given rise to several surveys and solutions
in order to avoid inconveniences in the passenger and goods transhipment.Nevertheless, up to date, no solutions have been given which
satisfactorily solve this problem, specially in the adaptation
of passenger coaches or freight wagons with bogies of conventional
type.One of the present solutions lies in a full replacement of the
bogies, for which it is necessary to lift up the coach bodies, 
after uncoupling the damping or mechanical elements between body
and bogie, as well as the brake system, the electric mass braids,
and so on, which represents a series of laborious operations.Also, other devices have been adopted in order to obtain a
shaft with a variable gap between wheels by a displacement on
the shaft body, so that the same safety, toughness, etc. securities
as the shaft pressed wheels according to the typical system
are obtained.Further, if it is mandatory to carry out automatically the
change in a short interval of time, and to travel distances large
enough under perfect operating conditions without stopping at
a maintenance workshop, it is difficult to get a mechanism meeting
all these requirements in a practical field.An obvious solution to the present problems in this matter -
would be to rely firstly on a bogie not only fitted with displaceable
and independent wheels allowing it to run on different
gages, but also that its frame, fitted with said wheels, should
be so designed that its wheels were guided and oriented when the
vehicle carrying this type of bogies would run on the track following
a curve.Likewise, in this intended solution, it should be contemplated
that the guiding system could be also applicable to a bogie fitted
with independent wheels having a fixed width, but not displaceable,
to be able to run on different gages.It should be pointed out, in a specific manner,

A four-wheel bogie equipped with a guiding
system for a two-bogie railway coach, the bogie being

provided with independent wheels that have a variable
gap between them, and comprising a center frame (1)

and four rolling assemblies, each of which is composed
of a half-shaft (9), a wheel (10), brake disks

(11) attached to each other and bearing boxes (12)
mounted on each end of the half-shaft (9), characterized

by further comprising:

two identical sub-frames (4) carrying the
rolling assemblies and being each rotatably joined to

the center frame,
one on each side of said center frame (1) by means of a joint (2);
two pairs of arms connected to each subframe
(4) by means of a joint (5) and determining two

oscillating forks (6), each of which carries, at the
end of its arms, a housing case adapted to receive a

bearing box (12); and, on either side of the two-bogie
railway coach:

of the coach body, the turning axle of said balancer

being attached to the frame of the coach body;
a pair of second balancers (36) the turning
axles of which are located below the geometrical

center thereof and attached to the center frame (1)
of the respective bogies of the railway coach; and
two sets of first, second, third and fourth
bars (37, 39, 41, 42),
