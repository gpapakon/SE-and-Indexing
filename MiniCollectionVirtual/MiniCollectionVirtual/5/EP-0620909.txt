<ABSTRACT>
A regenerator is provided which has an annular heat-storage medium composed of bulk material (16) and disposed between two coaxial cylindrical gratings (2 and 3, respectively), a hot collecting chamber (4) enclosed by the inner, hot grating (3) and a cold collecting chamber (6) enclosed between the outer, cold grating (2), on the one hand, and the housing wall (1) of the regenerator, on the other, in which regenerator the hot collecting chamber (4) is closed off by a lid (9) resting on the upper rim of the hot grating (3) and there is provided, at a distance above the lid (9), a shield (11) which is attached to the housing wall (1) of the regenerator and is not physically linked to the lid (9).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a regenerator having an 
annular heat-storage medium composed of bulk material and 
disposed between two coaxial cylindrical gratings, a hot 
collecting chamber enclosed by the inner, hot grating and 
a cold collecting chamber enclosed between the outer, 
cold grating, on the one hand, and the housing wall of 
the regenerator, on the other. Such a regenerator is disclosed in US-PS 
2,272,108. In the embodiment of the regenerator described 
in this publication, the hot collecting chamber is 
constructed with an open top and discharges into an 
outlet, provided in the upper part of the housing wall or 
in the roof of the regenerator, for the hot gases 
produced during the cold blasting. The roof of the regenerator also spans the 
annular chamber, concentrically disposed around the hot 
collecting chamber, for the heat-storage medium, which is 
disposed between cold and hot grating. The heat-storage 
medium is composed of a bulk material having a particle 
size of 25 to 100 mm. Provided in the outside wall or the 
roof of the regenerator are openings through which the 
bulk material can be poured into the annular chamber. The roof of the regenerator rests on the vertical 
housing wall of the regenerator, and specifically with 
the interposition of a ring beam for absorbing the 
thrust forces. The annular chamber formed by the outer grating, 
on the one hand, and the housing wall of the regenerator, 
on the other, serves as collecting chamber for the cooled 
exhaust gases during the heating-up phase, but during the 
blast phase it serves to distribute the cold blast over 
the circumference of the regenerator or of the heat-storage 
medium. The result of this construction is that 
almost the entire outside skin of the regenerator comes 
into contact only with cold gas and a thermal insulation 
is therefore unnecessary. The coaxially disposed inner, hot grating forms 
the boundary, on the one hand, of the hot side of the  
 
annular heat-storage bed and, on the other, of the 
cylindrical collecting chamber for the heated blast or it 
forms the distribution chamber for hot combustion gases. 
Said collecting chamber and, consequently, also the inner 
grating are permanently at high temperature and can 
therefore be constructed only from ceramic refractory 
components, but said ceramic components must provide an 
adequate permeability for the gases passing through. In 
particular, the use of bulk material having very small 
particle sizes as heat-storage medium implies that these 
compone

A regenerator having an annular heat-storage 
medium composed of bulk material and disposed between two 

coaxial cylindrical gratings (2, 3), a hot collecting chamber (4)
