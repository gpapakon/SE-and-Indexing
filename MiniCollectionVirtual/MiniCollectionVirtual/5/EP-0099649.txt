<ABSTRACT>
An end closure for a liquid-carrying container and a 
blank for constructing same, wherein the end closure 

arrangement is adaptable as either a bottom closure or a top 
closure. It includes improved score line configurations for 

assuring that the end closure outer surface is square with the 
container side walls. It further includes panels which, when 

folded, result in a full, unscored outer panel extending 
completely across the end of the container.

 END CLOSURE FOR LIQUID CONTAINER
 Technical Field
 This invention relates generally to thermoplastic coated paperboard containers and blanks for constructing   sanie    and, more particularly, to a folded end closure   therefor   
 Background Art
 Containers for beverages such as milk and juices are conventionally constructed from   theo oplastic    coated   paperboard    One: type of these containers   includes    a top end closure with a folded. gable roof having   a    vertically   projecting    seal at the roof ridge for   sealing      the      container   
Such containers are shown by   U.S.    Patent No. 3,270,940.
The bottom end closure for same is   conventionally of    the   inzolded    type, such as that shown by U. S. Patent
No. 3,120,335.


 Another type or container. includes a slant top or a flat top end closure wherein what could otherwise be a   vertically    projecting seal, or a slanted seal, may be folded flat and releasably secured to the rest of the closure.


U.S. Patents   3,869,078    and 4,211,357   disclose    such slant and/or flat top closures.


 Various techniques have been employed to enhance   te   
   folding    of a seal fin in one particular direction. For example, in U.S. Patent No.   4,078,715    there is disclosed a top end closure with an inclined seal that includes a
 "harder creases on one side of the seal than or the cthe
   -or    facilitating folding of the seal.   -ram      c      vertical      position    to the inclined position.


 U.S. Patent Nos. 4,012,997 and   4,093,115    disclose a
 container folding method and the container made by   tre        Zmethoc,    wherein one side of the gable panels of the top end closure is provided with double score lines extending parallel to each other. Folding of a top seal of the end closure from a vertical position to a flat position requires the application of a downward force along the lower double score line on one side of the top seal and the application of another force to bend the top seal   downwardly.   


 In U.S. Patent No. 4,206,867, a wide score line is formed on one side of the gable panels, in lieu of the above mentioned double score lines, with a conventional score line on the   opposite    side providing unecual fold-back   panels    on the two sides to facilitate folding the top seal from a   vertical    position in a direction toward the smaller fold-back panels.


 In the above mentioned   U.S    Patent   No.      4,211,357,    unequal angles at the base of the infolded gable or gusset panels,

CLAIMS



1. A flat end container comprising body panels including four side panels; end closure panels connected to the respective ends of the four body panels, the end closure panels including oppositely disposed gusset panels respectively connected by a first set of score lines to the ends of oppositely disposed body panels, and oppositely disposed rectangular panels respectively connected by a second set of score lines to the ends of the other oppositely disposed body panels, each of the first set of score lines comprising a substantially horizontal score line portion and a slanted score line portion; and the second set of score lines comprising a horizontal score line located higher than the other horizontal score line, the first and second sets of score lines thus providing a flat end closure which is effectively square with the body panels.



2. A container according to claim 1, wherein each of the slanted score line portions begins at a point spaced in one direction apart from opposite ends of the other horizontal score line, and each of the horizontal score line portions begins at a point spaced in the same direction apart from opposite ends of the said one  horizontal score line.



3. A container according to claim   l    or claim 2, wherein a fold line is formed across one of the rectangular panels such that it is folded onto itself while the other of the rectangular panels extends across the carton providing a fully covered outer surface therefor.



4. A container described in claim 3, and a pair of fold-back panels formed on opposite sides of each of the gusset panels integrally connected to the   adj.acent    rectangular panels, and a score line segment formed across one of each of the pairs of fold-back panels aligned with the fold line across one of the rectangular panels such that one of each of the pairs of fold-back panels is folded onto itself while the other of each of the pairs of fold-back panels extend across the carton.



5. A container according to claim 4, and comprising additional score lines formed across each of the other fold-back panels and across the other of the rectangular panels to facilitate the folding of these panels into a slanted attitude and then across the carton within serving to fold these panels onto themselves.



6. In a blank for forming a paperboard carton including  four adjacent side panels and a side seam flap integrally connected to the outermost edge of one of the outer side panels, an end closure comprising a gusset panel connected to the end of each of alternate side panels by means of a horizontal score line segment for one half of its width and a slanted scoreline segment for the other half of its width, and defined by diagonal score lines separating each gusset panel from a pair of fold-back panels, a score line portion formed across one of each pair of fold-back panels, a full, unscored, rectangular panel connected to one of the other side panels by a first horizontal score line at a location below the lower end of the slanted score line segment, 

 and a rectangular panel connected to the fourth side panel by a second horizontal score line at a location below the horizontal score line segment and above the first horizontal score line, and a score line formed across the last-mentioned rectangular panel and substantially aligned with the score line portions.



7. A blank for forming a paperboard carton, constructed and arranged substantially as hereinbefore described with reference to and as illustrated in the accompanying drawings.  



8. A container or carton formed from a blank according to claim 6 or claim 7.
