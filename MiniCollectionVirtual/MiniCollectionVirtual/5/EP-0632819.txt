<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to addition polymerization
catalysts comprising certain stabilized, reduced metal
complexes. Such catalysts additionally employ an activating
cocatalyst. Finally the invention relates to an improved
method for preparing the stabilized reduced metal complexes.
The compositions are especially useful as catalysts for the
polymerization of olefins such as ethylene for the
preparation of polymers having utility as molding resins and
in the formation of foamed products having cushioning and
insulating applications and films that are useful as
protective wrappings.In EP-A-0 416 845 there are disclosed and claimed
certain monocyclopentadienyl metal complexes having utility
as homogeneous olefin polymerization catalysts.
In US-A-5,064,802 (equivalent to EP-A-0 418 044), cationic
monocyclopentadienyl metal complexes with salts of Brondsted
acids containing a non-coordinating compatible anion are
disclosed and claimed. In EP-A-0 468 651, an oxidative
activation technique for preparing such cationic catalysts is
disclosed and claimed.In US-A-4,057,565 there are disclosed Ti, Zr, or Hf
derivatives of 2-dialkylaminobenzyl or 2-dialkylaminomethylphenyl
all in the + 4 oxidation state which are useful
as components of catalysts for olefin polymerization.In J.Am.Chem. Soc. 100,8068-8073 (1978) there is
mentioned the synthesis and characterization of Ti(+3)
complexes containing cyclopentadienyl groups and 2-dialkylaminobenzyl
or 2-dialkylaminomethylphenyl groups. No
mention of utility as addition polymerization catalysts is
given.In US-A-4,870,042, catalysts for olefin
polymerizations comprising a pyrazolyl borate complex of 
titanium or zirconium compounds including titanium
trichloride (Example 4) are disclosed.In Organometallics, 10, 3227-3237 (1991) certain
titanium +3 complexes containing cyclopentadienyl groups and
alkyl groups are mentioned. On page 3236, the reference
states:
   "So far no well-defined neutral titanium-based
molecular system with established activity for
catalytic olefin polymerization has been described...
Apparently, the tervalent Cp*2TiR system cannot induce
sufficient positive charge at the β-carbon atom of an
incoming ethylene molecule to reach the polar
transition state for migratory insertion."In Journal of Organometallic Chemistry, 334 (1987) C1-C4,
η3-allyl(bis-η5-cyclopentadienyl) titanium (III) activated
with dimethylaluminum chloride was found to create a
coordinated species Cp2Ti (allyl) - (CH3)2AℓCℓ which was found to
polymerize ethylene to a small extent. Use
