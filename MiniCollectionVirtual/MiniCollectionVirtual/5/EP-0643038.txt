<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention fits within the technical field 
of surface active agents and specifically refers to novel 
polyfunctional cationic surface active agents that combine 
the softening and wetting effects along with the 
capacity of biodegradation which makes them extremely 
attractive from the point of view of consumption and 
marketing. Over the last few years important advances have 
been made in the formulation of household softeners, 
up to the point that before 1990 the market that could be 
considered static suddenly began to move with very 
important dynamics. On the other hand, the interest of offering concentrated 
products, mainly ones that can be diluted with 
three times their volume in water, that do not gellify 
during storage, which dilute instantly without forming 
lumps and also with a stable viscosity until they are 
all used up is obvious. Simultaneously, the concentrated 
product can also be rapidly and easily added to the 
washing machine at the end of the washing cycle. The greater and greater acceptance of concentrates 
has commercial and ecological advantages. Hence, 
the reduction of the cost of the container and reduction 
of pollution caused by the container above all in 
the case of brick-shaped cardboard containers are worth 
pointing out. Besides, the reduction of space on store 
shelves and the smaller transporting of water and weight 
by housewives is also worth pointing out. On the other hand, a very important factor that 
has influenced research on new chemical structures,  
 
recently introduced in the corresponding formulations, 
is the need to offer molecules with a greater biodegradability. As a general rule, it is accepted that a cationic 
structure, in order to be used as a softener base, 
must proferably be comprised of two fatty chains of 
C₁₀-C₂₂ carbon atoms and two short chains of the methyl, 
hydroxyethyl type, etc., also establishing a ratio 
between the insaturation of the chain and the balance 
between the softening power of the wetting power of 
the product. A complement of this general rule is the fact 
that upon introducing labile functional groups, especially 
of the ester group, the biodegradability of the 
molecule increases very remarkably.In favor of this latest tendency is also the fact 
of the stability of these molecules against hydrolysis 
in normal working conditions. The number of publications that cited molecules 
oriented in the above cited line already begins to be 
considerable and among said works we can cite: U.S. patent no.
