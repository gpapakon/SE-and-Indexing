<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system for diagnosing faults in systems and is relevant
to diagnosing faults in systems which consist of interacting components where it is the
functionality of the components which has been tested.The present invention relates particularly but not exclusively to a system for diagnosing
faults in printed circuit boards which have failed their functional test during manufacture.
The present invention is not relevant to in-circuit testing of circuit boards where the
individual components on the board are tested using probes and diagnosis is not required.
However it is applicable in cases where in-circuit testing needs to be supplemented by the
functional testing of clusters of components which are not individually tested.History-based systems in the form of fault dictionaries and expert systems have been used
to address the problem of fault diagnosis. However, it can take a long time for such a
system to begin to perform well in view of the need to build up a substantial body of case
data and this is not compatible with the current trend towards products with ever shorter
production lifecycles.Many existing diagnostic systems define diagnosis in terms of a sequence of tests which
are performed, usually by a test engineer with guidance from the diagnostic system, in the
search for a diagnosis. Such diagnostic systems may be integrated with the system for
carrying out the functional testing. The diagnostic strategy is often a repeated cycle of test
and diagnostic refinement which requires repeat cycles of system calls from the diagnostic
system to the test system. This process is often time-consuming and not cost-effective.Known board diagnosis systems typically reason about each part of the board separately,
using measurements from points that lie in between modules of the board under test to
determine the location of the problem. This approach requires probes to be placed on
internal parts of the board by a test engineer and makes the assumption that such
measurements are themselves correct.There are some known diagnostic systems which use only information provided to the 
system prior to test to reason about diagnosis. However, such systems require a full
structural description of the system under test as a model to be used in diagnosis and this can
be time-consuming to develop and difficult to maintain if the system being diagnosed
undergoes revision.

<CLAIMS>
A diagnostic system (10) for diagnosing the cause of failures of functional tests made on
a system under test wherein the system under test comprises a plurality of interacting

components and wherein the diagnostic system (10) has means (20) for utilising the following
data:


data describing the components of the system under test,
data defining functional tests, including which operations are performed to conduct a test and
which components are exercised by the test;
data describing previous test results;
said means (20) further comprising means for generating candidate diagnosis of test failures by
cross-correlating test results using the definitions of the failing functional tests thereby

generating candidate sets of faulty components based on the operations involved in carrying
out the tests.
A diagnostic system (10) according to claim 1 further comprising means for cross-correlating
test results based on the degree to which the operations utilise the components

in the system under test.
A diagnostic system (10) according to claim 1 or claim 2 which is operable to recognise
an 'operation violation',

that is, when an operation is involved in both failing and passing tests,
and

to correlate results from such tests to help prioritise the likelihood of the components of the
system under test which are involved in carrying out the said operation having caused test

failure.
A diagnostic system (10) according to claim 3 which is operable to apply a penalty factor
to each candidate diagnosis (D) involving operation violations.
A diagnostic system (10) according to any preceding claim comprising means for
providing a list of candidate diagnosis (D) ranked in order of probability. 
A diagnostic system (10) according to any preceding claim comprising means for
indicating further tests which could usefully be carried out following diagnosis.
A diagnostic system (10) according to any preceding claim which is integrated with a
functional test system so that it further comprises:


means (12) for storing said data describing the components of the system under test;
means (18) for storing said definitions of functional tests;
means for performing tests on the system under test;
means (14) for storing said previous test results;

and wherein the diagnostic system (10) is operable automatically to utilise the test results to
diagnose the causes of test failure.
A diagnostic system according to any preceding claim which is operable to utilise the
results of individual component tests generated prior to the system test.
A diagnostic system (10) according to any preceding claim operable to diagnose faults
in printed circuit boards or multi-chip modules.
