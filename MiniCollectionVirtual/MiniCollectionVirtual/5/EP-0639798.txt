<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a treating 
solution for the surface of lithographic printing plates 

having silver images utilized as ink-receptive portions 
which contains at least one compound having mercapto 

group or thion group and an amine compound. The 

treating solution may further contain hydrophilic 
colloid particles having an average particle size of 0.1 

µm or less and an amino acid to inhibit stain of non-image 
background portions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a treating
solution for lithographic printing plates in which
silver images are utilized as ink-receptive portions,
said treating solution improving ink-receptivity of the
image portions at the beginning of printing and
inhibiting non-image portions from staining.Printing plates made using silver halide
emulsions having a high sensitivity and capable of being
spectrally sensitized have already been put to practical
use. Of these printing plates, offset printing plates
in which silver images are utilized as ink-receptive
portions are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,721,559 and
3,490,905, Japanese Patent Kokoku No. 48-30562, U.S.
Patent Nos. 3,385,701 and 3,814,603, Japanese Patent
Kokoku No. 44-27242, Japanese Patent Kokai No. 53-21602,
U.S. Patent Nos. 3,454,398, 3,764,323 and 3,099,209, and
Japanese Patent Kokai No. 53-9603.Methods for making these printing plates are
roughly classified into some types, but they are common
in that the silver images are rendered ink receptive. A
lithographic printing plate comprises an oleophilic
image portion which is receptive to inks and a hydrophilic
non-image portion which receives water. In usual
lithographic printing, both water and ink are fed to the 
surface of the printing plate to allow the image portion
to receive preferentially the colored ink and the non-image
portion to receive preferentially water and then
the ink on the image is transferred onto a substrate
such as paper.Accordingly, in order to obtain prints of good
quality, it is required that the difference of oleophilicity
or hydrophilicity between the surface of the
image and that of the non-image be sufficiently large.The above-mentioned methods for making
printing plates using silver halide emulsions have
favorable features that they are simple, sure and rapid
methods and can be automated and furthermore, can
provide printing plates of high sensitivity, high
resolution and high image reproducibility. However, the
difference of oleophilicity or hydrophilicity between
the surface of the image and that of the non-image of
the resulting printing plates is not sufficiently large
as compared with printing plates (PS plate) made using
organic colloid such as diazo light-sensitive materials.As an approach for solving these problems,
British Patent No.1,373,415 and Japanese Patent Kokai
No.58-127928 disclose to improve ink receptivity by
acting a compound having mercapto group or thion group
on silver image. That is, it is considered that the
mercapto group of the compound
