<ABSTRACT>
A novel serum calcium depressing factor derived from 
swine pancreas, which has a molecular weight of 26,500 to 

28,000 D as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, 
an isoelectric point of about 4.5 as determined by isoelectric 

electrophoresis, and an amino acid sequence of Val-Val-Gly-Gly-Gln-Asn-Ala-Ile-Pro-His-Ser-Trp-Pro-Trp-Gln-Ile-Arg-Leu- at or near the N-terminus. It has a protease activity and is 
inhibited by PMSF, chymostatin and trypsin inhibitor but not 

by APMSF and E-64. The novel depressing factor is expected 
to be applicable as a medicine for treating and preventing bone 

diseases such as osteoporosis.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a serum calcium 
decreasing factor of pig origin, a process for the 
production thereof and a pharmaceutical composition 
containing said factor. Although the presence of a serum calcium decreasing 
factor is suggested by Takaoka et al. [Nippon Iji Sinpo 
2951, 15-20 (1980)], it has not yet been purified, and 
its properties have not been clarified. Accordingly, the present invention is intended to 
provide a novel isolated serum calcium decreasing factor 
of pig origin. The present inventors succeeded in isolating and 
purifying the aimed serum calcium decreasing factor from 
porcine pancreas, clarified the characteristics of the 
substance, and clarified some of the biological 
properties thereof, and thus accomplished the present 
invention. Namely, the present invention provides a 
novel serum calcium decreasing factor of pig origin 
having the following properties: 
(1) decreasing the serum calcium level in a dose-dependent 
manner in mice; (2) having a molecular weight of about 26,500 to 
28,000D, as estimated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel 
electrophoresis; (3) having an isoelectric point of about 4.5 as 
estimated by isoelectric focusing; (4) having the following amino acid sequence (SQ IN 
No. 1) at the N-terminus or near to the N-terminus: Val-Val-Gly-Gly-Gln-Asn-Ala-Ile-Pro-His-Ser-Trp-Pro-Trp-Gln-Ile-Arg-Leu-;  (5) having protease activity, and being inhibited  
 
by protease inhibitor phenyl methane sulfonyl fluoride 
(PMSF) (1 mM), chymostatin (100 µM) and trypsin inhibitor 
(100 µg/ml), but not being inhibited by (4-amidinophenyl) 
methane sulfonyl chloride (APMSF) (50 µM) and N-[N-(L-3-trans-carboxyoxirane-2-carbonyl)-L-leucyl] 
agmatine (E-64) 
(2.5 µg/ml).   The present invention further provides a process for 
production of said serum calcium decreasing factor, 
characterized by isolating the serum calcium decreasing 
factor from the pancreas of a pig. The present invention further provides a 
pharmaceutical composition comprising the serum calcium 
decreasing factor. Fig. 1 shows A profile of elution in Q-Sepharose 
fast flow chromatography. Only the peak III exhibits 
serum calcium decreasing activity. In Fig. 2, A shows a profile of elution in a gel 
filtration chromatography by Superdex 75HR. A shows 
inhibition of calcium release (by PTH) in a Raisz's organ 
culture method, by some fractions corresponding to B. 
Only the main peak exhibits calcium release-inhibitory 
activity. Fig. 3 shows a profile of elution in an ion exchange 
chromatography by Mono
