<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a gear-casing, especially for an angular, e.g. worm, gear, with a cylindrical passage (1) running along an extruded section forming the casing (2) which has external grooves (3) opening into plane external surfaces (4, 5, 6, 7) of the casing (2) which are inclined towards each other at an angle of preferably 90 DEG . There is a drilling (8) in the casing (2) starting from one of the plane external surfaces, the peripheral surface of which intersects with the outside of the passage running along the extruded section. Here, the grooves (3) have undercuts and are especially T-, trapezoidally or dovetail-shaped, the aperture (9) of the groove (3) in the external surfaces (4, 5, 6, 7) having the smallest cross-sectional width.

Gear casing (2), particularly for a mitre gear, 
e.g. a worm gear, having a through-opening (1), 

particularly a circular cylindrical through-opening, 
which extends longitudinally of the gear casing (2) 

provided with smooth outer surfaces (4, 5, 6, 7) which 
is formed by an extruded section, the smooth outer 

surfaces being provided with grooves (3) produced by the 
extrusion process which open into the smooth outer 

surfaces, the smooth outer surfaces being inclined to 
one another at an angle, preferably 90°, whilst, starting 

from one outer surface (7) of the smooth outer surfaces, 
a bore (8) is formed in the gear casing (2), the 

circumferential surface of which bore (8) cuts into the 
lining of the through-bore (1), characterised in that 

the grooves have undercuts which are, in particular, T-shaped, 
trapezoidal or dovetailed in shape, the openings 

(9) of the grooves (3) located in the outer surfaces (4, 
5, 6, 7) being the narrowest part of the groove cross 

section. 
Mitre gear, particularly a worm gear having a worm, 
with a gear casing (2) according to claim 1, wherein a 

greater wheel of the mitre gear is mounted in the 
through-opening (1) and a pinion (11) meshing with the 

greater wheel is mounted in the bore (8) starting from 
the smooth outer surface (7), characterised in that a 

bearing housing (14) is provided with a bearing (13), 
especially a roller bearing, in which is mounted a shaft 

(12 or 17) carrying the pinion (11), the bearing housing 
(14) being flanged on to the gear casing (2) by means of 

a flange (15) which abuts on the outer surface (7) from 
which the bore (8) proceeds, and
 
   either the shaft is a pinion shaft (12) which 

passes through the bearing housing (14), the gear casing  
 

(2) containing, adjacent to the bore (8) in the form of 
a blind bore, another bearing point (18) which is 

constructed in particular as a needle bearing, for the 
pinion shaft (12),
 
   or the shaft is a rotor shaft (17) of a flange 

motor (16), the bearing housing (14) being a housing 
portion of the flange motor (16), the rotor shaft (17) 

of which carries the pinion (11) at its free end. 
Mitre gear, particularly a worm gear, according to 
claim 2, wherein a bearing is provided on each side of 

the greater wheel in order to mount a shaft carrying the 
greater wheel, said bearing taking the form, in 

particular, of a roller bearing, e.g. a ball bearing, 
characterised in that each bearing (19) is arranged in a 

bushing (20) inserted in the through-opening (1) of the 
extruded section or this bushing (20) forms a sleeve 

bearing. 
Mitre gear, particularly a worm gear, according to 
claim 3, characterised in that each of the bushings (20) 

is held in the through-opening (1) by means of the 
roller bearing (19) arranged therein, the outer ring 

(21) of the roller bearing (19) abutting on a shoulder 
(22) of the bushing (20) and an inner ring (23) of the 

roller bearing (19) abutting on a spring ring (25) 
inserted in an annular groove of the greater wheel shaft 

(24). 
Mitre gear, particularly a worm gear, according to 
claim 3, characterised in that the bushings (20) are 

braced against each other by several, preferably three, 
clamping bolts (26), each of which passes through two 

axial bores (27) arranged in alignment with one another 
in the bushings (20). 
Mitre gear, particularly a worm gear, according to  
 

claim 5, characterised in that the bores (27) receiving 
the clamping bolts (26) are outwardly sealed off by 

washers (28) of elastically deformable material, 
particularly plastics, which are arranged between the 

screw head (29) or nut (30) and the adjacent outer 
surface (31) of the bushing (20). 
Mitre gear, particularly a worm gear, according to 
claim 2, characterised in that the through-opening (1) 

of the gear casing is machined starting from the two end 
faces of the extruded section, whilst between the 

machined portions there is an unmachined central part, 
and at the point of transition between the machined and 

unmachined portions there is a shoulder (34) which acts 
as an abutment surface for a bearing (32) arranged on 

both sides of the greater wheel (10).
