<ABSTRACT>
In a wireless private branch exchange (11), communication network (10), a method and apparatus are offered for identifying network communication resources. The method includes the steps of measuring a signal quality factor of a channel of a selected spectrum and comparing the measured values with a threshold value. The method further includes the step of selecting channels, exceeding the threshold, as network communication resources. The selected spectrum is that also used by a local cellular communication network. Where scanning determines that a channel is not used by the cellular system then use is permitted with the private system.

<DESCRIPTION>
 IBELESS PBX SYSTEM USING FREQUENCY SCANNER FOR CHANNEL IDENTIFICATIONField of the InventionThe invention relates to communication systems and, in specific, to wireless communication systems used in conjunction with private branch exchange communication systems. Background of the InventionPrivate branch exchange communication systems (PBXs) are known. PBXs are commonly used where a discrete group of people (e.g., employees of a company) need to communicate, in large measure, within the group. A PBX, in providing service within the group, is typically limited to a fixed geographic area coincident with a company facility or group of facilities.PBXs offer advantages in that calls between members of the discrete group are handled locally within the PBX and do not involve an associated public switch telephone network (PSTN). Such local handling reduces the cost of providing communication services within the group. PBXs also provide other advantages, such as call blocking to specific numbers or groups of numbers. Call blocking, in such case, may be used by a PBX operator to prevent long-distance calls from specific telephones or groups of telephones within the private system.Cellular communication systems are also known. Cellular communication systems, as opposed to PBX systems, are constructed to provide communication services over broad geographic areas through a number of base sites. Each base site within such a system is positioned to provide service within a service coverage area, partially overlapping adjacent service coverage areas, in such a manner as to provide substantially continuous coverage to a communication unit passing through such an area.Communication service, within a cellular system, is provided to a communication unit on a radio channel selected from a number of communication channels (fl-fn) available 

within the system. Such radio channel are assigned to communication units upon request.Cellular communication systems are typically interconnected with the PSTN either locally, through an interconnect at each base station, or centrally, through a mobile switching center (MSC) that interfaces with a number of base sites. The interconnect with the PSTN allows a communication unit to communicate with subscribers throughout the PSTN as well as other communication units. The interconnect with the PSTN also allows a communication unit to communicate, through PBXs with telephone users within a PBX.While both PBXs and cellular communication systems work well in their respective market niches,

Claims
1. In a wireless private branch exchange communication network located within a service coverage area of a ceUular communication system and reusing ceUular communication resources, a method of identifying network communication resources, such method comprising the steps of: measuring a signal quaHty factor of a ceUular system communication resource; comparing the measured value with a threshold value; and when the measured value exceeds the threshold, selecting the communication resource as a network communication resource. 2. The method as in claim 1 further including repeating the measurement, comparison, and selection for each communication resource within a selected spectrum.
3. The method as in claim 2 further including transferring an identifier of selected communication resource to a network controUer of the wireless communication network.
4. The method as in claim 1 further including transferring, by a network controUer of the wireless communication network, an identifier of a communication resource to a scan receiver.
5 The method as in claim 4 further including measuring, upon receipt of the identifier, the signal quaHty factor of the communication resource by the scan receiver.
6. The method as in claim 5 further including transferring the measured signal quaHty factor of the communication resource back to the network controUer. 7. In a wireless private branch exchange communication network located within a service coverage area of a ceUular communication system and reusing ceUular communication resources, an apparatus for identifying network communication resources, such apparatus comprising: means for measuring a signal quaHty factor of a ceUular system communication resource; means for comparing the measured values with a threshold value; and means for selecting the communication resource as a network communication resources when the measured signal quaHty factor exceeds the threshold. 


8. The apparatus as in claim 7 further comprising means for repeating the measurement, comparison, and selection for each communication resource within a selected spectrum.
9. The apparatus as in claim 7 further comprising means for transferring an identifier of selected communication resources to a network controUer of the wireless communication network. 10. The apparatus as in claim 7 further comprising means for transferring, by a network controller of the wireless communication network, an identifier of a communication resource to a scan receiver.
