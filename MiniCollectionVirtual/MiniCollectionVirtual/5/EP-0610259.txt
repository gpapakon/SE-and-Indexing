<ABSTRACT>
E.g. for video applications fast multipliers with high resolution are required. But a higher resolution results in more partial products to be calculated internally. The Booth-Mc Sorley algorithm can be used in order to reduce the required number of such partial products. This algorithm can be combined with a diagonal propagation of the carry from one partial product to the other, allowing all the sums on a line to be calculated simultaneously. But the reachable multiplication time is not short enough. The inventive multiplier in nearly full CMOS design has been constructed with a 1.2  mu  BICMOS technology, having a multiplication time of 9 ns with a supply voltage of 5 volts. Minimum multiplication time has been achieved by a combination of the following techniques: use of the Booth-Mc Sorley algorithm in order to reduce the number of partial products; diagonal propagation of the carry from one partial product to the other allowing all the sums on one line to be done simultaneously; use of the carry select approach in the final 14 bits adder and in the first two adders in the intermediate rows; use of inventive fast one-bit full adders with complementary pass transistor logic.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a 1-bit adder. This adder 
can be used in a multiplier. E.g. for video applications fast digital multipliers with 
high resolution are required. But a higher resolution results 
in more partial products to be calculated internally. 
The Booth-McSorley algorithm can be used in order to reduce 
the required number of such partial products. This algorithm 
is disclosed in O.L. MAC SORLEY, 'High-Speed Arithmetic in 
Binary Computers', Proceedings of the IRE, January 1961, 
Vol. 49, Pages 67-91. This algorithm can be combined with a 
diagonal propagation of the carry from one partial product 
to the other, allowing all the sums on a line to be calculated 
simultaneously. But the reachable multiplication time 
is not short enough. Extensive electrical simulations have shown that with 1.2Âµ 
CMOS technology (HF3CMOS) a multiplication time of 9ns cannot 
be achieved in one step. Such a short multiplication 
time would normally need submicron MOS technology or the use 
of ECL techniques. 
One can construct a digital multiplier with improved speed 
which utilizes an improved speed adder. It is an object of the invention to disclose a 1-bit adder 
with improved speed. This object is reached by the inventive 
adder disclosed in claim 1.  
 Advantageous additional embodiments of the inventive adder 
are resulting from the respective dependent claim. Several levels of pipeline are required within such multiplier. 
Taking into account the delay of the input and output 
latches, the multiplier has an overall latency of 5 (i.e. 
45ns for a 108MHz clock). For reducing the multiplication 
time within subblocks of the multiplier a carry select technique 
is used to have minimum propagation delay. For this 
reason, too, the inventive 1-bit full adder has been designed 
which uses complementary pass transistor logic. This 
adder has the advantage of giving full power supply swings 
at the outputs whilst still maintaining the speed properties 
of the pass transistor logic. In principle the inventive adder comprises a carry stage and 
an adding stage and is constructed in a fast CMOS complementary 
pass transistor logic with complementary analogue CMOS 
switches in said adding stage which consist of a PMOS and a 
NMOS transistor, whereby the source of said PMOS transistor 
is connected with the drain of said NMOS transistor and the 
drain of said PMOS transistor is connected with the source 
of said NMOS transistor and the gate of said PMOS transistor 
receives inverted signals with respect to
