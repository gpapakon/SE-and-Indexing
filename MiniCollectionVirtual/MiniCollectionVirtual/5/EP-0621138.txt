<ABSTRACT>
A printing sheet which is adapted for use in thermal transfer recording 
comprises a substrate and a dye image-receiving layer formed on the substrate. 

The layer is made of a resin composition comprising a thermoplastic resin, an 
alcohol-modified silicone and an isocyanate compound. The thermoplastic resin 

is preferably a cellulose ester or a polyester and the isocyanate compound is 
preferably a mixture of aromatic and aliphatic isocyanates at an equivalent ratio 

of 0.1:1 to 5:1. The printing sheet has an improved sebum resistance without 
lowering writing properties while ensuring good fundamental characteristics 

such as sensitivity and image stability.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a printing sheet which is adapted for forming dye 
images thereon by heating an ink ribbon according to image information by use 
of a thermal head or a laser beam to melt or diffuse the dye in an imagewise 
pattern and receiving the dye image on the printing sheet. As is known in the art, there have been widely used thermal transfer 
recording methods wherein an ink ribbon is heated according to image 
information by use of a thermal head or a laser beam to thermally melt or diffuse 
the ink from the ink ribbon and the thus melted or diffused dye is transferred on 
a printing sheet. In recent years, attention has been paid to so-called 
sublimation-type thermal transfer recording methods wherein full color images 
with a continuous tone or gradation are formed using thermally diffusable dyes 
such as sublimable dyes. For instance, attempts have been made to form images 
on a video printing sheet by spottedly heating an ink ribbon according to signals 
of video images. More particularly, as shown in Fig. 1, there is used a video printing sheet 1 
which includes a sheet substrate 2 such as of polypropylene and a dye image-receiving 
layer 3 formed on the substrate 2. The dye image-receiving layer 3 is 
able to receive a dye transferred from an ink ribbon by heating and keeps the 
resultant image thereon. The image-receiving layer 3 has been conventionally 
made of resins which are susceptible to dyeing with dyes. Such resins include  
 
thermoplastic resins such as polyesters, polycarbonates, polyvinyl chloride, 
vinyl chloride copolymers such as vinyl chloride-vinyl acetate copolymers, 
polyurethanes, polystyrene, AS resins, ABS resins and the like. Recently, in order to enhance sensitivity enough to form clear images and to 
improve the weatherability, light fastness and thermal stability of images so 
that once formed images can be stably kept, various attempts have been made on 
resins for the dye image-receiving layer. For instance, in order to improve the 
light fastness and weatherability of images, there has been proposed a dye 
image-receiving layer which is made mainly of cellulose esters. However, as the thermal transfer recording methods have been widespread, 
there is an increasing demand for solving the following problem in practical 
applications, not to mention the improvements in the weatherability, light 
fastness and thermal stability. More particularly, the image formed on known 
printing sheets is not resistant to sebum. When the image surface is rubbed 
with
