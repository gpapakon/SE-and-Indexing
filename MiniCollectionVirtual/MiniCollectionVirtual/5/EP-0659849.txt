<ABSTRACT>
Clear (transparent), expandable, flame-resistant coating compositions consist at least of     from 10 to 70 % by weight of a film-forming binder, from 0 to 40 % by weight of at least one substance which is carbonised under the effect of heat,   from 0 to 40 % by weight of an expansion (blowing) agent,   from 0 to 5 % by weight of dispersants and   from 0 to 25 % by weight of fillers.   In these compositions, aqueous synthetic-resin dispersions are present as binder, and ammonium salts of alkyl phosphates are present as substances which are carbonised under the effect of heat and/or as expansion agents, and as acid donors, in a quantity of from 1 to 50 % by weight.
