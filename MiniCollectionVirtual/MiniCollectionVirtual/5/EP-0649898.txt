<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to thickened aqueous abrasive 
cleansers containing hypochlorite bleach with improved phase stability. Thickened hypochlorite bleach solutions or compositions have 
long been used in a variety of applications including hard surface cleaning, 
disinfecting and the like. These compositions are typically provided with 
increased viscosity for a number of reasons, principally to increase residence 
time of the composition on non-horizontal surfaces. Many different examples of thickened hypochlorite bleach 
compositions have been available from a wide variety of sources for use in 
hard surface cleaning. For example, Finley et al., European Patent 
Application EP 373.864 and Prince et al., U.S. Patent 5,130,043, disclosed 
hypochlorite bleach compositions consisting of polyacrylate thickeners, amine 
oxide detergent, and optional fatty acid soap and/or a bleach stable synthetic 
anionic detergent for cleaning hard surfaces such as toilet bowls, bathroom 
tiles and shower walls. However, both of these references do not disclose, 
teach, or suggest the need to reduce or limit the free electrolyte, or ionic 
strength, of thickened cleaners. Other prior art references have also described various thickened 
automatic dish washing liquid compositions using polyacrylates in combination 
with colloidal thickeners to provide proper rheology and stability in 
hypochlorite bleach compositions including various adjuncts. Stoddart, U.S. 
Patent 4,576,728, and Corring, U.S. Patent 4,836,948, are representative of  
 
these other prior art references. These types of cleaners contain large 
amounts of builders, or other materials, which would boost the ionic strength 
of the resulting composition. Also, as automatic dish washing compositions 
(or, "ADWD's"), such cleaners typically must include silicates as overgiaze 
protectors and contain relatively low amounts of surfactants, if at all, to 
prevent high foaming action. Additionally, there are examples of hypochlorite-containing 
abrasive cleansers in the art, but they typically require either a colloidal clay 
thickener, such as disclosed in Hartman, U.S. Patents 3,985,668, 4,005,027 and 
4,051,056, a mixture of surfactants, such as disclosed in Jones et al., U.S. 
Patent 4,352,678, or a stearate soap, such as disclosed in Chapman, U.S. Patent 
4,240,919. All of these systems suffer from disadvantages, such as premature 
hardening in the colloidal clay-thickened systems, or poor phase stability, as in 
the stearate-thickened systems. Other
