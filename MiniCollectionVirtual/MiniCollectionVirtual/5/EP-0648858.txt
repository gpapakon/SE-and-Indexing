<ABSTRACT>
The disclosure relates to a method of protecting a 
semiconductor workpiece (129) from contact with 

free-floating particulate contamination during plasma 
etching of the workpiece. Gaseous materials which are 

capable of forming a polymeric coating upon exposure to 
a plasma are used to generate films of polymeric coating 

(122) which trap particulate contaminants against the 
etch chamber walls (113), making these contaminants 

unavailable to contaminate the workpiece surface. 
Preferred materials include certain halocarbon gases.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of controlling particulate contamination of a 
semiconductor workpiece surface/substrate during processing which employs plasma etching. As the geometries of semiconductor devices become ever so smaller, the ability to 
maintain the uniformity and accuracy of critical dimensions becomes strained. Many of the 
processes carried out within semiconductor processing reactors leave contaminant deposits 
on the walls of the process chamber which accumulate and become the source of particulate 
matter harmful to the creation of a semiconductor device. As the dimensional size of the 
semiconductor device has become ever smaller, the presence of particulate matter upon the 
surface of the semiconductor workpiece has become ever more critical. Particulate contamination buildup on semiconductor process chamber walls has long 
been a major problem in the etch processing of semiconductor elements employing metal 
films. These metal films are generally etched by employing a number of reactive gases, 
including halocarbon gases, as plasma components. In the case of an aluminum film, the 
etchant gases used are predominantly the chlorine containing gases, chlorine (Cl₂) and boron 
trichloride (BCl₃), which enables formation of volatile aluminum chloride compounds upon 
etching, which volatile compounds can be removed from the etch processing chamber by 
applied vacuum. However, simultaneously with the formation of volatile aluminum chloride 
compounds, other active chlorine and boron containing species are formed which can react 
with any oxygen and water vapor present in the etch processing chamber or with organic  
 
species from patterning photoresist to form non volatile particulate compositions which 
ultimately produce relatively large quantities of contaminant on the process chamber inner 
walls. The non volatile particulate compositions initially tend to remain inside the etch 
chamber in the form of loosely attached particles to the chamber etch surfaces. The loosely 
attached compounds can easily break free of the surface to which they are attached, and fall 
upon a workpiece/ substrate surface, causing contamination of the workpiece surface and 
resulting in a defective device. Further, as time progresses, the non volatile compositions 
combine with polymeric materials generated from photoresist and carbon-containing etchant 
gases (by products of the etch process) and accumulate to form a contaminant deposit on the 
etch process chamber surfaces. As the thickness of this

A method for coating a plasma etch chamber to secure plasma generated particulate by-products 
to the chamber wall comprising: 


a) providing a plasma etch chamber having a workpiece pedestal and plasma generated 
particulate residues attached to the inner walls thereof; 
b) communicating into the chamber at least one carbon containing material which
