<ABSTRACT>
Clock marks for extracting clock components are made in advance at regular intervals along the track of 
a discoid recording medium, and clock components are extracted by detecting these clock marks at the time of 

rotating the discoid recording medium. Since the clock components are extracted from the definitely and periodically 
arranged clock marks in such a way, and interpolating clocks in sections between clock marks are generated based 

on the extracted clock components, highly accurate clocks can be obtained as compared with the case where clocks 
are extracted from reproduced codes. Therefore, the capacity of the discoid recording medium can be remarkably 

increased.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a disk apparatus,
and is applicable to, for example, a hard-disk
apparatus.In the hard disk, each of a plurality of data
recording areas (hereinafter referred to as tracks)
concentrically arranged with respect to the center of
the disk is divided into a plurality of blocks
(hereinafter referred to as sectors), and data is
divided and recorded on these sectors. In hard-disk
apparatuses, there has been adopted a sector servo
method as a servo method which is used in reading data
from sectors.This servo method asynchronously detects a servo
header from each sector, locks phase-locked loop (PLL)
output by means of a synchronous (SYNC) pattern and the
like, and generates various types of timing signals 
based on the PLL output.A gap region (redundancy signal region, etc.) of a
specified length was therefore needed in front of a
servo zone, as shown in Fig. 1.However, this servo method, as shown in Fig. 2,
has the problem that, while the position and the time
near the head of the sector can be controlled
comparatively accurately, control near the end (points
P1 and P2 of the figure) of the sector easily becomes
inaccurate.That is, since the sector servo method generates a
synchronizing signal at a unit of several tens of
sectors per one lap of the track, it cannot follow a
change in the time axis such as a change in the
rotation of the disk and cannot obtain the positions of
as many as several ten thousands of bit units per one
lap with a high degree of accuracy.The number of regions to which servo information
is given can be increased to solve this, but it is hard
to improve the track density from the viewpoint of
accuracy of writing because the sector servo method
writes the servo information in units of sectors.
Likewise, the position on the disk could not be fixed
with a high degree of accuracy for this reason. Considering the above points, the present
invention provides a disk apparatus in which an angular
position on the track can be specified with a high
degree of accuracy without increasing the area occupied
by servo information.To solve such problems,
a disk apparatus according to
the present invention
comprises
the following features which are known from JP 05 067375 and US 5
253243 and which are included in the preamble of claim 1:
rotational drive means for rotating and
driving a disk recording medium (2) having a plurality
of clock marks (CM) formed in advance at constant
intervals along recording tracks; recording and/or
reproducing means (3) for recording and/or
