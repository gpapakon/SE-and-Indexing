<ABSTRACT>
A rotary position transducer (1) has a housing (4) which has a cutout (5). A pivotable hood (8) can be used to seal the cutout (5) so that a radio-frequency-tight screen is produced for a service cable (17) located therein. Furthermore, a mechanical stress-relief device is formed for the service cable (17) with the hood (8) closed.

<CLAIMS>
An angle measuring device with a housing (4) which has a segmental recess (5), characterized
in that


one part of a multi-part plug connector is fixedly arranged in the recess (5) of the housing (4),
the recess (5) forms a space for reception ofa complementary part (18) which can be plugged
together with the part (6) the plug connector (6, 18),
a connecting cable (17) leading out of the receiving space is connected to the complementary
part (18) of the plug connector (6, 18),
a pivoted hood (8) is provided, with which the recess (5) with the part (6) and the
complementary part (18) of the plug connector (6, 18) plugged into it can be completely

covered, and
the hood (8) can be locked at least in this covering position.
An angle measuring device according to claim 1, characterized in that the housing (4) is of
cylindrical shape and in that the hood (8) can pivot concentrically about the central axis (9) of the

housing (4), whereby the hood makes the recess (5) accessible in first pivoted position and the
recess (5) is covered in a second pivoted position.
An angle measuring device according to claim 1, characterized in that the hood (8) acts as a
mechanical strain relief for the connecting cable (17) in the covering position.
An angle measuring device according to claim 1, characterized in that the hood (8) acts as a
high-frequency screen in the covering position.
An angle measuring device according to claim 1, characterized in that the recess (5) is arranged
in one of the two e
nds of the housing (4) or in the peripheral surface.
An angle measuring device according to any of the preceding claims, characterized in that the
part (6) of the plug connector (6, 18) fixedly arranged in the recess (5) of the housing (4) is

arranged on a circuit board (7) which carries electrical components of the rotary transducer (1).
