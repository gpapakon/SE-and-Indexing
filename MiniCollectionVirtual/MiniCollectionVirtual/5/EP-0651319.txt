<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a system for transferring data between 
computers having asynchronous clocks. A FIFO having multiple levels 

holds the data while en route from a sender to a receiver. The system 
includes a status register (FF0-FF15) for monitoring the FIFO. When 

all levels of the FIFO become full, the status register (FF0-FF15) 
issues a FIFO_FULL signal. When all levels become empty, the status 

register (FF0-FF15) issues a FIFO_EMPTY signal. In these signals, 
there are four events whose timing is important. (1) The 

ACTUATION of the FIFO_FULL occurs immediately after a WRITE 
signal is sent by the sender to the status register (FF)-FF15); (2) the 

ACTUATION of the FIFO_EMPTY signal occurs immediately after a 
READ signal is sent by the receiver to the status register (FF0-FF15); 

(3) the DE-ACTUATION of the FIFO_FULL signal is synchronous 
with the clock of the computer writing to the FIFO; (4) the DE-ACTUATION 

of the FIFO_EMPTY signal is synchronous with the 
clock of the computer reading from the FIFO. The system allows 

throughput through the FIFO to proceed at a very high speed, even 
though the sender and receiver are asynchronous.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a system for transferring data from a
sender to a receiver. The invention has application, for example, to a
system for transferring data between two computers.There are numerous different ways for a computer, named B, to
transfer data to a computer, A. For example, if the two computers
operate at different clock frequencies, they may use a FIFO (First In,
First Out) buffer for the transfer. The FIFO is a holding station for
the data while en route from computer B to computer A.The FIFO may be viewed as a pipeline. Computer B, the
sender, loads a sequence of data words, such as W1, followed by W2,
then W3, and so on, into the pipeline. The pipeline holds the data
words, and makes them available to computer A in serial fashion.
Computer A, the receiver, reads data from the pipeline in the same
order as they were loaded: W1 first, W2 next, and so on.The fact that the order of reading the FIFO, by computer A, is
the same as the order of loading, by computer B, gives rise to the name
"First In, First Out."Two problems arise in such an approach. First, the FIFO has a
limited capacity. The sender must not attempt to load data words into
a fully loaded FIFO. Second, the receiver must not attempt to read
data words from an empty FIFO.There are several approaches to solving these problems. One is
to divide the data into blocks which are exactly the size of the FIFO.
For example, if the FIFO holds eight words, the sender fully loads the
FIFO with a burst of eight data words. Then, the sender waits an
appropriate length of time, while the receiver reads the eight words.
Then the sender loads another eight words. Plainly, this approach imposes a delay on the transfer.Another approach will be explained with reference to Figure 1. Assume that a
COUNTER produces an output which indicates the number of words presently contained
in the FIFO. (Figure 1 indicates a 74-193 COUNTER, which is commercially available.)Before any data words are loaded into the FIFO, the counter output is set to 0000,
as indicated by the sketch in the upper left quadrant of Figure 1. Assume that the
SENDER, B, places four words, W1 through W4, into the FIFO, as indicated in the upper
right quadrant of Figure 1.As each word is loaded, the SENDER issues a pulse to the COUNT UP input of
the COUNTER. Each pulse increments the COUNTER's output. The final output is 0100
(which equals 4 in decimal notation). The COUNTER's output of 0100 indicates that it
contains four words.Then the RECEIVER reads the words. As the RECEIVER
