<ABSTRACT>
In order to create a closed-circuit grinding plant (circulation grinding plant), characterised by a low specific energy requirement, with the use of a material-bed high-pressure comminuting roller-press system which is capable of being very variable with regard to the product quality, for example in order to be able to produce simultaneously at least two different fine finished products of the same material, such as cement, without high material-circulation rates and the use of tube mills or other fine comminuting mills being necessary, it is proposed according to the invention to connect in series at least two grinding circuits, each containing a high-pressure roller press and a sifter, in such a way that the fine-material/medium-material discharge line (19) leads from the sifter (11) of the first grinding circuit if need be together with the sifting air to the sifter (13) of the second grinding circuit, from which its grit (23) [medium material] leads to the second high-pressure roller press (12) and its fine material is discharged as fine finished product (A), in which arrangement a less fine finished product (B) can be delivered from the first grinding circuit, and both finished products (A and B) can be mixed to form an end product of desired product quality.

A closed circuit milling installation with a high pressure roller press
(10) with material bed pulverising of the charge and with a

following dis-agglomerator/classifier (17, 11), whose granular
output feed (20) opens into the roller press (10),
characterised in that
 at least one further- milling circuit is
connected after the first milling circuit, similarly with a high

pressure roller press (12) and dis-agglomerator/classifier (26, 13),
in a manner such that the fine material /medium material extraction

channel (19 or 35) from the classifier (11) of the first milling
circulation opens into the classifier (13) of the second milling

circuit, whereby the granular extraction channel (23) of the second
classifier (13) opens into the second high pressure roller press (12)

and the fine material extraction channel (22, A) of the second
milling circuit is taken out of the recirculating milling installation.
A closed circuit milling installation according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 from the connecting channel (19 or 35) of the
two milling circuits for the transfer of the fine material/medium

material drawn off from the classifier (11) of the first milling circuit,
a partial stream can be let out as a second, less fine completed

product (B).
A closed circuit milling installation according to Claim 1 or Claim 2,
characterised in that
 a (additional) connecting channel (42) joining
the two milling circuits, through which is taken a partial stream of

the classified granules (20) from the first classifier (11) to the first
high pressure roller press (10), is taken to the second high pressure

roller press (12).
