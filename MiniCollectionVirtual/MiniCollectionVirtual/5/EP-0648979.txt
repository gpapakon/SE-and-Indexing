<ABSTRACT>
In a gas turbine combustion chamber which is cooled by means of impact cooling and convention cooling or pure convection cooling, a compensating flow of the cooling air is guided between neighbouring cooling ducts (2) in such a way that the flow velocity in the cooling duct (2) always exceeds a critical limiting value even downtream of a local damage point (6), with the result that a critical limiting temperature is undershot. The compensating flow is led past the outer wall of the combustion chamber. Connecting openings (5) are arranged in a mutually offset fashion between the neighbouring cooling ducts (2) on the opposite sides of a cooling duct (2).

Method for cooling a gas turbine combustion
chamber in which the entire cooling air is guided in

cooling ducts (2), which are separated from one another
by means of cooling ribs (4), between the combustion

chamber wall (1) and the outer wall (3), the gas turbine
combustion chamber being cooled by means of impingement

and convection cooling or pure convection cooling, and
after a local damage location (6) has arisen in the

cooling duct (2), a compensating flow of the cooling
air is guided out of adjacent cooling ducts (2) into

the damaged cooling duct (2), characterized in that the
compensating flow in the cooling duct (2) is guided past

the combustion chamber outer wall (3).
Appliance for carrying out the method according
to Claim 1, consisting of a gas turbine combustion

chamber cooled by means of impingement and convection
cooling or pure convection cooling, in which cooling

ducts (2) separated from one another by cooling ribs
(4) are arranged between the combustion chamber wall

(1) and outer wall (3), characterized in that
connecting openings (5) are arranged between adjacent

cooling ducts (2), the connecting openings (5) being
respectively offset on the opposite sides of a cooling

duct (2) in the cooling ribs (4) on the outer wall side.
Appliance according to Claim 2, characterized in
that the web lengths (L
B
) and the opening lengths (L
O
) of
the connecting openings (5) are of equal size.
Appliance according to Claim 2 or 3,
characterized in that the connecting openings (5)

between the cooling ducts (2) are dimensioned in such a
way that the product of the average opening width (5)

and the cooling duct length (L), referred to the
cross-sectional area (A) of the cooling duct (2), is

located in the range greater than 2 and smaller than 8.
