<ABSTRACT>
In a device for monitoring the air pressure of a tyre in motor vehicles with a sensor which outputs a signal which corresponds to the deformation of the tyre, and with an evaluation unit which detects the signal of the sensor, the sensor is constructed in such a way that it outputs an electrical pulse (I) which corresponds to the degree of deformation of a tyre, in particular the deformation when passing through a contact area. Preferably, the evaluation unit determines the degree of deformation as a function of the amplitude (VA) of the pulse. In a further embodiment, the evaluation unit determines the degree of deformation as a function of the ratio of the duration (ti) of the pulse with respect to the duration (tu) of one revolution of the wheel.

A device for the monitoring of the air pressure in a tyre for motor
vehicles with a sensor, which delivers a signal corresponding to the

deformation of the tyre, and with an evaluation unit, which captures the
signal from the sensor, whereby the sensor is constructed in such a

manner that it delivers an electrical pulse corresponding to a measure
of the deformation of the tyre for one pass of its region of contact with

the tyre,
characterised in that
 the evaluation unit determines the measure of
the deformation depending on the ratio of the duration (ti
1
, ti
2
, ti
n
) of the
pulse (I) to the duration (t
u
) of a revolution of the wheel.
A device according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 one pulse (I) is
delivered per revolution of the wheel.
A device according to Claim 2, 
characterised in that
 the number of the
pulses (I) is captured over the operating life of the tyre.
A device according to one of the Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that

the sensor (PE) is applied on or in a zone of the tyre, which is deformed

during a pass of its region of contact with the tyre.
A device according to one of the Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that

the sensor (PE) is a piezo element.
A device according to one of the Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that

the evaluation unit is built into the motor vehicle in a fixed position and
the pulse (I) is transmitted without wires to the evaluation unit.
A device according to one of the Claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that

the sensor (PE) is connected to a transmitter (ÜE) for the wireless 
transmission of the pulse (I).
A device according to one of the Claims 6 to 7, 
characterised in that

the piezo element (PE) is utilised for the electrical supply to the
transmitter (ÜE).
