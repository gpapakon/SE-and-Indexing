<ABSTRACT>
A facsimile in which environmental conditions in 
the vicinity of a recording section 3 for recording a 

received image are detected by an environmental 
condition detecting section 11. A control section 7 

judges whether or not the environmental conditions are 
within an operation ensuring environment range of the 

recording section 3 on the basis of the results of the 
detection. When image information is received under 

environmental conditions outside the operation 
ensuring environment range, the recording operation by 

the recording section 3 is inhibited, and the received 
image information is stored in a memory 5. When the 

environmental conditions detected by the environmental 
condition detecting section 11 subsequently come back 

within the operation ensuring environment range, the 
image information is read out from the memory 5, and 

is recorded on paper sheets by the recording section 
3.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to facsimiles. A facsimile is an apparatus for transmitting and receiving an 
image on a document or the like, and comprises a document 
reading section for reading the document to be transmitted, a 
recording section for recording the received image, and a 
control section for controlling operations of respective 
sections of the facsimile. Conventionally, a thermo-sensitive 
recording system has been widely employed for the recording 
section for recording the received image. In recent years, 
however, an electrostatic recording system for recording an 
image in accordance with an electrophotographic process has 
been employed. The electrostatic recording system is a 
recording system for writing an electrostatic latent image 
corresponding to a received image into a photoreceptor, 
developing the electrostatic latent image into a toner image, 
and transferring and fixing the toner image on paper sheets. For example, if a problem occurs problems, such as the problem 
that the supply of paper sheets in the recording section runs out, it 
is impossible to record the received image, resulting in a 
state where receiving is impossible. In order to solve the 
problem, therefore, the facsimile may, in some cases, have a 
so-called representing receiving function. The representing 
receiving function includes the operation of storing the received image  
 
in a memory provided for the facsimile for use in cases such as the case 
where a problem occurs in the recording section. The 
received image received by the representing receiving function 
and stored in the memory is read out at the time point where 
the function of the recording section is restored and is 
recorded on the paper sheets. An operation ensuring environment range is generally 
defined for the facsimile. The operation ensuring environment 
range is a range of environmental conditions, such as 
"temperatures of 10°C to 32.5°C and humidity of 20 % to 80 %". 
If the facsimile is used outside the operation ensuring 
environment range, mechanical troubles and degradation of the 
quality of the recorded image may occur. For example, if the facsimile is caused to perform a 
recording operation under high humidity, a paper jam due to 
moisture absorption of the paper sheets may occur. In 
addition, if the facsimile is caused to perform a recording 
operation under cryogenic temperatures, a gear made of resin 
in a paper conveying mechanism may become cracked. Further, 
particularly in a facsimile having a recording

<CLAIMS>
A facsimile which receives image information 
and records the received image information on paper 

sheets and which includes a storing means (5) capable 
of storing the received image information, 

characterised by: 
   environmental condition detecting means (11) for 

detecting environmental conditions in the vicinity of 
the facsimile; and 

   control means (7) adapted to cause said storing 
means (5) to store the received image and to cause the 

received image information not to be recorded on the 
paper sheets when it is judged that the environmental 

conditions in the vicinity of the facsimile are 
unsuitable for an operation on the basis of the output 

of the environmental condition detecting means (11). 
A facsimile according to claim 1, wherein 
said control means (7) is arranged to cause the 

recording means to record the image information stored 
in the storing means (5) when it is judged that the 

environmental conditions in the vicinity of the 
facsimile are suitable for operation on the basis of 

the output of the environmental condition detecting 
means (1), after the received image information is 

stored in the storing means (5). 
A facsimile according to claim 1 or 2, 
comprising a recording unit (3, 3A, 3B) for recording 

the received image information in accordance with an 
electrophotographic process. 
A facsimile according to claim 3, wherein 
said environmental condition detecting means (11) is 

adapted to detect the environmental conditions in the 
vicinity of the recording means (3, 3A, 3B). 
A facsimile according to claim 4, wherein 
said environmental condition detecting means (11) 

comprises a temperature sensor. 
A facsimile according to claim 4 or 5, 
wherein said environmental condition detecting means 

(11) comprises a humidity sensor. 
A facsimile according to claim 6, wherein 
said control means (7) is adapted to judge that the 

environmental conditions are suitable for an operation 
when the temperature detected by the temperature 

sensor is within a predetermined temperature range, 
and the humidity detected by the humidity sensor is

that the environmental conditions are unsuitable for 

an operation when the temperature detected by the 
temperature sensor or the humidity detected by the 

humidity sensor is outside the predetermined range.
