<ABSTRACT>
A modulation apparatus for converting digital data having the basic data length equal to 

m
 bits into a variable length code (d, k; m, n; r) having the basic codeword length of 
n
 
bits is disclosed. The apparatus includes an encoder (12) for determining the constraint 

length 
i
 of data supplied from a shift register (11), based upon 
m
 bits as a unit, a 
selector (13), plural conversion tables (14
i
) and an unfixed bit processing circuit (16
i
). 
The selector (13) selects one of the conversion tables (14
i
) based upon the constraint 
length 
i
 and transmits 
m
 x i bit data to the selected conversion table (14
i
), which then 
converts the m x i bit data into n x i bit codewords. The unfixed bit processing circuit 

(16
i
) sets a bit at a preset position of a codeword among the codewords which gives an 
infinite value ∞ of the maximum run, or a bit at a preset position of a codeword among 

the codewords which has the maximum number of consecutive "0"s from the least 
significant bit towards upper order side bits, as being an unfixed bit, and sets the 

unfixed bit to "1" if 
d
 or more "0"s are consecutive to the unfixed bit. With the present 
modulation appar
atus, the minimum length between transitions T
min
 may be enlarged as 
compared to that in EFM for increasing the recording density, while the maximum 

length of transitions T
max
 may also be increased as compared to that for VFM.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a modulating method and a
demodulating apparatus and, more particularly, to a modulating
method for modulating data so as to be suited to transmission or
recording of data on a recording medium and a demodulation
apparatus for reproducing the data by demodulating the modulated
coded data resulting from the demodulation.When transmitting the data or recording the data on the
recording medium, such as a magneto-optical disc or an optical
disc, the data are modulated so as to be suited for transmission
or recording. Block coding has been known as one of such
modulating techniques. The block coding consists in blocking a
data string into units (data words) each consisting of m × i bits
and translating the data words into codewords, each consisting
of n × i bits, in accordance with an appropriate coding rule. The
block coding becomes a fixed length code if i = 1 and becomes a
variable length code if i = 1 and if i may assume plural values,
that is if i ≥ 1, with the maximum value of i being imax = r).
The code produced by block coding is termed the variable length
code (d, k; m, n; r), where i is termed a constraint length, with
imax being equal to the maximum constraint length r, d is the
minimum number of the same consecutive symbols, that is a so-called
minimum run of 0's, and k is the maximum number of the 
same consecutive symbols, that is a so-called maximum run of 0's.When recording the variable length code on, for example, an
optical disc, it is modulated into so-called non-return to zero
code (NRZ code) and recorded based upon the NRZ modulated
variable length code, referred to hereinafter as the recording
waveform data string. With the minimum length between
transitions and the maximum length between transitions of the
recording waveform data string being Tmin and Tmax, respectively,
it is desirable from the viewpoint of the recording density that
the minimum length between transitions Tmin be long, that is that
the minimum run d be large, while it is desirable from the
viewpoint of clock reproduction and jitter that the maximum
length between transitions Tmax be short, that is that the maximum
run k be small. A variety of modulation methods have been
proposed with which the above conditions are met.In the case of an optical disc having audio data recorded
thereon, that is a so-called compact disc (CD), a so-called
eight-to-fourteen modulation (EFM) is employed. This modulation
method is a variable length code (2, 10; 8, 17; 1) in which, if
the interval between bits (bit
