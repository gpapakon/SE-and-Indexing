<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a sample and hold arrangement to 
sample an input signal comprising at least an operational amplifier 
having an inverting input, a non-inverting input connected to a 
reference voltage (or ground) and an output, a first capacitor one 
side of which may be connected through a first switch to the input 
voltage, a second capacitor one side of which may be connected to 
the output of the operational amplifier through a second switch. Such an arrangement is known from US-A-4,439,693. The operation 
of this known arrangement will be first discussed referring 
to figures 1a and b, which are derived from figures 3a and b of 
said patent pubiication. The known arrangement has as an objective 
to prevent that the offset voltage at the input of the operational 
amplifier 10 influences the output signal Vout of the sample and 
hold arrangement. Therefore, the prior art arrangement performs two 
steps. In the first step (figure 1a) the output and the inverting 
input of the operational amplifier 10 are connected to one another 
and the resulting offset voltage of the operational amplifier is 
stored on both the first capacitor Cin and the second capacitor CF. 
The first capacitor Cin is connected between the inverting input 
and the input voltage to be sampled, while the second capacitor CF 
is at that moment connected between the inverting input and the 
reference voltage (or ground). In the second step the direct connection 
44 between the output and the inverting input of the operational 
amplifier is disconnected and the second capacitor CF is 
connected between the output and the inverting input of the operational 
amplifier. Thereby, a voltage of equal magnitude as the 
offset voltage but having opposite polarity as the original offset 
voltage is added to the offset voltage present at the input of the 
operational amplifier, in such a way that the influence of the 
offset voltage is neutralized. Consequently, in this prior art arrangement the output voltage 
of the circuit is made equal to the offset voltage during the 
compensation phase. Because just before the previous sample is 
still at the output, the output voltage, therefore, generally has 
to make a large voltage step. Therefore, higher demands have to be  
 
met regarding the rate of the operational amplifier applied. Furthermore, 
as the output voltage of the prior art circuit is equal 
to the offset voltage during the compensation phase no continuous-time 
low pass filter can be applied to reconstruct the original 
signal
