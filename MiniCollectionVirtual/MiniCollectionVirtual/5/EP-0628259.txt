<ABSTRACT>
A method of manufacturing preserved food, being improved in the prevention of a change in the taste and color of the 
food which does not permit the use of a deoxidizer therefor and which need have the softness and shape thereof retained, and 

having prolonged palatable period. The method consists of a packing step, an evacuating step, a gas filling and sealing step and a 
heat treatment step. In the packing step, food is packed in a container, such as a bag having a high gas barrier property and, in 

the evacuating step, the air is discharged from the container. In the subsequent gas filling and sealing step, the evacuated container 
is filled with an inert gas and then sealed, so that the food in the container is out of contact with oxygen owing to the container 

of a high gas barrier property. In the next heat treatment step, the food is heated as such, so that the sterilization effect owing to 
the heat applied to the food is improved.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to method of preserving 
foods, particularly method of keeping cooked foods such as 
boiled foods, "tempura", pork fritters or other daily fares 
in good condition or from decay for a long time while being 
marketed at normal temperature. As for the preserving of dried foods such as peanut or 
of cakes such as "manjyu" or sponge cakes containers 
containing these foods are evacuated and filled with an inert 
gas, and sometimes an oxygen scavenger is added to remove 
oxygen in the containers. As for "tukudani" or preserved foods boiled down in soy 
these foods are put in bags, which are filled with an inert 
gas to keep them in good condition or from decay for a long 
time. Cooked foods are wrapped with gas impervious film, and 
then, the so wrapped foods are heated in a high-pressure 
steam vessel for steri lization. These ready-to-eat foods 
are called "retorted foods". Oxygen scavengers, however, cannot be used in  
 
containers containing boiled foods soaked in liquid, and 
therefore, these foods are liable to degrade in taste or 
discolor, and cannot be preserved well for a long time. As for "retorted foods" these preserved foods are kept 
for a long time. Vacuum evacuation of sealed packages causes 
the softness and pleasing shape of foods to be lost. 
Therefore, such foods having pleasing shape or softness 
cannot be "retorted". In view of these one object of the present invention is 
to provide a food preserving method which can keep foods, 
particularly boiled foods soaked in liquid (and hence, use of 
oxygen scavengers not permitted) or foods having pleasing 
shape and/or softness in good condition for a long time, 
guaranteed free of distasting or discoloration of preserved 
foods. To attain this object a method of preserving foods 
according to the present invention comprises the steps of: 
putting foods in gas impermeable containers; evacuating air 
from the containers filled with such foods; filling the 
containers thus evacuated with an inert gas; and heating the 
containers thus filled with the inert gas. First, foods are put in gas impermeable containers, and 
then, the containers are evacuated to take air away from the 
containers filled with such foods. At the subsequent gas-filling 
step the evacuated containers are filled with an 
inert gas, and the gas-filled containers are hermetically 
sealed, thus preventing the contained foods from contacting 
oxygen. Finally, at the heating step the gas-filled 
containers are heated to sterilize the contained
