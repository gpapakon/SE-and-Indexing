<ABSTRACT>
To allocate channels in a mobile radio system, a combined fixed and dynamic channel allocation is carried out. For this purpose, at least one frequency (F) is fixedly predetermined in the mobile radio system and a number of frequencies (D) is provided for dynamic allocation. When a channel is allocated, the useful signal level measured in the currently used channel and the interference level measured in the other channels is used as assessment criterion for the selection.

Method for assigning channels in a mobile radio
system having two or more radio cells (C), each of

which has at least one associated base radio station
(BTS), in which the base radio stations (BTS) of two or

more cells (C) can each be connected to a base station
controller (BSC), in which radio links can be set up on

two or more channels between the mobile stations (MS)
and the base radio stations (BTS), two or more of which

channels (FC) are predetermined in a fixed manner, at
least one channel (DC) can be assigned dynamically and

at least one channel is intended for transmission of
control information for which an attempt is first of

all made to select a channel on a fixed predetermined
frequency (F) and for which, if no channel is available

at this fixed predetermined frequency (F), a channel is
selected at a frequency (D) which can be assigned

dynamically,
characterized in that

when assigning a channel (FC, DC), the useful signal
level which is measured on a currently used channel and

the interference level which is measured on the free
channels (FC, DC) are used as an assessment criterion

such that the selected channel has a signal-to-noise
ratio (C/I) which is adequate for transmission.
Method according to Claim 1, in which at least one
of the fixed predetermined channels (FC) is reserved 

for a handover, 
characterized in that
, when selecting a
channel, care is taken to ensure that all the

frequencies (F, D) can be used by the base station
(BS), but only a restricted number of frequencies can

be used at the same time.
Method according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, in which
at least one of the channels is reserved for a

handover, 
characterized in that
, if no channel (DC)
which can be assigned dynamically is available, a

channel (H) which is reserved for the handover is
selected.
Method according to Claim 3, in which two or more
channels (H) which can be used for a handover are

reserved, 
characterized in that
 the poorest channel (H)
which is reserved for the handover is selected.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 4,

characterized in that
 an attempt is first of all made
to assign the channel with the best quality to the

fixed predetermined frequency (F).
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 5, in which
a handover in the form of an intracell-handover can be

carried out within a radio cell, 
characterized in that

the handover is carried out only when the expected

error rate in the newly assigned channel (FC, DC) is
lower than in the previous channel.
Method according to one of the preceding claims,

characterized in that
 the error rate to be expected is
determined by means of a conversion table from the C/I

ratio estimated for the new channel.
Method according to one of the preceding claims,
in which a handover in the form of an intercell-handover 

can be carried out between the radio cells,

characterized in that
 a channel is selected at a
frequency (D) which can be assigned dynamically only

when the quality which can be expected at this
frequency is better than that of the best channel at

the fixed frequency (F).
Method according to one of the preceding claims,

characterized in that
 a channel at a frequency (D)
which can be assigned dynamically is selected only when

its interference level is lower than that of the best
channel at a fixed frequency (F).
Method according to one of the preceding claims,
in which two or more frequencies (D) are provided, on

which channels (DC) which can be assigned dynamically
can be accommodated, 
characterized in that
 a channel at
a frequency (D) which has already been predetermined is

assigned first of all, before a new frequency (D) is
used.
Method according to Claim 10, 
characterized in
that
 a new frequency (D) is selected by looking for the
time slot with the highest interference level at each

frequency, and then selecting that frequency of those
which in each case have the highest interference levels

which has the lowest interference levels.
Method according to one of the preceding claims,
in which a channel is allocated from a frequency with

few used channels to a frequency with a large number of
used channels in the form of a reallocation process,


characterized in that
 the channel which is moved is
that which is at a frequency (D) with a small number of

used channels. 
Method according to Claim 12, 
characterized in
that
 the channel which is moved is that which is at a
frequency (D) with the smallest number of used

channels.
Method according to Claim 12 or 13, 
characterized
in that
 the channel is moved to a channel at the fixed
predetermined frequency (F).
Method according to one of Claims 12 to 14,

characterized in that
 the channel is moved to the best
channel which is not reserved for a handover.
Method according to Claim 15, 
characterized in
that
 the channel is moved to a channel (DC) whose
quality is at least the same at a frequency (D) with

more used time slots.
Method according to Claim 12, 
characterized in
that
 an attempt is first of all made to move the
channel to the best channel which is not reserved for a

handover and 
in that
, if this is not possible, the
channel is then moved to a free channel at the fixed

predetermined frequency (F) and 
in that
, if none of
this is possible, the channel is moved to the best

channel (DC) at a frequency (D) which can be assigned
dynamically and which has already been assigned.
Method according to one of the preceding claims,

characterized in that
 the process of selecting a
channel (FC, DC) is terminated as soon as the measured

interference level falls below a predetermined
threshold value.
Mobile radio system having two or more mobile
stations (MS) and two or more base stations (BS), in

which radio connections can be set up between the 
mobile stations (MS) and the base stations (BS) on two

or more channels, of which two or more channels (FC)
are predetermined in a fixed manner, at least one

channel (DC) can be assigned dynamically and at least
one channel is intended for transmission of control

information, in which the base station (BS) is designed
such that it first of all attempts to select a channel

at a fixed predetermined frequency (F) and such that,
if no channel is available at this fixed predetermined

frequency (F), it selects a channel at a frequency (D)
which can be assigned dynamically,
characterized in that

the base station (BS) is designed such that, when
assigning a channel (FC, DC) it uses the useful signal

level which is measured on a currently used channel and
the interference level which is measured on the free

the selected channel has a signal-to-noise ratio (C/I)

which is sufficient for transmission.
