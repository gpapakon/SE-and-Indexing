<ABSTRACT>
This device includes an input port (10) for a digital code defining the frequency to be synthesised and an accumulator circuit (15) for accumulating in the form of numbers the said digital codes in succession in tempo with the signals from a cumulation clock. The device also includes an accumulation decoder (25) which, coupled to the said accumulator circuit (15), delivers a cumulation datum relating to the number accumulated in this accumulator circuit and a variable divider circuit (40) driven by this cumulation datum so as to deliver, from the signals of a reference clock (45), the signals with synthesised frequency. Application: data transmission.

Frequency synthesis device comprising an input
port (10) for a digital code defining the frequency to

be synthesized and an accumulator circuit (15) for
accumulating in the form of numbers the said digital

codes successively in tempo with the signals of an
accumulating clock,

characterized in that it comprises a logic gate of the
EXCLUSIVE-OR type (25), which, coupled with the said

accumulator circuit, provides a cue indicating the
changing of the value of the highest order binary

element of the number accumulated in the said
accumulator circuit and a variable divider circuit (40)

driven by this cue so as to provide, on the basis of
the signals of a reference clock, the signals of

synthesized frequency, the said variable divider
circuit (40) being formed of two fixed divider circuits

(51, 52) and of a switch (54) for selecting one or
other of the said fixed divider circuits as a function

of the function of the cue supplied by the said logic
gate (15).
Frequency synthesis device comprising an input

(40') being formed of a fixed divider circuit (60) and

of means of inversion (62, 65, 67) for inverting the
signals of the reference clock.
Frequency synthesis device according to Claim 1
or 2, characterized in that the signals of the

accumulating clock are constructed on the basis of the
signals of synthesized frequency.
Frequency synthesis device according to Claims
1 to 3, characterized in that the accumulator circuit

(25) is formed of an addition circuit (20) furnished
with two operand inputs (A, B), of which one is linked

to the said input port and the other to the outputs of
an accumulating register of the accumulator circuit.
