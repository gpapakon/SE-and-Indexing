<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a lubricant oil
composition. More particularly, the present invention
is concerned with a lubricant oil composition for use
in a refrigeration system, specifically a refrigeration
system in which, from the viewpoint of the environmental
protection, substitute refrigerants are used for
chlorine-containing refrigerants, such as CFC-12 (1,1-dichloro-1,1-difluoromethane)
and HCFC-22 (chlorodifluoromethane),
which are likely to destroy the ozone
layer. Examples of substitute refrigerants include:
(1) fluoroalkanes, particularly lower hydrocarbons
having 1 to 5 carbon atoms, such as HFC-134a (1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane),
HFC-134 (1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethane),
HFC-152a (1,1-difluoroethane), HFC-32 (difluoromethane),
HFC-125 (pentafluoroethane), HFC-143a (1,1,1-trifluoroethane)
and HFC-227ea (1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane),
which do not damage the ozone layer; (2) hydrofluoroethers
(HFE) (hereinafter frequently referred to 
simply as "HFE"), which do not damage the ozone layer
and, in addition, are expected to lower the GWP (Global
Warming Potential); (3) mixtures of the refrigerants
mentioned under (1) and (2) above.CFC-12 is still currently, widely used as a refrigerant
in refrigeration equipment for car air conditioners
and refrigerators, while HCFC-22 is widely used
as a refrigerant in refrigeration equipment for room
air conditioners. However, development of a refrigerant
which can be used in substitution for chlorine-containing
refrigerants, such as CFC-12 and HCFC-22, has been
desired from the viewpoint of the protection of the
ozone layer.As substitute refrigerants, the above-mentioned
lower hydrofluorocarbons having 1 to 5 carbon atoms are
promising. Of these, hydrofluorocarbons having 1 to 2
carbon atoms are particularly preferred.In conventional refrigeration systems using CFC-12
or HCFC-22, mineral oil or alkylbenzene is used as a
lubricant for a compressor of the refrigeration system.
CFC-12 and HCFC-22 exhibit high oleophilicity since
they contain chlorine atoms, so that they are miscible
with mineral oil and alkylbenzene over a wide temperature
range. Accordingly, even in the refrigeration 
systems where evaporation and condensation of the
refrigerant are repeated, phase separation of CFC-12 or
HCFC-22 as the refrigerant from the lubricant does not
occur.However, various types of hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants
(hereinafter frequently referred to simply
as "HFC refrigerants") and HFE refrigerants are not
satisfactorily miscible with hydrocarbon compounds,
such as
