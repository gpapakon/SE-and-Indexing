<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a degaussing system for kinescopes, 
particularly apt for use in situations wherein kinescopes are subjected 
to variable magnetic fields, utilising a damped oscillating circuit. It is known that in degaussing systems for kinescopes a current passes 
through the degaussing coils taken from the electric mains supply, the 
amplitude of which is annulled over a certain time, thus subjecting the 
holed mask with hysteresis cycles being increasingly weaker until they 
are annulled. This process must take place in a gradual manner and cover a certain 
period of time because, if the current were to be suddenly reduced to 
zero, a residual magnetism would remain and the purpose would not be 
reached. The system mostly used for obtaining a current whose amplitude is 
progressively reduced consists in the use, in series to the degaussing 
coils, of a positive resistor coefficient (PTC), which, being heated 
increases its resistance, gradually decreasing the value of the current, to 
negligible values, over a period of 20-30 seconds. For its cooling, and thus returning to its initial conditions, the PTC 
requires however approximately 10-15 minutes; this does not represent 
a problem for kinescopes used in fixed positions, for example in normal 
domestic televisions, for which a single daily degaussing is sufficient,  
 
upon turning the apparatus on for the first time. This is not so for 
televisions arranged on movable supports (for example rotary video 
walls), or casually located in the vicinity of variable magnetic fields. In 
such cases the degaussing must be more frequent, in certain cases even 
once a minute. It is clear that in such conditions a PTC system cannot be used, as it 
would not have sufficient time for cooling down from one degaussing 
operation to the next. Oscillating circuits L-C can be used in such cases i.e. made up of an 
inductance L (in practice that of the degaussing bobbins) and a capacitor 
C, which is periodically charged with a continuous voltage V, and that 
discharges on the inductance L, producing a damped oscillation; the 
higher the coil resistance the faster the dampening. The usual resistance value of degaussing coils is 20-30 ohm; using a 
capacity capacitor not being too large, the oscillation dampens much too 
quickly, after a couple of cycles; bringing about a residual magnetisation 
as a consequence, and, after several degaussing operations, the 
kinescope becomes spotted. For over coming this drawback a high capacity capacitor and low
