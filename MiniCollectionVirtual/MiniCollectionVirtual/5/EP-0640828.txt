<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to detecting nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) amplification,
and more particularly to real-time monitoring of multiple nucleic acid amplification reactions,
simultaneously. The invention also relates to a method for using the accumulated data to
quantitate the starting concentration of a target nucleic acid sequence provided in one or more
of the mixtures and monitor the effect of amplification reaction conditions on the reaction
kinetics.Various methods for detecting nucleic acid amplification are known. A number of
assays are known which quantitate the number of starting DNA templates in a polymerase
chain reaction (PCR), for example. Some involve the measurement of PCR product at the
end of temperature thermal cycling and relate this level to the starting DNA concentration.
Such an "endpoint" analysis, as has been typically done using PCR, reveals the presence or
absence of target DNA but generally does not provide a usable measure of the starting
number of DNA targets.Other assays involve the use of a competitor amplification product whose template is
added at known concentration to the reaction mixture before thermal cycling. In competitor-product
protocols, an aliquot of the amplification is examined by gel-electrophoresis.
The
relative amount of target-specific and competitor PCR product is measured; this ratio is used
to calculate the starting number of target templates. The larger the ratio of target-specific
product to competitor-specific product, the higher the starting DNA concentration.In addition to requiring "downstream" processing, such as hybridization or gel
electrophoresis, these other assays are more limited in dynamic range (i.e., sensitivity to a
range of target nucleic acid concentrations). In competitor assays, the sensitivity to template
concentration differences is compromised when either the target or added competitor DNA is
greatly in excess of the other. The dynamic range of assays that measure the amount of end
product can also be limited in that at the chosen number of cycles some reactions may have
reached a "plateau" level of product. Differences in starting template levels in these reactions
are therefore not well reflected. Furthermore, small differences in the measured amount of
product result in widely varying estimates of the starting template concentration, leading to
great inaccuracy due to variable reaction conditions, variations in sampling, or the presence
of inhibitors. Optimization of PCR conditions typically is accomplished by
