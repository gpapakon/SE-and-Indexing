<ABSTRACT>
A pneumatic power drill comprises a piston (13) reciprocal in a cylinder (12) defined within a cylindrical casing (11) of the tool. A bit (14) is actuable by the piston and means are provided by supplying air and pressure alternatively to opposite sides of the piston to reciprocate the piston in the cylinder. A handle (20) is slidably attached to the casing, resilient connection means being provided between the handle and the casing. The resilient connection means comprise a spring (46) and an air damper formed by compressed air filling a space around spring (46). The resilient connection means ensure that, in use, the vibration transmitted to the handle from the tool is substantially reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
 IMPROVEMENTS IN PNEUMATIC POWERTOOLSThe invention relates to pneumatic power tools, particularly reciprocating pneumatic power tools of the type comprising a piston which reciprocates, in use, in a cylinder, means being provided to supply air under pressure alternately to opposite sides of the piston to cause the reciprocating motion. A tool or operating bit mounted in the power tool is acted on by the piston. Such a tool may, for example, be a chisel bit and a typical use of such a power tool is as a chipper in which the reciprocating motion of the piston causes the chisel bit to be hammered into a surface on which the tool is being used.Such pneumatic power tools are provided with a handle for a user of the tool and, in prior art devices, the handle is traditionally fixed rigidly to the cylinder or casing of the tool. This arrangement has a substantial disadvantage in that the vibration caused by the reciprocation of the piston in the cylinder is transmitted directly to the handle and thence to the hand and arm of a user of the tool. Significant periods of use of such a tool can cause a complaint known as vibration white finger, a symptom of which is the fingers of the user turning white and the long term effects of which can be very serious to the user.The present invention seeks to reduce this disadvantage of traditional reciprocating pneumatic power tools by providing such a tool in which the vibration transmitted to the handle is substantially reduced. The invention provides a pneumatic power tool comprising a piston reciprocable in a cylinder defined within a casing of the tool, a tool actuable by the piston, means for supplying air under pressure alternatively to opposite sides of the piston to reciprocate the piston in the cylinder and a handle slidably attached to the casing 

resilient connection means being provided between the handle and the casing whereby, in use, the vibration transmitted to the handle is substantiallly reduced, in which the resilient connection means includes an air damper arranged between the handle and the casing.The resilient connecting means preferably further comprises a spring located between the handle and the casing.A valve may be provided comprising a piston like valve member sliding in a cylindrical valve body, relative axial movement between the handle and" the casing causing the valve member to move between a first position in which a passage through or past the valve member allows a bleed of inlet air to be provided to the piston and cylinder arrangement

CLAIMS:
1. A pneumatic power tool comprising a piston reciprocable in a cylinder defined within a casing of the tool, a tool actuable by the piston, means for supplying air under pressure alternatively to opposite sides of the piston to reciprocate the piston in the cylinder and a handle slidably attached to the casing, resilient connection means being provided between the handle and the casing whereby, in use, the vibration transmitted to the handle is substantiallly reduced, in which the resilient connection means includes an air damper arranged between the handle and the casing.
2. A power tool as claimed in claim 1 in which the resilient connection means further comprises a spring located between the handle and the casing.
3. A power tool as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 in which a valve is provided comprising a piston like valve member sliding in a cylindrical valve body, relative axial movement between the handle and the casing causing the valve member to move between a first position in which a passage through or past the valve member allows a bleed of inlet air to be provided to the piston and cylinder arrangement and a second position in which a full flow of inlet air is provided to the piston and cylinder arrangement.
4. A power tool as claimed in claim 3 in which the valve member includes a radial flange which is a close fit 


in the cylindrical valve member and in which the bleed is provided by a flat formed on the radial flange.
5. A power tool as claimed in claim 3 or claim 4 in which the air damper is provided by the valve member and valve body, inlet air being provided to the interior of the valve body to act on the valve member.
6. A power tool as claimed in any of the proceeding claims further comprising a sleeve extending around the piston and cylinder arrangement, the sleeve being resiliently mounted on the tool.
7. A power tool as claimed in claim 6 in which the sleeve is supported by a resilient mounting fixed to the casing and is coupled to a portion of the tool by a quick release coupling.
