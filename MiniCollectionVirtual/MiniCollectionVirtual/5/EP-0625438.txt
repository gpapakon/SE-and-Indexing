<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a stud link for tyre chains having a link body (1) with receiving openings (2; 3) for the connection of connecting links and on its upper side having profiled bumps (5) which lie one behind another in the longitudinal direction and are bounded on their mutually facing sides by a respective sloping flank face, which is directed transversely with respect to the longitudinal direction of the link body (1), the flank faces (6; 7) of mutually facing sides each diverging away in the direction of the face (4) for resting against the tyre. In the case of a stud link of this type, the profiled bumps (5) are designed in cross-section as triangles which directly adjoin one another and the points (8) and bases (9) of which each lie in a common plane (E-E; F-F). They extend essentially over the entire width (C) of the link body which is furthermore provided on its two longitudinal sides with lateral projections (10) which likewise lie one behind another, are likewise triangular in cross-section and protrude outwards. The projections (10) are offset by about 90@ with respect to the profiled bumps (5) and lie with their upper, lateral end faces (15) in a plane (A-A) running at the level of the common plane (F-F) of the bases (9) of the profiled bumps (5), or somewhat below this plane.

Stud link for tyre chains, comprising a link body having at least one locating 
opening for the connection of connecting links and provided on its side remote 

from the tyre bearing surface with profiled elevations situated one behind the other 
in the longitudinal direction of the stud link and delimited at their sides directed 

towards one another by an oblique flank surface aligned transversely to the 
longitudinal direction of the stud link, the flank surfaces of sides of successive 

profiled elevations directed towards one another diverging away from the tyre 
bearing surface, characterised in that, when viewed in cross section in the 

longitudinal direction of the link body (1), the profiled elevations (5) are in the 
form of immediately adjacent triangles, the vertices (8) and bases (9) of which are 

situated in one common plane (E-E; F-F) and extend substantially over the entire 
width (C) of the upper surface of the link body (1), and that lateral projections 

(10) of identical height (h) having a triangular cross section also situated one 
behind the other are formed on both longitudinal sides of the link body (1) at least 

in a central longitudinal region thereof so that they project outwardly from the 
respective side surfaces of the link body (1), said projections being arranged so 

that they are offset by substantially 90Â° relative to the profiled elevations (5) and 
their top lateral end surfaces (15) being situated in a plane (A-A) extending level 

with or slightly below the common plane (F-F) of the bases (9) of the profiled 
elevations (5). 
Stud link according to claim 1, characterised in that the vertices (8) of the profiled 
elevations (5) and/or the vertices (11) of the lateral projections (10) have a 

rounded cross section. 
Stud link according to claim 1 or claim 2, characterised in that the profiled 
elevations (5) are of identical size. 
Stud link according to claim 3, characterised in that the profiled elevations (5) 
and/or the projections (10) are each of identical shape.  

 
Stud link according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the profiled 
elevations (5) are arranged perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis (L-L) of the 

link body (1). 
Stud link according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the profiled 
elevations (5) are arranged obliquely relative to the longitudinal axis (L-L) of the 

link body (1). 
Stud link according to one of claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the cross sections 
of the profiled elevations (5) and/or the projections (10) are isosceles triangles. 
Stud link according to one of claims 1 to 7, characterised in that intermediate 
elevations (12) are fitted between the side flanks (6, 7) of at least two successive 

profiled elevations (5) directed towards one another, the upper vertices (13) of 
which are also situated in the common plane (E-E) of the vertices (8) of the 

profiled elevations (5) and are shorter than the profiled elevations (5). 
Stud link according to claim 8, characterised in that the intermediate elevations 
(12) are provided in the central region
 of the extent (C) of the profiled elevations 
(5). 
Stud link according to claim 8, characterised in that the intermediate elevations 
(12) extend from one side of the link body (1). 
Stud link according to claim 8, characterised in that the intermediate elevations 
(12) are fitted so that they extend alternately from either side of the link body (1). 
Stud link according to one of claims 8 to 11, characterised in that, when viewed in 
cross section in the longitudinal direction of the link body (1), the intermediate 

elevations (12) extend upwards in a triangle with a vertex angle which is smaller 
than or equal to the vertex angle of the profiled elevations (5).

extent (c) of the intermediate elevations (12) is only approximately 20 % to 80 %,
