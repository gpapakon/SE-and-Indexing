<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a motor-vehicle door lock with a preferably angular carrier plate (2) which has an entry slot (1) for a locking hook and consists of metal, with locking elements, such as a lock latch (3) and detent pawl (4), mounted on the carrier plate (2), with a locking mechanism having various operating levers (5), and with a case (6) produced in one piece from, if appropriate, fibre-reinforced plastic in a shaping production process and firmly connected, especially screwed, to the carrier plate (2). This motor-vehicle door lock is further optimised in terms of cost, in that the housing (6) is designed with a metal closing plate arranged on the rear side facing away from the carrier plate (2) and also all the operating levers (5) of the locking mechanism are mounted primarily on the case (6), if appropriate also on or supported by the carrier plate (2).

Motor vehicle door lock, with a carrier plate (2)
having an entry slot (1) for a locking hook and consisting

of metal, locking elements, such as a lock latch (3)
and detent pawl (4), mounted on the carrier plate (2),

and a locking mechanism having various operating levers
(5), with a housing (6) produced in one piece from

plastic in a forming production process and fixedly
connected to the carrier plate (2), the housing being

designed without a cover plate arranged on the rear side
facing away from the carrier plate (2), and all the

operating levers (5) of the locking mechanism being
mounted primarily on the housing (6), if appropriate also

on or with the support of the carrier plate (2), characterized
in that the locking mechanism has a pneumatic

actuating drive with an actuating drive cylinder (8) made
of plastic and the actuating drive cylinder (8) is formed

in one piece with the housing (6), or in that the locking
mechanism has an electric actuating drive with an actuating

drive housing made of plastic and the actuating drive
housing is formed in one piece with the housing.
Motor vehicle door lock according to Claim 1,
characterized in that there is provided on the housing

(6) at least one angularly projecting carrying arm (9)
which cooperates preferably with an actuating element

(10) of the actuating drive.
Motor vehicle door lock according to Claims 1 or
2, characterized in that the housing (6) is provided with

sockets (11) for plastic bearing pins.
