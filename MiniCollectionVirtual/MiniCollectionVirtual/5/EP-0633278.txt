<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel reaction product 
additive composition for use in motor fuels. The additive 
comprises the imide reaction product obtained by reacting a 
hydrocarbyl-substituted dibasic acid anhydride with a random 
backbone polyoxyalkylene diamine to produce a motor fuel - 
soluble bisimide which provides a number of valuable 
properties in a motor fuel composition. The combustion of a hydrocarbon motor fuel in an 
internal combustion engine leads to the formation and 
accumulation of deposits on various parts of the combustion 
chamber as well as on the fuel intake and exhaust system of 
the engine. The presence of deposits in the combustion 
chamber seriously reduces the operating efficiency of the 
engine. First, deposit accumulation within the combustion 
chamber inhibits heat transfer between the chamber and the 
engine cooling system. This leads to higher temperatures 
within the combustion chamber, resulting in increases in the 
end gas temperature of the incoming charge. Consequently, 
end gas auto-ignition occurs, which causes engine knock. In 
addition, the accumulation of deposits within the combustion 
chamber reduces the volume of the combustion zone, causing 
a higher than design compression ratio in the engine. This, 
in turn, can also lead to engine knocking. A knocking 
engine does not effectively utilize the energy of 
combustion. Moreover, a prolonged period of engine knocking 
can cause stress fatigue and wear in pistons, connecting 
rods, bearings and cam rods of the engine. The phenomenon 
noted is characteristic of gasoline powered internal 
combustion engines. It may be overcome by employing a 
higher octane gasoline which resists knocking for powering 
the engine. This need for a higher octane gasoline as 
mileage accumulates has become known as the engine octane 
requirement increase (ORI) phenomenon. It is particularly  
 
advantageous if engine ORI can be substantially reduced or 
eliminated by preventing or modifying deposit formation in 
the combustion chambers of the engine. Another problem common to internal combustion engines 
relates to the accumulation of deposits in the carburetor. 
These deposits tend to restrict the flow of air through the 
carburetor at idle and at low speed resulting in an over-rich 
fuel mixture. This condition also promotes incomplete 
fuel combustion and may lead to rough engine idling and even 
engine stalling. This condition leads to the production of 
excessive hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide exhaust emissions.
