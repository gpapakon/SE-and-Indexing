<ABSTRACT>
A leadframe structure (18) is proposed for use with a molded package 
is 

disclosed. In particular, the structure is suited for arrangements 
where direct 

wirebond attachment sites (12) are exposed through the molding material. 
Conventional 

molding processes often result in leaving a residue (26) of molding 
material on the 

exposed wirebond sites (12). The invention is directed to including a 
protective layer (24) of 

material over the wirebond locations (12) during the leadframe plating 
operation. The 

protective layer (24)(and any molding residue (26) covering the 
protective layer) may then be 

removed using an etchant after the molding operation, exposing the 
underlying 

virgin wirebond contact sites (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a leadframe structure and, more 
particularly, to a leadframe structure useful in molded packaging arrangements. In many current integrated electronic and/or optoelectronic circuit 
arrangements, one or more semiconductor components are positioned on a leadframe 
and encased in a package, so as to form a single in-line package (SIP) or dual in-line 
package (DIP) structure. The package may be, in some cases, molded from a plastic 
to completely encase the circuit components. Typically, electrical signals are 
transmitted to/from such a molded package to the associated circuit board by the 
plurality of leads which comprise the leadframe structure. However, in some cases, 
the need arises to provide a direct electrical contact between the molded package and 
another device without passing through the circuit board (e.g., in situations where the 
signal degradation associated with the circuit board is unacceptable). A problem with the direct wirebond is that an essentially clean wirebond 
contact on the molded package is required to provide the necessary electrical 
connections and mechanical integrity. However, inherent in the molding operation is 
the residue of molding compound (typically, a thermoset resin) which will adhere to 
the exposed wirebond surface. Conventional cleaning agents, which may be capable 
of removing the resin from the exposed gold wirebond pad sites, are not acceptable 
alternatives since they have been found to attack the molded package and/or gold 
wirebond contact area, as well as require a one-at-a-time cleaning process (costly as 
compared to a "batch" cleaning system). A need remains, therefore, for an arrangement capable of improving the 
electrical quality of wirebond attachments to leadframes utilized in molded 
packaging arrangements. The need remaining in the prior art is addressed by the present invention 
which relates to a leadframe structure and, more particularly, to a leadframe structure 
useful in molded packaging arrangements. In accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, 
a conventional copper leadframe (prior to the molding operation) is blanket plated 
with nickel, then selectively plated (in wirebond locations) or blanket plated with 
gold. The gold-plated wirebond areas are subsequently plated with a protective  
 
material (for example, copper). The structure is then over-molded, using any desired 
molding process, often resulting in a portion of the molding resin bleeding over into 
the wirebond
