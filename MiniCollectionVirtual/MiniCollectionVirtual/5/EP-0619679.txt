<ABSTRACT>
In a multi-location television conference system 
that connects five locations A, B, C, D, and E, when 

speeches take place at the four locations A, B, C, and 
D at the same time, at a listening location E, images 

of all the speaking locations A, B, C, and D are 

displayed on one screen with four divided screen 
areas. On the other hand, at the speaking location A, 

images of the speaking locations B, c, and D and an 
image of the former speaking location E are displayed 

on one screen with four divided screen areas. In 
addition, when images of speaking locations are 

displayed, locations names thereof are also displayed. 
Thus, a television conference held at a plurality of 

locations at a time can be smoothly managed as with a 
real conventional conference.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a television
conference system for use in a multi-location
television conference (also called videoconferencing).In recent years, with the advent of ISDN
(Integrated Services Digital Networks), digital
networks have been widely used and television
conference systems have become popular.The television conference systems transmit image
data and sound data among remote locations so as to
hold conferences. Conventional television conference
systems transmit image data and sound data between two
locations (namely, point-to-point connection).
Recently, to more effectively hold conferences, a
multi-location television conference system as shown
in Fig. 1 has gained public attention. The needs of
multi-location television conference systems result
from geographical distribution of offices (such as
main office, works, laboratories, sales offices) of 
companies. In this situation, so as to reduce cost
and time necessary for transmitting information,
people, and materials, television conferences have
been held among television conference terminal units
disposed at remote locations.Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram showing an overall
construction of a multi-location television conference
system that holds a television conference among
conference rooms A, B, C, and D disposed at four
locations.In the drawing, reference numerals 1 to 4 refer
to television conference terminal units disposed at
the four conference rooms. Reference numeral 10
refers to a multi-location control apparatus disposed
at a center station.The television conference terminal units (that
may be hereinafter referred to as terminal units) 1 to
4 each have a camera, a monitor, a microphone, an
encoding unit, and so forth. Thus, the television
conference terminal units each have input and output
functions of image data and sound data. Image data
and sound data of each conference room are sent to the
center unit 10. The center unit 10 sends the image
data and sound data to each of the television
conference terminal units. The center unit 10 receives image data and sound
data from all the conference rooms, mixes all the
sound data, sends the mixed sound data to the
television conference terminal units 1 to 4, and
distributes the image data to all the television
conference terminal units.In this multi-location television conference
system, a monitor of the television conference
terminal unit at each conference room (location)
switches and displays images of other conference rooms
(of at least one location). When a speaking

<CLAIMS>
A multi-location television conference system
having a plurality of television conference terminal

units and comprising:

image distributing means for transmitting image
data to each of said television conference terminal

units for display thereon;

characterised by:
speaking location detecting means for detecting a
speaking location corresponding to sound signals that

are output from sound input means of each of said
television conference terminal units; and
image combining means for designing a layout of a
display area corresponding to the number of speaking

locations for each television conference terminal unit
and generating image data containing images of the

speaking locations to be displayed in the designed
display area of each television conference terminal

unit when a plurality of speaking locations are
detected by said speaking location detecting means;
wherein said image distributing means transmits
image data generated by said image combining means to

each of said television conference terminal units.
The system as set forth in claim 1, wherein
said image combining means generates and transmits the

image data of the speaking locations detected by said
speaking location detecting means to ones of said 

television conference terminal units at listening
locations where sound is not detected by said speaking

location detecting means, the transmitted image data of
all of the speaking locations being simultaneously

displayed on a single screen of each of the television
conference terminal units of the listening locations,

and wherein said image distributing means distributes
the image data of the speaking locations to the

television conference terminal units of the listening
locations.
The system as set forth in claim 1 or 2,

wherein said image combining means generates the
image data of other speaking locations and a former

speaking location for each of the speaking locations,
the image data being contained in one screen of each

speaking location, and
wherein said image distribution means transmits
the image data of the other speaking locations to

television conference terminal units of the speaking
locations.
A multi-location control apparatus for use in
the system as set forth in claim 1, 2, or 3 and

comprising said speaking location detection means, said
image combining means, and said image distributing

means.
