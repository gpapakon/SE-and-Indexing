<ABSTRACT>
A scrambler for scrambling a composite video signal 
comprises a scrambling data generator for generating a number 

of scrambling data. Each of the scrambling data is added to 
each of a corresponding number of digitized video data samples 

converted by an analog-to-digital converter, to thereby 
generate a scrambled video signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for
scrambling and descrambling a video signal; and, more
particularly, to a scrambler for shuffling random data into
digitized video signal samples and a descrambler for removing
the random data from the digitized video signal samples.In subscription television broadcasting systems, there
has been a constant need for a reliable method/device for
scrambling or encrypting television signals at a transmitter
and for descrambling or decoding the scrambled television
signals at a receiver so that the television signals are
protected against an unauthorized access. The above
method/device for scrambling and descrambling the television
signals is gaining its usages with increased frequencies in
commercial applications such as television or satellite
communications. For example, CATV signals are often scrambled
so that a picture being transmitted can only be viewed by the
users having an appropriate or authorized decoder.One of the prior art methods employed to scramble and
descramble a video signal is disclosed in Europe Patent 
Application No. 0 356 200, in which the video signal in analog
form is digitized into separate data packets for separate
video lines. The data packets are sequentially inputted to a
memory and the sequence read out from the memory is randomly
intermixed.U.S. Patent No. 5,192,609 issued to Heun H. Mun offers a
circuit for scrambling a digital TV signal. The scrambling
circuit comprises a memory and a pseudo-random address
generator for generating a pseudo-random address and a
sequential address. The digital TV signal is written on the
memory in accordance with the pseudo-random address and read
out from the memory in accordance with the sequential address
in order to form a scrambled TV signal, which is incorporated
herein by reference.Further prior art scrambling devices are disclosed
in US-A-4 636 852 and US-A-4 605 961.While the above and other prior art scrambling devices
may be capable of performing their assigned task, they
necessarily require a memory for use to change the sequence of
the digital video signal. Therefore, needs have continued to
exist for an improved video signal scrambling device which is
more advantageous and desirable in terms of memory
requirements and manufacturing costs.It is, therefore, an object of the invention to provide
an apparatus for scrambling and descrambling a video signal 
without requiring a memory device to store digital video
signals to be scrambled.It is another object of the invention to provide

horizontal and a vertical blanking detection signal;
means (10) for converting the composite video signal
into a number of video data samples, wherein each of the video

data samples has one of a group of distinct quantities within
a predetermined range;
scrambling data generator (30), in response to the
horizontal and the vertical blanking detection signals, for

generating a number of scrambling data corresponding to the
number of video data samples;
