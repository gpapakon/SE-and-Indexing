<ABSTRACT>
A chair lift with fixed attachments is equipped at the departure station with a conveyor belt 16 which brings the skiers to the loading point 15 where they are taken up, while walking, by a chair 11, which picks them up. The engagement of the skiers on the conveyor belt 16 is controlled by the passage of the chair, which will take up these skiers, in front of a detector 22. Access to the conveyor belt 16 is controlled by a gate 20, managed by the detector 22, fastened to the entry pilon (pole, support) of the station.
