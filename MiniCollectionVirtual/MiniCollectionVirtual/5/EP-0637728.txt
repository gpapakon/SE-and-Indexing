<ABSTRACT>
A system for ventilation of the crew compartment of a fighting vehicle (combat vehicle) having an engine bay (5), which is separate from the crew compartment (2) and in which a cooler (9) having a sucking cooling fan (10) is located, consists of an air suction and cleaning device (12, 13, 15) having a ventilator (fan) (14) and of an air distribution channel (16) having outlet openings (17) in the crew compartment. In order to create a ventilation system which avoids the said defects and complies with all the requirements with little technical complexity, a through-opening (20), which can be closed, is provided between the crew compartment (2) and the engine bay (5).

the crew-compartment (2), wherein a cooler (9) and a suction
fan (10) are lodged, 
caracterized
 in that the system consists
of:


a) an air intake and cleaning device (12,13,15) aspirating
ambient air comprizing a ventilator (14), an air distribution

duct (16) and discharge nozzles (17) in the crew-compartment,
and
b) a passage (20) between the crew-compartment (2) and the
engine compartment (5) closable depending on the pressure

in the engine-compartment.
Ventilation system according to claim 1, 
caracterized

in that the ventilator (14) is an axial flow ventilator.
Ventilation system according to claim 1, 
caracterized

in that the passage (20) is followed by a silencer (23).
Ventilation system according to claim 1, 
caracterized
