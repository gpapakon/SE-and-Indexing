<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel 2',3'-dideoxy-3'-fluoro-purine
nucleoside compounds, physiologically functional derivatives thereof,
processes for their preparation, pharmaceutical formulations
containing them and the use of such analogues and derivative compounds
in therapy, particularly the treatment or prophylaxis of viral
infections.One group of viruses which has assumed a particular importance is the
retroviruses. Retroviruses form a sub-group of RNA viruses which, in
order to replicate, must first 'reverse transcribe' the RNA of their
genome into DNA ('transcription' conventionally describes the
synthesis of RNA from DNA). Once in the form of DNA, the viral genome
may be incorporated into the host cell genome, allowing it to take
advantage of the host cell's transcription/translation machinery for
the purposes of replication. Once incorporated, the viral DNA is
virtually indistinguishable from the host's DNA and, in this state,
the virus may persist for the life of the cell.A species of retrovirus, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), has been
reproducibly isolated from humans with Acquired Immune Deficiency
Syndrome (AIDS) or with the symptoms that frequently precede AIDS.
AIDS is an immunosuppressive or immunodestructive disease that
predisposes subjects to fatal opportunistic infections. Characteristically,
AIDS is associated with a progressive depletion of T-cells,
especially the helper-inducer subset bearing the OKT4 surface marker.
HIV is cytopathic and appears to preferentially infect and destroy
T-cells bearing the OKT4 marker and it is now generally recognised
that HIV is the etiological agent of AIDS.Since the discovery that HIV is the etiological agent of AIDS,
numerous proposals have been made for anti-HIV chemotherapeutic agents
that may be effective in treating AIDS. Thus, for example, European
Patent Specification No. 196185 describes 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine 
(which has the approved name zidovudine), its pharmaceutically
acceptable derivatives and their use in the treatment of human
retrovirus infections including AIDS and associated clinical
conditions. Other nucleoside derivatives which have been suggested
for the treatment of HIV infections include the 3'-fluoronucleosides
described in European Patent No. 0 254 268. European Patent
Specification No. 0 317 128 discloses certain 3'-fluoro-purine and
pyrimidine nucleoside analogues having anti-HIV activity.Another group of viral pathogens of major consequence worldwide are
the hepatitis viruses, in particular hepatitis B
