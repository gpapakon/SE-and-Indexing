<ABSTRACT>
In an exhaust gas manifold and heat exchanger unit 
(2) for mounting on an internal combustion engine (1), 

the outlet (13) of the manifold (3) may be closed off 
from the inlet of the exchanger (4) to allow in situ 

cleaning of the exchanger (4). The manifold (3) may be 
removably attached to the exchanger (4) to allow them to 

be moved apart at their interface to allow the insertion 
of a blanking plate (19) (see Fig. 2) between the 

manifold outlet (13) and the exchanger inlet.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to heat exchangers 
for internal combustion engines, and particularly, but 
not exclusively, to heat exchangers for diesel engines. In hazardous situations, such as underground or on 
oil rigs, the use of internal combustion engines is 
strictly regulated, and they must operate to various 
standards, for example British Standards and the 
prevailing codes of practice. These standards set 
maximum limits on exhaust gas temperatures in dependence 
on the environment in which the engines are operated and 
on the gases present. Accordingly, the exhaust gases 
are typically cooled by being passed through a water-cooled 
exhaust gas heat exchanger before being vented to 
atmosphere. This may reduce the exhaust gas temperature 
of a diesel engine, for example, from 600°C to 200°C or 
less. To add such a heat exchanger to an engine, it is 
standard practice to bolt an integral exhaust gas 
manifold/heat exchanger unit directly onto the engine in 
place of the engine's normal exhaust manifold, and to 
link the unit's cooling system with that of the engine, 
whilst upgrading the engine radiator to cope with the 
added demand. The unit may comprise an exchanger of any standard 
design and be water jacketed. It may have additional 
attachments, such as a flame arrestor on its gas outlet. A problem with these units is the complex procedure 
involved in cleaning those portions of the exchanger 
through which the exhaust gases pass, to remove, for 
example, carbon deposits. To clean such a unit, the cooling systems of both 
the engine and unit must be drained, and most of the 
unit's cooling pipes disconnected. Lifting equipment  
 
must be brought in to take the weight of the unit, which 
may be as much as 300 kg, the unit must be unbolted from 
the engine, and any other supports or brackets holding 
it in place must be removed. The unit must then be 
taken away to a suitable cleaning site. After blanking 
all ports, the unit is then filled with a cleaning fluid 
through its gas outlet, and left to stand and soak for a 
set time before being flushed out. Often, it is necessary to send the unit to a 
specialist cleaner, which means having to ship the unit 
ashore in the case of oil rig use, and reverse 
operations must, of course, be carried out to reinstall 
the unit, once cleaned. Thus, cleaning maintenance of such a unit is a 
difficult and time-consuming exercise, requiring a 
number of workers and a long down-time in engine 
operation, which is expensive. Further, these drawbacks 
can

<CLAIMS>
A method of cleaning an exhaust gas heat exchanger 
of an internal combustion engine, comprising the steps 

of closing off the exhaust gas manifold from the exhaust 
gas heat exchanger, and then cleaning the exchanger, 

both steps being carried out whilst the manifold and 
exchanger are mounted on the engine. 
The method of claim 1, wherein the exchanger is 
closed off from the exhaust manifold and filled with 

cleaning fluid through its exhaust gas outlet. 
The method of claim 2, wherein the exhaust gas 
outlet is closed off after the exchanger has been filled 

with cleaning fluid, and the cleaning fluid is then 
circulated through the exchanger via a fluid inlet and a 

fluid outlet of the exchanger. 
The method of claim 1, wherein the manifold is 
closed off from the exchanger, and an inspection plate 

in the exchanger is opened to allow access to the inside 
of the exchanger. 
The method of any preceding claim, wherein the 
manifold is closed off from the exchanger by placing a 

blanking plate between an outlet of the manifold and an 
inlet of the exchanger. 
An exhaust gas manifold and heat exchanger unit 
adapted to be mounted on an internal combustion engine, 

wherein means are provided for enabling the exhaust 
manifold and heat exchanger portions of the unit to be 

closed off from one another whilst the unit is mounted 
on the engine. 
An exhaust manifold and heat exchanger unit adapted 
to be mounted on an internal combustion engine, and 

 
suitable for in situ cleaning of the exchanger, in which 

the manifold and exchanger are movable apart from one 
another at their interface. 
The unit of claim 6 or 7, wherein the manifold has 
a single gas outlet which communicates with a single 

heat exchanger gas inlet. 
The unit of any of claims 6 to 8, wherein the unit 
is adapted to allow the insertion of a blanking plate to 

close off the exchanger from the manifold. 
The unit of any of claims 6 to 9, wherein the 
exchanger is provided with an outlet for removing 

cleaning fluid from the exchanger. 
The unit of claim 10, wherein the exchanger is 
provided with an inlet for feeding cleaning fluid into 

the exchanger. 
The unit of claim 11, wherein the cleaning fluid 
inlet is provided with a gauge for measuring pressure in 

exhaust gas sections of the exchanger during normal use. 
The unit of any of claims 6 to 12, wherein the 
exchanger is provided with an inspection plate. 
The unit of claim 13, wherein the inspection plate 
is mounted at the end of the exchanger nearest the 

exhaust gas outlet, and wherein the exchanger is a 
single pass exchanger. 
The unit of claim 13 or 14, wherein the inspection 
plate is water-jacketed. 
An internal combustion engine/heat exchanger system 
incorporating a manifold/heat exchanger unit as claimed
