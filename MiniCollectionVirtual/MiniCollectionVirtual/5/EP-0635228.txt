<ABSTRACT>
A chair, particularly office chair, has as so-called sychronizing mechanism a front seat carrier part (6), fixed in relation to a chair column, and a rear seat carrier part (7) which is pivotable with respect to said front seat carrier part about a pivot shaft (8) and carries a backrest. A seat is supported on the two seat carrier parts (6, 7). Articulated on the rear seat carrier part (7) at a distance from the pivot shaft (8) is a locking lever (62) of a locking device (61), which locking lever has a stop face (64). The latter comes into engagement under gravity with a locking face (65) fixed relative to the front seat carrier part (6). To release this locking arrangement, the locking lever (62) is lifted by means of an actuating arm (67) of the locking arrangement.

<CLAIMS>
A chair, in particular an office chair, comprising 

a pedestal (2) 
a chair column (4) projecting upwards from the pedestal (2) 
a seat support (5) supported on the chair column (4) and having a 
front seat support member (6) joined to the chair column (4) and a 

rear seat support member (7) joined to the front seat support member 
(6) by way of a pivot axle (8) 
a seat (10) pivotably supported on the seat support members (6, 7) 
a back-rest (15) secured to the rear seat support member (7) 
an energy storing device (48), of which one end is positioned on the 
front seat support member (6) by means of a pivot hinge (59) and of 

which the other end is pivotably supported on the rear seat support 
member (7) at a distance (a) from the pivot axle (8), and 
a blocking mechanism (61) for arresting the rear seat support member 
(7) in relation to the front seat support member (6), 
characterized in that
 
the blocking mechanism (61) has a blocking lever (62) articulated on the 

rear seat support member (7) at a distance from the pivot axle (8) by 
means of a pivot joint (63) and provided with a stop face (64) which is 

pivotable into bearing engagement with a blocking face (65) stationary 
referred to the front seat support member (6) and releasable from this 

bearing engagement by means of a blocking actuator arm (67). 
A chair according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the stop face (64) 
is turned away from the pivot joint (63) and that the blocking face (65) 

faces the latter. 
A chair according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the blocking 
lever (62) is pivotable upwards out of the bearing engagement of the stop 

face (64) with the blocking face (65). 
A chair according to one of the claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 
the blocking actuator arm (67) engages from below an end of the blocking  

 
lever (62) turned away from the pivot joint (63) to release the bearing 

engagement of the stop face (64) with the blocking face (65). 
A chair according to one of the claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that
 
the blocking actuator arm (67) is arranged on an actuating shaft (28) 

which is pivotably arranged in a suspension tube (9) supporting the seat 
(10) in the vicinity of front edge (11) of the seat (10). 
A chair according to one of the claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that
 
the blocking actuator arm (67) is T-shaped with a transverse web (67a) 

engaging the blocking lever (62) from below. 
A chair according to claim 6, 
characterized in that
 the blocking lever 
(62) has a forked end (66) which faces the blocking actuator arm (67) 

and with which the blocking actuator arm (67) engages.
