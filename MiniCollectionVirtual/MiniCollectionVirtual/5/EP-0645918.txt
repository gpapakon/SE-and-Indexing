<ABSTRACT>
Two alternative solutions are provided for the transmission of message cells via virtual path pairs in each case formed from an active path (AP) and an alternative path (EP). In a first solution, the message cells transmitted via the active path and the alternative path of a path pair are fed to the output of the coupling device (CCb) located at the end of the path pair concerned. From here, the message cells of the active path or the alternative path are forwarded according to the number of message cells arriving via the active path and the alternative path. In the second solution, the message cells of the alternative path are initially rejected at the input of the coupling device concerned. However, in the event of an interruption in the active path, this being indicated to the coupling device by an interruption signal, the message cells arriving via the alternative path are forwarded by the coupling device.
