<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to certain novel
bis-phosphine ligand compounds, to novel hydroformylation
catalyst systems containing the phosphine ligands
and the use of the catalyst system in the hydroformylation
of various α-olefins to produce aldehydes. The
catalyst system produces aldehydes having a high ratio
of normal (straight-chain) to iso (branched-chain)
aldehydes in good to excellent rates.The hydroformylation reaction is useful in the
preparation of aldehyde products by the reaction of one
mole of olefin with one mole each of hydrogen and carbon
monoxide. The reaction is especially useful in the
preparation of normal and iso-butyraldehyde from
propylene. These materials in turn are converted into
many chemical products such as n-butanol, 2-ethylhexanol,
n-butyric acid, iso-butanol, neopentyl glycol
and the like. The hydroformylation of higher α-olefins
such as 1-octene, 1-hexene and 1-decene yield aldehyde
products which are useful feedstocks for the preparation
of detergent alcohols. It is known that linear (normal)
carbon-chain alcohol products are particularly desirable
for use in detergent grade products. According to U.S.
Patent 4,215,077, allyl alcohol is hydroformylated to
produce an intermediate which may be converted to
1,4-butanediol. Again, in this use of the hydroformylation
reaction it is desirable to obtain aldehyde
products where the formyl group is added to the terminal
position of the olefin thus obtaining linear carbon-chain
aldehyde products.The original hydroformylation catalyst systems were
based on cobalt carbonyl catalysts and required high
operating reactor pressures and temperatures in order to 
obtain practical aldehyde production rates. See, for
example, J. Falbe, Carbon Monoxide in Organic Synthesis,
pp. 3-75, Springer-Verlag, Berlin 1970. A consequence
of these required operating conditions was the sacrifice
of much olefin feedstock to alkane formation and the
conversion of some of the desired aldehyde products to a
complex mixture of high-boiling aldol condensation
products. Such by-product formation represents a severe
monetary loss in terms of wasted olefin feedstock and
the expense of processing the high-boiling by-products
to partially convert them into useful products and/or
the environmental costs associated with their disposal.
Additionally, the cobalt carbonyl catalyst systems are
not particularly selective for preparing linear aldehyde
products. For example, in the hydroformylation of
propylene, the practical normal to branched product
ratio varies from about
