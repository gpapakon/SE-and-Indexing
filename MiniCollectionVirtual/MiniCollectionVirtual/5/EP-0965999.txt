<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to compositions useful in the preparation of
cable insulation, semiconducting shields, and jackets.A typical electric power cable generally comprises one or more
conductors in a cable core that is surrounded by several layers of
polymeric materials including a first semiconducting shield layer
(conductor or strand shield), an insulating layer, a second
semiconducting shield layer (insulation shield), a metallic tape or wire
shield, and a protective jacket. Additional layers within this
construction such as moisture impervious materials are often
incorporated. Other cable constructions such as plenum and riser cable
omit the shield.In many cases, crosslinking of the polymeric materials is essential to
the particular cable application, and, in order to accomplish this, useful
compositions generally include a polymer; a crosslinking agent, usually
an organic peroxide; and antioxidants, and, optionally, various other
additives such as a scorch inhibitor or retardant and a crosslinking
booster. Crosslinking assists the polymer in meeting mechanical and
physical requirements such as improved thermal aging and lower
deformation under pressure.The crosslinking of polymers with free radical initiators such as
organic peroxides is well known. Generally, the organic peroxide is 
incorporated into the polymer by melt blending in a roll mill, a biaxial
screw kneading extruder, or a Banbury™ or Brabender™ mixer at a
temperature lower than the onset temperature for significant
decomposition of the peroxide. Peroxides are judged for decomposition
based on their half life temperatures as described in Plastic Additives
Handbook, Gachter et al, 1985, pages 646 to 649. An alternative
method for organic peroxide incorporation into a polymeric compound
is to mix liquid peroxide and pellets of the polymer in a blending
device, such as a Henschel™ mixer or a soaking device such as a simple
drum tumbler, which are maintained at temperatures above the freeze
point of the organic peroxide and below the decomposition temperature
of the organic peroxide and the melt temperature of the polymer.
Following the organic peroxide incorporation, the polymer/organic
peroxide blend is then, for example, introduced into an extruder where
it is extruded around an electrical conductor at a temperature lower
than the decomposition temperature of the organic peroxide to form a
cable. The cable is then exposed to higher temperatures at which the
organic peroxide decomposes to provide free radicals, which crosslink
