<ABSTRACT>
Control of fabric softener viscosity by increasing 
the amount of fragrance in the formulation and to thereby 

influence the amount of fragrance that can be added to the 
fabric softening formulations. A mixture of a perfume or 

fragrance chemical and special group of surface active agents 
is prepared. Thereafter the mixture is added to a fabric 

softener base formulation to produce the fabric softener 
consumer product.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
controlling the viscosity of fabric softening compositions and, 
more particularly, to a method for avoiding gelation or gel 
formation of fabric softener compositions. Fabric softening agents are used in order to improve 
the feel and texture of fabrics and to improve the 
comfortability of fabrics in actual wear. Typically, fabric 
softening agents are applied from an aqueous liquid which is 
made up by adding a relatively small amount of a fabric 
softening composition to a large amount of water, for example 
during the rinse cycle in an automatic washing machine. The 
fabric softening composition is usually an aqueous liquid 
product containing less than about 8% of a cationic fabric 
softening agent which is a quaternary ammonium salt. Such 
compositions are normally prepared by dispersing in water a 
cationic material, for example quaternary ammonium compounds 
which in addition to long chain alkyl groups may also contain 
ester or amide groups. It is also advantageous to use mixtures 
of different fabric softening components which are typically 
added to the last wash cycle rinse both in the form of aqueous 
dispersions. It is widely known that fragrances can be introduced  
 
into liquid fabric softener compositions in order to cause the 
treated fabrics to have aromas with good initial strength. 
Efforts have also been made to develop systems in which aromas 
are controllably released during the normal conditions of use 
of the fabrics treated with solutions created from the liquid 
softening compositions of matter at a predictable sufficiently 
high level over an extended period time. It is recognized in the prior art that perfume 
containing particles of a defined melting point and size can be 
incorporated into compositions containing fabric softening 
components. Typical of such prior art is Canadian Patent 
1,111,616, German OLS 2631129, German OLS 2702162, U.S. Patents 
4,234,627 and 4,464,271. However it has been found that when the amount of 
fragrance is increased beyond just one, two or three percent, 
there is a tendency for the fabric softener base formulation to 
gel. Undesirable gelation of the fabric softener reduces the 
shelf life of the product and may cause an adverse consumer 
reaction when the person using the fabric softener opens the 
container and finds that the fabric softener has formed a gel 
like, highly viscous mass instead of being free flowing. This tendency of gel formation has prevented the 
utilization of larger

<CLAIMS>
A method for controlling the viscosity of fabric 
softener compositions to thereby improve shelf life comprising: 

   forming a mixture of a perfume and a surfactant by 
mixing a perfume and a surfactant at a temperature where each 

component is in the liquid state, wherein said surfactant is an 
ethoxylated fatty alcohol, 

   mixing together said mixture and a fabric softener 
base formulation in sufficient amounts to thereby form a fabric 

softener composition which avoids gelation. 
The method according to claim 1 wherein said 
surfactant is polyoxyethylated ether of cholesterol and cetyl 

alcohol. 
The method according to claim 1 wherein the 
surfactant has a high HLB number. 
The method according to claim 1 wherein the 
surfactant is used in a proportion of 0.1 to 3 parts per part 

of perfume. 
The method according to claim 1 wherein mixing of 
the perfume and surfactant takes place under conditions which 

prevent air entrainment. 
The method according to claim 2 wherein the 
surfactant is used in a proportion of 0.1 to 3 parts per part 

of perfume. 
A surfactant for use in the method of any one of 
Claims 1 to 6. 
A fabric softener composition which comprises a 
mixture of a perfume and a surfactant at a temperature, in 

use, where each component is in the liquid state, the 
surfactant being an ethoxylated fatty alcohol, and a fabric 

softener base formulation in a sufficient amount to avoid 
gelation of the fabric softener composition.
