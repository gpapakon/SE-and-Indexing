<ABSTRACT>
Improved fluid loss control in gravel pack placement fluids is achieved 
when a fluid loss control additive is provided comprising a selectively soluble 

particulate having a size of less than 1000 microns and having a linear size 
distribution when cumulative weight percent is plotted against the logarithm of 

the particle size. The preferred selectively soluble particulate comprises 
calcium carbonate

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the art of recovery of hydrocarbon values from
subterranean formations and, more particularly, to a fluid loss control additive
and method for its use in avoiding fluid loss during the placement of a gravel
pack in an unconsolidated formation. A gravel placement fluid and a method according to the preamble of independent claims 1, 6 are known from US-A-3 675 717.In the art of well completions, subterranean formations holding
hydrocarbon values such as oil and/or natural gas can comprise
unconsolidated fine particulate materials. When a well penetrating such a
formation is placed on production in order to recover the hydrocarbons
therefrom, the fine particulate matter in the formation is carried into the well bore
and can eventually block the production of hydrocarbons with silt.In the production of hydrocarbons from such unconsolidated formations,
it has been common to place a so-called gravel pack in the near well bore area.
The gravel pack comprises a sized particulate, typically sand, which forms a
filter bed which traps formation particulates in the interstices between the sand
particles while allowing the flow of fluid hydrocarbon components to proceed to
the well bore. In this manner, production of the hydrocarbon fluids can proceed
for an extended period of time without a buildup of silt within the well which
would otherwise inhibit or completely terminate production.A gravel pack is typically placed in the near well bore area utilizing a well
packer to isolate the desired formation and pumping the sand in a viscosified 
fluid through a screen or slotted liner to place the gravel pack sand in and
adjacent to the well bore at the unconsolidated formation face. The placement
fluid typically is viscosified by any of several natural and/or synthetic polymeric
materials such as cellulosics, galactomannan gums or various synthetic
polymers such as polyacrylamide. In high permeability formations however,
viscous fluids alone can be inadequate to control fluid loss into the highly
permeable surrounding zone. Particulate supplements are often necessary to
decrease such fluid loss to the formation. Conventional particulate based fluid
loss control systems are only moderately successful due to unknown downhole
parameters such as permeability, pore throat size and particle size of the fluid
loss control material. Additionally, clean up and removal of these materials
following gravel pack placement is often difficult.Particulate fluid loss control systems have the ability to
