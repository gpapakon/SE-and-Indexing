The application relates to 
a leader stocker for storing leaders (L) with films (F) 

coupled thereto, said leader stocker (A) comprising a case, a 
plurality of pairs of leader supports provided in said case 

at each side thereof and spaced apart from one another by a 
predetermined interval, each pair of said leader supports 

adapted to support the leader at both sides thereof, and 
detent means (X) provided for each of said leader supports (7) for 

allowing the leader to move along said leader support

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a leader storage unit for storing leaders with films coupled thereto and
to a leader storage assembly arranged to be mounted at a film outlet at an end of the carrier
path of an automatic film developing machine, said leader storage assembly comprising the
above mentioned leader storage unit.Ordinarily, when a film is developed by an automatic film developing machine, a thin and
flat leader having holes is connected to two films in order to guide the films to the
developing unit, as for example known from EP-A-0158 806 or EP-A-0251 338.In the automatic film developing machine, a stock unit is provided at a film outlet and developed
and dried negative films are fed from the film outlet to the stock unit and then piled.In the conventional arrangement, the leaders with films were piled one upon another in a
very disorderly manner. Thus, the films were liable to have a fold or get damaged when
taken out of the stock unit.It is an object of the present invention to provide a leader storage unit and a leader storage assembly
in which developed films having leaders can be piled and stored in order.According to the present invention, this object is solved for a leader storage unit as indicated
above, in that said leader storage unit comprises a rectangular case with its bottom end open, a
plurality of pairs of leader supports, each pair being adapted to support a leader by its lateral
edges, the leader supports consisting of a plurality of grooves spaced apart a predetermined
interval and provided at respective inner sides of two opposite walls of the case,
and detent meand provided for each of said leader supports for allowing a leader to move
along any pair of leader supports forwardly into said leader storage unit and for preventing said
leader from moving in the opposite direction. Further, there is provided a leader storage assembly as indicated above comprising a
storage unit holder for removably holding said leader storage unit, so that one of said pairs of leader
supports opposes said film outlet, leader feeding means for feeding a leader from said film
outlet into the leader storage unit along said pair of leader supports opposing said film outlet
until the leader has passed through said detent means, and transfer means for moving the
storage unit holder in a direction perpendicular to the direction of feeding the leaders to a position
where the next pair of leader supports opposes said film outlet every time a leader has
passed said detent means.The leader storage unit is

<CLAIMS>
A leader storage unit (A) for storing leaders (L) with films (F) coupled thereto,

characterised in that
 said leader storage unit (A) comprises a rectangular case (1) with
its bottom end open, a plurality of pairs of leader supports (7), each pair being

adapted to support a leader (L) by its lateral edges, the leader supports (7)
consisting of a plurality of grooves spaced apart a predetermined interval and

provided at respective inner sides of two opposite walls of the case (1), and
detent means (X) provided for each of said leader supports (7) for allowing a

leader (L) to move along any pair of leader supports (7) forwardly into said leader
storage unit (A) and for preventing said leader (L) from moving in the opposite

direction.
A leader storage unit according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 said detent means
(X) comprising a claw (9) mounted in a recess (8) provided at the bottom end of

the leader support (7), the rear end of said claw (9) being pivotably supported by
a pin (10) such that said claw (9) being pivotable in a plane common with said

inserted leader (L).
A leader storage unit according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 said detent means
(X) comprising a pair of roller housing recesses (60) provided at the bottom side

of said leader support (7), each recess (60) accommodating a one-way roller (61)
to allow a movement of said leader (L) only in one direction.
A leader storage unit according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 said detent means
(X) comprising a pin hole (62) at the bottom of each inner side of said opposite

walls, each pin hole (62) accommodating a detent pin (63), a spring (64) for
biasing said detent pin (63) to the interior of said case (1), said detent pin 63 

having a tapered surface (65) at its end facing the interior of said case (1) to allow
a movement of said leader (L) only in one direction.
A leader storage unit according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 said detent means
(X) comprising recesses (66) provided at one side of the lower part of each leader

support (7) to accommodate a claw (67), the rear end of which being pivotably
supported by a pin (68) such that said claw (67) being pivotable in a plane

traverse to the plane of the inserted leader (L).
