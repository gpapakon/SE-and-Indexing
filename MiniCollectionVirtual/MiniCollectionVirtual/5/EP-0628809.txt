<ABSTRACT>
A calibration standard comprises a supporting structure (1) 
of single crystal material with at least one pair of different 

kinds of structures consisting of a raised line (2) 
and a trench (3). These structures have the identical width 

in the range of about 500 nm. The single crystal material 
preferably is silicon with (110)-orientation. A method of 

producing the calibration standard comprises the steps: 
providing two polished wafers of the same single crystal 

material and with the same crystal orientation, forming an 
oxide layer on the polished surface of the first wafer, 

bonding the second wafer to the first oxidized wafer with 
the polished surfaces of the wafers facing each other, 

cutting the bonded structure rectangular to the polished 
surfaces, selectively etching both the wafers to a defined 

depth, masking the portions of the oxide layer now representing 
the raised line (2) and selectively etching the 

oxide layer in the unmasked areas to a defined depth to 
form the trench (3). 
The calibration standard may be used for the profilometry 
in the sub-nanometer range.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a calibration standard for 
the profilometry in the sub-nanometre range, especially for 
the AFM/STM profilometry and to a method of producing said 
calibration standard. Nanometrology stands for the measurement technology necessary 
to investigate, to develop and to verify the measuring 
features of instruments and of material standards with an 
uncertainty best given in units of nanometers. For the 
calibration of different probe systems and different measuring 
instruments reference standards are asked for. 2-D AFM profilometry uses specially shaped ultrafine 
silicon tips with a diameter of typically about 250 nm. The 
absolute measuring preciseness solely depends on the exact 
knowledge of the tip diameter which usually is determined 
by a high resolution SEM with a measuring accuracy of 3 to 
5%. With a tip diameter of 250 nm this leads to a measuring 
preciseness worse than about 7.5 nm. Within the electron 
microscope, depending on the rest gas concentration, the 
tip is more or less contaminated and thus its diameter is 
changed undefinitely during measuring. To improve the 
measuring accuracy the tip should be calibrated directly 
before and after the measurement with a gauge. Other common solutions also focus on the application of 
single-crystal silicon technology. A standard reference material (SRM) consisting of a silicon 
wafer with a silicon dioxide film of uniform thickness is 
described in SPIE Vol.661, "Film thickness and refractive  
 
index Standard Reference Material calibrated by 
ellipsometry and profilometry" by G.A.Candela et.al.. The 
silicon dioxide film contains windows used for stylus 
profilometry measurements with a mechanical depth very 
nearly the same as the oxide thickness. The depth is not 
exactly the same as the oxide thickness due to native oxide 
forming in the window with an average thickness of about 
2nm. This affects the accuracy of the measurement. In Metrologia, 1991/92, Vol.28, pp.443-453, "Nanometrology 
at the PTB" by H.Kunzmann, a reference scale in the sub-nanometre 
range is derived from a silicon single crystal 
epitaxially grown by chemical gas transfer. With high 
probability the surface of this crystal is plane within one 
lattice plane and it is proposed to use the steps which are 
small-integer multiples of lattice plane distances for the 
calibration of probe systems for nanometrology. These steps 
are results of the epitaxial processes and they could be 
used to manufacture step-height gauges, but only if the
