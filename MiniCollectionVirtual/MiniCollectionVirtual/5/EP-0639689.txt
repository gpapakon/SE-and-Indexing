<ABSTRACT>
A cementing tool for cementing multiple stages 
within a well includes a housing assembly (12) which defines 

one or more cementing ports (22). A first sleeve assembly 
(38) is retained within the housing (12) and is movable from 

a first position (Fig. 1), where the sleeve (38) covers the 
port (22), and thereby precludes fluid flow therethrough, to 

a second position (Fig. 3) wherein the sleeve opens the 
cementing port (22). A second sleeve assembly (39) is 

movable from a first position (Fig. 1) away from the 
cementing port (22) to a second position (Fig. 4) wherein 

the sleeve assembly covers the port (22). The first sleeve 
(38) is cooperatively configured with the housing assembly 

(12) to provide engaging surfaces which resist rotation of 
the first sleeve relative to the housing. Additionally, the 

first sleeve (38) and the second sleeve assembly (39) are 
configured to limit relative rotation when the two pieces 

are longitudinally adjacent one another.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to 
apparatus for cementing a well and, more specifically, to 
apparatus for multiple stage cementing particularly useful 
in cementing operations performed within an existing casing 
string, otherwise known as "secondary cementing" 
operations. Secondary cementing procedures are utilized in 
wells during their productive lives, such as remedial 
cementing and repairs to existing cemented areas. This may 
be necessitated by a number of occurrences. For example, 
the inside surface of an existing casing string will often 
corrode or otherwise deteriorate over time, thereby 
decreasing fluid flow through the string. In addition, the 
corrosion may cause the casing string to become fluid 
permeable, thereby leading to fluid leakage. At such time, 
secondary cementing may be utilized to repair the 
deteriorated section of casing. In such operations, when 
the well cannot be cemented from the bottom of the casing, 
it is often preferable to cement the annulus in two or more 
stages. For example, two stage cementing may be 
necessitated when the formation will not support a column of 
cement slurry over the vertical zone to be cemented. Conventional multi-stage cementing tools have 
suffered from the deficiencies of either being too large in 
diameter to be satisfactorily utilized in workover 
operations, or of having components which are relatively  
 
difficult to drill out to provide an optimally open bore 
through the casing once the operation is completed. We have now devised a multi-stage cementing tool 
which can be figured to provide an optimally minimized outer 
diameter, and which can have internal components adapted to 
facilitate drilling out of the components facilitating the 
establishing of a full open bore after the cementing 
operation is completed. According to the present invention, there is 
provided an apparatus for cementing multiple stages within a 
well, which apparatus comprises a housing assembly, said 
housing assembly having at least one port therein; a first 
sleeve retained within said housing, said sleeve being 
movable from a first position covering said port to a second 
position opening said port; a second sleeve assembly, said 
sleeve assembly being movable from a first position away 
from said port to a second position covering said port; 
said housing assembly further comprising an inwardly 
extending tapered shoulder, and said first sleeve comprising 
a tapered surface, said tapered shoulder and said tapered 
surface being

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus (10) for cementing multiple stages 
within a well, which apparatus comprises a housing assembly 

(12), said housing assembly having at least one port (22) 
therein; a first sleeve (38) retained within said housing 

(12), said sleeve (38) being movable from a first position 
covering said port (22) to a second position opening said 

port (22); a second sleeve assembly (39), said sleeve 
assembly (39) being movable from a first position away from 

said port (22) to a second position covering said port (22); 
said housing assembly (12) further comprising an inwardly 

extending tapered shoulder (36), and said first sleeve 
(38) comprising a tapered surface (62), said tapered 

shoulder (36) and said tapered surface (62) being 
cooperatively engageable such that engagement of said 

tapered surface (62) with said tapered shoulder (36) 
establishes said second position of said first sleeve (38) 

and such that said engagement of said tapered surface (62) 
with said tapered shoulder (36) inhibits relation of said 

first sleeve (38) relative to said housing assembly (12). 
Apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the angle 
of taper of said tapered shoulder (36) of said housing 

assembly (12) is different from the angle of taper of said 
tapered surface (62) of said first sleeve (38). 
Apparatus according to claim 1 or 2, wherein said 
first sleeve (38) and said second sleeve assembly (39) are 

configured to be cooperatively engageable to establish a 
limited range of rotation between said first sleeve (38) and 

at least a portion of said second sleeve assembly (39) when 
said first sleeve (38) is in said second position, and 

wherein said portion of said second sleeve assembly(39) is 
further in said second position. 
Apparatus according to claim 1,2 or 3, wherein 
said second sleeve assembly (39) comprises a sealing sleeve 

(40) and an actuation sleeve (42), said actuation sleeve 
(42) being releasably coupled to said sealing sleeve (40). 
Apparatus according to claim 4, wherein said 
actuation sleeve (42) is cooperatively configured with said
