<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a method of modifying the taste of food, medicines and cosmetics, especially, a 
protein-lipid complex having an effect in reducing the bitter taste of these products, and a method of modifying the 

taste of food, medicines and cosmetics using the same complex, and more particularly to a bitter taste reducing method.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a flavour-modifying
agent which removes or masks unpleasant
tastes such as bitterness in a substance which is to
be orally ingested, such as a foodstuff or a
pharmaceutical, by imparting a pleasant flavour to
the substance when the agent is added to it, and to
a method of modifying the taste of a foodstuff or of a
pharmaceutical product with the flavour-modifying
agent.Further, the present invention relates to a
bitterness-decreasing or masking agent which can
decrease an unpleasant bitter taste in a foodstuff,
a pharmaceutical product or a cosmetic by
adding the agent thereto, and a method for
decreasing bitterness by means of the bitterness-decreasing
agent.Bitter-tasting substances are generally
repellent substances and are often substances which
a healthy person should not ingest. A human being
has a biophylactic mechanism for sensing and
rejecting bitter substances in his mouth, and a
bitter-tasting substance can be sensed even if it is
present only in an extremely small amount as
compared with other substances such as sweet-, 
salty- and sour-tasting substances.However, bitter-tasting substances are present
in nearly all edible natural substances and human
beings have learned that they are safe by
experience. Further, human beings enjoy the
bitterness of many foods for example,
luxury items such as coffee, tobacco and tea or
fermented foodstuffs such as beer and cheese. Thus,
although bitterness is an important factor in the
satisfaction obtained from food, the existence
thereof can cause a foodstuff, a pharmaceutical
product or a cosmetic to be rated low in
quality.The presence of an unpleasant bitter taste is
a serious matter to the food industry. For example,
the bitterness of amino acids or peptides present in
the products of proteolysis and that of a bitter-tasting
substance present in fruit juice lowers the
perceived quality of foodstuffs. Methods of removing
bitter-tasting substances from foods include the use
of adsorbents or clathrate compounds and the
addition of sweetening agents. However, these
methods are unsatisfactory in that the bitterness
cannot be completely eliminated and in that the taste
of the food is altered, for example.Bitterness is also a significant problem in the
pharmaceutical industry. More precisely, nearly all 
of the pharmaceuticals used as medicines have a
bitter taste and decreasing of the bitter taste has
become a significant issue. In particular, the
decreasing of the bitter taste is important in
preparations for babies and

comprising a protein-lipid complex which is an

aggregate of a protein with a lipid.
