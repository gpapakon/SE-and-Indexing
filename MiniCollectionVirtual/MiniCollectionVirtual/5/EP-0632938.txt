<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to multiple resonant oscillator 
circuits A well known differential amplifier comprises a 
matched pair of bipolar transistors, a matched pair of load 
impedances and a current source. Each load impedance is 
connected between a voltage supply and a collector of a 
respective one of the transistors, and emitters of both 
transistors are connected to the current source. A differential 
input is applied to bases of the transistors, and a differential 
output is taken from the collectors of the transistors. Two such differential amplifiers can be cross-coupled 
to construct a quadrature phase Voltage Controlled 
Oscillator (VCO) which oscillates with 90 degree phase shift 
across each differential amplifier and with 180 degree phase 
shift in the cross-coupled feedback loop. Unfortunately, the 
quality factors (Q) of such VCOs are smaller than desired for 
many high frequency applications. Krummenacher discloses the use of cross-coupled 
CMOS transconductance amplifiers in various filter 
configurations ("Design Considerations in High-Frequency 
CMOS Transconductance Amplifier (TAC) Filters". 1989, IEEE 
International Symposium of Circuits and Systems, Vol. 1, pp. 
100-105). Cross-coupled amplifiers having equal gain are 
used to implement single port gyrator resonators, and cross-coupled 
amplifiers having unequal gain are used to 
implement coupling gyrators. The gyrator resonators and 
coupling gyrators are connected together in a variety of  
 
ladder and "Follow the Leader" (FLF) configurations to 
implement desired filter characteristics. Krummenacher uses a negative shunt impedance 
having a precisely controlled transconductance to tune the 
quality factor (Q) of his filter designs. Such precise control of 
transconductance ratios is readily achieved only in MOS 
implementations, and these are effective only for circuits 
operating at frequencies up to about 100 MHz. This invention provides a multiple resonator oscillator circuit, 
comprising a plurality of two port resonators. Each two port 
resonator comprises first and second amplifiers and first and 
second ports. The first amplifier has an input, an output, and 
a first gain and a 90 degree phase shift at a resonant 
frequency of the multiple resonator oscillator circuit. The 
second amplifier has an input coupled to said output of the 
first amplifier and an output cross-coupled to said input of 
the first amplifier. The second amplifier has a second gain 
and a 90 degree phase shift at the resonant frequency of the 
mult
