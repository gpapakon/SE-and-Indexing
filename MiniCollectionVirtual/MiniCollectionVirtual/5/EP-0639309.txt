Asynchronous logic circuit (FAL), 

in which a first output (OP2) of a first logic block 
(PL) is connected via a first field-effect transistor 

(1) of a first conduction type (p) to a supply 
voltage terminal (VDD) and a second output (OP1) of 

the first logic block (PL) is connected via a first 
field-effect transistor (2) of a second conduction 

type (n) to a reference potential terminal (VSS), 
in which a first output (ON1) of a second logic 
block (NL) is connected via a first field-effect 

transistor (3) of a first conduction type (p) to a 
supply voltage terminal (VDD) and a second output 

(ON2) of the second logic block (NL) is connected 
via a first field-effect transistor (4) of a second 

conduction type (n) to a reference potential terminal 
(VSS), 
in which the first logic block (PL) contains only 
field-effect transistors of the first conduction 

type (p) and the second logic block (NL) contains 
only field-effect transistors of the second conduction 

type (n) and both logic blocks together are 
connected to identical input lines (I), 
in which the first and second logic block (PL, NL) 
have a switching behaviour which is complementary to 

one another, the first output (OP2) of the first  
 

logic block (PL) being switched through, as a function 
of control signals of the input lines (I), to 

the second output (OP1) of the first logic block 
(PL) precisely when the first output (ON1) of the 

second logic block (NL) is not switched through to 
the second output (ON2) of the second logic block 

(NL), and vice versa,

transistor (1) of the first conduction type 

(p), of the first field-effect transistor (2) of the 
second conduction type (n), of the second field-effect 

transistor (3) of the first conduction type 
(p) and of the second field-effect transistor (4) of 

the second conduction type (n) is connected to an 
request input (REQ), 
in which a ready-message output (RDY) is connected 
via a third and a fourth field-effect transistor (6, 

7) of the first conduction type (p) to the supply 
voltage terminal (VDD), the gate of the third field-effect 

transistor (6) of the first conduction type 
(p) being connected to the first output (ON1) of the 

second logic block (NL) and the gate of the fourth 
field-effect transistor (7) of the first conduction 

type (p) being connected to the first output (OP2) 
of the first logic block (PL), 
in which the ready-message output (RDY) is connected 
via a third and a fourth field-effect transistor (5, 

8) of the second conduction type (n) to the reference 
potential terminal (VDD), the gate of the third 

field-effect transistor (5) of the second conduction 
type (n) being connected to the second output (OP1) 

of the first logic block (PL) and the gate of the 
fourth field-effect transistor (8) of the second 

conduction type (n) being connected to the second 
output (ON2) of the second logic block (NL), and  

 
in which outputs (OP1, ON1) of the two logic blocks 
simultaneously constitute outputs (OUT1, OUT2) of 

the asynchronous logic circuit (FAL). 
Logic circuit according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the first logic block (NL) is composed of n-channel 

field-effect transistors exclusively and the second logic 
block (PL) is composed of p-channel field-effect transistors 

exclusively.
