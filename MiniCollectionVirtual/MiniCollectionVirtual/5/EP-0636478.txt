<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink jet head according to the
preamble of claim 1, and an ink jet
cartridge and an ink jet recording apparatus comprising such
head.In the conventionally known ink jet head, means
for generating energy is arranged on the liquid paths
for discharging ink, while the ink supplied to a liquid
chamber is induced from an ink tank or the like to the
above-mentioned liquid paths through an ink supply
outlet. Here, the energy is generated and given to the
ink by means for generating energy, thus discharging
the ink from the discharge ports. The discharged ink
droplets impact upon a recording medium to form pixels
for recording. Of such ink jet heads, the one which
utilizes thermal energy for discharging a recording
liquid (ink) is capable of forming a plurality of
discharging ports in a high density. Therefore, in
addition to the capability to record in a high
resolution, a head of the kind has an advantage that
the head can be easily fabricated compactly as a whole.In the conventional ink jet head which utilizes
the thermal energy, a structure is generally arranged
so that such a high density is attained by arranging a 
plurality of heat generating resistive elements on a
substrate made by such as silicon, and also, using a
base board having a common layer of heat accumulation
and an electrically insulated layers.Fig. 11 is a view schematically showing the cross-section
of an ink jet head of such a structure
represented as a background art.In Fig. 11, a reference numeral 1 designates an
alumina substrate; 2a, a heat accumulation layer; 2b
and 2c, electrically insulated layers, respectively; 3,
the heat generating resistive elements; 3a, electrode
wiring to supply electric power to the heat generating
resistive elements 3; and 4, a protective film against
cavitation.On a heater board (hereinafter may be referred to
as laminated circuit base board) 100 structured as
above, a ceiling board 401 grooved to form liquid paths
401 and others is joined together to constitute an ink
jet head.As a result, when the heat generating elements are
energized to execute discharges, the heat thus
generated is not necessarily used for discharging only,
but a part of it is released to the liquid paths
adjacent thereto through the aforesaid base board and
others.With a head of such a structure, the volume of
discharged ink droplet becomes comparatively large 
because the generated heats themselves give influence
to each other when ink is discharged from all the
discharge ports at a time, that is,
