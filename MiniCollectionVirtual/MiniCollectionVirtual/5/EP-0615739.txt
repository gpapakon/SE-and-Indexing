<ABSTRACT>
The bases and caps are aligned in two stages, with 
displacement by first pointed pushers (13-31) into 

corresponding calibrated horizontal channels (12-29) 
followed by displacement by second pushers (21-44) into 

corresponding calibrated vertical and descending channels 
(312-329). The second pusher (21) pushes the bases 

horizontally into the wider terminal part (20) of the 
said descending channel, where the base is sucked by its 

sealed end and inserted into the corresponding supporting 
socket (1), with a vertical disposition and with the 

opening upwards. The second pusher (44), operating with 
the caps, acts on the intermediate parts of these with a 

point (144) which causes the caps to rotate with the 
opening downwards and transfers them with a vertical 

disposition into the wider terminal part (42) of the 
descending channel where the cap is held by a suction 

tube (46) which inserts it into the corresponding 
supporting socket (2). The seats (28) to which the caps 

are fed for orientation are provided at their bases with 
supports (37-137 or 39-139) which ensure that the caps 

are stopped at different levels and that they have the 
best disposition with respect to the first orientating 

pusher.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device
in combination with and for the assembly of the
bases and caps of hard gelatin
capsules in pre-sealed form.
The
device according to the invention can be used
in combination
with hard
gelatin capsules of conventional construction or with
capsules of special construction and/or shape, for example
those of the SCHERER type.From Document DE-A-27 08 147 a device is known for the
filling of empty, pre-closed gelatin capsules. The said
closed capsules are contained in a magazine from which they
are singly picked up and feed into a vertical canal by means
of a first horizontal pusher and a second vertical pusher
and with the aid of baffle means they are oriented so as to
present the cap element directed upwardly and the base
element directed downwardly. The said capsules are
thereafter opened, are filled and are again closed.The device according to the invention is, on the
contrary, intended to solve a problem which is new in the
field of capsules for medicinal use, consisting in the fact
that the caps and bases of the capsules which are initially
separated from each other and are kept loose in two distinct
magazines, since the two enclosing elements of the capsules,
especially in the case of the aforesaid special capsules,
undergo different operations in the process of their
manufacture, such that the said enclosing elements cannot be
advantageously pre-assembled using the conventional methods, 
are picked up from said magazines, are correctly oriented
and are thereafter coupled, so as to form pre-closed empty
caps.The device according to the invention may therefore be
used by the manufacturers of special capsules, to enable
them to supply the capsules in pre-sealed form to those
industries which will carry out the filling of the said
capsules with conventional methods and machines, or may be
used in combination with a machine for filling and sealing
the capsules, in which the bases and caps of the capsules
are fed loose in corresponding magazines. In both the first
and the second case, the device will 
orientate the bases of the capsules with the opening
facing upwards and will insert each base into a
supporting socket, while the caps will be orientated with
the opening downwards and will be inserted into a
corresponding supporting socket. The sockets containing
the caps are located at a higher level than those
containing the bases and are preferably disposed with
their axes vertical. The sockets containing the bases and
the caps are carried by horizontally movable means by
me

Device
in combination with and

for the assembling of the bases and caps of hard
gelatin capsules in pre-sealed form, by picking up said

bases and said caps from two corresponding magazines, and
orienting same with the bases having the opening facing

upwards and the caps with the opening facing downwards,
comprising means (5,25) for picking

up the bases (3) and caps (23) from the magazines and for
cyclically introducing a base and a cap into vertical seats

(10,28), with a vertical disposition and random orientation,
the said seats being formed with a symmetrical disposition

in the intermediate part of horizontal channels (12,29)
whose upline sections (112,129) have a width less than that

of the said seats and in which there are guided and slide
longitudinally pushers (13,31) provided with points

(113,131) facing the said seats and able to act on the
intermediate parts of the bases or caps held in the said

seats, the sections of channel (212,229) disposed down-line
from the said seats being made with a width slightly less

than the external width or the width of the widest external
area of the base or of the cap, so that when the said first

pushers come into operation and their points act on the
intermediate part of the base or cap, these enclosing

elements enter into the downline orientation channels
(212,229) where they slide with greater friction in the area

close to the rounded end which offers greater resistance to
crushing, so that, under the thrust of the points of the

first pushers, the base and cap of the capsule become
orientated with their openings
 forwards and become disposed 
above or below the said points of the pushers, while their

rounded ends interact with the front ends of the pushers
which transfer the base and cap into the terminal part of

the said horizontal orientation channels, with the opening
forwards and with a substantially horizontal disposition,

the said first pushers being then made to return to the idle
position, and the base and the cap in the terminal part of

the horizontal orientation channels being made, while
another base and cap are fed into the seats (10,28) in front

of the said pushers, to engaged with second pushers (21,44)
which make them slide in vertical channels (312,329) which

have the same width as the said first horizontal orientation
channels, follow the first channels, are orientated

downwards and which terminate preferably with wider lower
sections (20,42), the second pusher (21) operating with the

base being made to touch the base with its flat and
substantially horizontal end (121), so that the base

descends horizontally and enters the wider terminal part of
the descending channel, under which there is a waiting

aligned supporting socket (1), connected
below to suction means (22), the closed end of the base

being made to enter the said socket, so that under the
effect of the suction the said base enters the supporting

socket and is disposed vertically therein, with the opening
upwards, the said second pusher being then made to return to

the upper idle position, while the said first pusher repeats
the cycle described, exactly in phase; the second pusher

(44) operating with the cap (23) being made to touch the cap
in the intermediate part with its end point (144) which

causes the cap to rotate with its opening downwards and 
causes the said cap to be located laterally with respect to

the point, bearing on a shaped portion (45) of the pusher
which vertically transfers the cap into the wider lower part

of the ascending channel, under which there is a waiting
aligned supporting socket (2) through which there

passes axially from below a hollow rod (36) which is
connected below to suction means and whose upper end waits

in the wide part of the said channel so that it can be
inserted into the cap and retain it by suction, so that,

while the second pusher (44) rises again and the orientation
cycle is repeated, the rod with the cap returns to the low

position assumed at the start of the cycle and inserts the
cap into the supporting socket, with a vertical disposition

and with the opening facing downwards, any necessary doses
of medicinal product (47) and any plugs (48) or other

substances then being introduced into the cap, and the
socket with the base being aligned and disposed below the

socket with the cap,
after which the base is raised by a pusher (46) while a

check piece (50) is disposed on the cap to retain it in its
socket, so that when the base is raised it is joined to the

cap and forms a sealed capsule, the upper check piece being
raised subsequently in phase with the raising of the lower

pusher or being eliminated, for the expulsion of the sealed
capsule through the upper socket which previously retained

the cap and for the lateral removal of the capsule towards
collecting means, with the additional aid of an air jet (51).
Device according to Claim 1, in which the width of the
horizontal and vertical channel sections (212,312,229,329) 

for the orientation of the bases and caps is a few
hundredths or one or a few tenths of a millimetre less than

the external width or the widest external area of the bases
and caps, in accordance with the dimensions and/or the

characteristics of the said bases and caps.
Device according to Claim 1, in which the bases and caps
(3,23) are fed to vertical seats (10,28) from vertical tubes

or pipes (5,25) located above, and provided
in their lower parts with stop devices (7,27) which

allow one enclosing element to drop whenever the tubes are
lowered and are close to the said seats, and whose upper

ends penetrate into the' bottom of the magazines of the bases
and caps so that they are loaded with these enclosing

elements which are disposed in single file in the tubes, in
axial alignment and in coaxial orientation, the means which

raise and lower the said tubes being made to cause the
reciprocating displacement of the first pushers (13,31)

which complete their active stroke while the tubes are
raised, while the second pushers (21,44) are made integral

with the tubes so that these elements complete their active
operating stroke together.
Device according to Claim 1, in which the point (131) of
the first pusher (13) for the orientation of the bases (3)

has a length equal to or greater than half the length of a
base, has the form of an isosceles triangle laterally, and

its end surfaces (16,116), following the upper and lower
surfaces (15,115) of the said point, are perpendicular to

the latter surfaces or are shaped in any other suitable way.
Device according to Claim 1, in which the base (3) is
introduced into the supporting socket (1) through the empty 

socket (2) lying above it for supporting the cap of the
capsules, which is aligned and disposed above the said

socket and which, due to a greater internal
width, simplifies the entry of the base by suction into the

lower supporting socket.
Device according to Claim 1, in which the point (131) of
the first pusher (13) for the orientation of the caps (23)

has a length not less than half the length of the caps and
has the form of an right,angle triangle laterally, with the

oblique side upwards and with a horizontal lower side, while
the end surfaces (35,36) of the said pusher are

perpendicular to the said lower and upper surfaces (33,34)
of the point or are shaped in any convenient way.
Device according to Claim 1, in which the seat (28) to
which a cap (23) to be orientated is fed cyclically is

provided in its lower part with internal and opposing
supports (37,137), which do not interfere with the initial

orientation pusher (31), and which have the function of
supporting the cap in a zone close to the equatorial zone of

its closed end when this end is orientated downwards and,
conversely, of supporting the cap at the edge of the opening

when this is downwards, so that in the latter case the cap
is stopped in a position at a higher level than in the other

case, and is disposed with the equatorial zone (123) of the
rounded end suitably higher than the point (131) of the

initial orientation pusher, which can thus act correctly on
the cap regardless of the orientation of the latter.
Device according to Claim 7, in which the supports
(37,137) disposed on the base of the seat (28) which

cyclically receives a cap (23) to be orientated may be 
adjusted with respect to their degree of projection and/or

the height, for adaptation to caps which, within a single
format, may have slight variations of shape and/or

dimensions.
Device according to Claim 7, in which the supports
disposed on the base of the seat (28) which cyclically

receives a cap (23) to be orientated are formed by the upper
and upwardly diverging ends (139,239) of a fork (39), which

slides and is guided in a groove (40,140) formed
transversely in the said seat, the said fork being connected

below to means of adjustment (41) which, when commanded, can
lower or raise the fork for adaptation of its ends to caps

which, within a single format, may have slight variations of
shape and/or dimensions.
Device according to Claim 1, in which the descending
channel (329), in which the second pusher for orientating

the caps operates, is provided with a longitudinal external
band (43) which has a width substantially equal to that of

the lower terminal section (42) of the said channel, for the
purpose of reducing the 
frictional effect which this channel
may exert on the open end of the cap and consequently to

favour the downward rotation of the cap by the said pusher.
Device according to Claim 1, in which the second pusher
(44) for orientating the caps (23) has a point (144) with

the side (45) facing the initial orientation channel having
a profile suitable for the controlled displacement of the

cap with a vertical disposition.
Device according to Claim 1, in which the sockets (1,2)
to which are fed the bases (3) and caps (23) of the capsules

to be sealed, with filling of the bases if necessary, are 
disposed on a carousel-type enclosing machine,

while the parts used for orientating and feeding the
bases and caps to the said sockets may be disposed in any

way with respect to the said carousel to enable the latter
to operate with a substantially intermittent motion or with

a continuous motion at high speed.
