<ABSTRACT>
A compound comprising a means to direct the compound to a nucleic acid within a cell and a radioactive moiety capable of destroying adjacent biological matter. It is preferred that the means to direct the compound comprise an antisense oligonucleotide. The antisense oligonucleotide may be complementary to DNA or RNA specifically forming part of a gene for the mutant ras protein, the mutant p53 protein, the bcr ab1 protein or an HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) protein, for example the HIV gag, pol, env or sor gene products. The compound may additionally comprise a targeting portion to target the compound to a desired cell type, for example it may comprise an MAb or part thereof specific for a tumour-specific or virus-specific antigen.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to therapeutic compounds useful in the treatment
of neoplasms (ie cancers, tumours), viral diseases and other conditions.It is known, at least on a theoretical basis, to administer antisense
oligonucleotides (DNA or RNA) to inhibit the function in vivo of the
corresponding sense nucleotides (DNA or RNA). Such antisense
oligonucleotides are disclosed by Tullis in EP 92574 B1.EP 0 490 434 describes labelled modified oligonucleotides useful for gene
therapy.WO 90/10448 describes covalent conjugates of a lipid and oligonucleotide.WO 89/12110 describes a polynucleotide probe with a plurality of signalling
moieties.WO 91/04753 describes conjugates consisting of one or more antisense
oligonucleotides bound to a ligand binding molecule which recognises a cell
surface molecule.We now provide improved compounds incorporating antisense oligonucleotides.The invention provides a compound comprising a means to direct the compound
to a nucleic acid within a cell and a radioactive moiety which, in use, destroys
adjacent biological matter, particularly nucleic acid.It is preferred that the means to direct the compound comprises an antisense
oligonucleotide. Antisense oligonucleotides are single-stranded nucleic acid, which can
specifically bind to a complementary nucleic acid sequence. By binding to the
appropriate target sequence, an RNA-RNA, a DNA-DNA, or RNA-DNA
duplex is formed. These nucleic acids are often termed "antisense" because
they are complementary to the sense or coding strand of the gene. Recently,
formation of a triple helix has proven possible where the oligonucleotide is
bound to a DNA duplex. It was found that oligonucleotides could recognise
sequences in the major groove of the DNA double helix. A triple helix was
formed thereby. This suggests that it is possible to synthesise sequence-specific
molecules which specifically bind double-stranded DNA via recognition of
major groove hydrogen binding sites. By binding to the target nucleic acid, the above oligonucleotides can inhibit the
function of the target nucleic acid. This could, for example, be a result of
blocking the transcription, processing, poly(A) addition, replication, translation,
or promoting inhibitory mechanisms of the cells, such as promoting RNA
degradations.The antisense oligonucleotide can be used to selectively suppress certain cellular
functions. For example, in oncogenic transformed cells, oligonucleotides
complementary to the oncogene suppress its expression. An antisense
oligonucleotide has been
