<ABSTRACT>
A method of obtaining high quality passivation 
layers on silicon carbide surfaces by oxidizing a 

sacrificial layer of a silicon-containing material on a 
silicon carbide portion of a device structure to 

substantially consume the sacrificial layer to produce an 
oxide passivation layer on the silicon carbide portion 

that is substantially free of dopants that would 
otherwise degrade the electrical integrity of the oxide 

layer. The oxidizing of the sacrificial layer is preferably 
achieved by thermal oxidizing. The silicon carbide portion 

may be of p-type silicon carbide which is aluminium doped.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
passivating microelectronic structures and in particular
relates to passivation of silicon carbide structures
using silicon dioxide.Silicon carbide (SiC) has a number of theoretical
and practical advantages that make its use desirable in
microelectronic devices. These advantages are fairly
well known and include a wide band gap, a high breakdown
field, high thermal conductivity, high electron drift
velocity, excellent thermal stability, and excellent
radiation resistance or "hardness." These advantages
have been recognized and described thoroughly in the
patent and nonpatent literature.One of the chemical advantages of silicon carbide is
its ability to form a stable and well understood oxide,
namely silicon dioxide (SiO2), that can be used to
passivate silicon carbide structure and devices. As
known to those familiar with electronic devices, an
appropriate thermally-grown oxide passivation layer
provides an associated advantageous oxide-semiconductor
interface that largely eliminates the presence of
dangling bonds (sometimes referred to as dangling
valences) on the semiconductor surface, and thus largely 
eliminates the associated problems such as interface
charges and traps.There are, however, some problems that arise from
silicon dioxide passivation on silicon carbide because of
certain properties of silicon carbide. In particular, a
common p-type dopant for silicon carbide is aluminum.
Although aluminum gives the highest p-type conductivity
in silicon carbide, it recently has been discovered that
the presence of aluminum incorporated into the thermally
grown oxide passivation layers on p-type silicon carbide
tend to cause high fixed oxide charge and high trap
density at the silicon dioxide-silicon carbide interface.
If the aluminum concentration is sufficiently high (for
example when an oxide is grown on p+ silicon carbide) the
resulting oxide can have very high leakage currents,
rendering it disadvantageous or even useless for
passivation or electrical isolation. This problem does
not occur when passivating silicon with silicon dioxide
because aluminum is not a common dopant for silicon.As a result of these characteristics, when thermally
grown oxides have been used to passivate structures such
as mesa p+n- junctions in silicon carbide, the resulting
devices tend to demonstrate excessive leakage currents in
reverse bias at relatively high voltages (i.e., greater
than 50 volts). This leakage current is apparently
caused by the poor quality of the
