<ABSTRACT>
A multipurpose bucket structure for carrying long 
materials, for pulling down a building into pieces and 

taking away the pieces, for disassembling an automobile 
and taking away the parts, for working with a 

large-sized tool, for digging the ground, for putting 
the area destroyed by a disaster in order, for carrying 

ready-mixed concrete and for carrying concrete 
blocks or secondary products of concrete. In the 

bucket structure, an openable bucket (6) is attached in an 
openable manner to a body bucket (1) by an actuating cylinder (31), 

and the buckets are formed with tooth (23,24) portions 
for grasping the materials. The bucket structure thus 

constructed of those body bucket (1) and openable bucket (6) 
can be swiveled in a plane normal to the opening/closing 

direction of the openable bucket (6). The openable 
bucket (6) is automatically locked in its closed position 

and in any open angle position. On the other hand, 
the swivel mechanism is equipped with a lock mechanism 

for locking the swivel position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a multipurpose 
bucket structure to be attached to the leading end 
portion of an arm of a constructing machine such as a 
power shovel. In the prior art, a working machine such as the 
constructing machine or the power shovel can be used 
according to its function for constructing works such 
as a trench digging operation. Because of this 
simplified function, the machine cannot be sufficiently 
applied to various constructing works. For example, the power shovel of the prior art 
has a single bucket which is attached to the leading 
end portion of its arm but which is not equipped with 
any cover. Some power shovel is so modified as to 
have various attachments. In either case, the functions 
are so restricted that the working efficiency  
 
cannot be enhanced to meet the term of works. Therefore, an object of the present invention is 
to provide a multipurpose bucket structure for carrying 
long materials, for pulling down a building into 
pieces and taking away the pieces, for disassembling 
an automobile and taking away the parts, for working 
with a large-sized tool, for digging the ground, for 
putting the area destroyed by a disaster in order, for 
carrying ready-mixed concrete and for carrying concrete 
blocks or secondary products of concrete. Specifically, according to the present invention, 
there is provided a multipurpose bucket structure 
which comprises: a body bucket forming an upper jaw; 
and an openable bucket forming a lower jaw, wherein 
said buckets are so hinged to each other that their 
leading end portions can be opened and closed, and 
wherein each of said buckets is formed on its opening 
peripheral edge with one or more tooth portions. With 
this construction, the bucket structure is enabled, 
with its openable bucket being opened, to dig like the 
prior art by its body bucket and to carry long materials 
by grasping them between the tooth portions of its 
leading end.  In an invention, as defined in another claim of 
the present invention, a gap is formed between the 
peripheral edge of the opening of the body bucket and 
the peripheral edge of the opening of the openable 
bucket to grasp the long materials more easily and is 
closed with a removable cover. In this closed state, 
the inside defined by the closed body and openable 
buckets is completely sealed up to carry a fluid material 
such as cement mortar therein. Since the bucket 
structure can carry the fluid materials such as cement 
milk, it is conceivable to place the concrete
