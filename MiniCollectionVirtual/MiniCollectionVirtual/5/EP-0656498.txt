<ABSTRACT>
A controller comprises a valve body (1) having a 
valve element (6) and a valve seat (4) defining therebetween a 

fluid channel (11a) openable and closable with reciprocating 
upward and downward movement of a valve stem (2), a casing (61) 

fixed to an upper portion of the valve body, an operating 
rod (21) provided in an upper inside portion (65) of the 

casing and movable upward and downward, a drive device (20) 
for moving the operating rod upward and downward, and a 

force transmission device (41) provided in a lower inside 
portion (63) of the casing for transmitting a force acting 

on the operating rod to the valve stem. The transmission 
device comprises a conical first roller contact 

member (26) extending vertically downward from a lower end 
of the operating rod (21), a second roller contact member (19) 

provided at an upper end of the valve stem (2), a pair of 
roller support members (43) arranged between the two contact 

members symmetrically with respect to the axis of the 
first contact member, a pair of rollable rollers (46) each 

rotatably supported by the support member at an upper 
portion thereof and bearing on a tapered face (26a) of the 

first contact member, and a pair of push rollers (45) each 
rotatably supported by the support member at a lower 

portion thereof and bearing on a roller support upper 
surface (19a) of the second contact member. Each of the  

 
roller support members is supported by the casing so 

as to be pivotally movable about an axis on the side of 
the axis of the first contact member relative to the axis 

of the corresponding push roller.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to controllers
for opening and closing a fluid channel according to the preamble of claim 1. Such a controller is known from US-A-5 108 069.Controllers are already known which include
those adapted to close a fluid channel by a valve
stem biased downward by a spring and to open the fluid
channel by driving the valve stem upward with a force
of pneumatic pressure, solenoid or the like which is
greater than the force of the spring, and those adapted
to open a fluid channel by a valve stem biased upward
with a spring and to close the fluid channel by urging
the valve stem downward with a force of pneumatic
pressure, solenoid or the like which is greater than
the force of the spring.In the case where such conventional
controllers are used for high-pressure fluids, there
arises a need to use an increased force for closing
the fluid channel to prevent leakage of the fluid.
However, the controller wherein the valve stem is
biased downward by a spring to close the fluid channel
and driven upward by pneumatic pressure, solenoid or
the like to open the fluid channel has the problem that 
the channel closing force can not be increased as
required because an increase in the force of the
spring necessitates an increase in the pneumatic or
like force for driving the valve stem but the increase
in the driving force is limited. The controller
wherein the valve stem is biased upward by a spring
to open the fluid channel and urged downward with a
force of pneumatic pressure, solenoid or the like
which is greater than the spring force to close the
fluid channel has a similar problem since an increase
in the channel closing force requires an increase in
the pneumatic or like downward urging force.An object of the present invention is to
provide a controller wherein the fluid channel closing
force can be increased as required without increasing
pneumatic pressure, elastic force of spring or drive
force of solenoid or the like and which is therefore
usable for high-pressure fluids with leakage of the
fluid prevented reliably.The terms "upward" and "downward" are herein
used with reference to the state of the present device
in use as shown in FIG. 1.The controller embodying the present invention
comprises a valve body having a valve element 
and a valve seat defining therebetween a fluid channel
openable and closable with reciprocating upward and
downward movement of a valve stem, a casing fixed to
an upper portion of the valve body, an operating rod
provided in-an upper inside portion of the

A controller comprising a valve body (1) having a valve
element (5) and a valve seat (4) defining therebetween a

fluid channel (11a) openable and closable with reciprocating
upward and downward movement of a valve stem (2), a

casing (61) fixed to an upper portion of the valve body (1),
an operating rod (21) provided in an upper inside portion

of the casing (61) and movable upward and downward, drive
means (2⊘) for moving the operating rod (21) upward and

downward, and force transmission means (41) provided in a
lower inside portion of the casing
 (61) for transmitting
a force acting on the operating rod (21) to the valve

stem (2), the force transmission means (41) comprising a
conical first roller contact member (26) extending

vertically downward from a lower end of the operating rod
(21), a second roller contact member (19) provided at an

upper end of the valve stem (2), and rollers (45, 46)
