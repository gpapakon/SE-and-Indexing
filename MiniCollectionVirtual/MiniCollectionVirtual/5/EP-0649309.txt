<ABSTRACT>
Use of at least one biocompatible, bioabsorbable calcium salt in the form of particles smaller than 8 mm as active principle in the preparation of a medicament for local treatment of bone deminerilizing diseases or bone mineralization disorders by implantation thereof in the spongy portion or medullary canal of the bone, particularly for restarting the process of bone remineralization and reconstruction of the absorbed trabeculae of bone. In patients suffering from osteoporosis, for example, this treatment shows reinitialization of the remineralization process and reconstruction of the trabeculae of bone, with a considerable increase in the bone stock of the bone treated.

<CLAIMS>
Use of at least one biocompatible and bioabsorbable calcium
salt, in the form of particles, having dimensions less than 8 mm, as active

ingredient in the preparation of a medicament intended for local treatment
of diseases associated with demineralization or mineralization defects of

bone, with the aim of reinitiating the process of bone remineralization.
Use according to Claim 1, characterized in that the said
diseases are osteoporosis, Paget's disease, fibrous dysplasias and

osteodystrophies.
Use according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the said medicament is intended to be implanted in

the spongy part or in the medullary canal of a bone.
Use according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the said calcium salt is chosen from among the

following: gluconate, tartarate, glycerophosphate, sulphate, carbonate and
phosphates.
Use according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the said calcium salt is a carbonate.
Use according to the preceding claim, characterized in that
the said carbonate is in the form of aragonite or calcite.
Use according to the preceding claim, characterized in that
the said carbonate comes from coral skeletons, echinoderm skeletons or

mollusc shells.
Use according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the active ingredient is phosphate-free.
Use according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the said particles have dimensions less than 5 mm,

and in particular dimensions which can range from 0.2 to 4 mm.
Use according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the said particles are mixed with at least one

substance promoting osteogenesis and/or allowing the said particles to be
put into the form of a fluid paste.
Use according to the preceding claim, characterized in that
the said substance is chosen from salts of strontium, fluorides, growth

factors, blood, blood plasma, bone marrow, collagen, a biological
adhesive and a biocompatible gelling agent. 
Use according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the calcium salt represents from 40 to 100 % by

weight with respect to the total weight of the medicament.
