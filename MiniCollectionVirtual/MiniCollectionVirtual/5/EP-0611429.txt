Arrangement for sealing an interspace (4) between 
an external housing (1) and an internal fitting, in 

particular an internal housing (2) of a steam turbine, 
having as sealing element an intermediate ring (3) which 

is a tube length of approximately L-shaped cross-section 
and which is held on a first end (31) in a vertically 

movable fashion and on a second end (33), where it has a 
ring foot (33) having at least one sealing support 

surface (37), in a laterally movable fashion, characterised 
in that the ring foot (33) points outwards from the 

intermediate ring (3) and the intermediate ring (3) has 
in its interior a ring flank (32) which tapers conically 

from the first end (31) to the second end (33). 
Arrangement according to Claim 1, in which 

a) the intermediate ring (3) has on its first end (31) 
a ring rim engaging in the manner of a fitting key 

in a ring groove (11) of the external housing (1); 
b) the ring foot (33) is situated in a pot-shaped 
recess (6) of the internal fitting (2). 
Arrangement according to Claim 2, in which a 
bottom gap (5) which is connected to the interspace (4) 

via at least one relief opening (34) is present outside, 
near the support surface (37). 
Arrangement according to Claim 3, characterised 
in that the relief opening (34) is a bore or recess in 

the ring foot (33). 
Arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the ring foot (33) is held outside 

on the internal fitting by means of a retaining plate 
(9).  

 
Arrangement according to Claim 5, characterised 
in that the ring foot (33) is pressed against the internal 

fitting by the retaining plate (9) by means of 
prestressing. 
Arrangement according to Claim 5 or 6, characterised 
in that the ring foot (33) has an auxiliary 

support surface (35) on its outside. 
Arrangement according to Claim 5, 6 or 7, characterised 
in that the retaining plate (9) is fastened on 

the internal fitting by means of bolts (7). 
Arrangement according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the intermediate ring (3) 

is a component of a steam line leading through the 
interspace (4) into the internal fitting.
