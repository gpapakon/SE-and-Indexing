<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for controlling and influencing running picture sequences or individual pictures and interactive video scenes and/or picture sequences faster than the reaction time (real time) which can be perceived by the human eye, preferably in a simulator or firing range. The picture, picture sequences or video scenes are influenced by light-optical means and/or mechanically, and the signals produced thereby are received and are used, with the aid of a computer having data compression hardware and software, to resolve new or changed pictures, picture sequences or video scenes in real time in accordance with a JPEG (Joint Photographic Expert Group) and MPEG (Motion Picture Expert Group) method which is known per se, a hard-disk memory (HDD) being used as the recording and playback equipment. The invention furthermore relates to a device for carrying out the method. In this case, at least one apparatus (W1,Wn) is used which is constructed as a hand-held firearm and is constructed such that it can be operated using suitable ammunition, each hand-held firearm having a sensor (S1,Sn) for recording a fired shot, which sensor transmits the received signals by means of a transmitter, which is installed in the hand-held firearm, or an electrical connecting cable (Tr1,Trn) to a receiver (R) which is connected to the input of the computer.
