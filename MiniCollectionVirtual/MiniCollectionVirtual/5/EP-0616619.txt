<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to fire retardant
or fire resistant alkenylaromatic foams.There is a need to improve the fire retardant
properties of plastic foams. Various steps have been
taken to improve the fire retardant properties of
thermoplastic polymers in order to make them slower to
ignite and to retard flame propagation. Thermoplastic
polymers can be rendered flame retardant by compounding
with fire retardant additives, including halogenated
organic compounds and inorganic compounds such as
antimony oxide. Brominated organic compounds have been
used in both foamed and nonfoamed alkenylaromatic
polymer compositions. "Fire Resistance Finishing of
Thermoplastics as Represented by the Example of
Polystyrene," CA87 (24):185432e, discloses an unfoamed
polystyrene composition containing as flame retardants
hexabromocyclododecane, nonabromobiphenyl or
decabromodiphenyl ether in combination with antimony
oxide. "Heat And Flame Resistant Thermoplastic
Polymers," CA81 (12):64729z, discloses a nonfoamed,
impact resistant polystyrene having incorporated therein 
hexabromobenzene, tribromophenyl allyl ether and
hexabromocyclododecane.While effective in improving flame retardancy,
the incorporation of flame retardant additives into
thermoplastic polymer compositions is associated with a
variety of problems. Such problems include obtaining
homogeneous blending of the matrix resin with the fire
retardant additives. Failure to obtain a homogeneous
blend can contribute to poor fire retardant ratings.
There is a further problem in that fire retardant
additives tend to degrade the appearance of the product
and can negatively affect physical properties such as
impact strength, particularly at higher levels of such
additives. In nonfoamed polymers, the bromine content
is typically quite high, for example, in excess of 5
parts of bromine per 100 parts of alkenylaromatic
polymer.In foamed alkenylaromatic polymers, the degree
of bromine loading has to be significantly lower to
avoid detrimentally impacting the structural qualities
and skin quality of the foam. It is common to use only
brominated aliphatics in foamed polystyrenes, with
hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) being the most commonly
used foamed alkenylaromatic polymer fire retardant.
Following current industry practice, the use of
brominated aliphatic compounds as fire retardants for
thermoplastic polymer foams requires an increase in the
fire retardant level as the thickness of the foam
increases in order to meet industry test standards such
as ASTM E-84,
