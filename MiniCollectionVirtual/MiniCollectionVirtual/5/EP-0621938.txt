<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to 
combustion processes and more particularly to a method and 
apparatus for controlling the fuel to air ratio of surface 
combustion burners. Surface combustion burners offer an excellent method 
for minimizing nitric oxide and carbon monoxide formation in 
gaseous fuel combustion, as well as providing high radiative 
heat transfer in commercial and industrial applications. The 
control of the fuel/air ratio or stoichiometry in these fully 
premixed systems is critical to realizing the benefits of this 
type of burner. To achieve control, fuel/air control 
techniques based on the optical emission from the burner 
surface have been developed in the past. Standard techniques 
rely on a sensor signal indicative of the amount of oxygen 
(O2) or carbon monoxide (CO) in the flue gas to modify the 
fuel input to a burner. Apparatus operating in accordance 
with the prior art cannot effectively control systems with 
multiple burners, as the emission from each burner is co-mingled 
in the flue. Therefore, one burner may run fuel rich 
while another is running fuel lean. U.S. Patent No. 4,927,350 discloses a method of 
combustion control which determines at various loads a 
fuel/air peak relationship for the peak infrared radiation. A 
desired operating fuel/air ratio is computed as the offset 
between the relationship and the ratio. Recalibration of the 
control system is later established by determining the new 
fuel/air peak relationship and the offset is applied to 
control the surface combustion burner.  
 U.S. Patent No. 4,959,010 discloses an automatically 
regulated combustion process. In the '010 process, fuel is 
mixed with an oxygen containing gas in an adjustable ratio. 
The exhaust gas produced by the burning is exposed to 
ultraviolet radiation, generating positive and negative charge 
carriers in the exhaust gas by means of a photoelectric charge 
separation process. The amount or kind of the positive and/or 
negative charge carriers is detected to produce a measurement 
value which reflects the amount and/or the charge of the 
carriers. A control signal is derived therefrom and the 
mixture ratio of the oxygen contained gas and the fuel (lambda 
factor) is adjusted in response to the control signal in order 
to improve the efficiency of the combustion. U.S. Patent No. 5,037,291 discloses a method and 
apparatus for optimizing fuel to air ratio in a combustion gas 
of a radiant burner. The flow rate of the gaseous fuel supply 
is held constant and the flow
