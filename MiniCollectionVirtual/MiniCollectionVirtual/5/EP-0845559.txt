<ABSTRACT>
The overflow has a housing (2), fastened to an overflow aperture (3) at the back of the bath (1). A diaphragm-like sealing element (4) is fitted into the overflow aperture. The element engages with its outer end (5) sealing on the outside (1a) of the bath, and with its inner end (6) on the inside (16) of the bath. The sealing element is bellows-shaped between its ends, which are formed as flanges. The inner element is clamped to the edge (3a) of the overflow via a fastener flange (7), and a slide ring (9) is located between them. The outer end is fastened to the housing via locking elements (11).
