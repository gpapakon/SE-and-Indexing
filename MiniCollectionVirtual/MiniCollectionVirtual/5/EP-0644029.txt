<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an apparatus (10) for 
injection molding a thin-walled plastic article (12) with 

substantially equal thickness sidewalls (14), a base portion 
(16), and a lip portion (18). The apparatus includes a two 

part mold arrangement (20, 22) in which a first part (20) 
defines a mold cavity (24) and a second part (22) defines a 

mold core (26). The first and second mold parts in a mold 
closed position define a mold space (28) in the shape of the 

article being molded. The apparatus further includes two or 
more gates (42) adjacent a lip portion of the mold space for 

injecting molten plastic material into the mold space and a 
bottom center venting arrangement (48). The apparatus 

further includes a restriction (32, 34, 36) in the mold 
space for improving the operation of the bottom center 

venting arrangement and providing a more balanced filling in 
a multi-cavity molding machine.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for
injection molding plastic articles and for an improved
venting arrangement for use therein according to the first part of
claim 1.Various types of elongated, thin-walled, molded plastic
articles are presently manufactured and used for many
different purposes. Such articles include containers, open-ended
pails, parts for ball-point pens, probe cover devices,
and sheaths. A number of different molding apparatuses are
used to manufacture these articles.US-A-3,660,002, 3,978,186,
4,381,275, 4,622,002,
4,726,925, 4,743,420, and 4,764,103
and EP-A-0 124
951 illustrate some of the apparatuses used to
manufacture the aforementioned articles. Generally, each of
the molding systems illustrated in these patents includes a
mold having a first part defining a mold cavity and a second
part defining a mold core. Each of the mold cores and
respective mold cavities when in a mold closed position
define a mold space in the shape of the article to be
manufactured. In some systems, such as EP-A-0 124 951, the
mold cavity is defined by two parts which move relative to
each other to facilitate removal of the molded article. The plastic material used to form the molded article
can be injected into the mold space in a variety of
different ways. As shown in the US-A-4,743,420 and 4,764,103, it
is known to inject the molten plastic material through a
central gate adjacent the portion of the mold space forming
the bottom of the molded article. This type of gating
arrangement has traditionally been used in many injection
molding machines. In other systems, such as that shown in
the US-A-4,381,275, molten plastic material is injected
into the mold space through gates positioned along sidewall
defining portions of the mold space. Still further, it is
known to inject molten plastic material into that portion of
the mold space defining a lip of the article. The US-A-4,622,002
illustrates one such system.Another patent which illustrates a system for injecting
molten plastic material into the lip portion of the space
defining the article to be molded is US-A-5,145,630.
In the US-A-5,145,630-system, the molten plastic
material is injected into the mold space at the lip portion
using multiple injection gates in a manner which does not
sacrifice core/cavity alignment. In other words, the molten
material is injected into the mold space in a manner which
substantially avoids shifting of the mold core.Still another approach for injecting molten plastic
material into a mold space defining a

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus (10) for injection molding a thin-walled
plastic article (12) with sidewalls (14), a base portion

(16), and a lip portion (18), said sidewalls having a
substantially equal thickness, comprising:


a two part mold (20, 22) in which a first part (20)
defines a mold cavity (24) and a second part (22)

defines a mold core (26);
said first and second parts in a mold closed position
defining a mold space (28) in the shape of said plastic

article;
means (42) for injecting molten material into said
mold space;
means (48) for venting air from said mold space as
said molten material is injected therein; and
said mold space including means (32, 34, 36) for restricting
the flow of said molten material through said

space and for improving the operation of said venting
means;

characterized in that
said venting means comprises a first vent member (50)
and a sleeve portion (52) surrounding said first vent

member, said sleeve portion being movable relative to

said first vent member and defining main vents (54) with
said first vent member for removing air from a bottom

portion (32) of said mold space.
The apparatus of claim 1 further being characterized by
said venting means further comprises a centrally positioned

vent passageway (56) within said first vent member,
said centrally positioned vent passageway removing

air from the bottom portion of said mold space when said
main vents are closed. 
An apparatus (10) of claim 1 or 2, characterized in that
said mold space (28) includes side wall defining portions

(34, 36) and said bottom defining portion (32),
said side wall defining portions (34, 36) has a first

thickness and said bottom defining portion (32) has a
second thickness, said first thickness and said second

thickness are related so as to restrict the flow of said
molten material through the mold space and thereby

improves the operation of the venting means and balances
the flow of the molten material in the mold space;

and said restricting means comprises said second thickness
being smaller than said first thickness.
The apparatus of claim 3 further being characterized by
said second thickness being defined by the equation:


T
bot
 = 0,75 x t
wall
(min) - core shift

where

t
bot
= said second thickness;
t
wall
min
= a minimum value for said first
thickness; and
core shift
= a degree of shifting of said mold core
(26).
The apparatus of claim 3 further being characterized by
said second thickness being defined by the equation:


t
bot
 = HD x t
wall
(min);

where

t
bot
= said second thickness;
t
wall
(min)
= a minimum value for said first
thickness; and
HD
= a variable dependent upon the ratio of the
height of said plastic article to the bottom diameter

of said plastic article.
The apparatus of claim 1 further being characterized by: 

said injecting means comprising at least two gates (42)
spaced about a portion of said mold space defining a lip

portion (30) of said article; and
said injecting means further comprising a hot runner
nozzle (46) associated with each of said at least two

gates.
