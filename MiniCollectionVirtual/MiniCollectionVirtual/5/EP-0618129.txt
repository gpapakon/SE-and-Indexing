<ABSTRACT>
A passenger compartment of a motor vehicle, in particular a passenger car, with a ridgeless (continuous, stepless) hatchback (fastback, square back), has a rear flap (17), which can be pivoted about a horizontal axis (18) at its upper end and which comprises a rear flap frame (20) and rear flap window (21). The rear flap window (21) can be pivoted about a horizontal axis (22), which lies at its upper edge, independently of the particular pivoted position of the rear flap or rear flap frame. The rear flap window can be pivoted into the passenger compartment from its closed position, preferably with the rear flap frame in the closed position at the same time, into a position in which it seals off the passenger compartment to the rear.   By virtue of the above-listed features of the hatchback, the possibilities for using hatchback vehicles of this kind can be substantially expanded.

Motor vehicle, in particular passenger car, with 
stepless sloping rear, with a passenger compartment 

comprising a rear door which is pivotable at its upper end 
about a horizontal axis and which consists of rear door 

frame and rear door window, wherein the rear door window 
can be pivoted about a horizontal axis located at its upper 

edge independently of the respective pivot position of the 
rear door or rear door frame, characterised in that the 

rear door window (21) can be pivoted into the passenger 
compartment (13), out of its closed position - preferably 

with the rear door frame (20) also in the closed position 
- into a position closing off the passenger compartment at 

the rear. 
Motor vehicle according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the pivot axis (22) of the rear door window (21) in a 

manner known in the art coincides with the pivot axis (18) 
of the rear door frame (20), and is arranged at least in 

the vicinity of the pivot axis (22) of the rear door frame 
(20), beneath it. 
Motor vehicle according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the rear door window (21) can be pivoted into the 

interior of the passenger compartment (13) into a vertical 
or essentially vertical position and fixed in this 

position. 
Motor vehicle according to claim 1, 2 or 3, 
characterised in that inside the passenger compartment (13) 

is arranged an abutment frame (27) for the rear door window 
(21). 
Motor vehicle according to claim 4, characterised in 
that the abutment frame (27) comprises a peripheral sealing 

flange for sealing abutment of the rear door window (21).  
 
Motor vehicle according to claim 4 or 5, characterised 
in that the rear door window (21) at its edges comprises a 

peripheral sealing lip (28) (Fig. 7). 
Motor vehicle according to claim 6, characterised in 
that the peripheral sealing lip (28) is double-sided such 

that it allows sealing abutment on the one hand against the 
frame (27) inside the passenger compartment (13) and on the 

other hand against the rear door frame (20) (Fig. 7). 
Motor vehicle according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the free space arising in the 

region of the rear door (17) behind the rear door window 
(21) which is pivoted into the interior of the passenger 

compartment (13), serves as a loading space (loading 
platform 19) opening to the rear/top. 
Motor vehicle according to claim 8, characterised in 
that the rear door frame (20) which is in the closed 

position serves to fix retaining devices, preferably 
elastic retaining straps (32), for loaded (bulky) goods 

(31) (Figs. 2 and 10). 
Motor vehicle according to claim 8, characterised in 
that the free space arising in the region of the rear door 

(17) behind the rear door window (21) which is pivoted into 
the interior of the passenger compartment (13), forms a 

supporting surface (19) for a container (35) or trailer 
(38) to be mounted (Figs. 3 and 4). 
Motor vehicle according to claim 8, 9 or 10, 
characterised in that an angled retaining device (33) 

preferably of right-angled cross-section is arranged at the 
lower edge of the rear door frame (20) so as to be 

pivotable about a horizontal axis (34) (Figs. 1 to 5, 10, 
11 and 12).  

 
Motor vehicle according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the rear door frame (20) is 

shaped like a dish in such a way that it serves as a 
retaining frame for loaded (bulky) goods when the rear door 

window (21) is pivoted into the interior of the vehicle 
(Fig. 9). 
Motor vehicle according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, with removable (exchangeable) drive (so-called 

drive module), characterised in that a rear portion which 
increases the available vehicle space, preferably a rear 

module (42, 42a, 42b) with integrated drive (43, 43a), can 
be coupled to the passenger compartment (13) when the rear 

door (17) or rear door frame (20) is pivoted upwards and 
the drive (drive module 16) is removed beforehand, in such 

a way that the rear door (17) or the rear door frame (20) 
forms the roof surface or a portion thereof of the rear 

portion (42, 42a, 42b) which comprises a corresponding roof 
recess (44) (Figs. 14 to 16). 
Motor vehicle according to claim 13, characterised in 
that the rear door frame (20) serves as a connecting 

element for coupling the rear portion (42, 42a, 42b). 
Motor vehicle according to claim 13 or 14, 
characterised in that the rear door window (21) pivoted 

into the interior of the passenger compartment (13) serves 
for spatial separation of the driver's seat row (15) from 

the rear space of the whole vehicle supplemented by the 
coupled rear portion (42, 42a, 42b).
