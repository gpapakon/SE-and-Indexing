<ABSTRACT>
A manual device for treating iontophoresis consisting of a source of low 
voltage direct current housed in a manual operated case (5) containing cells 

(1) and (2), in which the grasping portion (6) for the user's hand (10) communicates 
with one of the terminals of the source of direct current, while the 

othet terminal contacts an insulated applicator head (3), so an iontophoresis 
circuit being made through the user's hand and body until the contacting portion 

with the applicator head, the direct current source being connected, via 
one of its terminals, to the applicator head, and via the other terminal to 

the electric conductive manual grasping portion.

<DESCRIPTION>
This specification refers to a manual device for treating iontophoresis 
by means of which the iontophoresis treatment can be 
manually carried out by the own user. The present invention applies to the industry devoted to the 
manufacture of ancillary apparatuses for Medicine, and it can be 
punctually used in the cosmetic field. Iontophoresis is a treatment starting from the application of 
an electric current to a zone on the human body, from which it is 
desired to attain a specially efficient absorption of medical and/ 
or cosmetic substances. The iontophoresis application envisages to apply a low voltage 
direct current on a given human body surface, so avoiding every 
kind of possible aggressive actions on the user's skin, the application 
of the electric current having a determined polarity, that 
is to say, positive or negative, being combined with the own polarity 
of the medical or cosmetic products to be applied, which is 
to be inverse to that of the electric current applied. In this way, the permeation absorption normally produced between 
the'substance deposited on the skin and the blood vessels 
located under the epidermis is enhanced by the repulsion action 
between the electric current passing through the desired corporal  
 
zone and the own polar particles contained in the product to 
be diffussed. Iontophoresis is performed, up till now, by means of apparatuses 
having some magnitude and under clinical or aesthetic treatments 
in specialized laboratories or surgeries. The apparatuses utilized are fed by the mains electric current 
that is to say, alternating current and, after the voltage of this 
alternating current is rectified and regulated, it is applied by 
an adequate means to the body area on which the treatment is to be 
performed. Nevertheless, the use of these special apparatuses of some magnitude 
limits the possibility of applying an iontophoresis treatment 
and increases its cost. An evident solution to this problem would be to rely on a device 
allowing the iontophoresis treatment to be applied by the own 
user, that is to say, a manual operated device used by the own - 
user, so making possible to appreciably extend the use of said 
treatment. The manual device for treating iontophoresis as proposed by the 
invention is defined as a device allowing a user to carry out, 
starting from it, a treatment performed by himself directly without 
the need of going to any medical center where these treatments are 
usually carried out, with a consequent substantial saving in -

1. A manual device for treating iontophoresis, characterized 
in that it is constituted starting from a source of low voltage 

direct current (1) and (2), housed in a manual operated case (5) 
in which the grasping portion (6) for an user's hand (10) 

communicates with one of the terminals of the source of direct 
current, while the other terminal contacts an applicator head 

(3), which is insulated with regard to said grasping portion (6), 
so allowing an iontophoresis circuit to be made through the user's 

hand (10) and the user's body until the portion contacting the 
applicator head (3). 
2.- A manual device for treating iontophoresis, according to - 
claim 1, characterized in that the source of direct current formed 

by cells or accumulators (1) and (2) is connected via one of 
their terminals to the applicator head (3), while via the other 

terminal is connected to the manual grasping portion, which is 
conductive. 
3.- A manual device for treating iontophoresis, according to 
any of the previous claims, characterized in that the cells or - 

accumulators (1) and (2) are contained in a case (5) having isolating 
features, the grasping portion of same being made of an 

electricity conductive material, and being connected to one of 
the terminals of the assembly of cells or accumulators, while the 

other terminal is connected to the applicator which has a lightly 
bulged tip structure (3).
