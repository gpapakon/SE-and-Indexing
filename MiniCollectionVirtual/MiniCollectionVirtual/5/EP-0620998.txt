<ABSTRACT>
The device for putting on elastic stockings without a tip comprises a sliding sock (1) and a base plate (5). The sliding sock (1) consists of a material having good sliding properties relative to the elastic stocking and has a sole part (2) extending approximately over the entire foot length and a top part (3) which is connected laterally to said sole part and surrounds the front of the foot. Before the elastic stocking (K) is put on, the sliding sock (1) is pulled over the foot and, after the elastic stocking has been put on, is pulled out forwards through the toe opening of said elastic stocking. The base plate (5) consists of elastically resilient material, preferably foam rubber. It is placed with its underside (5b) on the floor (F). The sole of the foot with the sliding sock (1) pulled over it and with the elastic stocking (K) partially pushed over the sliding sock can be supported on the upper side (5a) of said base plate having a braking effect. At least the upper side (5a) of the base plate (5) has a high friction coefficient relative to the elastic stocking. By means of the high friction resistance thus achieved between the upper side (5a) and the outer side of the elastic stocking (K), the latter is held firmly by frictional engagement relative to the base plate (5) while the foot which has very good sliding capability due to the sliding sock is pushed into the elastic stocking.
