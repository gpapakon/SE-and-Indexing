<ABSTRACT>
An elongate reinforcing member (11) for a sign panel (10), having in cross section a foot portion (16) for securing to the rear face of a sign panel (10) and a head portion (12) having a dove-tailed slot (33) for engagement with a trapezoidal shaped head at the end of a strap for passing around a supporting post. A sign is formed from a plurality of panels (10a, 10b) abutted edge-to-edge. A main elongate reinforcing member (11) has in cross section a transverse head (12) for attachment thereto of amounting device for the sign, and a depending leg (14) terminating in an offset foot (16) secured to the rear of a first said sign panel (10a) adjacent an abutting edge of said panel. An elongate co-operating member (21) has a generally L-shaped cross section comprising a foot portion (22) secured to the rear of an adjacent second said sign panel (10b) at the edge abutting the first panel (10a) and an upright portion (24) abutting the leg of the main reinforcing member. One of the reinforcing members has a flange (20) at the foot projecting into a recess (28) in the foot portion of the other reinforcing member (21). The head (12) of the reinforcing member is offset with respect to the leg (14) on the opposite side from the projection of the foot (16), to expose the foot for rivetting to the plate.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to mounting devices suitable
for the mounting of signs to supporting posts, although the
mounting devices in one or more aspects of the invention
could be used in other mounting situations.In a series of earlier patents, for example GB
1416734, GB 1533412 and GB 2021390, I disclosed mounting
devices suitable for securing a post to a reinforcing
channel on the rear of a sign panel, the channel mouth
being furnished with inturned lips to retain elements of
the mounting device. The mounting devices were typically
pressed from stainless steel sheet, and the reinforcing
channels were normally made from extruded aluminium. The
system has provided extremely successful for many years.In my earlier GB 1473644, I disclosed mounting devices
for fixing multi-panel signs to posts in which mirror image
extrusions are attached to the edge of two adjacent panels
and joined together, effectively providing a single
symmetrical device attached to both panels.The invention deals with the problem of forming larger
signs from two or more panels abutted edge to edge.
Conventionally some kind of construction or device is
provided to prevent light from passing through a gap
between adjacent panels, it being virtually impossible to
provide a light-tight joint between the panels by simple
abutment. Such devices or constructions which are used in
practice tend to be expensive, complicated, unreliable or 
in other ways unsatisfactory. I have conceived of a
construction which provides distinct advantages over some
of the available alternatives. The invention can
preferably employ an improved mounting device.According to a first aspect of the invention there is
provided an elongate reinforcing member for a sign panel,
having in cross-section a foot-portion for securing to the
rear face of a sign panel, a one-piece head portion having opposed
transverse projections which in use cooperate to retain
a strap for passing around a supporting post, and a leg
connecting the head and foot. The head is offset to one side with
respect to the leg, and the foot projects to the other side extending
beyond the head portion to expose the foot for rivetting to a sign panel.Preferably, the head portion has a dove-tailed slot
for engagement with a trapezoidal shaped head at the end of
a strap for passing around a supporting post, and more
preferably, said trapezoidal shaped head at one end at
least of the strap is cut in the flat sheet material of the
strap. A said trapezoidal shaped head may be provided by
the chamfered head of

An elongate reinforcing member (11) for a sign panel
(10) having in cross-section a foot-portion (15) for

securing to the rear face of a sign panel, a one-piece
head portion (12) and a leg (14) connecting the head and

foot, the head portion (12) being offset to one side with
respect to the leg (14) and having opposed transverse

projections which in use cooperate to retain a strap (30)
for passing around a supporting post, characterised in

that the foot (16) projects to the other side extending
beyond the head portion (12) to expose the foot (16) for

rivetting to a sign panel. 
A reinforcing member according to claim 1 wherein the
head (12) projects on both sides of the leg (14), but

more on one side than the other.
A reinforcing member according to claim 1 or claim 2
wherein the foot (16) projects on both sides of the

leg (14), but more on the side opposite that to which
the head (12) principally projects.
A reinforcing member according to any one of claims 1
to 3 wherein the head is provided with a dove-tailed

slot (33) for engagement with a trapezoidal shaped
head (34,36) at the end of a strap (30) for passing

around the supporting post.
A sign formed from:

(i) a plurality of panels (10a, 10b)
abutted edge-to-edge;
(ii) a main elongate reinforcing member (11)
of any one of claims 1 to 4, the foot

portion (16) of the reinforcing member
being secured to the rear of a first

said panel (10a) adjacent an abutting
edge of said panel;
(iii) an elongate co-operating reinforcing
member (21) having a generally L-shaped 

cross-section comprising a foot portion
(22) being secured to the rear of an

adjacent second said sign panel (10b)
at the edge abutting the first panel

(10a) and said upright portion (24)
abutting the leg (14) of the

reinforcing member, wherein one of the
elongate memberes (11,21) has a flange

(20) at the foot portion projecting
into a recess (28) in the foot portion

of the other reinforcing member.
A sign panel according to claim 5 wherein the top of
the upright portion (24) of the co-operating

reinforcingg member is offset (26) to engage under the
head (12) of the main reinforcing member (11).
A sign panel according to claim 5 or claim 6 wherein
said flange (20) is provided at the foot of the main

reinforcing member (11) an the recess (28) is
provided in the foot of the co-operating reinforcing

member (21).
