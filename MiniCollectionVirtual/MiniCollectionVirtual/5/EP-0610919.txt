<ABSTRACT>
Retainer spring for disc brake pads (7, 10), the pad carrier (11, 12) having a pad-free section (29) which extends radially outwards and on which a holding section of a retaining spring (18) can be secured, the retaining spring (18) being of symmetrical design and being produced from steel wire and comprising, in the centre of its axis of symmetry, a holding section that reaches around the pad-free section (29) of the pad carrier (11, 12) on all sides, and two resilient sections (42, 43) extending in opposite directions from the said holding section. On that side of the pad-free section (29) of the pad carrier (11, 12) that faces away from the brake pad (7, 10), the holding section of the retaining spring (18) is formed by a continuous V-shaped connecting section (36) and, on that side of the pad-free section (29) that faces the brake pad (7, 10), by two spring legs (37, 38) parallel to the V-shaped connecting section (36). At least one spring coil (40, 41) is formed in the region of the transition from each spring limb (37, 38) to a corresponding free spring limb (42, 43).

<CLAIMS>
Spring arrangement to secure brake pad / backing plate assemblies within a disc brake 
caliper, whereby the upper area of the brake pad backing plate (11, 12) is kept free of 

friction material (29) to accommodate the clamping section of a hold down spring 
(18) made of steel wire in a symmetric design which is wrapped around the centre of 

its symmetrical axis (A) with the two spring leg sections in opposite directions 
arranged on the friction material free area (29) of the backing plate anchored against 

abutments (21, 22) which are shaped to mate with the corresponding opening (17) on 
the underside of the brake caliper (5), characterised by the clamping section of the 

hold down spring (18) forming a V-shaped connection (36) on the friction material 
free area (29) of the backing plate (11, 12) with parallel arranged spring legs (37, 38) 

from which two free spring leg sections (42, 43) with a minimum of one spring coil 
(40, 41) in their transition area protrude in opposite directions toward the outside. 
Spring arrangement according to claim 1, characterised by the friction material free 
area of the backing plate (29) being equipped with an indentation to accommodate 

the V-shaped connection (36), whereby both sides of the friction material free area 
(29) around the indentation (30) are flat. 
Spring arrangement according to claim 1 or 2, characterised by the brake caliper (5) 
in the area of the abutment surfaces (21, 22, 23, 24) for the free spring legs (42, 43) 

of the hold down spring being shaped non symmetrically and that the ramp shaped 
abutment surface (22) on the run-in side of the brake disc (2) is steeper than the ramp 

shaped tangential abutment surface (24) on the run-out side, and that the tangential 
abutment surface (23) on the run-in side is spaced farther from the tangent of the 

brake disc (2) than that of the run-in side. 
Spring arrangement according to patent claims 1 to 3, characterised by the friction 
material free area (29) of the backing plate (11, 12) being equipped with a U-shaped 

radial recess (32) for the installation of a brake pad wear indicator (33) and that the 
connecting section (36) of the hold down spring (18) clamps and secures the wear 

indicator (33). 
Spring arrangement according to claim 4, characterised by the friction material free 
section (29) of the backing plate (11, 12) being equipped with an indentation in the 

area of the U-shaped recess (32) to accommodate the hold down spring (18) and wear 
indicator (33). 
Spring arrangement according to claims 4 or 5, characterised by the friction material 
free area (29) of the backing plate (11, 12) being equipped on both sides with a 

recessed clearance (31) with which the U-shaped sections (34, 35) between the 
connection area (36) and the spr
ing legs (37, 38) of the hold down spring can mate. 
Spring arrangement according to one of the above listed claims, characterised by the 
tail sections (42, 43) of the free legs (42, 43) on the hold down spring (18) being bent 

towards the connecting section (36).  
 
Spring arrangement according to one of the aforementioned claims, charaterised by 
the winding (40, 41) of the hold down spring (18) exhibiting a circular shape, 

whereby the axis of the winding closely parallels the axis of the brake disc (2). 
Spring arrangement according to claim 8, characterised by the winding (40, 41) of the 
hold down spring (18) being positioned over the friction material free area (29) of the 

brake pad backing plate (11, 12). 
Brake pad backing plate of a disc brake with a friction material free area for the 
installation of a spring arrangement according to one of the aforementioned claims, 

characterised by the U-shaped recess (32) forming a holder for the wear indicator 
(33) with hook shaped lips (32). 
Brake pad backing plate according to claim 10, characterised by the friction material 
free area on the opposite side (11) of the brake pad exhibiting a recessed surface are 

(48) for the installation of hold down spring (18) and wear indicator (33). 
Brake pad backing plate according to claim 10 or 11 with wear indicator, 
characterised by the wear indicator (33) holder being integrated into the backing plate 

as a recess (48).
