<ABSTRACT>
A muscle exerciser for exercising facial muscles, comprises jaw engaging means (2, 10, 12, 14, 18, 20, 32) movable between a compressed configuration and an expanded configuration, and adapted to be placed between the upper and lower jaws of a user so that closure of the jaws causes movement of the jaw engaging means from its expanded configuration to its compressed configuration, and biasing means (2, 10, 16, 32) for biasing the jaw engaging means towards said expanded configuration, wherein in use the facial muscles are exercised by repeatedly closing the jaws against the action of the biasing means (2, 10, 16, 32).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a muscle exerciser. There are a number of measures which can be employed 
to prevent the wrinkling of skin which tends to occur with 
age. One such method is body building, which increases the 
sizes of body muscles so that the skin covering the muscles 
is stretched more tightly and consequently gives a less 
wrinkled appearance. Wrinkles on facial skin are, however, 
conventionally treated by applying various creams, lotions 
and electrical impulses to the face, but such treatments 
are expensive, and electrical impulse treatment should only 
be performed by qualified therapists. It is known from US-A-4185817 to provide a teeth 
exerciser for exercising teeth, comprising teeth engaging 
means movable between a compressed configuration and an 
expanded configuration, and adapted to be placed between 
the upper and lower teeth of a user so that closure of the 
jaws causes movement of the teeth engaging means from its 
expanded configuration to its compressed configuration, and 
biasing means for biasing the teeth engaging means towards 
said expanded configuration, wherein in use the teeth are 
exercised by repeatedly closing the jaws against the action 
of the biasing means. This known teeth exerciser is of 
generally U-shape and is moulded in a single piece from 
durable, pliant material. It is designed to exercise all  
 
teeth of a user. A person's front teeth are only used to 
take the initial bite at food and the molars then grind and 
break down the food prior to swallowing. If the front 
teeth are used to bite against resistance too frequently, 
the nerves to the teeth will eventually be damaged. The present invention relates to a muscle exerciser 
rather than a teeth exerciser and overcomes the drawback of 
the prior art by providing jaw engaging means in the form 
of two separate biting parts one of which is adapted to be 
gripped between the left rear teeth only of the user and 
the other of which is adapted to be gripped between the 
right rear teeth only of a user. Preferably, each biting part is formed by a piece of 
resilient material, such as rubber. The resilient material may be coated with a suitable 
material, such as a plastics material, to ensure that it 
does not have an unpleasant taste, and/or to ensure that it 
can safely and hygienically be placed in the mouth. Preferably, the muscle exerciser further comprises 
a handle which is attached to the jaw engaging means so as 
to allow the user in use to hold the jaw engaging means in 
position

<CLAIMS>
A muscle exerciser for exercising facial muscles, 
comprising jaw engaging means movable between a compressed 

configuration and an expanded configuration, and adapted to 
be placed between the upper and lower jaws of a user so 

that closure of the jaws causes movement of the jaw 
engaging means from its expanded configuration to its 

compressed configuration, and biasing means for biasing the 
jaw engaging means towards said expanded configuration, 

wherein in use the facial muscles are exercised by 
repeatedly closing the jaws against the action of the 

biasing means characterised in that the jaw engaging means 
comprises two separate biting parts (22,24) one of which is 

adapted to be gripped between the left rear teeth only of 
the user and the other of which is adapted to be gripped 

between the right rear teeth only of a user. 
A muscle exerciser as claimed in claim 1, wherein 
each biting part comprises a piece of resilient material 

(32). 
A muscle exerciser as claimed in any preceding 
claim, which further comprises a handle (28) which is 

attached to the jaw engaging means so as to allow the user 
in use to hold the jaw engaging means in position between 

the upper and lower jaws.  
 
A muscle exerciser as claimed in claim 3, wherein 
the biting parts (22,24) are removable from the handle (28) 

so as to allow the biting parts to be replaced when 
necessary. 
A muscle exerciser as claimed in any preceding 
claim, wherein the separation between the two biting parts 

(22,24) is adjustable so as to allow use with different 
sized jaws. 
A method of exercising facial muscles using a muscle 
exerciser as cla
imed in any preceding claim, the method 
comprising the steps of placing the jaw engaging means of 

the muscle exerciser between the upper and lower jaws, and 
repeatedly closing the jaws against the action of the 

biasing means.
