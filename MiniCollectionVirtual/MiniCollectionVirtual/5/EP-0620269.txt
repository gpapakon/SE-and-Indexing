<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cleaning composition, 
particularly suitable for dishwashing. Commercial hand dishwashing compositions typically 
comprise, as the principal surfactant component, one or 
more surfactants selected from a relatively small group of 
components. In particular, principal surfactants are 
typically selected from amongst primary alcohol sulphates, 
secondary alkane sulphonates, linear alkyl benzene 
sulphonate, ethoxylated alcohols and alkyl ether 
sulphates. In addition to these principal surfactants it is 
commonplace for compositions to comprise a so called 
'foam-booster', selected from amine oxides, alkanolamides 
(particularly the mono and di ethanolamides and 
isopropanolamides) and other nitrogen-based surfactant 
compounds, including poly-hydroxy amides and betaines. All of these compositions can suffer from stability 
problems if formulated incorrectly, particularly at low 
temperatures. As compositions frequently comprise several 
surfactant components there is no general rule for 
determining whether a particular composition will be 
stable or not. Formulations comprising mono-ethanolamide 
are particularly difficult to stabilise at a low 
temperature.  Many compositions are known which make use, as the 
principal surfactant, of ethoxylated alcohol nonionic 
surfactants of the general formula: 
R-O-(CH₂-CH₂O)n-Hwhere R is alkyl and n is typically 5-14, or the related 
alkyl ether sulphates of the general formula: 
R-O-(CH₂-CH₂O)n-SO₃⁻where R is again alkyl and n is typically 1-5. In typical commercial formulations, some 80% of the 
surfactant system comprises ether sulphates, with the 
balance of the actives comprising one or more foam-boosters. 
The overall active concentration on product 
typically varies from around 20% for 'economy' brands to 
around 40% for 'concentrated' products. Over many years, other surfactants have been proposed for 
use in hand dishwashing formulations and in cleaning 
compositions in general. One such class are the carboxyl-terminated surfactants 
derived from fatty alcohols by interposing hydrophillic 
oxygen heteroatoms into the aliphatic chain of simple 
soaps. These molecules are of the general formula: 
R-O-(CH₂-CH₂O)n-CH₂-COOHWhere R is alkyl and n is typically 1-5. Alkyl polyethoxy carboxylates obtained via the sodium 
hydroxide adduct of an ethoxylated alcohol, subsequently 
treated with chloracetic acid have been known for over  
 
twenty years: see 'Nonionic Surfactants' by M.J. Schick
