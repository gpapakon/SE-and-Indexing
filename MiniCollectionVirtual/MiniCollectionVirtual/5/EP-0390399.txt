<ABSTRACT>
An engine starter system includes a switching-over 
circuit arrangement (5,6) for selectively connecting a 

large capacity capacitor (4) in parallel to or in series 
with a battery (3). Normally, the capacitor is connected 

parallel to the battery and charged thereby. When starting 
an engine with a starter (1), the charged capacitor is 

connected in series to the battery and the voltage of the 
capacitor and the voltage of the battery are added and 

applied to the starter to energize a starter motor for 
starting the engine.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an engine starter 
system for supplying an electric current to the starter 
mechanism for an engine to start the engine. Engines mounted on motor vehicles are usually 
started by a starter mechanism which comprises a series 
motor and a magnet switch. Electric power is supplied from 
a power supply to the starter mechanism to energize the 
motor to rotate the crankshaft of the engine, thereby starting 
the engine. If a battery of + 12 V, for example, is 
mounted as the power supply on the motor vehicle, then a 
large current of 100 A or greater is supplied from the battery 
to the starter mechanism at the time the engine is 
started. There was an attempt to employ loads or accessories 
on motor vehicles with a unified voltage specification of 12 
V while employing a starter circuit with a voltage rating of 
24 V for reducing a large current required when starting an 
engine, to half. Motor vehicles with such a 24 V starter 
circuit and 12 V accessory circuits required a plurality of 
12 V batteries to be used in combination. These combined 
12 V batteries could not be charged and discharged in a balanced 
condition, and required a more troublesome maintenance 
process and had a shorter service life than a single 12 V or  
 
24 V battery. While the motor vehicles had certain merits 
such as lower wiring and relay requirements because of the 
reduced starting current needed, they are not available in 
the market today owing to the limited battery maintenance 
and service life. When the engine on a motor vehicle is started, the 
starter mechanism consumes a very large current and the battery 
voltage drops temporarily. Therefore, sufficient 
electric power cannot be supplied to accessories such as a 
car radio, a tranceiver, etc., for a few seconds while the 
starter mechanism is in operation. One solution to this 
problem is proposed in Japanese Laid-Open Utility Model 
Publication No. 56(1981)-1466644. The proposed system comprises 
a series-connected circuit of an engine starter and a 
starter switch and another series-connected circuit of a 
unidirectional element and a large-capacity capacitor. 
These series-connected circuits are connected parallel to 
the battery. The opposite terminals of the capacitor are 
connected to accessories on the motor vehicle for supplying 
electric power from the capacitor to the accessories. The 
capacitor serves as a power supply for the accessories and 
is effective to prevent an accessory shutdown at the time of 
starting the engine.
