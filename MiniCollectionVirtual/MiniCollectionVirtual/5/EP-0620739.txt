 TITLEMethod of Treating TNF-Dependent Inflammation Using Tumor Necrosis FactorAntagonistsCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONSThis application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application Serial No. 523,635, filed May 10, 1990, now pending, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application Serial No. 421,417, filed October 13, 1989, now abandoned, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application Serial No. 405,370, filed September 11, 1989, now abandoned, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application Serial No. 403,241, filed September 5, 1989, now abandoned.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates generally to cytokine receptors and more specifically to a method of using tumor necrosis factor antagonists to suppress TNF- dependent inflammatory diseases.Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα, also known as cachectin) and tumor necrosis factor-β (TNFβ, also known as lymphotoxin) are homologous mammalian endogenous secretory proteins capable of inducing a wide variety of effects on a large number of cell types. The great similarities in the structural and functional characteristics of these two cytokines have resulted in their collective description as "TNF." Complementary cDNA clones encoding TNFα (Pennica et al., Nature 312:124, 1984) and TNFβ (Gray et al., Nature 312:121, 1984) have been isolated, permitting further structural and biological characterization of TNF.TNF proteins initiate their biological effect on cells by binding to specific TNF receptor (TNFR^ proteins expressed on the plasma membrane of a TNF-responsive cell. Two distinct forms of TNFR are known to exist: Type I TNFR (TNFRI), having a molecular weight of approximately 75 kilodaltons, and Type II TNFR (TNFRII), having a molecular weight of approximately 55 kilodaltons. TNFRI and TNFRII each bind to both TNFα and TNFβ. TNFRI and TNFRII have both been molecularly cloned (Smith et al., Science 248:1019, 1990; Loetscher et al., Cell 67:351, 1990 and Schall et al., Cell 61:361, 1990), permitting recombinant expression and purification of soluble TNFR proteins. Soluble TNF binding proteins from human urine have also been identified(Peetre et al., Ewr. J. Haematol. 41:414, 1988; Seckinger et al., J. Exp. Med. 767:1511, 1988; Seckinger et al., J. Biol. Chem. 264:11966, 1989; UK Patent 

Application, Publ. No. 2 218 101 A to Seckinger et al.; Engelmann et al., J. Biol. Chem. 264:1191 , 1989).TNF antagonists, such as soluble TNFR and TNF binding proteins, bind to TNF and prevent TNF from binding to cell membrane bound TNF

 CLAIMS
We claim:
1. A method for treating TNF-mediated inflammatory diseases which comprises administering to a mammal in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of a TNF antagonist.
2. A method according to claim 1, wherein the TNF-mediated inflammatory disease is arthritis.
3. A method according to claim 2, wherein the mammal is a human.
4. A method according to claim 3, wherein the TNF antagonist is soluble human TNFR.
5. A method according to claim 4, wherein the soluble human TNFR is selected from the group consisting of soluble human Type I TNFR and soluble human Type π TNFR.
6. A method according to claim 4, wherein the soluble human TNFR is fused to the Fc region of a human immunoglobulin molecule.
7. A method according to claim 2, wherein TNFR is administered in combination with IL-IR.
8. A method for treating arthritis in a mammal, comprising the step of administering to a mammal having arthritis an amount of soluble human TNFR ranging from about 0.1 mg/kg/week to about 100 mg/kg/week.
9. A method according to claim 8, wherein the amount of soluble human TNFR ranges from about 0.5 mg/kg/week to about 50 mg/kg/week.
