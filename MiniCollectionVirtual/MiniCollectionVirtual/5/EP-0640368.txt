<ABSTRACT>
A purification method and apparatus for 
creating ultra-purity chemicals for semiconductor 

processing. The purification method includes a step of 
expanding an ESG chemical through an orifice (17) inside 

a condenser (21) to a partial condensed state for 
removing impurities from ESG chemical. During the 

expansion step, the higher boiling point impurities 
remain in the liquid phase and the impurities in the 

vapor phase are removed at least in part by a scavenging 
technique. After purification, the ultra-purified gas 

is transferred to a semiconductor manufacturing 
operation (24). The manufacturing operation includes 

both dry and wet processes. The method may also be 
integr
ated into a large volume on-site purification 
system, on-line point of use purifier, or 

small volume trans-filling purification system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and
apparatus for the ultra-purification of chemicals for
semiconductor processing. In particular, the present
invention provides a purification process where a
compressed fluid is partially condensed by expanding the
fluid through an orifice or any other expansion means
such as a capillary or the like.In the manufacture of semiconductor devices,
the industry requires high purity chemicals to avoid the
introduction of defects into the device during various
processing steps. Such processing steps include, among
others, plasma etching, wet etching, and the like. The
presence of impurities in the processing chemicals used
in these processes often cause defects. In processing
chemicals such as hydrochloric acid (HCl), chlorine gas
(Cl2), nitrogen trifluoride (NF3), or the like, the
impurities include metal contaminants (eg., Fe, Ni, Cr,
Cu, Al, Mn, Zn, etc.), moisture (eg., H20), carbon
dioxide (eg. CO2), and the like.In ESG HCl, the predominant impurities are
typically iron and moisture. When geometrically large
enough, the impurities can, for example, short-out
adjacent active structures within a device, and thus
cause lower wafer yields (or die per wafer). Such
impurities are known in the art as "particles." In 
addition, if the impurities are charged, the charged
impurities are generally detrimental to the electrical
characteristics of the device. Moreover, the impurities
can also be corrosive to the device structure. As line
widths for the state-of-art device become smaller
(typically sub-micron), the industry demands high purity
chemicals having lower impurity levels. In addition to
the manufacture of semiconductors, the optical,
aerospace, pharmaceutical industries, and the like also
require high purity chemicals.In the past, the semiconductor industry often
used electronic semiconductor grade chemicals supplied
in bottles. The bottles contain high purity chemicals
also called electronic semiconductor grade (ESG)
chemicals having purity levels of about 99.99% by weight
or "four nine" purity. The bottles are also typically
about 20 liters or less in size. However, the
electronics industry is currently switching to chemicals
in bulk on-site supplies. The use of ESG chemicals in
bulk provides the manufacturer with lower chemical costs
because bulk chemicals require less handling and have a
lower cost per unit than bottled chemicals.However, the change to bulk on-site supplies
within the industry is not free from problems. For
example, electronic semiconductor
