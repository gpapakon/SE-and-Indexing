<ABSTRACT>
A rear focus type zoom lens including four sections 
respectively constituted by an objective lens (51), a magnification 

varying lens (52), a transmission lens (54) and an image focusing lens (55) 
arranged in this order such that the objective lens is 

disposed at the frontmost position, the zoom lens further 
including a beam splitter (56) disposed between a rearmost lens 

component of the image focusing lens and an image focusing 
surface (57) and adapted to separate a part of light incident 

thereon so that an optical view finder system is integral with 
an image pickup system. This construction makes it possible 

to prevent a parallax occurring in a case including a separate 
view finder. Since the overall construction of the zoom lens 

is common to the view finder, no separate objective lens is 
required in the view finder system. The zoom lens enables 

compactness and lightness of the optical view finder system 
because it is of the rear focus type, as compared to those of 

the existing front focus type. In particular, the rear focus 
type zoom lens makes it possible to view a clear image even at 

a bright place because light adjusted in amount by the iris (53) is 
incident on the viewer's eye.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a rear focus type zoom 
lens, and more particularly to a rear focus type zoom lens 
including an optical view finder of a through the lens (TTL) 
system, which the optical view finder is integral with the 
zoom lens. Conventional optical view finders are classified, in 
terms of constitution, into those of a view finder system 
constructed separately from an image pickup system and those 
of a view finder system integral with the image pickup system. Such optical view finder systems are partially disclosed 
in U.S. Patent No. 4,544, 250 "Optical System for Camera with 
a View Finder" and the handbook "Camera Technique" issued by 
Japanese Photograph Industrial Technique Company, Limited. The optical view finder including the view finder system 
constructed separately from the image pickup system is of two 
types one being the optical real image type and the other 
being the optical virtual image type. FIG. 1 shows a  
 
construction of the optical real image type view finder, while 
FIGS. 2A and 2B show an functional effect of the optical real 
image type view finder, respectively. As shown in FIG. 1, the optical real image type view 
finder includes an objective lens 1 disposed at the frontmost 
position on an optical axis of the view finder. The objective 
lens 1 is followed by a magnification varying lens 2 which is 
composed of lens elements having positive or negative 
refractive indexes to obtain a predetermined variable 
magnification. A transmission lens 3 composed of lens 
elements having positive or negative refractive indexes is 
disposed behind the magnification varying lens 2 and spaced a 
predetermined distance apart from the magnification varying 
lens 2. The transmission lens 3 serves to transmit an image 
from the magnification varying lens 2 incident thereon by its 
function. An eyepiece 4 is arranged behind the transmission 
lens 3 and composed of lens elements having positive 
refractive indexes. As shown in FIG. 2A, the objective lens 1 refracts light 
indicative of an image of an object 5 positioned at an 
optional position so that the image of the object 5 may be 
transmitted to the interior of a barrel in which the 
constituting elements of the view finder are arranged. The 
image from the objective lens 5 is transmitted to the 
magnification varying lens 2 which, in turn, moves depending  
 
on a variation in the focus lens of the image pickup system, 
thereby producing an inversely-erected real image 5'. The 
inversely-erected image 5' obtained
