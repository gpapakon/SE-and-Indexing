<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an element of a photovoltaic solar cell having at least one elongated electrode which is in the form of a bar, wire (or filament) or strip, has at least one photovoltaically active coating on its surface, and is characterised in that the electrode consists of an electrically conductive material, especially impure silicon having polycrystalline, preferably monocrystalline structure, and the coating consists of a monocrystalline or polycrystalline photovoltaically active material, especially silicon having a defined doping (p-doping or n-doping), on the surface of the electrode, which material is, for example, continuously applied by means of a wire extrusion die.
