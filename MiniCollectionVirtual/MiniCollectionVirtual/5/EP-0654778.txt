<ABSTRACT>
A method of displaying texts and graphics on a visual display device which has a screen raster with a predetermined number of pixels in the x-direction and the y-direction and an image repetition memory, the characters to be represented being loaded in contour format from a memory and the raster points (pixels) lying on the contour of each character being determined by means of a raster method (grid walk). In order to achieve a better image quality, a grey representation of the characters is performed by scanning and calculating the character positions one character after the other for the individual characters in a fine raster in which the screen raster is subdivided in the x-direction in m and in the y-direction in n fine-raster pixels (m, n 
>
 1), and by converting each individual character in the fine raster into a run length or bit mapping coding of its outer contour and by combining the respectively m x n fine-raster pixels in each screen-raster pixel of each character by adding their bit values and by assigning the screen-raster pixel a grey value which is a function of the sum, and which is written into the image repetition memory which has a resolution in bits (bit scaling) of at least the number of provided grey values (quarter-byte, half-byte, byte-map memory).

A method for displaying text and graphics on a display device
which comprises a display screen raster with a given

number of pixels in x and y direction and a video refresh
memory, wherein the glyphs, for example characters and similar

graphic symbols, to be displayed are loaded in an
outline format from a memory, are scaled, rotated and

positioned according to the text processing requirements and
wherein the raster points lying on the outline of each glyph

are determined by a rasterisation process, e.g. a gridwalk,

wherein rasterisation and positioning of the glyphs is done
glyph by glyph in a fine raster in which each pixel of the

display screen raster is subdivided in x direction into m
and in y direction into n fine raster pixels, wherein m, n

are natural numbers larger than 1, and wherein each glyph is
transformed into a run length code of its outline in which

in each fine raster line the start raster position of each
stroke in x-direction consisting of at least one filled

pixel and the difference between end and start raster position
of the stroke are given, and
wherein the m × n fine raster pixels in each screen display
pixel of each glyph are summed by adding their bit-values by

direct calculation from the run length code, and a grey
value depending on the sum is allocated to said screen display

raster pixel and is written into the video refresh
memory which has a bit depth of at least the number of provided

grey-values, for example a quarterbyte-, halfbyte- or
byte-map memory.
A method according to Claim 1, wherein m×n+1 steps of grey-values
are used from black to white and wherein the grey-value

of a display screen raster pixel is represented by the
sum of the bit-values of the fine raster. 
A method according to any of the preceeding claims, wherein
the determined grey-value of a display screen raster pixel

is written into the video refresh memory by adding it to the
content of the memory location corresponding to this display

screen raster pixel in the video refresh memory.
Method according to any of the preceeding claims, wherein
the rasterisation is performed in the fine raster without

performing an intelligent rasterisation method utilizing the
instructions of the outlined format.
Method according to any of the preceeding claims, wherein
for the fine raster m=8 and n=4 is chosen.
Method according to any of the claims 1 to 4, wherein for
the fine raster m=4 and n=4 is chosen.
A method according to any of the preceeding claims, wherein,
when using a colour display screen, the grey steps are generated

by uniform excitation of the red, yellow and blue colour
centers.
A method for displaying text and graphics on a display
device which comprises a display screen raster with a given

number of pixels in x and y direction and a video refresh
memory, wherein the glyphs, for example characters and similar

graphic symbols, to be displayed are loaded in an
outline format from a memory, are scaled, rotated and

positioned according to the text processing requirements and
wherein the raster points lying on the outline of each glyph

are determined by a rasterisation process, e.g. a gridwalk,

wherein before the begin of a text display all glyphs of a
script selected by the user are rastered in a fine raster

only once which is in x direction m times and in y direction
n times finer than the display screen raster, wherein m, n 

are natural numbers larger than 1, and wherein each glyph is
transformed into a run length code of its outline, in which

in each fine raster line the start raster position of each
stroke in x-direction consisting of at least one filled

pixel and the difference between end and start raster position
of the stroke are given, and is stored in an

intermediate storage,
wherein for text display the fine rastered glyphs are
recalled from the intermediate storage according to the text

processing requirements and are, according to their position
in the text, transferred to a corresponding fine raster

position in the display screeen raster,
wherein the m × n fine raster pixels in each screen display
pixel of each glyph are summed by adding their bit-values by

direct calculation from the run length code, and a grey
value depending on the sum is allocated to said screen display

raster pixel and is written into the video refresh
memory which has a bit depth of at least the number of provided

grey-values, for example a quarterbyte-, halfbyte- or
byte-map memory.
A method according to Claim 8, wherein the determined grey-value
of a display screen raster pixel is written into the

video refresh memory by adding it to the content to the
memory location corresponding to this display screen raster

pixel in the video refresh memory.
