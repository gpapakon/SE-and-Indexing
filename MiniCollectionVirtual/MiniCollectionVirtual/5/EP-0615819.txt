<ABSTRACT>
This protector is of the type composed of a metal sleeve (7) comprising a section enveloping the upper end of the handle (3) and a section engaging into the biconical eye, of elliptical or oblong section, of the head (2) and exhibiting, on the handle side, a lower frustoconical part (9a) which matches the internal shape of the eye. According to the invention, the section of the protector engaging into the biconical eye extends over the entire length of the eye and includes, in the extension of its lower conical part (9a) matching the internal shape of the conical part (5a) of the eye pointing towards the handle, an upper conical part (9'b) of opposite conicity to the lower conical part (9a) matching the upper conical part (5b) of the eye and interacting with this conical part in order to ensure two-way immobilisation in terms of translation within the head (2) of the tool. The method essentially consists in inserting into the eye a blank of the sleeve, including a straight neck, and in deforming the end of this blank using a punch in order to give it a conical shape which matches that of the part (5b) of the eye.
