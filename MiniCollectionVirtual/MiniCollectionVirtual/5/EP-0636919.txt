<ABSTRACT>
A liquid crystal display apparatus of the 
invention includes a pair of substrates (31,32) and a liquid 

crystal layer (33) sandwiched between the pair of substrates with 
alignment films (31b,32b) formed at interfaces between the 

liquid crystal layer and the respective substrates. 
The alignment films regulate aligning conditions of 

liquid crystal in the liquid crystal layer. In the 
liquid crystal display apparatus, the liquid crystal 

layer includes two or more liquid crystal layer regions 
of different aligning conditions, and at least one of 

the alignment films has surface tensions, or oxygen atom concentrations 
or carbonyl radical concentrations, which are 

different from each other in surface regions thereof 
corresponding to the respective liquid crystal layer 

regions of different aligning conditions. 
For example, the alignment film is selectively irradiated with light 

(35) through a mask (11) while a gas including at least one of oxygen 
and ozone is in contact with the alignment film.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid
crystal display apparatus with a wide viewing angle and
a method for producing the same.In a liquid crystal display (LCD), a liquid
crystal layer including liquid crystal molecules is
provided between a pair of substrates. When the alignment
of the liquid crystal molecules is changed, the
optical refractive index of the liquid crystal layer is
also changed. By utilizing the change in the refractive
index, the LCD performs the display. Accordingly,
it is important that the liquid crystal molecules are
arranged as regularly as possible in the initial state.
In order to arrange for the regularity of the liquid
crystal molecules in the initial state, the surface
conditions of the substrates which sandwich the liquid
crystal layer should regulate the interactions between
the liquid crystal molecules and the surfaces.In the method for performing such a regulation
which is currently the most widely used, materials
for liquid crystal alignment films are applied to each
of the surfaces of the substrates which face the liquid
crystal layer. The applied materials are dried and
cured, so as to form the alignment film. Thereafter,
the surface of the alignment film is rubbed. When a
liquid crystal layer is provided between the substrates
having such rubbed alignment films, liquid crystal
molecules which are in contact with the alignment films 
are aligned along the rubbing direction.There are two types of alignment films for
regulating the alignment of the liquid crystal, i.e.,
an inorganic alignment film and an organic alignment
film. Materials for the inorganic alignment film
include oxides, inorganic silane, metals, and metal
complexes, whereas materials for the organic alignment
film include polyimides. A typical material for the
liquid crystal alignment film which is currently employed
is polyimide resin. The polyimide resin is
produced in the following manner. A polyamic acid,
which is a precursor for all aromatic polyimides (all
aromatic PI), is first applied to a substrate. Then,
the substrate with the polyamic acid is heated so that
an imidization reaction occurs. As a result, the
polyamic acid is converted into a polyimide resin. The
reasons why the polyimide resin is widely used for the
liquid crystal alignment film material are the concentration
and the viscosity thereof can easily be adjusted
since the polyamic acid has a good solubility, the
polyimide resin has a good applicability, and the
thickness of the polyimide resin film can be easily
controlled. The
