Reaction chamber (10) of a mobile arrangement, which reaction 
chamber is of elongate construction and is arranged to be 

mounted on a chassis, for the continuous B- and/or C-decontamination 
of articles of clothing and/or equipment using 

a mixture of at least hot air and water vapour, comprising 

a) a reaction path (11) which is tunnel-like and in cross-section 
is fully closed and which is arranged in the 

longitudinal direction of the reaction chamber (10) as 

a single track or 
a plurality of tracks in the form of subsections 
(11a, 11b) ranged side by side; 
b) a conveyor system having a guide rail (18) running along 
the reaction path and along which containers (19) for 

receiving the articles are movable; 
c) an entry door (16) at the start of the reaction path 
(11) for admission of the containers (19) charged with 

contaminated articles; 
d) an exit door (17) at the end of the reaction path (11) 
for discharge of the containers (19) charged with the 

decontaminated articles; 
e) a gas supply and gas discharge system for the hot gas 
mixture, which system acts on the movable containers 

(19), having 

e1) at least one supply (41), which is arranged to be 
connected to a hot gas generator (32), and at 

least one extraction fan (42) for conveying used 
gas by way of an outlet into the open air. 
characterised in that
gas-permeable baskets (19) are used as containers for 
the articles to be decontaminated; 
the entire decontamination path (11) or the subsections 
(11a, 11b) thereof is/are located between the supply or 

supplies (41) and the extraction fan or fans (42) in 
order to generate a longitudinal flow of gas (40) which 

at least in the last subsection (11b) of the reaction 
path (11) flows in the opposite direction to the 

conveying direction (12) of the baskets (19); 
several cross-flow fans (51) having gas-deflecting 
elements are arranged along the reaction path (11) to 

generate a cross-flow of gas (50) guided in a 
circulatory movement and running transversely to the 

reaction path. 
Reaction chamber according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 
the cross-flow fans (51) and the associated operating units 

(52) are arranged on the roof of the reaction chamber (10). 
Reaction chamber according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in 
that
 the gas-deflecting elements comprise perforated plates 
(53) for guiding the hot gas mixture. 
Reaction chamber according to claim 3, 
characterised in that
 
the perforated plates (53) are arranged along a side of the 

reaction path (11) and that in operation the cross-flow fans 
(51) blow the hot gas mixture through these perforated plates 

(53). 
Reaction chamber according to any one of claims 1 to 4, 

characterised in that
a) the reaction path (11) is two-track and consists of a 
first and a second subsection (11a, 11b) and therefore 


a1) the first and the second subsection (11a, 11b) are 
ranged side by side at a first end face (14) of 

the reaction chamber (10); 
a2) the beginning and the end of the reaction path 
(11), respectively the entry and exit doors (16, 

17), are arranged at the second end face (15); 
b) the supplies (41) for the hot gas mixture discharge at 
the second end face (15) both at the beginning and at 

the end of the reaction path (11) and an extraction fan 
(42) for both subsections (11a, 11b) is arranged at the 

first end face (14), so that the longitudinal gas flow 
(40) developing in the first subsection (11a) runs in 

the same direction as and the longitudinal gas flow 
developing in the second subsection (11b) flows in the 

opposite direction from the conveying direction (12) of 
the baskets (19). 
Reaction chamber according to any one of claims 1 to 5, 

characterised by
 the following features for 
A-decontamination: 


a) spray frames with nozzles for spraying on a 
decontamination solution are arranged in a first section 

of the reaction path (11). 
b) spray frames with nozzles for washing out the 
decontamination solution with a rinsing solution are 

arranged in a following section of the reaction path 
(11); 
c) fans for drying with hot air are arranged in a last 
section of the reaction path (11).
