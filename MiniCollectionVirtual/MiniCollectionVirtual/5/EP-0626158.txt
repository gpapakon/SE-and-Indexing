<ABSTRACT>
An absorbent article, particularly a sanitary napkin comprises a 
liquid pervious topsheet (12), a liquid impervious backsheet (14) and an 

absorbent core (16,18) interposed between the topsheet (12) and the 
backsheet (14). The core comprises a longitudinal center line and two 

edges. At least one liquid directing barrier structure 
(34,36,38,40,42,46,48) is applied to the core and/or the topsheet on 

either side of the longitudinal center line (28) thereof between the 
center line and the longitudinal edges (30,32).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an absorbent article, particularly a sanitary 
napkin comprising a liquid pervious topsheet, a liquid impervious 
backsheet and an absorbent core interposed between the topsheet 
and the backsheet, the core comprising a longitudinal center line 
and two lateral edges. Absorbent articles of this kind are well-known in the art. These articles, 
e.g. sanitary napkins, incontinence products or the like, usually 
have an elongated form with a length-to-width ratio of approximately 
3:1. Since the distribution of a liquid applied to the central 
zone of the napkin will be approximately circular, the liquid will 
reach the lateral edges of the absorbent core comparatively soon 
while the suction and liquid storing capacity of the longitudinal end 
portions of the core cannot be used. Thus, particularly in narrow 
absorbent articles and/or those having a small caliper, a too large 
lateral migration of liquids can lead to undesired soiling of the 
sides of the article. The US patent US-A 5 009 653 discloses a sanitary napkin having 
an absorbent core formed of a layer of hydrogel material interposed 
between two layers of an air-laid tissue sheet. The core is covered 
by a wet-laid tissue which serves to improve wicking of the discharged 
body liquids over the core so that a more efficient use of 
the hydrogel material is made. Thus liquid migration in the longitudinal 
direction of the sanitary napkin is improved, but lateral migration  
 
also occurs and thus soiling of the sides of the napkin remains 
possible. The EP-A 0 400 694 teaches to coat a marginal portion of a nonwoven 
liquid pervious topsheet of an absorbent article by hot melt 
adhesive to deposit a liquid impermeable film thereon. In connection 
with babies diapers, it is known from the US-A 4 795 454 to 
provide longitudinal barrier cuffs surrounding the leg of a baby and 
seal lines connecting the barrier cuffs to the backsheet or the topsheet 
to avoid a lateral escape of body liquids between the backsheets 
and the barrier cuffs. By laterally sealing an absorbent article, 
it will be possible to prevent leakage at the longitudinal edges 
of an absorbent article to some extent, depending on the liquid 
storing capacity of the edge portions of the absorbent core. However, 
the possibility to increase the storing capacity of the edge 
portions by increasing the concentration of superabsorbent gel is 
limited because of the so-called "gel blocking effect". Moreover, the 
longitudinal liquid distribution is not
