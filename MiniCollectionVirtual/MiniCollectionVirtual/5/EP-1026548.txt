<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical member for
photolithography made of a calcium fluoride crystal, and
a photolithography apparatus using this optical member; and,
more specifically, to an optical member made of a calcium
fluoride crystal which is employed in a stepper or scanner
which is a photolithography apparatus using, for its
exposure light source, an F2 laser (157 nm), an ArCl excimer
laser (175 nm), a Kr2 excimer laser (146 nm), an Ar2 excimer
laser (126 nm), a solid-state laser utilizing a nonlinear
optical effect, or other ultraviolet rays, and a
photolithography apparatus using this optical member.In recent VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration), density
and function have become higher, thus requiring finer
processing techniques on a wafer. As a method of its
processing, one based on photolithography is carried out
in general. At present, the exposure wavelength is becoming
shorter, and a stepper using ArF excimer laser light (having
a wavelength of 193 nm) is expected to appear soon. Since
typical optical materials absorb light having a wavelength
not longer than 193 nm, materials employable in optical 
members for photolithography are quite limited. While
specific examples thereof include lithium fluoride crystals,
magnesium fluoride crystals, calcium fluoride crystals,
barium fluoride crystals, strontium fluoride crystals, and
silica glass, optical members are often designed by use of
two kinds of materials constituted by a calcium fluoride
crystal and silica glass in general.Also, attempts are being made to further shorten the
wavelength of the light source in order to effect finer
processing, and demands for photolithography utilizing
vacuum ultraviolet rays such as F2 laser light (having a
wavelength of 157 nm) have been increasing in recent years.
Since silica glass exhibits a low transmission property with
respect to such light, however, it is not considered to be
suitably usable as the material for optical members.
Therefore, optical members made of calcium fluoride
crystals have been under development.Conventionally, calcium fluoride crystals have been
made by such methods as Bridgman-Stockbarger method
(crucible descending method), Czochralski method, and the
like. Among others, Bridgman-Stockbarger method is in wide
use since it is advantageous in that crystal growth is
carried out while being kept from contamination from the
air and in that it can make a large crystal. In this method,
a fluorinating agent (e.g., lead fluoride or the like) known
as scavenger is added to

internal transmittance of 99.5%/cm or greater with respect
to light having a specific wavelength of 185 nm or shorter.

a step of cutting out a measurement sample having a
thickness of 30 mm or greater from an optical member made

of a calcium fluoride crystal;
a step of measuring a transmittance of said
measurement sample at a specific wavelength of 185 nm or

shorter; and
a step of excluding an influence of decrease in said
