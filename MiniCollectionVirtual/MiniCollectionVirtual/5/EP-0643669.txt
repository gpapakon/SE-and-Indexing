<DESCRIPTION>
 ZINC PHOSPHOROUS OXIDE AND ZINC ARSENIC OXIDE COMPOSITIONSFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe invention relates to novel compositions of matter and methods for making them. More particularly, the invention relates to new compositions of matter that are structurally similar to zeolites and which contain zinc in an oxide framework that includes phosphorus or arsenic.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONStructured, microporous oxides are utilized in a multitude of catalytic and sorption/separation processes in the petroleum and petrochemical industry. The most widely known group of materials falling in this category are the alu inosilicate zeolites. See Breck, D.W., "Zeolite Molecular Sieves", Wiley, New York, 1984.Recently, new microporous materials, such as aluminophos- phates, silicoaluminophosphates and metalloaluminophosphates, have been synthesized using an organic templating species. See, Wilson et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. Vol. 104, p. 1147, 1982; Lok et a . , U.S. Patent 4,440,871; and Lok et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. Vol. 106, p. 6092, 1984. These materials demonstrate two very important factors concerning the synthesis of molecular sieves: (a) that three- dimensional microporous materials can be crystallized from highly acidic reaction media and (b) that sometimes components other than silicon and aluminum will generate porous oxide frameworks. In the case of zinc phosphate phases, however, porous oxide frameworks have not, until now, been generated.For example, structural studies have been carried out on the zinc phosphate phase (H3θ)Zn θ4. See, Sandomirskii et al . , Dokl . Akad. Nauk SSSR, Vol. 236(3), pp. 597-600, 1977 and Averbuch-Pouchot, Acta. Crvst., Vol. B35, pp. 1452-1454,' 1979. Similar studies have 

 been conducted for other zinc phosphate phases; see Kabalov et al., Dokl. Akad. Nauk SSSR, Vol. 202(4), pp. 823-826, 1972; Averbuch- ' Pouchot et al., Acta. Crvst., Vol. C39, pp. 25-26, 1983; Averbuch- Pouchot, Zeitschrift Fur Kristalloqraphic, Vol. 171, pp. 113-119, 1985. These zinc phosphate phases all lack any substantial porosity. One indication of this is that these materials are not hydroxylated nor do they contain sorbed water.It is an object of the present invention, therefore, to make new microporous oxides of zinc and phosphorous or arsenic.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONBriefly stated, this present invention passes a new .class of microporous zinc phosphorous oxide and zinc arsenic oxide compositions and method of preparation. The novel compositions have an oxide framework containing zinc and an oxide
