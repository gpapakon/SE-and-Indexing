<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a brew house installation having at least two wort (boiling) coppers (WPF1, WPF2) which are connected to the vapour compression unit (3) via copper-steam pipes. In order to simplify such a brew house installation with respect to construction expense, according to the invention it is provided that two pipe sections (4, 5) of the copper-steam pipes, each leading away from one wort copper, are connected to a collective changeover device (6) which, depending on the switch position, connects one of the two wort coppers to the vapour compression unit (3).

<CLAIMS>
Brewing unit with at least two wort vessels
which are connected to a vapour condensation system via

vessel fume pipes, characterized in that two pipe
sections (4, 5), which in each case lead away from a

wort vessel (WPF2, WPF1), are connected to a common
change-over device (6) which, depending on the

switching position, connects one of the two wort
vessels to the vapour condensation system (3) or to a

pipe section (16) which is itself in turn connected to
a change-over device (6c).
Brewing unit according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the change-over device is

designed as a flap box with two inlet connections (7,
7a, 7b, 7c; 8, 8a, 8b, 8c) and two outlet connections

(9, 9a, 9b, 9c; 10, 10a, 10b, 10c).
Brewing unit according to Claim 2,
characterized in that a switching flap (11) rotable

about an axis is arranged as a two-way flap in the flap
box.
Brewing unit according to Claim 2 or 3,
characterized in that the two wort vessels (1, 2) are

connected to the two inlets (7, 8) and the flue (12) or
the connecting pipe (13) to the vapour condenser (3) is

connected to the outlet connections (9, 10).
Brewing unit according to Claim 1,
characterized in that a water lock is arranged parallel

to the change-over device.
Brewing unit according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that, in a unit with four wort

vessels (WPF1 to WPF4), in each case two wort vessels
(WPF1, WPF2; and WPF3, WPF4) are connected to a common

change-over device (6a, 6b), and in that the two vapour
condenser outlet connections (9a, 9b) of each

change-over device (6a, 6b) are connected to the inlet
connections (7c, 8c) of a third change-over device

(6c). 
Brewing unit according to Claim 6,
characterized in that a water lock (14) is arranged

parallel to the three change-over devices (6a, 6b, 6c).
