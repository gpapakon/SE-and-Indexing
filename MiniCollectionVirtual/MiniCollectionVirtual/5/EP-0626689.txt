<ABSTRACT>
Karaoke reproducing apparatus has a memory (13) in 
which is recorded information on each of the music pieces 

recorded on the compact discs (5). When a music piece is 
selected, its title is displayed on screen 22 so that the 

user can ensure the correct track was chosen. A search 
can also be carried out to select music according to 

various critereon, such as mood, themes, type of music, 
date of composition, etc. Control set data and real time 

data may be recorded on the discs (5) for respectively 
setting up external apparatus and controlling the 

external apparatus during playing of a piece of music. 
The external apparatus may comprise illumination 

apparatus (25), background video apparatus (26) and audio 
processing apparatus (27). Converting apparatus (30-32) 

may be provided to receive the control set and real-time 
data from a data separating circuit (6) and to convert 

this data according to tables stored therein to 
appropriate control data for the external circuits (25-27). 

Character data on the discs (5) for producing text 
on the display (22) may comprise a header section 

containing enlargement ratios and a character section 
containing basic character data which is acted on in 

accordance with the enlargement ratios to produce a 
desired display character, thereby saving space on the 

disc.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a recording medium
reproducing apparatus which has a recording medium on
which e.g. karaoke playing sounds of a plurality of
music pieces have been recorded and which is used to
reproduce the playing sounds of selected one of the
plurality of music pieces.Karaoke reproducing apparatuses are generally
designed that a music piece selection number (music
piece code) which is predetermined for each music piece
is input by a key operation when the user selects a
desired music piece from a plurality of karaoke music
pieces. After the music piece selection number has been
input as mentioned above, when the playing order of the
desired music piece comes, the karaoke playing sound of
the music piece corresponding to the music piece
selection number is generated from the karaoke
reproducing apparatus.In conventional karaoke reproducing apparatuses,
some apparatuses are devised to display the music piece
selection number which has been input by the key
operation so as to allow the user to confirm whether or
not the key operation by the user has been correctly
executed. However, when the key operation is performed
by a user who has mistaken the correspondence between
the desired music piece and the music piece selection
number, the user will not notice such a mistake when
seeing only the display of the music piece selection
number. This will result that the desired music piece
is not actually outputted from the karaoke reproducing
apparatus as a playing sound, after the lapse of a long
waiting time.Furthermore, when selecting a music piece, the user
cannot select the music piece unless he knows at least a 
music title name or a singer name of the music piece
which he wants to sing.JP-A-4011288 discloses a karaoke player in which
music information read from a disc is displayed on a
screen to allow a user to choose a music piece by
inputting a code from a menu displayed on the screen.
EP-A-465246 also discloses a karaoke player in which a
menu read from information on a disc is displayed on a
screen to allow for selection of a music piece.
JP-A-3120686 describes a karaoke music selection device.It is the first object of the present invention to
provide a recording medium reproducing apparatus which
can easily discriminate whether a music piece selected
by the user could be correctly accepted or not.The second object of the invention is to provide a
recording medium reproducing apparatus which can select
a desired music piece even if the user doesn't know a
music title name, a singer
