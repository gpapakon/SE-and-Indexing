<DESCRIPTION>
 COUPLING CIRCUITBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to circuits for connecting the output terminals of a signal source across a load impedance.The operation of many electrical and electronic systems relies on the application of a voltage across a load from a voltage source and it is recognized in the art that the performance of such systems depends on the quality of the coupling between the source and the load, i.e. the extent to which the voltage across the load corresponds to, or equals, the open circuit source voltage or an amplified version of the source voltage. Ideal coupling would result in the appearance of a voltage, or possibly a current, exactly proportional to the open circuit source voltage across the load with respect to both time and frequency domain characteristics as the source signal. The achievement of ideal coupling would be advantageous in many electronics systems. For example, if the signal source is an electronic or electrical circuit port, the load is an oscilloscope employed to monitor the time domain waveform of the voltage developed by the signal source and the intervening coupling medium is the oscilloscope probe and associated cabling, the oscilloscope trace will accurately reflect the waveform of the source voltage only if the voltage applied to the oscilloscope inputs is identical to the open circuit source voltage.For many other types of electronics purposes, ideal coupling would produce optimum results. This would also be the case in a variety of audio, data transmission, communication and telecommunication systems. However, there is no known circuit 

 Known coupling circuits fail to achieve ideal coupling for several reasons. Firstly, the voltage source is connected to the load via a coupling medium which has a finite impedance at any given frequency, and which will therefore be responsible for a voltage drop. Secondly, a practical voltage source behaves like an ideal voltage source in series with a source impedance. Therefore, when current is drawn from such a source, there is a voltage drop across the source resistance.It is known to minimize source-to-load voltage drops, or signal attenuation, by the provision of an active circuit, known as an amplifier stage, between the source, and load circuits. When such a circuit is used, for example when an operational amplifier is used as a unity gain voltage follower, the ratio of load voltage, VL, to source voltage, V;, can be expressed as follows:*i -W+ zÎ› zL + Ron) U>Where Av is the open circuit
