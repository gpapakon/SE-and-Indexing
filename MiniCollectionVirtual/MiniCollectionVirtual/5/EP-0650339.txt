<ABSTRACT>
A slide mechanism for a drawer is designed to save construction materials and thus also reduce weight. In this slide mechanism as per the invention the guide rail (12) has a uniform cross section and angular design. The facing open-edge sections curve inward to form telescopic-type ball bearing travellers designed for a set of three balls. To keep the overall height small, facing edges of the pull-out rail (11) and guide rail (12) can overlap. The slide mechanism as per the invention is especially well-suited for drawers in furniture.

<CLAIMS>
An extension guide for a drawer comprising a guide rail which 
can be fixed to the body of the article of furniture and an extension 

rail which can he fixed to the drawer, and an inner shaped rail which 
is provided with a plurality of ball guides and which connects the 

guide rail to the extension rail, wherein the halls are arranged 
rollably in sets and between the two outside surfaces of the inner 

shaped rail and the inside surfaces of the guide rail and the 
extension rail, characterised in that the guide rail (12) and the 

extension rail (11) are of an angular configuration in cross-section, 
wherein the two free edge regions which face away from each other, to 

form hall guides, each extend in a respective inwardly directed arc so 
that each three halls form an ball set. 
An extension guide according to claim 1 characterised in that 
the extension rail (11) and the guide rail (12) are of the same cross-section. 
An extension guide according to claim 1 characterised in that 
the mutually facing edges of the extension rail (11) and the guide 

rail (12) overlap each other. 
An extension guide according to claim 1 characterised in that 
the same number of balls (14) is arranged at one side in the upper 

region of the inner shaped rail (13) as at the opposite side in the 
lower region. 
An extension guide according to claim 1 characterised in that 
the same number of balls is arranged at one side in the upper region 

of the inner shaped rail (13) as at the same side of the lower region. 
An extension guide according to one or more of the preceding 
claims characterised in that the extension guide (10) is provided with 

at least one synchronous roller (15) which is disposed within a slot  
 

defined by the extension rail (11) and the guide rail (12) and which 
rolls on a pin (16) fitted to the inner shaped rail (13). 
An extension guide according to one or more of preceding 
claims 1 to 6 characterised in that a pull-in device is mounted in a 

slot defined by the extension rail (11) and the guide rail (12).
