<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to semiconductor materials and particularly to a 
layer of quantum sized activator doped semiconductor particles and to methods for 
manufacturing these particles. By making semiconductor particles small enough to show quantum 
confinement effects and doping them with a luminescent activator element (referred to 
as "doped nanocrystals"), new optical properties are created which differ from those of 
chemically identical bulk material and from the quantum confined host material alone. 
An activator doped and quantum confined host material was made (ZnS:Mn) that 
demonstrates blue (shorter wavelengths) shift in the excitation wavelengths of the 
activator. These systems also display a dramatic decrease in the time for luminescence 
decay with an efficiency and brightness comparable to bulk (ZnS:Mn) phosphors. These 
new material characteristics indicate a fundamental change in optical properties and this 
is the first time materials exhibiting these characteristics have been made. The invention 
also relates to methods to produce this material and to other unique properties, such as 
reduced excitation voltages for (flat panel) cathode ray tubes. It has been recognized that when the radius of a semiconductor crystallite 
is near that of the Bohr radius of the exciton, there is a quantum size effect and its 
electronic properties change. Most of the II-VI and some III-V and group IV 
semiconductors have been prepared as quantum sized particles and demonstrate quantum 
size effects in their physical properties. The size at which the particles demonstrate 
changes in their bandgap from the quantum size effects vary with the intrinsic electronic 
structure of the compound but typically appear when below 100 Å in diameter. To 
exhibit quantum size effects it is also necessary for the particles to remain isolated from 
one another, if allowed to aggregate the material exhibits bulk properties despite the 
small size of the individual particles. Undoped quantum size particles have previously been prepared in several 
ways: spontaneous nucleation in solution, heterogeneous growth from a substrate  
 
material, growth within a micelle, growth in solution atop a carrier particle, nucleation 
in a sputtering chamber, and laser ablation. The present invention is directed towards 
the doping of a quantum sized semiconductor host material with an activator element 
which demonstrates new material properties. Possible applications for new materials based on the concepts and 
materials described
