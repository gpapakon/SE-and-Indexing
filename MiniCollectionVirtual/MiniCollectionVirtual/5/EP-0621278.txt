<ABSTRACT>
Ti(III) coordination complexes with ethers are prepared by the steps of (a) 
forming an ether complex of a Ti(IV) salt by adding a stoichiometric excess of an 

ether to said salt, and then (b) reducing said complex with an organometallic reducing 
agent such as an aluminum alkyl or a lithium compound to form a Ti(III)-ether 

coordination complex.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to the preparation of Ti(III)-ether coordination
complexes and specifically to the preparation of Ti(III)-ether coordination complexes by
forming an ether complex of a Ti(IV) salt and then reducing the Ti(IV)-ether complex
with an
organometallic or metal hydride reducing agent.Ti(III) coordination complexes with ethers are useful intermediates in the
formation of Ti(III) metallocene compounds such as dicyclopentadienyl titanium
chloride. The metallocene compounds, usually in combination with activators such as
an aluminum alkyl and/or an aluminoxane, can be used as catalysts for stereospecific
olefin polymerization. With respect to preparation of such Ti(III) coordination complexes FR-A-2320309 discloses
a process comprising reduction of TiCl4 and then complexation of the same with an ether
compound. Similarly Coutinho et al., in Eur. Polym. J. Vol. 28, No. 6, pp. 695-698, 1992,
discloses preparations of a Ti(III) ether complex by reduction of TiCl4 and then complexation
of theTi(III) salt with ethers such as dibutylether, diisoamylether, and tetrahydrofurane. The Ti(III) coordination complexes can be produced from the hydrogen
reduced form of a salt such as TiCl3, but this is expensive. A process has now been
developed which provides a one-pot synthesis of Ti(III) coordination complexes
starting with inexpensive Ti(IV) salts.In accordance with this invention there is provided a process for preparing a
Ti(III) coordination complex by the reduction of a Ti(IV) salt, said process comprising
the steps of (a) forming an ether complex of said Ti(IV) salt by adding a
stoichiometric excess of an ether to said salt, and then (b) reducing said complex with
an organometallic or a metal hydride reducing agent to form a Ti(III)-ether
coordination complex.The anions of the Ti(IV) salts for use as starting materials are not critical and
usually have the formula TiX4 where X is halogen. The preferred Ti(IV) compound is
TiCl4. Non-limiting examples of ethers for use in forming the coordination complexes
include ethylene glycol dimethyl ether (DME), diglyme, triglyme, tetraglyme,
tetrahydrofuran, and the like.Suitable organometallic and hydride reducing agents include aluminum alkyls
and lithium compounds, such as lithium alkyls or a lithium hydride. The aluminum
alkyls preferably contain two or three alkyl groups each having from 1 to about 20
carbon atoms. Non-limiting examples of aluminum alkyls include triethylaluminum,
tri-n-propylaluminum, tri-n-butylaluminum, triisobutylaluminum,
