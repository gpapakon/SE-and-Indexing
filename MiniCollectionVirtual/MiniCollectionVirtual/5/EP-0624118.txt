<ABSTRACT>
The grinding device has a frame (2) with three pairs of supports (61, 62, 63) in star array, transportably supported on foot sections (81, 82) on a base, i.e. cylinders (Z1, Z2, Z3). A band grinder (24) is secured to the frame (2) and comprises a pivotable arm (26) bearing a bracket (28) for a contact disc (30). Between the bracket (28) and the base (Z1, Z2, Z3) there is a support (38) comprising a guide rule (24) to guide the contact disc precisely. The present grinding device can be used between closely spaced cylinders (Z1, Z2, Z3), the frame (2) being supported on the cylinders (Z1, Z2, Z3), thus making it possible to grind such cylinders in the simplest possible manner without dismantling them.

placed on the frame (2) and which carries a pillow block (28, 134) 

for the contact wheel (30, 140); 
there is a support mechanism (38, 148) between the pillow block 
(28, 134) and a supporting base (Z₁, Z₂, Z₃). 
Device as claimed in claim 1, wherein the frame (2) displays a central 
body (4), to which the supporting members (6₁, 6₂, 6₃) are attached, 

preferably by means of spacers (23) in a manner enabling the length to 
be adjusted. 
Device as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the supporting foot (8₂) 
of one suppo
rting member (6₃) takes the form of a roller that can be 
driven.  

 
Device as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the supporting feet (8₁) of at 
least two pairs of supporting members (6₁, 6₂) take the form of a cushion 

(10) with air exit orifices (12) directed towards the supporting base in 
order to form air cushions. 
Device as claimed in one of the claims 1 to 4, wherein the pillow block 
(28, 134) is attached in an adjustable manner along the bracket (26, 

130), preferably by means of a clamping device (78). 
Device as claimed in one of the claims 1 to 5, wherein the pillow block 
(28, 134) is attached to the bracket (26, 130) in a manner enabling it to 

swivel on an axis (80, 152) aligned parallel to the axis of the contact 
wheel (30, 140). 
Device as claimed in one of the claims 1 to 6 wherein the pillow block 
(134) has a cardanic suspension device (136) for the center arbor (138) 

of the contact wheel (140). 
Device as claimed in one of the claims 1 to 7, wherein the support 
mechanism (148) rests directly on the supporting base (Z₁) by means of 

a roller (158). 
Device as claimed in claims 7 and 8, wherein the cardanic suspension 
(136) is connected on one side by an articulated joint (152) to a pillow 

block attached to the bracket (130) and at the opposite end has an infeed 
mechanism (146) which acts in conjunction with the free end of a rocker 

(150) also attached by a hinge (154) to the pillow block (134), whereby 
the rocker (150) carries, between the hinge parts, the roller (158) of the 

support mechanism (148) which rests on the supporting base (Z₁).  
 
Device as claimed in one of the claims 1 to 9, wherein the pillow block 
(28, 134) displays the infeed mechanism (62, 146) for the infeed and/or 

positioning of the contact wheel (30, 140) relative to the surface of the 
cylinder (Z₂) to be ground. 
Device as claimed in claim 10, wherein the center arbor of the contact 
wheel (30) is attached to a slide (66) of the infeed mechanism (68), 

whereby the slide (66) travels and/or can be shifted in a slide guide (68) 
on the pillow block (28) by means of an adjusting spindle which can be 

driven. 
Device as claimed in one of the claims 1 to 8, wherein the support 
mechanism (38) displays plinth devices (40) which can be connected to 

the supporting base (Z₁, Z₂, Z₃); the said plinth devices (40) carry the 
common guide rule (42) which contains a guide rail (44) with a rail head 

(104) having a preferably circular cross-section on which a guide block 
(46) can travel, which is connected in a manner allowing the length to be 

adjusted, preferably via a spacer (48), to the pillow block (28) of the 
contact wheel. 
Device as claimed in claim 12, wherein the plinth device (40) displays a 
base plate (84) which can be connected to the supporting base (Z₁, Z₂, 

Z₃) by means of magnetic feet (86) which can be switched on and off, a
