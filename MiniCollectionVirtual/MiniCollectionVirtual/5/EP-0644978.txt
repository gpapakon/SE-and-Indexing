<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus for connecting 
and disconnecting threaded members. In our PCT patent application PCT/EP89/01437 
(Publication No. WO 90/06418) we describe an apparatus 
for connecting and disconnecting threaded members, which 
apparatus comprises a power tong having a pipe receiving 
recess and a jaw assembly for gripping and rotating a 
first pipe, a back-up unit having a pipe receiving 
recess and means for gripping a second pipe, and means 
for transmitting reaction forces generated by said power 
tong to said back-up unit, which means comprises: 
a first member connected to one of said power tong 
and said back-up unit remote from the pipe receiving 
recess thereof and to the other of said power tong and 
said back-up unit to one side of the pipe receiving 
recess thereof; and a second member connected to said one of said power 
tong and said back-up unit remote from the pipe receiving 
recess thereof and to said other of said power tong 
and said back-up unit to the other side of the pipe 
receiving means thereof, wherein said apparatus comprises dynamic means for 
transmitting compressive and/or tensile forces in one of 
said first and second members to the other of said first 
and second members. In the embodiments described in Figures 2 and 3 of 
said PCT patent application, said first member and 
second member each comprise straps, wherein a first 
tension arm is pivotally mounted to one side of one of 
said power tong and said back-up tong, wherein a second 
tension arm is pivotally mounted to the other side of 
said one of said power tong and said back-up tong,  
 
wherein said first tension arm and said second tension 
arm are connected by a third member, and wherein said 
first member is pivotally mounted to said first tension 
arm and said second member is pivotally mounted to said 
second tension arm. Whilst the arrangement shown works admirably for 
most purposes it has the limitation that the power tong 
and the back-up unit cannot be moved close together. The present invention is characterized in that at 
least part of said first and second members lie to 
either side of one of said power tong and said back-up 
tong for enabling the said power tong and the said back-up 
tong to move close together. Preferably, said first member is pivotally mounted 
to said first tension arm between the pivotal mounting 
of said first tension arm to said one of said power tong 
and said back-up tong and said third member, and said 
second member is pivotally mounted to said
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An apparatus (101) for connecting and disconnecting 
threaded members (104, 107), which apparatus comprises a 

power tong (102) having a pipe receiving recess (103) 
and a jaw assembly for gripping and rotating a first 

pipe (104), a back-up unit (105) for gripping a second 
pipe (107), and means for transmitting reaction forces 

generated by said power tong (102) to said back-up unit 
(105), which means comprises 


a first member (117) connected to one of said power 
tong (102) and said back-up unit (105) remote from the 

pipe receiving recess (103) thereof and to the other of 
said power tong (102) and said back-up unit (105) to one 

side of the pipe receiving recess (103) thereof; and 
a second member (118) connected to said one of said 
power tong (102) and said back-up unit (105) remote from 

the pipe receiving recess (103) thereof and to said 
other of said power tong (102) and said back-up unit 

(105) to the other side of the pipe receiving recess 
(103) thereof; 
 
   wherein said first member (117) and second member 

(118) each comprise straps, wherein a first tension arm 
(119) is pivotally mounted to one side of one of said 

power tong and said back-up tong, wherein a second 
tension arm (120) is pivotally mounted to the other side 

of said one of said power tong (102) and said back-up 
tong (105), wherein said first tension arm (119) and 

said second tension arm (120) are connected by a third 
member (121), and wherein said first member (117) is 

pivotally mounted to said first tension arm (119) and 
said second member (118) is pivotally mounted to said 

second tension arm (120), the arrangement being characterized 
in that at least part of said first and second 

members (117, 118) lie to either side of said one of 
said power tong (102) and said back-up tong (105) for  

 
enabling the said power tong and the said back-up tong 

to move close together. 
An apparatus as claimed in Claim 1, characterized 
in that said first member (117) is pivotally mounted to 

said first tension arm (119) between the pivotal mounting 
of said first tension arm (117) to said one of said 

power tong (102) and said back-up tong (105) and said 
third member (121), and said second member (118) is 

pivotally mounted to said second tension arm (120) 
between the pivotal mounting of said second tension arm 

(120) to said one of said power tong (102) and said 
back-up tong (105) and said third member (121). 
An apparatus as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that one (102) of said power tong (102) and said 

back-up tong (105) includes flanges (122) which extend 
away from the other (105) of said power tong (102) and 

said back-up tong (105), and said first tension arm 
(119) and said second tension arm (120) are pivotally 

mounted to said flanges. 
An apparatus as claimed in Claim 1, 2 or 3, characterized 
in that said power tong (102) is provided with a 

support rod (108, 109) provided with a support plate 
(112, 113) on which a hollow pillar (115, 116) rests and 

on which hollow pillar (115, 116) said back-up tong 
(105) is slidably mounted. 
An apparatus as claimed in Claim 4, characterized 
in that it includes a coil spring (124) which at least 

partially supports said back-up tong (105).
