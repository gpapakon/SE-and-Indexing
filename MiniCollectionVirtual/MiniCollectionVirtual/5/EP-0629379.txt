<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus, provided with an ultrasound transmitter connectable to an ultrasound generator (17), for detaching atherosclerotic plaque by means of ultrasonic vibrations, comprises a probe (7; 8) fastened on a handle (1). The probe (7; 8) comprises an essentially transversally oscillating working part and an essentially longitudinally oscillating transmission part. The transmission part is completely enclosed by a tube carrying liquid which serves to wet the working part of the probe (7; 8), a channel being provided in the handle (1) for supply of liquid into the tube. The tube is made of a material whose coefficient of friction is negligible relative to the liquid, and there are means for wetting the working part with liquid on all sides.
