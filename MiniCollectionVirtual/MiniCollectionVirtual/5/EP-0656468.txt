<ABSTRACT>
A cooling system for stationary vanes in the turbine 
section of a gas turbine. Combustors for the turbine 

are disposed in a chamber (10) that receives compressed air from 
a compressor section. This compressed air forms both 

combustion air and cooling air. The cooling air portion of 
the compressed air is recirculated through the vanes (28) by 

bleeding it from the chamber and further pressurizing it, 
after which it flows through a cooling air flow path in the 

vanes, thereby resulting in the cooling of the vanes and 
the heating of the air. The heated air is then returned to 

the chamber (10) where it mixes with the incoming combustion 
air, thereby giving up a portion of the heat transferred 

from the vane to the combustion air. As a result, the 
temperature of the combustion air is increased, thereby 

increasing the thermodynamic efficiency of the gas turbine. 
The cooling scheme provides cooling to the vane inner and 

outer shrouds, as well as the airfoil, by means of 
circumferentially extending holes in the shrouds that 

connect with a cooling air cavity in the airfoil.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cooling system
for a stationary vane in a gas turbine. More specifically,
the present invention relates to a cooling air system in
which compressed air is recirculated through the vane.A gas turbine is comprised of a compressor section
that produces compressed air that is subsequently heated by
burning fuel in a combustion section. The hot gas from the
combustion section is directed to a turbine section where
the hot gas is used to drive a rotor shaft to produce
power. The combustion section is typically comprised of a
shell that forms a chamber that receives compressed air
from the compressor section. A plurality of cylindrical
combustors are disposed in the chamber and receive the
compressed air along with the fuel to be burned. A duct is
connected to the aft end of each combustor and serves to
direct the hot gas from the combustor to the turbine
section.The turbine section typically employs a plurality
of stationary vanes circumferentially arranged in rows.
Since such vanes are exposed to the hot gas discharging
from the combustion section, cooling of these vanes is of
utmost importance. Traditionally, cooling was accomplished
by flowing cooling air from the chamber through a cavity
formed in the airfoil portion of the vane, which is essentially
hollow. Typically, a number of small passages are
formed inside the vane airfoil that extend from the cavity
to the surfaces of the vane, such as the leading and 
trailing edges or the suction and pressure surfaces. Often,
such as in the case of leading edge cooling, the passages
direct the cooling air from the cavity so that it flows
over the surface of the vane in a thin film, thereby cooling
the vane in what is often referred to as "film
cooling." In any case, after the cooling air exits the
vane passages, it enters and mixes with the hot gas flowing
through the turbine section.Reference is made to prior art document GB-A-775057,
which illustrates a typical prior art cooling scheme wherein
air from the compressor is used for cooling of turbine
parts and is subsequently mixed with the combustion exhaust
gases.Unfortunately, the traditional approach to cooling the
turbine vanes has a detrimental impact on the thermal
efficiency of the gas turbine. Although the cooling air
eventually mixes with the hot gas expanding in the turbine,
since it bypasses the combustion process the work recovered
from the expansion of the compressed cooling air is much
less than that recovered from the expansion of the compressed
air heated in the
