<ABSTRACT>
A tightening device comprises an upper 
plate (1), a lower plate (3) disposed below the upper plate (1) in 

parallel thereto, a nut rotating gear (4) supported by the 
lower plate (3) so as to be rotatable in a horizontal 

plane, and a spur gear (27) provided on an underside of the 
upper plate (1) and meshable with the gear (4) for rotating 

the gear (4). The upper plate (1) has a portion (2) fittable to 
a flange of an externally threaded member for preventing 

the rotation of the threaded member, while the nut 
rotating gear (4) has a portion (5) fittable to a nut. With 

the nut manually tightened on the threaded member in 
advance, the flange fitting portion (2) of the upper plate (1) 

is fitted to the flange, the nut is fitted in the fitting 
portion (5) of the nut rotating gear (4), and the spur gear (27) 

is thereafter rotated, whereby the nut rotating gear (4) 
is driven to tighten up the nut on the threaded member.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for tightening up a nut srewed
on a threaded member according to the preamble of claim 1.Pipe joints are already known which comprise
a first tubular joint member having a hexagonal flange
and an externally threaded portion, a second tubular
joint member disposed end to end therewith, an
annular gasket interposed between the opposed end faces
of the two joint members, a nut provided on the second
joint member and screwed on the first joint member and
a thrust bearing provided between the second joint
member and the nut.With the pipe joint, a fluid-tight connection
is provided by manually tightening the nut on the
first joint member first and thereafter tightening up
the nut with a tool with the hexagonal flange of the
first joint member held with another tool. To tighten
up the nut suitably, a mark is made on each of the
first joint member and the nut after the nut has been
manually tightened, and the nut is then turned through 
a required angle with reference to the marks. Alternatively,
the nut is turned with a torque wrench
serving as the tightening tool until a required torque
value is obtained to ensure tightening. DE-U-9 âŠ˜12 774 discloses a device for tightening up a nut
screwed on an externally threaded member having a flange
according to the preamble of claim 1. The device comprises a
body, a member for preventing rotation of the externally
threaded member, which projects forward from a front end of
the body and has a flange fitting portion open in a predetermined
direction, a gear support member attached to the
preventing member and having a gear support portion coaxial
with the flange fitting portion and a nut rotating gear having
a nut fitting portion coaxial with and open generally in the
same direction as the flange fitting portion. The gear is
supported by the gear support member so as to be rotatable
about an axis of the nut fitting portion. The device further
comprises a transmission gear attached to the preventing
member and meshable with the nut rotating gear to rotate the
gear, and means for driving the transmission gear.With the prior art tightening device the nut is manually
tightened on the externally threaded member in advance, the
flange fitting portion of the preventing member is fitted to
the flange of the threaded member, the nut fitting portion of
the nut rotating gear is further fitted to the nut, and the
transmission gear is thereafter rotated by the driving means,
whereby the nut rotating gear ist rotated to tighten up the
nut on
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A device for tightening up a nut (36) screwed
on an externally threaded member (35) having a flange (35a), the

device comprising a body (30; 70), a member (1; 71) for preventing
rotation of the externally threaded member (35), the

preventing member (1; 71) projecting foward from a front end
of the body (30; 70) and having a flange fitting portion (2; 72) open

in a predetermined direction, a gear Support member (3; 73)
