<ABSTRACT>
A process is provided for the catalytic perfluoroalkylation of aromatic compounds, wherein a perfluoroalkyl iodide or mixture of iodides is reacted with an aromatic compound in the presence of an aqueous base, such as an alkali metal hydroxide or carbonate. The use of an aqueous strong base increases the rate of reaction. Further improvements in rate and yield are secured by employing, as the catalyst, a noble metal supported on porous silica microspheres.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for fluoroalkylation of aromatic 
compounds and polymers. It relates also to novel products produced thereby. More 
especially this invention relates to the preparation of polyfluoroalkyl aromatic 
compounds and polymers by the metal-catalyzed reaction of a perfluoroalkyl iodide 
with an aromatic compound. Catalytic perfluoroalkylation of aromatic compounds is known in the 
art. The process, as taught in the art, provides a method whereby an 
unfunctionalized aromatic group is substituted with a perfluoroalkyl group with the 
concurrent production of hydrogen iodide. A process for the catalytic addition of 
perfluoroalkyl iodide to benzene using a ruthenium catalyst on carbon and 
employing solid potassium carbonate as a hydrogen iodide acceptor is disclosed in 
European Patent Application NO. 0 114 359 of Werner. Good yields of the 
perfluoroalkyl benzene are reported but only when large amounts of catalyst are 
used. The present invention is an improvement in a process for the 
catalyzed fluoroalkylation of aromatic compounds, the improvement comprising 
conducting the fluoroalkylation reaction with a supported metal catalyst, in the 
presence of an aqueous base. The improvement is, in effect, a method for 
increasing the rate of reaction during the catalyzed fluoroalkylation of aromatic 
compounds. The preferred base is aqueous potassium hydroxide or aqueous 
potassium carbonate and the preferred catalyst is palladium and/or platinum on 
silica prepared as described in WO 92/04976. 
Conducting the fluoroalkylation reaction in the 
presence of aqueous base unexpectedly increases the rate of reaction by a factor of 
up to about 20:1 in comparison to the rate of reaction achieved by Werner in the 
aforesaid European Patent Application. Furthermore, conducting the 
fluoroalkylation with catalysts of the type described in the above WO 92/04976 
may increase the rate of reaction by a factor of up to about 9:1 when 
compared to the rate achieved in accordance with the present invention when using  
 
a Pd on C catalyst. By employing the two features in combination the rate of 
fluoroalkylation may be about increased by a factor of about 36 over the prior art 
processes. The process of the invention can be conveniently expressed by the 
following reaction:- 
XArH + YRfI + MOH (aqueous) Catalyst XArYRf + MI + H20 
The Aromatic Compound (XArH) The aromatic compound should have at least one unsubstituted 
position (represented by "H") and may contain one or more substituents
