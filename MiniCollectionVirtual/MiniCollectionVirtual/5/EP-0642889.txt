<ABSTRACT>
An abrasive article having a surface having a 
machine direction axis and opposite side edges, each 

side edge being parallel to the machine direction axis 
and each side edge being respectively within a first 

and second imaginary plane each of which is 
perpendicular to the surface, a plurality of parallel 

elongate abrasive ridges deployed in fixed position on 
the surface, each ridge having a longitudinal axis 

located at its transverse center and extending along an 
imaginary line which intersects said first and second 

planes at angle which is neither 0° nor 90°, a distal 
end which is spaced from the surface, and a midpoint 

located on its outer surface defined by an imaginary 
line which is within a third imaginary plane which 

contains the longitudinal axis and is perpendicular to 
the surface, wherein adjacent midpoints of adjacent 

ridges are equally spaced apart. The resulting abrasive 
article provides a high rate of cut, long belt life, 

and a relatively fine surface finish on the workpiece 
being abraded.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an abrasive article
(e.g., sheet or belt) according to the preamble of
claim 1, which is known, for example, from US-A-5 152 917,
and to
methods for making the same.In general abrasive articles comprise a plurality
of abrasive particles bonded either together (e.g., a
bonded abrasive or grinding wheel) or to a backing
(e.g., a coated abrasive). These abrasive articles
have been utilized to abrade and finish workpieces for
well over a hundred years.One problem that has always plagued the abrasive
industry is the generally inverse relationship
associated between the cut rate (i.e., the amount of
workpiece removed for a given time interval) and the
useful life of the abrasive article. What is desired
by the industry is an abrasive article that has a
relatively high rate of cut, a long usable life, and
which imparts a relatively fine, and smooth, surface
finish on the workpiece being abraded.One solution to this problem is disclosed in U.S.
Patent No. 5,152,917 (Pieper et al.). Pieper et al
teaches a structured abrasive that results in a
relatively high rate of cut with long abrasive life.
U.S. Application 08/067,708 filed May 26, 1993 (Mucci
et al.) teaches a method of imparting a fine finish on
a workpiece by using a structured abrasive and
oscillating either the workpiece or abrasive during
use, such that the resulting scratch pattern crosses 
the previous scratch pattern, resulting in a finer
finish.There exists a vast array of different abrading
applications. While Pieper et al. and Mucci et al.
represent advancements in the abrasive field for many
abrading applications, there remains room for
improvement even above and beyond Pieper et al. and
Mucci et al.U.S. Patent No. 2,115,897 (Wooddell et al.)
teaches an abrasive article having a backing having
attached thereto by an adhesive a plurality of bonded
abrasive segments. These bonded abrasive segments can
be adhesively secured to the backing in a specified
pattern.U.S. Patent No. 2,242,877 (Albertson) teaches a
method of making a compressed abrasive disc. Several
layers of coated abrasive fibre discs are placed in a
mold and then subjected to heat and pressure to form
the compressed center disc. The mold has a specified
pattern, which then transfers to the compressed center
disc, thus rendering a pattern coated abrasive article.U.S. Patent No. 2,755,607 (Haywood) teaches a
coated abrasive in which there are lands and grooves of
abrasive portions. An adhesive coat is applied to the
front surface of a backing and this adhesive

opposite side edges, each side edge being parallel to said machine direction axis;

and a plurality of parallel rows of precisely shaped abrasive composites in fixed
position on said surface, each precisely shaped abrasive composite comprising

abrasive particles and binder and having a base attached to laid surface, a height
and a distal end spaced by said height from said surface, characterized in that the bases

of said precisely shaped abrasive composites in the same row are aligned at an angle
with respect to one of said side edges which is neither 0° nor 90°.

comprising: applying to a surface having a machine direction axis, opposite ends

and opposite side edges, each side edge being parallel to said machine direction
axis, a plurality of parallel rows of precisely shaped abrasive composites in fixed

position on said surface, each precisely shaped abrasive composite comprising
abrasive particles and binder and having a base attached to said surface, a height

and a distal end spaced by said height from said surface, the bases of said
precisely shaped abrasive composites in the same row being aligned at an angle

with respect to one of said side edges which is neither 0° nor 90°.
A method of making an abrasive article of any of claims 1-3, said method
comprising:


(a) providing an abrasive article having a backing which includes a surface having
opposite initial side edges and a plurality of parallel rows of precisely shaped

abrasive composites in fixed position on said surface, each precisely shaped
