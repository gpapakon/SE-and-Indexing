<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention lies in the field of water-soluble
antioxidant formulations. More specifically, the
present invention lies in the field of hydrolyzable, watersoluble
derivatives of probucol compounds for various
applications.Probucol is a potent antioxidant, chemically
related to the widely used food additives 2,[3]-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyanisole
(BHA) and 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol
(BHT). Probucol and various related compounds have been
discussed in various Patents including the following: U.S.
Patent No. 3,485,843 issued to Wang, U.S. Patent No.
3,576,833 issued to Neuworth, U.S. Patent No. 3,862,232
issued to Barnhart etal., and U.S. Patent No. 4,985,465
issued Hendler. Its full chemical name is 4,4'-(isopropylidenedithio)
bis(2,6-di-tert-butylphenol), and it
has the following structure:
Today, probucol is used primarily to lower serum
cholesterol levels in hypercholesterolemic patients, but
recent work has shown that it also may be used to treat
other ailments such as viral and retroviral infections (e.g.
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection). The antiviral
properties of probucol are discussed in U.S. Patent
No. 4,985,465, which is incorporated herein by reference for
all purposes. Probucol has also been claimed to be
effective in treating arrhythmia; see U.S. Patent No.
4,719,237 issued to McCaughan.Recent evidence suggests that the atherogenic
effects of low density lipoprotein (LDL) may be in part
mediated through its oxidative modification. Probucol has
been shown to possess potent antioxidant properties and to
block oxidative modification of LDL. Consistent with these
findings, probucol has been shown to actually slow the
progression of atherosclerosis in LDL receptor-deficient
rabbits as discussed in Carew etal. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.
USA 84:7725-7729 (1987) which is incorporated herein by
reference for all purposes. Most likely, probucol is
effective because it is highly lipid soluble and is
transported by lipoproteins, thus protecting them against
oxidative damage.Unfortunately, probucol is almost insoluble in
water and therefore cannot be injected intravenously (it is
even difficult for cells to take it up invitro because of
its poor miscibility in buffers and media for cell culture).
Thus, probucol is commonly administered in the form of
tablets available under the trademark Lorelcoâ„¢ (Marion
Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Kansas City, MO).
However, solid probucol is poorly absorbed into the blood,
and is excreted in substantially unchanged form. Further,
the tablet
