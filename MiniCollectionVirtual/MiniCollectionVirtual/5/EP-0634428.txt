<ABSTRACT>
A process for the polymerization of polymers of itaconic acid and vinyl 
acetate comprising the step of polymerizing 


(i) from 10 to 95 mole percent of monomer units of the formula I: 

 
wherein each of R₁ and R₂, which may be the same or different, 

represents a hydrogen atom, a methyl group or an ethyl group, and M 
is a hydrogen atom or an alkyl (C₁ to C₁₈) chain or an organic group 

such as an amino containing functionality; 
(ii) from 5 to 90 mole percent of monomer units of the formula II: 

 
wherein R₃ represents a hydrogen atom or the group -COCH₃; and 
(iii) from 0 to 45 mole percent of a ethylenically unsaturated 
copolymerizable comonomer, said polymerization being carried out 

using semi-batch polymerization procedures at a temperature of 60 to 
200°c in the presence of a substantially anhydrous alcoholic 

solvent.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a process for the preparation, at high
conversion, of biodegradable polymers of itaconic acid and vinyl acetate or vinyl
alcohol. Polymers made by this process are suitable for use as detergent
additives, scale inhibitors and removers, sequestrants, yarn sizers,
deflocculating agents, de-inking agents, suspending agents and dispersing agents.Processes for the preparation of polymers of itaconic acid are known in the
art. However, while the prior art processes have had some impact on resolving
inherent difficulties in polymerizing this dicarboxylic acid, low polymerization
conversion of the acid continues to be a problem. High levels of unpolymerized
monomers in the final product raise serious environmental concerns and cause
significant application problems. Additionally, many of the processes are known
to be difficult, erratic and inconsistent.European Patent Application 0 506 246 published September 30, 1992
describes a process for preparing polymers of itaconic acid, optionally together
with acrylic acid, in water wherein the monomers(s) are neutralized to a level
of 80 to 100 equivalent percent prior to or during the polymerization reaction.The method described in the latter application has however, not been found
useful in the polymerization of itaconic acid with vinyl acetate or vinyl alcohol
due to poor conversion of both itaconic acid and the vinyl compound.GB-A-1 041 910 discloses a method for the preparation of
film-forming polymers of maleic alkyl half ester, crotonic
acid and vinyl acetate by polymerization.L. Kotzeva, Journal of Pol. Sci.; Part A, Pol. Chem., Vol.
27, 1989, 1325-1332 describes the copolymerization of vinyl
acetate with itaconic acid and diethyl itaconate at concentrations
up to 9 mol % in methanol solution using azo-bis-isobutyronitrile
and tert-butylcyclohexylperoxydicarbonate as
initiators. The experiments were performed using two
different methods of addition of the itaconic monomer,
single, at the beginning of the process, and continuous. It
has been found that the process rate decreases as the
quantity of the second comonomer increases.We have now found that polymers of itaconic acid and vinyl acetate or vinyl
alcohol may be prepared efficiently and at high conversion when the
polymerization is carried out using substantially anhydrous alcohol as the
solvent.  Thus the present invention is directed to a process for the production
of polymers of itaconic acid and vinyl acetate or vinyl alcohol comprising
(i) from 10 to 95 mole
