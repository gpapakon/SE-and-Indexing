<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus (200) for developing a 
latent image formed on a photoreceptor, which is 

deposited on an interior surface of a faceplate 
panel (12) of a CRT display device (10), is 

disclosed. The developing apparatus includes a 
developing chamber (202), having a support surface 

(204) for supporting the panel, a screen structure 
material reservoir (222) for storing, 

deagglomerating and feeding the screen structure 
material (226), and a triboelectric gun assembly 

(236) communicating with the reservoir. The gun 
assembly triboelectric charges and imparts a 

desired charge polarity to the screen structure 
material. The gun assembly further includes at 

least one material dispersing nozzle (238) spaced 
from the support surface, for distributing the 

charged material for deposition onto the latent 
image.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus 
for developing a latent charge image formed on a 
photoreceptor which is disposed on an interior 
surface of an output window of a display device, 
such as a cathode-ray tube (CRT), and, more 
particularly, to a developer which provides a 
triboelectric charge of a desired polarity to the 
developing materials. U.S. Pat. No. 4,921,767, issued to Datta 
et al. on May 1, 1990, discloses a method for 
electrophotographically manufacturing a luminescent 
screen assembly on an interior surface of a CRT 
faceplate panel, using dry-powdered, 
triboelectrically-charged, screen structure 
materials deposited on a latent image formed on an 
electrostatically charged photoreceptor. The 
photoreceptor comprises a photoconductive layer 
overlying a conductive layer, both of which are 
deposited, serially, as solutions, on the interior 
surface of the CRT panel. In the aforementioned 
patent, the four developers utilized for depositing 
the screen structure materials are the so-called 
"powder cloud" developers of the type in which 
particles of screen structure materials are 
triboelectrically charged by contacting surface-treated 
carrier beads. The charged particles of 
screen structure materials are then expelled from 
the developers and onto the latent image. A 
drawback of this type of powder cloud developer is 
that it is unsuitable for manufacturing production 
quantities of luminescent screens, where the 
development time for depositing each of the 
different materials must be of the order of about 15 
seconds for each material.  
 The invention is defined in independent claims 1 and 2. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, 
an apparatus for developing a latent image formed 
on a photoreceptor, which is deposited on an 
interior surface of an output window of a display 
device, is disclosed. The developing apparatus 
includes a developing chamber, having a support 
surface for supporting the output window, a screen 
structure material reservoir for storing, 
deagglomerating and feeding the screen structure 
material, and a triboelectric gun assembly 
communicating with the reservoir. The gun assembly 
includes triboelectric charging means for imparting 
a desired charge polarity to the screen structure 
material and at least one material dispersing 
means, spaced from the support surface, for 
distributing the charged material for deposition 
onto the latent image. In the drawings: Fig. 1 is a plan view, partially in axial 
section, of a color CRT
