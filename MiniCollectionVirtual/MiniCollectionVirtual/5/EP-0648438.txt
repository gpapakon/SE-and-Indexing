<ABSTRACT>
An opening cover for covering an opening in a garment (11) which has an upper material (17) which is not waterproof and a waterproof, water vapour-permeable functional layer (21) arranged inside the upper material, and which is provided with a panel (29) which covers the opening (23) in the garment and is connected at an upper edge to an upper edge of the opening in the garment. The opening cover (15) has an opening cover mask (33) made of waterproof mask material with a mask opening (41). The opening cover mask (33) also has an outer layer (35) which is to be arranged on the outer side of the upper material (17) of the garment (11) and an inner layer (37) which is to be arranged on the inner side of the upper material (17) of the garment (11). The outer layer (35) of the mask has a mask panel part (49) and a mask part (47), said mask panel part (49) being connectable to the inner side of the panel (29), and said mask part (47) of the outer layer (35) of the mask being connectable, in its edge regions situated below and to the sides of the mask opening (41) and located away from the mask opening (41), to corresponding edge regions of the outer side of the upper material (17) of the garment (11). The inner layer (37) of the mask can be connected to the functional layer (21) at its peripheral edge, located away from the mask opening (41), on the inner side of the upper material (17) of the garment (11). The outer layer (35) and the inner layer (37) of the mask are sealed off at the edge of the mask opening by means of a waterproof adhesive seam (45).

its peripheral edge remote from the mask through-opening

(41), is adapted to be connected to the
peripheral edge of a functional layer through-opening

(25), with the functional layer through-opening
edge (65), as seen from the mask through-opening

(41), being located externally of the garment
through-opening edge.

characterized in that the mask outer layer (35) is
connected to the outside of the two-ply laminate 

constituted by the outer material ply, and the mask
inner layer (37) is connected to the inside of the

two-ply laminate constituted by the functional layer
ply.
The opening facing of claim 3 or 4 for a garment
(11) having a lining (19) disposed loosely inside

the functional layer (21),

characterized in that the opening facing mask (33)
comprises a mask inner trimming (39) disposed internally
