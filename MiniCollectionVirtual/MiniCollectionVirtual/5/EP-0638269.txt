<ABSTRACT>
In order to visibly display products of various types and provide 
product storage therefor while restricting access to the products for 

security reasons 
and/or to maintain the products in a clean condition, a product display 

and storage 
cabinet is provided. The cabinet (10) includes first (12) and second 

(14) distinct product display 
sections arranged integrally adjacent to one another. The first section 

(12) has a plurality 
of distinct product display levels extending from a lower extreme to an upper 

extreme in generally step-like fashion. The cabinet also has a single 
product display 

level for the second section (14) extending from the first section (12) 
at one of the extremes 

thereof. In one embodiment, a plurality of walls (24,28,30) 
integrally surround the first and 

second sections to define an enclosure for product storage and separate 
transparent 

lids (58,60) cover the first section and the second section to restrict 
access thereto.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is generally directed to displaying products and,
more particularly, a product display and storage cabinet with unique features.Generally speaking, it is known that there is a need for devices that
are capable of displaying a product for sale. This is true of virtually every product
manufactured for sale and, particularly in the retail environment, there are oftentimes
special needs that must be met. In practice, these special needs are usually
interrelated in a difficult, if not impossible, manner to successfully achieve.More specifically, the primary requirement for nearly any product
display device is to render the product visible. It is frequently an additional
requirement to be able to display a plurality of different, but related, products in a
single product display device and, in some instances, it is important to either restrict
direct access to the products by the consumer or, at a minimum, to cover the
products to keep them dust and dirt free and not readily accessible for handling by 
passing consumers. Still additionally, it is generally
known that most retail environments suffer from a shortage
of space for storage of products for sale.As a result, those who market products have
faced particularly perplexing problems in maximizing
exposure to and availability of their products to the
consuming public. The first of these problems centers on
having a product display that permits adequate viewing of
products in an attractive fashion while, if necessary,
restricting access to and/or protecting the products from
dust and dirt. Ironically, if the display of a product is
successful, and the sales are at a significant level, a
lack of storage may result in an inadequate inventory of
that product.For this reason, it would be highly advantageous
to have what would functionally constitute a combined
product display and storage cabinet particularly well
suited for the retail market. This would allow not only
for advantageously displaying a product or products in an
attractive, secure and clean environment but also would
provide storage at the point of display of the product so
that there would also be an adequate inventory available
to maintain the display with a full quantity of the
product. Of course, the product display and storage
cabinet should also be provided with suitable means for
identifying one or more of the products and for placing
possible pricing information thereon.US-A-2,112,070 discloses a display and storage device for
