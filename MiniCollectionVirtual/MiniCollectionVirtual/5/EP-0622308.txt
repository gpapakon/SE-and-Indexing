<ABSTRACT>
A sales package, in particular for electric batteries, consists of two parts which are connected to one another by gluing or stapling and are formed from card or another environmentally friendly recyclable material, and comprise a first part in the form of a backing panel (1) with a hanging-up hole (6) and a second part in the form of a cuboid receiving container (2) which receives the batteries (7), is produced by folding a punched-out flat blank (5), has a window surface (4) and is attached on the front surface (1a) of the backing panel (1). Relative to the vertical position of the customary presentation of the sales package, the vertical side walls (2b) of the receiving container (2) and their attachment flanges (2d) have, at their lower ends, respective vertical continuations (3) for the attachment on the backing panel (1), which continuations extend down to the extent that they reach up to the lower edge (1c) of the backing panel (1) and form, together therewith, a bottom plane which is disposed at a right angle to the backing panel (1).
