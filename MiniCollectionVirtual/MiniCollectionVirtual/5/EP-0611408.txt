<ABSTRACT>
A cork covering (1, 10), in particular a floor cork covering, has a top cork layer (2, 11) constituted by at least one layer of cork pellets (4) and a support layer (3). The support layer, which is fixedly linked to the top layer (2, 11), is composed of agglomerated thermoplastic foil pieces (8) compacted and linked by pressure and heat application.

Cork covering (1, 10), in particular cork floor covering, with a 
cork layer (2, 11) formed by at least one stratum of discrete cork 

material (4) as an upper layer and with a supporting layer (3) which 
is firmly bonded to the upper layer (2, 11) and comprises pieces of 

thermoplastic synthetic resin sheet material (8) compressed and 
bonded together by the action of pressure and temperature. 
Cork covering according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the 
discrete cork material (2) is in the form of cork granules (4). 
Cork covering according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 the 
cork layer is formed by a thin stratum (11) of discrete cork 

material, in particular cork granules. 
Cork covering according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 the 
pieces of synthetic resin sheet material (8) originate from 

polyolefin sheets, in particular polyethylene scrap sheets. 
Cork covering according to one of the foregoing claims, 

characterised in that
 the synthetic resin material (8) has other, 
non-thermoplastic, materials added in with it. 
Cork covering according to one of the foregoing claims, 

characterised in that
 the supporting layer (3) has different degrees 
of density over its cross-section. 
Cork covering according to claim 4, 
characterised in that
 the 
alteration in density is continuous.  

 
Cork covering according to one of the foregoing claims, 

characterised in that
 the supporting layer (3) has strata of glass 
fibre or glass fibre felt. 
Cork covering according to one of the foregoing claims, 

characterised in that
 the supporting layer (3) has air pockets or 
cavities (9). 
Cork covering according to one of the foregoing claims, 

characterised in that
 it is made thin and deformable with heat. 
Cork covering according to one of the foregoing claims, 
characterised in that other materials are added to the cork layer (2). 
Method of manufacturing a cork covering according to one of the 
foregoing claims, 
characterised in that
 thermoplastic pieces of 
synthetic resin sheet material (8) are poured in several strata to 

form a layer, a cork layer (2, 11) comprising at least one stratum 
of discrete cork material (4) is deposited on this layer, and the two 

layers are bonded together by the action of pressure and heat, the 
synthetic resin sheet pieces (8) being compressed to form a 

supporting layer (3) and at least partially bonded together. 
Method of manufacturing a cork covering according to one of 
claims 1 to 11, 
characterised in that
 pieces of thermoplastic 
synthetic resin sheet material (8) are deposited in a number of 

strata to form a layer and compressed by the action of pressure and 
heat to form a supporting layer (3), the pieces becoming at least 

partially bonded together, and that subsequently a cork layer  
 

(2, 11) comprising at least one stratum of discrete cork material is 
deposited on this supporting layer (3) and the two layers are 

connected together by the application of pressure and heat, whereby 
the supporting layer (3) is finally compressed. 
Method according to one of claims 12 or 13, 
characterised in that
 
the temperature lies in the range of the softening temperature of the 

synthetic resins employed. 
Method according to one of claims 12 to 14, 
characterised in that
 
a thermo-adhesive layer is applied to the deposited layer (3) of 

synthetic resin sheet material (8) before the bonding to the cork 
layer (2, 11). 
Method according to one of claims 12 to 15, 
characterised in that
 
the action of pressure and heat is applied continuously by means of 

a calender roll. 
Method according to one of claims 12 to 16, 
characterised in that
 
the pieces (8) of synthetic resin sheet are shaped spatially before 

the compression. 
Method according to one of claims 12 to 17, 
characterised in that
 
the pieces (8) of synthetic resin sheet are of flake-like form before 

the compression. 
Method according to one of claims 12 to 18, 
characterised in that
 
the pieces (8) of synthetic resin sheet have other materials, in 

particular pieces or threads of textile materials, mixed in with 
them.  

 
Method according to one of claims 12 to 19, 
characterised in that
 
a binding medium (5) is added to the cork layer (2) made up of 

cork granules (4).
