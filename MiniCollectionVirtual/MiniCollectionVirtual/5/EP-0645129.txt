<ABSTRACT>
A light-weight modular utility cart has first and second identical side members (11, 13) 
which are pref
erably one-piece, molded plastic structures. Each side member (11, 13) 
includes a plurality of upwardly-angled drawer rails (31) on an inside surface thereof. 

The drawers (29) may include identical first and second rollers (101, 103) each having 
a circumferential groove (105) in the center thereof adapted to ride on an uppermost 

edge of the upwardly-angled drawer rail (31).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a modular utility cart
and, more particularly, to such a cart that is easy to
manufacture, assemble, and use. While the present
invention will be described in with specific reference to
a medical utility cart usable in hospitals, doctors
offices, and the like, it is to be understood that the
teachings of this application, and the claims appended
hereto, pertain to a modular utility cart that can be used
for any purpose.The field of carts is rather well-developed with various
examples being used in medical, retail, manufacturing, and
other environments. Generally, a cart comprises four
sides and a top, and may be movable. However, most known
carts consist of a large number of independent structures
that must be welded, bolted, or connected together in some
other way. Thus, manufacturing and assembling known carts
requires a great number of steps that can be expensive and
time consuming.A further drawback to known carts is that they often
require extensive modification for particular 
applications. That is, each cart user is required to
modify his or her cart in order to adapt it to his or her
particular requirements.The above-described problems are particularly
disadvantageous in the medical field where carts are
required to hold a wide range of medical equipment and
accessories such as electrical components, surgical tape
dispensers, waste containers, and the like. Furthermore,
medical carts should be light-weight, easy to maintain,
and adaptable to fit a wide variety of uses such as in the
emergency rooms, operating theaters, and patient rooms.Therefore, what is needed is an inexpensive, easy-to-assemble,
light-weight cart which can be readily adapted
to a wide variety of applications.Carts used in the medical field are well known. One
consists of a design originally made for storing tools and
is formed of sheet metal. This example has a fixed number
of standard-sized drawers, generally of only one
configuration, and a fixed top of standard height.
Because of the design and materials used in its
construction, this known cart cannot be easily adapted to
specific applications, is heavy, and, therefore, is
cumbersome to use. InterMetro Industries Corporation, assignee of the subject
invention, also offers a Medical Emergency Crash Cart that
is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,790,610 and in pending
U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 243,212. This design
represented a substantial improvement over known carts in
the art. However it was specifically conceived as a crash
cart,

A modular cart comprising:

first and second side panels (11, 13), each having a plurality of drawer rails (31); and
at least one drawer (29) being guided by said rails (31),
characterized in that
said rails are upwardly-angled transversely to their longitudinal axes; and
said at least one drawer (29) has first and second rollers (101, 103), said first and

second rollers riding on one rail (31) and being guided by a rail adjacent said one rail
(31).
A cart according to claim 1,
characterized in that
said first and second rollers (101, 103) are identical.
A cart according to claim 1 or 2,

characterized in that

said first roller (101) comprises a cylindrically-shaped body having

a) a trapezoidal-shaped circumferential groove (105) in a center portion of the
outer surface thereof, and
b) an edge (107) that is one of rounded and beveled on an outer portion of the
outer surface thereof.
A cart according to claim 3,
characterized in that
said groove (105) of said first roller (101) rides on an edge of said one rail (31), and
said beveled edge (107) of said first roller (101) is guided by a lower surface of said

adjacent rail.
A cart according to any one of claims 1 to 4,

characterized in that

said one rail (31) includes a stop at one end thereof for stopping horizontal movement
of said drawer (29).
A cart according to claim 5,
characterized in that
said first panel (11), said drawer rails (31) and said stop are formed in a one-piece
structure.
A cart according to any one of claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that
the spacing between said rails (31) of said first and second side panels (11, 13) are
uniform and predetermined to accomodate either (a) a first drawer (29) having a height

corresponding to the spacing between adjacent rails (31), or (b) a second drawer (27)
having a height corresponding to a multiple of the spacing between adjacent rails (31);

and
