<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a laminated steel sheet
used for welded cans such as food cans and, more particularly, a
laminated steel sheet for cans which is easily welded and has a
film structure for preventing decrease in adhesion of
laminated resin film in the can making and filling processes.There are several methods of manufacturing cans: the
soldered can making method, welded can making method, cementing
can making method, draw and ironing can making method, draw and
redraw can making method, etc. The welded can making method uses
simpler equipment than any other methods and can be carried out
by easy and reliable operation. The cans made by this method
have welded portions with high strength, and withstand severe
working. For these reasons, the welded can making method has come
into wide use rapidly.In the soldered can melting or welded can melting methods,
to make a round can, for example, opposed ends of a sheet cut
into a square necessary for the can body are joined, and the
joint is welded by soldering or electric resistance welding. For 
plating of steel sheet for cans for the soldering or welding can
making methods, tin was initially used. In the welded can making
method, however, far less deposit of tin is required than the
soldering can making method, or the deposit of tin is not
required at all, so that thin plating or combined use of other
metal is carried out. From this point of view, the
rationalization of the welded can making method is anticipated.The body and ends of food cans are painted. The painting
includes thick-film painting for enhancing corrosion resistance
of the inner surface of can, painting for protecting the outer
surface, printing, and the like. When painting or printing is
performed, a plated steel sheet is cut into a predetermined size,
and then each piece of sheet is painted, dried, or printed. This
process requires high transportation cost as well as measures
against environmental pollution due to painting. Therefore,
these disadvantages have been some of the problems to be solved
in can making.As the first stage for solving the above problem, what we
call the precoating, in which a plated steel sheet is painted in
advance or a resin film is laminated, was tried. However, the
merely precoated steel sheet had a problem in that the resin film
in the welded area must be removed in welding.So far, a steel strip on which film is laminated in a band
form except for welded area has been proposed for welded cans.
