<ABSTRACT>
A base (socket) (1) comprises, on either side of a joining surface, two complementary parts (3, 4) which define between them a cylindrical housing (6) designed to hold a cylindrical post (2), the said base being widened towards its lower end which forms a support (5), so that it has an overall bell shape extending along the axis of the said post. The base (1) is provided with transverse passages extending parallel on either side of the housing (6) of the post (2) and passing through the joining surface, each of the said passages being designed to receive a screw bearing on one (4) of the complementary parts (3, 4) of the said base and engaging with an internal screw thread made on the other part (3) of the said base. By manipulating these screws, it is then possible to tighten the said parts (3, 4) against one another so as to clamp the post (2) in the housing (6).

Base (1; 101) for holding a pole (2) comprising, on both 
sides of a joint surface (S), two complementary parts (3, 4; 103, 

104) delimiting between them a housing (6; 106) and means (41, 
43) for clamping the said parts against each other in order to 

clasp the said pole in the said housing, characterised in that 
one (3; 103) of the complementary parts (3, 4; 103, 104) of the 

base (1; 101) is fitted on its lower part with a plate (5; 105) 
forming an axial supporting seating for the pole (2) and sole 

plate of the said base, and serving as a bed plate for the other 
part (4; 104) of the said base. 
Base according to claim 1 characterised in that the pole 
(2) and its housing (6; 106) are cylindrical. 
Base according to claim 1 characterised by a cylinder 
(10) serving to assist the installation of the pole in the said 

housing, with the said cylinder being arranged in the centre of 
the sole plate (5) coaxially to the said housing (6) of the pole 

and with the outer diameter of the said cylinder (10) being such 
that the said cylinder is located inside the said pole when the 

latter is in place in the said housing (6). 
Base according to claim 3 characterised in that ribs (11) 
are arranged radially around the said cylinder (10) and become 

wider towards the base of the latter. 
Base according to any one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that it is suitable for attachment to the ground 

by means of a threaded rod (25) extending in line with the axis 
of the pole (2). 
Base according to any one of the preceding claims 

characterised by holes (30) arranged in the part of the sole 
plate (5) serving as a bed plate and suitable for each receiving 

a threaded rod (31) for attaching the base to the ground. 
Base according to any one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that the said base (1) is fitted with transverse 

passages (40) extending in parallel on both sides of the housing 
(6; 106) of the pole (2) and crossing the joint surface (s), with 

each of the said passages being suitable for receiving a screw 
(41) resting on one (4; 104) of the complimentary parts (3, 4;  

 
103, 104) of the said base and engaging with a female thread (43) 

arranged in the other part (4; 104) of the said base. 
Base according to claim 7 characterised in that the 
portions of the transverse passages (40) located in that (3) of 

the complementary parts (3, 4; 103, 104) of the said base (1; 
101) which comprises the said female threads (43) are closed. 
Base according to claim 8 characterised in that each of 
the female threads (43) is comprised of a nut housed with the aid 

of a release (45) which is triggered near the lower end of the 
corresponding closed passage. a compartment (50) which terminates 

on one side below the sole plate (5; 105) and on the other side 
on the said nut housing release, being arranged in the 

corresponding part (3; 103) of the said base. 
Base according to any one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that the joint surface (S) is, relative to an 

axial plane, concave towards one (3; 103) of the complementary 
parts (3, 4; 103, 104) of the base (1), with the lower boundary 

of the said joint surface being a straight line (D1) extending 
diametrically, the projection of the upper boundary of the said 

joint surface on a radial plane forming two straight lines (D2, 
D2') converging towards the said part (3; 103) of the base and 

the intersection of the said joint surface with the housing (6; 
106) of the pole (2) forming two parallel straight lines (D3) 

which are inclined relative to the vertical towards the said part 
(3; 103) of the base. 
Base according to any one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that the said base, flared towards its lower 

part forming a sole plate (5; 105), exhibits the general form of 
a bell which is coaxial to the said pole. 
Base according to any one of claims 1 - 11 characterised 
in that the enveloping surface of the said base (101) is a 

revolving surface whose axis is that of the pole (2) but on which 
two parallel lateral flats (107) are arranged in such a way that 

the sole plate (105) of the said base is of more or less 
rectangular form. 
Base according to any one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that it is mounted at the top of a support (110)  

 
which flares out from a receptacle (111), forming an axial 

supporting seating for the said base (1; 101), towards a sole 
plate (114). 
Base according to any one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that each of the said parts (3, 4; 103, 104) is 

constructed by moulding with axial orientation-simplifying 
recesses opening towards the sole plate face of the base and 

transverse recesses for constructing passages (40) terminating 
laterally on the body of the base.
