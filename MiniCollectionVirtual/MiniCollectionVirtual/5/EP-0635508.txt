<ABSTRACT>
A tetrahydropyridine derivative having substituents on the three rings thereof, represented by general formula (1), and an 
acid addition salt thereof, useful as a psychotropic agent having an antianxiety action and an action of improving learning ability, 

wherein A represents sulfur, or a sulfoxide or sulfone group; R₁ represents an amino group having a specific substituent or 
a specific aliphatic oxy group; R₂ and R₃ represent each hydrogen or hydroxy; and m and n represent each an integer of 0 

to 4, and when both m and n are 2 or above, R₂ and R₃ may be the same with or different from each other, provided that R₃ 
is hydroxy when A is sulfur, R₁ is cyclohexylamino and R₂ is hydrogen, that R₂ is hydrogen and R₃ is hydrogen or hydroxy 

when A is a sulfoxide group and R₁ is cyclohexylamino or 4-hydroxycyclohexylamino, and that R₂ and R₃ are both hydrogen 
when A is a sulfone group and R₁ is cyclohexylamino.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a tetrahydropyridine
derivative having substituents on three rings and represented
by the following formula (1), which affects the central nerve
of mammal and is useful as a psychotropic drug having
antianxiety and learning-improvement effects, and an acid
addition salt thereof.
There have been known that the following compounds
(1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6) and (7) are useful as an
anxiolytic drug and a psychotropic drug.It has been known that a β-carboline-3-carboxylic
acid derivative of the following general formula: 

is useful as a neuroleptic having an antiaggresive action.Also, it has been known that the following
tetrahydropyridine derivatives and pyridine derivatives (2),
(3), (4), (5), (6) and (7) have psychotropic effects.A compound of the following formula:
A compound of the following formula:
A compound of the following formula:
A compound of the following formula:
A compound of the following formula:
A compound of the following formula:

Further, there have been made many studies on the synthesis
of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzo[b]thieno[2,3-c]pyridine or
derivatives thereof as reported, for example, in Gerhard Wolf
and Felix Zymalkowski, Arch. Pharm., 279, 309 (1976)] and
biochemical studies on the effects of these compounds on the
brain, as reported, for example, in Brandley V. Clineschmidt,
Duane R. Reiss, Douglas J. Pettibone and Janet L. Robinson, 
J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 696-708, 235 (3) (1985). However
no such a tetrahydropyridine derivative having substituents
on three rings as the one of the present invention has been
known so far.It is an object of the present invention to provide a
novel tetrahydropyridine derivative having substituents on
three rings which is useful as a drug having antianxiety and
learning-improvement effects.The present inventors have conducted extensive
studies in order to develop such a compound which is a
tetrahydropyridine derivative having substituents on three
rings and shows antianxiety and learning-improvement effects.
As a result, they have successfully found out that a
tetrahydropyridine derivative on three rings having a
specific substituent at the 3-position suits the purpose.
The present invention has been completed based on this
finding.Accordingly, the present invention provides a
tetrahydropyridine derivative having substituents on three
rings and represented by the following formula:
