<ABSTRACT>
A "rod accumulator" riser tensioning cylinder assembly for use with off-shore production and exploratory drilling facilities. The tensioner is basically a hydro-pneumatic spring having a tubular cylinder equipped with a hollow rod containing sufficient volume to act as an accumulator. The rod is internally ported to the annulus of the cylinder. The cylinder exterior is coated with a material that will insulate the unit when exposed to high temperature and flame. A wear sleeve is supplied over the insulation material to provide a low friction surface for an outer, cylindrically shaped rod insulation jacket to slide over the cylinder when the rod is stroked into the cylinder. When the rod is stroked out, the jacket is also extended, protecting the rod from flame and high temperature due to its insulative properties. This is a low mass and low volume system, with low lateral area so that an increased number of such cylinder assemblies can be provided in a given horizontal area.

<DESCRIPTION>
TITLE: ROD ACCUMULATOR RISER TENSIONING CYLINDER ASSEMBLYBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates in general to tensioning of risers used in offshore oil production and exploratory drilling and, more specifically, to an improved riser tensioner assembly for such use.Off shore oil drilling and production operations are conducted through a pipe, called a riser, running from the subsea wellhead to the surface platform or floating vessel. In order to support the weight of these risers and to control the stresses induced by ocean currents and vessel motions, the upper end of the riser is connected to a tensioning device. This riser tensioner maintains a predetermined range of tension throughout the range of vertical and lateral motions of the drilling or production rig.The conventional approach to tensioning risers is to use a combination of a hydraulic or pneumatic mechanical cylinder, pressurized using a compressed gas, to apply the tensioning forces to the riser. Each riser tensioner is located on a deck of the floating platform or floating vessel and structurally connected through its cylinders to the riser. The cylinders may be connected to the risers with wire rope or chain or directly connected through cylinder rods. The pressurized gas volume is typically contained in a separate pressure vessel referred to as an "accumulator", positioned alongside the cylinder, which supplies sufficient gas volume to act as a gas spring. This combination of cylinder and accumulator acts to compress or expand the gas in response to vessel or riser movements, maintaining a relatively uniform tension level in the riser.This traditional approach to riser tensioning using separate cylinders and accumulators acting together has worked satisfactorily in most cases, but is not space efficient. The deck area at the platform or vessel 

required for each riser and its tensioner is significant and maximum utilization of the space on the vessel or platform is economically significant and can limit the number of wells that can be accommodated without enlarging the platform.In addition, safety considerations related to personnel, investment, and ecological considerations have driven regulatory agencies to require protection of critical equipment from destruction by fire. Risers and tensioners have typically been designated as critical components that must continue to remain safe during an accidental fire.Protection of a riser tensioner from fire in the past was generally accomplished by a water deluge system; under new
