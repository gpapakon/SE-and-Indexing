<ABSTRACT>
An ultrashort-wave transceiver having an 
integrated transmitter and receiver for transmitting 

and receiving microwaves or higher frequency 
electromagnetic waves is one of a series of device 

products corresponding to different transmission output 
power capacities. In this invented series of device 

products, an ultrashort-wave transceiver which is of a 
minimum size to meet its transmission output power 

requirement without an amplifier is composed of 
entirely standardized basic components, a transmission 

module, a reception module, and a transmission and 
reception shared circuit which are housed in a heat 

radiating housing case irrespective of different 
transmission output power requirements. Corresponding 

to the transmission output power requirement, a power 
amplifier is added to the basic components. The heat 

radiating housing case which houses the basic 
components and the power amplifier is longer than, but 

has the same cross section as, the heat radiating 
housing case which houses no power amplifier, thereby 

radiating the heat produced by the power amplifier. 
The heat radiating housing case is thus substantially 

standardized.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of producing a series of models of
transceivers
having different transmission output
power capacities.Radio transceivers having an integrated transmitter
and receiver are characterized by small size.
Because radio transceivers are small in size, they may
be positioned close to an antenna or integrally combined
with an antenna, and consequently, the radio
device requires no station buildings or shelters and
hence can be installed at a low cost. The size of such
radio transceivers is an important factor to be considered.
Since the size of a radio transceiver varies
according to the size of a cooling radiator, the size
of the transceiver varies in proportion to the transmission
output power capacities of the transceiver. It
is therefore increasingly important to produce a series 
of models having different transmission output power
capacities.Radio transceivers having an integrated transmitter
and receiver for transmitting and receiving radiowaves
such as microwaves or higher frequency electromagnetic
waves have been available in a series of
models which are operable in the same frequency band
and the same signal processing format and have different
transmission output power capacities. There have
heretofore been three alternative design approaches to
produce such a series of radio transceivers.The first process is to individually design radio
transceivers with different transmission output power
capacities. Generally, the total quantity of heat
generated by a radio transceiver depends greatly on the
output power of a transmission power amplifier thereof.
Therefore, the area of a heat radiating plate and the
size of the device vary in proportion to the magnitude
of the output power of the transmission power amplifier.
According to the first approach, therefore, all
the dimensions including the length, width, and height
of the device housing, and the size of the heat radiating
plate can be designed to optimally meet the output
power requirement of the transmission power amplifier. According to the second design principle (which is no prior art), the
basic device design is carried out with respect to a
type having a highest transmission output power capacity,
and a type having a lower transmission output power
capacity is manufactured by replacing a power amplifier
in the basic type with a simple transmission line.
This design approach allows the use of a device housing
and heat radiating plate of the same sizes in models
having different transmission output power
