<ABSTRACT>
A method is provided for depolymerizing 
scrap aromatic polycarbonate to salvage component 

monomers by initially effecting aromatic polycarbonate 
depolymerization by basic phenolysis to produce a 

mixture having dihydric phenol, and diarylcarbonate. 
Recovery of the dihydric phenol is effected by 

distillation of a crystalline dihydric phenol/phenol 
adduct. Diarylcarbonate is recovered by distillation 

of the resulting mother liquor after carboxylic acid 
treatment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method
for recovering component aromatic polycarbonate
values, such as dihydric phenol and diarylcarbonate
from scrap aromatic polycarbonate. The scrap aromatic
polycarbonate is initially subjected to basic
phenolysis. Dihydric phenol is then recovered as a
dihydric phenol/phenol adduct, and diarylcarbonate is
recovered by distillation of the resulting mother
liquor.Prior to the present invention as shown by
Idel, U.S. Patent 4,212,774, scrap polycarbonate was
saponified in bulk in the presence of an aqueous
alkali metal hydroxide solution to produce bisphenol
A. The resulting mixture was thereafter phosgenated
to produce a polycarbonate. Although polycarbonate
made by Idel exhibited valuable mechanical and
rheological properties, the product was often
contaminated with organic additives which were not
eliminated during the saponification and phosgenation
stages. As a result, the physical properties of the
recycled polycarbonate were often sub-standard. It
would be desirable, therefore, to be able to
depolymerize scrap polycarbonate to allow for the
recovery of basic polymer forming ingredients, such as
readily purifiable bisphenol A and diphenylcarbonate.
These basic ingredients can be converted to
polycarbonate by standard melt-transesterification 
procedures; the resulting polycarbonate has
substantially the same physical properties as virgin
polycarbonate source material.DD-A-45600 discloses a process for the
depolymerisation of aromatic polycarbonates by basic
phenolysis at temperature between 150 and 245°C. The
reaction mixture is then treated with active carbon or
kieselguhr, then with aqueous alkali and acid in order to
separate the diphenyl carbonate, and further, e.g. with a
chlorinated hydrocarbon, to separate the excess phenol
from the dihydric phenol.DE-A-4220412 discloses a process for cleaving
polycarbonates into bisphenols and diaryl carbonates by
transesterifying with phenols in the presence of
catalysts. The process entails isolating bisphenols from
the product of the transesterification, and subjecting
the remaining mixture which contains phenols and diaryl
carbonates to flash distillation. The phenols and diaryl
carbonates are distilled off and separated, and the
diaryl carbonates are recovered.The present invention is based on the
discovery that polycarbonate scrap can be salvaged by
initially depolymerizing the polymer through basic
phenolysis. The scrap can be heated in the presence
of a major amount of phenol and an effective amount of
a basic
