<ABSTRACT>
A compound containing two or more vinyl 
sulfone groups is prepared by dehydrohalogenating the 

corresponding haloethyl sulfone using an alkali metal 
salt of a carboxylic acid to effect the 

dehydrohalogenation. The use of the alkali metal salt 
of a carboxylic acid inhibits the tendency of the 

product vinyl sulfone to hompolymerize during the 
manufacture thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved process 
for the preparation of compounds containing two or more 
vinyl sulfone groups. Compounds containing two or more vinyl 
sulfone groups (hereafter "vinyl sulfones") are well 
known cross-linking agents for hydrophilic colloids, 
such as photographic gelatin. These compounds are 
usually prepared from the corresponding 
haloethylsulfonyl compounds by dehydrohalogenation 
using a strong organic base such as triethylamine. One 
disadvantage that has been observed in making and using 
these vinyl sulfones is that these compounds, 
particularly the more active ones, such as bis-(vinylsulfonyl)methane 
(BVSM), will readily 
homopolymerize in the presence of a strong base. In 
U.S. Patent 4,171,976 to D.M. Burness et al it is 
disclosed that homopolymerization inhibitors, such as 
3,5-dinitrobenzoic acid, can be used to prevent 
homopolymerization of the vinyl sulfones. However, 
even with such inhibitors, vinyl sulfones readily 
polymerize so that in the process of making a vinyl 
sulfone with a strong base, such as triethylamine, 
careful handling is required to prevent the presence of 
too much base. It is not easy to determine the exact 
stoichiometry in this process particularly because the 
quality of the precursor is variable and there is no 
good analytical method available for it. This results 
in commercial processes which are complicated and 
tedious and give unpredictable yields.  
 This invention solves the problem of 
undesired homopolymerization of a compound having two 
or more vinyl sulfone groups during the manufacture 
thereof. This invention comprises a method of 
preparing a compound of the formula: 
(CH2=CH-SO2)n-Z 
by reacting a compound of the formula: 
(CHX-CH2-SO2)n-Z 
where X is a halogen atom, Z is an organic radical 
having a valence of n and n is 2-6, in the presence of 
an alkali metal salt of a carboxylic acid. Use of the 
alkali metal salt of a carboxylic acid in the 
dehydrohalogenation reaction inhibits the tendency of 
the vinyl sulfone to homopolymerize during the 
manufacture thereof. The use of a weak base, such as an alkali 
metal salt of a carboxylic acid, provides an 
appropriate environment for the process since the by-product 
carboxylic acid acts as a buffer. In other 
words, even with excess of base, the reaction medium 
does not go over a certain pH because of carboxylic 
acid formed as by-product. Therefore, a small excess 
of base can be used to complete the reaction without 
having any danger of homopolymerization.
