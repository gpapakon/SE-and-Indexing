nozzle-rotating motor for rotating the adsorptive nozzle 

within a plane being perpendicular to an axis of the adsorptive

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an automatic electronic 
parts-mounting apparatus for taking electronic parts 
out of a parts feeder by use of a sucking nozzle and 
determining an angular position of the electronic parts by the 
rotation of the sucking nozzle to mount them on a printed 
substrate. As a conventional technique for automatically and 
continuously mounting electronic parts on a printed substrate 
during manufacturing processes, chip-like parts being supplied 
one by one from a parts feeder or the like are sucked by a 
sucking nozzle composed of a vacuum pump and magnets 
etc., so as to be mounted at predetermined positions on the 
printed substrate. The chip-like electronic parts from the 
parts feeder are regularly transferred through, for example, a 
guide channel. However, there is an unavoidable slight deviation 
between the central axis and the feeding-out direction 
of the electronic parts. Due to this deviation, there 
arises such problems that the electronic parts cannot be mounted 
at precise positions on the printed substrate even if they 
have been adsorbed in a constant state by the sucking 
nozzle, and that they could interfere with other electronic 
parts thereon. Therefore, in an automatic electronic parts-mounting 
apparatus as disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. Hei 3-52299,  
 
a sucking nozzle takes the electronic parts out of 
a parts feeder by sucking in a sucking station, and a 
recognizing device recognizes the positional deviation of the 
electronic parts. Based on the recognized result, a nozzle 
rotation-positioning device rotates the sucking nozzle to 
determine the angular position. The electronic parts are then 
mounted on the printed substrate in a parts-mounting station. 
The nozzle rotation-positioning device does not move relatively 
to a rotary disc for moving the nozzle between the aforementioned 
stations. Namely, after the nozzle comes to and 
stops at the front of the positioning device by rotation, the 
positioning device rotates the nozzle to make a fine adjustment. According to such a conventional technique, however, 
the sucking nozzle stops at a position of the positioning 
device for fine adjustment by its rotation, which would require 
a certain time for completion of the stopping action, 
thereby undesirably increasing the production time for mounting 
the electronic parts. Meanwhile, if it is intended to 
reduce the stopping time, this would make it difficult to 
perform the positioning precisely. To cope with such a problem, there is
