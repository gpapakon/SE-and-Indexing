<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides an improved process for 
selectively producing acetic acid and/or methyl acetate by the 

gas phase carbonylation of methanol with carbon monoxide; an 
improved process for producing acetic anhydride directly from 

the methyl acetate; and a novel method for sustaining the life 
time of a carbonylation or a hydroformylation catalyst by 

pretreating the carbon monoxide or the synthesis gas to be 
used in carrying out the gas phase carbonylation or the 

hydroformylation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
selectively preparing acetic acid by
carbonylating methanol with carbon monoxide.Acetic acid and acetic anhydride have long been used as
basic chemicals for industrial purposes such as solvents, raw 
materials and intermeidates for various reaction products.Acetic acid has been traditionally produced by oxidation
of ethanol or acetaldehyde prepared by Wacker process starting
from ethylene or low boiling raffinates produced in a
petroleum process. These oxidation processes are being
replaced by a carbonylation process which reacts methanol with
carbon monoxide employing a rhodium catalyst in the presence
of methyl iodide in liquid phase. However, the liquid phase
carbonylation process has been found to have various critical
deficiencies including the continuous loss of the expensive
catalyst and the high corrosion problem stemming from the
liquid phase reaction mixture which entail extremely high
construction, maintenance and production costs. In order to overcome the various problems associated with
the liquid phase carbonylation of methanol to produce acetic
acid, therefore, various proposals have been made to provide
a process for producing acetic acid in a gas phase. For
example, the processes disclosed in European Patent
Publication No. 0 069 514 A2 assigned to Toyo Engineering
Corporation, German DE 33 23 654, and Ind. Chem. Prod., Res.
Dev., 22, 436(1983) and Chemistry Letters, 895(1987) relate to
the gas phase production of acetic acid by a nickel-catalyzed
carbonylation of methanol; however, none of these processes
has proven to be commercially viable due to various problems.European Patent Publication No. 0 335 625 A2 provides a
process for producing acetic acid by employing a nickel/rhodium
catalyst supported on active carbon at 188°C. In this
process, a mixture of CO/H2(1:2) gas is introduced under a
pressure of 9 atm, with the ratio of methanol to methyl iodide
being 100:19.1 and the LHSV of the feed being 1. However,
this process results in a low yield of 9.7%. In addition,
nickel is apt to be vaporized from the catalyst beds during
the reaction, thereby shortening the life time of the
catalyst.U.S. Patent Nos. 3,717,670(to Hockman) and 3,689,533 (to
Schultz) offer processes for producing acetic acid in a
heterogeneous gas phase using a rhodium catalyst. These
patents teach that the conversion of methanol and the yield of 
acetic acid may be improved by mixing the Rh catalyst with a
metallic component. However, according to these patents, the

<CLAIMS>
A process for the selective production of acetic
acid, which comprises:


a) pretreating carbon monoxide containing metallic
carbonyl compounds by feeding it into a purification

column wherein iodine is introduced in a molar amount
ranging from 0.1 to 1000 times the metallic content

in the feed gas and which is maintained at a
temperature to allow the metallic carbonyl impurities

to react completely with the iodine gas, sending the
metallic iodides formed to an adsorbent column and

allowing the metallic iodides to be adsorbed onto the
adsorbent therein;
b) carbonylating methanol in a gas phase with said
pretreated carbon monoxide in a carbonylation

reactor, said carbon monoxide being optionally in
admixture of hydrogen, in the presence of a rhodium

catalyst comprised of a rhodium compound and a second
metallic component selected from the group consisting

of an alkali metal, an alkaline earth metal, Co and a
mixture thereof, and supported on an inert material,

and a halide co-catalyst at a temperature ranging
from 200°C to 280°C, a pressure ranging from 10 to 20

atm and a methanol GHSV ranging from 300 to 5000 hr
-1

to provide a product mixture composed of acetic acid
in a major amount and methyl acetate in a minor

amount;
c) separating said methyl acetate in the minor amount
and the co-catalyst from the product mixture and

recycling the separated methyl acetate and the co-catalyst
to the carbonylation reactor;and 
d) recovering from the product mixture said acetic acid
in the major amount.
