<ABSTRACT>
A metal element (1) adapted for securing another element (2) in a through going hole, said hole diverging from its middle portion towards both ends. The second element (2) is placed in the hole and deformed into contact with the hole surface, substantially by being pressed axially. A method of making such ajoint between a metal element and another element consists of making the hole such that it diverges from its middle portion towards both ends, placing the other element, which is mainly cylindrical in its forward end, having there a diameter being substantially equal to the smallest diameter in the hole, in the hole and pressing the other element axially in such a manner that it is deformed into contact with the hole surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
 A metal element adapted for securing another element in a hole therethrough and a method of making such a joint.The present invention relates to a metal element adapted for securing another element in a through going hole in the metal element. Moreover, the invention relates to a method of making such a joint.More specifically the invention relates to the joining of two elements, of which at least one is a metal element, for inst- anse of light metal'. The invention may be applied in a number of technical fields, but a particular application is in cases where the two elements are subjected to repeated loading, in such a manner that it represents a problem how to avoid that the elements are separated or loosened from each other.As an example of such a joint is mentioned a steel bolt attached in a hole for instance in a rod and subjected to transverse forces, i.e. bending and/or shear, which, causes compressive strains between the 'bolt and the hole, If the rod is made of steel, it is normally not a severe problem to avoid that the surface of the hole does not withstand the strains, but if the rod is of metal the problem is worse because of the different mechanicalproperties, as for instance less material strength of the metal.A known principle for the solution of this problem is to pro¬ vide a bushing in the hole, for instance a steel bushing which is pressed into place. The bushing may be provided with an abutment collar in one end. Experience has, however, shown that the bushing may overload the surface in the hole. in the same manner as a steel rod. Moreover, temperature changes may lead to a clearance between the bushing and the hole surface, because of mutually different temperature coefficents for the metal and the steel. This is particularly a problem when the metal is a light metal or light metal alloy having a*-large temperature coefficient. 

 The main object of the present invention is to achieve an improvement of the above circumstances.In accordance with the invention this is achieved with a metal element and a method, respectively, as defined in the succeeding patent claims.Because the hole diverges, for instance conically, towards the ends, a favourable distribution of the stresses iϊ , achieved. When the second element, i.e. the element attached in the hole through the metal element, is subjected to bend¬ ing and/or shear, the hole surface will be 'subjected to forces which increase towards the hole ends. In the end areas of the hole the circumference of the hole, however, is largest,
