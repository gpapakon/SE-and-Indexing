<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to an airbag safety 
system and more particulary to a locking means for a 
connector of an airbag restraint system. The invention 
further relates specifically to the design of a connector 
assembly between an ignition cable and an igniter. This 
invention further relates to an ignition cable connector 
as well as to a so-called apparatus connector associated 
with the igniter. German Patent 28 30 552 with the title "Safety means 
against short circuiting of an electric ignition means" 
should be noted. It is already known to provide a releasable connector 
assembly between an ignition cable of an ignition control 
means and an airbag restraint or safety apparatus 
comprising an igniter. As is known, the igniter is used 
for igniting a gas generating charge (within said 
restraint apparatus) which, in turn, causes the 
deployment of the airbag (gas bag). Typically, the 
ignition of the igniter is caused by an electrical 
ignition signal which is supplied to the igniter from 
said ignition control means via said ignition cable. 
Thus, the ignition cable is connected to said ignition 
control means which generates the ignition signal in case 
the deployment of the airbag is required.  Commonly, the ignition cable leading to the restraint 
apparatus comprising the igniter is provided with an 
ignition cable connector preferably of the plug-type 
which can be coupled or plugged into an apparatus 
connector preferably of the jack or socket-type in a 
releasable manner. Said apparatus connector forms part of 
said restraint apparatus and of a unit therof which might 
be referred to as an ignition generator. Generally 
speaking, the igniter and said apparatus connector are 
commonly arranged in a housing (ignitor support) of said 
ignition generator. Below, referring to Figs. 1 through 9 a known ignition 
cable connector as well as a known ignition generator 
will be described together with a respective apparatus 
connector. It is already known to provide within the apparatus 
connector a so-called short circuit bridge means, so as 
to avoid an unintentional ignition of the ignition 
generator at a point in time where there is not yet 
provided the proper connection with the ignition cable 
connector. Said short circuit bridge means is adapted to 
provide a short circuit for the contact pins (there are 
generally two pins) of the apparatus connector of the 
ignition generator at a time when the ignition cable 
connector is not yet in engagement with the apparatus 
connector.

<CLAIMS>
An ignition cable connector (30, 70) adapted to engage 
with an apparatus connector (31) of an ignition generator 

(14) to form a connector assembly, said ignition cable 
connector comprising: 

an insulating body (3, 4; 32, 33; 320, 330); 
a nose (35; 335); and 

locking means (36, 37) spaced from said nose (35), 
said locking means being adapted to come into engagement 

with counter locking means (38) provided at the apparatus 
connector (31). 
An ignition cable connector of claim 1, wherein said 
locking means are provided in the form of hooks (36, 37). 
An ignition cable connector of claim 1, wherein the 
locking means are provided in the form of resiliently 

pivotable hooks (36, 37). 
An ignition cable connector according to claim 2, 
wherein said hooks are integrally formed, with said 

insulating body. 
An ignition cable connector according to claim 4, 
wherein said insulating body comprises an insulating body 

lower part to which said hooks (36, 37) are connected by 
means of arms which extend substantially parallel to said 

nose (35) thus forming a recess (41), in said insulating 
body. 
An ignition cable connector according to claim 1, 
wherein the insulating body forms an ignition cable 

connector bottom (94) adapted to abut the upper surface 
(96) of the apparatus connector (31) when the connector 

assembly is established. 
An ignition cable connector according to claim 1, 
wherein said nose comprises at its free or lower end 

pressure point cam means (60) adapted to cooperate with 
cam means (27, 28) of an insulating body (26) of the 

apparatus connector such that push effect generating 
means are formed, 

said push effect generating means making sure that short 
circuit contact arms (24, 25) provided in the apparatus 

connector will be disengaged from contacting contact pins 
provided in the apparatus connector (31) only if the 

locking of the ignition cable connector (30, 70) at the 
apparatus connector (31) is secured by means of said 

locking means (36, 37). 
An ignition cable connector according to claim 7, 
wherein said cam means are formed by two oppositely 

located cam projections (60). 
An ignition cable connector according to claim 1, 
wherein openings are provided in the ignition cable 

connector (30, 70) for the insertion of a de-locking tool 
(80) such that the inserted de-locking tool (80) will 

resiliently release the locking means (36, 37) and the 
ignition cable connector can be pulled out of the 

apparatus connector (31). 
An ignition cable connector according to claim 7, 
wherein the design is such that between pressure point 

cam (60) at the nose (35) and the pressure point cams 
(27) at the inner surface of the insulating body (26) a 

play or a distance (63) is provided in the locked 
condition of the ignition cable connector.
