<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for explantation of an electrode, in particular of an intravascularly or intracardially implanted electrode, with an electrode cable and an electrode head which is preferably fitted on the distal end of the electrode cable. In order to obtain a device for explantation of an electrode in which the device can free the surface of the electrode cable and the electrode head very simply and reliably from fibrous tissue it is proposed, according to the invention, that the device comprise a first sleeve (1) which is relatively short and rigid in comparison to the length of the electrode cable (8) and whose internal diameter is slightly larger than the external diameter of the electrode cable (8). One end of the sleeve (1) forms a blade (2) and the sleeve (1) is connected to first control means (3), which face away from the blade (2), in the form of a mandrin by means of which the sleeve (1) can be displaced along the implanted electrode.

<CLAIMS>
Arrangement for explanting an implanted
electrode device (7) comprising an electrode device (7)

which is applied intravascularly or inside the heart
and has an electrode cable (8) of a certain length and

outside diameter and an electrode head (9), which is
mounted on the distal end of the electrode cable,

wherein the arrangement comprises a stiff first sleeve
(1) which is relatively short in comparison with the

length of the electrode cable (8), the inside diameter
of which first sleeve is slightly greater than the

outside diameter of the electrode cable (8), wherein
one end face of the sleeve (1) forms a cutting edge (2)

and wherein the sleeve (1) is securely connected to
first control means (3) in the form of a mandrin that

face away from the cutting edge (2), with the aid of
which control means the sleeve (1) can be slid on to

the electrode cable (8) and moved along the implanted
electrode device (7).
Arrangement according to claim 1,
characterised in that the control means (3) consist of

stainless steel.
Arrangement according to claim 1 or 2,
characterised by a second sleeve (4) which can be slid

on to the first sleeve (1), wherein one end face of the
second sleeve (4) is provided with spring-mounted

cutting means (5) which are pre-bent in such a way that
in a first position the said cutting means rest against

the outside wall of the first sleeve (1) and in a
second position are pressed against each other, wherein

the second sleeve (4) is connected to second control
means (6) that face away from the cutting means (5),

with the aid of which control means the second sleeve
(4) can be moved along the first sleeve (1), so that

the cutting means (5) can be moved from one position
into the other position. 
Arrangement according to claim 3,
characterised in that the cutting means (5) are

distributed evenly over the circumference of the second
sleeve (4).
Arrangement according to claim 3 or 4,
characterised in that the second control means (6) are

formed from a tube.
Arrangement according to one of claims 3 to 5,
characterised in that at least one sleeve (1, 4)

consists of metal.
