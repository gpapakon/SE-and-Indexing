<ABSTRACT>
Transmitter station (1-5) for transmitting, and 
receiver (6-20) for receiving a plurality 

of television programs 
via
 respective 
transmission channels. A teletext page with tuning 

data (F) which are representative of the 
transmission channels used by the transmitter 

station (1-5) is transmitted (4-5) by means of one 
of the programs, for example a local television 

program. Moreover, further signal processing 
data are incorporated in the teletext page, 

which data are representative of the transmitted 
television programs, such as a station 

name (NAM), a system code (S) and a predetermined 
teletext page number (PDC). 

When the television receiver (6-20) is tuned to a 
television program, the respective signal 

processing circuits are controlled by means 
of the corresponding signal processing data.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a transmitter station for transmitting a plurality of
television programs via respective transmission channels, comprising a data generator
adapted to transmit tuning data in the television signal of one of the television
programs, which tuning data are representative of the transmission channels used by the
transmitter station. The invention also relates to a television receiver for receiving
television signals from such a transmitter station.A transmitter station of the type mentioned in the opening paragraph is
described in European Patent Application EP 0 263 555. The transmitter station is
notably applicable in cable television systems in which the cable network manager takes
care of the distribution of television programs. As described in this Patent Application,
the cable television transmitter station transmits, simultaneously with at least one of the
television programs, a teletext page in which the tuning data of the available programs
and corresponding preset numbers are stated. The tuning data represent the transmitter
frequency or the channel number through which the plurality of television programs is
transmitted.In an automatic installation procedure which can be carried out by
television receivers the tuning data are received and stored in a tuning memory of the
receiver at memory locations which correspond to the preset numbers. After execution
of such an installation procedure, the television receiver is programmed, i.e. a preset
number has been allocated to each receivable television program. The receiver can now
be tuned by means of preset keys. The installation procedure is a very user-friendly
operation, on the one hand because it is carried out fully automatically, on the other
hand because the preset numbers are allocated to the receivable television programs by
the local cable network manager and will generally satisfy the user's wishes. In practice, the tuning data are transmitted along with the television signal of a
local television program generated by the cable network manager. Practically all cable
networks transmit such a program in the form of a cable newspaper, a mosaic image or the
like. As described in said Patent Application, the transmission may be effected via a teletext
page intended for this purpose.It is an object of the invention to improve the installation procedure and provide
further useful facilities for a user-friendly operation of television receivers.To this end the television transmission station according to the invention is

<CLAIMS>
A transmitter station for transmitting a plurality of television programs 
via

respective transmission channels, comprising a data generator (52) adapted to transmit tuning
data (F) in the television signal of one of the television programs, which tuning data are

representative of the transmission channels used by the transmitter station, characterized in
that the data generator (52) is adapted to further transmit for each channel a code (S)

indicating the television standard at which the respective television programs are transmitted
via said channel.
A receiver of television signals, comprising:

a tuner (7) for tuning to television programs,
a decoder (14) for receiving and storing data which are transmitted along with
television programs, 
inter alia
 tuning data which are transmitted in the television signal of one
of the television programs and are representative of the receivable television programs,
a tuning memory (17) for storing the tuning data in respective memory
locations,
a control circuit (15) coupled to said tuner, decoder and tuning memory and
adapted to receive said tuning data and store them in the tuning memory,

characterized in that the control circuit is adapted to receive codes (S) which are transmitted in
said television signal, and store them in the tuning memory (17), the codes indicating the

television standard at which the receivable television programs are transmitted, the control
circuit being adapted to demodulate the received television signal when the receiver is tuned to

a television program and to display said signal in conformity with the television standard
which is represented by the code stored for said program.
