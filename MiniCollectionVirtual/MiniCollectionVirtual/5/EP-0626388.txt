14α-hydroxy-4-androstene-3,6,17-trione having a 

biological activity of human placenta-originating 
estrodiene synthesis enzyme inhibitory action. These 

hydrate crystals include two kinds of 14α-hydroxy-4-androstene-3,6,17-trione 
hydrate crystals having a 

diffraction pattern having characteristic peaks at 
diffraction angles in crystalline powder X-ray 

diffraction. Processes for producing these hydrate 
crystals are also provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to 14α-hydroxy-4-androstene-3,6,17-trione 
hydrate crystals and a 
process for producing the same. 14α-hydroxy-4-androstene-3,6,17-trione has a 
biological activity of human placenta-originating 
estrodiene synthesis enzyme inhibiting action and 
development thereof as an anticancer medicine has been 
expected. 14α-hydroxy-4-androstene-3,6,17-trione is a 
known compound and can be synthesized, for example, by 
the process disclosed in Japanese Patent Kokoku No. 
1-32236 (EP-A 300062). According to this process, 
6β,14α-dihydroxy-4-androstene-3,17-dione is dissolved in 
chloroform and an oxidizing agent is added to the solution 
to carry out the reaction. After completion of the 
reaction, the reaction mixture is filtrated to remove 
the oxidizing agent and the residue is sufficiently 
washed. Then, the solvent is removed to obtain a crude 
fraction. This fraction is dissolved in a small amount 
of chloroform or methanol and the solution is subjected 
to high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to 
elute and isolate 14α-hydroxy-4-androstene-3,6,17-trione. The 14α-hydroxy-4-androstene-3,6,17-trione is  
 
obtained as a crystal by distilling off the solvent from 
the organic solvent solution. The above patent publication 
mentions that thus obtained crystal is white, but 
strictly speaking this is yellow. The 14α-hydroxy-4-androstene-3,6,17-trione 
which is first obtained in the form of an organic 
solvent solution and finally obtained by distilling off 
the solvent from the organic solvent solution is an 
anhydride crystal which has hygroscopicity and which 
changes its color upon absorption of water. Therefore, 
the compound is difficult to handle in the formulation 
step and is not suitable as preparations for medicines. That is, the 14α-hydroxy-4-androstene-3,6,17-trione 
anhydride crystal (hereinafter referred to 
as "α-type crystal") readily absorbs water during 
storage or formulation and increases in its weight and 
changes to slightly yellowish white in its color. 
Therefore, when the α-type crystal is used, there occur 
errors in weighing, unevenness in the color of medicines 
prepared therefrom and differences in the color of 
respective lots of preparations. Thus, it is difficult 
to obtain medicines of uniform quality. Accordingly, 
the object of the present invention is to provide 14α-hydroxy-4-androstene-3,6,17-trione 
suitable as starting 
preparations for medicines. As a result of intensive research conducted by  
 
the inventors, it has been found that
