<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a novel mycoplasma isolated from the urine of patients with AIDS. The mycoplasma has unique morphological and pathobiological properties. The invention also relates to the antigens and antibodies of the novel mycoplasma, and methods of detection utilizing these antigens and antibodies. Antigenically and genetically, the mycoplasma is distinct from all other known mycoplasmas. The invention further relates to the DNA sequence of the novel mycoplasma and vaccines against the mycoplasma infection.

<DESCRIPTION>
TITLE OF THE INVENTIONNOVEL ADHERENT AND INVASIVE MYCOPLASMABACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the InventionThe present invention relates to a novel strain of mycoplasma isolated from a patient with AIDS. The mycoplasma does not appear to be related to any other species of human or animal mycoplasma. This novel mycoplasma is referred to hereinafter as M. penetrans.The invention also relates to use of the mycoplasma M. penetrans in detecting specific antibodies in sera of patients with AIDS or sub-acute and acute fulminant systemic disease and/or animals and its use as a vaccine against infection by the mycoplasma. The invention further relates to M. penetrans-specific antibodies and cross-reactive M. penetrans antibodies (i.e. antibodies to homologous antigenic determinants), including monoclonal antibodies of each, which are useful in detecting M. penetrans antigens in infected tissue of patients or animals. The invention also relates to V _ penetrans DNA probes which are useful in detecting M. penetrans genetic materials in infected tissues, blood or body fluids of patients or animals. M. penetrans genetic materials may also be detected in infected humans or animals by using M. penetrans DNA sequences or a homologous M. penetrans DNA sequence and the polymerase chain reaction ("PCR") (United States Patent No. 4,683,202 incorporated herein by reference) .The ability to monitor AIDS or other acute fulminant systemic disease status can be of great value. In addition to improving prognostication, knowledge of the disease status allows the attending 

 -2-physician to select the most appropriate therapy for the individual patient, e.g. highly aggressive or less aggressive therapy regimens. Because of patient distress caused by more aggressive therapy regimens, it is desirable to distinguish those patients requiring such therapies.Mycoplasma is a genus of cell wall-less sterol-requiring, catalase-negative pathogens commonly found in the respiratory and urogenital tracts of man and other animals. The cells of Mycoplasma are typically non-motile and pleomorphic, ranging from spherical, ovoid or pear-shaped to branched filamentous forms. Filaments are the typical forms in young cultures under optimal conditions, which subsequently transform into chains of coccoid cells which later break up into individual cells that are capable of passing through membrane filters of pore size 0.45 μm or even 0.22 μm.A trilaminar cytoplasmic membrane contains sterols, phospholipid and proteins. Therefore, the cells are
