<ABSTRACT>
A method for etching metal conductors and stacks of conductors is 
disclosed. A silicon dioxide layer doped with phosphorous (e.g.15) is 

deposited upon a metal (e.g.13) or stack of conductive layers to be 
etched. Next the silicon dioxide layer (e.g.15) is partially etched and 

the photoresist removed. Subsequent etching utilizes the raised feature 
created in silicon dioxide layer (e.g.15) as a mask to etch the 

underlying metal (e.g.13) or stack of conductors.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to semiconductor integrated circuits and methods
for their fabrication.Typical integrated circuits often include conductive runners which
connect individual transistors to each other. The conductors are often formed by
depositing a blanket layer of conductive material such as aluminum upon a dielectric
substrate. A patterned photoresist is formed on top of the conductive material. The
patterned photoresist is used as a mask for the subsequent anisotropic etching of the
conductive material. Many times, several layers of conductive material are etched
sequentially to form a multi-layered conductor. However, linewidth control and
pattern sensitivity are problems frequently encountered in etching several layers of
conductive material.The document EP-A-0 564 848 discloses
a process of forming trench capacitors using
raised features of silicon nitride as a mask
for the subsequent etching of a polysilicon layer.
In that process however a photoresist layer is
maintained during etching the polysilicon layer.According to the present invention there is provided
a method as defined in claim 1.The above-mentioned problems are alleviated by the inventive method
which illustratively includes:
forming at least one conductive layer overlying a substrate; forming a material layer overlying the conductive layer; forming a patterned photoresist upon the material layer; using the patterned photoresist as a first mask, etching at least partially
through the material layer, thereby forming a raised feature; removing the photoresist;using the raised feature as a mask, etching the conductive layer, thereby
forming a raised conductive feature on the substrate, and then removing the raised
feature.FIGS. 1-5 are cross-sectional views of a portion of an integrated circuit
having an illustrative embodiment of the present invention.In FIG. 1, reference numeral 11 denotes a substrate which may typically
be a dielectric. Often, substrate 11 is an oxide of silicon or a silicon oxynitride. In
general, the term substrate refers to a body or layer upon which other bodies or
layers may be formed. Dielectric 11 may cover a plurality of transistors formed in a
silicon substrate.  Reference numeral 13 denotes a metallic layer which may, illustratively,
be aluminum, copper or tungsten, as will be further explained below. A multiplicity
of conductive, barrier and anti-reflective layers may be substituted for layer 13.Reference numeral 15 denotes a material which may,
illustratively, be formed by a plasma-enhanced TEOS
