<ABSTRACT>
A layered material such as a packaging laminate for a packaging container possessing superior oxygen gas and aroma barrier properties is disclosed. The packaging laminate comprises a first laminate unit (10a) and a second laminate unit (10b) which are bonded together by the intermediary of an interjacent layer of an adhesive (11). The first laminate unit has a rigid, but foldable core layer (12) and outer, surrounding layers (13, 14) of thermoplastic, and the second laminate unit has a flexible substrate or carrier layer (15) of thermoplastic which, on its surface, carries a layer (16) acting as an oxygen gas and aroma barrier and consisting of a silicon oxide deposited by chemical plasma deposition and having the general chemical formula SiOx, in which x may vary within the range of between 1.5 and 2.2. A flexible laminate having an SiOx barrier layer is also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
PACKAGING LAMINATE WITH GAS AND AROMA BARRIER PROPERTIES TECHNICAL FIELDThe present invention relates to packaging laminates, and more specifically to laminates for packaging food products that have improved barrier properties. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONFlexible packaging laminates have been used for many years for packaging food products. For example, milk has been packaged in cartons made from a laminate of paperboard with a coating of polyethylene on both sides so that the surfaces of the carton can be heat-sealed together to form a carton of the desired shape. Some food products, such as orange juice, lose their nutritional value due to the penetration of oxygen through the wall of the carton. To reduce the penetration of oxygen into the carton and to minimize the degradation of nutrients such as vitamin C, it has been common to add a layer of aluminum foil to the laminate. Although aluminum foil is effective as a barrier material, its use raises environmental concerns. Various attempts have been made to develop practical alternatives to aluminum foil that have superior oxygen, gas and aroma barrier properties, and yet are readily disposable after use.In the process of packaging food products, a carton blank may be folded along one or more crease lines to allow the carton to be properly shaped and to form overlapping portions of the packaging material to form a seal either by the application of a suitable adhesive, or by heat-sealing thermoplastic layers together. Creasing of the .laminate imposes stresses on the laminate which may be sufficiently great to cause leakage, or may

OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONIn view of the deficiencies of prior barrier laminates, it is an object of this invention to provide a packaging laminate that has superior barrier properties.It is a further object of this invention to provide a packaging laminate that is flexible and readily capable of being formed into packages using conventional packaging machines.A further object is to provide a packaging laminate that may be readily disposed of without harm to the environment.These objects are accomplished by a laminate having a substrate on which a layer of silicon oxide is applied by chemical plasma deposition. The silicon oxide that is deposited has the general formula SiOÏ‡/ in which x is within the range of between 1.5 and 2.2.Plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) is a known
