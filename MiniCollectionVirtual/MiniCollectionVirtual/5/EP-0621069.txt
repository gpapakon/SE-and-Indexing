<ABSTRACT>
A process is set forth for using an oxygen selective adsorbent to 
produce 99+% oxygen from air in a single stage operation. The process 

comprises the steps of (a) adsorption of oxygen from air in an adsorption 
zone, (b) oxygen rinse to purge the adsorption zone of impurities 

consisting primarily of nitrogen, (c) depressurization of the adsorption 
zone to produce the 99+% oxygen and (d) repressurization of the adsorption 

zone with nitrogen-enriched gas.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an adsorption process which uses an 
oxygen selective adsorbent to produce 99+% oxygen from air in a single 
stage operation. Adsorption processes which produce oxygen from air typically rely on 
selective physical adsorption (equilibrium based) of nitrogen over oxygen 
on a zeolite based adsorbent. The oxygen product is recovered as that 
portion of the feed air which passes through the adsorption zone. A state 
of the art example is the process taught in US Patent 4,756,723 by Sircar. 
Unfortunately, however, the nitrogen selective adsorbents used in these 
processes generally do not also adsorb argon. Since the ratio of oxygen to 
argon in ambient air is approximately 20:1, this limits the maximum 
attainable purity of the oxygen product stream in a single stage operation 
to approximately 95%, even assuming complete nitrogen removal. A higher 
purity would require further processing in a second stage of operation 
which is typically accomplished by selective physical adsorption (kinetic 
based) of oxygen over argon/nitrogen on a carbon based adsorbent. More recently, a new class of adsorbents have been developed for air 
fractionation which rely on selective chemical adsorption (chemisorption) 
of oxygen over nitrogen and argon. Such oxygen selective adsorbents, which 
are typically cobalt based, exploit the fact that adsorbing the oxygen vis-a-vis 
the nitrogen component of air rather is inherently more efficient to 
the extent that oxygen accounts for only 21% of air while nitrogen accounts 
for 78% of air. See for example US Patent 5,141,725 by Ramprasad et al and 
US Patent 4,477,418 by Mullhaupt et al. When using oxygen selective 
adsorbents to fractionate air, the oxygen product is recovered during 
depressurization of the adsorption zone. For example, see Japanese patent 
application No. 4-161214. Unfortunately, however, the adsorption zone will 
also contain co-adsorbed and/or void space impurities (primarily nitrogen) 
which reduces the purity of the oxygen product. The present invention 
overcomes this problem and produces a 99+% oxygen product by rinsing the 
adsorption zone with essentially pure oxygen prior to the depressurization  
 
step in order to purge from the adsorption zone any co-adsorbed or void 
space impurities. Rinsing the adsorption zone with the more adsorbable component prior 
to depressurization is taught in the art. See for example US Patent 
4,077,779 and published European application 0 913 716 (both by Sircar et 
al) in the context

<CLAIMS>
1. A process to produce 99+% oxygen from air in a single stage 
operation comprising the steps of: 


(a) passing a feed air stream through an adsorption zone containing 
an oxygen selective adsorbent to produce an oxygen saturated adsorption 

zone and a nitrogen-enriched effluent stream; 
(b) rinsing the adsorption zone with essentially pure oxygen in 
order to purge from the adsorption zone any co-adsorbed or void space 

impurities; 
(c) depressurizing the adsorption zone to produce an effluent 
stream containing said 99+% oxygen; 
(d) repressurizing the adsorption zone with nitrogen-enriched gas. 
2. The process of Claim 1 wherein steps (a) through (d) are 
performed as a continually repeating cycle of steps and are effected in a 

system comprising a plurality of adsorption zones which each undergo their 
respective cycle of steps while collectively operated sequentially in 

parallel with one another. 
4. The process of Claim 3 wherein: a portion of the nitrogen-enriched 
effluent stream produced in step (a) is used for repressurizing a 

parallel adsorption zone; at least a portion of the rinse effluent produced 
in step (b) is recycled to the feed air; and a portion of the 99+% oxygen 

produced in step (c) is used for rinsing a parallel adsorption zone. 
5. The process of Claim 1 wherein: steps (a) and (b) are conducted 
at near ambient pressure; step (c) reduces the pressure of the adsorption 

zone to approximately 0.08-0.3 atmospheres; and step (d) returns the 
pressure of the adsorption zone to near ambient pressure. 
6. The method of Claim 1 wherein the adsorption zone contains an 
initial layer of a desiccant material in order to dry the air before it 

reaches the oxygen selective adsorbent.
