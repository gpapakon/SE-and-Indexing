<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel
photochromic compounds.More particularly, the present invention relates
to photochromic compounds belonging to the class of
spiro-pyrans, to the process for preparing them and to
their use in polymeric materials.The photochromic compounds are substances which
display the characteristic of reversibly changing in
colour and/or light transmission degree, when they are
exposed to some type of electromagnetic radiations and
to sun light, returning back to their initial colour
and transmission state when the initial light source
is removed.The known substances displaying photochromic
characteristics are many and belong to different
classes of either organic or inorganic compounds such
as, e.g., those described in "Photochromism, by G. H.
Brown (Ed.), Volume III of Weissberger "Techniques of
Organic Chemistry" Series, Wiley Interscience, New
York (1971) and in "Photochromism: Molecules and
Systems", by H. DÃœrr and H. Bouas-Laurent (Ed.),
Volume 40 of "Studies in Organic Chemistry" Series,
Elsevier (1990).Among the organic photochromic compounds, those
belonging to the classes of spiro-indolino-oxazines, of spiro-pyrans
and of chromenes are particularly known.Said compounds are capable of giving
photochromic characteristics to polymerized organic 
materials, used as photochromic articles as, for
example, disclosed in the following commonly assigned
Patent Applications: IT 22529 A/87, IT 22660 A/89,
IT 19389 A/90, MI 91 A 002038, and in the following
commonly assigned U.S. Patents: 5,055,576, 5,110,922;
and in U.S.-3,567,605; U.S.-5,066,818; and EP 245,020.The photochromic compounds belonging to the three
above cited classes can be suitably mixed, so
as to obtain, after exposure to sun light or U.V.
light, the development of a colour resulting from the
composition of colours of used products. Such a colour
composition results to be particularly useful in the
preparation of organic photochromic glasses for which
neutral colour shades as green, brown and grey, are
required by the market.In general, the photochromic compounds used in
the field of organic glasses in order to obtain
blue or red colour,are those belonging to the class
of spiro-indolino-oxazines, thanks to their good
characteristics of colour development and fatigue
resistance.On the contrary, yellow and orange colours are
obtained by using photochromic compounds belonging to
the class of chromenes or spiro-pyrans such as
disclosed, e.g., in commonly assigned Italian Patent
Applications MI 92 A 002379 and MI 92 A
