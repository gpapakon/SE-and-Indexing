<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for collecting objects (13), packaged to form units, on pallets, the units (13) being supplied in aligned fashion to this apparatus which, according to the invention, has a multiplicity of driven rollers (2) aligned to form a conveying plane. Located at the entrance of the conveying plane (2) is a transverse pusher (4) with pushing arms (4) lying, in the rest position, outside the conveying plane (2). Arranged downstream of the transverse pusher (4) is a vertically movable turnstile (5) with its axis of rotation (15) lying beside the conveying plane and with wings (16) reaching approximately as far as the centre of the conveying plane (2), a gap assigned to said turnstile (5) and intended for raising the latter being formed by shortening a roller (2'). Located at the end of the conveying plane (2) is an end stop (9). Downstream of the turnstile (5) there is optionally arranged a pre-stop (8) which can be lifted and lowered vertically through a roller gap, and in the region of the stops there is provided a pushing beam (24) in order to supply the units in predeterminable patterns (10) to an intermediate floor (6).

Device for the collection on pallets of articles 
packaged into units, whereby the units are supplied 

aligned to this device, with the following features: 

a) the device has a plurality of driven rollers (2) 
aligned to a conveying plane (1), 
b) on the inlet of the conveying plane (1) is present 
a transverse slide with pushing arm (4) lying in 

the stationary position outside of the conveying 
plane, 
c) behind the transverse slide (3) is a vertically 
movable star wheel (5) with rotational axis lying 

next to the conveying plane and wings arranged 
extending approximately to the middle of the 

conveying plane which lie laterally against the 
units to be turned, whereby, associated with these, 

a gap is formed by shortening of a roller (2') for 
the lifting up of the star wheel (5), 
d) on the end of the conveying plane (1) is present 
an end stop (9), behind the star wheel (5) is possibly 

provided a trigger stop (8) which can be raised and 
lowered vertically through a roller gap (7), 
e) in the region of the stops (8,9) is provided an end 
transverse slide (24) in order to guide the units 

(13) in predetermined pattern (10) to an intermediate 
bottom (6). 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in 
that with the transverse slide (3) is also associated 

a lowerable stop (11) passing through a roller gap. 
Device according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that some rollers (12) are rubberised in the region 

of the transverse slide (3) and/or of the star wheel 
(5). 
Device according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the rollers (2,2') have metallic 

surfaces.  
 
Device according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the star wheel (5) has 

periodically impingeable suction openings (14) 
facing the units (13). 
Device according to claim 5, characterised in 
that the suction openings (14) are periodically 

impingeable with compressed air. 
Device according to claim 5 or 6, characterised 
in that the star wheel (5) is arranged on a piston 

(15), whereby with each wing (16) is associated an air 
pipe (17) which stands on a plate (18) and successively 

stands in connection with a suction connection (20) 
with a suction pipe (19) and a pressure pipe (21) with 

compressed air producer (22).
