<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a single-channel radar set having a free-running mixer stage, having a radar antenna, a single-channel radar front end connected thereto, and an evaluation circuit which is connected downstream of the radar front end. In order to be able to form I/Q signal pairs for signal evaluation in the case of such radar sets as well, it is proposed according to the invention to connect a phase shifter between the radar antenna and the radar front end, that the evaluation circuit has two signal channels on the input side, that the radar front end can be connected via a channel changeover switch to in each case one of the two signal channels, that the phase shifter and the channel change-over switch are pulsed synchronously, and the phase shifter switches the phase over between 0 DEG  and (2n-1)x( lambda /8), preferably 45 DEG , with each clock pulse, where n is a natural number and  lambda  is the wavelength at the operating frrequency.
