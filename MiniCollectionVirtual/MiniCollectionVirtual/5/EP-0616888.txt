<ABSTRACT>
A silk screen printing frame 40 having screen tensioning 
rollers 44 which are rotatable to stretch a printing screen 52 

edgewise across the frame and are mounted on the frame by 
improved roller mounting assemblies 48 that secure the rollers 

to roller mounting members 46 at the roller ends. Each roller 
mounting assembly has an end block portion 58 fixed within the 

adjacent roller end, a wrench engaging portion 60 beyond the 
roller end by which the roller may be turned and which may be 

integral with or a separate part from the end block portion, 
a bolt 62 extending axially through the end block 58 and wrench 

engaging portions 60 and the adjacent roller mounting member, 
and a lock nut 64 threaded on the outer end of the bolt for 

releasably securing the roller against turning. A head 66 on the 
inner end of the bolt engages the inner side of the end block 

portion 58 to restrain the bolt against being pulled outwardly 
through the assembly when the lock nut 64 is tightened to secure 

the roller against turning.

<DESCRIPTION>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION: This invention relates generally to 
the silk screen printing art and more particularly to a novel 
printing screen stretch frame. PRIOR ART: Simply stated, a printing screen stretch frame 
comprises a rectangular frame structure having a central 
rectangular opening and screen tensioning means along the 
sides of the frame opening for gripping edges of printing 
screen placed across one side of the frame and stretching the 
screen edgewise. One type of printing screen frame has screen 
tensioning draw bars which are movable laterally in the plane 
of the frame to stretch and release the printing screen. 
Another type of screen frame, referred to herein in places as 
a roller frame, has screen tensioning rollers which are 
rotatable to stretch and release the screen. Two basic types of roller frames are known in the art. 
One type comprises four rigid frame members arranged along 
the four sides of a rectangle and joined end to end at the 
corners of the rectangle to form a rigid rectangular frame 
part and screen rollers rotatably mounted on the frame 
members. The other basic type of roller frame lacks such a 
rigid frame part and includes only corner brackets at the 
four corners of the frame, screen rollers extending along the  
 
four sides of the frame between the adjacent corner brackets, 
and roller mounting means securing the rollers to the corner 
brackets. This latter type of screen frame comprises only the 
corner brackets, rollers, and roller mounting means and is 
rigidized by rigidly securing the rollers to the brackets. 
The present invention is concerned with roller screen frames 
of this latter kind. A number of roller screen frames with and without 
separate rigid frame members have been devised. Among these 
known frames are those illustrated in figures 5-7 of the 
attached drawings and those described in the patents listed 
below. The roller frame illustrated in figures 5-7 of the 
attached drawings includes screen rollers 20 attached to 
corner brackets 22 by bolts 24 having outer heads 26 which 
are accessible for tightening and releasing the bolts and 
threaded shanks 28 which extend inwardly through the corner 
brackets, wrench heads 30 for turning the rollers, and end 
blocks 32 fixed within the roller ends into threaded 
engagement with nuts 34 fixed within the end blocks. Patent 3,601,912 dated Aug. 31, 1978, to Dubbs 
discloses a screen frame having screen rollers 14, 16 joined 
by corner brackets 18. Patent 3,908,293 dated Sept 30, 1975 to Newman
