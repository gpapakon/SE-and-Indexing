<ABSTRACT>
A surveillance and alarm device for room spaces, comprising an infrared radar (8) for controlling the lights as well as a fire and burglar alarm (8, 9, 10, 11). A basic alarm (2) is provided with a light controller (12) to be connected in series with a ceiling light fixture (1) in a room under surveillance, and is further provided with a microprocessor (9) or some other intelligent control circuit, adapted to control the alarm actions of said device either on the basis of a command issued by a lamp light switch (3) or a wireless remote controller (7) or on the basis of a command issued by a key switch (4). The light controller (12) included in the basic alarm (2) switches on said lighting fixture (1) as someone enters a room under surveillance or flashes said lighting fixture (1) in connection with an alarm.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a surveillance and alarm
device for room spaces, comprising an infrared radar for
controlling the lights as well as a fire alarm and a
burglar alarm.The article "Security and Energy Control System" of
February 1985 by Paul S. Sanik of Owens-Corning
Fiberglass Corporation discloses a microprocessor based
control system which provides control of security and
energy management functions. The document GB-A-21 81 285
shows an energy control system for a building comprising
a space detector connected to an energy control system an
to an intruder alarm. The document PCT-WO-85/05753
discloses also an energy control system including
detection means for an intruder, such as an infrared or
microwave sensor whereby lighting is turned on if a
burglar is detected.An object of the invention is to provide a line of simple
safety equipment for homes and offices that can be readily
adopted and connected to existing electric and telephone
equipment.This object is achieved according to the invention on the
basis of the characterizing features set forth in the
appended claim 1.One exemplary embodiment of the invention will now be
described in more detail with reference made to the
accompanying drawing, in which
fig. 1is a schematic view showing the wiring of a device
of the invention to electric and telephone
equipment andfig. 2shows a block diagram for the components included
in a (basic) alarm unit 2.The device comprises a (basic) alarm unit 2 to be connected in
series with a ceiling light fixture 1 in the room to be
placed under surveillance, said basic alarm unit including a
fire detector 11 and an infrared burglar-alarm-type movement detector 8 and
also a light controller 12 integrated in a single unit.
The basic alarm unit 2 is provided with a microprocessor 9,
which is adapted to control the actions of said device
either on the basis of a command issued by a light switch  
3 for lamp 1 or on the basis of a
command issued by a key switch 4. In its basic embodiment,
the actions of alarm 2 are controlled by means of light
switch 3. The control is effected by means of successive
shorter or longer switch-on periods, issued by light
switch 3 and set by a user.One or a plurality of basic alarms 2 can also be
controlled by means of a basic shunt switch, which is a
key switch 4. The key switch 4 is connected either to
light switch 3 or to a supply line for an array of lights.
The key switch 4 is used for cutting away one half-wave
whenever the alarm is active.Thus, the basic alarm 2 produces
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A surveillance and alarm device for room spaces, comprising
a fire detector (11) and an infrared movement detector

(8) for controlling the lights, said device further including
a microprocessor (9) connected to said fire

detector and said movement detector and being adapted to
control the alarm actions of said device, and a light

controller (12) for switching on a lamp of a ceiling light
fixture (1) as someone enters a room under surveillance,

said light controller (12) being connected in series with
said lamp (1) and with a light switch (3) of said lamp or a key switch (4) and

being controlled by said microprocessor, 
characterized
 in that said light switch (3) or the key
switch (4) is connected via lamp current supply line to

said microprocessor (9), which is switchable between an
alarm enabling and an alarm non-enabling conditions with

said light switch (3) or said key switch (4), said light controller
(12) being controlled such that it gives an alarm

by flashing said lamp (1) in said alarm enabling condition
if the room under surveillance is entered, but in said

alarm non-enabling condition it only switches the lamp on
if the room under surveillance is entered, said alarm unit

(2) also having a sound siren (10) giving sound alarms
with different sound sequences for fire alarm and for

burglar alarm.
A surveillance and alarm device as set forth in claim
1, 
characterized
 in that said key switch (4)
is connected either to a light switch (3) or to a supply

line for a series of lighting fixtures.
A surveillance and alarm device as set forth in claim 1
or 2, 
characterized
 in that said device
is coupled by sound to a robot alarm (5) 

connected with a telephone line and not including any keyboard, which
robot alarm (5) is able to identify the alarms as pertaining to fire or burglary on the basis of the sequences

of the siren sound of the alarm unit (2), said robot alarm (5)
being provided with a microprocessor for analyzing an

alarm signal and for calling the relevant emergency number.
