<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a prestressed ground anchor. The longitudinal reinforcement (6) in the anchor is sealed into the ground by a hardened sealing slurry in which there is, around the armature, a tube (2) designed to resist the prestressing tension but which is broken by a tension exerted on the reinforcement which is greater than the prestressing tension but insufficient to break the reinforcement.

Method for facilitating, after service, the
extraction of the reinforcement of an anchoring tension

rod comprising a longitudinal reinforcement (6), one end
of which is pushed into the ground and bedded in the

ground by a hardened mass of a bedding grout and the
opposite end of which is stressed by tensioning mea
ns in
order to prestress the tension rod, the tension rod

including a tube (2) around the reinforcement,
characterized in that the tube is incorporated into the

bedding grout, before it sets, so that the tube ensures
continuity of the seal between the reinforcement and the

ground, the said tube being chosen to withstand the
prestressing tension and able to be broken by a tension

greater than the prestressing tension but insufficient to
break the reinforcement (6).
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the said tube (2) is installed in a hole (1) in the

ground before inserting the reinforcement (6) into the
tube.
Method according to Claim 2, characterized in
that the tube (2) is bedded in a hole (1) by a bedding

grout injected from the inside of the tube.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the tube (2) is fixed to the reinforcement (6) by

means of a hardened bedding grout before inserting the
tube and the reinforcement into a hole (1) in the ground.
Method according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that a glass-fibre tube (2) is used.
Anchoring tension rod comprising a longitudinal 
reinforcement (6) to be pushed into a hole (1) in the

ground and to be bedded in the ground by a bedding grout,
the opposite end (6b) of the reinforcement being able to

be stressed by tensioning means (7, 8) in order to
prestress the tension rod, and a tube (2) to be arranged

around the reinforcement in the bedding grout, the said
tube (2) being able to withstand the prestressing

tension, characterized in that the tube (2) is
constructed in such a way that its wall is put in tension

without it breaking due to the effect of prestressing the
reinforcement (6), ensuring the transition of the tensile

load from the tension rod to the ground during the
service phase, and is able to be broken by a tension

exerted on the reinforcement which is greater than the
prestressing tension but insufficient to break the

reinforcement.
Tension rod according to Claim 6, in which the
said tube (2) is made of glass fibres.
Tension rod according to Claim 6 or 7 in service
in the ground, the lower end (6a) of the reinforcement

being bedded in the ground by the hardened grout
containing the said tube (2) around the reinforcement and

the upper end (6b) of the reinforcement being stressed by
a prestressing tension.
