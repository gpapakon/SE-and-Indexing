<ABSTRACT>
Provided is a polypeptide which specifically binds to 
the γ-chain of human interleukin-2 receptor to selectively 

inhibit the binding of the γ-chain of human interleukin-2 
receptor to the β-chain of the same, therefore having an 

activity of blocking the human interleukin-2 response. Also 
provided are an immunosuppressant containing the polypeptide, 

a DNA gene coding for the polypeptide, a recombinant DNA 
having the gene, a transformant having the recombinant DNA, 

and a method for producing the objective polypeptide by 
incubating the transformant. The novel polypeptide is 

usable, independently or along with substances capable of 
inhibiting the binding of interleukin-2 to interleukin-2 

receptor, as a medicine effective in preventing the rejection 
of grafts after transplantation and also in curing 

inflammatory diseases such as allergic diseases and 
autoimmune diseases, the possibility that interleukin-2 will 

actively participate in the rejection and also in such 
inflammatory diseases having been suggested.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polypeptide which 
specifically binds to the γ-chain of the interleukin-2 receptor 
to selectively inhibit the binding of the γ-chain of the 
interleukin-2 receptor to the β-chain of the same, therefore 
being able to block the interleukin-2 response, and also to a 
pharmaceutical composition containing the polypeptide, a DNA 
coding for the polypeptide, a recombinant DNA containing the 
gene, a transformant bearing the recombinant DNA, and a method 
for producing the polypeptide by cultivating the transformant. The polypeptide of the present invention is a valuable 
substance which is usable, independently or along with 
substances capable of inhibiting the binding of interleukin-2 
to interleukin-2 receptor, as a medicine effective in 
preventing the rejection after transplantation and also in 
curing inflammatory diseases such as allergic diseases and 
autoimmune diseases, the possibility that interleukin-2 will 
participate in the rejection and also in such inflammatory 
diseases having been suggested. "Interleukin-2" may be hereinafter referred to as "IL-2". In these days when the surgical technique for 
transplantation has been improved noticeably, the success in 
transplantation essentially depends upon how to inhibit the 
rejection of the grafts after the operation. The rejection 
results from a series of immunoreactions occurring through the 
interaction of the grafts with organs of recipients which have 
recognized the grafts as foreign matter to reject them. 
Therefore, so-called immunosuppressants such as various 
steroids, azathiopurine, methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine have 
heretofore been used as rejection-inhibiting medicines. 
However, since the safety range of such medicines was narrow 
and their effects were weak, extreme improvement in the take of  
 
grafts in recipients could not be attained even though such 
medicines were applied to them. Using cyclosporin A that has been developed recently, the 
take of grafts in recipients has become improved surprisingly. 
However, it has been clarified that cyclosporin A has serious 
nephrotoxicity, which has obliged us to limit its use. Given the situations, it is desired to develop more safe, 
more specific and more effective immunosuppressants. IL-2 is a protein that is produced by helper T-cells, and 
it is an extremely important factor for host defence machinery, 
as having various functions of a broad range, for example, for 
induction of proliferation and differentiation of killer T-cells 
and
