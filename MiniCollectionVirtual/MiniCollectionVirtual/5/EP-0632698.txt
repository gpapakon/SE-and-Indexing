<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is an inflation and fluid release mechanism for an inflatable article of manufacture. The inflation mechanism generally comprises a pump (40) and a resilient fluid intake valve (42). The fluid release mechanism (16) includes a housing (100), a fluid release means (102) and a protective cover (120) which is received about the exterior of the housing. The protective cover of the fluid release mechanism may also function as a connector for an "off board" inflation mechanism.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Inflation Mechanism for an Inflatable Article of ManufactureField of the InventionThe present invention relates generally to an inflation and fluid release mechanism for an inflatable article of manufacture. More particularly the invention relates to a pump and fluid intake valve and to a cover for a fluid release mechanism.Background of the InventionRecently, the use of inflatable devices within articles of manufacture has become widespread. For example, inflatable devices are now incorporated into a variety of athletic shoes, as well as various other types of athletic equipment such as protective helmets, apparel and baseball gloves. The inflatable devices used in conjunction with these articles of manufacture increasingly include an air-impervious bladder which is manually inflated by an inflation mechanism disposed on the article (i.e., the inflation mechanism is located "on board" the inflatable article of manufacture). When an on board inflation mechanism is employed, it is imperative that the mechanism be as small as possible to minimize interference with the intended use of the article. However, as the size of the inflation mechanism is decreased, so is its ability to displace fluid and pump the same into the inflatable bladder. Thus, a highly efficient inflation mechanism (that is, one which completely displaces its maximum fluid volume to an inflatable bladder) is desired.One inflation mechanism which has been successful in footwear is formed of a latex rubber bulb which includes an integral one-way inlet valve.SUBSTITUTE SHEET 

The inlet valve typically extends outwardly from one side of the bulb. Disposed on the opposite side of the bulb is an outlet mechanism which transfers fluid (air) from the latex bulb to the inflatable bladder.U.S. Patent No. 5,074,765 to Pekar discloses a dome-like air pump which is formed from a resilient, elastomeric material capable of being bonded to an opening in an inflatable bladder. The pump is provided with an inlet flapper type valve which is integrally formed in a wall of the pump. An outlet check valve of the "duck-bill" type extends through an opening located in the base of the pump to transfer air from the pump to the inflatable bladder. It is a principal object of the present invention to provide an inflation mechanism for an inflatable article of manufacture which is of simple, compact construction and operationally reliable. â€¢Another object of the invention is to provide an inflation mechanism for an inflatable article of manufacture which is
