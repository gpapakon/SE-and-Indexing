<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a plastic hollow body (2) which is designed, at least on an openable bottom region (3) or a closed outlet opening, as a hollow, bead-like and/or hollow-cylindrical section with a peripheral separation zone (5), it being possible to mount a rotatably guided cutting closure on said section for opening, which closure has a cutting device (9) in a cap-shaped receiving opening (8) on the upper or lower side. In this case, the cutting closure is designed as a cutting cap (7), a clamping lip (13) being placed in the receiving opening (8) containing the cutting device (9) and/or in a cap-shaped receiving opening (37) located on the opposite side, which clamping lip passes around the periphery coaxially to the cap axis (11) at the receiving opening, is spaced away from a cylindrical outer wall (12) of the receiving opening (8), and forms a peripheral receiving groove (14) which is bounded radially by said outer wall (12) and in which there can be introduced a cylindrically projecting, peripheral opening edge (15) of the outlet opening to be opened, which is initially closed by a bottom (3) or a moulded-on closure, or of an opening (24) in the hollow body which is to be closed by the cutting cap (7), thus providing a closure device (1). In this case, the cutting device (9) consists of at least one cutting plate (19) which is aligned laterally to the peripheral wall of the separation zone (5) and axially, radially or obliquely relative to the cap axis (11) in the cap-shaped receiving opening (8) and is placed on or laterally on the inside next to a circular guide projection, running coaxially to the cap axis (11), or is placed projecting inwards or outwards relative to such an arrangement of axially protruding guide cams (16) with spacing from the cap bottom (31). Using the cutting cap (7), the bead-like section can be cut off at the separation zone easily and precisely in the case of rotationally symmetrical hollow bodies.
