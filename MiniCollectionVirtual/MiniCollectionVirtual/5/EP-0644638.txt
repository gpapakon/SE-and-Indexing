<ABSTRACT>
A transportable, remotely actuated racking device is 
provided for use in connection the insertion and removal of very 

high voltage industrial circuit breakers. The device includes a 
motor activated rod assembly which is moved between first and 

second positions for grasping of the circuit breaker during 
insertion and removal from the circuit breaker housing. The 

racking device is remotely operated from a point of safety relative 
to the circuit breaker whereby direct exposure to possible fire and 

explosions which might occur during racking is greatly reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
In many industrial applications, such as generator or 
transmission stations and points for the generation and 
transmission of electrical energy, very high amperes, high voltage 
circuit breakers are used in establishing and breaking high voltage 
circuits. Such circuit breakers also are utilized in electronic  
 
components within and to large electric motors for aircraft carrier 
components, large field operation stations, and the like wherein 
the electric power is in a range of approximately two thousand to 
twelve thousand amperes at six hundred to six thousand volts. Such 
circuit breakers often are provided within housings in rows or 
banks, or stocks, as shown in Fig. 1. Often times, it is necessary to insert or remove a circuit 
breaker within one or more of the housings forming the bank of 
circuit breaker housings. Such requirement is necessitated by, for 
example, an increase or decrease of load requirement in the 
particular facility, or for repair or replacement of a particular 
circuit breaker, or line component or the power line extending to 
the circuit breaker, so that the circuit breaker components will 
accept a lower or higher voltage and amperes conducting circuit 
breaker, or for various other reasons known to those skilled in the 
art. In the past, the prior art sometimes has provided circuit 
breaker assemblies that are affixed within the circuit breaker 
housing, but are not designed to be transportable from one housing 
to another housing in the bank of circuit breakers. Some of these 
devices require opening of the circuit breaker housing door for 
activation, while others may be operated either manually, 
mechanically or electrically with the door remaining shut. The procedure for inserting and removing a circuit breaker 
from such housing is referred to as "racking-in and/or racking-out". 
When the circuit breaker is "racked-in", it is in the "on" 
position relative to the circuit therefor, and when it is in the  
 
"racked-out", it is in the "off" or "closed" position relative to 
said circuit. Thus, the device utilized in such a procedure is 
commonly referred to by those skilled in the art of inserting and 
removing such circuit breakers as a "racking device". In the past, many such circuit breakers have been "racked" by 
insertion within the housing, as the occasion requires, into a cog 
system along the floor of the circuit breaker housing which is 
manually affixed to one end of a circuit breaker, and thereafter, 
operable to engage or disengage the circuit breaker
