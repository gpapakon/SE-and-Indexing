<ABSTRACT>
A personal care composition in the form of an aqueous liquid comprises: i) a lipid composition comprising three components A, B and C, where A is a molecule having at least two hydrocarbon chains and a polar head group for which: (a); B is molecule having one long chain and a polar head group; and C comprises a compound capable of assisting the formation of lipid bilayers and stabilising any lipid bilayers formed in the lipid composition; and the molar ratio of A:B:C is 1.0:1.5 to 6.0:1.1 to 8.0; ii) a surface active agent selected from anionic, nonionic, cationic, zwitterionic, amphoteric surface active agents, soap and mixtures thereof; and iii) a deposition aid. The composition may be in the form of for example a shower gel or facial cleanser which is temporarily applied to the skin before being removed such as wiping or rinsing it from the skin.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PERSONAL CARE COMPOSITIONThe invention relates to a personal care composition in liquid or gel form suitable for personal washing. In particular, it is concerned with compositions, intended for washing and/or cleansing of the human skin, which prevent or ameliorate skin dryness, skin wrinkling, chapping and ageing.It is generally understood that ceramides present within the intercellular lipid lamellae of the stratum corneum play an important role in the production and maintenance of the water permeability barrier of the skin. Ceramides, or substances closely related to them, have been disclosed as components of skin care compositions. In particular, Kao Corporation in GB 2178312 and GB 2213723 discloses the use of natural ceramides extracted from skin in products for topical application. Also, Kao Corporation in EP 227994 and EP 282816 discloses the use of synthetic ceramides, which are similar to their natural counterparts found in skin.It is also known that, in addition to ceramides, the lipid lamellae comprises sterol and fatty acids (N Y Schurer, P M Elias (1991) Adv Lip Res _A 27-56 Acad Press) .It is believed that one of the causes of skin drying and ageing is a reduction in the amount of lipid contained within intercellular lipid lamella of the stratum corneum. It has been shown in Intermolecular and Surface Forces, (1985) Jacob N Isrealachvili, ed Acad Press, Chapter 16 entitled "Aggregation of Amphiphilic Molecules into Micelles, Bilayers, Vesicles and Biological Membranes" that suitable lipids for forming a bilayer are those having a polar head group and at least two hydrocarbon chains, such that there exists a clearly defined relationship 

between the volume occupied by the hydrocarbon chains and optimum area occupied by the polar head group. This relationship is that:aoxc should be greater than 0.5 but less than or equal to 1.0 whereV is the volume of the hydrocarbon chainsIc is the critical length of the hydrocarbon chains a0 is the optimum area of the polar head group.EP-A-556 957 discloses compositions which satisfy the aforementioned relationship comprising (a) ceramides, (b) long chain fatty acids and a third component (c) , for exam squalene, which is capable of assisting and stabilising li bilayers formed m the composition and where the ratio of a:b:c is from 1:1.5 to 6.0:1.1 to 8.0 respectively. The disclosed compositions are intended for topical applicatio to the human, hair, skin or nails. In particular they are "leave-on" products which are intended to be permanently applied to
