<ABSTRACT>
A machine magazine (11) for accommodating several tools (12) movable in a first transport direction (13) is allocated to a machine tool (10). Furthermore, a change magazine (17) for accommodating several tools (18) movable in a second transport direction (19) is provided. The tools (18) are to be put into or removed from the machine magazine (11). Furthermore, a transfer device (21) is provided for the tool change between the machine magazine (11) and the change magazine (17). At the machine tool (10), the first and second transport directions (13, 19) are opposed to one another (Fig. 1). Furthermore, a tool-changing method is described which is carried out on the machine tool (10).

<CLAIMS>
A machine tool comprising an associated machine magazine
(11) for receiving a plurality of tools (12) that can be

moved in a first transport direction (13), a changing
magazine (17) for receiving a plurality of tools (18) that

can be moved in a second transport direction (19) and are
to be inserted into or removed from said machine magazine

(11), as well as at least one transfer apparatus (21) for
changing tools between the machine magazine (11) and the

changing magazine (17), wherein the transfer apparatus
(21) comprises magazine switches (28), by means of which

the machine magazine (11) and the changing magazine (17)
can be connected in series for the tool exchange, characterized

in that the machine magazine (11) and the changing
magazine (17) can be connected by means of the magazine

switches (28) in series such that at the same time a tool
exchange from the machine magazine (11) into said changing

magazine (17) on the one hand as well as from the changing
magazine (17) into the machine magazine (11) on the other

hand is possible, wherein the first and second transport
direction (13, 19) are opposite to each other in a transfer

region.
A machine tool as in claim 1, characterized in that the
tools (12, 18) are moved in the machine magazine (11) and

the changing magazine (17) simultanously. 
A method for changing tools between a machine magazine
(11) associated with a machine tool (10) and a changing

magazine (17), wherein the machine magazine (11) receives
a plurality of tools (12) that can be moved in a first

transport direction (13), the changing magazine (17) receives
a plurality of tools (18) that can be moved in a

second transport direction (19) and are to be inserted
into or removed from the machine magazine (11), and

wherein a transfer apparatus (21) changes the tools (12,
18) between the machine magazine (11) and the changing

magazine (17), wherein the transfer apparatus (21) connects
the machine magazine (11) and the changing magazine

(17) by means of magazine switches in series temporarily,
characterized in that the magazine switches (28) connect

the machine magazine (11) and the changing magazine (17)
in series such that at the same time a tool exchange from

the machine magazine (11) into the changing magazine (17)
on the one hand as well as from the changing magazine (17)

into the machine magazine (11) on the other hand is possible,
whereby the tools (12, 18) in the machine magazine

(11) and the changing magazine (17) are moved simultaneously
but in opposite direction.
