<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to rubber-modified
polystyrene resin compositions and injection
molded articles formed therefrom. More particularly, the
present invention relates to a rubber-modified
polystyrene resin composition which contains a rubber
elastomer to improve the impact strength of polystyrene
and which has a high heat resistance and flowability.
The invention also concerns rubber-modified
polystyrene resin compositions suitable for producing
molded articles such as household electric appliances,
household articles, miscellaneous goods, etc., and
injection-molded articles having a highly glossy
appearance.Rubber-modified polystyrene resin compositions
prepared from a polystyrene resin and a rubber-like
polymer are known as high impact polystyrenes (HIPS).
Such high impact polystyrene is useful as a resin having
an improved impact strength without marked decrease in
the level of rigidity as observed in conventional
polystyrenes. Thus, rubber-modified polystyrene resin 
compositions are preferably used in producing molded
articles such as household electric appliances, household
articles, miscellaneous goods, etc.Processes for preparing high impact
polystyrenes are known which comprise adding to a styrene
monomer a diene type rubber elastomer such as
polybutadiene, styrene-butadiene copolymers, etc., and
polymerizing the mixture with stirring, whereby a rubber-modified
polystyrene resin composition is produced. The
obtained composition has a structure in which particles
of a soft component, composed of the rubber elastomer and a
polystyrene resin, exist dispersed in a polystyrene
matrix. However, the rubber-modified polystyrene resin
compositions obtained by such conventional processes have
problems. That is to say, these polystyrene resin
compositions show a lower flowability during molding such
as injection molding than non-modified polystyrene resin
compositions, and the highly glossy articles prepared by
injection-molding the conventional rubber-modified
polystyrene resin composition have the problem that a
portion thereof corresponding to a cavity part which is
away from a gate is less glossy.In order to cope with these problems, it is
known to improve the flowability of the resin (1) by
reducing the molecular weight of the matrix polystyrene, 
or (2) by adding a plasticizer predominantly comprising a
liquid paraffin such as mineral oils, etc. However,
method (1) has a drawback that the strength of the molded
articles is reduced, and method (2) has the problem that
the heat resistance of
