<ABSTRACT>
An instrument for generating tone signals, 
by which is meant signals intended for generating 

sounds or musical notes, or alternatively signals for 
generating optical images and the like, has a 

radiation emitter arranged to emit radiation into an 
elongate emission space. A sensor is sensitive to 

radiation received from an elongate sensing space, 
which is non-coincident with the emission space. The 

current signals are generated in response to the 
sensor. Preferably, the emission sensing spaces 

partially overlap as a result of a different 
orientation of the spaces.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to radiation actuated devices, and 
especially to musical instruments based on other kind of 
waves, such as ultrasonic or microwaves, viz. apparatus 
whereby musical tones are selectively produced by 
selectively acting on visible or non-visible radiation. 
While the invention will be described with particular 
reference to musical instruments, it can be applied to other 
devices, in particular to game playing devices, e.g. 
computer controlled. Apparatus for producing sounds by radiation have been known in the 
art for a long time. They are based on the principle of producing 
radiation, modifying it, sensing the modifications and translating 
the same to signals, e.g. electric or electronic signals, which in turn 
produce musical tones. The modifications of the radiation may be 
produced by the motion of the operator's body in a space that is 
traversed by the radiation. The operator will be referred to 
hereinafter as "the player". French patent 72.39367 utilizes radar radiation. The player's body 
reflects the radiation towards a sensor and the Doppler effect is 
produced, which generates signals that are translated into acoustic 
frequencies. The music may be generated as a function of the speed of 
the player's motion or of his distance from the radiation source.  French patent 81.06219 uses laser radiation, which surrounds a 
space in which the player moves and the tones are produced by the 
interception of a ray by the player's body. U.S.P. 4,429,607 describes an apparatus comprising a number of 
light emitters and sensors adjacent thereto, tones being produced by 
reflecting back, e.g. by means of a finger, an emitted ray to the 
corresponding sensor. WO 87/02168 describes, among other things, an apparatus applying 
the same tone-producing means as the aforesaid U.S. patent, but 
using retroflective elements applied to the human body to produce 
reflection that is stronger than random reflections, due e.g., to the 
ceiling. Alternatively, random reflections are neutralized by 
confining both the emitted and the reflected beams within a narrow 
tube. The application also describes a way of producing different 
octaves by sensing the order in which a plurality of laser rays are 
intercepted by the player's body. All the prior art apparatus are somewhat primitive if considered as 
musical instruments. They can produce disjointed tones and a 
succession thereof, much as what would be produced by a beginner 
slowly and arhythmically depressing the keys of a keyboard actuated
