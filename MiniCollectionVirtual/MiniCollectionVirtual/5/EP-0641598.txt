<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
producing a chromium-based fluorination catalyst, the
obtained fluorination catalyst or catalyst precursor and
a fluorination process and more particularly to a process
for producing a chromium-based fluorination catalyst
which can be used in the production of a halogenated
hydrocarbon by a fluorination reaction of a halogenated
hydrocarbon having 1 to 4 carbon atoms in a gaseous
phase, the obtained fluorination catalyst and a process
for fluorinating a halogenated hydrocarbon using said
catalyst. Especially, the present invention aims to
provide a process for producing a catalyst which can
exhibit high activity and selectivity and is useful for
the production of hydrofluorocarbons (abbreviated to
"HFC") and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (abbreviated to
"HCFC") which, in recent years, have been mass-produced
as alternative flons.The process for producing a halogenated
hydrocarbon containing fluorine from a halogenated
hydrocarbon having 1 to 4 carbon atoms and hydrogen
fluoride is roughly classified into a gaseous phase
process and a liquid phase process. In recent years, a
problem of the degradation of ozonosphere by
chlorofluorocarbons (abbreviated to "CFC") having in
their molecules a chlorine atom(s) has become brought to
the fore, and HCFC having hydrogen in its molecule and
HFC not having chlorine in its molecule have been
proposed as alternatives for CFC (hereinafter referred to
as "alternative flons"), and some of them have been 
already mass-produced. A gaseous phase process is a
particularly promising process for the production of
these alternative flons. In the gaseous phase process,
the selection of the catalyst is important, and various
catalysts have been proposed for this purpose up to now.In patents, various metals such as Cu, Ag, Na,
Cd, Ca, Zn, Hg, V, Sb, Mn, Fe, Ni, Co and Pt, for
example, in the form of halides supported on activated
carbon, are described to be useful as the catalyst (see
U.S. Patent No. 2005707). In many cases, however, a
catalyst composed mainly of an oxide, fluoride or
oxyfluoride of chromium or a halide of aluminum, iron or
other metals is generally used. Especially, it is most
common to use a catalyst comprising a chromium oxide, and
many production methods and compositions have hitherto
been proposed for the chromium oxide catalyst.Japanese Examined Patent Publication (Kokoku)
No. 39-10310 proposes a Cr2O3 catalyst produced by
imprenating alumina with chromic(VI) acid, drying the
impregnated alumina and subjecting the
