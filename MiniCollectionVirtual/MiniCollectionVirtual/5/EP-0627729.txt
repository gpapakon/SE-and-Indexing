<ABSTRACT>
In a method for magnetically recording and reproducing 
signals in and from a magnetic recording medium via a thin film 

magnetic head, the recording medium has a magnetic layer of up 
to 0.5 µm thick containing hexagonal ferromagnetic particles on 

a non-magnetic substrate, and the magnetic head (1-12) 
includes a 

recording head (8-11) 
whose gap adjacent portion is formed of a soft 

magnetic material having a saturation magnetic flux density of 
at least 0.7 T and a reproducing MR head (3-6). 

In one form, the 
magnetic layer has a surface roughness (Ra) of up to 5 nm, and 

a coercivity (Hc) of at least 1,100 Oe and a squareness ratio 
(S) of at least 0.70. In another form, the magnetic layer 

contains hexagonal ferrite and has a squareness ratio (S⊥) of 
at least 0.70, and the magnetic head produces a reproduction 

output which is subject to zero-crossing detection without 
passing through a differential circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for magnetically 
recording and reproducing signals in and from a magnetic 
recording medium via a magnetic head and more particularly, to 
such a method for magnetically recording and reproducing 
digital signals in a high density. Most magnetic recording devices used in computers and 
video machines rely on the mode of recording and reproducing 
information signals in and from magnetic recording media by 
moving electromagnetic induction-type transducer elements as 
typified by magnetic heads relative to the magnetic recording 
media in close proximity or contact relationship to the surface 
thereof. To meet the demands for greater capacity, higher 
transfer speed and smaller size, the development efforts now 
made on these magnetic recording devices aim at high density 
recording. To accommodate such high density recording, 
magnetic recording media should have magnetic layers which have 
higher coercivity, reduced thickness and smoothness. On the 
side of magnetic heads, it is desired to have a narrower gap 
and higher saturation magnetic flux density.  Magnetic recording media used in the prior art are 
generally coated magnetic recording media having a magnetic 
coating layer which is formed by coating a magnetic composition 
containing magnetic powder and a binder. Such coated magnetic 
recording media are widely used in the form of magnetic tape 
and magnetic disks due to their advantage that the magnetic 
coating has low surface energy and can have a substantial 
amount of lubricant impregnated in its interior so that it may 
provide low friction to the head and be well durable against 
sliding contact with the head. However, the coated media have 
the drawback that they are low in residual magnetization 
because the magnetic recording layer contains more amounts of 
non-magnetic components such as the binder and abrasive and 
therefore, they cannot be increased in reproduction output. 
The magnetic recording media of this type use gamma-Fe₂O₃ and 
cobalt-adsorbed gamma-Fe₂O₃ as magnetic powder. These magnetic 
powders, however, have low coercivity of about 1,000 Oe at 
maximum and are not sufficient for high-density recording. Under the circumstances, a switch is partially made to the 
use of metal thin film type magnetic recording media having a 
continuous thin film type magnetic layer because they have 
excellent electromagnetic properties and allow for high-density 
recording. For the preparation of metal thin film type 
magnetic recording media, there
