<ABSTRACT>
A pick correlation method, comprises the steps of 
displaying a pick marker on a display screen; directing the 

pick marker at an image on the display screen, the image 
comprising at least one line primitive, and the pick marker 

having a pick window corresponding thereto; subjecting the at 
least one line primitive to a trivial test, whereby the at 

least one line primitive can be trivially tested by the 
trivial test if the at least one line primitive has both of 

its end-points outside of the same extended edge of the 
rectangular shaped pick window and, if successfully tested by 

the trivial test, accepting or rejecting the at least one 
line primitive in accordance with the results of the trivial 

test; and if the at least one line primitive cannot be 
trivially tested, subjecting the at least one line primitive 

to a non-trivial test which does not require performing 
floating point operations, and accepting or rejecting the at 

least one line primitive in accordance with the results of 
the non-trivial 

test.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to graphic 
display systems and, more specifically, to a graphic display 
system which allows for picking an object from a display 
screen. Computer graphic images are often made up of line 
primitives. Line primitives can represent many types of 
objects in computer graphic systems. Such objects can be, 
for example, electrical, mechanical, chemical, architectural, 
or artistic in nature. Most graphic systems represent the 
object on the display screen by a set of data which 
represents the coordinates of the line primitives. For 
example, in a two-dimensional display, these coordinate data 
sets are sets of values, such as x₁,y₁; x₂,y₂; etc., which 
represent each end-point x-y coordinate location of each line 
primitive contained in the display; more specifically, the 
coordinate data x₁,y₁ corresponds to one end-point of a line 
primitive, and the companion coordinate data x₂,y₂ corresponds 
to the other end-point of the same line primitive. The 
quantity of line primitives representing the images on a 
display screen can be extraordinarily large depending on the 
number and complexity of objects being displayed. Typically, 
in design systems, the quantity of line primitives 
corresponding to the objects shown on a display screen can at 
any given time range from thousands to hundreds of thousands. Selecting an object on a screen is commonly referred to 
as "picking". The picking of an object is generally enabled 
using a pick marker to select the object on the displayed 
image. The pick marker used in display systems can take the  
 
form of any symbol, such as an arrow, star, polygon, 
rectangle, line etc.; and a user can move the pick marker 
about a display screen by various means, such as using a 
"mouse", light pen, keypad, etc. "Pick correlation" refers 
to the task of determining if the pick marker has a "hit" on, 
or has picked, a line primitive (and thus the object to which 
the line primitive corresponds) in the displayed image. Currently, two methods are used for pick correlation, 
the so-called analytical method and the so-called clipping 
method. An example of an analytical method is disclosed in 
U.S. Patent No. 4,698,625, to McCaskill et al. which relates 
to a technique for facilitating the selection of a graphic 
object on a display screen by a user. When a pointing cursor 
is brought to within a predetermined distance of a graphic 
object, the point on the graphic object closest to the 
pointing cursor is highlighted to show that the graphic
