<ABSTRACT>
A hyperacuity printing system for rendering image data on a recording medium, the 
image data being rendered as an array of pixels across the recording medium in a fastscan 

direction, and an orthogonal slowscan direction. The system includes a data source (51) for 
supplying grayscale input image data and a scanning device (15-26) for rendering grayscale 

output image data, the scanning device (15-26) having a writing device (15) for writing scan 
spots on the recording medium at a writing pitch in the slowscan direction and a writing pitch 

in the fastscan direction. The system also includes transformation circuitry (50) for 
transforming the grayscale input image data into grayscale output image data, the 

transformation circuitry including a halftoner (70), a thresholder (68), and a selection device 
(62,300), where the selection device selects either the thresholder (68) or the halftoner (70) to 

provide the grayscale output image data. The selection device includes a macro selection 

function (62) and a micro selection function (300), the micro selection (62) function being able 
to select the thresholder (68) or the halftoner (70) with a precision finer than the writing pitch 

in either the slowscan or the fastscan direction. Finally, provided is a modulating device (28; 
Fig.2) coupled between the transformation circuitry (50) and the scanning device (15-26) for 

intensity modulating each of the scan spots in accordance with the grayscale output image 
data.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a hyperacuity printer according to the preamble of claim 1,
including an image processing function, and more particularly, an image processing function for
performing micro segmentation in.An original document may contain image data having a mixture of pictorial images and
lineart. Photographs and paintings are examples of pictorial images and are generally halftoned
before being printed. The term "lineart" refers to any information on the original document having
a solid tone of color, for example, an alphanumeric text or a solid color line and is generally
thresholded before printing. This image data can be electronically scanned in using a raster input
scanner or may be generated by a computer.A printer can use a halftoning method to achieve many density levels at the expense of
resolution to print pictorials and images or a thresholding method to achieve two density levels at
high resolution to print alphanumeric text and lineart. In order to print using the halftoning method
and/or thresholding method, the printer has a halftoning circuitry and/or a thresholding circuitry
(hereinafter, respectively, "halftoner" and "thresholder"). General purpose halftoners and
thresholders are known in the art and thus, need not be discussed in detail.Although text and lineart can be halftoned to produce a tint of the desired color, such
information is usually printed non-halftoned. A problem known as aliasing occurs in the printed
document when the halftoning method is used to print the lineart information. The printed
document exhibits jagged edges which degrade the quality of the printed document. Therefore, if
an original document contains pictorial images and lineart, there is a need for the printer to switch
between a halftoning method for printing the pictorial images and a thresholding method for
printing the lineart. This switching is referred to in the art as segmentation.For one example, US-A-4,903,143 to Sakamoto discloses an image processing apparatus
having a discriminating circuit for detection an amount of change in density level of the input pixel
data for every pixel and for discriminating the content of the image of the objective pixel data and a
selector for selecting the processing mode of the projective pixel data in accordance with the result
of the discrimination. Either halftone processing mode or the non-halftone processing mode is
selected by the selector on the basis of the result of the discrimination. The non-halftone
processing mode is continuously selected
