<ABSTRACT>
An antenna element (33) for anti-theft devices (10, 
11) of the type affecting a magnetic, acoustic or 

electromagnetic field, has two antennas (35) projecting 
from opposite sides of said element and forms together with 

said antennas a configuration similar to the letter S.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an antenna element for anti-theft
devices of the type affecting a magnetic, acoustic or
electromagnetic field, which is maintained between bow-shaped
antennas at the exit of a shop, to disturb the field
and cause signal generation.The antenna element of the invention is defined by the
characteristics of claim 1.An antenna device according to the preamble of Claim 1 is
known from EP-A-0 002 595.In order to explain the invention in more detail an
embodiment thereof will be described below reference being
made to the accompanying drawing in which
FIG. 1 is a fragmentary perspective view of a
spectacle frame provided with an anti-theft device,
andFIG. 2 is view of a cover from the back side thereof
which is attached to the anti-theft device and is
provided with the antenna element of the invention.The anti-theft device in FIG. 1 comprises a sleeve 10
open at one end thereof, which has rectangular cross-sectional
shape and preferably is made of plastics, for
example polycarbonate. On one broad side thereof the sleeve
is provided with a cover 11 of the same material as the
sleeve, said cover being attached to the sleeve by
ultrasound welding. The sleeve 10 has opposing longitudinal
slots 12 in the two narrow sides thereof, which are big
enough to allow the bow 14 of a spectacle frame 13 to be
passed through the slots. Clamping means is provided in the
sleeve 10, and the body formed by sleeve 10 and cover 11 is
mounted to the bow, and is demounted from the bow by using
a special tool, which can be engaged with said clamping
means.Inside the body there is located an element 33 (a so-called
"diode") of the type affecting a magnetic, acoustic
or electromagnetic field maintained between bow-shaped 
antennas at the exit of a shop, to disturb the field and
cause signal generation. Said element is mounted inside the
cover 11, and for this purpose the cover has on the
backside thereof four small pins 34 between which the
element 33 is located while antenneas 35 of flexible wire
provided on the element are passed around other, large pins
36 on the backside of the cover. When the cover 11 is
attached to the sleeve 10 the pins are positioned adjacent
the outside surface of the sleeve such that the element is
held in a well defined position. As will be seen from FIG.
2 the antenna element of the invention formed by element 33
and antennas 35 has a configuration similar to the letter S
when mounted to cover
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Antenna device for antitheft-appliancies (10, 11) of the
type affecting a magnetic field, comprising

an antenna element (33) and
two antennas (35) projecting from opposite sides of said

element and forming together with the element a
configuration similar to the letter S each bow of which

consists of two parallel first straight portions mutually
spaced transversely thereof, and a second straight portion

extending between one ends of said first portions, the other
ends of said first portions of each bow, located at opposite

sides of the S, each being connected to said antenna element
located therebetween, 
characterised
 in that each antenna
(35) consists of a wire, and that means (34, 36) are

provided on the backside of a cover (11) forming part of an anti-theft device (10, 11) defining the configuration
of the antenna wires and retaining the antenna element (33)

and the antennas on said substrate.
Antenna device as in claim 1, 
characterised
 in that said
means (34, 36) comprise projecting pins on said cover

(11).
