<ABSTRACT>
[Objective] 
Provide a light-weight, compact and low-cost 
four-cycle engine. 
[Configuration] 
A gear 11 on a crankshaft 10 is made to engage 
with an internal gear 21 having twice the number of 

teeth of the gear 11, cams 22 are formed on the 
exterior surface of the internal gear 21, and the cams 

22 are connected with valve actuating mechanisms 40 
for actuating an exhaust valve 44 and an intake valve 

40 to open or close. The gear 11, the internal gear 
21, etc. may have the additional function of an oil 

pump.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to four-cycle or
four-stroke engines, in particular small-sized engines
integrated into portable machines and the like.Engines integrated into portable machines such as
rush cutter and chain saw must be small in size and
light in weight. The Japanese Utility Provisional
Model Publication No. HEI-4-117103 describes a
small-sized four-cycle engine suited to such portable
machines. In four-cycle engines, the valves (an intake
valve and an exhaust valve) must be opened once each
while the crankshaft turns twice. A cam shaft,
therefore, for opening and closing the valves is
normally provided independent of a crankshaft. The cam
shaft receives power from the crankshaft via gears (a
crank gear and a cam gear), etc. and turns one half of
the number of turns of the crankshaft according to the
gear ratio of the gears or the like. Valve actuating
mechanisms such as push rods and rocker arms for valve
opening and closing are connected to the cams on the
cam shaft, and the intake valve and the exhaust valves
are opened and closed at the above-mentioned
frequencies. In the engine described in the
above-mentioned gazette, a cam shaft is provided
independent of the crankshaft. When a cam shaft is provided for opening and
closing valves, the number of parts of an engine will
increase by the number of the cam shaft and the
related gear, and the weight and size of the engine
will increase accordingly. Keeping this point in view,
the Japanese Patent Provisional Publication No.
SHO-61-229906 proposes a four-cycle engine wherein no
cam shaft is used to open or close the intake and
exhaust valves. Fig. 2 is a longitudinal sectional
view of the engine disclosed in the gazette or according to JP-A-61/229906. A special
guide portion 11' functioning as an equivalent of the
above-mentioned cam is formed on a crankshaft 10' and
one end of a valve actuating mechanism 40' is
connected (contact engagement) with the surface of the
guide portion 11'. The guide portion 11' is in the
form of a groove having a route that returns to the
starting point after two turns over the external
circumference of the crankshaft 10'. A profile
similar to a cam is made in the bottom of the groove,
said profile having various radii relative to the
center of rotation of the crankshaft (the profile
curve gives one cycle when turned twice). When the
crankshaft 10' is rotated, the valve actuating
mechanism 40' will be guided by the guide portion 11'
to make one action per two turns of the crankshaft
10'. Thus a valve 44' will be

A four stroke engine wherein

   a first gear (11) on a crankshaft (10) is made to
engage with a second, ring gear (20) having an

internal gear (21), cams (22) are formed on the
exterior surface of the ring gear (20), the cams (22)

are connected with valve actuating mechanisms (40) for
actuating an exhaust valve (44) and an intake valve to

open or close, and the crankshaft (10) is supported by
a crankcase cover (5) of the engine via a first

bearing (12) and by a crankcase (2) of the engine via
a second bearing (13), characterized in that the ring

gear (20) is fitted in a recess in the crankcase (2)
sealed by the crankcase cover (5), the ring gear (20)

being supported by respective adjacent portions of the
crankcase (2) and crankcase cover (5), and in that the

first and second bearings (12, 13) are placed across
the first gear (11) and ring gear (20) such that a

desired engagement condition is maintained between the
first gear (11) and the internal gear (21).
An engine as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
space between said first gear (11) and said internal

gear (21) is hermetically sealed and a member (39) for
bisecting the space is provided to form an oil pump

having a suction port (32) for lubricating oil 
provided in one of the bisected spaces and a discharge

port (33) provided in the other bisected space, at
least one lubricating oil route being connected to the

oil pump.
An engine as claimed in claim 2, wherein a said
oil route (35) is provided from the pump to the cams

(22) for forced lubrication of the cams (22).
An engine as claimed in claim 2 or 3, wherein a
said oil route (34) is provided from the pump to the

first bearing (12) for forced lubrication of the first
bearing (120).
An engine as claimed in claim 2, 3 or 4, wherein
a said oil route (35, 36) is provided from the pump to
