<ABSTRACT>
The moving contact (14, 14a, 14b) of a circuit breaker engages within an arc chute (32) up to the bottom of the U-shaped slots of the various plates or separators (34). The fixed contact (18, 20) is arranged in the vicinity of an end plate at the base of the slot confinement volume. This arrangement contributes to early cooling of the arc, which reduces the volume of gas while keeping the internal pressure at a moderate value. Application: low-voltage circuit breakers.
