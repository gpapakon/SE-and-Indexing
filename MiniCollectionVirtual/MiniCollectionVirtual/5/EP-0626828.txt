<ABSTRACT>
The present invention concerns a system for osteosynthesis along the spinal column, in particular for stabilizing spinal column segments. The system comprises at least one connecting rod (14); at least two retaining elements (12) each of which can be anchored to a spinal column segment and has a tuning-fork shaped head (15) whose two limbs (16, 17) define an approximately U-shaped receiving area (18) for the connecting rod (14); a clamping screw (19) which can be screwed into the receiving space (18) to secure the connecting rod (14) between the two limbs (16, 17) of the tuning-fork shaped screw head (15), the floor (22) of the receiving area (18) being concave to correspond to a pivot bearing (23) which is situated between the floor (22) of the receiving area (18) and the connecting rod (14) and whose bearing surface (24) facing the floor (22) of the receiving area (18) has a matching convex form. The bearing surface (24) of the pivot bearing (23) which faces the floor (22) of the receiving area (18) is bowl-shaped, in particular hemispherical. The opposing side which faces the clamping screw (19) when the unit is assembled is provided in addition with a groove (26) to accommodate the connecting rod (14).

the receiving cavity (18) by a retainer pin (28) with a 
proximally-disposed head (29) which can be pressed with its 

distal end (30) with a small degree of play through a slot 
(31) in the pivot bearing member (23) extending parallel to 

the receiving groove (26) for the rod-like connecting member 
(14), through into a corresponding receiving bore (32) on 

the base (22) of the receiving cavity 918), until its head
