<DESCRIPTION>
The present motor control circuit for series or 
compound starting shunt normal running relates to reach 
shunt operation with high efficiency and low loss under 
normal operation, and apply series or compound for starting 
or overload operation in order to obtain excellent starting 
or overload operation. FIG. 1 is a diagram showing the structure of motor 
control circuit for series or compound starting shunt normal 
running. FIG. 2 is an embodiment showing the present motor 
control circuit for series or compound starting shunt normal 
running consisted of C contact point switch. FIG. 3 is another embodiment showing the present motor 
control circuit for series or compound starting shunt normal 
running consisted of C contact point switch. FIG. 4 is an embodiment showing present motor control 
circuit for series or compound starting shunt normal running 
consisted of auxiliary field winding. The conventional series or compound motor often has 
excellent starting and overload characteristics, in other 
words having better current against moment, however its  
 
normal operation efficiency is inferior due to the drop of 
series field; while shunt motor is on the contrary, in other 
words, its efficiency is good under normal operation but 
current is too big during starting and overload. The present 
motor control circuit for series or compound starting shunt 
normal running relates to reach shunt operation with high 
efficiency and low loss under normal operation, and apply 
series or compound for starting or overload operation in 
order to obtain excellent starting or overload operation. The principle and structure of the circuit according to
