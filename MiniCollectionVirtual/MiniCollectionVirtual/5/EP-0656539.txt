<ABSTRACT>
A method in conjunction with gas analysis is described, 
whereby a gas sample is extracted from a gas to be analyzed 

with respect to one or a plurality of its gas components. 
The flow of the extracted gas sample is measured and a 

replacement gas is added to the gas in the same amount in 
order to minimize the impact on the gas of extraction of the 

gas sample. The replacement gas can advantageously consist 
of the gas components constituting the gas sample. A gas 

analyzer for performing the method is also described.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method by the analysis of 
a gas in which method a gas sample is diverted from a gas to 
be analyzed with respect to one or a plurality of its gas 
components. The present invention also relates to a gas analyzer. When a gas is to be analyzed, a sample of the gas is 
commonly diverted to a measuring unit, e.g. a gas analyzer. 
One such method and gas analyzer are described in US-A-4,509,359. 
The document describes a method in which a 
continuous gas sample is diverted from a breathing gas 
during the ventilation of a patient's lungs. The gas sample 
is sent to a gas analyzer in which the concentration of e.g. 
carbon dioxide or the like is determined. The gas sample is 
then discharged into ambient air or some collection container. Modern ventilators and respirators, such as e.g. the Servo 
Ventilator 300 from Siemens-Elema AB, Sweden, are able to 
control flows to/from a patient with great accuracy. They 
are also capable of regulating very small flows, a necessity 
e.g. in the treatment of neonatal children. With these 
ventilators, the removal of even a small gas sample will 
affect the flow to the patient and, in particular, will 
affect the regulation of inspiratory and expiratory flows. Devising a gas analyzer so a gas sample is extracted from 
the breathing gas and then returned to the breathing gas 
after measurement has been performed is prior art. However, 
some analysis procedures can affect and alter one or a 
plurality of component gases. For example, oxygen can be 
measured with a high-temperature electrochemical cell. Any 
anaesthetic gases mixed with the breathing gas might then be  
 
chemically altered. In such case, the analyzed gas cannot be 
returned to the breathing gas. One object of the invention is to set forth a method with 
which the above-described problems can be avoided. Another object of the invention is to set forth a gas analyzer 
for performing the method. The first object is achieved in accordance with the invention 
in that, in the method according to the above, the flow 
of the diverted gas sample is measured and a replacement gas 
is added to the gas with minimum delay and in the same 
quantity as the diverted gas sample. In this manner, the amount of the breathing gas in a 
ventilator is not affected when a gas sample for analysis is 
extracted from the breathing gas, e.g. during ventilation of 
a patient's lungs. The control of the inspiratory and 
exspiratory flows will therefore not be affected. Nor is 
there any risk of a
