<ABSTRACT>
A dermal composition comprising a drug, a multipolymer of 
ethylene-vinyl acetate, an acrylic polymer, and optionally one 

or more monomers, a natural or synthetic rubber and a 
tackifying agent. The ratio of the multipolymer to the rubber 

is, respectively, about 1:1 to about 10:1 and more preferably, 
1:1 to 5:1 and more preferably 3:1. The dermal composition can 

optionally contain a cross linking agent, tackifiers, 
penetration enhancers and other ingredients known for use in 

adhesives for the transdermal delivery of drugs. The dermal 
compositions can be produced by a variety of methods known in 

the preparation of drug containing adhesive preparations 
including the homogenous mixing of the multipolymer, drug and 

optional crosslinking agent and additional ingredients in 
solution or suspension or emulsion followed by removal of 

excess solvent.

<DESCRIPTION>
The use of a pressure sensitive adhesive containing a 
medicament, i.e., a drug, as a means of drug delivery through 
the skin at essentially a constant rate, is well known. Known delivery systems involve incorporation of a 
medicament into the pressure sensitive adhesive formulation. 
The pressure sensitive adhesive must adhere effectively to the 
skin and then permit migration of the medicament from the 
pressure sensitive adhesive through the skin and into the blood 
stream of the patient. Transdermal pressure sensitive adhesive formulations, such 
as nitrate vasodilators, may involve high concentrations (10 to 
40% by weight) of the medicament in the adhesive. This type 
and high concentration of medicament markedly reduces The 
desirable adhesion properties of the adhesive, particularly 
when the drug serves as a plasticizer, namely a solvent, for 
the adhesive. The result is a marked reduction in the cohesive  
 
strength of the adhesive. Thus, peel adhesion, tack and shear 
resistance suffer undesirably due to the medicament addition. 
The incorporation of crosslinking agents for reactive 
functional groups of the polymers may, for example, enhance the 
formulation's shear resistance, but at the expense of tack and 
peel adhesion. The use of presently marketed nitrate vasodilators in a 
pressure sensitive adhesive has been reported to frequently 
result in partial or total debonding, as early as during the 
first 24 hours of wearing by the patient. This debonding 
occurs as the patient perspires, exercises, or undertakes the 
normal physical activities expected in such a situation. The 
undesirable debonding result, In a reduced rate of medication 
delivery and a total dosage reduction proportional to the area 
of the device which is no longer in contact with the skin. A 
stronger adhesive, namely one having higher peel adhesion, 
shear resistance and tack, and in addition being perspiration 
resistant, would more effectively resist such undesirable 
debonding. Transdermal pressure sensitive adhesive formulations may 
also involve low concentrations (5% or less by weight) of the 
medicament in the adhesive. When an adhesive formulation 
containing a low concentration of the drug is used, although 
the lower concentration of the medicament in the adhesive does 
not critically affect the peel adhesion, tack and shear  
 
resistance of the formulation in the presence of sufficient 
plasticizer, difficulties are experienced in the release rate 
of the medicament from the adhesive. Previous adhesives
