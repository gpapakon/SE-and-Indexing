<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to 
a microwave energized 
process for the manufacture of semiconductor devices. Most specifically, the 
invention relates 
to a microwave energized 
plasma process in which bias of the plasma is controlled to 
influence the physical properties of a portion of at least 
one of the semiconductor layers comprising the device. Photovoltaic devices provide clean, quiet and 
reliable sources of electrical power and because of 
shortages and environmental problems associated with fossil 
and nuclear fuels and because of recent advances in 
technology which have significantly decreased the cost and 
increased the efficiencies of photovoltaic devices, 
photovoltaic power is of growing commercial importance. 
Initially photovoltaic devices were manufactured from 
single crystalline material. These devices were expensive, 
delicate, fairly bulky and difficult to manufacture in 
fairly large area configurations. Various techniques have 
now been developed for preparing thin film semiconductor 
materials which manifest electrical properties which are 
equivalent, and in many instances superior to, their single 
crystalline counterparts. These thin film materials may be  
 
readily deposited over very large areas and on a variety of 
substrates. Such alloys and techniques for their 
preparation are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent Nos. 
4,226,898 and 4,217,374. One important class of 
photovoltaic devices comprise a layer of intrinsic 
semiconductor interposed between two oppositely doped 
semiconductor layers. Such devices are termed P-I-N or N-I-P 
devices depending on the order of the layers and the 
two terms shall be used interchangeably herein. Glow discharge deposition comprises one 
particularly important class of techniques for the 
preparation of thin film semiconductor materials. In a 
glow discharge method a process gas, typically at 
subatmospheric pressures, is energized by an electrical 
field so as to produce a plasma comprised of ionized and/or 
otherwise activated species derived from the process gas. 
The plasma acts to produce a semiconductor deposit on a 
substrate maintained in proximity thereto. Initially, such 
glow discharge deposition processes were energized by 
direct current, or more commonly by alternating current in 
the radio frequency range. While such techniques produce 
high quality semiconductor materials deposition rates 
obtained thereby are fairly low and significant amounts of 
process gas are utilized non-productively. Attempts to
