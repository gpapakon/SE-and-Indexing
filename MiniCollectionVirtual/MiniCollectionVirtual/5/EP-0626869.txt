<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a metering device for use in transferring a desired volumetric dose of a flowable substance (132) from a storage chamber (133) containing the substance (132) to a location outside the chamber (133), via an outlet conduit (135) communicating between the chamber (133) and the location (129) to which the dose is to be transferred, the device being of such dimensions as to be able to pass through the outlet conduit (135) and having first and second end elements which, when the metering device is located inside the conduit (135) in use, are in sealing engagement with the inner walls of the conduit (135), the shape of the metering device between the first and second end elements being such that a space of the desired dose volume is defined between the first and second end elements and the intervening section of the inner walls of the conduit (135), in which space substance (132) from the storage chamber (133) may be enclosed. The device is of particular use in a dry power inhaler, and an inhaler incorporating the device also falls within the scope of the invention.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus according to the preamble of claim 1.
The
invention also relates, inter alia, to an inhaler
incorporating such an apparatus.It is often necessary to transfer an accurate volume of a
substance from a storage chamber containing that substance
to another location, but it is not always easy to effect the
transfer accurately and efficiently. In particular, it is
often desired to transfer a powdered medicament from a
storage chamber to an inhalation passage in a dry powder
inhaler.Powder inhalers, which deliver a drug in a dry, finely
divided form, have been shown to give certain medical
advantages over other forms of delivery system. In
particular, they are more popular than inhalers which propel
a drug in pressurised gas from an aerosol, because of
environmental and other considerations.EP-079478, EP-166294, EP-424790 and GB-2165159 disclose examples of dry
powder inhalers which include a medicament storage chamber
and an inhalation passage through which air is drawn via a
mouthpiece. A metering member provided with a metering 
recess takes a dose of medicament from the storage chamber
and deposits it in the inhalation passage.It is considered that the accuracy of such arrangements can
be very poor: on the one hand, by repeated indexing of the
metering member it is possible to deposit two or more doses
of medicament into the inhalation passage, resulting in the
administration to the user of an overdose of medicament; on
the other hand, since the medicament normally drops from the
metering recess into the inhalation passage under gravity,
particles of medicament can adhere to the interior of the
metering recess so that an underdose is delivered.US-2587215 discloses dry powder inhalers with the same
disadvantages as those mentioned above. However, this
document also discloses an embodiment in which the metering
member presents the medicament in an upwardly open
dispensing cup to a mixing chamber, where it is mixed with
air before being sucked into an inhalation tube via a nozzle
having a narrow opening. Air sucked into the inhaler passes
into the inhalation tube either directly or through the
mixing chamber and nozzle. Accordingly, not all the air
passes over the dispensing cup. If medicament adheres to
the surface of the dispensing cup but is not sucked
therefrom, an underdose of medicament will be delivered to
the user. Upon repeated use of a dispensing cup to deliver
doses to the inhalation tube, a continually increasing
amount of the medicament powder can adhere to

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for dispensing a plurality of desired volumetric doses of a flowable
substance comprising a storage chamber (21) for the substance and an outlet

conduit (7) communicating with the chamber, characterised by a plurality of
metering devices (3), each metering device (3) having first and second end

elements (15a) adapted to seal against the inner walls of the conduit (7) so as
to define an intermediate dosing space of the desired dose 
volume (V
I
) and
means for advancing the metering devices (3) in series from within the

storage chamber (21) into the outlet conduit (7) so as to cause substance
surrounding each device (3) in the storage chamber to pass with the device (3)

into the conduit (7) in the respective dosing space.
Apparatus according to Claim 1 in which the means for advancing the
metering devices (3) is adapted to maintain the metering devices (3)

substantially free from contact with the walls of the storage chamber (21)
while they are advanced through it.
Apparatus according to Claim 1 or Claim 2 in which each metering device
comprises a body (15) in the form of a spool.
Apparatus according to any one of Claims 1-3 in which the devices are
attached to one another in a flexible or semi-flexible chain (3).
Apparatus according to Claim 4 in which the first end element (15a) of one
device in the series also serves as the second end element (15a) of the

preceding device in the series, such that the desired volume (V
I
) is defined
between two successive end elements (15a) as successive devices in the series

pass through the outlet conduit (7). 
Apparatus according to Claim 4 or Claim 5 in which the devices are arranged
in a continuous series, such that as the series passes through the outlet conduit

(7), the only substance transferred with it is that trapped between the end
elements (15a) of successive devices, there being no spaces between an end

element (15a) of one device and the next end element (15a) of the next device
in the series.
An inhaler for delivering a substance in a finely divided form including
apparatus according to any one of Claims 1 to 6 and further comprising air

intake means (20) by which air may be drawn into the inhaler from the
atmosphere and an inhalation passage (8) communicating with the air intake

means (20), through which passage (8) air may be drawn using the air intake
means (20), and in which inhaler the outlet conduit (7) communicates

between the storage chamber (21) and the inhalation passage (8) and the
means for advancing the metering devices includes indexing means

releasing the first device for subsequent passage through the inhaler, and

second engaging means (2,12) for engaging the series of metering devices
following release of the first metering device by the first engaging means, so
