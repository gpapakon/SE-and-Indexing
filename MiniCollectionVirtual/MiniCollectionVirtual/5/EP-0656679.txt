<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the present invention is a small electric motor, cooled by a flow of air passing through the rotor, comprising a rotor having longitudinal through ducts and equipped, above and below, with two small radial vanes which respectively form two moving centrifuge parts which suck in air, one situated above and the other below the rotor.

<CLAIMS>
An electric induction motor cooled by an air flow passing
through the rotor of the type including an annular stator (2)

with inductor winding (2a), a suction fan (7) fixed on the shaft
(6), a rotor (1) provided with a series of longitudinal ducts (1c)

and at the top and at the bottom with an annular series of
radial suction blades (1a and 1b), a casing (3) housing the

rotor (1) and provided on its bottom with slots (3b and 3c)
characterised in that said cylindrical casing (3) consists of two

semi-cylindrical shells and a diameter designed to create
around each series of radial blades (1a and 1b) an annular

duct with constant cross-section; the annular duct (4) which
surrounds the top series of radial blades (1a) entering a

channel (5a) delimited by a box-shaped lid (5) in part covering
the winding (2a) of the stator (2); said annular duct (4) being

obstructed by a transverse baffle plate (4b) positioned
downstream from its exit mouth (4a).
An electric induction motor according to the previous
claim characterised in that the two series of radial blades (1a

and 1b) are obtained by shaping the lamellar unit constituting
the body of the rotor (1).
