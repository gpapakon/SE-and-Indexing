<ABSTRACT>
To hold constant the desired light output of a high or 
low pressure gas discharge lamp in cold operation, the 

current through the gas discharge lamp is measured and the 
difference with a desired reference value is determined. On 

the basis of the measured difference the frequency is 
controlled of a high frequency alternating voltage which is 

generated by a continuously variable oscillator. When 
current flow through the lamp is too low the frequency is 

lowered, whereby the resistance in the branch in which the 
lamp is arranged is decreased and the current flow is 

increased until the desired value is reached.

<DESCRIPTION>
The light output in gas discharge lamps is to a large 
degree dependent on ambient influences such as degree of 
humidity, temperature and the like. At low temperatures to 
below freezing point a gas discharge lamp starts with 
difficulty or not at all. When the temperature falls the 
passage of current through the lamp then becomes lower and 
light output decreases. It is desired for many purposes to obtain a constant 
light output under changing conditions. This is for instance 
the case in lighting of plants in order to enhance the 
growth thereof. It is further desired during use in greatly 
varying conditions, for instance in the use of street 
lighting, to be able to ensure a constant light output over 
a large temperature range. This is achieved according to the invention by a device 
for controlling to a desired value the light output of a 
high or low pressure gas discharge lamp in cold operation, 
with means for generating from a supply voltage a high 
frequency alternating voltage for supplying a gas discharge 
lamp over a frequency-dependent resistance, means for 
controlling the frequency of the high frequency alternating 
voltage, means for generating an adjustable reference value, 
means for measuring the current through the gas discharge 
lamp, means for determining a difference in the reference 
value and the measured current value and means for actuating 
the means for controlling the frequency of the high 
frequency alternating voltage on the basis of a measured 
difference. Through feedback of the lamp current and the comparison 
with the reference value thereof the frequency of the high 
frequency alternating voltage can be controlled with the  
 
difference between both values. At a lower current flow the 
resistance in the branch in which the lamp is arranged can 
herein be lowered by a lower frequency and the current flow 
therefore increased. Using the device according to the invention starting 
and holding of a gas discharge lamp at a nominal light 
output operation can be ensured over a large temperature 
range. The means for controlling the frequency of the high 
frequency alternating voltage are preferably formed by a 
voltage-controlled continuously variable oscillator. The frequency-dependent resistance is preferably a 
choking coil. The reference value can be derived from a digital 
control signal or from an audio signal which can be 
transferred for instance to the mains supply network. This 
latter control option can find particular application in a 
system of public
