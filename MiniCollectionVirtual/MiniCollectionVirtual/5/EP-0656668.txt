<ABSTRACT>
This electrode uses a carbon fiber whose crystallites are 13 to 17 angstrom thick according to X-ray 
diffractometry. In a method for manufacturing the cell electrode using the carbon fiber, the carbon fiber is burned at 

a temperature between 900 °C and 1,330 °C. It is possible to provide a secondary cell having the characteristics of 
the carbon fiber and a high discharging capacitance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrode for
batteries and to a rechargeable secondary battery using
the same.With wide spreading of portable devices such as
video cameras and note type personal computers, compact
and high capacity secondary batteries are more and more
demanded. Most of the secondary batteries presently used
are nickel-cadmium batteries using alkaline electrolytic
solutions. However, these conventional batteries have a
low battery voltage of about 1.2 V and it is difficult to
promote energy density. To overcome this problem, high
energy secondary batteries employing lithium metal having
the poorest potential have been studied.However, with the secondary batteries employing
lithium metal as the anode, the lithium grows in the form
of branches of a tree (dendrite) as a result of
repetition of charging and discharging, the batteries
have a danger to fire because of short circuit. Further,
since lithium metal having high activity is used, the
batteries are intrinsically dangerous and so problematic
for personal uses. Recently, lithium ion secondary
batteries employing various materials made of carbon 
which overcome the problem on safety and which exhibit
high energy characteristic to lithium batteries were
proposed. These batteries exploit the fact that the
carbon material is doped with lithium ions and becomes
the same potential as lithium metal so that it can be
used as an anode in place of lithium metal. The
batteries employing the carbon material doped with
lithium ion are free from the problem of formation of
dendrite and are highly safe because lithium metal is not
used at all, so that they are now actively studied.Secondary batteries employing the electrodes which
utilize the doping of lithium ion to carbon material are
described in, for example, Japanese Laid-open Patent
Application (Kokai) Nos. 62-90863 and 62-122066. The
carbon material employed in these known batteries is in
the form of powder, so that a polymer binder such as
Teflon or vinylidene fluoride is needed to form an
electrode. However, if carbon fibers or a structure made
of carbon fibers are used as the carbon material in place
of the carbon powder, the electrode can be constructed
without using the binder and with a small amount of
carbon material. Further, in view of the chemical
stability to electrolytes, structural stability to volume
expansion due to the doping, and characteristics on
repetition of charging and discharging, it is said that
carbon fibers and structures made of carbon fibers are
excellent.
