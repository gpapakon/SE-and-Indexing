<ABSTRACT>
Provided is a process for producing a semiconductor 
silicon wafer by which an intrinsic gettering effect can be 

improved and at the same time the top side can be made free 
from faults. A silicon ingot is produced and sliced to 

obtain silicon wafers. Then, a polycrystal silicon 
depositing film is formed on one side of a silicon wafer, 

which is subjected to a heat treatment in an inert gas, a 
reducing gas or a mixture thereof to discharge oxygen from 

the vicinity of the other side. Alternatively, after 
discharging oxygen from the silicon wafer by a heat 

treatment, a polycrystal silicon depositing film may be 
formed on one side of the silicon wafer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
producing a semiconductor silicon wafer. Particularly, the
present invention relates to a semiconductor silicon wafer
having not only a high gettering ability but also a denuded
zone on the top side (surface) thereof, and to a process
for producing it.Semiconductor silicon wafers are obtained by slicing a
silicon ingot into wafers, and then various heat treatments
are effected on the thus obtained semiconductor silicon
wafers in the device processes.A variety of gettering techniques are used to let metal
contaminations, which were introduced into a semiconductor
silicon wafer in the device processes, be captured in a
region other than an element active region. The gettering
techniques are classified into two large groups.One of them is an intrinsic gettering (hereinafter
referred to as "IG") process as shown in Fig. 12A, which
utilizes precipitates of oxygen contained in the semiconductor
silicon wafer in an amount of about 1×1018 (cm-3) as
formed in the heat treatments. With heat treatments at a
high temperature, at a low temperature and at a medium
temperature in this order, outward diffusion of surface
oxygen in semiconductor silicon wafer, nucleus formation
for precipitates of oxygen and growth of oxygen precipitates
occur, whereby the oxygen precipitates are formed
only inside the semiconductor silicon wafer. An IG
semiconductor silicon wafer is thus obtained with an
element active region on the top side being a denuded zone.
Although IG is generally known to have a higher gettering
ability as compared with extrinsic gettering (hereinafter
referred to as "EG") described below, it is extremely
difficult to make the denuded zone on the top side completely 
free from faults.The most generally used EG is a sand-blasting method,
in which fine scars having a size of about 1 µm or less are
formed by bombarding the back side of the semiconductor
silicon wafer with fine silicon particles. Then, the
semiconductor silicon wafer thus obtained is oxidized to
cause oxidation-induced stacking faults (OSF) or
dislocation from the scars, so that the back side of the
semiconductor silicon wafer becomes metal gettering sites
(Fig. 12B). However, silicon (Si) could be peeled off in
a scar portion so as to produce fine dust.A recent method drawing attention as EG with high
gettering ability is a process for producing a
semiconductor silicon wafer having (polycrystalline) silicon on
the back side. This is a process in which polycrystalline
silicon is deposited by the vapor
