<ABSTRACT>
In a transfer station, the healds are distributed from heald holders (24) forming part of a distributing station onto carrier rails (17). Provided for each carrier rail (17) are a lock having two spaced controlled clamps (K1, K2), a transfer member (39) and a slide (19). The transfer member (39) transports the healds (LI) from the heald holder (24) through the first clamp (K1), adjacent to the latter, into the space between the clamps (K1, K2), where an intermediate storage of the healds (LI) takes place. The transport of the healds (LI) through the second clamp (K2) takes place by means of the slide (19). Use for the processing of healds having closed end loops.

Apparatus for the selective transfer of healds 
from a distribution station of a warp-thread drawing-in 

machine to heald carrier rails (14), with a heald holder 
(24) which forms part of the distribution station and on 

which the healds (LI) are held individually, and with a 
transfer station (TS) which is assigned to the heald 

carrier rails and has transfer members (39) and past 
which the heald holder is guided, characterized in that 

there are provided in the region of the transfer station 
(TS), for each carrier rail (14), a lock having two 

spaced clamps (K
1
, K
2
) controlled so as to hold the 
carrier rail and a slide (19) for displacing the healds 

(LI) on the carrier rail, and in that the clamps are 
opened alternately, the transport of the healds through 

the clamp (K
1
) adjacent to the heald holder (24) taking 
place by means of the respective transfer member (39) and 

through the other clamp (K
2
) by means of the slide. 
Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the heald carrier rails (14) have, in the region of 

the transfer station (TS), an entry part which is formed 
by an adaptor rail (17) and which is held by the clamps 

(K
1
, K
2
) and is provided for the intermediate storage of 
the healds (LI). 
Apparatus according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that each of the two clamps (K
1
, K
2
) can be jointly 
actuated respectively for a plurality of, preferably for 

all, the adaptor rails (17). 
Apparatus according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that each of the two clamps (K
1
, K
2
) has a stop block 
(41) and a clamping rake (44) which are both arranged 

transversely to the adaptor rails (17) and which are each 
connected to a common drive. 
Apparatus according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that the stop block (41) and the clamping rake (44) run 

into one another and are driven in opposite directions. 
Apparatus according to Claim 5, characterized in 
that the stop block (41) has a stop tooth (42) for each  

 
adaptor rail (17) and the clamping rake (44) has a 

corresponding number of clamping teeth (45). 
Apparatus according to Claim 6, characterized in 
that the stop teeth (42) have flat shape, and in that the 

clamping rake (44) is guided in slot-like recesses (43) 
of the stop teeth. 
Apparatus according to Claim 7, characterized in 
that the stop teeth (42) have positioning bolts (40) 

which are provided for engagement into corresponding 
centring bores of the adaptor rails (17). 
Apparatus according to one of Claims 2 to 8, 
characterized in that the adaptor rails (17), at their 

entry end adjacent to the heald holders (24), terminate 
in a nose (36) which engages under the tips of the heald 

holders. 
Apparatus according to Claim 9, characterized in 
that the adaptor rails (17) have a stepped portion at 

their exit end and terminate at their top edge in a web 
(37) which projects beyond the stepped portion and which 

engages over the connected heald carrier rail (14). 
Apparatus according to Claim 10, characterized in 
that the heald carrier rails (14) are connected to the 

adaptor rails (17) by means of a transitional spring (38) 
arranged in the region of the said stepped portion. 
Apparatus according to Claim 11, characterized in 
that the transitional spring (38) is designed as an 

exchangeable part which can be handled manually. 
Apparatus according to one of Claims 2 to 8, 
characterized in that the slides (19) are of finger-like 

design and are driven by a common slide carriage (47). 
Apparatus according to Claim 13, characterized in 
that the slides (19) have a leg extending parallel to the 

adaptor rails (17), and in that a pivotable flap (48) is 
mounted resiliently on this leg. 
Apparatus according to Claim 14, characterized in 
that the pivotable flap (48) is designed, on the one 

hand, as a slide member for the healds (LI) in the 
direction of transport (B) and, on the other hand, as a 

member securing them against displacement in the opposite  
 

direction and, for this purpose, has a sawtooth like 
shape. 
Apparatus according to one of Claims 2 to 8, 
characterized in that, during the normal operation of the 

drawing-in machine with a continuous distribution of the 
healds (LI) to the carrier rails (14), the clamp (K
1
) 
adjacent to the heald holder (24) is opened and the other 

clamp (K
2
) is closed. 
Apparatus according to Claim 16, characterized in 
that the change-over between the clamps (K
1
, K
2
) takes 
place on the basis of the number of healds (LI) intermediately 

stored on the adaptor rails (17).
