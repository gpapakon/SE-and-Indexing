<ABSTRACT>
A wheel suspension for a vehicle wheel (14) is supported by a wheel carrier (1) which is guided in vertically movable fashion relative to a vehicle frame by guiding and springing means, and the wheel suspension has a degree of freedom which allows the wheel carrier (1) to perform a pivoting movement in a transverse plane of the vehicle about a transverse axis running in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle, this axis of rotation running approximately in the centre of the vehicle wheel - in relation to the width of the latter - and approximately at the height of the plane of the roadway. The two degrees of freedom of the vehicle wheel (14) are achieved by means of a three-dimensional coupler.

Wheel suspension for a vehicle wheel (14) supported

by a wheel carrier (1) which, with reference to a vehicle
chassis, is vertically movable by guiding and spring

means, with the wheel suspension of each axle half showing
an extra degree of freedom, allowing the wheel carrier (1)

a swivel movement in a vehicle transversal plane around a
pivoting axis oriented in vehicle longitudinal direction,

with this pivoting axis running roughly along the center
line of the vehicle wheel (14) - with reference to its

width -, 
characterized
 in that this pivoting
axis, with reference to its height, is located below the

road surface l, with the wheel suspension featuring two
upper links (4, 5) and two lower links (2, 3), with the

pivoting points (8, 10 and 9, 11) of the upper links (4, 5)
being arranged in a manner that two straight lines run parallel

to each other and pass in horizontal direction
through to the pivoting points (8 and 10) and through the

pivoting points (9 and 11), and that the imaginary extension
of the lower links (2, 3) intersects in a certain point

the turning axis of the pivotal movement below the road
surface.
Wheel suspension according to claim 1,
characterized
 in that the wheel carrier (1)
is made of hollow sections. 
Wheel suspension according to claim 1,
characterized
 in that the upper links (4, 5)
are much longer than the lower links (2, 3).
Wheel suspension according to claim 3,
characterized
 in that the upper links (4, 5)
are at least three times as long as the lower links (2, 3).
Wheel suspension according to claim 1,
characterized
 in that the vehicle wheel is
provided with twin tires (14) or one wide-base tire.
Wheel suspension according to claim 1,
characterized
 in that the upper links (4, 5)
are connected to the vehicle chassis by molecular joints.
Wheel suspension according to claim 1,
characterized
 in that the lower links (2, 3)
are arranged at a particular angle to the road surface,

with their imaginary exten-sions intersecting at a certain
point within a range from 0 to 100 mm in front of the wheel

contact and within a range from 50 to 150 mm below the
wheel contact plane.
Wheel suspension according to claim 1,
characterized
 in that dampers (15, 16) are
arranged in driving direction in front of the vehicle wheel

(14) and between the lower links (2, 3). 
Wheel suspension according to claim 1,
characterized
 in that a stabilizer (17) is
connected with the wheel suspension (1) by an intermediate

link (18).
Wheel suspension according to claim 1,
characterized
 in that a stabilizer is fixed
directly to the wheel carrier (1).
Wheel suspension according to claim 1,
characterized
 in that an intermediate-link
(18) center line through the pivoting points (19, 20) intersects

the momentary rotation axis of the vehicle wheel
(14) in design position.
Wheel suspension according to claim 1,
characterized
 in that the wheel suspension is
maneuvrable.
Wheel suspension according to claims 9 or 10,
characterized
 in that the stabilizer (18)
shows a plane inertia torque in at least in one position

(23) transverse to the travelling direction, which is considerably
lower than the plane inertia torque longitudinal

to the travelling direction.
