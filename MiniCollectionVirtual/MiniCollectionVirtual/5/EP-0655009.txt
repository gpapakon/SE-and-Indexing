<ABSTRACT>
A novel method of entering a pictorial competition of the type in which the position of an object omitted from a picture is required to be identified is in the form of a sheet (10, 32) on which one or more crosses or the like are displayed, the crosses being applied to a pictorial entry coupon (20) in the position selected by the entrant. The crosses may be in the form of transferable markings on the sheet or the sheet itself, bearing the crosses, may be adhesively secured to the coupon by the entrant.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to competitions 
of the well-known "Spot the Ball" type, wherein a 
competition entrant is required to place a cross 
upon a pictorial entry coupon to indicate, in the 
judgment of the entrant, the position of an object, 
for example the centre of a football notionally 
missing from the picture, which often consists of 
an action photograph from which the object has been 
deleted. In such competitions, the entrant may usually 
mark the cross with ink, which may smudge or may, 
because of the width of the marking, give an 
imprecise indication of the intended position. 
Most entrants attempt to optimise their chances of 
success by placing a large number of crosses in 
what they consider to be the relevant area and, 
with that in mind, organisers of competitions may 
allow entrants to place, say, 500 crosses for an 
entry fee of as little as, say, Â£2.00. To 
facilitate entry on this scale, rubber stamps  
 
have now become readily available, by means of which 
an entrant is able to print many crosses 
simultaneously. In practice, however, these rubber 
stamps have proved to be far from satisfactory. As 
the crosses are very close together, a clear 
impression is not obtained unless the rubber stamp is 
kept spotlessly clean. Even then, unless the rubber 
stamp is uniformly coated with the right amount of 
ink, and unless it is applied to the entry coupon on a 
perfectly flat surface, for example a sheet of glass, 
some of the crosses may not be printed clearly or at 
all. Furthermore, entrants who have unsteady hands 
or impaired vision also have difficulty in using a 
rubber stamp effectively. An object of the present invention is to provide 
a method of making multiple entries to a pictorial 
competition, and also means and apparatus for 
conducting such a competition, whereby some at least 
of the disadvantages of prior such competitions are 
reduced or avoided. The method according to the invention of entering 
a pictorial competition of the foregoing type 
comprises applying together a multiplicity of crosses 
or the like displayed on a sheet to the entry coupon 
in the desired position. The competition entry means according to the  
 
invention comprises a sheet on which there is 
displayed a multiplicity of crosses or the like, the 
sheet having an adhesive coating on one side thereof 
and thereby being adapted to apply the crosses or the 
like to a pictorial competition entry coupon in a 
desired position so as to display the crosses or the 
like on the coupon. The

<CLAIMS>
A method of making multiple entries to a pictorial 
competition of the type wherein an entrant is required 

to indicate the notional position of an object in a 
picture on an entry coupon (24), which method 

comprises applying together a multiplicity of crosses 
or the like displayed on a sheet (10; 32) to the entry 

coupon (24). 
A method as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the 
crosses or the like are transferred from the sheet to 

the coupon. 
A method as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the 
crosses or the like are applied by adhesively securing 

the sheet (10; 32) to the coupon (24). 
Competition entry means comprising a sheet (10; 
32) on which there is displayed a multiplicity of 

crosses or the like, the sheet having an adhesive 
coating on one side thereof and thereby being adapted 

to apply the crosses or the like to a pictorial 
competition entry coupon (24) in a desired position so 

as to display the crosses or the like on the coupon. 
Competition entry means as claimed in Claim 4, 
wherein a plurality of sheets (10) are provided upon a 

common backing (12).  
 
Competition entry means as claimed in either of 
Claims 4 and 5, wherein a plurality of said sheets are 

interconnected separably by perforations. 
Apparatus for conducting a pictorial competition, 
comprising a pictorial entry coupon (24), a sheet (32) 

on which there is displayed a multiplicity of crosses 
or the like, the sheet being adapted to apply the 

crosses or the like together to the pictorial entry 
coupon, and rules (30) specifying that the winner of 

the competition is the entrant who applies the crosses 
or the like from the sheet to, or most nearly to, a 

particular position on the entry coupon determined by 
said rules. 
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 7, wherein said 
pictorial entry coupon and said sheet are separate. 
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 7, wherein said 
sheet is removably attached to said entry coupon or to 

an extension thereof. 
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 9, wherein said 
pictorial entry coupon (20) is in two parts (22, 24), 

to one of which (22) said sheet (32) is attached.  
 
Apparatus as claimed in any of Claims 7 to 10, 
wherein each said sheet (10) is transparent. 
Apparatus as claimed in any of Claims 7 to 11, 
comprising a plurality of different said sheets (10; 

32), having different numbers of crosses. 
Apparatus as claimed in any of Claims 7 to 12, 
wherein said entry coupon (24) is in the form of a 

photograph (28) from which a feature has been removed.
