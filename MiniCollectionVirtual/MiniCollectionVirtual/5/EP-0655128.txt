<ABSTRACT>
A spectroscopic system for the analysis of small and very small quantities of substances makes use for the purposes of energy transfer of cone-shaped aperture changers (14, 15) which are arranged in the object zone (8) between the light source (L) and the sample (9) and, during absorption measurements, also between the sample (9) and the inlet slot (3) of a spectrometer (1). If the form used is a double cone, the aperture changers (14, 15) facilitate an oblique coupling in a capillary tube accepting the sample (9) which acts as a step-waveguide for the coupled radiation.
