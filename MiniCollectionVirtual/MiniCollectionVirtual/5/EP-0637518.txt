<ABSTRACT>
A decorative board comprising an inorganic substrate 
comprising an inorganic material other than a metal or a 

glass and having an organic or inorganic layer on a surface 
thereof, the substrate having consecutively thereon (1) a 

transfer base layer comprising a polyol-curing polyurethane 
resin, which is transparent or contains a colorant so as to 

have a color with hiding properties; (2) a transfer-printed 
layer having a pattern; and (3) a topcoat layer comprising a 

polyol-curing polyurethane resin.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a decorative board 
for use as an inner or outer wall material or panel material 
for a house or in interior or exterior house decoration, 
etc., which decorative board has a highly attractive 
appearance and a high degree of water resistance. A method of producing a conventional decorative board 
for use as a panel material for inner walls, ceilings, etc. 
of a house or in interior house decoration or other 
applications is disclosed in, e.g., JP-B-59-1111 and 
JP-B-60-58717, in which method a polyol-curing polyurethane 
resin coating composition is used and a decorative pattern is 
formed by transfer. (The term "JP-B" as used herein means an 
"examined Japanese patent publication.") Since a distinct and delicate colored pattern is 
obtained by this technique, the decorative board obtained is 
of high decorative value. However, the application of this technique to an 
inorganic substrate made of neither a metal nor a glass, such 
as an autoclaved calcium silicate board (slate board), has 
had a drawback that since the polyol-curing polyurethane 
resin coating composition applied infiltrates partially into 
the substrate because of the high porosity of the substrate,  
 
a transfer ink cannot be transferred in a sufficient amount 
and this not only is apt to result in an indistinct pattern 
but also gives a decorative board that after a water 
resistance test (immersion at 50Â°C for 240 hours) undergoes 
coating film peeling due to the cohesive failure of the 
substrate. An object of the present invention is to overcome the 
conventional drawback in application to inorganic substrates 
made of inorganic materials other than a metal or a glass, 
and to provide a decorative board combining a highly 
attractive appearance and high performance, that is, good in 
both ink transferability and water resistance. Other objects and effects of the present invention 
will be apparent from the following description. That is, ink transferability and water resistance 
have been imparted by disposing a transfer base layer formed 
from a polyol-curing polyurethane resin coating composition 
which is transparent or contains a colorant so as to have any 
desired color with hiding properties, a transfer-printed 
layer having a desired pattern, and a topcoat layer formed 
from a polyol-curing polyurethane resin coating composition, 
on an inorganic substrate having an organic or inorganic 
layer on the surface thereof. The present invention relates to a decorative board 
comprising an
