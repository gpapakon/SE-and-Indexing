<ABSTRACT>
A hydrocarbon mixture comprising olefins and isoparaffins is 
contacted with a catalyst mixture obtained by mixing sulfolane, which 

contains water, and HF. In a first separation zone, the reaction product 
is separated from the catalyst mixture. A portion of the separated 

catalyst mixture is further separated to obtain an overhead comprising a 
portion of the HF and a portion of the water, and a bottom stream 

comprising a portion of the sulfolane and a portion of the reaction 
by-product. The remaining portion of the separated catalyst mixture and 

a portion of the second separation overhead are reused as a part of the 
catalyst mixture; the remaining part of the second overhead is further 

processed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hydrocarbon conversion 
process. More particularly, the invention relates to a process for the 
alkylation of olefin hydrocarbons by isoparaffin hydrocarbons which 
utilizes a catalyst mixture comprising a sulfone compound, a hydrogen 
halide compound and water. It has recently been discovered that a mixture, comprising a 
sulfone compound and a hydrogen halide compound, can be an effective 
catalyst for use in the alkylation of olefin hydrocarbons by isoparaffin 
hydrocarbons to produce an alkylate reaction product, or alkylate. The 
alkylate reaction product generally contains hydrocarbons having seven or 
more carbon atoms, and it is a highly desirable gasoline blending component 
because of its high octane value as a motor fuel. While a process which utilizes a catalyst composition comprising 
a sulfone component and a hydrogen halide component produces an alkylate 
product of very high quality, one side effect from using such a process in 
the production of alkylate is the formation of certain polymeric reaction 
by-products such as those referred to as acid-soluble oils, or ASO. These 
polymeric reaction by-products are referred to as acid-soluble oils because  
 
they are soluble in the catalyst utilized in the alkylation process and, 
thus, remain in the catalyst phase when the alkylate product resulting from 
the contact of a hydrocarbon mixture with an alkylation catalyst is 
separated from the alkylation catalyst. In an alkylation process which 
continuously separates the catalyst phase from the alkylation reaction 
product for reuse in the process reaction zone, there is a buildup of ASO 
in the catalyst. Over time, the ASO concentration will reach unacceptable 
concentration levels if not removed. A low concentration of ASO in the 
alkylation catalyst comprising a sulfone component and a hydrogen halide 
component is believed to have a beneficial effect upon the alkylation 
process or its product. However, higher concentrations of ASO in the 
alkylation catalyst have an adverse effect upon the catalyst activity and 
the final alkylate end-product. An ASO concentration in the alkylation 
catalyst that exceeds certain acceptable limits will result in lowering the 
octane of the alkylate end-product with incremental increases in the ASO 
concentration causing incremental decreases in the alkylate octane. In a continuous alkylation process which uses a catalyst having a 
sulfolane component and a hydrogen fluoride component, there can be an 
undesirable

<CLAIMS>
An alkylation process, comprising the steps of: 

(a) mixing sulfolane having a concentration of water with HF to 
form a catalyst mixture comprising sulfolane, water and HF; 
(b) contacting a hydrocarbon mixture, comprising olefins and 
isoparaffins, with said catalyst mixture within a reaction zone to thereby 

produce a reaction product and a reaction by-product; 
(c) separating said reaction product from said catalyst mixture 
within a first separation zone to produce a separated reaction product and 

a separated catalyst mixture with said separated catalyst mixture 
containing a portion of said reaction by-product; 
(d) passing a portion of said separated catalyst mixture to a 
second separation zone to thereby separate said portion of said separated 

catalyst mixture into a second separation zone overhead stream, comprising 
a portion of the HF component of said portion of said separated catalyst 

mixture and a portion of the water component of said portion of said 
separated catalyst mixture, and a second separation zone bottoms stream, 

comprising a portion of the sulfolane component of said portion of said 
separated catalyst mixture and a portion of the reaction by-product 

component of said portion of said separated catalyst mixture; 
(e) utilizing a remaining portion of said separated catalyst 
mixture as a portion of said catalyst mixture; 
(f) condensing said second separation zone overhead stream to 
produce a condensed second separation zone overhead stream; 
(g) utilizing a portion of said condensed second separation zone 
overhead stream as a portion of said catalyst mixture; and
