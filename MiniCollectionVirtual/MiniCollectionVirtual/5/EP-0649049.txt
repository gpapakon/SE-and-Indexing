<ABSTRACT>
The wavelength converting device comprises a BBO crystal of 
length L along the propagation direction of incident light C 

and a filter transmitting only light E by second harmonic 
generation. The BBO crystal is composed of 10 pieces of 

crystal equally divided in parallel planes along the 
propagating direction of the light. Each crystal piece has a 

crystal axis respectively and is positioned with the crystal 
angle satisfying a phase matching condition for second 

harmonic generation and so that the adjacent crystal axis is 
oriented in a crystallographically different way. The 

acceptance angle  in the insensitive direction becomes the 
same as the acceptance angle ϑ in the sensitive direction; 

therefore, there is no necessity for gathering light to an 
oval shape, and maximum conversion efficiency can be obtained 

by gathering light with a conventional spherical lens.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a wavelength converting 
device, and more specifically to a wavelength converting 
device that extracts light, as the emitting light, converted 
to a predetermined wavelength from the oscillating wavelength 
of the incident light by a non-linear optical effect. There have been wavelength converting devices that obtain 
ultraviolet rays of converted wavelength from the fundamental 
continuous visible laser beam by converting the wavelength 
using non-linear optical materials, such as uniaxial crystal, 
having optical anisotropy (non-linear optical effect). For 
example, it has been common practice to convert the 
wavelength of the light from second harmonic generation (SHG) 
using non-linear optical materials such as β-barium borate 
(BBO). In the wavelength conversion of light from SHG, various nonlinear 
optical materials are used depending on the wavelength 
and power of the incident light. This is because of the 
necessity to satisfy the phase matching condition as well as 
the requirement to use non-linear optical materials with 
greater effectiveness. For the sake of simplicity, the following explanation of the 
wavelength conversion uses the case of SHG. However, the 
situation is the same in sum frequency generation and 
difference frequency generation. When the incident light 
consists of two wavelength components, the wavelength of the 
emitting light is the sum of both in the former generation,  
 
while it is the difference between them in the latter 
generation. Once the non-linear optical materials to be used and the 
wavelength of the incident light are decided for obtaining 
SHG light with the desired wavelength, the maximum wavelength 
conversion efficiency factor γ is derived, and the light 
power P2 for the new wavelength resulting from the conversion 
is expressed on the basis of incident power P1 as the 
following equation (1). 
P2 = γ · p1² The above equation, however, is applicable only when P2 is 
sufficiently small compared to P1; as P2 approaches P1, the 
actual light power has a smaller value than P2. In addition, 
the above equation is valid only on the condition that the 
crystal is not damaged by the light power. It is known that 
the crystal length does not affect the upper limit value of 
the wavelength conversion efficiency factor γ; this is 
changed by only alteration of the most suitable condition for 
gathering light (D. Eimerl, et al.: "Optical, mechanical, 
and thermal properties of barium borate", Journal of Applied 
Physics, 62
