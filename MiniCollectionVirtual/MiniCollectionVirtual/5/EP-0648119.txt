<DESCRIPTION>
 5'-INDOLLNYL OXAZOLIDINONES USEFUL AGAINST MYCOBACTERIUM TUBERCULOSISBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the Invention The invention is the use of two 5'-indolinyl oxazolidionones (I) to treat tuberculosis(TB) caused by M . tuberculosis.2. Description of the Related ArtTuberculosis (TB) is a well known disease which is caused by M. tuberculosis.At present various agents are used to treat those infected with TB. The most common of these pharmaceutical agents include isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, p-aminosalicylic acid, pyrazinamide, streptomycin, capreomycin, cycloserine, ethionamide and kanamycin and aminoglycosides antibiotics and mixtures thereof.Since the introduction of antibiotics and the better health care practices in the 1950's, the incidence of TB had declined an average of six percent per year until 1985. Since then there has been a 16 percent per year increase in new TB cases. This increased incidence of TB has been accompanied by outbreaks of multi-drug resistant strains of M. tuberculosis. BecauseTB has never declined in incidence in the developing and underdeveloped countries and the additional cases related to the increase in AIDS, the World Health Organization recently established a Working Group to develop new antibiotics to treat TB which are urgently needed. While there are pharmaceutical agents presently available to treat those infected withTB, it is highly desirable to have a better agent because of the development of M. tuberculosis strains resistant to current therapeutics.US Patent 4,128,654 discloses 5-halomethylphenyl-2-oxazolidinones which are useful in controlling fungal and bacterial diseases of plants. US Patent 4,250,318 discloses 3-substituted phenyl-5-hydroxymethyloxazolidinones having anti depressive utility.US Reissue Patent 29,607 discloses 3-substituted phenyl-5-hydroxymethyloxazolidinones having antidepressive, tranquilizing and sedative utility.US Patent 4,340,606 discloses 3-(p-alkylsulfonyl)phenyl-5-(hydroxymethyl or acyloxymethyl)oxazolidinones having antibacterial activity in mammals.Belgium Patent 892,270 discloses 3-(arylalkyl, arylalkenyl or arylacetylenic substituted)phenyl)-5-(aminomethyl)oxazolidinones which are inhibitors of monoamine oxidase.US Patent 4,461,773 discloses 3-substituted phenyl-5-hydroxymethyloxazolidinones which have antibacterial activity. European Patent Publications 127,902 and 184,170 disclose 3-substituted phenyl-5- amidomethyloxazolidinones which have antibacterial utility.
