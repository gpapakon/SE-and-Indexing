<ABSTRACT>
A termination arrangement for a coaxial cable comprises a dimensionally heat-recoverable sleeve that encloses a connecting element for the screen of the cable and a quantity of solder for forming a permanent electrical connection between the connecting element and the cable screen. The connecting element has a generally cylindrical portion whose diameter is capable of changing and which is held in a state of larger diameter by the solder and/or the sleeve, the element changing to a smaller diameter state when the sleeve is recovered. In use, the arrangement is positioned over a coaxial cable which has been prepared so as to expose an appropriate length of the central conductor, dielectric and screen. When the sleeve is recovered, the solder fuses and the connecting element contracts around the screen.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Coaxial Cable Termination ArrangementThis invention relates to the formation of electrical connections to coaxial cables and especially to the termination of the screens of such cables.In modern communication systems it is important that connections to coaxial cables, for example connections between cables employing a coaxial connection, connections to printed circuit boards and the like, are impedance matched in order to minimize the amplitude of signal reflections. Clearly also the connections should be made with a low installed cost. At present coaxial cables are usually terminated at coaxial connectors in one of three ways: by crimping, by clamping or by means of solder. The solder arrangements generally exhibit the best electrical performance but are normally employed only for prototype assembly in view of their cost, whereas the crimp type of termination exhibits relatively poor electrical characteristics but is susceptible to relatively high volume production. In addition, it is often not possible to make crimp replacement terminations in the field. Cable clamp arrangements, on the other hand, can be employed in the field but are only susceptible to low volume production.According to the present invention, there is provided a termination arrangement for a coaxial cable, which comprises a dimensionally heat-recoverable sleeve that encloses a connecting element for the screen of the cable and a quantity of solder for forming a permanent electrical connection between the connecting element and the cable screen, the connecting element having a generally cylindrical 

portion whose diameter is capable of changing and which is held in a state of larger diameter by the solder and/or the sleeve, the element changing to a smaller diameter state when the sleeve is recovered.In order to terminate the screen of a coaxial cable, the cable jacket, screen and dielectric layer are each cut back in order to expose an appropriate length of the central conductor, dielectric and screen, the arrangement is positioned over the cable so that the exposed length of the cable screen is located within the generally cylindrical portion of the connecting element, and the assembly is briefly heated, for example by means of an infrared lamp or a hot-air gun, in order to cause the sleeve to recover, the solder to fuse and the connecting element to contract around the cable screen. The arrangement according to the invention has the advantage that it is relatively simple in construction, thereby allowing high volume production,

Clai s:
1. A termination arrangement for a coaxial cable, which comprises a dimensionally heat-recoverable sleeve that encloses a connecting element for the screen of the cable and a quantity of solder for forming a permanent electrical connection between the connecting element and the cable screen, the connecting element having a generally cylindrical portion whose diameter is capable of changing and which is held in a state of larger diameter by the solder and/or the sleeve, the element changing to a smaller diameter state when the sleeve is recovered.
2. An arrangement as claimed in claim 1, wherein the connecting element is biassed to a state of smaller diameter and is held in its state of larger diameter by the solder and/or the sleeve.
3. An arrangement as claimed in claim 1, wherein the connecting element is forced into its state of smaller diameter by recovery of the sleeve.
4. An arrangement as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein the connecting element has one or more axial slits that allow its diameter to change.
5. An arrangement as claimed in claim 4, wherein a portion of the solder and/or the wall of the sleeve is located within part of the slit or slits.
6. An arrangement as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5, wherein the connecting element has been formed in one piece.
7. An arrangement as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein the connecting element is in the form of a helicoidal spring.
8. An array of termination arrangements as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 7, in which the connecting elements of the termination 


arrangements have been formed on a strip of metal and are individually removable from the strip.
9. A connector for a coaxial cable, which comprises a male or female contact for the central conductor of the cable, a termination arrangement as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 7 for terminating the screen of the cable and a connecting piece which holds the termination arrangement and the central conductor contact, the connecting piece providing screen continuity for the cable.
