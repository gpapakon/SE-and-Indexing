<ABSTRACT>
Absorption properties of an optically active medium can be changed 
drastically by a Fabry-Perot microcavity. Optically active medium of the cavity 

includes a host material which is not optically active and at least one rare earth ion 
which provides optical activity to the medium. The Fabry-Perot cavity is designed 

to be resonant with excitation wavelength of an absorption band of the host material. 
The excitation is provided by a source of radiation positioned such that the radiation 

impinges on the cavity at an angle within a range of from zero to less than 90 
degrees from the normal to the top surface of the cavity. In one embodiment Er-implanted 

SiO₂ is used as the optically active medium. SiO₂:Er has an absorption 
band at 980 nm and an emission band at 1.55 µm due to 4f intra-atomic transitions of 

Er³⁺ ions. The Fabry-Pérot cavity is designed to be resonant with the 980 nm 
absorption band of SiO₂:Er. The efficiency of the cavity structure is much higher as 

compared to a no-cavity structure, while the spectral features of the active SiO₂:Er 
emission are unaltered. The structure can be used for optically pumped 

semiconductor devices, such as optical amplifiers or lasers, which could be operated 
with a higher overall efficiency.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to optical devices having a rare earth element-doped 
active region within a Fabry-Perot cavity, and especially to devices having an 
erbium-doped active region. The incorporation of rare earth ions of lanthanide series of elements 
with numbers ranging from 57 to 71 of the Mendeleev's periodic system in glasses 
has led to the development of optical fiber lasers and amplifiers. Current interest is 
directed towards erbium-doped fibers for the fabrication of non-planar light-emitting 
devices, such as optical fiber lasers and amplifiers emitting at 1.53-1.55 µm signal 
wavelength. Although such non-planar light-emitting devices can advantageously be 
used in a variety of communications systems, there are many potential applications 
for light-emitting devices for which non-planar devices are not readily or 
conveniently adapted. For instance, it would be desirable to integrate planar devices 
emitting at 1.53-1.55 µm signal wavelength with electronic and opto-electronic 
devices or structures. Such planar devices are desirable replacements for the non-planar 
devices, due to their compact nature and increased mechanical stability, and 
are likely to find applications in lightwave communications systems. Recently it was shown that a planar optical device with a Fabry-Perot 
cavity may be formed by two reflectors and an active layer which is doped with a 
rare earth element selected from lanthanide series elements with numbers 57 through 
71. See US-A-5249195 which corresponds to the preamble of claim 1. 
The fundamental mode of the cavity is in resonance with 
the emission wavelength of the selected rare earth element. In such a device, the 
operating wavelength fully depends on the wavelength of emission from an 
implanted ion. In a specific example of the Feldman et al. invention, a Fabry-Perot 
microcavity, grown on a Si substrate, consists of two Si/SiO2 distributed Bragg 
reflectors (DBRs) and an Er-doped SiO2 active region. Er is incorporated into the 
center of the SiO2 layer of the cavity as optically active Er atoms in SiO2. The 
fundamental mode of the cavity is in resonance with the 1.55 µm emission of a 4f 
electronic transition of Er3+ atoms in SiO2. This leads to excellent emission 
characteristics, including the spontaneous emission intensity, spectral finesse and 
emission lifetime, as compared to a no cavity structure, e.g., to a structure having 
only a bottom reflector and a rare-earth doped active layer.  
 It is desirable to further improve luminescence
