<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to the recovery of 
3,4-epoxy-1-butene from an oxidation effluent comprising 
3,4-epoxy-1-butene, 1,3-butadiene, an inert gas and 
oxygen produced by the selective oxidation of 1,3-butadiene. 
More specifically, one embodiment of the present 
invention pertains to a process wherein the aforesaid 
oxidation effluent is intimately contacted with liquid 
1,3-butadiene in an absorption zone to obtain a solution 
of 3,4-epoxy-1-butene in 1,3-butadiene. Another 
embodiment of the invention pertains to the utilization 
of the 3,4-epoxy-1-butene recovery process as a means 
for accurately regulating the amount of 1,3-butadiene in 
the gas fed to an oxidation zone wherein 1,3-butadiene 
is selectively oxidized to 3,4-epoxy-1-butene. U.S. Patents 4,897,498 and 4,950,773 disclose 
processes for the manufacture of 3,4-epoxy-1-butene 
(referred to herein as EpB) by the selective epoxidation 
of 1,3-butadiene (referred to herein as butadiene) 
wherein butadiene is contacted with an oxygen-containing 
gas in the presence of certain silver catalysts. To 
achieve high yields of EpB (based on the butadiene 
consumed), especially when operating on a commercial 
scale, it is necessary to maintain the conversion of the 
butadiene at relatively low levels, e.g., from 2 to 20 
mole percent based on the butadiene fed to the epoxidation 
zone. The epoxidation effluent thus contains 
significant amounts of butadiene which must be recovered 
and recycled to the epoxidation zone. Obtaining a high 
yield of EpB also requires the presence of an inert gas 
diluent in the gas feed to the epoxidation zone. For 
example, an inert gas such as methane, nitrogen, helium  
 
or the like typically constitutes from 50 to 80 mole 
percent of the gas feed to the epoxidation zone. EpB is a very reactive compound which can be used 
to manufacture a variety of chemicals. Due to its 
reactivity, the recovery of EpB from epoxidation 
effluents must be performed under mild conditions to 
avoid the conversion of EpB to other undesired compounds 
such as butenediols and oligomers. It is possible to 
recover EpB directly from the epoxidation effluent by 
compressing the gaseous effluent to pressures 
sufficiently high to liquify the EpB. However, the 
compression of the effluent would require the use of a 
series of compressors and heat exchangers to remove the 
heat of compression and maintain the EpB at a 
temperature which would minimize by-product formation. The recovery of gaseous products by absorption 
techniques wherein a
