apparatus having a semiconductor laser structure, and 

serving as an amplifier for imparting a gain to input 
light from outside the apparatus. In the optical amplifying 

apparatus, a second semiconductor layer (14) is formed on at 
least a first semiconductor layer (1). The lattice constant 

of the second semiconductor layer is less than the

semiconductor layers, and serves as a well layer of an 
active layer having a quantum well structure (4). A third 

semiconductor layer (13a,13b) is also formed on at least the first 
semiconductor layer. The lattice constant of the third 

semiconductor layer is less than the lattice constant of 
the first semiconductor layer. The third semiconductor 

layer also undergoes a biaxial tensile stress due to

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polarization 
insensitive semiconductor optical amplifier or 
amplifying apparatus and an optical communication 
system or network using this optical amplifier. Generally, a semiconductor optical amplifier or 
an amplifying apparatus comprises a semiconductor laser structure 
including an active layer and a cladding layer, and amplifies 
an input light by means of a bias current, below a threshold, 
injected into the laser structure. In the optical communication 
field, the optical amplifier has been developed as a device 
for compensating for an optical loss that occurs in 
optical fibers or at connections between optical fibers. However, there has been the problem of a polarization 
dependency of the optical amplification factor (i.e. the optical 
amplification factor differs depending on the different 
polarization modes of an input light) when a semiconductor 
optical amplifier is used in optical fiber communication 
systems. Generally, the state of polarization of an output 
light, which is transmitted through the optical fiber, is 
unstable, so the level of an output light from the  
 
optical amplifier will not be stable when such light 
from the optical fiber is input into such an amplifier 
having the above-discussed polarization dependency. 
Further, the fluctuation of such output burdens a light 
receiving system regarding its dynamic range and 
the like. This is a vital drawback which limits the 
scale of the communication system. Therefore, various conventional methods of 
fabricating a polarization insensitive optical amplifier 
have been performed. Among them, a method of using a 
strain quantum well structure is proposed as a method 
for solving the polarization dependency of optical 
gain in the active layer. The strain quantum well 
structure is used for both controlling the oscillation 
wavelength and reducing an oscillation threshold gain 
in the field of semiconductor lasers, and thus 
this structure is a remarkably useful technique. Generally, in order to utilize a strain quantum 
well structure as a polarization insensitive optical 
amplifier, the gain for TM mode light is equalized with or 
made larger than that for TE light. More in particular, 
the degeneracy in a valence band is solved by the 
effect of strain, and hence band structures of heavy and 
light holes are respectively shifted. Thus, the energy gap 
between the ground level of electrons in the conduction band 
and the level of heavy holes in the valence band is 
approximately made
