<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to packages of melt processable products and 
more particularly to such packages which use films as packaging 
containers which are consumable with the melt processable products 
retained therein. The packaging and shipment of products always involves the 
question - what happens to the packaging materials? Today, 
packaging materials can be either incinerated, land-filled, or 
recycled. As environmental legislation becomes more strict, the 
incineration or land-filling of packaging materials will no longer be 
feasible. Polymeric products and elastomers are conveniently packaged in 25 
kg bags which, after the contents are removed, are then typically 
incinerated or sent to a land-fill. Thus, there is a need for heavy 
duty bags for such products whose disposal does not involve 
environmental problems. The bag waste-disposal problems for such 
products have been solved by the present invention by using a bag 
which is incorporated into a final product along with the contents of 
the bag. According to the present invention there is provided a consumable 
package capable of being used in a melt-processing operation which  
 
comprises: a container and a melt-processable product retained 
therein, said container comprising a film of an 
ethylene copolymer having a melting point lower than the 
temperature of the melt-processing operation and a stiffness 
measured by ASTM D882 of greater than 400 megapascals, 
and said ethylene copolymer comprises 55-90% by weight of 
ethylene and up to 45% by weight of an unsaturated monocarboxylic 
acid having 3-8 carbon atoms which is neutralized 
from 0-40% by at least one metal ion selected from 
lithium, sodium, magnesium and zinc. Products packaged according to the present invention are those 
which will be used in a melt processing operation. A melt 
processing operation is one where various materials are heated and 
mixed together. Heating is typically above the softening point of the 
main meltable material so that it flows while being mixed. Mixing is 
typically carried out in blenders, milling or mixing rolls, calenders 
and extruders. Melt processable products typically are polymers, elastomers and 
additives for these products such as pigments and fillers. For 
example, NEOPRENE® elastomer is heated to 85-95°C, kneaded at this 
temperature optionally with other additives, calendered or pressed 
and cured. Hot melt adhesives are prepared from ethylene/vinyl 
acetate copolymers; these copolymers can be packaged according to 
the invention
