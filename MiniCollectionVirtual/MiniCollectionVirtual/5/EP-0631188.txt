<ABSTRACT>
Photoacid generators advantageous for use in applications such as 
photoacid generators used in chemically amplified resists are disclosed. These 

compounds are based on an ortho nitro benzyl configuration employing an α 
substituent having high bulk, steric characteristics, and electron withdrawing ability. 

The enhanced efficacy is particularly found in compounds both having a suitable α 
substituent and a second ortho substituent with large electron withdrawing and steric 

effects.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to lithographic processes, and, in particular, to 
lithographic processes involving device fabrication. Lithographic processes are typically employed in the manufacture of 
devices such as semiconductor devices. Among the lithographic processes that are 
available, photolithography is often utilized. Photolithographic processes have the 
advantage of being suitable for a blanket exposure technique. That is, a material that 
is sensitive to the exposing light is coated onto a substrate, e.g., a silicon wafer, that 
is being processed to form a plurality of devices. The coating material, i.e., the 
resist, is then subjected to light that has been passed through a mask material so that 
the light reaching the resist produces an image that, after development, yields a 
desired pattern that is to be transferred into the underlying substrate. Since the 
exposure occurs simultaneously over an entire device or a number of devices being 
processed on a substrate, e.g., a silicon substrate, the procedure is considered a 
blanket exposure. A blanket exposure procedure is advantageous because it is relatively 
fast compared to other methods such as the raster scan technique usually employed 
when the energy used to expose the resist is a beam of electrons. However, 
generally, resolution obtainable through a blanket exposure with ultraviolet or 
visible light is somewhat poorer than that achieved with methods such as electron 
lithography. Improved resolution with a blanket exposure is achievable by using deep 
ultraviolet light. One such approach involves a photoresist sensitive to deep 
ultraviolet radiation containing a compound that produces an acid moiety upon 
irradiation with such radiation together with a polymer that reacts with the generated 
acid. Typical acid generator/acid sensitive polymer combinations include an onium 
salt as the photosensitive acid generator and a polymer such as poly(p-t-butoxycarbonyloxystyrene) 
as the polymer having a reactive substituent. The use of an inorganic salt such as the onium salt as the acid generator 
is not entirely desirable. There is a possibility of contamination of the device being 
processed by inorganic ionic species from the salt Additionally, ionic acid 
generators also have the tendency to phase separate from the acid sensitive resin. 
Therefore, organic acid generators having reasonable sensitivity to deep ultraviolet  
 
light for use in a photoresist are quite desirable. An organic photoacid generator based on ortho nitrobenzyl
