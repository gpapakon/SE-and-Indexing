<ABSTRACT>
The hydrostatic elastic system for suspensions of vehicles 
has a high flexibility at interemediate loads acting on the 

vehicle and a low flexibility at low and high loads. The 
system comprises a telescopic upright (1) interposed between 

body of the vehicle and a wheel, constituted by a cylinder (2) 
and by a plunging rod (3), and at least two hydropneumatic 

accumulators (22, 30) forming hydropneumatic springs. With 
said rod (3) there are associated distributor means (12, 13, 

14, 15, 25) capable of placing a chamber (10) of the cylinder 
(2) in communication with the two accumulators (22, 30) for a 

given intermediate portion of the stroke of the rod (3) and 
capable of placing the chamber (10) in communication with one 

only of said accumulators (22) for given end portions of the 
stroke of the rod (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hydrostatic elastic 
system having variable flexibility for suspensions of road or 
rail vehicles. As is known the flexibility of an elastic system constituted 
by a spring is the ratio between deformation (set) and applied 
load. Elastic systems having variable flexibility for suspensions 
of vehicles can be constituted by springs of the mechanical 
type or of the pneumatic type. Springs of the mechanical type can be variable-pitch helical 
springs having decreasing flexibility as the load increases due 
to the fact that the turns of the spring are progressively 
deactivated by the reciprocal contact. These are springs whose overall strokes, from minimum to 
maximum loads, are very long and thus have a considerable size. 
In addition, the law governing the variation of the flexibility 
is not always the best for the different conditions of a 
vehicle's load. Springs of the pneumatic type are constituted by a flexible 
casing holding a cylindrical casing containing an inert gas, or 
air, under pressure and have low flexibility at low and high 
loads and a high flexibility at intermediate loads. These springs have a very favourable law of the variation of 
the flexibility, but these again have a considerable size, due 
to the fact that the flexible casing is not in a position of 
withstanding high gas pressures.  The object of the present invention is an elastic system 
with variable flexibility for suspensions of road or rail 
vehicles, that allows the optimization of the law of variation 
of the flexibility and has an acceptable size in the area of 
the body's suspension on the wheel. According to the invention, such object is attained with a 
hydrostatic elastic system for suspensions of vehicles provided 
with a body and with wheels, characterized in that it comprises 
a telescopic upright interposed between the body of the vehicle 
and a wheel, constituted by a cylinder and by a plunging rod 
that holds a disc and is slidable in a chamber of said cylinder 
for a given stroke, and at least two hydropneumatic 
accumulators, forming hydropneumatic springs, operationally 
connected to said cylinder, there being associated with said 
rod distributor means capable of placing said chamber in 
communication with said two accumulators for a given 
intermediate portion of the stroke of the rod and capable of 
placing said chamber in communication with one only of said 
accumulators for given end portions of the stroke of the rod, 
so that said elastic system exhibits a high

Hydrostatic elastic system for suspensions of vehicles 
provided with a body and with wheels, characterized in that it 

comprises a telescopic upright (1) interposed between the body 
of the vehicle and a wheel, constituted by a cylinder (2) and 

by a plunging rod (3) that holds a disc (4) and is slidable in 
a chamber (10) of said cylinder (2) for a given stroke, and at 

least two hydropneumatic accumulators (22, 30), forming 
hydropneumatic springs, operationally connected to said 

cylinder (2), there being associated with said rod (3) 
distributor means (12, 13, 14, 15, 25) capable of placing said 

chamber (10) in communication with said two accumulators (22, 
30) for a given intermediate portion of the stroke of the rod 

(3) and capable of placing said chamber (10) in communication 
with one only of said accumulators (22) for given end 

portions of the stroke of the rod (3), so that said elastic 
system exhibits a high flexibility at intermediate loads acting 

on the vehicle and a low flexibility at low and high loads. 
Elastic system according to claim 1, characterized in 
that said rod (3) is sealingly slidable in a seat (6) of said 

cylinder (2) and is provided with an internal cavity (12), with 
radial holes (13, 14) located at the extremities of the cavity 

(12), and with an annular groove (15), communicating with 
chamber (10) of said cylinder (2), and said cylinder (2) is 

provided with a hole (18), that places said chamber (10) in 
communication with one (22) of said hydropneumatic accumulators 

through calibrated ports (29) and two check valves (21) 
operating in the opposite direction, said cylinder (2) being 

also provided with a further hole (26) communicating with an 
annular groove (25) and with the other (30) of said 

 
hydropneumatic accumulators through further calibrated ports 

(29) and two further check valves (21), operating in the 
opposite direction, said groove (25) and hole (26) placing the 

groove (15) of the rod (3) in communication with said 
accumulator (30), when the rod (3) assumes given positions 

intermediate between the outer ends of its stroke. 
Elastic system according to claim 1, characterized in 
that each of said accumulators (22, 30) has a casing (31) 

containing a liner (32) in which there slides a piston (33) 
provided with a seal ring (34), that separates a chamber (36) 

containing oil, from a chamber (37) containing an inert gas 
under pressure, on said rod (3) there acting a spring (38), 

capable of exerting on the oil in said chamber (36) a slightly 
higher pressure than that of the gas in said chamber (37), so 

as to ensure the oil seal of said ring (34). 
Elastic system according to claim 3, characterized in 
that between said liner (32) and casing (31) of each 

accumulator (22, 30) there is a cavity (39) filled with gas

it from undergoing deformations. 
Elastic system according to claim 2, characterized in

frustum-shaped valves (70), provided with threaded stems (71) 
screwed into threaded holes (72) of a body (62) contained in a 

cover (28) flanged to the casing (31) of one of said 
accumulators (22; 30), each stem (71) being caused to rotate by 

a pivot (73) rotatably supported in a hole (75) of the cover 
(28) by means of a bar (76) provided with radial pawls (77), 

two of which engage in longitudinal grooves (78) of a stem 
(71), while two other pawls (77) are caused to rotate by teeth 

 
(79) integral with said pivot (73) and are held axially in an 

annular groove (80) of a plate (63) interposed between said 
body (62) and said cover (28), so that, when the pivots (73) 

are made to rotate, the valves (70) are axially displaced with 
respect to said ports (29) and there is an increase or a 

decrease in their passage cross-section, obtaining an 
adjustment of the dampening effect of the suspension due to the 

passage of oil.
