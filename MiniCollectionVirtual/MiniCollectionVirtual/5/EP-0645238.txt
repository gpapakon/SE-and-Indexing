<ABSTRACT>
In an apparatus for stacking bags made by separation welding of tubular plastic film or semi-tubular plastic film, these are impaled, to form stacks, on a holding plate which carries stacking pins or stacking needles which project upwards and is arranged in a stacking station, by a transfer device which consists of a so-called "Wicketer" having transport arms which are arranged like a star and in pairs, rotate about a horizontal axis and are fastened on a shaft. A conveyor, consisting of an endless belt, conveys the separation-welded bags from a transverse welding and separating station into the region of the transport arms. In order to be able to increase the number of the transport arms to lengthen the cooling time, at at least equal loading, the conveyor path of the conveyor between the transverse welding and separating station and the enveloping cylinder of the transport arms is equal to one bag length or greater than one bag length.
