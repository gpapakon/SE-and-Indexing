<ABSTRACT>
A recliner seat (7) includes a seat frame 
(8), a back rest frame (4) pivotably mounted with 

respect to the seat frame (8), an adjuster (48) for 
adjusting the inclination of the back rest frame (4) 

with respect to the seat frame (8), a strut (12) 
pivotably mounted to the back rest frame (4) at a 

first fixed pivotal axis and having a lost motion 
pivotal attachment (26) with the seat frame (8), the 

strut (12) having on an end adjacent to the seat frame 
(8) a pin (26) which can move with respect to the seat 

frame (8). The seat frame (8) includes a latch (32) 
and a pendulum (42) to actuate the latch (32). When 

the seat accelerates forwardly beyond a predetermined 
acceleration level, the pendulum (42) causes the latch 

(32) to pivot upwardly to engage the pin (26), causing 
the strut (12) to have a fixed pivotal axis with the 

seat frame (8) and thereby to limit rearward 
inclination of the back rest frame (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a recliner 
seat for a vehicle and to a method of limiting 
inclination of a back rest of a recliner seat. Most of the design restraints associated 
with vehicle seating are primarily concerned with 
preventing the vehicle seat from moving forward in a 
frontal impact crash. However, sometimes it is 
desirable to prevent the back rests of the front seats 
from moving rearwardly. At present, the main factor 
which prevents rearward movement of the back rest is 
the structural integrity of the seat. Preventing 
possible rearward motion of a seat is harder to obtain 
when utilising a reclining seat, in which seat back 
rest can be reclined rearwardly. US-A-5163735 
describes a recliner seat in accordance with the 
preamble of claim 1. The present invention seeks to provide an 
improved recliner seat and method of limiting the 
inclination of the back rest of a recliner seat. A recliner seat in accordance with the 
present invention is characterised over US-A-5163735 
by the features specified in the characterising 
portion of claim 1. A preferred embodiment includes a vehicle 
seat with an auxiliary strut having a fixed pivotal 
connection with either the back rest member or the 
seat member and a lost motion pivotal connection with 
the other member. In situations where the vehicle 
encounters a rear impact, the lost motion pivotal 
attachment is latched, thereby causing both ends of 
the strut to have fixed pivotal axes with the back 
rest member and the seat member, thereby hindering any 
further rearward motion of the back rest member.  
 
However, in normal operation, the strut allows 
movement of the back rest rearwardly with respect to 
the seat member with virtually no interference. An embodiment of the present invention is 
described below, by way of example only, with 
reference to the accompanying drawings, in which: 
Figure 1 is a perspective view of a 
preferred embodiment of recliner seat; Figure 2 is an enlarged view of the seat 
shown in Figure 1 with a portion of the seat omitted 
for clarity of illustration; and Figure 3 is a perspective view of an 
alternative embodiment of strut for use in the seat of 
Figure 1. Referring to Figures 1, 2 and 3, a preferred 
embodiment of seat 7 includes a back rest member 2 
having a generally inverted U-shaped back rest frame 
4. The back rest frame 4 is pivotably connected to a 
frame 8 of a seat member 6 at a fixed pivotal axis by 
pins 10. In order to adjust the inclination of the 
back rest frame 4 with respect to

<CLAIMS>
A recliner seat for a vehicle comprising 
a seat frame member (8); a back rest frame member (4) 

pivotably mounted with respect to the seat frame 
member; adjusting means (48) operative to adjust the 

inclination of the back rest frame member with respect 
to the seat frame member; a strut (12) pivotably 

mounted to one of the seat and back rest frame members 
at a fixed pivotal axis; and latch actuation means 

(42); characterised in that the strut (12) includes 
means (26) of lost motion pivotal attachment with the 

other frame member; and in that the latch actuation 
means (42) is operative to cause latch means (32) to 

prevent translational movement of the pivotal 

attachment of the strut with the other of the seat and 
back rest frame members so as to cause the strut to 

tend to limit rearward inclination of the back rest 
frame member when acceleration of the seat in a 

forward direction relative to the seat exceeds a 
predetermined acceleration level.  

 
A recliner seat according to claim 1, 
wherein the lost motion pivotal attachment means 

includes a pin (26) fixed to the strut and engageable 
to the latch means on actuation of the latch means. 
A recliner seat according to claim 2, 
comprising guide means (30) on the other of the seat 

and back rest frame members for guiding movement of 
the pin. 
A recliner seat according to claim 2 or 
3, wherein the latch means is movable towards the pin 

so as to engage the pin to prevent or limit movement 
of the pin and thereby of the strut when the latch 

means is actuated by the latch actuation means. 
A recliner seat according to any 
preceding claim, wherein the latch actuation means 

includes a pendulum (42) movable on acceleration of  
 

the seat beyond the predetermined acceleration level 
so as to actuate the latch means. 
A recliner seat according to any 
preceding claim, wherein the fixed pivotal axis to 

which the strut is mounted is on the back rest frame. 
A recliner seat according to any 
preceding claim, wherein the strut is formed of one 

member. 
A recliner seat according to any one of 
claims 1 to 6, wherein the strut is formed from two 

members (14,16) pivotably connected to one another. 
A recliner seat according to claim 8, 
wherein the strut includes a spring (22) operative to 

bias the two members to an angle relative to one 
another and thereby the strut into a bent position.
