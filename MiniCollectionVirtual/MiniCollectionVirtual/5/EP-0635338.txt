Apparatus (10) for receiving and holding tools,
instruments, Writing implements or similar articles,

having a gap (21), which is defined by a backing
surface (15) and an abutment surface (11a) extending

substantially surface-parallel thereto, resilient
projections projecting freely across the gap width

(19) from at least one of the two surfaces (15) and
holding each article in a substantially friction-locked

manner in the gap, the backing surface (15) and
the abutment surface (11a or 15) being fastened in a

spatially fixed manner relative to one another and at
least one end region of the gap forming an insertion

opening and/or through-opening (16; 17) for the
article, 
characterized in
 that the resilient
projections are formed by bristle-like elements (14),

which are disposed in tufts or groups of tufts on at
least one of the two surfaces (11a or 15).
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in that
the bristle-like elements (14) are disposed on both

surfaces (11a, 15) and directed towards one another.
Apparatus according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in
that the bristle-like elements (14) are fastened

substantially cohesively to the backing surface (15).
Apparatus according to claim 3, characterized in that
the backing surface (15) comprises a web-like plastic

material.
Apparatus according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized by at least one holder (12) for the

backing surface (15), the holder being fastened to a
surface (11a), such as a wall, tool bag partition wall 

or the like, which forms or provides the abutment
surface.
Apparatus according to claim 5, characterized in that
the holder (12) substantially has the shape of a tube

with a rectangular cross section and on at least one
of its large inner surfaces at least one strip-like

web portion is fastened and the tube ends form an
insertion cross section and/or through-cross section

(16, 17) for the article.
Apparatus according to claim 5, characterized in that
the holder (12) substantially has the shape of a

stirrup and is fastened by its open U-end against a
wall (11) forming the abutment surface (11a).
Apparatus according to one of claims 5 to 7,
characterized in that the holder (12) is provided with

a base part (12c) for supporting the article.
Apparatus according to claim 1 and/or 2 or one of the
successive claims, characterized in that the webs (14,

15) are formed by narrow strips and at least two webs
(14, 15) are disposed spaced apart from one another

(Fig. 3).
Apparatus according to claim 9, characterized in that
the spacing apart of the webs (14, 15) varies, in

particular continuously decreases or increases, from
one narrow end to the other.
Apparatus according to claim 1 and/or 2 or one of the
successive claims, characterized in that the backing

surface (15) having the bristle-like elements (14)
comprises a portion of a commercially available floor

covering, in particular in the manner of artificial
turf.
