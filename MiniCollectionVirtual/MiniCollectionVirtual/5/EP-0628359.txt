<ABSTRACT>
A method of manufacturing hot rolled silicon steel sheets, which consists of the steps of heating a silicon 
steel slab at a high temperature so as to roughly hot roll the same, and thereafter subjecting the resultant product to 

finishing hot rolling, wherein the rolling on a first stand, which is conducted during the finishing hot rolling, is done 
under the conditions satisfying the following expression: 


(T
F1
-T
F0
)/{(T
F1
-t
F2
)/2}≦10+t
F1
/10(°C/mm) 
 
, wherein t
F1
(mm) 
represents the thickness of a steel sheet which is on the inlet side of the stand, t
F2
(mm) the thickness of a steel sheet 
which is on the outlet side of the stand, T
F0
(°C) the surface temperature of the sheet at the roll-in time, and T
F1
 the 
temperature of the portion, which has a depth of (t
F1
-t
F2
)/2(mm) measured from the outer surface thereof, of the sheet 
at the roll-in time. This enables the prevention of flaws and cracks on and in a steel sheet during the hot rolling of 

the same, and the obtainment of a hot-rolled silicon steel sheet of excellent surface properties.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of producing
silicon steel hot rolled sheets, and more particularly
to a method of producing silicon steel hot rolled sheets
having excellent surface properties.Grain-oriented magnetic steel sheets are used as
a material for iron core in transformers and other
electrical machinery and apparatus and required to have
a high magnetic flux density and a low iron loss. These
magnetic properties are attained by providing secondary
recrystallized structure with a texture having {110}
face in parallel to a rolling face and 〈001〉 axis along
a rolling direction or having so-called Goss orientation
as a main direction.For this purpose, various components including
silicon are added to the grain-oriented magnetic silicon
steel sheet. However, it is known that the workability
lowers and particularly surface cracks and surface 
defects are apt to be considerably produced through hot
rolling. If the degree of the surface defects is
conspicuous, not only the appearance is poor, but also
the degradation of the properties such as lowering of
lamination factor, lowering of interlaminar insulation
property and the like is caused. Therefore, it is an
important matter how to prevent such surface cracks and
surface defects in view of the production step.As a method of decreasing cracks at the hot
rolling step for the grain-oriented silicon steel sheet,
there have hitherto been proposed a method of
controlling intergranular oxidation by the addition of
Mo or the like as described in JP-A-61-9521, a method of
decreasing cracks by refining the structure through
recrystallization as described in JP-A-2-182832, JP-A-3-115526
and JP-A-62-149815, and the like. However, these
methods are not involved in drastic settlements.Furthermore, JP-A-63-295044 proposes a method of
controlling generation of slag by setting an existing
time in a high-temperature furnace during the heating of
slab to a certain upper limit, which brings about the
restriction of operation to lower the productivity.As mentioned above, the conventional techniques
for preventing cracks of silicon steel sheet in the hot
rolling do not yet provide satisfactory results. It is an object of the invention to provide a
method capable of producing silicon steel hot rolled
sheets having good surface properties while effectively
preventing generation of surface cracks from a new
viewpoint that stress condition in the rolling deformation
is improved to prevent generation of surface cracks
by controlling a temperature distribution in the
thicknes
