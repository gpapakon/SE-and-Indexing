<ABSTRACT>
A commutator intended to be forcibly fitted onto an alternater shaft, especially for a motor vehicle, is produced by the overmoulding of insulating material on conducting elements and comprises a generally cylindrical body (10a, 10b, 20, 22) which includes, on its outer surface, two slip rings (10a, 10b) connected to two elements (14a, 14b) for connection with the ends of wires (FB) of a winding, the body including a bore (24) for the said shaft and an extension piece (28) made of insulating material beyond one of the two rings, on one side where the fitting force has to be exerted. According to the invention, at least one notch (30, 30', 30'') is formed in the said extension piece, through its entire axial thickness, and leaves visible one edge of the adjacent ring (10b), in such a way that the fitting force can be exerted directly on the said ring through the said notch.

Commutator designed to be forcibly fitted on an alternator 
shaft, notably for a motor vehicle, of the type produced by 

moulding insulating material onto electrically conductive 
elements, and comprising a generally cylindrical body (10a, 10b, 

20, 22) having on its external surface two collector rings (10a, 
10b) connected to two elements (14a, 14b) for connection with the 

ends of wires (FB) of a coil, the body having a bore (24) for the 
said shaft and an extension made of insulating material (28) 

beyond one of the two rings, on a side where a fitting force is 
to be exerted, characterised in that at least one notch (30, 30', 

30") is formed in the said extension, in its entire axial 
thickness, and reveals an edge of the adjacent ring (10b), so 

that the fitting force can be exerted directly on the said ring 
through the said notch. 
Commutator according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
provision is made for at least two notches (30, 30', 30") formed 

in the entire axial thickness of the extension (28), and in that 
these notches are disposed with asymmetry of revolution over 

180°, so as to take the place of locators for the angular 
positioning of the commutator (1) in one out of two possible 

positions, themselves offset by 180° with respect to one another. 
Commutator according to Claim 2, characterised in that three 
notches (30, 30', 30"
) are provided, spaced apart angularly by 
120°. 
Commutator according to Claim 3, characterised in that two 
diametrically opposed flutes (26, 26') are formed in the said 

bore (24) and in that one (30) of the notches is angularly 
aligned with one (26) of the said flutes. 
Commutator according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that one or each notch (30, 30', 30") is formed 

in the entire radial width of the extension.  
 
Alternator (A) notably for a motor vehicle, characterised in 
that it has, on a projecting shaft (AR) a commutator (1) 

according to one of the preceding claims.
