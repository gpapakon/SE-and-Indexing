<ABSTRACT>
A wheel chair ramp (1) comprises a plurality of leaves (2, 3, 4) extending in the direction of intended use of the ramp. The leaves are joined together by flexible hinges (5) so that the leaves may be folded to a stalked condition. The flexible hinges are formed by fabric straps attached to the sides of the leaves (6, 7) and passing between adjacent leaves.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved wheel chair ramp, more particularly to a 
ramp which is easily collapsible, light and easily handled. Although many buildings and civil works incorporate in their construction 
ramps for use by the occupants of wheel chairs, there are many buildings 
areas, gutters, steps, drains and the like which can impede or prevent the 
passage of a wheel chair. Another area where the users of wheel chairs have great problems is in the 
boarding and the alighting from vehicles, particularly trains buses and motor 
vehicles. Although some buses and taxis are especially fitted to 
accommodate wheel chairs with the occupant seated in the wheel chair, 
access is still required into the vehicle. While trains and railway station 
platforms are designed to have a reasonable step for able bodied persons, 
this step still prevents the user of a wheel chair from boarding and alighting 
from the train. GB 1,572,466 describes a portable ramp for wheel chairs comprising two 
spaced parallel track members directly interconnected by a collapsible 
parallel pivotal linkage such that when collapsed the track members lie 
closely side by side for transport and/or storage when the ramp is not in use. 
While such a ramp is of assistance, it has the disadvantage that the wheels of 
the wheel chair must be aligned with the track members, and that the wheel 
chair cannot move along the ramp at an angle which may be desirable in 
some in situations. Also there is no provision for the helper to walk on the 
ramp while helping the occupant negotiate the ramp. Further more the ramp, 
while being collapsible increases the effective storage length when folded 
due to the folding of the toggle linkage between the two track members. Patent No AU 591302 discloses a wheel chair ramp which is foldable and 
portable, and has a degree of flexibility extending from, when in use, a lower 
edge to an upper edge. However this ramp has been found to be relatively 
expensive to produce and maintenance is required to the hinge attachments  
 
after a period of use. The ramp has three relatively wide portions hinged 
together by continuous hinges, such as piano hinges, and to provide a degree of 
flexibility to accommodate use on uneven or non-parallel surfaces, each of the 
portions is provided with a limited action flexible hinge extending diagonally of 
the portion. This greatly increases the construction costs of the ramp, and the 
three portions when folded result in a relatively wide unit for storage. US-A-3936898,

<CLAIMS>
A portable wheel chair ramp having at least two leaves (2, 3, 4) hinged 
together, the hinge line(s) extending in the direction of intended passage of a 

wheel chair, the hinges (5) being attached to respective adjacent leaves and 
extending between the respective adjacent leaves, characterised in that the 

hinges are constituted by fabric straps (6, 7). 
A portable wheel chair ramp as claimed in Claim 1, wherein each leaf (2, 
3, 4) has a first side and a second side and each hinge (5) comprises a pair of 

straps (6, 7) extending from one leaf to the adjacent leaf through the space 
between the leaves, one ofthe straps (6) being attached to the first side of a first 

leaf and passing between the leaves and being attached to the second side of the 
second leaf, and the other straps (7) being attached to the second side of the first 

leaf and extending between the leaves and being attached to the first side of the 
second leaf. 
A portable wheel chair ramp as claimed in Claim 2, wherein each of the 
straps (6, 7) extends continuously from one side of the ramp to the other passing 

alternately on the first and second sides of adjacent leaves (2, 3, 4). 
A portable wheel chair ramp as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, wherein each 
leaf (2, 3, 4) is provided with a longitudinal slot (25) open to one end of the leaf 

and terminating adjacent the other end of the leaf.  
 
A portable wheel chair ramp as claimed in Claim 4, wherein each of the 
straps (6, 7) forming the hinges (5) passes through the slot (25) of each leaf. 
A portable wheel chair ramp as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein the outside edge of each outside leaf (12, 15) is provided with 

an upstanding ledge (19, 20). 
A portable wheel chair ramp including longitudinal leaves (12, 13, 14, 
15) hinged together, the outer edge of the two outer leaves (12, 15) each having 

an upstanding ledge or flange (19, 20), the width of the leaves being so 

dimensioned that the leaves may be folded one on the other, characterised in 
that the ramp includes four longitudinal leaves (12, 13, 14, 15) which are hinged 

together by flexible fabric hinges. 
A portable wheel chair ramp as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims wherein each of the leaves (12, 13, 14, 15) is graduated in width so that 

the leaves will next when in a folded condition.
