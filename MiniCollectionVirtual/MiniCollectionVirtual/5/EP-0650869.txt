<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a vehicle
occupant restraint system and is specifically directed to
an apparatus for preventing deployment of an air bag
restraint when a child safety seat is secured to an
associated seat and is positioned in a rearward facing
direction.Air bag restraint systems for vehicles are well known
in the art. It is also known to prevent deployment of an
air bag during a vehicle crash when the air bag is
associated with a seat location that is unoccupied.
Deployment of an air bag associated with an unoccupied seat
location (typically the passenger seat location) during a
vehicle crash adds unnecessary expense to repair of the
vehicle.To prevent such unnecessary deployment of an air bag
at an unoccupied seat location, sensors are provided to 
detect the presence of an occupant on a vehicle seat. These
sensors include pressure sensing switches located in the seat
cushion of infrared sensors located in the vehicle dashboard or
instrument panel. If no occupant is detected as being present
on a seat, deployment of an associated air bag during a crash
condition is prevented through an appropriate control
arrangement.It is also desirable to prevent actuation of an air bag
restraint system when a child restraining seat is secured and
position in a rearward facing direction on a vehicle seat at an
associated seat location. When a rearward facing child seat is
secured to the vehicle seat, deployment of an airbag during a
vehicle crash condition would not provide the child with
additional protection since the child's head and torso would not
move relative to the child seat in the direction of vehicle
travel.Research Disclosure, December. 1992, No. 344, XP
00327165, Emsworth, GB, discusses an apparatus for inhibiting the
actuation of an airbag system when a child seat is placed on a
vehicle seat by incorporating an auxiliary buckle interposed
between a lap belt and buckle arrangement whereby the auxiliary
buckle includes an electronic chip or switch to communicate with
a mating electrical element housed in the buckle whereby such a
mating electrically activates control circuitry to modify or
inhibit the actuation of the airbag. This prior art discloses
an apparatus according to the preamble of the main claim.The present invention provides a method and apparatus
for preventing actuation of an actuatable occupant restraining
device of a vehicle according to the main independent apparatus
and method claims. Embodiments of the invention are disclosed
in the dependent claims. In accordance a
