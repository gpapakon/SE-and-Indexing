<ABSTRACT>
In the case that impelling of a supply connector 2 
is stopped before the supply connector 2 is completely 

fitted to a vehicle inlet 1, the supply connector 2 is 
returned to a half fitting position by a biasing force 

exerted in a compression coil spring 20. In this position, 
plunger balls engage with recesses 72 to temporarily 

maintain the supply connector 2 at the position in the 
vehicle inlet. Thus, an operator finds that the supply 

connector is under an incomplete state. Since the supply 
connector 2 is temporarily held in the vehicle inlet 1, 

the connector 2 is prevented from falling down from the 
inlet 1. 
A connector housing 3 is provided on its upper 
face with a flap lid 8 to close an opening of the connector 

housing 3. A torsion spring 11 is mounted on a support 
axle 10 of the flap lid 8 to normally bias the flap lid 8 

in an open direction. The connector housing 3 is provided 
on a lower portion with locking means 100 which holds the 

flap lid 8 at a closed position. The flap lid 8 is opened 
when the locking means 100 are released and the flap lid 8 

is closed when the locking means 100 are actuated. 
A connector housing 19 is provided on an area 
around a central lower earth terminal 213 with a reversed 

U-shaped groove 231. The groove 231 prevents a water 
film from spreading on a fitting face 215a of the supply 

connector 2, even if rainwater adheres to the face 215a, 
thereby preventing short circuiting between terminals. 
 
A cylindrical cap 320 is attached to a connecting 
mouth 304 of a cavity 302. A positioning hole 323 in 

the cap 320 encloses a front end of a terminal 310 with 
a little clearance. Even if an external force is applied 

to the terminal 310, it is held coaxially in the cavity 302 
without shifting the end of the terminal 310 in the cavity 

302. 
A mating terminal can be smoothly coupled to a 

fitting portion 311 on the front end of the terminal 310.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a charge coupling for
an electric vehicle.Electric vehicles will find increasing use in the
near future in view of environmental and energy concerns.
As such, the problem of a battery charging must be
overcome. In particular, a coupling for charging raises
an important problem. A charge coupling includes a vehicle
inlet or a vehicle connector installed in an electric
vehicle and a supply connector or a power source connector
connected to a power source on the ground. Charging work
is carried out under relatively high voltages.
Accordingly, conduction should be commenced after a supply
connector has been completely fitted to a vehicle inlet.In actual charging work, an operator holds the
supply connector and pushes it into the vehicle inlet.
In this case, the operator can not confirm whether or not
the supply connector is completely fitted to the vehicle
inlet, from such an operation. If the operator can not
visually determine incomplete fitting of the coupling,
he can not confirm whether or not the coupling is in
a suitable conduction state.An opening of the vehicle inlet opens outwardly
only when charging and otherwise is closed. If such
closing is incomplete, water-proofing, dust-proofing and
the like can not be effected properly. Accordingly, this
is one of most important problems. Heretofore, a lid is
rotatably attached to a vehicle inlet and is biased to
a closed position by a spring so that the lid is closed
under a state exclusive of a charging.However, such a biasing force exerted by the spring
can not positively lock the lid in the closed position.
For example, the closed lid can be readily opened by an
external force. Even if the lid is pushed onto a rubber packing on
the vehicle inlet, which serves to seal a clearance between
the lid and inlet, by a spring biasing force, the lid is
occasionally left half open.Since the lid is closed by the spring biasing force
when the external force is removed regardless of the
operator's will, substances lodge between the vehicle inlet
and the lid thereby resulting in incomplete closing.Accordingly, it is very difficult to keep the lid
in the complete closed position and to enhance reliability
of the lid only by means of the spring biasing force.It is necessary to prevent the coupling from
leaking current and shorting a circuit due to rainwater
between terminals upon charging on a rainy day. Thus, the
supply connector is provided with a lid for closure upon
non-charging and a rubber ring or the like is mounted on
a mating portion of
