<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to data processing and in 
particular to apparatus, systems and methods for distributed signal 
processing. As the tasks computing systems are required to perform increase in 
complexity, the burdens on the central processing unit (CPU), the size of the 
system memory, and the traffic on the system address and data buses all 
correspondingly increase. In particular, many types of tasks associated with 
matrix mathematics, speech synthesis, image signal processing, and digital 
signal processing are computationally intensive, often requiring the 
execution of a large number of basic arithmetic operations before a final 
result is obtained. For example, calculation of dot products is often required 
in digital signal processing applications. The calculation of a dot product 
requires the performance of number of multiplications and additions, each of 
which in conventional processing systems must be performed by the system 
central processing unit. In addition, the resulting intermediate sums and 
products must be stored and retrieved from memory as the operations 
proceed. Thus, the CPU becomes burdened not only with the task of 
performing all arithmetic operations but also with the task of controlling the 
transfer of data to and from memory. The memory in turn must be large 
enough to handle the initial raw data and all the intermediate results. 
Finally, even if multiple CPUs are used, the traffic on the associated address 
and data buses is substantial as addresses, data and results are exchanged.  Thus, the need has arisen for apparatus, systems and methods which 
more efficiently handle computationally intensive applications. Such 
apparatus, systems and methods, should ease CPU task burdens, minimize 
the amount of memory required and efficiently use bus bandwidth. Further, 
such apparatus, systems and methods should be compatible with currently 
available device and system configurations. An active memory is provided which has a data memory including 
rows and columns of storage locations for holding data and computational 
results. A broadcast memory is also provided which includes rows and 
columns of storage locations for holding control instructions. Computing 
circuitry is included which is operable to perform a first computational 
operation using first and second words of data retrieved from the data 
memory and perform a second computational operation using a result from 
the first operation and a result from a previous operation. Control
