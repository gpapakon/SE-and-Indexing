<ABSTRACT>
A laser gyro configuration and control (10) using a microprocessor (120). The microprocessor (120) has a high speed peripheral transaction system (201) which communicates through a high speed Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter (UART) (202) to a serial to parallel converter (212) through a five Byte first in first out (FIFO) (216) to an external system processor (224). The external system processor (224) sends information in a serial fashion through a single byte parallel to serial converter (208) to the high speed UART (202). Various information including gyro parameter load commands, gyro control commands, gyro status commands, and gyro calibration and diagnostic commands are sent over channels. The system provides a high speed method of controlling the laser gyro (10) and configuring it with a processor with serial transmit and receive lines.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a laser gyro system using a microprocessor for 
configuring and controlling a laser gyro with a high speed communication system. Ring laser angular rate sensors, also called laser gyros, are well known in the art. 
One example of a ring laser angular rate sensor is disclosed in US-A 4,751,718. Present 
day ring laser angular rate sensors include a thermally and mechanically stable laser block 
having a plurality of formed cavities for enclosing a gap. Mirrors are placed at the 
extremities of the cavities for reflecting laser beams and providing an optical closed-loop 
path. Such a laser gyro may incorporate a microprocessor controller. Laser gyros that utilize microprocessors for their control require that inertial 
navigation information, control information, test information, and status information be 
communicated to external systems including an inertial navigation system or a test system. 
The inclusion of a microprocessor in the laser gyro allows the implementation of new 
capabilities such as sending autonomous control functions and self testing along with self 
calibration and self diagnostics. This new capability requires the transmission and reception 
of a broad spectrum of data, some of which occurs at a high frequency rate. This laser gyro and a system using this laser gyro are discussed in "GG1308 
RING LASER GYRO INERTIAL MEASUREMENT SYSTEMS - HONEYWELL'S 
LOW COST SOLUTION FOR TACTICAL APPLICATIONS" in IEEE Plans 20 March 
1990, pp. 528-536.  
 The article discusses a small, low cost 
inertial sensor and system. The system includes a 
three laser gyros, three accelerometers, a high voltage 
power supply, low voltage power connection and dither 
and path length control systems in a common housing. 
External system support electronics and software are 
connected to the elements inside the housing through 
glass to metal sealed pins. The invention provides a laser gyro 
configuration and control mechanism that utilizes an 
onboard microcontroller with a high speed Universal 
Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter (UART) that 
interfaces through a transmit line and a receive line 
to an external system. The microprocessor communicates 
through a set of predetermined registers that have a 
structure lending itself to high speed data 
communications. The microprocessor sends a command tag 
along with inertial navigation data and status data. 
The external system communicates to the laser gyro 
through a similar mechanism. The laser gyro includes a 
personality storage
