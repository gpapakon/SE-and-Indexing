<ABSTRACT>
Known prior art film cassettes for use with 
X-ray film materials do not provide good film contact 

between the intensifying screen and the film located 
therein. This is because the foam pad used provides 

relatively little force at the edge areas of the film 
as opposed to the areas distal from the edges. 

Described herein is an improved film cassette (12, 14, 
16) having a base (14) and a cover (12) which is 

hinged (16) to the base (14) for closing the same and 
providing a light-tight space therebetween. A cushion 

member is secured in to the inside surface of the 
cover and an intensifying screen is secured to the 

outer surface of the cushion member. The cushion 
member comprises an inner layer and an outer layer 

secured together, the inner layer being secured to the 
cover (12). The inner layer is made of a material 

having a first density and the outer layer of a 
material having a second density which is greater than 

the first density such that a substantially uniform 
pressure is applied against the film placed in the 

space between the cover (12) and the base (14).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cassette 
for holding a photosensitive material, and more 
particularly, to a cassette which is particularly 
suited for holding X-ray film designed for use in 
mammography. Typical prior art film cassettes comprise a 
cover which is hingedly mounted to a base such that 
when the cover is closed on the base, there is 
provided a light-tight space therebetween for 
receiving photosensitive X-ray film. Secured to the 
inside surface of the cover is a foam pad having an 
intensifying screen secured to its outer surface. 
When the cover is in the closed position, the foam pad 
and intensifying screen pushes the X-ray film firmly 
against the base of the cassette. Appropriate 
latching means are provided for latching and 
unlatching the cover with respect to the base. With 
cassettes which are designed for use in mammography it 
is important that the film be placed closely adjacent 
the edge of the cassette which is placed against the 
patient and that the best possible image be obtained 
along the edge as well as in the central area of the 
film. A problem experienced with prior art 
cassettes is that there is a lack of good film contact 
between the intensifying screen and the adjacent a-ray 
film, especially along the edges of the film. Foam 
pads used in prior art cassettes typically comprise a 
single layer of a resilient material. The foam pad 
generally provides relatively little force at the edge 
areas of the film as opposed to the areas distal from 
the edges. Additionally, the latching mechanism is 
often provided adjacent the edge of the cassette to be 
placed against the patient. The foam pad and attached 
intensifying screen is simply placed directly over the  
 
latching mechanism which further contributes to 
inconsistent uniform contact between the intensifying 
screen and film in this area. It is therefore an object of the present 
invention to provide an improved cassette which 
minimizes or eliminates many of the problems of the 
prior art and which is easy and economical to 
manufacture. In accordance with one aspect of the present 
invention, there is provided a cassette for a 
photosensitive element comprising:-
 
   a first cassette portion;
 
   a second cassette portion secured to the 
first cassette portion for movement between an open 
position and a closed position, the first cassette 
portion and the second cassette portion forming a 
light tight space therebetween for receiving a 
photosensitive element when the cassette is in the 
closed
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A cassette (10) for a photosensitive 
element comprising:- 

   a first cassette portion (14); 
   a second cassette portion (12) secured to 

the first cassette portion for movement between an 
open position and a closed position, the first 

cassette portion (14) and the second cassette portion 
(12) forming a light tight space therebetween for 

receiving a photosensitive element when the cassette 
(10) is in the closed position; 

   characterized in that the cassette (10) 
further comprises a cushion pad assembly (60, 64, 66) 

secured to the inner surface of the second cassette 
portion (12) comprising an inner layer (64) and an 

outer layer (66), the inner layer (64) being adjacent 

the inner surface of the second cassette portion (12)
