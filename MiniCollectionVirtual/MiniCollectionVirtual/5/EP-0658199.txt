<ABSTRACT>
The recombinant production of PDGF-AB in mammalian cells is disclosed by means of a bicistronic vector system in which an IRES sequence is located between the first and second cistrons and in which the B chain coding gene is located in the first cistron. The disclosed expression unit allows the equimolar expression of the A and B polypeptide chains.
