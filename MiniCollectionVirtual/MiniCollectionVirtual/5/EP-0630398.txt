<ABSTRACT>
Process for preparing emulsified fuels with a high water content (5 to 35 % by weight) comprising various additives consisting of minor specific quantities of sorbitan oleate, polyalkylene-glycol and alkylphenol ethoxylate. The fuel used as ingredient is preferably diesel-oil, petrol, kerosene, fuel-oil or coal dust. The results of tests show that polluting gases can be greatly reduced during combustion of emulsified fuels. Emulsified fuels also reduce fuel combustion to a large extent.

<CLAIMS>
An emulsified combustible comprising specific quantities of fuel and an 
assembly of additives in a minor quantity, said combustible containing from 5 

to 35% by weight of water, the assembly of additives being present in a 
proportion of 0.1% by weight minimum, preferably from 0.1% to 1.5% by 

weight, and essentially composed of specific quantities of sorbitan oleate, 
polyalkylene-glycol and alkylphenol ethoxylate. 
The combustible of Claim 1, in which said fuel is selected from the group 
of diesel-oils, petrols, kerosenes, fuel-oils and coal dusts. 
The combustible of Claim 1, said sorbitan oleate being sorbitan 
sesquioleate. 
The combustible of Claim 3, said sorbitan sesquioleate being present in a 
proportion of 0.05 to 0.25% by weight. 
The combustible of Claim 3, said sorbitan sesquioleate being present in a 
proportion of 0.20 to 0.25% by weight. 
The combustible of Claim 1, said polyalkylene-glycol being polyethylene-glycol. 
The combustible of Claim 6, said polyethylene-glycol being present in a 
proportion of 0.05 to 0.25% by weight. 
The combustible of Claim 6, said polyethylene-glycol being present in a 
proportion of 0.20 to 0.25% by weight. 
The combustible of Claim 1, said alkylphenol ethoxylate being nonylphenol 
ethoxylate. 
The combustible of Claim 9, said alkylphenol ethoxylate being present 
in a proportion of 0.05 to 0.25% by weight. 
The combustible of Claim 9, said nonylphenol ethoxylate being present 
in a proportion of 0.20 to 0.25% by weight.  

 
The combustible of Claim 1, said assembly of additives further comprising 
specific minor quantities of an aromatic toluenic product and an alkyl 

benzene. 
The combustible of Claim 12, said aromatic toluenic product comprising 
toluene. 
The combustible of Claim 13, said toluene being present in a proportion 
of 0.05 to 0.15% by weight. 
The combustible of Claim 12, said alkyl benzene being composed of a 
mixture of dialkyl benzenes with a molecular weight of 355 to 385. 
The combustible of Claim 15, said mixture being present in a proportion 
of 0.03 to 0.075% by weight. 
A method for reducing pollutant gases resulting from the combustion of 
fuels and/or for reducing the consumption of fuel, said method comprising the 

following steps: 

mixing a certain quantity of fuel with an assembly of additives and 
preparing from the mixture obtained an emulsified combustible containing 5 

to 35% by weight of water, 
said assembly of additives being present in a proportion of 0.1 to 1.5% 
by weight and being essentially composed of specific quantities of sorbitan 

oleate, polyalkylene-glycol and alkylphenol ethoxylate, 
effecting combustion of said mixture. 
Process for manufacturing combustible according to any one of Claims 1 
to 16, characterized in that the assembly of additives is completely mixed with 

the hydrocarbon heated to a temperature of 30 to 60Â°C, before adding the 
water, the mixing operations being carried out in a static mixer under an 

internal pressure higher than or equal to 5 x 10
5
 Pa, the ingredients, except for 
the hydrocarbon, being used at ambient temperature.
