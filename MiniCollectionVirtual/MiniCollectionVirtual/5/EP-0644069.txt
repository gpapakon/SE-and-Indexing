<ABSTRACT>
A support part of a vehicle, preferably intended for movement on non-protected ground, consisting of a wheel, crawler belt 
or a shoe of a walking vehicle, comprises supporting elements transmitting the pressure on the ground and capable of driving 

the ground from under the surface of contact of the support part with the ground, and consisting, in particular, of a plurality of 
contact surfaces with passages for the ground between them. The contact surfaces are arranged preferably in pairs and 

symmetrically in relation to the direction of movement of the vehicle, the angle between the surfaces being less than 180 Â°. A 
vehicle with the described support part exercises a reduced tightening and structure destructing influence on the ground and 

has a higher cross-country capability.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to means of transportation and more
specifically to its support parts such as wheels, crawler
belts or skids of walking vehicles. In particular, the
invention relates to the wheels of a transportation means,
more strictly, to special constructions of the wheels
including ones of high resiliency and wheels having
compound rims.This invention relates also to such means of transportation
which exercise a minimized tightening and structure
destructuring influence on the ground.An essential problem of designing and implementation of a
transportation means for movement on the bare surface
(non-protected ground) is the problem of decreasing the
ground structure destruction and excluding the undesirable
overtightening of the ground.This problem is particularly critical in agriculture, where
the overtightening of the ground under influence of
agricultural machines, especially of a great power and
weight, leads to the soil structure destruction which may
be irreversible to some level of influence, and finally to
soil degradation.This problem is also critical for the movement on marshy
and soft ground, in particular, in subarctic regions where 
the tightening influence on the ground of a transportation
means leads to the destruction of a weak vegetation layer
and creates serious ecological problems, and for the
movement on sand dunes and deserts where the coersion of a
support parts of the transportation means on the ground
leads to the deepening ("bogging down" or "digging in") of
such parts and as a result to the sharp increase of
required power and consequently to the increase of fuel
consumption, increased wear and so on.This problem has been solved in the known state of the art
by increasing the contact surface of the support parts of a
transportation means (wheels, crawler belts, skids of a
walking vehicle) with the ground, which naturally leads to
the decreasing of the unit pressure to the ground.But the possibility of increasing the surface contact of
the support parts of a transportation means with the aim of
decreasing of the unit pressure to the ground is limited by
constructive and clearance requirements. So, it is not
always possible to reduce the tightening influence or
compaction of the ground to the extent acceptable from the
point of view of agriculture. There is the need in
additional ways of restoration of fertility of the soil.
For example, there is quite a number of inventions related
to means of loosening soil tightened by support parts of a
transportation means, known
