<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to terfenadine derivatives having 
antihistaminic activity, the process for their preparation and the 
relative pharmaceutical compositions. Terfenadine, i.e. α-[4-(1,1-dimethylethyl)phenyl]-4-(4-hydroxyphenylmethyl)-1-piperidinebutanol, 
an antihistaminic compound 
commercially available as a variety of products (Seldan®, Teldane®), is 
a selective antagonist of histaminergic receptor H₁ and is used in the 
theraphy for the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitides and of other 
diseases for which histamine is held to be responsible. Terfenadine is considered a choice antiallergic, compared with the 
traditional antihistamines, such as chlorpheniramine, diphenhydramine, 
promethazine, and triprolidine, as it produces on the central nervous 
system less important untoward side effects of the anticholinergic, 
antiserotoninergic, antiadrenergic, and antihistaminic type (psychomotor 
disorders, sedation, dryness of fauces (J.K. Woodward, N.L. Munro, 
Arzneim. Forsch. Drug Res., 32, 1154, 1982; A.N. Nicholson, Arzneim. 
Forsch. Drug Res., 32, 1191, 1992). This notwithstanding, in patients 
suffering from liver complaint or being administered drugs slowing down 
the metabolism (Ketoconazole, erythromycin), terfenadine may produce 
effects on the heart rhythm that may result even fatal (Chem. Eng. News, 
p. 26, June 1993). It may be hypothesized that the observed cardiotoxic effects are due to 
the fact that the metabolism of terfenadine is slowed down by the  
 
administration of the above drugs. Terfenadine biotransformation in man produces a series of metabolites, 
the principal being 4-[1-hydroxy-4-(4-hydroxydiphenylmethyl)piperidinyl]butyl-α,α-dimethylphenylacetic 
acid and azacyclonol. The carboxylated metabolite exhibits a potent antihistaminic activity and 
one of its two enantiomers has been assumed to be responsible for 
cardiotoxic phenomena. In the organism, the carboxylated metabolite undergoes a variety of 
metabolic reactions (such as conjugation reactions) favouring the 
elimination of same before an optimal therapeutic activity is achieved. The present invention relates to terfenadine derivatives of formula (I) 
where R₁, which is in position 1 or 2 of the tetrazole ring, stands for 
H, or a linear or branched alkyl group containing from 1 to 6 carbon 
atoms; R₂ and R₃, different from one another, are selected between H and 
OH, and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. When R₁=H, structures (I)₁ and (I)₂, where R₁=H is in position 1 and 2,
