<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a GPI-anchored p97 and a soluble form of p97 and derivatives thereof and methods for preparing the same. Methods of using p97 in modulating iron transport, in the delivery of therapeutic agents, and in the treatment of conditions involving disturbances in iron metabolism are described. The treatment and diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease in view of the finding that p97 and transferrin receptor are markers for microglial cells associated with senile plaques are also described.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to GPI-anchored p97, a
secreted form of p97 and derivatives thereof; methods of
using p97 in modulating iron transport, in the delivery of
drugs, and in the treatment of conditions involving
disturbances in iron metabolism; and methods of treating
and diagnosing Alzheimer's Disease.Iron is a fundamental component required by all cells
for growth and normal physiological processes (Crichton,
R.R. and Charloteaux-Wauters, M. Eur. J. Biochem. 164:485-506
and Ponka, P. et al, Iron Transport and Storage, CRC
Press, Boca Raton, Ann Arbor and Boston, 1990). Rapidly
proliferating cells have a higher iron requirement than
quiescent cells. In humans this iron requirement is
thought to be provided by the binding of iron to the major
serum iron-transporting protein, transferrin. Transferrin
bound to iron can bind as a complex to the transferrin
receptor expressed on the plasma membrane (Ponka, P. et
al, Iron Transport and Storage, CRC Press, Boca Raton, Ann
Arbor and Boston, 1990). After binding, the
iron/transferrin/transferrin receptor complex remains
membrane bound and is concentrated and then endocytosed
via endocytotic vesicles. The endosomes become acidified
and the iron is released from the complex within the cell
and the apotransferrin remains bound to the receptor and
is recycled to the surface where it is released to
participate in the uptake of further iron into the cell
(Kuhn L.C. et al., in Iron Transport and Storage, CRC
Press, Boca Raton, Ann Arbor and Boston, 1990, p. 149).Disruption of blood circulation deprives cells of
oxygen and iron and may result in cell death. Deposition
of iron from cell death, for example in ischemic injury
may result in the generation of highly reactive and toxic 
superoxide or hydroxyl free radicals which can result in
further tissue damage. Accordingly, the abundance of iron
and its availability can greatly alter survival of damaged
tissues. Rapidly proliferating cells, such as malignant
cells, have an increased requirement for iron and must
possess efficient mechanisms to obtain iron. Limiting the
ability of malignant cells to acquire iron may provide a
method of killing tumor cells or of modulating their
uncontrolled cell growth.Although cellular iron uptake has been shown to be
mediated mainly by the transferrin receptor (Doering, T.L.
et al, J. Biol. Chem. 265:611-614, (1990), a non-transferrin-mediated
pathway has been implicated for iron
incorporation into cells, including leukemic cells
(Basset, P. et al, Cancer Res. 46:1644-1647,
