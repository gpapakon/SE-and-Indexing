<ABSTRACT>
In a method for regulating the weight per unit area or sliver weight of the end product of a fibre-processing machine (1) with a control (10), the following method steps are provided: weighing the quantity of spinning material fed per unit time to the fibre-processing machine (1), presetting a desired value (P) for the weight per unit area or sliver weight of the end product at the exit (8) of the fibre-processing machine (1) or of a machine downstream of the fibre-processing machine (1), and inputting the desired value (P) as a first input parameter into the control (10), measuring the actual value (V) of the plant speed at the exit (8) of the fibre-processing machine (1) or of a machine downstream of the fibre-processing machine (1), and inputting the actual value (V) as a second input parameter into the control (10), presetting a correcting parameter (K) for taking into account fibre-specific textile and climatic influencing factors, and inputting the correcting parameter (K) as a third input parameter into the control (10), and calculating a desired value (Y), by means of the control (10) for regulating the draw-in speed at the entry of the fibre-processing machine (1) downstream of the weighing operation, from the continuously measured actual value (Pact, Vact) of the quantity of spinning material fed and from the input parameters (P, V, K), and controlling the draw-in speed at the entry of the fibre-processing machine (1) downstream of the weighing operation.
