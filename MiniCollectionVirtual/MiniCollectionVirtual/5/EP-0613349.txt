<ABSTRACT>
Eliminates the need for tying knots in sutures. The clip (20) is slidable in an open position along sutures (12) that extend from a suturing site. With the clip (20) at the suturing site, the sutures (12) are tensed and the clip is forced into a closed position that fixes the position of the clip (20) relative to the sutures (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
 SUTURE CLIPTECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates to clips used in surgical procedures and particularly to clips for securing the free ends of sutures.BACKGROUND INFORMATION Sutures are commonly used to close incisions and to reunite damaged tissue. Typically, the sutures are passed through the tissue and the free ends of the sutures are tied together. In many instances, the suturing site is exposed to an extent that is sufficient to permit the surgeon to quickly tie the suture by hand. However, in some procedures, such as arthroscopic surgery, the suturing site is inaccessible by hand. As a result, the surgeon must tie the suture ends into a knot at a location remote from the suture site, and then manipulate suitably configured instruments for sliding the knot to the site. For example, an arthroscopic surgical procedure usually employs a small-diameter cannula that extends through a small incision made in a joint. The sutures extend from the suturing site through the cannula. The exposed free ends of the sutures are tied by the surgeon and the knot is slid through the cannula to the suturing site. Such a suturing procedure is time consuming and can result in knots that do not hold the suture ends with sufficient tension to securely reunite the tissue.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a suture clip that eliminates the need for tying knots in suture ends. The clip is slidable along a suture or pair of sutures from a remote location to a suturing site. With the clip at the suturing site, the suture is tensed and the clip is closed against the suture to securely fasten the suture at the site. The suture clip of the present invention comprises a pair of legs attached together at one end by a hinge. The clip is made of resilient material, such as plastic. The clip is configured so that the elasticity of 

 the plastic biases the legs toward a generally V-shaped orientation that defines the open position of the clip. Prongs are attached to one leg for holding both legs together in a closed position. The prongs and clip legs define a passageway whenever the clip is in an open position. The free ends of a suture are threaded through the passageway. With the sutures threaded through the passageway, the open suture clip may be slid along the sutures without passing laterally away from the sutures because the passageway surrounds the sutures. The clip is slid down the sutures and passed through the arthroscopic incision until it reaches a position adjacent to the tissue where the suture is to be

<CLAIMS>
CLAIMS 1. A suture clip comprising: a first leg; a second leg attached to the first leg, the first and second leg being movable relative to one another; and positioning means for positioning the first and second legs at a first position to define a passageway that is configured for substantially surrounding a suture that may be threaded through the passageway, and for positioning the first and second legs at a second position for securing the threaded suture relative to the clip.
2. The suture clip according to claim 1, wherein the legs are attached by a resilient hinge for urging the legs into the first position. 3. The suture clip according to claim 1, wherein the clip is made of resilient material for biasing the first and second legs into the first position.
4. The suture clip according to claim 1, wherein the clip is formed of one piece. 5. The suture clip according to claim 1, wherein the positioning means includes a prong attached to one leg to define part of the passageway when the legs are in the first position.
6. The suture clip according to claim , wherein the positioning means includes: a prong made of resilient material and attached to one leg and having a hook on one end for engaging the second leg.
7. The suture clip according to claim 6, wherein the hook is configured to engage the second leg to lock the first and second legs in the second position.
8. The suture clip of claim 6, wherein the positioning means further includes a second prong having a hook on one end, the second prong attached to one leg to define part of the passageway when the legs are in the first position.
9. A one-piece suture clip made from a resilient material and comprising: 


 a first and second leg attached by a hinge and movable relative to each other between a first position and a second position; a prong attached to one leg, the prong and legs defining a passageway that is configured for substantially surrounding a suture that may be threaded through the passageway, the prong being configured for securing the legs in the second position for holding the threaded suture immovable within the passage. 10. The suture clip according to claim .9, wherein the hook is configured to engage the second leg to lock the first and second legs in the second position.
11. A method for fastening a suture near a suturing site, comprising the steps: providing a suture connected at a suturing site and having a free end; threading the free end through a passageway formed in a clip with the passageway surrounding the suture; sliding the clip along the suture to a position adjacent to the suturing site; and locking the clip to the suture.
12. The method of claim 11 wherein locking the clip prevents movement relative to the clip of a suture that is threaded through the passageway.
13. A method of fastening a suture that has a portion anchored at a suturing site and free ends, comprising the steps of: threading the free ends of the suture through a passageway formed in a closable clip; sliding the clip along the suture to a position adjacent to the suturing site such that the suture guides the clip to the suturing site; and closing the clip to fasten the clip to the suture.
14. A method of securing a suture near a suturing site, comprising the steps of: providing a suture having free ends; 


 providing a clip having a closable passageway formed therein; threading the free ends through the passageway ; sliding the clip along the suture to a position adjacent to the suturing site; and closing the clip.
