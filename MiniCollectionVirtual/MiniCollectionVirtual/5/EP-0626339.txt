<ABSTRACT>
In order to create an overhead crane (10) which is less expensive, more rigid and lighter compared with known telescopic overhead cranes, at least one vertically arranged guide beam (16) is provided for a lifting shaft (17). The lifting shaft (17) preferably carries two working platforms (22, 23) at a vertical distance from one another. The lifting shaft (17) can be moved up and down in a rotationally locked manner along the guide beam (16), for example by rope winches (19) driven by electric motor. The working platforms (22, 23) are equipped with extendable sliding platforms (25) so that, for example, adaptation to the curvature of the fuselage of an aircraft to be maintained can be effected.
